      "body": "<p>These last few days seem to have gone by in a sort of daze. The foot and mouth disease we all dreaded has hit the valley, with Nick and I being the first confirmed case on Tuesday morning. Keith Benn was confirmed Wednesday and no doubt there will be others.</p> <p>Nick noticed on Monday morning when he fed the 60 ewes in the 2nd Croft that one old girl didn't come. He went to look for her and as he approached she ran with a limp to the food. He mentioned his concern for her at lunchtime and said she would need to be examined. After lunch, he went back to the field; although she seemed fine, he decided he would still catch her. On examination, he found two small cuts on her upper gums but nothing on her feet. He brought her home and called me to have a look.</p> <p>Although it wasn't an obvious case, we felt we had to let the Ministry of Agriculture know. Vet arrived at 6.30pm, an American girl, drafted over with five others to help with the crisis. It was her first case so was very unsure. We went to look at the others in the field, caught a sheep we were suspicious of; it showed no clinical signs, but decided to bring her home too. By 9.30pm, Ellen, the vet, said she would have to get a second opinion and would come the next morning with a senior vet. Nick and I slept very little and at 4am decided to get up and go and see the two sheep. They seemed to be fine and certainly no worse. We milked the cows and did all the necessary routine work in the yard, feeding young stock etc. When I went to feed the calves and sheep over the road, I put some sheep rolls into the trough of the two isolated ewes. They ate immediately, so naturally I was very optimistic.</p> <p>Ellen arrived around 10.30am with the more experienced vet. It was Richard, my nephew, and we could not have asked for anyone better; he was absolutely wonderful. After diagnosing the ewe as foot and mouth, and picking out four more from the flock of 60 she was running with, he rang London to confirm. Nick and I were devastated and for about 10 minutes Nick just went to pieces. Thankfully, Richard took over and organised everything; by 1pm, he had the ministry man, the valuers, the slaughter men and the sergeant from the Army in the yard.</p> <p>I had expressed to Richard that Nick did not want his beloved cows burned on a pyre. He and Chris, the Army man, decided it needed to be a swift departure because they could easily become a hazard to the sheep on the fell that wandered about the roads encroaching upon the farm. This was a real blessing as some farmers have their animals lying dead and rotting around them for up to nine days before they are disposed of. Nick helped to pen the sheep because he was the only one who could work a dog. He then came into the house and we closed the curtains and stayed in. They were all slaughtered by 6pm.</p> <p>Shortly after we came into the house, the telephone began to ring and we had a constant flow of family, neighbours and friends ringing with comforting words. Some knew what we were going through because they had already been through it, but all had a bond of unity and love. Richard stayed until around 9pm, long after the others had been fed and left. He sorted out signs on gates and disinfected footbaths and sprayed the dead animals with disinfectant. He then gave us both a hug and told us we would be all right because we still had each other. The phone went silent at around 11.15pm. We went to bed exhausted.</p> <p>Next morning (Wednesday) was very weird. We awoke as usual at 5.30, both with shocking bad heads caused by the tension from the previous day. After taking a couple of Paracetamols each we got back into bed! In the 32 years we have been at Mosedale End we have never had a lie-in except when we have been ill. There were no sounds from the yard, no ewes bleating, no cows blaring or munching at the silage outside our bedroom window; we felt a real sadness at the silence.</p> <p>We didn't go back to sleep but we did talk things through. What were our options? Where do we go from here? All Nick wanted to do the previous day was to sell the remaining implements and retire from farming. Now on reflection, especially as the grandchildren were so upset the night before at the thought of no lambs at Mosedale, Nick thought maybe we could have a flock of sheep again. The biggest problem, of course, will be hefting the sheep on the fell again. They have grazed on a certain area on the back of Skiddaw for generations; there are no fences yet they never stray from their patch. But Nick thinks with God's help, the dogs, and his experience, he can do it.</p> <p>We got up around 6.30, had baths and hair washed ready for Chris and David, the ministry man, arriving at 7.30am. By 1pm, the wagons had arrived to pick up the sheep but a mix-up at the Maff offices had resulted in no wagons for the cattle. Chris was on the telephone immediately. We had a wonderful team of men working with us.</p> <p>Eight-thirty on Thursday morning, the wagons for the cattle arrived, plus the men to do a preliminary disinfecting of the yards and the road through the village. Chris said we were the first in Cumbria to be diagnosed, slaughtered and the animals off the farm within 48 hours.</p> <p>We can now only look to the future. I felt God gave us a great inspiration of hope on a most devastating day. As I went into the byre where the young stock were, on that Tuesday, the first swallow of spring flew in, chittered, flew around then back out again. I just felt God was saying: 'Winter is passed, here comes spring.' It gave me a real ray of hope. Even in the darkest of times, Jesus can shine His light. ('When Jesus spoke again to the people, He said, \"I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life\".')</p> <p>The ministry have told us it will be around the end of May before anyone will be allowed back on the farm. The whole place has to be thoroughly cleaned, washed and disinfected. Everything has to be burned, straw, hay, even the sawdust. After all this has been done, we would love to have you come and stay with us for a few days.</p>",

On Friday Agriculture Minister Nick Brown admitted that the Government was being overwhelmed by the number of livestock which needed to be slaughtered and then disposed of. Yesterday figures revealed that 408,000 carcasses were lying in fields waiting to be buried or burnt, and that more than 500,000 were awaiting slaughter.</p> <p>William Hague, the leader of the Opposition, said that it was time for the Army to be put in operational control of the epidemic as Maff was clearly failing to cope. 'The speed of the slaughter process still needs to be speeded up further,' he said. 'In about 40 per cent of foot and mouth outbreaks, the animals aren't being slaughtered within 24 hours.'</p> <p>But a letter obtained by The Observer, written by one of Britain's leading experts on waste disposal, reveals high levels of concern about the public health implications of the new policy.</p> <p>The letter, written by Dirk Hazell, head of the Environmental Services Association which represents landfill companies, says: 'We are extremely concerned at any pressure exerted on our members to receive carcasses of cattle at landfill.</p> <p>'Until the outbreak of foot and mouth disease, cattle carcasses over 30 months old were being sent to prescribed outlets (high temperature incineration). We are extremely concerned as to the known resilience and potential toxicity of the BSE prion. The high risk associated with the prion means that much greater caution must be exercised than with the foot and mouth virus which is much less resilient and does not damage human health.</p> <p>'The order of magnitude in the difference between the prion and the virus is similar to that between Alzheimer's disease and athlete's foot.</p> <p>'It was not considered safe before the outbreak to landfill carcasses of cattle aged between 30 months and 60 months and we must emphatically insist that our members must have a watertight, permanent and comprehensive indemnity.'</p> <p>In Northern Ireland a cull of 4,000 cattle was ordered after the province suffered its second case of foot and mouth disease, six weeks after the first case and several weeks after Government controls were supposed to have halted the spread of the disease to new areas.</p> <p>Northern Ireland Agriculture Minister, Brid Rodgers, confirmed that an emergency meeting of the Northern Ireland Executive would be held tomorrow to discuss the fresh outbreak. 'It goes without saying that this is a huge setback for our agriculture industry,' he said.</p> <p>The outbreak, on a farm in Ardboe, Co Tyrone, reveals that the disease can lie dormant for weeks, or that it can be carried on the wind across large distances from the British mainland.</p> <p>Maff is so concerned about a public backlash on the issue of human health that it has started offering families complaining of the smell of rotting carcasses in north Devon temporary accommodation.</p> <p><b>Email update</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/email\">Sign up for our free daily foot and mouth round-up</a><br><br><b>More on the election and foot and mouth</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/footandmouth\">Politics: foot and mouth</a></p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/list\">Full list: outbreaks </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,464555,00.html\">Graph: rise in cases</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,460510,00.html\">Full list: closed &amp; cancelled</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\">Causes and effects</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/theissues/article/0,6512,441031,00.html\">The issue explained</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,471911,00.html\">11.04.2001: Foot and mouth in Europe</a></p> <p><b>The front line: meet those affected by the crisis</b><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,467836,00.html\">03.04.2001: Straws in the wind</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html\">06.03.2001: Meet our panel</a><br> <br></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,472375,00.html\">12.04.2001: Maff halts release of foot and mouth figures</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,472342,00.html\">12.04.2001: Take Easter break in countryside, urges PM</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,472066,00.html\">12.04.2001: Epidemic 'past its peak' but some areas defy trend</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,472057,00.html\">12.04.2001: 'We aren't moving.

Under new guidelines to relax the rules governing the disposal of carcasses, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has told Britain's waste industry that it must use landfill sites across the country to dispose of cattle which might be infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). As the Government battled yesterday to stop a political backlash over its handling of the issue, representatives of companies that operate landfill sites demanded 'unlimited indemnity' from the Government in case the infective prion which causes BSE in cattle escapes and causes human variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans. The companies fear they will be liable to law suits running into billions of pounds if the source of any new outbreak of human variant CJD is traced back to them. 'It would be a public health disaster,' said one senior source in the industry.

'The speed of the slaughter process still needs to be speeded up further,' he said. 'In about 40 per cent of foot and mouth outbreaks, the animals aren't being slaughtered within 24 hours.' But a letter obtained by The Observer, written by one of Britain's leading experts on waste disposal, reveals high levels of concern about the public health implications of the new policy. The letter, written by Dirk Hazell, head of the Environmental Services Association which represents landfill companies, says: 'We are extremely concerned at any pressure exerted on our members to receive carcasses of cattle at landfill. 'Until the outbreak of foot and mouth disease, cattle carcasses over 30 months old were being sent to prescribed outlets (high temperature incineration). We are extremely concerned as to the known resilience and potential toxicity of the BSE prion. The high risk associated with the prion means that much greater caution must be exercised than with the foot and mouth virus which is much less resilient and does not damage human health. 'The order of magnitude in the difference between the prion and the virus is similar to that between Alzheimer's disease and athlete's foot. 'It was not considered safe before the outbreak to landfill carcasses of cattle aged between 30 months and 60 months and we must emphatically insist that our members must have a watertight, permanent and comprehensive indemnity.' In Northern Ireland a cull of 4,000 cattle was ordered after the province suffered its second case of foot and mouth disease, six weeks after the first case and several weeks after Government controls were supposed to have halted the spread of the disease to new areas. Northern Ireland Agriculture Minister, Brid Rodgers, confirmed that an emergency meeting of the Northern Ireland Executive would be held tomorrow to discuss the fresh outbreak. 'It goes without saying that this is a huge setback for our agriculture industry,' he said. The outbreak, on a farm in Ardboe, Co Tyrone, reveals that the disease can lie dormant for weeks, or that it can be carried on the wind across large distances from the British mainland. Maff is so concerned about a public backlash on the issue of human health that it has started offering families complaining of the smell of rotting carcasses in north Devon temporary accommodation.

      "body": "<p>For a man who has just had his second controversial profits warning in a month, Fran Rooney is in a surprisingly upbeat mood. </p> <p>The soft-talking chief executive of Baltimore Technologies, the Dublin-based hi-tech company that was once the darling of the stock markets, has some tricks up his sleeve. 'We have very serious plans for the company, and this market has only just started. I and the board are very committed to it.' </p> <p>He will need to be committed. The shares plunged last week when he told the market that he would have to shave another \u00a31.3 million off the expected earnings for the first quarter of the year. In the context of the great hi-tech bear market, that amount is relatively small. But the news caused Baltimore shares, which were once flying high at more then \u00a313.50, to lose another 20 per cent, closing at 74p. That puts a value on the London and Nasdaq-quoted stock of less than \u00a3400m. </p> <p>This is a humiliating fall from the levels of just a year ago, when Baltimore briefly elbowed its way into the FTSE 100 with a capitalisation of \u00a34.5bn. But Rooney has learned to be wary of the caprices of the stock market. </p> <p>The date 23 March will be forever engraved on Rooney's heart. He arranged a briefing for analysts at Chief O'Neill's hotel in Dublin's glitzy Smithfield, intended mainly to introduce the investment community to some new faces on the board. One analyst interpreted his comments to mean that Baltimore's business was slowing down, and promptly walked out to tell his clients to dump the stock. They did, and began a stampede that ended with Baltimore losing nearly a third of its value in just a few hours. No wonder last week's announcement was much better handled. </p> <p>'The market is very sensitive about companies in our sector. Shareholders are keen to see where real value lies,' says Rooney. In fact, last week's announcement bears testimony to the effect of the O'Neill's d\u00e9bcle. The reason Rooney again had to prune forecasts was because some customers used the 23 March warning to delay signing deals with Baltimore, hoping to get a better price later on from the (supposedly) cash-strapped company. </p> <p>Rooney, who has been feted as Mr New Economy by presidents and prime ministers on both sides of the Atlantic, has the chance to get his revenge on the market. He believes the clients who held back last quarter will soon sign up, on the same terms, and will boost second-quarter earnings. 'These deals are very close to being signed,' he said from New York. 'Closing big software deals takes some time. It's not as though somebody just phones you up and you send an invoice. We are currently at the letter-of-intent stage.' </p> <p>Baltimore's business could not be any nearer the sharp end of the new economy. It provides security and authorisation software for banks, securities houses, and government agencies that use the internet commercially on a daily basis. His clients include the US Central Intelligence Agency, and Britain's Ministry of Defence and Metropolitan Police. None of those organisations has a reputation for welching on their debts, or for driving a particularly hard bargain. </p> <p>But Rooney sees the way forward for Baltimore in the new business stream. 'There is quite a substantial pipeline of new business coming through, especially with the banks and telecoms companies. The security infrastructure of internet operations is a real growth opportunity. For example, we've just done a deal with the Australian tax office which could be the start of things to come in other countries.' </p> <p>He has also recently signed deals with Nokia and Motorola to provide security systems for their growing internet access businesses, and has targeted the Japanese telecoms market for further expansion. </p> <p>So, for a company supposedly in the doldrums, Baltimore is feeling reasonably optimistic. 'We have to just keep on doing the deals we're doing, and get on with the business,' says Rooney. 'It's been a distraction over the past few weeks, having to reassure the market about prospects, but now we have to carry on with the business.' </p> <p>He sees scope in licensing Baltimore's services to banks and telecoms companies whose web services will be managed by Baltimore - for a substantial fee. </p> <p>In terms of market share, Baltimore is doing well, albeit in a bombed-out market. It recently overtook Entrust as the market leader, and the number one ranking should win it more business. </p> <p>The financial background is encouraging. Even on the reduced first-quarter figures, there is still 150 per cent growth, year on year. After a call on shareholders last year, and even allowing for the expansion spree that has seen 60 per cent of the business coming from outside Europe, the company has \u00a3130m cash in the bank. 'That's enough to keep us going for three years, even if we never make a profit,'adds Rooney. </p> <p>There was once speculation that Microsoft might want to bid for Baltimore, which Rooney sarcastically turned on its head by suggesting that it was just as likely that Baltimore might take over Bill Gates's company. </p> <p>Now his ambitions with the world's leading computer company are more limited, but none the less significant. 'As the internet becomes a day-to-day method of doing business, the next big thing will be the need to authenticate yourself. We are the only company in the world that provides that kind of service, especially in the field of public key infrastructure, and we see a great opportunity to co-operate with Windows 2000 on this.' </p> <p>He is a firm believer in the new economy, but is also a realist. 'The internet is not going away, but the downturn will force people to look at ways of using the internet more efficiently. The priorities will be to build a web presence, and to make it secure. It's in the second part of that where we will benefit. I think we'll see less \"free\" access. The net will become a subscription-based service, which will require authentication. That's our speciality.' </p> <p>The people who walked out of Chief O'Neill's, some of whom still have reservations about the company, will be glad to hear all this, but their immediate concern is to hear how Baltimore will tackle its comparatively high cost base. A succession of deals over the past three years has added to the company's office and administrative costs, especially in the US and Far East, where most of the expansion has taken place. </p> <p>'We would have done the cost-cutting anyway,' says Rooney, 'because we had to review the operations we've taken over. It doesn't necessarily mean redundancies, because our budgets included an element of job hirings that may not be appropriate now.' </p> <p>What Rooney is not going to do - at least not until much later in the year - is make any kind of financial forecast. As a major shareholder in Baltimore, he knows, from bitter experience, what that kind of thing might cost him.</p>",

So, for a company supposedly in the doldrums, Baltimore is feeling reasonably optimistic. 'We have to just keep on doing the deals we're doing, and get on with the business,' says Rooney. 'It's been a distraction over the past few weeks, having to reassure the market about prospects, but now we have to carry on with the business.' He sees scope in licensing Baltimore's services to banks and telecoms companies whose web services will be managed by Baltimore - for a substantial fee. In terms of market share, Baltimore is doing well, albeit in a bombed-out market. It recently overtook Entrust as the market leader, and the number one ranking should win it more business. The financial background is encouraging. Even on the reduced first-quarter figures, there is still 150 per cent growth, year on year. After a call on shareholders last year, and even allowing for the expansion spree that has seen 60 per cent of the business coming from outside Europe, the company has \u00a3130m cash in the bank. 'That's enough to keep us going for three years, even if we never make a profit,'adds Rooney. There was once speculation that Microsoft might want to bid for Baltimore, which Rooney sarcastically turned on its head by suggesting that it was just as likely that Baltimore might take over Bill Gates's company. Now his ambitions with the world's leading computer company are more limited, but none the less significant. 'As the internet becomes a day-to-day method of doing business, the next big thing will be the need to authenticate yourself. We are the only company in the world that provides that kind of service, especially in the field of public key infrastructure, and we see a great opportunity to co-operate with Windows 2000 on this.' He is a firm believer in the new economy, but is also a realist. 'The internet is not going away, but the downturn will force people to look at ways of using the internet more efficiently. The priorities will be to build a web presence, and to make it secure. It's in the second part of that where we will benefit. I think we'll see less \"free\" access. The net will become a subscription-based service, which will require authentication. That's our speciality.' The people who walked out of Chief O'Neill's, some of whom still have reservations about the company, will be glad to hear all this, but their immediate concern is to hear how Baltimore will tackle its comparatively high cost base. A succession of deals over the past three years has added to the company's office and administrative costs, especially in the US and Far East, where most of the expansion has taken place. 'We would have done the cost-cutting anyway,' says Rooney, 'because we had to review the operations we've taken over. It doesn't necessarily mean redundancies, because our budgets included an element of job hirings that may not be appropriate now.' What Rooney is not going to do - at least not until much later in the year - is make any kind of financial forecast. As a major shareholder in Baltimore, he knows, from bitter experience, what that kind of thing might cost him.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Supermarket chain Sainsbury's is being accused by nutrition experts of misleading parents with its new Blue Parrot Cafe range of foods targeted at children.</p> <p>The products include everything from fish fingers and curry sauce to fresh fruit and are the result of a massive research programme by the retailer involving children, parents and food experts. But an investigation by the campaign group Focus on Food and The Observer has found that many of the most popular products compare poorly in fat content and price with their standard equivalents.</p> <p>In a randomly selected basket of children's favourites, the poor performers included burgers (less protein and more fat), fish fingers (less protein and more salt and sugar) and mashed potato shapes (twice as much fat).</p> <p>Fresh fruit and vegetables selected and packaged with the Blue Parrot logo were up to three times as expensive as the non-branded equivalents. In one case (organic cherry tomatoes), there was no difference at all bar the price: the children's version was three times as expensive.</p> <p>Focus on Food campaign director Anita Cormac said she was concerned that the range, which promises parents a healthier option for their children, may be misleading. 'I would not say they are hoodwinking parents but I would say it is bamboozling,' she said. 'My concern is that it is not clear unless you look very carefully at the labelling whether or not these convenience foods are more advantageous. I question the whole culture of convenience foods for children.'</p> <p>Lizzie Vann, the woman credited with pioneering organic baby food 10 years ago, said any range targeted at children should be entirely organic. 'One in two babies eat organic food now and the hope is that parents will carry that through to older children. We have to get to the roots of the problem. I question meals which are targeted at children as a whole and I believe that if parents are offered good quality fish or meat while their children get beans and chips on a menu, the parents should eat the children's meals and let them have the good quality adult food.'</p> <p>The Food Commission, which carried out a large study on children's foods last year and revealed high levels of unhealthy sugars, fats and salt, criticised the products in the range which fuel the 'burgers and beans' culture.</p> <p>Our investigation found some products appeared to be healthier than any of the comparable foods. For example, Blue Parrot wafer-thin ham contained 97 per cent pork, higher than the equivalents. Garlic baguettes, beef lasagne and cocktail sausages contained less fat and more protein than the other ranges. Cheese spread contained less protein than the best-known brand equivalent, but it was lower in fat.</p> <p>Sainsbury's said the range had been created after extensive research by its senior nutritionists and was endorsed by the Hyperactive Child Support charity. 'The range covers 180 products and was devised with the concerns of parents in mind,' said a spokesman. 'We consulted 18,000 mums and kids over six months to find out what they wanted. We believe the range offers excellent quality and nutritional value. It is not intended to be just a health food range.'</p> <p>He added that parents said they hated throwing food away, so wanted packaging that allowed for smaller portions, and research showed that not all parents were concerned about the salt or sugar content of their children's food.</p> <p>'We don't believe any other supermarket is offering such a well-researched range of foods for children,' he said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Supermarket chain Sainsbury's is being accused by nutrition experts of misleading parents with its new Blue Parrot Cafe range of foods targeted at children. The products include everything from fish fingers and curry sauce to fresh fruit and are the result of a massive research programme by the retailer involving children, parents and food experts. But an investigation by the campaign group Focus on Food and The Observer has found that many of the most popular products compare poorly in fat content and price with their standard equivalents. In a randomly selected basket of children's favourites, the poor performers included burgers (less protein and more fat), fish fingers (less protein and more salt and sugar) and mashed potato shapes (twice as much fat). Fresh fruit and vegetables selected and packaged with the Blue Parrot logo were up to three times as expensive as the non-branded equivalents. In one case (organic cherry tomatoes), there was no difference at all bar the price: the children's version was three times as expensive. Focus on Food campaign director Anita Cormac said she was concerned that the range, which promises parents a healthier option for their children, may be misleading. 'I would not say they are hoodwinking parents but I would say it is bamboozling,' she said. 'My concern is that it is not clear unless you look very carefully at the labelling whether or not these convenience foods are more advantageous. I question the whole culture of convenience foods for children.' Lizzie Vann, the woman credited with pioneering organic baby food 10 years ago, said any range targeted at children should be entirely organic. 'One in two babies eat organic food now and the hope is that parents will carry that through to older children. We have to get to the roots of the problem. I question meals which are targeted at children as a whole and I believe that if parents are offered good quality fish or meat while their children get beans and chips on a menu, the parents should eat the children's meals and let them have the good quality adult food.' The Food Commission, which carried out a large study on children's foods last year and revealed high levels of unhealthy sugars, fats and salt, criticised the products in the range which fuel the 'burgers and beans' culture. Our investigation found some products appeared to be healthier than any of the comparable foods. For example, Blue Parrot wafer-thin ham contained 97 per cent pork, higher than the equivalents. Garlic baguettes, beef lasagne and cocktail sausages contained less fat and more protein than the other ranges. Cheese spread contained less protein than the best-known brand equivalent, but it was lower in fat. Sainsbury's said the range had been created after extensive research by its senior nutritionists and was endorsed by the Hyperactive Child Support charity. 'The range covers 180 products and was devised with the concerns of parents in mind,' said a spokesman. 'We consulted 18,000 mums and kids over six months to find out what they wanted. We believe the range offers excellent quality and nutritional value. It is not intended to be just a health food range.' He added that parents said they hated throwing food away, so wanted packaging that allowed for smaller portions, and research showed that not all parents were concerned about the salt or sugar content of their children's food. 'We don't believe any other supermarket is offering such a well-researched range of foods for children,' he said.",

      "body": "<p>Please don't be alarmed, but I'm thinking of becoming a devil worshipper. I'm aware that Easter weekend is hardly the most tasteful time to make an announcement like this. It's a bit like declaring one's decision to cease being a vegetarian on a turkey farm the night before Christmas. Thing is, I'm a bit bored with Jesus. It's all getting a bit old (man), and I'm tired of religious bods, like that vicar the other week, slagging off single parents and blaming us for the sins of the universe. I'm starting to think if I shop around a bit, I could come up with a better deal, win myself some incentives- a bit like looking for a mortgage, only this time we're putting my soul up as collateral. That's the way I'm thinking right now. What's more, I seem to be far from alone in my blasphemy. </p> <p>You can tell you're getting old when the atheists start looking young. Crises of faith used to happen as part of one's college course. The realisation that God didn't exist tended to arrive at exactly the same moment as the realisation that hangovers did. These days, we'd be considered slow off the mark. The 'yoof' of today are out there, pigging out on chocolate eggs right this second, and while they could probably name the members of Atomic Kitten and Radiohead without a moment's pause, my bet is they wouldn't know the names of the disciples, or even the gospels, if you threw a Gideon bible at them. Indeed, the son of God currently seems to rank somewhat lower in juvenile awareness than Britney, Ronan, Leonardo, or any other false god one might care to mention. The harsh truth being that, compared to even the most bottom-rung celebrities, Jesus has become very small fry. </p> <p>So, has Jesus lost it? By which I mean has He, the holiest of the holies, the son of the creator, who came down to earth to preach peace and joy, and who suffered and died on the cross for our sins, hit a bit of a career trough? Is Mary's son underperforming? Or, to couch it in terms even the most shallow of people could understand, has the son of God failed to have a 'hit' for some time, and consequently been struck off the great guest list in the sky? It certainly looks like it to me. </p> <p>When I was young, caring about Jesus was just something you did. There was no question about it. If you didn't, you were left in no doubt that, when you died, your soul would be thrown on to a filthy lice-infested skip to be eaten by the wild dogs of hell. (And let's not even get started on the small print of Catholicism.) These days, God and Jesus, the ultimate father-and-son song and dance act, don't seem to have quite the same cachet. There was a time when Jesus Christ was regularly hailed as the first great pop star, the greatest of them all. These days, nobody calls Jesus a pop star any more - almost as if He's not fab enough to be likened to someone as important as a pop star. Indeed, the average young person's definition of eternal damnation seems to be not being allowed to stay up to watch Pop Stars. </p> <p>Admittedly, times change, as do religions, as do regions. My own bout of god-bothering, from the ages of seven to 11, may have been inspired, at least in part, by the fact that I grew up in the country. Everybody believed in God in the provinces in the 70s - there was nothing else to do. Indeed, that's what Jesus had going for him in those days - vast areas of the civilised world were as bored rigid as Middle America is today.

      "bodyText": "Please don't be alarmed, but I'm thinking of becoming a devil worshipper. I'm aware that Easter weekend is hardly the most tasteful time to make an announcement like this. It's a bit like declaring one's decision to cease being a vegetarian on a turkey farm the night before Christmas. Thing is, I'm a bit bored with Jesus. It's all getting a bit old (man), and I'm tired of religious bods, like that vicar the other week, slagging off single parents and blaming us for the sins of the universe. I'm starting to think if I shop around a bit, I could come up with a better deal, win myself some incentives- a bit like looking for a mortgage, only this time we're putting my soul up as collateral. That's the way I'm thinking right now. What's more, I seem to be far from alone in my blasphemy. You can tell you're getting old when the atheists start looking young. Crises of faith used to happen as part of one's college course. The realisation that God didn't exist tended to arrive at exactly the same moment as the realisation that hangovers did. These days, we'd be considered slow off the mark. The 'yoof' of today are out there, pigging out on chocolate eggs right this second, and while they could probably name the members of Atomic Kitten and Radiohead without a moment's pause, my bet is they wouldn't know the names of the disciples, or even the gospels, if you threw a Gideon bible at them. Indeed, the son of God currently seems to rank somewhat lower in juvenile awareness than Britney, Ronan, Leonardo, or any other false god one might care to mention. The harsh truth being that, compared to even the most bottom-rung celebrities, Jesus has become very small fry. So, has Jesus lost it? By which I mean has He, the holiest of the holies, the son of the creator, who came down to earth to preach peace and joy, and who suffered and died on the cross for our sins, hit a bit of a career trough? Is Mary's son underperforming? Or, to couch it in terms even the most shallow of people could understand, has the son of God failed to have a 'hit' for some time, and consequently been struck off the great guest list in the sky? It certainly looks like it to me. When I was young, caring about Jesus was just something you did. There was no question about it. If you didn't, you were left in no doubt that, when you died, your soul would be thrown on to a filthy lice-infested skip to be eaten by the wild dogs of hell. (And let's not even get started on the small print of Catholicism.) These days, God and Jesus, the ultimate father-and-son song and dance act, don't seem to have quite the same cachet. There was a time when Jesus Christ was regularly hailed as the first great pop star, the greatest of them all. These days, nobody calls Jesus a pop star any more - almost as if He's not fab enough to be likened to someone as important as a pop star. Indeed, the average young person's definition of eternal damnation seems to be not being allowed to stay up to watch Pop Stars. Admittedly, times change, as do religions, as do regions. My own bout of god-bothering, from the ages of seven to 11, may have been inspired, at least in part, by the fact that I grew up in the country. Everybody believed in God in the provinces in the 70s - there was nothing else to do. Indeed, that's what Jesus had going for him in those days - vast areas of the civilised world were as bored rigid as Middle America is today. Now that drugs have hit even the sleepiest of our shires, things just aren't the same. What young person would want to sit around thinking about God when, with one pop of a pill, they can actually see Him? Saying that, if you ask me, it was when British homes started getting colour television that Jesus really started to lose His captive UK audience. Celebrity is what screwed up Jesus Christ's demographic. When Christ, Cat Stevens and Uri Geller was all there was, everything was fine.

      "body": "<p>Trade Minister Dick Caborn says 'nothing' all day, and this keeps him very, very busy. Caborn is busy reassuring the nation that nothing in the proposed General Agreement on Trade in Services (Gats) threatens Britain's environmental regulations. Nothing in Gats permits American corporate powers to overturn UK health and safety regulations. Nothing in Gats, which is part of the World Trade Organisation regime, threatens public control of the National Health Service. The official statement of what Gats doesn't do goes on for pages and pages. </p> <p>So I've been perplexed by Caborn and his EU sidekick, Pascal Lamy, rushing to Geneva and Washington and God knows where else to argue over the wording of rules that do nothing, change nothing and mean nothing. </p> <p>But then last week 'something' came through on my fax machine. And this confidential document from the WTO Secretariat, dated 19 March, is something indeed: a plan to create an international agency with veto power over parliamentary and regulatory decisions. </p> <p>When Winston Churchill said that 'democracy is the worst form of government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time' he simply lacked the vision to see that in March 2001, the WTO would design a system to replace democracy with something much better: Article VI.4 of Gats. And this unassuming six-page memo, now modestly hidden away in secrecy, may one day be seen as the post-democratic Magna Carta. </p> <p>It begins by considering the difficult matter of how to punish nations that violate 'a balance between two potentially conflicting priorities: promoting trade expansion versus protecting the regulatory rights of governments'. </p> <p>Think about that. For centuries Britain, and now almost all nations, has relied on elected parliaments, congresses, prime ministers and presidents to set the rules. It is these ungainly deliberative bodies that 'balance' the interests of citizens and businesses </p> <p>Now kiss that obsolete system goodbye. Once Britain and the EU sign the Gats treaty, Article VI.4 of that treaty, the Necessity Test, will kick in. Then, as per the Secretariat's secret programme outlined in the 19 March memo, national parliaments and regulatory agencies will be demoted, in effect, to advisory bodies. </p> <p>Final authority will rest with the Gats Disputes Panel to determine whether a law or regulation is, in the memo's language, 'more burdensome than necessary'. And Gats, not Parliament, will decide what is 'necessary'. </p> <p>As a practical matter, this means nations will have to shape laws protecting the air you breathe, the trains you travel in and the food you chew by picking not the best or safest means for the nation, but the cheapest methods for foreign investors and merchants. </p> <p>Let's get down to concrete examples. The Necessity Test has already had a trial run in North America via inclusion in Nafta, the region's free trade agreement. Recently, the state of California banned a petrol additive, MBTE, which has contaminated water supplies. A Canadian seller of the 'M' chemical in MBTE filed a complaint saying the rule failed the Necessity Test. </p> <p>The Canadians assert that California could simply require all petrol stations to dig up their storage tanks and reseal them - and hire a swarm of inspectors to make sure it's done perfectly. The Canadian proposal might cost Californians a bundle and would be impossible to police. That's just too bad. The Canadian proposal is the least trade-restrictive method for protecting the water supply. 'Least trade-restrictive' is Nafta's Necessity Test. </p> <p>If California does not knuckle under, the US Treasury may have to fork out $976 million in compensation to the Canadians. </p> <p>The Gats' version of the the Necessity Test is Nafta on steroids. Under Gats, as proposed in the memo, national laws and regulations will be struck down if they are 'more burdensome than necessary' to business. Notice the subtle change. Suddenly the Gats treaty is not about trade at all, but a sly means to wipe away restrictions on business and industry, foreign and local. </p> <p>So what 'burdensome' restrictions are sitting in the corporate cross-hairs? The US trade representative has already floated proposals on retail distribution. Want to preserve Britain's green belts? If some trees stand in the way of a Wal-Mart superstore, forget it. Even under the current, weaker, Gats, Japan was forced to tear up its own planning rules to let in the retail monster boxes. </p> <p>The Government assures us that nothing threatens its right to enforce laws in the nation's public interest. Not according to the 19 March memo. The WTO reports that, in the course of the secretive multilateral negotiations, trade ministers agreed that a Gats tribunal would not accept a defence of 'safeguarding the public interest'. </p> <p>In place of a public interest standard, the Secretariat proposes a deliciously Machiavellian 'efficiency principle': 'It may well be politically more acceptable to countries to accept international obligations which give primacy to economic efficiency.' This is an unsubtle invitation to load the Gats with requirements that rulers know their democratic parliaments could not otherwise accept. This would be supremely dangerous if, one day, the US elected a president who wanted to shred air pollution rules or, say, Britain elected a prime minister who had a mad desire to sell off the rest of his nation's air traffic control system. </p> <p>How convenient for embattled chief executives. What elected congresses and parliaments dare not do, Gats would require. Under the post-democratic Gats regime, the Disputes Panel, those Grand Inquisitors of the free market, will decide whether a nation's law or a regulation serves what the memo calls a 'legitimate objective'. </p> <p>While parliaments are lumbered with dated constitutional requirements to debate a law's legitimacy in public, with public evidence, and hearings open to citizen comment, Gats panels are far more efficient. Hearings are closed. Unions, as well as consumer, environmental and human rights groups, are barred from participating - or even knowing what is said before the panel. </p> <p>Is the 19 March memo just a bit of wool-gathering by the WTO Secretariat? Hardly. The WTO was working from the proposals suggested in yet another confidential document also sent to me by my good friend, Unnamable Source.

      "bodyText": "Trade Minister Dick Caborn says 'nothing' all day, and this keeps him very, very busy. Caborn is busy reassuring the nation that nothing in the proposed General Agreement on Trade in Services (Gats) threatens Britain's environmental regulations. Nothing in Gats permits American corporate powers to overturn UK health and safety regulations. Nothing in Gats, which is part of the World Trade Organisation regime, threatens public control of the National Health Service. The official statement of what Gats doesn't do goes on for pages and pages. So I've been perplexed by Caborn and his EU sidekick, Pascal Lamy, rushing to Geneva and Washington and God knows where else to argue over the wording of rules that do nothing, change nothing and mean nothing. But then last week 'something' came through on my fax machine. And this confidential document from the WTO Secretariat, dated 19 March, is something indeed: a plan to create an international agency with veto power over parliamentary and regulatory decisions. When Winston Churchill said that 'democracy is the worst form of government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time' he simply lacked the vision to see that in March 2001, the WTO would design a system to replace democracy with something much better: Article VI.4 of Gats. And this unassuming six-page memo, now modestly hidden away in secrecy, may one day be seen as the post-democratic Magna Carta. It begins by considering the difficult matter of how to punish nations that violate 'a balance between two potentially conflicting priorities: promoting trade expansion versus protecting the regulatory rights of governments'. Think about that. For centuries Britain, and now almost all nations, has relied on elected parliaments, congresses, prime ministers and presidents to set the rules. It is these ungainly deliberative bodies that 'balance' the interests of citizens and businesses Now kiss that obsolete system goodbye. Once Britain and the EU sign the Gats treaty, Article VI.4 of that treaty, the Necessity Test, will kick in. Then, as per the Secretariat's secret programme outlined in the 19 March memo, national parliaments and regulatory agencies will be demoted, in effect, to advisory bodies. Final authority will rest with the Gats Disputes Panel to determine whether a law or regulation is, in the memo's language, 'more burdensome than necessary'. And Gats, not Parliament, will decide what is 'necessary'. As a practical matter, this means nations will have to shape laws protecting the air you breathe, the trains you travel in and the food you chew by picking not the best or safest means for the nation, but the cheapest methods for foreign investors and merchants. Let's get down to concrete examples. The Necessity Test has already had a trial run in North America via inclusion in Nafta, the region's free trade agreement. Recently, the state of California banned a petrol additive, MBTE, which has contaminated water supplies. A Canadian seller of the 'M' chemical in MBTE filed a complaint saying the rule failed the Necessity Test. The Canadians assert that California could simply require all petrol stations to dig up their storage tanks and reseal them - and hire a swarm of inspectors to make sure it's done perfectly. The Canadian proposal might cost Californians a bundle and would be impossible to police. That's just too bad. The Canadian proposal is the least trade-restrictive method for protecting the water supply. 'Least trade-restrictive' is Nafta's Necessity Test. If California does not knuckle under, the US Treasury may have to fork out $976 million in compensation to the Canadians. The Gats' version of the the Necessity Test is Nafta on steroids. Under Gats, as proposed in the memo, national laws and regulations will be struck down if they are 'more burdensome than necessary' to business. Notice the subtle change. Suddenly the Gats treaty is not about trade at all, but a sly means to wipe away restrictions on business and industry, foreign and local. So what 'burdensome' restrictions are sitting in the corporate cross-hairs? The US trade representative has already floated proposals on retail distribution. Want to preserve Britain's green belts? If some trees stand in the way of a Wal-Mart superstore, forget it. Even under the current, weaker, Gats, Japan was forced to tear up its own planning rules to let in the retail monster boxes. The Government assures us that nothing threatens its right to enforce laws in the nation's public interest. Not according to the 19 March memo. The WTO reports that, in the course of the secretive multilateral negotiations, trade ministers agreed that a Gats tribunal would not accept a defence of 'safeguarding the public interest'. In place of a public interest standard, the Secretariat proposes a deliciously Machiavellian 'efficiency principle': 'It may well be politically more acceptable to countries to accept international obligations which give primacy to economic efficiency.' This is an unsubtle invitation to load the Gats with requirements that rulers know their democratic parliaments could not otherwise accept. This would be supremely dangerous if, one day, the US elected a president who wanted to shred air pollution rules or, say, Britain elected a prime minister who had a mad desire to sell off the rest of his nation's air traffic control system. How convenient for embattled chief executives. What elected congresses and parliaments dare not do, Gats would require. Under the post-democratic Gats regime, the Disputes Panel, those Grand Inquisitors of the free market, will decide whether a nation's law or a regulation serves what the memo calls a 'legitimate objective'. While parliaments are lumbered with dated constitutional requirements to debate a law's legitimacy in public, with public evidence, and hearings open to citizen comment, Gats panels are far more efficient. Hearings are closed. Unions, as well as consumer, environmental and human rights groups, are barred from participating - or even knowing what is said before the panel. Is the 19 March memo just a bit of wool-gathering by the WTO Secretariat? Hardly. The WTO was working from the proposals suggested in yet another confidential document also sent to me by my good friend, Unnamable Source. The secret memo, 'Domestic Regulation: Necessity and Transparency', dated 24 February, was drafted by the European Commission's own 'working party', in which the UK ministry claims a leading role. In a letter to MPs, Trade Minister Caborn swears that, through the EC working party, he will ensure that Gats recognises the 'sovereign right of government to regulate services' to meet 'national policy objectives'. Yet the 24 February memo, representing the UK's official (though hidden) proposals, rejects a nation's right to remove its rules from Gats jurisdiction once a service industry is joined to the treaty. Indeed, the EC document contains contemptuous attacks on nations claiming 'legitimate objectives' as potential 'disguised barriers' to trade liberalisation. Moreover, there is a codicil that regulation must not be 'more trade restrictive than necessary', ready for harvesting by the WTO Secretariat's free market fanatics. Not knowing I had these documents in hand, Caborn's office this week maintained that Gats permitted nations a 'right to regulate to meet national policy objectives'. I was not permitted to question the Trade Minister himself. However, the Caborn letter to MPs admits that his pleasant interpretation of Gats has not been 'tested in WTO jurisprudence'. This is, after all, the Minister who, with his EU counterparts, just lost a $194 million judgment to the US over the sale of bananas. Now, I can understand how Caborn goofed that one. Europe argued that bananas were a product, but the US successfully proved that bananas were a service - try not to think about that - and therefore fall under Gats. And that illustrates the key issue. No one in Britain should bother with what Caborn thinks. The only thing that counts is what George W Bush thinks. Or, at least, what the people who think for Bush think. Presumably, Caborn won't sue the UK for violating the treaty. But the US may. In a way it already has. Forget Caborn's assurance - we need assurance from President Bush that he won't use Gats to help out Wal-Mart - or Citibank or Chevron Oil. The odd thing is, despite getting serviced in the bananas case, Caborn and the Blair government have not demanded explicit language barring commerce-first decisions by a Gats panel. Instead, the secret 14 February EC paper encourages the WTO's Secretariat to use the punitive form of the Necessity Test sought by the US. So there you have it. Rather than attack the rules by which America whipped Europe, Caborn and the EC are effectively handing George Bush a bigger whip. gregory.palast@observer.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>It is a social error of the grossest kind to confuse the Lord Chamberlain and the Lord Great Chamberlain. Penny Russell-Smith, the Queen's PR, strongly implied that the distinction must be grasped by all who wished to shine at the best garden parties. The Lord Chamberlain was not 'that chap in tights who walks backwards at the state opening of Parliament,' as I had foolishly thought. 'No, no, no, no!' she cried. 'That's the Lord Great Chamberlain. The Lord Chamberlain appears at state banquets, not the procession to Parliament.'</p> <p>The Lord Great Chamberlain has Her Majesty's gracious permission to sling a ceremonial key from his belt. He may also have the right to claim the bed slept in by the monarch on the night before a coronation - the authorities conflict on this point. The present Lord Great Chamberlain is seventh Marquess of Cholmondeley (pronounced 'Chumley'). The Chumleys were in an ancient and ugly scrap with the Earls of Ancaster and the Marquesses of Lincolnshire (both pronounced as you'd expect) over who should hold the title until 1902, when the contesting families agreed they should take turns to fill the hereditary office, reign by reign.</p> <p>The Chumleys didn't know it at the time, but the power-sharing compromise - a Good Friday Agreement for the English aristocracy - was a great bargain. The lottery of biology gave them Elizabeth Windsor, whose reign began in 1952 and shows no signs of stopping. A noble personage connected to the last of the Ancasters or Lincolnshires - the titles are extinct, as I'm sure you know - will be left with the inevitably short reign of an aged Charles III as a consolation prize. The Guardian and Independent say Lord Carrington could be that personage, but my mind had been boggled by Lord Great Chamberlains by the time I dug out their reports and I had lost the will to fact check.</p> <p>I did find that the completely separate Lord Chamberlain is Richard Luce. He has an ornate key of his very own, but must keep it in his hip pocket. He is 'the Firm's' chief executive officer, who vets candidates for Palace jobs and is the chairman of monthly board meetings of royal department heads. Lord Luce was appointed by and is answerable to the Queen, and it must be his duty as a courtier to work to keep the office of head of state as the irrevocable freehold of a clan of reactionary billionaires; to ensure that there is a Charles III. The most slack-jawed monarchist would find it hard to argue he has the fierce independence necessary to produce a rigorous review of royal conduct.</p> <p>Buckingham Palace has argued just that. Sophie Wessex's bletherings demanded that something must be done. The Palace responded by saying Luce would hold an inquiry into how royals should behave in the business world. His career as a courtier is not the only handicap he must struggle to overcome as he tries to draw up rules for an open, modern monarchy.

      "bodyText": "It is a social error of the grossest kind to confuse the Lord Chamberlain and the Lord Great Chamberlain. Penny Russell-Smith, the Queen's PR, strongly implied that the distinction must be grasped by all who wished to shine at the best garden parties. The Lord Chamberlain was not 'that chap in tights who walks backwards at the state opening of Parliament,' as I had foolishly thought. 'No, no, no, no!' she cried. 'That's the Lord Great Chamberlain. The Lord Chamberlain appears at state banquets, not the procession to Parliament.' The Lord Great Chamberlain has Her Majesty's gracious permission to sling a ceremonial key from his belt. He may also have the right to claim the bed slept in by the monarch on the night before a coronation - the authorities conflict on this point. The present Lord Great Chamberlain is seventh Marquess of Cholmondeley (pronounced 'Chumley'). The Chumleys were in an ancient and ugly scrap with the Earls of Ancaster and the Marquesses of Lincolnshire (both pronounced as you'd expect) over who should hold the title until 1902, when the contesting families agreed they should take turns to fill the hereditary office, reign by reign. The Chumleys didn't know it at the time, but the power-sharing compromise - a Good Friday Agreement for the English aristocracy - was a great bargain. The lottery of biology gave them Elizabeth Windsor, whose reign began in 1952 and shows no signs of stopping. A noble personage connected to the last of the Ancasters or Lincolnshires - the titles are extinct, as I'm sure you know - will be left with the inevitably short reign of an aged Charles III as a consolation prize. The Guardian and Independent say Lord Carrington could be that personage, but my mind had been boggled by Lord Great Chamberlains by the time I dug out their reports and I had lost the will to fact check. I did find that the completely separate Lord Chamberlain is Richard Luce. He has an ornate key of his very own, but must keep it in his hip pocket. He is 'the Firm's' chief executive officer, who vets candidates for Palace jobs and is the chairman of monthly board meetings of royal department heads. Lord Luce was appointed by and is answerable to the Queen, and it must be his duty as a courtier to work to keep the office of head of state as the irrevocable freehold of a clan of reactionary billionaires; to ensure that there is a Charles III. The most slack-jawed monarchist would find it hard to argue he has the fierce independence necessary to produce a rigorous review of royal conduct. Buckingham Palace has argued just that. Sophie Wessex's bletherings demanded that something must be done. The Palace responded by saying Luce would hold an inquiry into how royals should behave in the business world. His career as a courtier is not the only handicap he must struggle to overcome as he tries to draw up rules for an open, modern monarchy. I can't, for example, see how he can be anything but pleased by the Wessex girl's sighs that an ignorant public had failed to see the statesmanly qualities of Willie Hague, or by her weird portrayal of Gordon Brown as a blood-sucking Bolshevik. Luce was a Tory MP from 1971 to 1992. If he is a true monarchist as well as a loyal Conservative, he should also find it difficult to condemn her PR firm's exploitation of royal connections. Monarchy is the exploitation of connections. If you don't have a blood connection to the House of Windsor you can never be head of state, however wise or popular you may be. In one respect, however, Luce is well-qualified for the job. His career has been a preparation for the moment when he would be called to play one of the Establishment's finest gambits: the incurious inquiry. After Margaret Thatcher came to power in 1979, Luce became the Minister of State in the Foreign Office responsible for the Falkland Islands. (He served under the Foreign Secretary, Lord Carrington, who may yet be the next Lord Great Chamberlain.) The FO dismissed the belligerent noises coming from the Argentine military junta as typical Latin machismo.

Their departures are remembered as honourable political acts. Successive Foreign Office Ministers had suggested to the Argentines that Britain was prepared to share the sovereignty of the Falklands. It wasn't a ludicrous policy then, and is a sensible one today, now that Argentina is a stable democracy. For all their other failings, Luce and Carrington didn't convince the Argentines that Britain had no interest in defending the islands by announcing that the survey ship Endurance would be withdrawn from the South Atlantic - the news came from the Ministry of Defence. Nor did they persuade Argentina that Britain cared so little for the islanders it would force them to accept second-class British citizenship - that was the Home Office. They could scarcely be blamed for the incompetence of the intelligence services which weren't able to tell the Cabinet if enemy forces were going to invade until six hours after they had landed. Their self-sacrifice protected many backs - including the exposed back of Margaret Thatcher. In February 1983 Luce was reappointed to his old job in the Foreign Office.

Meet the latest phenomenon behind a surge in crime: lone teenage girls working with a pack of young men. A new breed of street gang, composed of teenage boys with a single female member, has been identified by criminologists after it swept across the United States to become increasingly apparent here. Delinquent young females are rejecting the notion of 'girl power' and with it the support of members of their own sex. Instead, they seek membership of male gangs by showing they are equally capable of violence and aggression. Once accepted, the girls often become hostile to all other females. In extreme cases, criminologists believe the presence of a single female member can boost the levels of violence within the gang as a whole, and point out that in the past year a number of notorious crimes have been commited by groups of offenders matching this profile. Last week detectives investigating the murder of a man who was kicked and punched to death charged eight teenage boys and a 16-year-old girl with violent disorder in relation to the killing. The man was set upon in London last summer after going to the aid of his friend who was being robbed. Criminologist Dr Jody Miller is the author of One Of The Guys, a new book published after a five-year study into the involvement of young women in street gangs in Britain and America.

During the past decade the number of women sentenced for violent crimes has more than doubled and the rate of increase shows no signs of slowing down. In 1985 violence against the person accounted for only 3 per cent of recorded crime committed by girls under 14. This has now jumped to 9 per cent, almost equal to the figure for teenage boys. The fact that women are drinking more than before is also seen as a factor, especially as alcohol contributes to more than 80 per cent of violent crimes. The problem has become so acute that Holloway Prison has introduced an anger-management course for the 40 females aged between 15 and 20 who are held in its recently opened D-Zero young offenders' unit in a bid to reduce levels of violence. Last week a 17-year-old girl was convicted of pimping after a week-long trial at Reading Crown Court.

'We wanted to make each moment fluid, so it's a coherent piece,' said Mark Fisher, the show's designer and the man behind the acclaimed Dome show. 'It has its own narrative, not like Cirque du Soleil or De La Guarda, which were really just a series of tableaux.' Fisher, whose reputation rests on the large touring shows he designed for Pink Floyd, the Rolling Stones and U2, has worked on what he describes as 'a shoestring' to bring his Storm to life. 'We have developed the show inside one of two big industrial spaces at The Circus Space, a former power station in East London and we have tried to change the ambience of this functional space with lights.' Of the cast of 26, 20 are Dome performers who were trained from scratch over two and half years by Paul Cockle, the manager of the Storm show. 'This time we have a very street look, rather than a carnival look,' said Fisher. 'It is slightly pastiche and yet raw and in your face at the same time.' Fisher is not sure why Britain has taken so long to come up with a modern circus show. 'The performing arts here have been dominated by the Royal Shakespeare Company axis and the traditional West End musical,' he said. After a month in London, the show will tour Manchester, Glasgow, Newcastle and Henley, before returning for a second London season and a planned European tour. Tickets: Wed, Thu, Fri \u00a315; Tue \u00a312.50; Sat \u00a317.50 (concessions available). Box Office: 020-7316 4740",

After an initially bungled inquiry into the Dickinson killing, Montez's name was added to a list of itinerant workers in Brittany at the time.</p> <p>Police here said that inquiries on possible further assaults would be widened as the suspect was known to have lived in Britain and Germany before travelling to the United States.</p>",

Miami police are holding Francisco Arce Montez, 51, who is due to appear in court on 2 July on a charge of 'lewd and lascivious' conduct after breaking into a woman's beach apartment last month and allegedly masturbating while she slept. The offence has also been linked to the earlier intrusion by a man into another Miami beach apartment occupied by four Irish girls and two other women backpackers. A connection between the Miami case and the Pleine-Foug\u00e8res murder on 18 July 1996 followed a check by a US immigration official who had read about the murder while on holiday in Britain. Montez's name was among 48 suspects wanted by the French for questioning. Suspicions were strengthened by reports of a case two years before Caroline's death when a man, identified as Montez, was arrested after twice entering a youth hostel at Bl\u00e9r\u00e9 in the Loire when he tried to lure a young Scottish girl into his car. After an initially bungled inquiry into the Dickinson killing, Montez's name was added to a list of itinerant workers in Brittany at the time. Police here said that inquiries on possible further assaults would be widened as the suspect was known to have lived in Britain and Germany before travelling to the United States.",

Now a bitter row has broken out over his corpse.</p> <p>This week a massive expedition of top international climbers will risk their lives to scour a ridge high on Everest in an attempt to locate the young mountaineer's remains - 77 years after he and his climbing partner George Mallory disappeared only 600 feet short of the world's highest summit.</p> <p>Two years ago the same team found Mallory's corpse. Now they are confident of finding Irvine's. If they do they could solve one of the greatest of mountaineering mysteries: did the pair climb Everest nearly three decades before Sir Edmund Hilary and Tenzing Norgay made their historic 1953 ascent?</p> <p>But the expedition is deeply controversial. It has been opposed by Irvine's living relatives and many of Britain's mountaineering \u00e9lite. They have told the climbers, who are led by veteran American guide Eric Simonson, that they would prefer the young mountaineer's body 'to be left where it has lain in peace'.

      "bodyText": "Scholars, historians and armchair mountaineers have long argued over the legend surrounding the death Everest pioneer Andrew 'Sandy' Irvine. Now a bitter row has broken out over his corpse. This week a massive expedition of top international climbers will risk their lives to scour a ridge high on Everest in an attempt to locate the young mountaineer's remains - 77 years after he and his climbing partner George Mallory disappeared only 600 feet short of the world's highest summit. Two years ago the same team found Mallory's corpse. Now they are confident of finding Irvine's. If they do they could solve one of the greatest of mountaineering mysteries: did the pair climb Everest nearly three decades before Sir Edmund Hilary and Tenzing Norgay made their historic 1953 ascent? But the expedition is deeply controversial. It has been opposed by Irvine's living relatives and many of Britain's mountaineering \u00e9lite. They have told the climbers, who are led by veteran American guide Eric Simonson, that they would prefer the young mountaineer's body 'to be left where it has lain in peace'. Simonson has accused the family of greed and of conducting a libellous smear campaign. The stakes are high. Pictures of Irvine's body would be worth a fortune. And the climber, who was 22 when he died, was carrying a tiny Kodak 'Vestpocket' camera containing film that, given the intense preserving cold of extreme altitude, Kodak believe could still be developed. Photographs taken by Simonson's team of the half-naked body of Mallory were sold around the world for huge sums. Pictures from the climbers' long-lost camera - particularly if they conclusively proved that the pair were successful - would be worth far more. In a letter to Simonson John Irvine, the nephew of the dead climber, said that the family has legal ownership of the camera and any film. He told The Observer last week that the family wanted any profits made from finding the corpse to be given to a charitable foundation set up in the Everest pioneer's name. 'We are saying we would much rather you left Sandy Irvine alone but if you have to then please behave in a sensitive way and not disinter him and flash pictures around the world. [Two years ago] Simonson was rather silly and [allowed] pictures of Mallory to be sent around the world which was very distressing for the family. We don't want that to happen.' The family are backed by the \u00e9lite of British climbing.

Mallory's grandson, George Mallory II, told reporters that the sale had made him 'bloody angry'. This weekend Sir Chris Bonington said he was 'appalled' by Simonson's actions.

Bonington said that in the past he had been given pictures of dead climbers on Everest who had been found and photographed by subsequent expeditions and had passed them on to family members. 'That is the act of responsible mountaineers. Simonson is totally wrong.' The Alpine Club - one of the oldest and most respected mountaineering bodies in the world - has taken the unprecedented step of issuing an appeal to Simonson's team. In it Doug Scott, the president of the club and one of Britain's most experienced high altitude mountaineers, accuses Simonson and his team of damaging Mallory's body when searching for artefacts.

He has completed more than a dozen albums and had some 300 pieces of music published. His music has been used on American shows such as ER and Friends, as well as here and in other countries. He now wants to invest wisely the money he is collecting in royalties. </p> <p>His life could have turned out very differently. Although he has always loved music, his parents had discouraged him from thinking of it as an occupation. He explains: 'My father was a musician and ran a steel band, but he went through some difficult times and often had to take other jobs to fill in. I don't think he wanted me to have those money worries.' </p> <p>That was why Mark originally planned to become an optician. But he couldn't get on to the university course he wanted and it wasn't long before he dropped out and got a job as a litigation clerk for a credit company. He worked there for five years. </p> <p>All this time he had been playing music in his spare time and in 1986 he took the bold step of giving up his day job to become a professional musician. He hasn't looked back since. In 1993, he started concentrating on writing music and has seen his income grow to its current level as his royalties have built up. </p> <p>However, he realises it is possible that his income could go down again. This is why he feels he should be prudent and save money for the future. </p> <p>On the advice of his accountant, he channels his income through his own limited company, Shiny Music. The company pays dividends to himself and his wife Sharon, who is also a shareholder in the company. Sharon is a health visitor but is currently doing research for her master's degree. In recent years much of the couple's income has been spent on holidays, a new car, and improvements to their home, which they bought five years ago. </p> <p>They are repaying their home loan with an endowment mortgage, although they have received a letter from their endowment company, Legal &amp; General, telling them the policy may not cover the loan. However, Mark says he is not too worried about this at the moment and has decided to defer dealing with it until they move to a bigger property in three or four years. </p> <p>So far Mark has not man aged to save much and he is only paying \u00a350 a month towards a pension. He would now like to start saving more seriously and he and his wife recently opened a mini cash Isa for \u00a33,000 each with Smile. </p> <p>The couple have two children, Elliot, seven and Corinna, five. He hopes they will go on to university and recently set up friendly society plans into which their child benefit is paid.</p> <p><strong>Adviser 1: Ian Howe</strong></p> <p>Mark's first priority should be to protect his financial health against illness, loss of income and even premature death. An income protection policy could be purchased in case of protracted illness. Mark has some life assurance but does need to ensure that he and Sharon have enough protection for the family's lifestyle to be kept should one of them die early. </p> <p>With their uncertain, yet currently buoyant, financial situation, a flexible mortgage may be a good option. Intelligent Finance (IF) offers one which could fit bill. The rate is less than their present lender's variable rate, so if they kept their payments the same, they would effectively be paying off their loan early, making up for the potential endowment shortfall. If, in addition, Mark saved for future tax bills in an IF savings account, this amount could be offset against the loan, reducing the interest even further.</p> <p>Saving \u00a350 a month into a pension at age 38 simply isn't enough. Mark should consider taking advantage of the new stakeholder pensions.</p> <p>But the problem with pensions is that you can't get at your savings until you're 50. So Mark and Sharon should consider saving the maximum into an Isa. They could each put \u00a3583 a month into an equity-linked Isa over the next five to 10 years. </p> <p>Ian Howe works for financial adviser Towry Law Financial Services.</p> <p><strong>Adviser 2: Gordon Wilson </strong></p> <p>Mark has done well in managing his financial affairs so far. However, he does appear exposed in the event of illness or death. An income protection policy should be considered, and critical illness cover could also be looked at. As a minimum, the mortgage debt should be covered. </p> <p>He needs to review his life assurance. Family income benefit provides high levels of initial cover at low cost and would pay out a guaranteed income on death. Alternatively, term assurance or whole-of-life assurance could be taken out to provide a lump sum.</p> <p>Mark should not let the endowment situation run on. I would deal with the position immediately. This could involve converting part of the mortgage to repayment, reducing the debt or making savings into an Isa.</p> <p>With a move to a larger house planned, I would recommend maintaining quite a liquid position so that Mark and Sharon's options are kept open. Mini cash Isas could absorb \u00a36,000 of their savings a year.</p> <p>With the introduction of stakeholder pensions, this is an opportune time to review his pension strategy. He could be paid a large salary this year: this would increase his ability to contribute and would be the basis year for five years of pension contributions.</p> <p>Gordon Wilson works for financial adviser Thomson &amp; Shepherd. </p> <p>\u0095 Advice is for guidance only.

      "bodyText": "Mark Cherrie Age 38 Lives in North-west London Occupation Musician and music writer Earns About \u00a352,000 Mortgage \u00a368,000 Debts None Investments \u00a33,000 in cash Isa Pension Personal pension Aims To invest more for the future Mark writes music for television and has had considerable success. He has completed more than a dozen albums and had some 300 pieces of music published. His music has been used on American shows such as ER and Friends, as well as here and in other countries. He now wants to invest wisely the money he is collecting in royalties. His life could have turned out very differently. Although he has always loved music, his parents had discouraged him from thinking of it as an occupation. He explains: 'My father was a musician and ran a steel band, but he went through some difficult times and often had to take other jobs to fill in. I don't think he wanted me to have those money worries.' That was why Mark originally planned to become an optician. But he couldn't get on to the university course he wanted and it wasn't long before he dropped out and got a job as a litigation clerk for a credit company. He worked there for five years. All this time he had been playing music in his spare time and in 1986 he took the bold step of giving up his day job to become a professional musician. He hasn't looked back since. In 1993, he started concentrating on writing music and has seen his income grow to its current level as his royalties have built up. However, he realises it is possible that his income could go down again. This is why he feels he should be prudent and save money for the future. On the advice of his accountant, he channels his income through his own limited company, Shiny Music. The company pays dividends to himself and his wife Sharon, who is also a shareholder in the company. Sharon is a health visitor but is currently doing research for her master's degree. In recent years much of the couple's income has been spent on holidays, a new car, and improvements to their home, which they bought five years ago. They are repaying their home loan with an endowment mortgage, although they have received a letter from their endowment company, Legal &amp; General, telling them the policy may not cover the loan. However, Mark says he is not too worried about this at the moment and has decided to defer dealing with it until they move to a bigger property in three or four years. So far Mark has not man aged to save much and he is only paying \u00a350 a month towards a pension. He would now like to start saving more seriously and he and his wife recently opened a mini cash Isa for \u00a33,000 each with Smile. The couple have two children, Elliot, seven and Corinna, five. He hopes they will go on to university and recently set up friendly society plans into which their child benefit is paid. Adviser 1: Ian Howe Mark's first priority should be to protect his financial health against illness, loss of income and even premature death. An income protection policy could be purchased in case of protracted illness. Mark has some life assurance but does need to ensure that he and Sharon have enough protection for the family's lifestyle to be kept should one of them die early. With their uncertain, yet currently buoyant, financial situation, a flexible mortgage may be a good option. Intelligent Finance (IF) offers one which could fit bill. The rate is less than their present lender's variable rate, so if they kept their payments the same, they would effectively be paying off their loan early, making up for the potential endowment shortfall. If, in addition, Mark saved for future tax bills in an IF savings account, this amount could be offset against the loan, reducing the interest even further. Saving \u00a350 a month into a pension at age 38 simply isn't enough. Mark should consider taking advantage of the new stakeholder pensions. But the problem with pensions is that you can't get at your savings until you're 50. So Mark and Sharon should consider saving the maximum into an Isa. They could each put \u00a3583 a month into an equity-linked Isa over the next five to 10 years. Ian Howe works for financial adviser Towry Law Financial Services. Adviser 2: Gordon Wilson Mark has done well in managing his financial affairs so far. However, he does appear exposed in the event of illness or death. An income protection policy should be considered, and critical illness cover could also be looked at. As a minimum, the mortgage debt should be covered. He needs to review his life assurance. Family income benefit provides high levels of initial cover at low cost and would pay out a guaranteed income on death. Alternatively, term assurance or whole-of-life assurance could be taken out to provide a lump sum. Mark should not let the endowment situation run on. I would deal with the position immediately. This could involve converting part of the mortgage to repayment, reducing the debt or making savings into an Isa. With a move to a larger house planned, I would recommend maintaining quite a liquid position so that Mark and Sharon's options are kept open. Mini cash Isas could absorb \u00a36,000 of their savings a year. With the introduction of stakeholder pensions, this is an opportune time to review his pension strategy. He could be paid a large salary this year: this would increase his ability to contribute and would be the basis year for five years of pension contributions. Gordon Wilson works for financial adviser Thomson &amp; Shepherd. \u0095 Advice is for guidance only. Do you want to appear in Wealthcheck?

We could also arrange for the points to be given to a charity, though this hasn't arisen yet,' says a company spokesman. Other companies claim that they try to take a sensitive approach to this issue. 'As long as the legal representative for the estate gets in touch with us, it is a simple procedure,' says a spokesman for Sainsbury's, adding: 'People don't tend to request it.' The arrangement with credit card loyalty schemes is more complicated, since would-be beneficiaries may find that there are credit card debts that need to be paid off first. In practice, many credit card accounts are taken over (together with loyalty points) by a remaining spouse or partner, who may already have been a second cardholder. David Owen says it took five months for his father's Air Miles to be correctly credited to his existing account, after the company inadvertently tried to transfer them into a new account. The process required several letters to sort out. In the end, however, his son did get his free flight to Germany.",

      "body": "<p>Many shoppers who sign up for an interest-free deal are caught out by the small print. The deal they agree to is that no interest will be paid as long as the entire balance is paid off by a certain date. But paying it off is not as easy as it sounds. </p> <p>Customers have found that when they try to pay, the finance firm asks for payment by cheque.</p> <p>In some cases the cheque is then lost or delayed - and the finance firms insist on claiming huge amounts of interest according to the let ter of the contract. Some contracts even have small print saying that payment must reach the company five days before the deadline.</p> <p>The National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux is so concerned it has issued a warning to consumers to ask for the final deadline before they sign the deal and to find out how the payment must be made.</p> <p>The Finance and Leasing Association is also troubled by the growing number of people caught in this situation. It has issued new guide lines to lenders saying reminders should be sent out a month before the deadline and that leeway must be given if a payment is a little late.</p> <p>Clerical assistant Jenny Justice (above) bought a television for \u00a3379 from Powerhouse in Southampton on six months' interest-free credit last June, paying a deposit of \u00a350. The balance had to be paid in full by 17 December.</p> <p>Jenny has had similar deals in the past and has always paid up on time. In her case if the balance was not paid off by that date, the deal would no longer be interest-free. She would then be switched to an interest-bearing deal over three-and-a-half years. When Jenny signed the deal she had to fill out direct debit forms.</p> <p>That was so that if she did not make the 17 December deadline, the company would start taking direct debits each month. In the first week of December, Jenny realised she had not been sent instructions as to how to pay off the balance.</p> <p>She phoned the finance company First National Tricity, owned by Abbey National Bank, and was told to send a cheque. Jenny posted this cheque on 9 December.</p> <p>She did not check her bank statements until mid-January and discovered that the finance company had taken two direct debit payments of \u00a316.57 - as well as cashing her cheque for the full \u00a3329.</p> <p>Jenny, of Romsey, Hampshire, said: 'I phoned them to point out the error, expecting the whole thing to be very quickly sorted out. Instead, they insisted that I had not paid off the amount on time. They claimed my cheque had not arrived with them until 27 December. They said the cheque was cashed on 29 December.'</p> <p>This meant Jenny was no longer on an interest-free deal. Instead, she would have to pay the \u00a316.57 every month for 42 months until the balance was paid off.</p> <p>That is at an APR (annual percentage rate) of 34.2 per cent. In total, she would have to pay \u00a3695.44. Her cheque for \u00a3329 would be counted towards the final sum.</p> <p>Jenny was told her best bet was to agree a settlement figure, which meant she would pay some but not all of the interest. She was sent a proposed settlement fee. First National Tricity were offering to end the agreement for a payment of \u00a3104.84. It claimed she owed \u00a3227.97. That included \u00a3189.10 interest and \u00a338.87 for insurance. Jenny claims she told the sales assistant she did not want insurance, but says that the assistant filled in the paperwork.</p> <p>Jenny said: 'I rang again to query this. I was told during the conversation that I could pay the settlement figure by Switch. So why did they not suggest that when I first phoned them? If they had suggested I pay by Switch then this would never have happened.'</p> <p>We put Jenny's questions to First National Tricity, which said: 'Cheque payment is the method preferred by the company. If a customer inquires about other methods of payment our customer service staff will always offer options.</p> <p>'During December 2000 we were aware of delays to the post that resulted in customers' cheques not reaching their accounts within the deferred period. A company decision was therefore made to allow extra days' grace on customers' accounts.</p> <p>'We fully accept Mrs Justice intended to settle her account before the due date and all interest charges have been removed.'</p> <p>NACAB is dealing with seven other cases of people who have been caught out in the same way. But they say this is 'the tip of the iceberg'.</p> <p>A spokeswoman said these are just the cases reported to head office, but there will be many more dealt with at branch level, and many more again not reported to the CAB.</p> <p>She said: 'The problem these companies have got with 0 per cent finance deals, is - what happens if everyone pays up on time?</p> <p>'The companies tend to be very fussy about payment dates and that is where many people run into difficulties.</p> <p>NACAB has produced a checklist for shoppers:</p> <p>\u0095 Do not let a sales assistant fill in the application for you.</p> <p>\u0095 Take time to understand the offer.</p> <p>\u0095 Make sure you know the final deadline for payment.</p> <p>\u0095 Ask how payment can be made.</p> <p>\u0095 If a direct debit is set up, check the account regularly to see what transactions have been made.</p> <p>\u0095 Check that what you are told by sales staff is written down in the agreement.</p> <p>\u0095 When you are told about credit terms, ask the assistant to point out where they appear in the agreement.</p> <p><strong>Storing up trouble for the future</strong></p> <p>Shoppers paying for goods on store card credit may be paying interest as high as 32 per cent - nearly six times the bank base rate, writes Maria Scott . </p> <p>Store cards are notoriously expensive for people who rack up debt. The rates rarely change and even now, with the base rate at 5.5 per cent, lenders show little sign of budging. There are some cheaper cards in the market (see table) but generally store cards are one of the most expensive ways to borrow. Some shave off a percentage point or so for payment by direct debit, but borrowers who pay off just the minimum pay huge charges.</p> <p>Retailers promote store cards with discounts and other offers. Borrowers canny enough to use the cards for the perks may find them worthwhile since they do not charge annual fees and can provide up to two months' free credit. But borrow long term and you pay up to three times what you would on conventional credit cards.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Timecard, the storecard for Comet, B&amp;Q, Woolworths and Superdrug, said 60 per cent of its customers always paid their bills in full.</p> <p><strong>Interest (APR) if payment not by direct debit </strong></p> <p>Some cards charge less for payment by direct debit.</p> <p><strong>Timecard</strong> 31.9</p> <p><strong>Kwik Fit</strong> 31.8</p> <p><strong>Creation Account Cards</strong> 30.9</p> <p><strong>Country Casuals</strong> 30.7</p> <p><strong>Laura Ashley</strong> 30.7</p> <p><strong>Monsoon</strong> 30.7</p> <p><strong>Russell &amp; Bromley</strong> 30.7</p> <p><strong>Arcadia</strong> 29.9</p> <p><strong>Debenhams</strong> 29.9</p> <p><strong>Allders</strong> 29.8</p> <p><strong>Jaegar</strong> 29.8</p> <p><strong>Viyella</strong> 29.8</p> <p><strong>FraserCard</strong> 29.3</p> <p><strong>Bhs</strong> 29.0</p> <p><strong>Habitat</strong> 29.0</p> <p><strong>IKEA</strong> 29.0</p> <p><strong>Mothercare</strong> 29.0</p> <p><strong>Oasis</strong> 29.0</p> <p><strong>Harrods</strong> 28.9</p> <p><strong>Harvey Nichols</strong> 28.5</p> <p><strong>Selfridges Account</strong> 27.6</p> <p><strong>Argos</strong> 27.0</p> <p><strong>Austin Reed</strong> 26.8</p> <p><strong>Next Gold</strong> 25.9</p> <p><strong>Marks &amp; Spencer</strong> 18.9</p> <p><strong>Fortnum &amp; Mason</strong> 15.3</p> <p><strong>John Lewis</strong> (Introductory rate 6.5%) 13.0</p> <p><strong>Waitrose</strong> (Introductory rate 6.5%) 13.0 </p> <p>Arcadia card can be used in: Burtons, Dorothy Perkins, Evans, Principles, Topshop/Man.

      "bodyText": "Many shoppers who sign up for an interest-free deal are caught out by the small print. The deal they agree to is that no interest will be paid as long as the entire balance is paid off by a certain date. But paying it off is not as easy as it sounds. Customers have found that when they try to pay, the finance firm asks for payment by cheque. In some cases the cheque is then lost or delayed - and the finance firms insist on claiming huge amounts of interest according to the let ter of the contract. Some contracts even have small print saying that payment must reach the company five days before the deadline. The National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux is so concerned it has issued a warning to consumers to ask for the final deadline before they sign the deal and to find out how the payment must be made. The Finance and Leasing Association is also troubled by the growing number of people caught in this situation. It has issued new guide lines to lenders saying reminders should be sent out a month before the deadline and that leeway must be given if a payment is a little late. Clerical assistant Jenny Justice (above) bought a television for \u00a3379 from Powerhouse in Southampton on six months' interest-free credit last June, paying a deposit of \u00a350. The balance had to be paid in full by 17 December. Jenny has had similar deals in the past and has always paid up on time. In her case if the balance was not paid off by that date, the deal would no longer be interest-free. She would then be switched to an interest-bearing deal over three-and-a-half years. When Jenny signed the deal she had to fill out direct debit forms. That was so that if she did not make the 17 December deadline, the company would start taking direct debits each month. In the first week of December, Jenny realised she had not been sent instructions as to how to pay off the balance. She phoned the finance company First National Tricity, owned by Abbey National Bank, and was told to send a cheque. Jenny posted this cheque on 9 December. She did not check her bank statements until mid-January and discovered that the finance company had taken two direct debit payments of \u00a316.57 - as well as cashing her cheque for the full \u00a3329. Jenny, of Romsey, Hampshire, said: 'I phoned them to point out the error, expecting the whole thing to be very quickly sorted out. Instead, they insisted that I had not paid off the amount on time. They claimed my cheque had not arrived with them until 27 December. They said the cheque was cashed on 29 December.' This meant Jenny was no longer on an interest-free deal. Instead, she would have to pay the \u00a316.57 every month for 42 months until the balance was paid off. That is at an APR (annual percentage rate) of 34.2 per cent. In total, she would have to pay \u00a3695.44. Her cheque for \u00a3329 would be counted towards the final sum. Jenny was told her best bet was to agree a settlement figure, which meant she would pay some but not all of the interest. She was sent a proposed settlement fee. First National Tricity were offering to end the agreement for a payment of \u00a3104.84. It claimed she owed \u00a3227.97. That included \u00a3189.10 interest and \u00a338.87 for insurance. Jenny claims she told the sales assistant she did not want insurance, but says that the assistant filled in the paperwork. Jenny said: 'I rang again to query this. I was told during the conversation that I could pay the settlement figure by Switch. So why did they not suggest that when I first phoned them? If they had suggested I pay by Switch then this would never have happened.' We put Jenny's questions to First National Tricity, which said: 'Cheque payment is the method preferred by the company. If a customer inquires about other methods of payment our customer service staff will always offer options. 'During December 2000 we were aware of delays to the post that resulted in customers' cheques not reaching their accounts within the deferred period. A company decision was therefore made to allow extra days' grace on customers' accounts. 'We fully accept Mrs Justice intended to settle her account before the due date and all interest charges have been removed.' NACAB is dealing with seven other cases of people who have been caught out in the same way. But they say this is 'the tip of the iceberg'. A spokeswoman said these are just the cases reported to head office, but there will be many more dealt with at branch level, and many more again not reported to the CAB. She said: 'The problem these companies have got with 0 per cent finance deals, is - what happens if everyone pays up on time? 'The companies tend to be very fussy about payment dates and that is where many people run into difficulties. NACAB has produced a checklist for shoppers: \u0095 Do not let a sales assistant fill in the application for you. \u0095 Take time to understand the offer. \u0095 Make sure you know the final deadline for payment. \u0095 Ask how payment can be made. \u0095 If a direct debit is set up, check the account regularly to see what transactions have been made. \u0095 Check that what you are told by sales staff is written down in the agreement. \u0095 When you are told about credit terms, ask the assistant to point out where they appear in the agreement. Storing up trouble for the future Shoppers paying for goods on store card credit may be paying interest as high as 32 per cent - nearly six times the bank base rate, writes Maria Scott . Store cards are notoriously expensive for people who rack up debt. The rates rarely change and even now, with the base rate at 5.5 per cent, lenders show little sign of budging. There are some cheaper cards in the market (see table) but generally store cards are one of the most expensive ways to borrow. Some shave off a percentage point or so for payment by direct debit, but borrowers who pay off just the minimum pay huge charges. Retailers promote store cards with discounts and other offers. Borrowers canny enough to use the cards for the perks may find them worthwhile since they do not charge annual fees and can provide up to two months' free credit. But borrow long term and you pay up to three times what you would on conventional credit cards. A spokeswoman for Timecard, the storecard for Comet, B&amp;Q, Woolworths and Superdrug, said 60 per cent of its customers always paid their bills in full. Interest (APR) if payment not by direct debit Some cards charge less for payment by direct debit.

From next April, the tax treatment of company cars is going to be turned upside down and many will be forced to give up their dream machine in favour of a clean machine. Until now, you could reduce the tax you paid on the benefit of your company vehicle by clocking up the maximum number of business miles each year; from next April, the tax will be calculated on the basis of how environmentally 'clean' the car is judged to be in terms of its emissions, and the number of miles driven will be irrelevant. The idea is to get people driving greener cars, but in practice, that is usually synonymous with smaller cars, since the amount of pollution you produce is largely dependent on the size of the engine. </p> <p>Those who spend most time in their cars will be hit hardest; currently, if you drive more than 18,000 business miles a year, you pay tax on just 15 per cent of the value of the car; but somebody driving a gas-guzzler like a Mercedes will see that shoot up to 35 per cent of the car's value, more than doubling their tax bill. The liability of a 2.2 litre Vauxhall Vectra will be set at 22 per cent of its value from next April, but a ratchet effect will make the liability of each model go up progressively after that, as the emissions threshold is lowered. </p> <p>Next April may seem a long way off, but Alison Chapman, a tax partner at accountant Deloitte &amp; Touche, says company car drivers should be thinking about it now. 'The average replacement cycle for a company car is three to four years,' she says. 'So if you change your car this year, you may end up driving it for three years under the new tax regime.' </p> <p>She says that many people with company cars will find it hard to accept the idea of downgrading to a smaller vehicle. 'If you spend a huge amount of time in your car, say you're doing 20,000 miles plus, then you are going to feel you need a comfortable car. A lot of salespeople need extra space to carry samples and other goods,' she points out. </p> <p>Chapman says she believes that employees will also find it hard to accept a lower value car than they are entitled to. 'I don't think many companies are going to say that if you choose a cheaper car, we'll give you some extra money and, psychologically, people will feel that they're losing out,' she says. Even more of a thorny issue is the status symbol that the company car has come to represent in the UK workplace, and the loss of status that would be implied by downsizing. Swap my Passat for a Polo? You've got to be joking. </p> <p> John Manion, a principal at remuneration consultants Towers Perrin, says the car's importance as a status symbol varies from company to company and industry to industry. 'It's partly a question of visibility; in London, nobody has a clue what car you drive,' he says. 'But if you're a firm in Yorkshire where everyone drives to work and passes you in the car park, it's a different matter.' </p> <p>The pecking order of company cars is particularly important in sectors such as pharmaceuticals and consumer goods, he says, but less so in IT, where the car culture doesn't have such a long tradition. For the salesman the perception is particularly acute. 'If you drive up to your customer's gate in a flashy car, then people are likely to think you're a better salesman.' </p> <p>Alison Chapman has experienced at first hand how your company car can affect colleagues' perception of you. She says that when she became a partner at Deloitte &amp; Touche, she had to surrender the company BMW and buy her own car. 'I wasn't going to pay for a BMW myself, so I ended up with a third-hand Hyundai Sonata, and people said 'poor you', assuming I'd been demoted,' she says. </p> <p>She believes that many high-mileage company car drivers who face the prospect of downgrading will prefer to pay the higher tax, or even opt out of their company car for the first time and take the cash alternative. One advantage of doing so is that you have more choice over the car you choose and you can even opt to spend the money on something else, like a conservatory. She also predicts that some low-mileage 'perk' drivers who gave up their company car for cash will opt back in, as they will no longer be penalised for their low business miles. </p> <p>However, many in the motor industry believe that the change of taxation will have the desired effect in making many people opt for less polluting cars. In last year's Lex Vehicle Leasing Report on Company Motoring, some 42 per cent said they would 'get a car with lower emissions' as a result of the new tax regime, while only 18 per cent said they would give up having a company car. </p> <p>John Stanley, spokesman for the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, says: 'There has been a general trend in car registrations towards smaller vehicles, and that is not just among private buyers but also among fleets.

      "body": "<p>Many high street firms now offer 0 per cent finance, but finance companies do not lend at 0 per cent. They buy the money they lend at about 3.5 per cent, so will not be lending it for nothing. </p> <p>At jeweller Ernest Jones, any item of jewellery costing over \u00a3200 is available on interest-free credit. </p> <p>If you choose a ring that costs \u00a3300, say, finance company GE Capital Bank will, if it approves you, lend you the \u00a3300. But the lender will want back not \u00a3300 but \u00a3300 plus interest, and this is paid by the retailer. </p> <p>In the used car trade, a common scam is to offer 0 per cent finance in large adverts just to bring people in. Those who respond find the offer is restricted to one or two expensive cars - and then only if they pay a 50 per cent deposit, which no one who buys on finance can afford. </p> <p>So are high street shops now employing the same tactics as the less scrupulous elements of the used car trade? </p> <p> The Observer asked Paul Witts, of advertising agency The Creative, which specialises in the finance-led retail market, to explain how some of the deals on the market operate. </p> <p><strong> Ernest Jones</strong> </p> <p> The jeweller offers interest-free credit on items over \u00a3200. On \u00a3200 you pay a 10 per cent deposit and get six months to pay. On \u00a3500 you pay 20 per cent and get nine months' credit. On anything over \u00a31,000 you also pay 20 per cent but get 12 months to pay. If you pay this amount in the time given, there is no interest charged. </p> <p> <strong> Verdict</strong> </p> <p> This is a genuine offer, not like the car trade scams. The customer gets credit over a short term and does not pay interest. The vendors pay the interest themselves. So they are in fact taking a price cut on the goods. </p> <p>The finance will not be as expensive for the vendors as it would for you or me - especially if they bring the finance firm a lot of work. The vendors will be borrowing at a cheap rate and will get a commission on the deal, or a cheaper rate still. But though it is not as easy to jack up prices for jewellery as it is in the car trade, it would be surprising if the vendor's price list did not include a margin for this. </p> <p>The law does not allow the vendor to offer an alternative to 0 per cent finance. So a customer can't point out that the offer amounts to a price cut and get a lower price for cash. </p> <p>You will probably find jewellers are keen to sell you a warranty or some kind of insurance to get back some of the amount by which they are subsidising your deal. </p> <p> <strong> Dixons</strong> </p> <p> Typical deals include a stereo for \u00a3199 or a Bosch television for \u00a3649 on six months' interest-free credit. </p> <p>There are two options on offer. One is an interest-free option where you pay nothing for six months then pay the balance or go into a finance deal at 29 per cent over 48 months. </p> <p>Or you can choose to make monthly interest-free payments over six months. After six months you can pay the balance or go into a deal at 19.8 per cent. </p> <p>If you decide not to pay the balance you will just carry on making monthly payments until the account is settled. Dixons uses two finance companies, HFC Bank and GE Capital Bank. </p> <p> <strong> Verdict</strong> </p> <p> Again, this is a genuine offer of a subsidised finance deal. But if the balance is not paid off, the customer automatically switches to another agreement with a high rate of interest. The second offer, at 19.8 per cent, is a better deal, but the rate is still high. </p> <p>In both cases the store is gambling on people not paying off the entire sum in six months. </p> <p> <strong> John Lewis</strong> </p> <p> Customers are offered 'extended' credit on larger items such as furniture and carpets over a longer period of time. </p> <p>You take out a deal over nine, 12, 18, 24, 30 or 36 months. On each you pay a minimum deposit of 10 per cent. The typical APR (annual percentage rate of interest) is 13 per cent. A three-seater sofa for \u00a31,850 would cost \u00a32,189.48 over 36 months. That's \u00a3339.48 interest. The John Lewis company provides its own finance. </p> <p> <strong> Verdict</strong> </p> <p> As always, buying on credit costs more. But at least in this case it is quite clear from the start how much more. An interest rate of 13 per cent is realistic and is the standard for this sort of deal. </p> <p>Most companies will not be able to do a deal at less than about 13 per cent, including a profit, because of the cost to them of buying in the money they lend. So if you see rates lower than this, beware: you often pay more in the end. </p> <p>For its its part, Dixons denies that its finance deals could confuse people and says credit gives customers more freedom of choice. </p> <p>A spokeswoman said: 'We offer credit as a way of giving extra choice to customers. A detailed credit check is carried out before an interest-free option is offered, so only customers in a stable situation will be given these deals. </p> <p>'Our staff are trained to explain agreements carefully. In the case of interest-free options, a clear reminder is always sent out one month before the end of the interest-free period. We are simply offering the customer an alternative method of paying.' </p> <p>The fact that stores are not allowed to offer an alternative to a 0 per cent finance deal is helping to establish this as a high street selling tool. If the standard rate of finance is 13 per cent, which is about what a bank loan would cost, the customer appears to be getting a 13 per cent discount. In fact, the store is subsidising the deal by much less than that because it gets finance at a far lower rate. </p> <p>The more 0 per cent finance deals a retailer does, the cheaper that finance gets. Not only does it appear to offer a big discount, but it can sell to people who do not have any money. </p> <p>Once the deal is signed, the finance company pays the store for the goods - less the interest on the deal - and the store gets its money on the spot. If the customer has trouble paying, that the finance firm's problem. </p> <p>But Witts believes 0 per cent finance can have its upside for customers: 'As long as you pay it off on time, it is free credit.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "Many high street firms now offer 0 per cent finance, but finance companies do not lend at 0 per cent. They buy the money they lend at about 3.5 per cent, so will not be lending it for nothing. At jeweller Ernest Jones, any item of jewellery costing over \u00a3200 is available on interest-free credit. If you choose a ring that costs \u00a3300, say, finance company GE Capital Bank will, if it approves you, lend you the \u00a3300. But the lender will want back not \u00a3300 but \u00a3300 plus interest, and this is paid by the retailer. In the used car trade, a common scam is to offer 0 per cent finance in large adverts just to bring people in. Those who respond find the offer is restricted to one or two expensive cars - and then only if they pay a 50 per cent deposit, which no one who buys on finance can afford. So are high street shops now employing the same tactics as the less scrupulous elements of the used car trade? The Observer asked Paul Witts, of advertising agency The Creative, which specialises in the finance-led retail market, to explain how some of the deals on the market operate. Ernest Jones The jeweller offers interest-free credit on items over \u00a3200. On \u00a3200 you pay a 10 per cent deposit and get six months to pay. On \u00a3500 you pay 20 per cent and get nine months' credit. On anything over \u00a31,000 you also pay 20 per cent but get 12 months to pay. If you pay this amount in the time given, there is no interest charged. Verdict This is a genuine offer, not like the car trade scams. The customer gets credit over a short term and does not pay interest. The vendors pay the interest themselves. So they are in fact taking a price cut on the goods. The finance will not be as expensive for the vendors as it would for you or me - especially if they bring the finance firm a lot of work. The vendors will be borrowing at a cheap rate and will get a commission on the deal, or a cheaper rate still. But though it is not as easy to jack up prices for jewellery as it is in the car trade, it would be surprising if the vendor's price list did not include a margin for this. The law does not allow the vendor to offer an alternative to 0 per cent finance. So a customer can't point out that the offer amounts to a price cut and get a lower price for cash. You will probably find jewellers are keen to sell you a warranty or some kind of insurance to get back some of the amount by which they are subsidising your deal. Dixons Typical deals include a stereo for \u00a3199 or a Bosch television for \u00a3649 on six months' interest-free credit. There are two options on offer. One is an interest-free option where you pay nothing for six months then pay the balance or go into a finance deal at 29 per cent over 48 months. Or you can choose to make monthly interest-free payments over six months. After six months you can pay the balance or go into a deal at 19.8 per cent. If you decide not to pay the balance you will just carry on making monthly payments until the account is settled. Dixons uses two finance companies, HFC Bank and GE Capital Bank. Verdict Again, this is a genuine offer of a subsidised finance deal. But if the balance is not paid off, the customer automatically switches to another agreement with a high rate of interest. The second offer, at 19.8 per cent, is a better deal, but the rate is still high. In both cases the store is gambling on people not paying off the entire sum in six months. John Lewis Customers are offered 'extended' credit on larger items such as furniture and carpets over a longer period of time. You take out a deal over nine, 12, 18, 24, 30 or 36 months. On each you pay a minimum deposit of 10 per cent. The typical APR (annual percentage rate of interest) is 13 per cent. A three-seater sofa for \u00a31,850 would cost \u00a32,189.48 over 36 months. That's \u00a3339.48 interest. The John Lewis company provides its own finance. Verdict As always, buying on credit costs more. But at least in this case it is quite clear from the start how much more. An interest rate of 13 per cent is realistic and is the standard for this sort of deal. Most companies will not be able to do a deal at less than about 13 per cent, including a profit, because of the cost to them of buying in the money they lend. So if you see rates lower than this, beware: you often pay more in the end. For its its part, Dixons denies that its finance deals could confuse people and says credit gives customers more freedom of choice. A spokeswoman said: 'We offer credit as a way of giving extra choice to customers. A detailed credit check is carried out before an interest-free option is offered, so only customers in a stable situation will be given these deals. 'Our staff are trained to explain agreements carefully. In the case of interest-free options, a clear reminder is always sent out one month before the end of the interest-free period. We are simply offering the customer an alternative method of paying.' The fact that stores are not allowed to offer an alternative to a 0 per cent finance deal is helping to establish this as a high street selling tool. If the standard rate of finance is 13 per cent, which is about what a bank loan would cost, the customer appears to be getting a 13 per cent discount. In fact, the store is subsidising the deal by much less than that because it gets finance at a far lower rate. The more 0 per cent finance deals a retailer does, the cheaper that finance gets. Not only does it appear to offer a big discount, but it can sell to people who do not have any money. Once the deal is signed, the finance company pays the store for the goods - less the interest on the deal - and the store gets its money on the spot. If the customer has trouble paying, that the finance firm's problem. But Witts believes 0 per cent finance can have its upside for customers: 'As long as you pay it off on time, it is free credit.'",

'The trouble for us is that some people will buy a car and drive it for six months and then, when it breaks down, try to claim that it was not of saleable quality in the first place.' The law may change soon. An EC directive currently in consultation (1999/44/EC) is considering changing the rules so consumers do not have to prove that goods are at fault. One suggestion being considered is that no proof at all be required within the first six months. However, retailers would probably be allowed to repair or replace rather than offer a full refund.",

An accomplished stand-up and sketch comedian, he favoured chat, insight and observation over gags.</p> <p>Yet his roots were deeply buried in old-style entertainment, and in recent years he was regarded as an encyclopaedia of Scottish popular theatre, his speciality being Sir Harry Lauder, whom he met as a child. In turn, Logan influenced others: Billy Connolly decided to become an entertainer after seeing him in pantomime.</p> <p>Based in Glasgow, he was one of five children of a famous family. His parents, Jack Short and May Dalziel, were a Glasgow music-hall double act. His aunt, Ella Logan, was a Broadway singer who starred in the original Finian's Rainbow, and his sister, Annabelle, is jazz singer Annie Ross, of Lambert, Hendricks and Ross.</p> <p>Logan began work as a child, selling programmes at his parents' shows. He left school at 14 and became assistant manager of Paisley's Victory Theatre. By the mid-1940s he was featuring in his parents' show, Ma and Pa Logan, at Glasgow's Metropole, and at 19 was principal comedian at the Metropole.</p> <p>As a young man he modelled himself on the Scottish matinee idol and song and dance star of the 1930s and 40s Jack Buchanan, who had made a good living playing languid Englishmen. Logan devised a series of sophisticated revues, Five Past Eight, that drew Scotland-wide audiences to Glasgow's Alhambra Theatre. He also did around 150 radio shows with his friend Stanley Baxter.</p> <p>Logan's stage act included character-based sketches, and these transferred well to the British television of the 1950s. He starred in Saturday Showtime, written by Eric Sykes, for ITV in 1956, and from 1957 to 1961 in BBC TV's Jimmy Logan Show - much of it written by himself.</p> <p>His Scots accent, though broad, was not indecipherable to English viewers, although he was happy to lay the doric on with a trowel much later in his career as Rab C Nesbitt's father-in-law in the successful comedy TV series of the 1990s.</p> <p>In Scotland, and occasionally elsewhere in Britain, Jimmy Logan appeared in 35 pantomimes, usually as the dame, and when variety went into decline he switched with ease to straight acting. He appeared in Scotland and England in Harvey, The Entertainer, Death of a Salesman, Comedians, Uncle Vanya and many other stage plays.</p> <p>In the 1986, at the behest of Frank Dunlop, he took his one-man show about Sir Harry Lauder to the Edinburgh Festival, playing, not inappropriately, at the town hall in nearby Portobello, where the tang of the sea wafted in on the performance. He toured the show extensively, dancing and working his way through 36 Lauder songs. In 1993 came a follow-up at the festival. The Fabulous Fifties was a nostalgic evocation of Scottish variety's last gasp.</p> <p>Earlier he had tried his hand at business by buying the Metropole, but it was not a success. The theatre closed and Logan lost a lot of money.</p> <p>Logan's warmth and sincerity shone through his performances. The story is told of a disastrous production of Sinbad the Sailor at the Alhambra in the 1960s, when a burst pipe caused the safety curtain to fall, halting proceedings. Logan ad-libbed in front of the curtain to the 2,000-strong audience for a while and then asked the orchestra leader to find the theatre carpenter, who had worked there all his life and was about to retire. The bemused carpenter suddenly found himself on stage with Logan doing a This is Your Life on him, and soon the audience was spellbound by the old man's stories of the great music hall stars he had known. It was quite a disappointment when the pantomime was able to recommence.</p> <p>That night at the Alhambra was an example not only of Logan's quick-wittedness but of his humanity and respect for the unsung people of the theatre. Even as a young man, he campaigned at Equity meetings for the rights of chorus girls and smaller acts.</p> <p>He had made his credited film debut at 21 in the Clydebank drama Floodtide (1949), with Gordon Jackson and Rona Anderson, but a cinema career did not follow, although there were a trickle of roles and he appeared in Carry on Abroad (1972) and Carry on Girls (1973).</p> <p>In 1990 his services to Scottish entertainment, and to charity, led to Logan being awarded an OBE. One of his last major dramatic roles was something of a tribute from an old admirer, appearing alongside Billy Connolly in Anthony Neilson's The Debt Collector (1998).

      "body": "<p>Spain is blazing with poppies, orchids and wild flowers at the moment, but with Semana Santa, Holy Week, and Easter upon us, a riot of human colour is also erupting across the country. During Holy Week, processions sway and thump through towns and villages decked out in the full regalia of church and Inquisition. Semana Santa (April 8-15 this year) heralds the approach of Spain's fiestas and ferias (local fairs), and the start of the bull-fighting season. There is hardly any time of year when a village or hamlet is without some feast or other, but May to July sees some of the most beautiful and dramatic, especially in the south. Prices go up dramatically during Feria and it is always advisable to book a hotel well in advance. Then again, you may not go to bed at all.</p> <p><strong>Seville</strong> (April 29-May 7)</p> <p>The best way to irritate a rural Andalucian is to tell them that nobody parties like they do in Seville. The Holy Week pageants are some of Spain's most moving and Sevillians will certainly claim their April Feria is the best. From the moment the lights go on in the Real de La Feria, the city hardly sleeps for a week. Not that Sevillians are very good at getting to bed at any time of the year, but the Feria is their chance to prove their stamina.</p> <p>Whole families emerge from their houses dressed like a picaresque tableau, with even the tiniest children done up like pocket Carmens. But then Seville is the home of the cigarette factory that inspired Bizet's best tunes. Round a corner you will hear clapping and be confronted by the spectacle of a spontaneous Sevilliana, the local dance that is quick to pick up and essential if you want to enjoy the party. In the afternoons, the Sevillian horses clip-clop under the orange and lemon trees, often more brightly attired than their riders. The city plays host to several funfairs, too, and the best flamenco bars are to be found along the Calle Vetis. </p> <p>\u0095 For further information, visit: <a href=\"http://www.sevilla.org\" target=\"_new\"> www.sevilla.org</a>.

This is followed by the Feria of Corpus Christi, which is given much of its flavour by the fact that Granada is a university town, and young as well as old dress up in traditional garb. The city has the added attraction of the gypsy caves at Sacramonte, where you can see flamenco most days of the year. But be warned, the place has become very touristy and exploitative and it is always best to make friends of a local who can show you the more authentic spots.

It centres around the park Gonzalez Hontoria and for a week under the jacaranda trees, this elegant, wealthy town - home of sherry, bull breeding, flamenco and the Spanish Riding School - becomes a vignette of old Espa\u00f1a. It is a true horse fair and they do things in style. Here you will see some of the finest examples of Andalucia's famous dancing horses alongside almost every equine breed under the sun, while there are riding competitions and the grand parade of riders and carriages. </p> <p>Couples in traditional Traje (polka dot dresses for the women and gaucho hats, chaps and waistcoats for the men) really indulge in the Spanish talent for flirting and display. The paseo, the evening stroll, is raised to a fine art in Jerez.

But its feria, of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Salud, is gentler than Seville's and is at its most entrancing when the Juderia, the old, labyrinthine Jewish quarter along the side of the Mesquita (mosque) begins to jostle with costumes and dancers. For a very unusual festival, visit the Festival de Patios Cordobeses a week before. The city will probably be less full and accommodation easier to find for the ensuing party. The Spanish patio has its roots both in Roman and Arabic culture and families unlock a floral and architectural treasury, hidden for the rest of the year behind sturdy iron grates, as they compete to delight visitors and win prizes. Cordoba also hosts a flamenco festival every two years, this year April 27-May 12, and a festival of guitar in the first two weeks of July.</p> <p>\u0095 For further information, visit: <a href=\"http://www.ayuncordoba.es\" target=\"_new\"> www.ayuncordoba.es</a>.

The Pregon is delivered by the mayor on the day of the saint, even if no one's listening, and then the games begin. The capital may have little of the intimacy of, say, Jerez or Cordoba, but it has its own attractions and the Fiesta of San Isidro is especially significant as it heralds the start of the capital's bullfighting season, and for bull and matador alike all roads lead to Madrid.

The pilgrimage - or romer\u00eda - is not for tourists and to follow the Camino (the way) through the Cota Donana National Park, you really need to be invited along by one of the Brotherhoods, semi-religious guilds that set out in full costume from villages right across Spain. They converge on the little town of El Rocio, following their local virgins in flower-decked carriages pulled by oxen. There, after days of ecstatic partying, the young men of the mountain town of Almonte, and only they, literally fight for the right to manhandle a huge silver Madonna around town. \"The Paloma Blanca\", or White Dove, as she is called, is said to be the source of many a miraculous cure, and to take \"the promise\" to join the pilgrimage is probably the Andalucian equivalent of going to Mecca, rivalled only by the more sober northern route of Santiago del La Compostela. Part religious festival, part pagan rite, all the traditions, prejudices and superstitions of Andalucia converge at the little town. </p> <p>It is possible at least to watch the start, and one of the best places is Sanlucar de Barrameda, from where Columbus set sail in 1492. The procession that leads the virgin is splendid and there is little to compare with the sight of army landing craft carrying the horses and pilgrims across the Guadalquivir river and into the national park. Sanlucar also hosts a sherry festival in early April, flamenco, jazz and music festivals and its famous beachfront horse races in August.</p> <p>\u0095 Further information from the Sanlucar Tourist Office, Calzada del Ejercito.

Immortalised by Hemingway in The Sun Also Rises, a novel slimmer than a cape, the festival of San Fermin is when the young men run with the bulls, someone invariably gets badly hurt or even killed, and the tabloids start running their campaigns about Spanish cruelty to animals. The fiesta itself is a feast of fireworks, music and processions, rich in tradition and spoilt perhaps only by the sheer weight of visitors. The dangerous bit, for humans at least, is when the bulls are let loose every morning from the Coralillos of Santo Domingo to run the course to the town's ring, where the daily fights take place. To take part, you will have to be at the start before 8am when rockets signal the beginning of the mayhem. Pamplona can be one of Spain's most exciting and most upsetting fiesta, but one of its nicest moments is when it winds up on July 14 with a candle-lit procession.</p> <p>\u0095 Tourist Office: Calle de Duque de Ahumada 3.

But Malagans have always known how to have a good time and their feria is one of the most exuberant.</p> <p>In the day, the fun takes place in the streets and bars across the city and at night switches to the Cortijo de Torres on the edge of town.

      "body": "<p>The centre of Leeds is a terrible place for pedestrian-on-pedestrian bumps, on account of the number of distracting cherubs, owls and bare-breasted ladies cavorting on the buildings above. Every other facade in the square mile of largely traffic-free streets is Victorian or Edwardian, and no good merchant prince in those days thought that plain pediments and lintels were enough to get passers-by tilting their admiring heads.</p> <p>The resulting, rampant friezes and bas-reliefs would be a half-day preoccupation in themselves, but they are only a backdrop to more than 40 pieces of free-standing sculptures or statues. Famous, or notorious, for claiming the title of \"Britain's Barcelona\" because of its nightclubs and dry climate, Leeds has genuinely better reason to aim for a European sculptural crown.</p> <p>It is not just a matter of the finest ensemble of Victorian statuary outside London, in the flamboyant collection of nymphs, worthies and the Black Prince on his vast charger in City Square. The city is also a place where an exceptional number of sculptors have been born, studied or turned teacher themselves, almost always interacting with the work of their predecessors.</p> <p>Ralph Brown RA, son of a Leeds school caretaker, used to admire the nymphs' curving bottoms when he changed trams in City Square. So did Kenneth Armitage, Barbara Hepworth and Henry Moore. The illustrious roll-call suggests something in the water, people say, or more probably the stone; but there is actually nothing mysterious about the wealth of talent. </p> <p>From the early 18th century, when the Moot Hall statue of Queen Anne had an inscription emphasising that it was \"distinguished far beyond the one in St Paul's, London\" , civic pride and local money led to plenty of commissions in Leeds and places for plinths. The patronage was then given an edge by the arrival in Leeds of a series of cultured academics, especially once the Yorkshire College became Leeds University in 1905. </p> <p>One of the first vice-chancellors, Sir Michael Sadler, caused (and enjoyed) a series of tremendous rows which foreshadowed the Tate bricks controversy. His attempt to fill Leeds' sacred Town Hall with modern frescoes ended in glorious failure, but he got an Eric Gill tablet of Christ scourging some Yorkshire-looking moneylenders bolted to a university wall. His successor tried to cover it with ivy, but was always foiled by a modernist gardener, who snipped away the tendrils, saying doggedly that that he was paid to keep the place tidy. Frederick Gregory, who was head of the high-quality Bradford printing firm Lund Humphries, then used his money to seal Sir Michael's victory for ever. His Gregory Fellowships have brought just about every major post-war British sculptor to Leeds for a spell, many of them leaving reminders of their stay in bronze, marble or - in Austin Wright's case - concrete encased in aluminium. </p> <p>Their talent was also drawn by the mighty examples of Moore and Hepworth who both studied at Leeds School of Art (still a thriving alma mater which most recently produced Damien Hirst); and by their classmate Sir Herbert Read, the outstanding authority on 20th- century sculpture, whose son Benedict (the outstanding authority on Victorian sculpture) now teaches at Leeds University.</p> <p>This tremendous history means that the city's predictable (but notably fine) collection of figurative statues has a strong 20th-century counterbalance; and the commissions are still coming in. A playful bronze tribute to petanque by Roger Burnett - a Yorkshire family watching a Frenchman aiming at the cochonnet in Leeds' central boules park - was installed in October. A 17ft-high sculpture by Graham Ibbeson, creator of Eric Morecambe's eternally sunshine dance in Morecambe, was unveiled on March 24.</p> <p>These form two points on the serpentine Leeds Sculpture Trail, whose statues are complemented by an accompanying booklet and a series of links on the BBC's Leeds Online website.</p> <p>There are breathtaking moments for those who believe that everything was dour and hard-headed in a 19th-century northern city. Alfred Drury's Circe, waving her wand (now sadly lost) above hogs that were secretly meant to represent Leeds aldermen, is thoroughly erotic and the eight nymphs - also by Drury and strictly speaking called Morn and Eve - are nubile, too. When they were last cleaned, the workmen insisted on screens to hide the heavy-duty buffing of bosom and buttock involved.</p> <p>And then there are the owls - the civic symbol of Leeds. They are everywhere, modestly topping iron railings or hugely prominent, doubling as lightning conductors on Leeds Civic Hall and keeping an eye on the new \u00a312 million Millennium Square.</p> <p>This is about to see the city's third and fourth sculpture unveilings in six months, when Both Arms by Kenneth Armitage (another Leeds-born RA) and a vast rugby ball by Richard Wilson are put in place. Nelson Mandela will open a new garden in the square on April 30. The installations will be complemented by an exhibition at the final stop on the trail, Leeds city art gallery and the linked Henry Moore Institute, which have Rodins, Flaxmans and Moores a-plenty, plus the usual good and startlingly-cheap Yorkshire caff. </p> <p>Leeds Statues Trail by Melanie Hall follows two tours and is available from Leeds Civic Trust, LS2 7EQ \u00a32.50 (but does not include sculpture later than 1995). <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/leeds\" target=\"_new\"> www.bbc.co.uk/leeds</a> has an up-to-the-minute tour of \"the city's silent observers\" and many useful links</p> <p> <strong>Cast of major players </strong></p> <p><strong>1</strong> The collection in City Square of eminent Victorians, plus the Black Prince, has recently been joined by a graceful eddy of gulls and a beady-eyed pigeon, the work of Lorne McKeane. The prince was so vast that no British foundry could cast him, and he came in a barge from Belgium, just avoiding bridges over the Aire and Calder navigation from Hull.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Graham Ibbeson sculpted Arthur Aaron VC, after the war hero won a city-wide vote last year for the subject of a Millennium Sculpture, beating more obvious candidates such as Joshua Tetley of beer fame, Don Revie of Leeds United and Henry Moore.</p> <p><strong> 3</strong> Robert Peel by William Behnes was the first of 26 statues of the politician, erected after his death in a riding accident in 1850 which triggered \"Peelmania\" . The statue was the first bronze figure in Britain to be cast in one piece, and one of the first to show a statesman in contemporary dress rather than classical drapery.</p> <p><strong> 4</strong> Leeds Town Hall lions have been consistently popular since they were installed in 1867, partly because of William Keyworth's endearingly friendly (though noble) carving but more because they cost \u00a3550 compared with the \u00a311,000 paid for their counterparts in Trafalgar Square. Keyworth never visited Africa but spent a lot of time at Regent's Park zoo.</p> <p><strong> 5</strong> Hermes at Leeds University is enjoying a second life and change of name. He was salvaged from the former Midland Bank in Park Row when the building was demolished. When originally commissioned from William Chattaway in 1970, he was called \"The Spirit of Free Enterprise\".</p>",

      "bodyText": "The centre of Leeds is a terrible place for pedestrian-on-pedestrian bumps, on account of the number of distracting cherubs, owls and bare-breasted ladies cavorting on the buildings above. Every other facade in the square mile of largely traffic-free streets is Victorian or Edwardian, and no good merchant prince in those days thought that plain pediments and lintels were enough to get passers-by tilting their admiring heads. The resulting, rampant friezes and bas-reliefs would be a half-day preoccupation in themselves, but they are only a backdrop to more than 40 pieces of free-standing sculptures or statues. Famous, or notorious, for claiming the title of \"Britain's Barcelona\" because of its nightclubs and dry climate, Leeds has genuinely better reason to aim for a European sculptural crown. It is not just a matter of the finest ensemble of Victorian statuary outside London, in the flamboyant collection of nymphs, worthies and the Black Prince on his vast charger in City Square. The city is also a place where an exceptional number of sculptors have been born, studied or turned teacher themselves, almost always interacting with the work of their predecessors. Ralph Brown RA, son of a Leeds school caretaker, used to admire the nymphs' curving bottoms when he changed trams in City Square. So did Kenneth Armitage, Barbara Hepworth and Henry Moore. The illustrious roll-call suggests something in the water, people say, or more probably the stone; but there is actually nothing mysterious about the wealth of talent. From the early 18th century, when the Moot Hall statue of Queen Anne had an inscription emphasising that it was \"distinguished far beyond the one in St Paul's, London\" , civic pride and local money led to plenty of commissions in Leeds and places for plinths. The patronage was then given an edge by the arrival in Leeds of a series of cultured academics, especially once the Yorkshire College became Leeds University in 1905. One of the first vice-chancellors, Sir Michael Sadler, caused (and enjoyed) a series of tremendous rows which foreshadowed the Tate bricks controversy. His attempt to fill Leeds' sacred Town Hall with modern frescoes ended in glorious failure, but he got an Eric Gill tablet of Christ scourging some Yorkshire-looking moneylenders bolted to a university wall. His successor tried to cover it with ivy, but was always foiled by a modernist gardener, who snipped away the tendrils, saying doggedly that that he was paid to keep the place tidy. Frederick Gregory, who was head of the high-quality Bradford printing firm Lund Humphries, then used his money to seal Sir Michael's victory for ever. His Gregory Fellowships have brought just about every major post-war British sculptor to Leeds for a spell, many of them leaving reminders of their stay in bronze, marble or - in Austin Wright's case - concrete encased in aluminium. Their talent was also drawn by the mighty examples of Moore and Hepworth who both studied at Leeds School of Art (still a thriving alma mater which most recently produced Damien Hirst); and by their classmate Sir Herbert Read, the outstanding authority on 20th- century sculpture, whose son Benedict (the outstanding authority on Victorian sculpture) now teaches at Leeds University. This tremendous history means that the city's predictable (but notably fine) collection of figurative statues has a strong 20th-century counterbalance; and the commissions are still coming in. A playful bronze tribute to petanque by Roger Burnett - a Yorkshire family watching a Frenchman aiming at the cochonnet in Leeds' central boules park - was installed in October. A 17ft-high sculpture by Graham Ibbeson, creator of Eric Morecambe's eternally sunshine dance in Morecambe, was unveiled on March 24. These form two points on the serpentine Leeds Sculpture Trail, whose statues are complemented by an accompanying booklet and a series of links on the BBC's Leeds Online website. There are breathtaking moments for those who believe that everything was dour and hard-headed in a 19th-century northern city. Alfred Drury's Circe, waving her wand (now sadly lost) above hogs that were secretly meant to represent Leeds aldermen, is thoroughly erotic and the eight nymphs - also by Drury and strictly speaking called Morn and Eve - are nubile, too. When they were last cleaned, the workmen insisted on screens to hide the heavy-duty buffing of bosom and buttock involved. And then there are the owls - the civic symbol of Leeds. They are everywhere, modestly topping iron railings or hugely prominent, doubling as lightning conductors on Leeds Civic Hall and keeping an eye on the new \u00a312 million Millennium Square. This is about to see the city's third and fourth sculpture unveilings in six months, when Both Arms by Kenneth Armitage (another Leeds-born RA) and a vast rugby ball by Richard Wilson are put in place. Nelson Mandela will open a new garden in the square on April 30. The installations will be complemented by an exhibition at the final stop on the trail, Leeds city art gallery and the linked Henry Moore Institute, which have Rodins, Flaxmans and Moores a-plenty, plus the usual good and startlingly-cheap Yorkshire caff. Leeds Statues Trail by Melanie Hall follows two tours and is available from Leeds Civic Trust, LS2 7EQ \u00a32.50 (but does not include sculpture later than 1995). www.bbc.co.uk/leeds has an up-to-the-minute tour of \"the city's silent observers\" and many useful links Cast of major players 1 The collection in City Square of eminent Victorians, plus the Black Prince, has recently been joined by a graceful eddy of gulls and a beady-eyed pigeon, the work of Lorne McKeane. The prince was so vast that no British foundry could cast him, and he came in a barge from Belgium, just avoiding bridges over the Aire and Calder navigation from Hull. 2 Graham Ibbeson sculpted Arthur Aaron VC, after the war hero won a city-wide vote last year for the subject of a Millennium Sculpture, beating more obvious candidates such as Joshua Tetley of beer fame, Don Revie of Leeds United and Henry Moore. 3 Robert Peel by William Behnes was the first of 26 statues of the politician, erected after his death in a riding accident in 1850 which triggered \"Peelmania\" . The statue was the first bronze figure in Britain to be cast in one piece, and one of the first to show a statesman in contemporary dress rather than classical drapery. 4 Leeds Town Hall lions have been consistently popular since they were installed in 1867, partly because of William Keyworth's endearingly friendly (though noble) carving but more because they cost \u00a3550 compared with the \u00a311,000 paid for their counterparts in Trafalgar Square. Keyworth never visited Africa but spent a lot of time at Regent's Park zoo. 5 Hermes at Leeds University is enjoying a second life and change of name. He was salvaged from the former Midland Bank in Park Row when the building was demolished. When originally commissioned from William Chattaway in 1970, he was called \"The Spirit of Free Enterprise\".",

C\u00e9zanne's father insisted he study law but C\u00e9zanne abandoned his studies in 1861 and moved to Paris. By 1863 he was exhibiting alongside Manet. C\u00e9zanne's attempts to establish himself as an avant-garde artist competed with his tendency to withdraw, resolving itself in a fascination with landscape, which he started to explore while staying at a house his mother owned at l'Estaque, near Marseille.

Here too he seems a canny country character, a village star. There's a cool authority to the way he stands. You feel he was a man who always dressed the same, behaved the same, and so acquired style.

While his dead-on presentation makes his wide-shouldered body astonishingly flat, C\u00e9zanne allows individual features - collar, shiny pipe, folds of the jacket - to have an almost trompe-l'oeil lift. This is in contrast to a portrait by, say, Holbein, who models the human figure according to the laws of perspective.

      "body": "<p>There are two images of the Rhineland embedded into the popular consciousness. The first is of a fairytale land filled with gothic castles, fine wines, angry dragons, benign Teutonic maidens and lush green pastures. The second is of a popular destination for coachloads of tourists. </p> <p>In the 18th century, however, before mass tourism was ever thought of, the former image reigned supreme, and the Rhineland was as remote and romantic as Venice or the Orient. It was Lord Byron's epic poem Childe Harold's Pilgrimage that described a place where the gallant young man of the title \"gazes on a work divine/A blending of all beauties, streams and dells/Fruit, foliage, crag, wood, cornfield, mountain, vine.\"</p> <p>Byron travelled extensively through the Rhineland after exiling himself from England, and it was his words that were to inspire countless young men to include the area as part of their Grand Tour of Europe, and dream of having their hearts broken by feckless peasant girls on the banks of the great river while they were at it. </p> <p>With this in mind, I ventured on a tour of my own, retracing the steps of the great poet, adding the odd destination for the sake of convenience, and dodging anyone with an American accent who wore socks with their sandals.</p> <p>Hamburg seemed as good a place as any to start a Romantic journey: although Byron never made it this far north. Lord Nelson did, and found love here while his poetic contemporary fled from an unhappy affair further south. It's also likely that Byron would have approved of the attitude to life here. Germany's most famous port brings with it sin, colour and open-mindedness: the infamous Reeperbahn offers every kind of sexual peccadillo known to mankind, including some new ones made possible by the wonders of medical science. The St Pauli port area retains a sense of well-mannered bohemianism: everyone cycles, the waterside bars and restaurants keep going throughout the night, and the Sunday morning Fischmarkt is like a medieval fayre, with traders of every description trying to out-shout one another in order to hawk their disparate wares. </p> <p>Little of the Hamburg of Byron's time remains - a great fire in 1842 and British bombs in 1943 razed the city twice over - but it has been reconstructed in a variety of neos - romanesque, gothic, classical - and now has a traditionalism infused with an embracing of the modern age. From the baroque splendour of the Hotel Atlantic by the Alstadt lake to the proud industrial harshness of the warehouse district, a trade area that has been Customs exempt from 1189, Hamburg has the kind of civilised eclecticism that Byron fled to Europe to immerse himself in.</p> <p>It was time to retrace the steps of Childe Harold. </p> <p>The first mention of the Rhineland in the epic poem is \"The Castle Crag of Drachenfells\" that \"frowns oe'r the wide and winding Rhine\". Drachenfells turned out to be just outside Konigswinter, an unremarkable town with a thriving tourist trade and a large Turkish population whose men work on the river. Beyond the over-stylised bierkellers and the international tourist tat of the high street - anything from bratwurst to batik - lie the beautiful Sibengerberge mountains, of which Drachenfells tops one of seven. A funicular railway from Konigswinter takes you up to the cloud-blanketed castle remains. </p> <p>Moss-encrusted turrets and crumbling ramparts rise out of black, brooding rock, supposedly once inhabited by a dragon who was thought to have been slain by the great German hero Siegfried. </p> <p>A walk through the forest back down to the town takes you past Hansel &amp; Gretel-like houses, woodcutters' shacks, and the macabre, gothic Drachenberg castle, with turrets thin enough and wrought-iron gates imposing enough to make a Grimm's Fairy Tale villain feel at home.</p> <p>From Konigswinter, Childe Harold travelled downstream to stay awhile at Koblenz. The city where the Rhine meets the Mosel river has small cobbled passageways that connect square after square, long flights of steps leading to oval gateways, and streets that are so quiet at night they are reminiscent of the Vienna depicted in Carol Reed's The Third Man. It was to inspire painters like Turner and Stansfield, who, like Byron, came here for the serene yet untamed landscape, the vibrant working life centred around the river, and the abundance of wine that comes from the Riesling grape grown on the area's slate-covered vineyards. </p> <p>The town, which was founded by the Romans in 9BC, was destroyed by the French in 1801 and again by the Allied Forces in 1943, but some of the old world survives: at the corner of land where the two rivers meet is the Bleumenhof flower garden, once home to Koblenz's own group of the Order of Teutonic Knights, and it still houses the Basilika St Kastor, a church built in 836 that once saw Edward I sell his crown when he was strapped for cash. </p> <p>The church was first used by Luis Pius, grandson of Charlemagne, who failed to live up to his name when it was discovered that he had an illegitimate daughter, Rizza, whose image now resides on one of the church's stained-glass windows.</p> <p>Byron was particularly taken by the brutal military might of the fortress Ehrenbreitstein, just across the river from the town and high up on a hill that is traversed by a chairlift. </p> <p>What he referred to as \"A Tower of Victory\" has been used in a military capacity from the time of its construction in the 10th century by the knight Erembert until the second world war: these days it has the slightly emasculated role of being a centre for summer operas.</p> <p>Koblenz still has the romantic spirit that so inspired Byron. It's a quiet town, and the squares are filled with caf\u00e9s, bars and middle-aged women with cropped red hair and old men in caps. There are old-style taverns popular with the ubiquitous elderly American tourists. The baroque four-roomed Weindorf Rest is ideal for sampling the local riesling. </p> <p>Newer restaurants like the Caf\u00e9 Mijoo are favoured by a young local crowd. There are also local stories remembered and celebrated, like the one about Luther of Koburn, a 15th-century robber who stuck out his tongue at the archbishop just as his head was chopped off, only to be found innocent 100 years later. In the town square of Jesuitenplatz, a grimacing figure sticks his tongue out as the clock strikes the hour. And there are no bridges to take you from one tree-lined bank of the river to another, only ferries, including one run by an old man who charges 80 pfennigs for the journey.</p> <p>The most romantic journey of all, which Byron himself undertook, is the river trip from Koblenz to Rudesheim, known as the Rhine Gorge. It is so fairytale, it is ridiculous - all that is missing is a flaxen-haired damsel singing lullabies to her fair knight, who has probably just been eaten by the dragon at Drachenfells. </p> <p>These days, the journey takes four hours, and the best way to travel is on the Goethe paddle steamer. The steamer chugs past the mighty Burg Katz castle, before arriving at Lorelei, the narrowest part of the river and a watery grave for many an unfortunate sailor. Legend has it that this rocky promontory is inhabited by a beautiful woman who lures boats to their doom by singing sweet harmonies; these days the rock is topped by a rather chipped statue of said lady, who looks more like an Essex girl on a night up West than the beguiling Teuton of legend </p> <p>Medieval robber barons once occupied the many castles that the steamer passes from there until Rudesheim, as well as villains like Archbishop Hatto of Meinz, who once lived in the Mauseturm customs tower at Bingen.

      "bodyText": "There are two images of the Rhineland embedded into the popular consciousness. The first is of a fairytale land filled with gothic castles, fine wines, angry dragons, benign Teutonic maidens and lush green pastures. The second is of a popular destination for coachloads of tourists. In the 18th century, however, before mass tourism was ever thought of, the former image reigned supreme, and the Rhineland was as remote and romantic as Venice or the Orient. It was Lord Byron's epic poem Childe Harold's Pilgrimage that described a place where the gallant young man of the title \"gazes on a work divine/A blending of all beauties, streams and dells/Fruit, foliage, crag, wood, cornfield, mountain, vine.\" Byron travelled extensively through the Rhineland after exiling himself from England, and it was his words that were to inspire countless young men to include the area as part of their Grand Tour of Europe, and dream of having their hearts broken by feckless peasant girls on the banks of the great river while they were at it. With this in mind, I ventured on a tour of my own, retracing the steps of the great poet, adding the odd destination for the sake of convenience, and dodging anyone with an American accent who wore socks with their sandals. Hamburg seemed as good a place as any to start a Romantic journey: although Byron never made it this far north. Lord Nelson did, and found love here while his poetic contemporary fled from an unhappy affair further south. It's also likely that Byron would have approved of the attitude to life here. Germany's most famous port brings with it sin, colour and open-mindedness: the infamous Reeperbahn offers every kind of sexual peccadillo known to mankind, including some new ones made possible by the wonders of medical science. The St Pauli port area retains a sense of well-mannered bohemianism: everyone cycles, the waterside bars and restaurants keep going throughout the night, and the Sunday morning Fischmarkt is like a medieval fayre, with traders of every description trying to out-shout one another in order to hawk their disparate wares. Little of the Hamburg of Byron's time remains - a great fire in 1842 and British bombs in 1943 razed the city twice over - but it has been reconstructed in a variety of neos - romanesque, gothic, classical - and now has a traditionalism infused with an embracing of the modern age. From the baroque splendour of the Hotel Atlantic by the Alstadt lake to the proud industrial harshness of the warehouse district, a trade area that has been Customs exempt from 1189, Hamburg has the kind of civilised eclecticism that Byron fled to Europe to immerse himself in. It was time to retrace the steps of Childe Harold. The first mention of the Rhineland in the epic poem is \"The Castle Crag of Drachenfells\" that \"frowns oe'r the wide and winding Rhine\".

      "body": "<p>Business before pleasure. That's the reputation Turin has earned with its industry over the years. Milan has couture, Florence culture, Venice canals and Turin has, well, cars and a shroud. </p> <p>But it shouldn't take a leap of faith to believe that you can have a good time in Turin - it's an Italian city after all, and so well versed in the finer things in life. In fact, it wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that Turin has made pleasure its business. And because of that, it's the perfect place for an indulgent weekend.</p> <p>A quick glance at a menu will tell you that many of the ingredients are local: barolo, barbera and barbaresco wine, porcini mushrooms and truffles. The aperitif was born here with vermouth (Martini and Cinzano are made nearby), the breadstick (grissino) was invented here, as was zabaglione, ice cream on a stick and a gourmet chocolate they call giandujotto.</p> <p>There's no shortage of places in which to indulge yourself either - 800 restaurants to be precise, ranging from the gilt-laden Ristorante del Cambio to the city's famous art-deco caf\u00e9s and pastry shops, elegant confections of marble, iron and glass such as Baratti &amp; Milano. </p> <p>An espresso will cost 50p standing at the bar; a nice lunch with a glass of local wine will set you back less than a tenner; a double scoop of gelato around 70p; an aperitif \u00a32, which comes with free canapes (stuzzichini) during the cocktail hour (7.30pm-8.30pm); and dinner weighs in at anything from \u00a315 to \u00a340 a head. It's enough to tempt a saint.</p> <p>Of course, anyone who's seen the cult Michael Caine film The Italian Job will also know that the city centre is no eyesore despite the Fiat Group producing Fiat, Lancia and Alfa Romeo cars in Turin. The Italian Alps lend an unexpected drama that's echoed in the grandeur of the buildings. Take the lift to the observation deck of the imposing Mole Antonelliana tower, and you'll see a city laid out before you on a grid system that's easy on the eye and easy to explore by foot. Its broad squares are lined with fine baroque and art-nouveau architecture, and the long, arcaded walkways of Via Po and Via Roma are wide enough to drive a Mini down.</p> <p>In the late 60s, when The Italian Job was filmed, the amount of traffic clogging the Piazza Castello, the main square and the hub of the city, was enough to inspire the plot of \"a smash-and-grab raid and $4 million through a traffic jam\". These days, it is pedestrianised and much of the city is being restored in preparation for when Turin hosts the Olympic Winter Games in 2006, and those long-awaited tourists finally start to arrive. </p> <p>Even the old Fiat factory, a couple of miles out of the centre at Lingotto, has been transformed - award-winning architect Renzo Piano converting the 20s site into a hotel, Le Meridien Lingotto, a conference centre, shopping arcade and an auditorium.</p> <p>At night, you can catch a classical concert there or an opera at Teatro Regio. And you can snatch glimpses of frescoed ceilings through half-drawn curtains as you wend your way down to the fashionable Murazzi district to enjoy an aperitif and a romantic meal overlooking the river Po.</p> <p>At times, it can be like walking through a living museum. There's Palazzo Reale, the Royal House of Savoy, built when Turin was the first capital after the unification of Italy in 1861. And the monumental Palazzo Carignano and Palazzo Madama. Classic stuff. Then there's Guarino Guarini's Chapel of the Holy Shroud in the baroque Duomo di San Giovanni, which houses one of the most talked about pieces of cloth in history. Actually, the chapel's still undergoing restoration after a fire in 1997. And the Holy Shroud has only been seen by the public five times since it arrived in the city in 1694; the one that's on permanent display is a photographic copy, because prolonged exposure to light would damage the original image of a man's body, believed to be Christ's.</p> <p>After the shroud, the second most popular attraction in Turin is, bizarrely, the Egyptian Museum, which claims to have the most complete collection of artefacts outside Cairo. A further claim is that the Italian film industry was born here, and the recently-restored Mole Antonelliana - originally conceived as a synagogue - is now a shrine to the silver screen in the form of the National Museum of the Cinema.</p> <p>And let's not forget that the Federazione Italiana del Football was founded in Turin on March 15 1898. Since then the city's two teams, Torino and Juventus, who share the ultra-modern Stadio Delle Alpi, have enjoyed varying fortunes, Juve now being the Serie A draw. It was here, on July 4 1990, that England went out to Germany on penalties in the semi-final of the World Cup. But try not to hold that against Turin.</p> <p><strong>Where to eat</strong> <br>The city is rightly famed for its ornate and elegant caf\u00e9s, and these are the best places to lunch on local dishes such as agnolotti - a ravioli-like pasta filled with meat and red wine sauce; risotto allarneis with wine sauce; bagnacauda, a version of fondue (vegetables are dipped in a sauce of garlic, anchovies, butter and milk); and hazelnut, chocolate and vanilla gelati. <br>\u0095 Baratti &amp; Milano, Piazza Castello 29 <br>Art-nouveau jewel set in the stunning Galleria Subalpina, an iron- and glass-roofed arcade. All wood panelling, big mirrors and chandeliers. There's a bar laden with jars of giandujotto chocolates and crystallised violets. <br>\u0095 Caff\u00e9 Torino, Piazza San Carlo 204 <br>In the portico of the square known as the \"living room\" of Turin because everybody passes through it. Favourite of Ava Gardner, James Stewart and Brigitte Bardot when they were in town. An ode to good taste. <br>\u0095 Caff\u00e9 Platti, Corso Vittorio Emanuele II, 72 <br>Magnificent interior and good local Langhe salad of mixed leaves, toma cheese, celery, walnuts, olive oil and lemon for \u00a34. Also good house aperitif, Platti Rosa. Once the haunt of Giovanni Agnelli, founder of Fiat. <br>\u0095 Ristorante Del Cambio, Piazza Carignano 2 Classic Piedmontese cuisine in a baroque setting. Crimson velvet drapes, chandeliers and gilt mirrors. Established 1757. \u00a340 a head with wine. <br>\u0095 Caff\u00e9 Tabac, Murazzi del Po 3 <br>In one of the arches of Murazzi along the banks of the Po, with a terrace for alfresco dining. </p> <p><strong>Aperitifs</strong> <br>\u0095 Mulassano, Piazza Castello 15 <br>Art-nouveau bar with marble, wood and bronze fittings and a tooled leather ceiling. Favourite of actors, directors and singers from nearby Teatro Regio and a good pre- or post-theatre bet. <br>\u0095 Caff\u00e9 Roberto, Via Po 5 <br>Good for snacks and happy hour. <br>\u0095 Achille Caff\u00e9, Via Carlo Alberto 12 <br>Good buffet of free canapes and reasonable aperitifs for \u00a32.</p> <p><strong>Late-night bar</strong> <br> Societe Lut\u00e8ce Bar, Piazza Carlo Emanuele <br>Hip little bar in renovated area, where a margarita will set you back \u00a34.</p> <p><strong>Coffee houses</strong> <br>\u0095 San Tomasso, Via San Tomasso 10 <br>Open 8.30am-3pm, 8pm-midnight. Lavazza coffee was created here in 1895. Restored in the deco style, it reopened four years ago with classic advertising memorabilia, including posters from the latest Lavazza campaign with Bond girl, Maria Grazia Cucinotta. <br>\u0095Al Bicerin, Piazza della Consolata 5 <br>Opened in 1763, a single, snug room with wooden walls and white marble tables that sells bicerin - a thick, sweet drink with the consistency of bitumen but actually made from hot coffee and drinking chocolate with a topping of cream. Regulars were Nietzsche and writer Italo Calvino.</p> <p><strong>Chocolates</strong> <br>\u0095Laboratorio Artigianale del Giandujotto, Via Cagliari 15A, Tel: + 39 11 2476245 <br>Like Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory; you can buy seven types of the famous giandujotto chocolates much cheaper (500g of the classic variety for \u00a35; at the airport, 300g will set you back \u00a38), and, if you phone in advance, you can watch them being made in traditional machines with stone grinders for the famous local tonda gentile delle Langhe hazelnut.</p> <p><strong>Ice cream</strong> <br>You can't go to Italy and not have an ice cream. <br>\u0095Gelati Pepino, Piazza Carignano 8 <br>The most famous parlour in Turin. Twenty flavours, but the classic is pinguino: white ice cream covered with chocolate.</p> <p><strong>Shopping</strong> <br>\u0095 Porto Palazza, Piazza della Repubblica <br>Europe's biggest open-air market. Open all morning on weekdays and all day Saturday, you can pick up handfuls of fresh basil for a song, porcini mushrooms for a fraction of the UK price. I bought a lump of parmegiano reggiano for \u00a32.50 and a cool coffee percolator for \u00a313. Just behind is the Bal\u00f4n flea market and, on the second Sunday of every month, the Gran Bal\u00f4n ideals in curios and antiques. <br>\u0095Under the portico of Via Roma for designer clothes (Herm\u00e8s, Fendi), and Galleria San Federico (Versace); more affordable options in Via Garibaldi; boutiques, delis and curiosities in Via Mercanti and the surrounding streets.</p> <p><strong>Football</strong> <br>\u0095 Stadio Delle Alpi, Strada Altessano 131, Torino, tel: +39 011 3290088. <br>Designed and built for the 1990 World Cup. <br>\u0095 Juventus.

Alternatively, Travelscene specialist sales (020-8861 6566) can organise tickets for Juventus and Torino football matches.</p> <p><strong>Museums</strong> <br>The Torino Card costs L21,000 (\u00a37) lasts two days and allows free entry to some of Turin's 38 museums and reduced ticket prices to a number of musical shows and plays.

      "bodyText": "Business before pleasure. That's the reputation Turin has earned with its industry over the years. Milan has couture, Florence culture, Venice canals and Turin has, well, cars and a shroud. But it shouldn't take a leap of faith to believe that you can have a good time in Turin - it's an Italian city after all, and so well versed in the finer things in life. In fact, it wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that Turin has made pleasure its business. And because of that, it's the perfect place for an indulgent weekend. A quick glance at a menu will tell you that many of the ingredients are local: barolo, barbera and barbaresco wine, porcini mushrooms and truffles. The aperitif was born here with vermouth (Martini and Cinzano are made nearby), the breadstick (grissino) was invented here, as was zabaglione, ice cream on a stick and a gourmet chocolate they call giandujotto. There's no shortage of places in which to indulge yourself either - 800 restaurants to be precise, ranging from the gilt-laden Ristorante del Cambio to the city's famous art-deco caf\u00e9s and pastry shops, elegant confections of marble, iron and glass such as Baratti &amp; Milano. An espresso will cost 50p standing at the bar; a nice lunch with a glass of local wine will set you back less than a tenner; a double scoop of gelato around 70p; an aperitif \u00a32, which comes with free canapes (stuzzichini) during the cocktail hour (7.30pm-8.30pm); and dinner weighs in at anything from \u00a315 to \u00a340 a head. It's enough to tempt a saint. Of course, anyone who's seen the cult Michael Caine film The Italian Job will also know that the city centre is no eyesore despite the Fiat Group producing Fiat, Lancia and Alfa Romeo cars in Turin. The Italian Alps lend an unexpected drama that's echoed in the grandeur of the buildings. Take the lift to the observation deck of the imposing Mole Antonelliana tower, and you'll see a city laid out before you on a grid system that's easy on the eye and easy to explore by foot. Its broad squares are lined with fine baroque and art-nouveau architecture, and the long, arcaded walkways of Via Po and Via Roma are wide enough to drive a Mini down. In the late 60s, when The Italian Job was filmed, the amount of traffic clogging the Piazza Castello, the main square and the hub of the city, was enough to inspire the plot of \"a smash-and-grab raid and $4 million through a traffic jam\". These days, it is pedestrianised and much of the city is being restored in preparation for when Turin hosts the Olympic Winter Games in 2006, and those long-awaited tourists finally start to arrive. Even the old Fiat factory, a couple of miles out of the centre at Lingotto, has been transformed - award-winning architect Renzo Piano converting the 20s site into a hotel, Le Meridien Lingotto, a conference centre, shopping arcade and an auditorium. At night, you can catch a classical concert there or an opera at Teatro Regio. And you can snatch glimpses of frescoed ceilings through half-drawn curtains as you wend your way down to the fashionable Murazzi district to enjoy an aperitif and a romantic meal overlooking the river Po. At times, it can be like walking through a living museum. There's Palazzo Reale, the Royal House of Savoy, built when Turin was the first capital after the unification of Italy in 1861. And the monumental Palazzo Carignano and Palazzo Madama. Classic stuff. Then there's Guarino Guarini's Chapel of the Holy Shroud in the baroque Duomo di San Giovanni, which houses one of the most talked about pieces of cloth in history. Actually, the chapel's still undergoing restoration after a fire in 1997. And the Holy Shroud has only been seen by the public five times since it arrived in the city in 1694; the one that's on permanent display is a photographic copy, because prolonged exposure to light would damage the original image of a man's body, believed to be Christ's. After the shroud, the second most popular attraction in Turin is, bizarrely, the Egyptian Museum, which claims to have the most complete collection of artefacts outside Cairo. A further claim is that the Italian film industry was born here, and the recently-restored Mole Antonelliana - originally conceived as a synagogue - is now a shrine to the silver screen in the form of the National Museum of the Cinema. And let's not forget that the Federazione Italiana del Football was founded in Turin on March 15 1898. Since then the city's two teams, Torino and Juventus, who share the ultra-modern Stadio Delle Alpi, have enjoyed varying fortunes, Juve now being the Serie A draw. It was here, on July 4 1990, that England went out to Germany on penalties in the semi-final of the World Cup. But try not to hold that against Turin. Where to eat The city is rightly famed for its ornate and elegant caf\u00e9s, and these are the best places to lunch on local dishes such as agnolotti - a ravioli-like pasta filled with meat and red wine sauce; risotto allarneis with wine sauce; bagnacauda, a version of fondue (vegetables are dipped in a sauce of garlic, anchovies, butter and milk); and hazelnut, chocolate and vanilla gelati. \u0095 Baratti &amp; Milano, Piazza Castello 29 Art-nouveau jewel set in the stunning Galleria Subalpina, an iron- and glass-roofed arcade. All wood panelling, big mirrors and chandeliers. There's a bar laden with jars of giandujotto chocolates and crystallised violets. \u0095 Caff\u00e9 Torino, Piazza San Carlo 204 In the portico of the square known as the \"living room\" of Turin because everybody passes through it. Favourite of Ava Gardner, James Stewart and Brigitte Bardot when they were in town. An ode to good taste. \u0095 Caff\u00e9 Platti, Corso Vittorio Emanuele II, 72 Magnificent interior and good local Langhe salad of mixed leaves, toma cheese, celery, walnuts, olive oil and lemon for \u00a34. Also good house aperitif, Platti Rosa. Once the haunt of Giovanni Agnelli, founder of Fiat. \u0095 Ristorante Del Cambio, Piazza Carignano 2 Classic Piedmontese cuisine in a baroque setting. Crimson velvet drapes, chandeliers and gilt mirrors. Established 1757. \u00a340 a head with wine. \u0095 Caff\u00e9 Tabac, Murazzi del Po 3 In one of the arches of Murazzi along the banks of the Po, with a terrace for alfresco dining. Aperitifs \u0095 Mulassano, Piazza Castello 15 Art-nouveau bar with marble, wood and bronze fittings and a tooled leather ceiling. Favourite of actors, directors and singers from nearby Teatro Regio and a good pre- or post-theatre bet. \u0095 Caff\u00e9 Roberto, Via Po 5 Good for snacks and happy hour. \u0095 Achille Caff\u00e9, Via Carlo Alberto 12 Good buffet of free canapes and reasonable aperitifs for \u00a32. Late-night bar Societe Lut\u00e8ce Bar, Piazza Carlo Emanuele Hip little bar in renovated area, where a margarita will set you back \u00a34. Coffee houses \u0095 San Tomasso, Via San Tomasso 10 Open 8.30am-3pm, 8pm-midnight. Lavazza coffee was created here in 1895. Restored in the deco style, it reopened four years ago with classic advertising memorabilia, including posters from the latest Lavazza campaign with Bond girl, Maria Grazia Cucinotta. \u0095Al Bicerin, Piazza della Consolata 5 Opened in 1763, a single, snug room with wooden walls and white marble tables that sells bicerin - a thick, sweet drink with the consistency of bitumen but actually made from hot coffee and drinking chocolate with a topping of cream. Regulars were Nietzsche and writer Italo Calvino. Chocolates \u0095Laboratorio Artigianale del Giandujotto, Via Cagliari 15A, Tel: + 39 11 2476245 Like Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory; you can buy seven types of the famous giandujotto chocolates much cheaper (500g of the classic variety for \u00a35; at the airport, 300g will set you back \u00a38), and, if you phone in advance, you can watch them being made in traditional machines with stone grinders for the famous local tonda gentile delle Langhe hazelnut. Ice cream You can't go to Italy and not have an ice cream. \u0095Gelati Pepino, Piazza Carignano 8 The most famous parlour in Turin. Twenty flavours, but the classic is pinguino: white ice cream covered with chocolate. Shopping \u0095 Porto Palazza, Piazza della Repubblica Europe's biggest open-air market. Open all morning on weekdays and all day Saturday, you can pick up handfuls of fresh basil for a song, porcini mushrooms for a fraction of the UK price. I bought a lump of parmegiano reggiano for \u00a32.50 and a cool coffee percolator for \u00a313. Just behind is the Bal\u00f4n flea market and, on the second Sunday of every month, the Gran Bal\u00f4n ideals in curios and antiques. \u0095Under the portico of Via Roma for designer clothes (Herm\u00e8s, Fendi), and Galleria San Federico (Versace); more affordable options in Via Garibaldi; boutiques, delis and curiosities in Via Mercanti and the surrounding streets. Football \u0095 Stadio Delle Alpi, Strada Altessano 131, Torino, tel: +39 011 3290088. Designed and built for the 1990 World Cup. \u0095 Juventus. Ticket line: +39 011 65631 (juventus.com). Ticket prices from \u00a313-\u00a380. \u0095 Torino. Ticket line: +39 011 8396670, (toro.it). For Juventus, call a week in advance to check ticket availability and you can pay over the phone with a credit card. Alternatively, Travelscene specialist sales (020-8861 6566) can organise tickets for Juventus and Torino football matches.

      "body": "<p> 'Write as much as you can!! Write, write, write till your fingers break!\" This advice, which Anton Chekhov sent to Maria Kiselyova in a letter in 1886, was the motto by which he lived and worked. He was 26, and had already published over 400 short stories and vignettes in popular magazines, as well as two books of stories, with a third in the making. He had written his first series of plays including Fatherlessness, Diamond Cut Diamond, The Scythe Struck the Stone, The Clean-Shaven Secretary With the Pistol and The Nobleman (none of which have come down to us) and Platonov and On the High Road, and he was about to begin writing Ivanov, his first major theatrical success. </p> <p>Throughout this period Chekhov was also energetically studying medicine at Moscow University, from which he graduated in June 1884. The nameplate on the Chekhov family's door now read \"Dr AP Chekhov\". </p> <p>The stories and vignettes in my book, The Undiscovered Chekhov, are from this period, the most prolific of Chekhov's life. They are some of the works that helped make him a literary star and contributed to his receiving the Pushkin prize in 1888. The seven stories and vignettes that follow have never before been translated into English. </p> <p>For Chekhov, these early years were extremely difficult. The Russian literary giants of the 19th century - Tolstoy, Pushkin, Gogol, Turgenev and Dostoevsky - had all come from the nobility. Chekhov was the grandson of a serf. His father had run a ramshackle grocery store in Taganrog in southern Russia. When Chekhov was 16, his father went bankrupt and left town in a hurry. He took the whole family, including the two elder sons, with him to Moscow - everyone except young Anton, who was left destitute and penniless to fend for himself in Taganrog. </p> <p>As Chekhov wrote to his friend and publisher Suvorin many years later: \"What the aristocrat writers get for free from nature, intellectuals of lower birth have to pay for with their youth. Write a story of how a young man, the son of a serf, a former shopboy, choirboy, schoolboy and student, brought up to respect rank, to kiss priests' hands, and worship the thoughts of others, thankful for every piece of bread, whipped time and again, having to give lessons without galoshes, brawling, torturing animals, loving to eat at rich relatives' houses, needlessly hypocritical before God and man, merely from a sense of his own insignificance - write a story about how this young man squeezes the serf out of himself, drop by drop, and how waking up one bright morning this young man feels that in his veins there no longer flows the blood of a slave, but the blood of a real man.\" </p> <p>By the time the 19-year-old Chekhov rejoined his parents in Moscow three years later, having secured a scholarship to study at the university, the family was living in utter poverty in grimy basement lodgings in Grachyovka, one of Moscow's red-light districts. Anton immediately took charge and became the head and chief support of the family, a position he was to keep till the end of his life. His family nicknamed him \"Papa Antosha\". He was determined to succeed, and despite the harsh reality of his situation wrote to his cousin: \"I will make a fortune... that is as certain as that two and two make four.\" </p> <p>Chekhov began making his fortune by writing stories and vignettes for popular magazines in Moscow and St Petersburg. According to his younger brother, Michael, the moment the first instalment of Anton's scholarship arrived from Taganrog, he bought up all the magazines he could lay his hands on. He meticulously read through them to see what they were publishing, and then went to work. He sent in sharp, witty, innovative pieces which were published during 1881 in the Moscow humorous magazine Zritel (Spectator) and In Svet i Teni (Light and Shade). </p> <p>Chekhov's pieces came as a surprise to readers of the time, for whom a story was supposed to deal with significant issues and have a clear beginning, middle and end. It was also supposed to impart the author's ideals. Chekhov's stories veered from this norm. He signed his pieces \"Antosha\", \"Antosha Ch\", \"My brother's brother\", \"A man without a spleen\" and \"Chekhonte\" - the last a nickname coined for him by his former religion teacher at school, Father Pokrovsky. </p> <p>Chekhov's contemporaries described him roaming the streets, markets, taverns and brothels of Moscow, absorbing the colour and commotion of the city and working it into quick, vivid prose. His friend and fellow writer Vladimir Korolenko wrote in his memoirs that when asked how he wrote his stories, Chekhov laughed, snatched up the nearest object - an ashtray - and said that if Korolenko wanted a story called The Ashtray, he could have it the next morning. </p> <p>Soon Chekhov was writing at such a pace that he was paying family and friends 10 kopecks for story ideas and 20 kopecks for plot outlines. But making ends meet remained a major problem for him throughout the 1880s, and in letters to friends, he constantly laments his lack of money. In a letter to Suvorin in 1888, Chekhov wrote: \"I was terribly corrupted by the fact that I was born, grew up, studied, and began to write in a milieu in which money played a shockingly large role.\" </p> <p>As money began trickling in from the publication of his work, Chekhov managed to move his family to better lodgings - they were to move almost a dozen times during his student years. But as he had to share his cramped living space with his parents, siblings, lodgers, and a constant flow of visiting relatives, Chekhov's living and working conditions remained very difficult. </p> <p>\"In front of me sits my non- literary work, banging mercilessly at my conscience. In the next room a visiting relative's fledgling is bawling; in the other room, father is reading The Sealed Angel out loud to mother. Someone has wound up the phonograph, and La Belle H\u00e9l\u00e8ne is playing. I want to escape to the country, but it's one in the morning. Can you imagine more vile circumstances for a man of letters?\" </p> <p>Chekhov wrote this to his new friend and publisher, Nicholas Leikin, in August 1883. Leikin was the owner and editor of the popular humorous St Petersburg magazine Oskolki (Splinters), for which Chekhov was to write 162 pieces over the next couple of years. Leikin had been searching for an energetic writer who had a wild sense of humour and an innovative style - and, most importantly, who was a master of brevity. Chekhov was the ideal candidate. Oskolki had a strict editorial limit of 100 lines, which forced Chekhov to develop an inventive style concise enough to carry ideas within an extremely restrictive framework. He complained bitterly that he had to \"squeeze the very pith and essence\" out of his plots, but he readily complied, sending Leikin some of the most original writing of the time. Oskolki published everything from anecdotes, witty riddles and cartoons to intricate vignettes and stories. Chekhov took these forms and expanded them into new literary genres. In an early piece in Oskolki, The Cross (published in February 1883), Chekhov pokes a daring jab at the oppressive state censorship which had just been granted greater power after the assassination of Tsar Alexander II in March 1881. </p> <p>In The Cross, a poet enters a drawing room: \" 'Well,' the hostess says turning to him, 'how did your dear little poem do?' \" The guests hover about him, amazed and impressed that a poet should be awarded a cross for a poem. The angry poet holds up his manuscript for all to see, and the startled guests realise that the cross he was awarded is \"not the kind of cross you can pin on your lapel\" - it is the red ink cross of the state censor. His poem has been rejected. </p> <p>Like many of his contemporaries, Chekhov put a good deal of effort into eluding the censor. It was always uncertain what would manage to slip through and what would be prohibited. Almost a century has passed since Chekhov's death, and it is surprising that many of these early masterpieces have not been translated into English. As Chekhov specialist Julie de Sherbinin has pointed out: \"The gaps in English translation of his early work can be attributed to various factors: these stories were long considered products of an 'immature' writer, they are rich in colloquialisms and wordplay and thus are hard to translate, and they often depend on cultural context for their humour.\" </p> <p>Since Chekhov's death in 1904, there have been many translations of his other prose pieces. During the Bloomsbury years, Constance Garnett established his position as an international literary figure by publishing 17 volumes of her Chekhov translations - 201 stories. The quantity of Chekhov's work was so great that Garnett had to make a selection, and her selections have subsequently remained largely uncontested. Consecutive generations of Chekhov translators have not veered far from her choice of stories, only occasionally introducing new, untranslated material. </p> <p>In many of his letters throughout his life, Chekhov downplayed his stories, calling them \"little trifles\", even \"literary excrements\" that were written \"half-consciously\". He playfully confided that he wrote things off the cuff, as if he were eating blini [Russian pancakes]. \"I don't love money sufficiently for medicine, and I don't have enough passion, that is, talent, for literature.\" Chekhov's natural self-deprecation in talking about his work misled many who knew him and later most of his biographers; but there is evidence that behind closed doors, he was always a painstakingly careful writer. His friend Nikolai Yozhov, for instance, was both shocked and amazed to catch him one day transcribing a story by Tolstoy. Chekhov told him that he often did this, that it was just an exercise - he was rewriting the story, editing it down. (Yozhov was outraged.) Chekhov wrote in an earnest letter of advice to his older brother, Alexander, also a writer: \"Most important of all: keep watch, observe, huff and puff, rewrite everything five times, condensing and so on, always remembering that all of Petersburg follows the work of the Chekhov brothers!\" </p> <p>It is a widely accepted myth that Chekhov initially saw writing as the road to a quick rouble, that he spent the first part of his career as a hack writer for the gutter press, and that it was only in midlife that he miraculously found literature. A closer look at the quality of his early work refutes this. </p> <p>Thomas Mann, in an essay published in Sinn und Form (Sense and Form) in 1954, commemorating the 50th anniversary of Chekhov's death, was one of the first to point out that Chekhov's diffident public attitude towards his writing had misled subsequent generations into a distorted view of his work. \"In my eyes,\" Mann wrote, \"the reason Chekhov has to a large extent been undervalued in Europe and even in Russia is due to his extremely sober, critical, and sceptical stance towards himself, and the dissatisfaction with which he regarded his accomplishments - in short, his modesty. </p> <p>This modesty was an extremely appealing trait, but it was not designed to exact respect from the world and, one could say that it set the world a bad example. For, the view we have of ourselves is not without influence on the image that people have of us, and can taint that image and possibly adulterate it. Chekhov the short-story writer was convinced for far too long of his artistic unworthiness and the insignificance of his capabilities. It was only slowly and with great difficulty that he gained a modicum of belief in himself - the belief that is essential if others are to believe in us. To the end of his life, he showed no trace of the literary grand seigneur, and even less of the sage and prophet.\" </p> <p>Another important factor that led earlier generations of scholars to deprecate Chekhov's early work was his own selection of stories for the 10-volume Sobranie Sochinenii (Collected Works, 1899-1902). It was felt that the pieces Chekhov chose not to include were in his eyes not up to par. And until quite recently, general scholarly opinion agreed with him. Stories told in minimalist telegrams? Absurdist vignettes? How could one compare these wild pieces with the multilayered style of The Cherry Orchard or The Lady with the Lap Dog, a style that has served as a model for many writers of the 20th century? </p> <p> Scholars today are taking a broader view in assessing the scope of Chekhov's early work. Pieces until recently dismissed as \"scurrilous sketches\" and \"impenetrably vacuous balderdash\" are now viewed as important experimental works. Thomas Venclova, for instance, discusses Chekhov's early prose as a major precursor of the Russian absurdist writers of the late 1920s and Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco. </p> <p>My work on this book began two years ago in the Slavic and Baltic division of the New York public library. I was looking through a heavy bound volume of Budilnik issues from 1880. The magazines had a very progressive, almost late-Edwardian look, much like early issues of the British magazine Punch. The drawings were coloured, which surprised me, and after the middle of 1880, the lettering on the title pages was flushed with gold. Just as I was wondering how a fin-de-si\u00e8cle printer could have managed that, I noticed a short story signed \"A Chekhov\" - Alexander Chekhov, Anton's older brother. In the next few issues there were more \"A Chekhov\" signatures, and quite a few \"Arteopod,\" an alias Alexander often used. </p> <p>And then came the first stories by \"Antosha Chekhonte\" - Anton Chekhov. To my surprise, the New York Public Library has all the Moscow and St Petersburg magazines in which Chekhov was first published: Budilnik ( Alarm Clock ) , Strekoza (Dragonfly) and Oskolki. As I began reading Chekhov's early stories in context, a very different image of him jumped off the page. The initial picture in my mind of the sedate literary elder with monocle and cane (the picture of Chekhov used on most book covers) disappeared, and a younger, livelier, more energetic image of the writer took its place. </p> <p>I soon found that the New York public library has one of the world's best collections of turn-of-the-century and earlier Russian material. Some of its rare books are not even available in the Russian state library. It houses almost 400,000 books, manuscripts and periodicals, including volumes from the libraries of 26 members of the Romanov dynasty - some items dating back to the 14th century. Avrahm Yarmolinsky, a Chekhov scholar and translator, who served as head of the Slavic and Baltic division, had travelled to Russia during the 1920s and 30s, buying up the libraries of the Romanovs and the former aristocracy. It was quite an experience working on this book, surrounded by such imperial Russian treasures. </p> <p>The Undiscovered Chekhov brings to English-speaking readers a new body of Chekhov's work that deserves a wider audience. I chose these stories as representative pieces out of the large body of Chekhov's writing spanning the period from 1880 to 1887. His work from that time is largely unknown outside Russia. Without it, a full picture of Chekhov as a writer is impossible. In The Undiscovered Chekhov, exuberance and energy, but also the technique of a young writer of genius, are apparent. These are the stories that made Chekhov famous in his day. </p> <p> <strong> The Collection</strong> <br> A few days ago I went to visit my friend, a journalist by the name of Misha Kovrov. I found him sitting on the sofa, cleaning his nails and drinking tea. He offered me a cup. </p> <p>\"I never drink tea without some bread to chase it down with,\" I said. \"Will you give me some?\" </p> <p>\"Never! Were you a sworn enemy, I might serve you some bread, but a friend - never! </p> <p>\"That is odd. Why?\" </p> <p>\"I'll tell you why. Come over here.\" </p> <p>Misha took me over to his desk and pulled out a drawer. </p> <p>\"Take a look!\" </p> <p>I looked inside, but could not see anything worth mentioning. \"There's nothing in there. Just some dirt . . . nails, bits of rag, and a few odds and ends.\" </p> <p>\"That is precisely what I want you to take a look at! It has taken me 10 years to collect these nails, and bits of rag and string! This is a collection of extreme importance!\" </p> <p>Misha scooped up the rubbish and poured it on to a sheet of newspaper. </p> <p>\"Do you see this burnt match?\" he asked, pointing at an ordinary, slightly charred match end. \"This is a very interesting match. I came upon it last year in a bread roll, which I had bought at Sevastyanov's. I almost choked. Luckily my wife was at home and pounded my back till I spat it out, or else the match might well have stayed lodged in my throat. And take a look at this fingernail, or is it a toenail, do you think? Three years ago I found it in a sponge cake I had bought at Filippov's. </p> <p>Armless and legless though the sponge cake was, it did have nails - one of those tricks of nature! Ah, and this green piece of rag here I found five years ago in a sausage I bought at one of Moscow's best butchers. This dried-up cockroach was swimming in some cabbage soup I was eating at a railroad station buffet, and this nail I found in the meatball I was eating at that same buffet. That rat tail and this strip of morocco leather were both in the same loaf of bread I bought at Filippov's. This herring, of which now only the bone is left, my wife found in a cake that she was given on her name day. And this beast here, that goes by the name of bedbug, was brought to me in a mug of beer at a German beer hall. Ah, and this bird dropping I almost swallowed at a tavern while eating a fish pie. And so on, my dear fellow.\" </p> <p>\"What an extraordinary collection!\" </p> <p>\"Indeed. It only weighs about a pound and a half, and does not contain all the items that I have inadvertently swallowed and digested. I would say that I have swallowed a good five, six pounds' worth.\" </p> <p>Misha carefully picked up the newspaper, peered tenderly at his collection for a good minute, and then poured it back into the drawer. I picked up the cup, sipped at my tea, and refrained from asking him a second time to bring me some bread.</p> <p><strong>Advertisement</strong><br> No more fires!

      "bodyText": "'Write as much as you can!! Write, write, write till your fingers break!\" This advice, which Anton Chekhov sent to Maria Kiselyova in a letter in 1886, was the motto by which he lived and worked. He was 26, and had already published over 400 short stories and vignettes in popular magazines, as well as two books of stories, with a third in the making. He had written his first series of plays including Fatherlessness, Diamond Cut Diamond, The Scythe Struck the Stone, The Clean-Shaven Secretary With the Pistol and The Nobleman (none of which have come down to us) and Platonov and On the High Road, and he was about to begin writing Ivanov, his first major theatrical success. Throughout this period Chekhov was also energetically studying medicine at Moscow University, from which he graduated in June 1884. The nameplate on the Chekhov family's door now read \"Dr AP Chekhov\". The stories and vignettes in my book, The Undiscovered Chekhov, are from this period, the most prolific of Chekhov's life. They are some of the works that helped make him a literary star and contributed to his receiving the Pushkin prize in 1888. The seven stories and vignettes that follow have never before been translated into English. For Chekhov, these early years were extremely difficult. The Russian literary giants of the 19th century - Tolstoy, Pushkin, Gogol, Turgenev and Dostoevsky - had all come from the nobility. Chekhov was the grandson of a serf. His father had run a ramshackle grocery store in Taganrog in southern Russia. When Chekhov was 16, his father went bankrupt and left town in a hurry. He took the whole family, including the two elder sons, with him to Moscow - everyone except young Anton, who was left destitute and penniless to fend for himself in Taganrog. As Chekhov wrote to his friend and publisher Suvorin many years later: \"What the aristocrat writers get for free from nature, intellectuals of lower birth have to pay for with their youth. Write a story of how a young man, the son of a serf, a former shopboy, choirboy, schoolboy and student, brought up to respect rank, to kiss priests' hands, and worship the thoughts of others, thankful for every piece of bread, whipped time and again, having to give lessons without galoshes, brawling, torturing animals, loving to eat at rich relatives' houses, needlessly hypocritical before God and man, merely from a sense of his own insignificance - write a story about how this young man squeezes the serf out of himself, drop by drop, and how waking up one bright morning this young man feels that in his veins there no longer flows the blood of a slave, but the blood of a real man.\" By the time the 19-year-old Chekhov rejoined his parents in Moscow three years later, having secured a scholarship to study at the university, the family was living in utter poverty in grimy basement lodgings in Grachyovka, one of Moscow's red-light districts. Anton immediately took charge and became the head and chief support of the family, a position he was to keep till the end of his life. His family nicknamed him \"Papa Antosha\". He was determined to succeed, and despite the harsh reality of his situation wrote to his cousin: \"I will make a fortune... that is as certain as that two and two make four.\" Chekhov began making his fortune by writing stories and vignettes for popular magazines in Moscow and St Petersburg. According to his younger brother, Michael, the moment the first instalment of Anton's scholarship arrived from Taganrog, he bought up all the magazines he could lay his hands on. He meticulously read through them to see what they were publishing, and then went to work. He sent in sharp, witty, innovative pieces which were published during 1881 in the Moscow humorous magazine Zritel (Spectator) and In Svet i Teni (Light and Shade). Chekhov's pieces came as a surprise to readers of the time, for whom a story was supposed to deal with significant issues and have a clear beginning, middle and end. It was also supposed to impart the author's ideals. Chekhov's stories veered from this norm. He signed his pieces \"Antosha\", \"Antosha Ch\", \"My brother's brother\", \"A man without a spleen\" and \"Chekhonte\" - the last a nickname coined for him by his former religion teacher at school, Father Pokrovsky. Chekhov's contemporaries described him roaming the streets, markets, taverns and brothels of Moscow, absorbing the colour and commotion of the city and working it into quick, vivid prose. His friend and fellow writer Vladimir Korolenko wrote in his memoirs that when asked how he wrote his stories, Chekhov laughed, snatched up the nearest object - an ashtray - and said that if Korolenko wanted a story called The Ashtray, he could have it the next morning. Soon Chekhov was writing at such a pace that he was paying family and friends 10 kopecks for story ideas and 20 kopecks for plot outlines. But making ends meet remained a major problem for him throughout the 1880s, and in letters to friends, he constantly laments his lack of money. In a letter to Suvorin in 1888, Chekhov wrote: \"I was terribly corrupted by the fact that I was born, grew up, studied, and began to write in a milieu in which money played a shockingly large role.\" As money began trickling in from the publication of his work, Chekhov managed to move his family to better lodgings - they were to move almost a dozen times during his student years. But as he had to share his cramped living space with his parents, siblings, lodgers, and a constant flow of visiting relatives, Chekhov's living and working conditions remained very difficult. \"In front of me sits my non- literary work, banging mercilessly at my conscience. In the next room a visiting relative's fledgling is bawling; in the other room, father is reading The Sealed Angel out loud to mother. Someone has wound up the phonograph, and La Belle H\u00e9l\u00e8ne is playing. I want to escape to the country, but it's one in the morning. Can you imagine more vile circumstances for a man of letters?\" Chekhov wrote this to his new friend and publisher, Nicholas Leikin, in August 1883. Leikin was the owner and editor of the popular humorous St Petersburg magazine Oskolki (Splinters), for which Chekhov was to write 162 pieces over the next couple of years. Leikin had been searching for an energetic writer who had a wild sense of humour and an innovative style - and, most importantly, who was a master of brevity. Chekhov was the ideal candidate. Oskolki had a strict editorial limit of 100 lines, which forced Chekhov to develop an inventive style concise enough to carry ideas within an extremely restrictive framework. He complained bitterly that he had to \"squeeze the very pith and essence\" out of his plots, but he readily complied, sending Leikin some of the most original writing of the time. Oskolki published everything from anecdotes, witty riddles and cartoons to intricate vignettes and stories. Chekhov took these forms and expanded them into new literary genres. In an early piece in Oskolki, The Cross (published in February 1883), Chekhov pokes a daring jab at the oppressive state censorship which had just been granted greater power after the assassination of Tsar Alexander II in March 1881. In The Cross, a poet enters a drawing room: \" 'Well,' the hostess says turning to him, 'how did your dear little poem do?' \" The guests hover about him, amazed and impressed that a poet should be awarded a cross for a poem. The angry poet holds up his manuscript for all to see, and the startled guests realise that the cross he was awarded is \"not the kind of cross you can pin on your lapel\" - it is the red ink cross of the state censor. His poem has been rejected. Like many of his contemporaries, Chekhov put a good deal of effort into eluding the censor. It was always uncertain what would manage to slip through and what would be prohibited. Almost a century has passed since Chekhov's death, and it is surprising that many of these early masterpieces have not been translated into English. As Chekhov specialist Julie de Sherbinin has pointed out: \"The gaps in English translation of his early work can be attributed to various factors: these stories were long considered products of an 'immature' writer, they are rich in colloquialisms and wordplay and thus are hard to translate, and they often depend on cultural context for their humour.\" Since Chekhov's death in 1904, there have been many translations of his other prose pieces. During the Bloomsbury years, Constance Garnett established his position as an international literary figure by publishing 17 volumes of her Chekhov translations - 201 stories. The quantity of Chekhov's work was so great that Garnett had to make a selection, and her selections have subsequently remained largely uncontested. Consecutive generations of Chekhov translators have not veered far from her choice of stories, only occasionally introducing new, untranslated material. In many of his letters throughout his life, Chekhov downplayed his stories, calling them \"little trifles\", even \"literary excrements\" that were written \"half-consciously\". He playfully confided that he wrote things off the cuff, as if he were eating blini [Russian pancakes]. \"I don't love money sufficiently for medicine, and I don't have enough passion, that is, talent, for literature.\" Chekhov's natural self-deprecation in talking about his work misled many who knew him and later most of his biographers; but there is evidence that behind closed doors, he was always a painstakingly careful writer. His friend Nikolai Yozhov, for instance, was both shocked and amazed to catch him one day transcribing a story by Tolstoy. Chekhov told him that he often did this, that it was just an exercise - he was rewriting the story, editing it down. (Yozhov was outraged.) Chekhov wrote in an earnest letter of advice to his older brother, Alexander, also a writer: \"Most important of all: keep watch, observe, huff and puff, rewrite everything five times, condensing and so on, always remembering that all of Petersburg follows the work of the Chekhov brothers!\" It is a widely accepted myth that Chekhov initially saw writing as the road to a quick rouble, that he spent the first part of his career as a hack writer for the gutter press, and that it was only in midlife that he miraculously found literature. A closer look at the quality of his early work refutes this. Thomas Mann, in an essay published in Sinn und Form (Sense and Form) in 1954, commemorating the 50th anniversary of Chekhov's death, was one of the first to point out that Chekhov's diffident public attitude towards his writing had misled subsequent generations into a distorted view of his work. \"In my eyes,\" Mann wrote, \"the reason Chekhov has to a large extent been undervalued in Europe and even in Russia is due to his extremely sober, critical, and sceptical stance towards himself, and the dissatisfaction with which he regarded his accomplishments - in short, his modesty. This modesty was an extremely appealing trait, but it was not designed to exact respect from the world and, one could say that it set the world a bad example. For, the view we have of ourselves is not without influence on the image that people have of us, and can taint that image and possibly adulterate it. Chekhov the short-story writer was convinced for far too long of his artistic unworthiness and the insignificance of his capabilities. It was only slowly and with great difficulty that he gained a modicum of belief in himself - the belief that is essential if others are to believe in us. To the end of his life, he showed no trace of the literary grand seigneur, and even less of the sage and prophet.\" Another important factor that led earlier generations of scholars to deprecate Chekhov's early work was his own selection of stories for the 10-volume Sobranie Sochinenii (Collected Works, 1899-1902). It was felt that the pieces Chekhov chose not to include were in his eyes not up to par. And until quite recently, general scholarly opinion agreed with him. Stories told in minimalist telegrams? Absurdist vignettes? How could one compare these wild pieces with the multilayered style of The Cherry Orchard or The Lady with the Lap Dog, a style that has served as a model for many writers of the 20th century? Scholars today are taking a broader view in assessing the scope of Chekhov's early work. Pieces until recently dismissed as \"scurrilous sketches\" and \"impenetrably vacuous balderdash\" are now viewed as important experimental works. Thomas Venclova, for instance, discusses Chekhov's early prose as a major precursor of the Russian absurdist writers of the late 1920s and Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco. My work on this book began two years ago in the Slavic and Baltic division of the New York public library. I was looking through a heavy bound volume of Budilnik issues from 1880. The magazines had a very progressive, almost late-Edwardian look, much like early issues of the British magazine Punch. The drawings were coloured, which surprised me, and after the middle of 1880, the lettering on the title pages was flushed with gold. Just as I was wondering how a fin-de-si\u00e8cle printer could have managed that, I noticed a short story signed \"A Chekhov\" - Alexander Chekhov, Anton's older brother. In the next few issues there were more \"A Chekhov\" signatures, and quite a few \"Arteopod,\" an alias Alexander often used. And then came the first stories by \"Antosha Chekhonte\" - Anton Chekhov. To my surprise, the New York Public Library has all the Moscow and St Petersburg magazines in which Chekhov was first published: Budilnik ( Alarm Clock ) , Strekoza (Dragonfly) and Oskolki. As I began reading Chekhov's early stories in context, a very different image of him jumped off the page. The initial picture in my mind of the sedate literary elder with monocle and cane (the picture of Chekhov used on most book covers) disappeared, and a younger, livelier, more energetic image of the writer took its place. I soon found that the New York public library has one of the world's best collections of turn-of-the-century and earlier Russian material. Some of its rare books are not even available in the Russian state library. It houses almost 400,000 books, manuscripts and periodicals, including volumes from the libraries of 26 members of the Romanov dynasty - some items dating back to the 14th century. Avrahm Yarmolinsky, a Chekhov scholar and translator, who served as head of the Slavic and Baltic division, had travelled to Russia during the 1920s and 30s, buying up the libraries of the Romanovs and the former aristocracy. It was quite an experience working on this book, surrounded by such imperial Russian treasures. The Undiscovered Chekhov brings to English-speaking readers a new body of Chekhov's work that deserves a wider audience. I chose these stories as representative pieces out of the large body of Chekhov's writing spanning the period from 1880 to 1887. His work from that time is largely unknown outside Russia. Without it, a full picture of Chekhov as a writer is impossible. In The Undiscovered Chekhov, exuberance and energy, but also the technique of a young writer of genius, are apparent. These are the stories that made Chekhov famous in his day. The Collection A few days ago I went to visit my friend, a journalist by the name of Misha Kovrov. I found him sitting on the sofa, cleaning his nails and drinking tea. He offered me a cup. \"I never drink tea without some bread to chase it down with,\" I said. \"Will you give me some?\" \"Never! Were you a sworn enemy, I might serve you some bread, but a friend - never! \"That is odd. Why?\" \"I'll tell you why. Come over here.\" Misha took me over to his desk and pulled out a drawer. \"Take a look!\" I looked inside, but could not see anything worth mentioning. \"There's nothing in there. Just some dirt . . . nails, bits of rag, and a few odds and ends.\" \"That is precisely what I want you to take a look at! It has taken me 10 years to collect these nails, and bits of rag and string! This is a collection of extreme importance!\" Misha scooped up the rubbish and poured it on to a sheet of newspaper. \"Do you see this burnt match?\" he asked, pointing at an ordinary, slightly charred match end. \"This is a very interesting match. I came upon it last year in a bread roll, which I had bought at Sevastyanov's. I almost choked. Luckily my wife was at home and pounded my back till I spat it out, or else the match might well have stayed lodged in my throat. And take a look at this fingernail, or is it a toenail, do you think? Three years ago I found it in a sponge cake I had bought at Filippov's. Armless and legless though the sponge cake was, it did have nails - one of those tricks of nature! Ah, and this green piece of rag here I found five years ago in a sausage I bought at one of Moscow's best butchers. This dried-up cockroach was swimming in some cabbage soup I was eating at a railroad station buffet, and this nail I found in the meatball I was eating at that same buffet. That rat tail and this strip of morocco leather were both in the same loaf of bread I bought at Filippov's. This herring, of which now only the bone is left, my wife found in a cake that she was given on her name day. And this beast here, that goes by the name of bedbug, was brought to me in a mug of beer at a German beer hall. Ah, and this bird dropping I almost swallowed at a tavern while eating a fish pie. And so on, my dear fellow.\" \"What an extraordinary collection!\" \"Indeed. It only weighs about a pound and a half, and does not contain all the items that I have inadvertently swallowed and digested. I would say that I have swallowed a good five, six pounds' worth.\" Misha carefully picked up the newspaper, peered tenderly at his collection for a good minute, and then poured it back into the drawer. I picked up the cup, sipped at my tea, and refrained from asking him a second time to bring me some bread. Advertisement No more fires! The anti-combustion ointments of Babayev &amp; Gardyen are the glory of our times. The following data serves as proof of their ideal fire-inhibiting qualities. Lapshin, the matchstick magnate, has rubbed the ointment on his \"Swedish\" matches, which now, as we are all aware, will not light even when held over a burning flame. The wicks of Pushkarevsky lanterns are also dipped in this ointment. Theatre brokers, loan sharks, barristers from Iversk never light up with shame, and this only because they have been dipped in the Babayev &amp; Gardyen ointment.

Trickery: an extremely ancient joke In England, in olden times, criminals sentenced to death were given the right to sell their bodies while they were still alive to anatomists and physiologists.

You see, y'r honour, I am to be burned at the stake. Ho ho ho!\" Heights The Height of Gullibility In the town of T the other day, K, a local landowner, bigwig and wealthy family man, shot himself. The bullet was discharged into the mouth and lodged itself in the brain. The following letter was found in the unfortunate man's pocket: \"I have just read in the almanac that we are to expect a bad harvest this year. For me a bad harvest means bankruptcy. As I do not wish to live to see such shame come upon me, I prefer to take my own life, and wish that nobody be held responsible for my death.\" The Height of Inattentiveness It has been reported as a substantiated fact that the other day the following regrettable incident took place: Dr M, a celebrated surgeon, during an amputation in which both legs of a railroad switchman were to be removed, due to inattentiveness amputated one of his own legs, and that of his assistant. Both men received immediate medical treatment. The Height of Civility I am the son of a long line of highly esteemed civil servants, I read The Civilian every day, I dress in a civil fashion, and my darling Anyuta and I are bound together in a civil marriage. The Height of Loyalty We have been informed that recently one of the contributing editors of the Kiev Tattler, a certain Mr T, after reading some Moscow newspapers, began to doubt his political allegiance and carried out a search of his own premises.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>Frances Carey wants advice on driving to St Petersburg.</strong></p> <p>\u0095 I frequently travel independently to Russia. I always begin by asking friends in St Petersburg for an invitation, about six months in advance of the trip; then a visa from the Russian Embassy in London is available by post in about two weeks. I have driven there three times: the easiest route is by Scandinavian Seaways ferry to Gothenburg in Sweden and Silja Line ferry from Stockholm to Turku in Finland. You need separate car nsurance for Russia, arranged in advance from the Russian insurance company, Ingostrakh (their office in Helsinki is convenient for this, since they speak English and fax to Finland is more reliable than to Russia). </p> <p>If going there without friends to issue an invitation, you need to book with a company like Intourist who can get you into a hotel, motel or campsite. The Olgino motel/campsite is on the Finnish side of St Petersburg on the main road in. </p> <p>The roads from the border to St Petersburg are fairly good but they can be very rough within the city, especially when crossing tramlines. </p> <p>If flying, a cheaper alternative than going directly to St Petersburg is to fly Buzz to Helsinki (for about \u00a390 return) and then take the train (about \u00a360 return). Book a Buzz flight on the internet and train tickets are available in advance from Helsinki railway station, by telephone. Your arrival station Finlyandski Voksal has its own station for the metro - a very efficient way of getting around this beautiful city. <br>Terry Coles</p> <p>\u0095 My advice is to think very carefully about this. We travelled Fred Olsen line, Harwich to Oslo, and then drove across to Stockholm (easy in a full day) through very pleasant countryside and caught an overnight ferry to Turku. From there, we drove via Helsinki to the Russian border at Vyborg. Once through, it is a reasonable drive to St Petersburg (Turku to St Petersburg in one day, but don't stop in Helsinki if you want to arrive in daylight). Ferries also go direct to Sweden or you could drive from Calais via Denmark. However, ferry fares will be quite expensive. Independent travel in Russia, unless things have changed since our trip, is not easy. You will need special insurance, and petrol stations are few and far between - we were given a map with them marked out. Intourist caters for independent travellers. The border crossing was tricky; we had to empty the car of every item of luggage which was all searched and the car itself was examined in detail. This took two hours. </p> <p>But the reason why I would not attempt this trip now is crime. The road from the border to St Petersberg is notorious for robberies and on arrival at your destination your car will need to be in secure accommodation at all times - you cannot walk away from it unless it is guarded or in a special compound (western cars are a prime target, but even Russians remove their windscreen wipers and place them inside the car). It may be worth flying with your daughter to help carry the extra luggage needed and to settle her in, which may be a more practical solution than driving. <br>Gerry Mewton</p> <p><strong>Manju wants to know how he can meet like-minded people to travel with this summer as most of his friends cannot take the time off.</strong></p> <p>\u0095 I travelled in Iran in 1999 with an Australian guy I \"met\" via the Lonely Planet website (<a href=\"http://www.thorntree.lonelyplanet.com\" target=\"_new\"> thorntree.lonelyplanet.com</a>), and I wouldn't hesitate to do it again.

      "bodyText": "Frances Carey wants advice on driving to St Petersburg. \u0095 I frequently travel independently to Russia. I always begin by asking friends in St Petersburg for an invitation, about six months in advance of the trip; then a visa from the Russian Embassy in London is available by post in about two weeks. I have driven there three times: the easiest route is by Scandinavian Seaways ferry to Gothenburg in Sweden and Silja Line ferry from Stockholm to Turku in Finland. You need separate car nsurance for Russia, arranged in advance from the Russian insurance company, Ingostrakh (their office in Helsinki is convenient for this, since they speak English and fax to Finland is more reliable than to Russia). If going there without friends to issue an invitation, you need to book with a company like Intourist who can get you into a hotel, motel or campsite. The Olgino motel/campsite is on the Finnish side of St Petersburg on the main road in. The roads from the border to St Petersburg are fairly good but they can be very rough within the city, especially when crossing tramlines. If flying, a cheaper alternative than going directly to St Petersburg is to fly Buzz to Helsinki (for about \u00a390 return) and then take the train (about \u00a360 return). Book a Buzz flight on the internet and train tickets are available in advance from Helsinki railway station, by telephone. Your arrival station Finlyandski Voksal has its own station for the metro - a very efficient way of getting around this beautiful city. Terry Coles \u0095 My advice is to think very carefully about this. We travelled Fred Olsen line, Harwich to Oslo, and then drove across to Stockholm (easy in a full day) through very pleasant countryside and caught an overnight ferry to Turku. From there, we drove via Helsinki to the Russian border at Vyborg. Once through, it is a reasonable drive to St Petersburg (Turku to St Petersburg in one day, but don't stop in Helsinki if you want to arrive in daylight). Ferries also go direct to Sweden or you could drive from Calais via Denmark. However, ferry fares will be quite expensive. Independent travel in Russia, unless things have changed since our trip, is not easy. You will need special insurance, and petrol stations are few and far between - we were given a map with them marked out. Intourist caters for independent travellers. The border crossing was tricky; we had to empty the car of every item of luggage which was all searched and the car itself was examined in detail. This took two hours. But the reason why I would not attempt this trip now is crime. The road from the border to St Petersberg is notorious for robberies and on arrival at your destination your car will need to be in secure accommodation at all times - you cannot walk away from it unless it is guarded or in a special compound (western cars are a prime target, but even Russians remove their windscreen wipers and place them inside the car). It may be worth flying with your daughter to help carry the extra luggage needed and to settle her in, which may be a more practical solution than driving. Gerry Mewton Manju wants to know how he can meet like-minded people to travel with this summer as most of his friends cannot take the time off. \u0095 I travelled in Iran in 1999 with an Australian guy I \"met\" via the Lonely Planet website ( thorntree.lonelyplanet.com), and I wouldn't hesitate to do it again. Make sure you advertise well in advance so you have the chance to get to know the person a bit before the actual trip - you don't want any nasty surprises far from home.

      "body": "<p>A new group of officials are to be appointed to speed up investigations into allegations of abuse by teachers in an attempt to give staff more protection from false accusations.</p> <p>The move will be announced by David Blunkett, the education secretary, at the National Union of Teachers' conference in Cardiff today. He will also meet Marjorie Evans, the headteacher cleared of slapping a pupil after 18 months.</p> <p>Mr Blunkett is to appoint 25 coordinators in England at a cost of \u00a31.4m. They will start work in September.</p> <p>The officials will have no investigatory powers but will liaise with local education authorities, child protection committees, schools and governors to hurry cases along. They will offer advice but not take decisions on inquiries into abuse.</p> <p>The education secretary will also review the guidance given to governors about abuse cases. But he has ruled out giving accused teachers anonymity while their case is investigated - a demand to be made in a motion to the NUT conference tomorrow backed by Mrs Evans. \"We don't think that is a practical way forward,\" an education department spokesman said.</p> <p>Mr Blunkett wants the time taken to deal with abuse allegations to be reduced from around nine months to three months in all but the most complicated cases. He accepts some cases will take longer.</p> <p>\"We must protect innocent teachers as well as children and to do so we need cases to be dealt with quickly, fairly and consistently,\" he will say.</p> <p>\"A balance must be struck between protecting pupils and ensuring teachers do not have their careers smeared or damaged by false accusations. It is our duty to make sure that allegations are dealt with quickly so that innocent teachers can return to the classroom swiftly where they belong.</p> <p>\"Dealing with cases more quickly can benefit the victims of genuine abuse too as their anguished wait for justice is reduced.\" The advisers will be involved in all allegations of physical and sexual abuse.</p> <p>The National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers said it had dealt with 1,289 cases where pupils had accused staff of abuse over the past decade. Only 52 resulted in convictions against teachers. The number of allegations rose from 42 in 1991 to 159 in 2000. The NUT dealt with 160 cases of teachers being accused of abuse last year and the Association of Teachers and Lecturers an estimated 60-80.</p> <p>Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the NUT, said last night: \"Teachers around the country will be delighted at the prospect of any investigation being contained within three months. It would have prevented the nightmare Marj Evans went through.\"</p> <p>Mrs Evans went through two police investigations, a court case, and a long-running inquiry by school governors at St Mary's junior, Caldicot, Monmouthshire, before it was found that there was no case to answer. She returned to school on March 21. An education department spokesman said Mr Blunkett was pleased that her ordeal was over. The Welsh assembly has launched an inquiry into the case.</p> <p>The NUT, the largest teachers' union, is one of the bodies consulted by the government about protection for teachers.</p> <p>Yesterday Mr McAvoy backed the call to be made in tomorrow's motion for the pupil as well as the teacher to be suspended when an abuse allegation was made. The situation would be similar to workplace cases when both accuser and accused are suspended when allegations are made.</p> <p>\u0095 The NUT leadership last night urged leftwingers not to sabotage its united front against the government on working conditions. Its conference will tomorrow debate a joint motion agreed with three other teachers' bodies which demands an inquiry into pay and conditions.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A new group of officials are to be appointed to speed up investigations into allegations of abuse by teachers in an attempt to give staff more protection from false accusations. The move will be announced by David Blunkett, the education secretary, at the National Union of Teachers' conference in Cardiff today. He will also meet Marjorie Evans, the headteacher cleared of slapping a pupil after 18 months. Mr Blunkett is to appoint 25 coordinators in England at a cost of \u00a31.4m. They will start work in September. The officials will have no investigatory powers but will liaise with local education authorities, child protection committees, schools and governors to hurry cases along. They will offer advice but not take decisions on inquiries into abuse. The education secretary will also review the guidance given to governors about abuse cases. But he has ruled out giving accused teachers anonymity while their case is investigated - a demand to be made in a motion to the NUT conference tomorrow backed by Mrs Evans. \"We don't think that is a practical way forward,\" an education department spokesman said. Mr Blunkett wants the time taken to deal with abuse allegations to be reduced from around nine months to three months in all but the most complicated cases. He accepts some cases will take longer. \"We must protect innocent teachers as well as children and to do so we need cases to be dealt with quickly, fairly and consistently,\" he will say. \"A balance must be struck between protecting pupils and ensuring teachers do not have their careers smeared or damaged by false accusations. It is our duty to make sure that allegations are dealt with quickly so that innocent teachers can return to the classroom swiftly where they belong. \"Dealing with cases more quickly can benefit the victims of genuine abuse too as their anguished wait for justice is reduced.\" The advisers will be involved in all allegations of physical and sexual abuse. The National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers said it had dealt with 1,289 cases where pupils had accused staff of abuse over the past decade. Only 52 resulted in convictions against teachers. The number of allegations rose from 42 in 1991 to 159 in 2000. The NUT dealt with 160 cases of teachers being accused of abuse last year and the Association of Teachers and Lecturers an estimated 60-80. Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the NUT, said last night: \"Teachers around the country will be delighted at the prospect of any investigation being contained within three months. It would have prevented the nightmare Marj Evans went through.\" Mrs Evans went through two police investigations, a court case, and a long-running inquiry by school governors at St Mary's junior, Caldicot, Monmouthshire, before it was found that there was no case to answer. She returned to school on March 21. An education department spokesman said Mr Blunkett was pleased that her ordeal was over. The Welsh assembly has launched an inquiry into the case. The NUT, the largest teachers' union, is one of the bodies consulted by the government about protection for teachers. Yesterday Mr McAvoy backed the call to be made in tomorrow's motion for the pupil as well as the teacher to be suspended when an abuse allegation was made. The situation would be similar to workplace cases when both accuser and accused are suspended when allegations are made. \u0095 The NUT leadership last night urged leftwingers not to sabotage its united front against the government on working conditions. Its conference will tomorrow debate a joint motion agreed with three other teachers' bodies which demands an inquiry into pay and conditions.",

      "body": "<p>We all know the reader- annotated book of the present day, and we prefer not to think about it. It's a scruffy thing. Somebody has used a yellow highlighter to mark significant passages - most of the text, it seems. Perhaps it was the same person who scribbled some page numbers in ballpoint pen inside the back cover, with the odd word to show what subject the page numbers refer to, or who wrote a disparaging comment on the title page under the author's name. If it is a library book, there will be no way of telling who marked it up, but if it is private property, the owner's name will almost certainly be on the first blank page inside the cover. If it is left on a bus, nobody will carry it off: it is unlovable and unsaleable. </p> <p>On the other hand, the British Library in 1998 proudly announced the acquisition of its second copy of Galileo's work on sunspots, Istoria e Dimostrazioni Intorno alle Macchie Solari (Rome, 1613). A publicity leaflet describes it as follows: </p> <p>\"The special interest of this copy lies in the copious annotations in Italian which have been written in the margins throughout the book. While it is not known who wrote the annotations, there appear to be three different hands, all dating from the early 17th century. The annotations have not been transcribed or studied in any detail, but it is clear that they were written by contemporary readers who were interested in recent developments in astronomy and were competent enough to comment in detail on Galileo's observations and findings. These annotations are important evidence for the impact of Galileo's ideas on his contemporaries and give a glimpse of the excited interest and polemical discussion which Galileo's work often provoked.\" </p> <p>In this case, apparently, reader's notes increase the market value of the book. The library did not need another copy of that edition, rare and valuable though it might be. The notes are not Galileo's, nor does it contain even his autograph. The notes were written, so far as we know, not by some other famous person but by unidentified contemporaries of no guaranteed authority. In fact the notes have not been \"studied in any detail\", so we don't actually know yet what they contain, and it is possible that they are not original, perhaps not directly relevant to the text at hand. </p> <p>Nevertheless, they are valued as a contemporary response, and may be valued all the more, nowadays, for being the work of nameless readers. The same criteria could be applied to the book on the bus, but its annotations have negative value. How do we explain the discrepancy between worthless notes and priceless ones? </p> <p>About the time that the British Library displayed its Galileo, I picked through a batch of books rejected from a college book sale. There I found a paperback copy of a book by Joseph Fletcher called Situation Ethics: The New Morality (Philadelphia, 1966). All markings are in ballpoint ink. Inside the front cover are an address and two owners' names; the notes were written by the second of them. On the first page,the half-title, she has written, \"Criticism in bookstore by Ramsey\" - a reference for further reading. The first note occurs on page 19, where the word \"casuistry\" is underlined and a definition is given in the margin: \"study of right and wrong\". The reader, a student, appears to be conscientious enough to look up unfamiliar terms. At page 41, she begins cautiously to express her own opinions in reaction to the developing argument: \"Good\", she says. At page 55, she first registers disagreement, underlining the sentence, \"For the situationist there are no rules - none at all,\" and commenting, \"Don't agree. Should have some rules or could screw it all up.\" </p> <p>So the response continues, the comments being generally brief and, to be honest, banal. At the end of the index, the annotator sums up the volume in her own words: \"nothing is no-no - everything is relative in face of love - must love neighbour - only one absolute - love - idea of 'Summon bonum' - higher good - says must do things for the good - and could turn out bad as long as the goal is good then it's OK - the means to the end - feels there should be no laws - how could you bring children up that way?\" </p> <p>We have no way of knowing whether the notes in the Galileo are any more sophisticated than these. It is quite likely that they, too, are student's notes, and if we were in a position to compare them, we might be able to say something about changes in educational methods and results over time. This copy of Situation Ethics is not as uninformative as the book that contains nothing but underlining, nor as thrilling as a copy that provides privileged information or significant criticism. But it repays attention, and as time goes by its kind of record is likely to increase in value, if not in commercial terms, then at least in terms of potential use by the sociologist and cultural historian. </p> <p>Though the annotator herself can hardly have been aware of the fact, her annotations are consistent with centuries of tradition reaching back far beyond the birth of print, through the ages of manuscript culture. Methods of annotation are culturally transmitted by the usual mysterious means - for example, prohibition, or word of mouth. They are taken for granted as part of the common reading experience, and it looks as though they will continue to do so. Interactivity is in its heyday and the proponents of the electronic book seem to be keen to accommodate the desire of readers to be involved through annotation. </p> <p>The student copy of Situation Ethics illustrates a fact that many serious readers deplore: even when less invasive alternatives are available, people go on disfiguring books. Those same serious readers might be prepared to make an exception, though for marginalia associated with public figures. They would be stirred by the sight of the copy of Shakespeare that circulated among the prisoners at Robben Island in South Africa when Nelson Mandela was there. (The prisoners' custom was to sign their names at their favourite passages, and in 1977 Mandela chose Julius Caesar II ii 32-37: \"Cowards die many times before their deaths\", et seq.) They would understand the buzz over Marilyn Monroe's books in 1999, when some of her personal effects came up for sale. (The most telling was a copy of The Little Engine That Could containing \"childish pencil scrawls at the end\", possibly hers.) </p> <p>Books with marginalia often turn out to be a record of affection. Thomas Hardy and Mrs Hennicker exchanged notes in a book, and Mark Twain seems to have started off as a writer of marginalia by writing in books to amuse his fiancee. In the 1960s Philip Larkin, a librarian as well as a poet, enjoyed bawdily altering books with his companion, the academic Monica Jones, and Joe Orton and Kenneth Halliwell were convicted of defacing library books. </p> <p>Among writers known for their marginalia are Blake, Darwin, Macaulay and Walpole. It was as the editor of marginalia by ST Coleridge, who is associated with the popularisation of the genre, that I began to notice other reader's comments in books, and to collect them. Coleridge's friends encouraged his habit of writing comments in the margins of books. (He well understood the sentimental value of his notes. In Charles Lamb's copy of the plays of Beaumont and Fletcher, he wrote, \"I will not be long here, Charles! - &amp; gone you will not mind my having spoiled a book in order to leave a relic.\") From roughly 1807, when Coleridge was 35, the number of books that he freely annotated grew until he began to see this library as a marketable resource. One of Charles Lamb's best-known essays celebrated his skills as an annotator. Thomas De Quincy published some of the notes that Coleridge had written in books of his. In November 1819, Coleridge himself, under cover of an editorial fiction, published his \"marginalia\" on Sir Thomas Browne in Blackwoods' Magazine, bringing the word marginalia from Latin into English. </p> <p>Ultimately, the future of marginalia rests with readers, and to readers I say (with William Blake): throw off the mind-forged manacles and take a pencil to your books. It is difficult to think of any value attached to books that is not increased by the addition of notes. If it is only by the souvenir value of a presentation inscription, notes personalise our books. (A surprising but charming case is the copy of Kenneth Burke's Grammar of Motives in the Beinecke Library, autographed in ballpoint by Burke and a group of friends to celebrate a party in August 1965. One of them, Robert Osborn, added a drawing with a caption, \" The man who, at that splendid luncheon party, juggled 8 balls including his own\"). </p> <p>Methodical dating and indexing can create a convenient reading record and filing system. Minute criticism in the margins at the very least allows a reader to let off steam; at its best, it is a vital part of the process by which the reader works out an independent position. For my money, annotating books is more profitable and less narcissistic exercise than keeping a diary. And it increases our satisfaction in our books if we know that they contain useful supplementary materials and better or fuller information than that found in other copies. </p> <p>\u0095 This is an edited extract from Marginalia: Readers Writing in Books by HJ Jackson (Yale University Press, \u00a319.95).

      "body": "<p>It is now a commonplace that some time during the 19th century, the study of science became so complex and specialised that the interested general reader has been effectively excluded from its debates ever since. But no one seems to have told John Gribbin. In the last 30 years he has produced more than 50 books and thousands of articles on cutting-edge contemporary science, all written in a language that the fabled interested general reader has at least an even chance of understanding. </p> <p>While Gribbin does have a scientific background, he says: \"I'm not a scientist who writes. I regard myself as a writer who happens to write about science.\" He takes the Isaac Asimov definition of an expert - \"I'm an expert in only one thing: sounding like an expert\" - and on this basis has plunged into the latest developments in the studies of climatic change, the search for extra-terrestrial life, quantum mechanics, string theory and the search for human origins. Books like Almost Everyone's Guide to Science and his Companion to the Cosmos have provided lucid overviews, while the likes of In Search of Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat have dug pretty deeply into more specialised fields, in that case quantum physics. </p> <p>Gribbin says that the recent boom in science publishing was launched by the success of Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time but might now have passed its peak. \"I suspect history has taken over in the last year or so.\" But he knows there is still a large market out there keen for news from the lab, and he thanks the British education system for giving him the skills to be able to speak to it. </p> <p>\"In the 1950s and 1960s you would learn a lot about some subject and then sit down and do an exam. I was very good at this sort of pr\u00e9cis, and my writing career since has been similar in that I often write short things about other people's work and try to boil quite complex things down to their essence.\" </p> <p>After leaving school, his maths wasn't good enough for him to be a physicist, so he enrolled as one of the first students on the MSc astronomy course at Sussex university, where he is now a visiting fellow. \"Astronomy is probably the most general area of science that it is possible to work in,\" he says. After completing his PhD at Cambridge, he hoped to get a job in the discipline, \"but things were very tight at the beginning of the 1970s and I got into writing.\" A fellow PhD student had been writing for New Scientist and suggested Gribbin should do the same. \"I ended up entirely funding the last year of my PhD from journalism, and so it was the obvious place to go as a second-choice career. I've never sat down and said 'I want to be a writer', but equally I can never remember a time when I wasn't one.\" </p> <p>As a journalist he wrote five or six science news stories a week, \"on every topic under the sun\", and then naturally gravitated into books. His most recent entirely new work was last year's Stardust , in which he dealt with the cosmic aspects of human origins. He points out that the four most common elements that actually react to anything in the universe - carbon, hydrogen , oxygen and nitrogen - are also the four most common elements of our bodies. \"The analogy I use is that in the polar regions people make houses out of ice, and in warmer parts of the world they use mud because that is what is available. Life is made of these four elements because that is what is available, which leads me to say that it is very likely that life is common. Of course, that doesn't mean there is intelligent life elsewhere. That is another big step and is an unresolved question.\" </p> <p>While his work in this area is strictly scientifically accurate, he has also dabbled in science fiction. \"I always preferred hard SF writers like Arthur Clarke and Asimov, who dealt with real science extrapolated to the future, rather than fantasy.\" His fiction career ended when \"suddenly people stopped buying the books. So I thought: 'Sod that, I'll go back to what I know will sell.' My agent was delighted because he always thought it was a waste of time, but it was immensely valuable to my development as a non-fiction writer. I learned about characterisation and plot development and building to some sort of climax and all that. My non-fiction writing did improve.\" </p> <p>His latest book, The First Chimpanzee , is a good example of his approach to topical scientific developments. It is an update of his 1982 book, The Monkey Puzzle , written with Jeremy Cherfas. Gribbin was intrigued by research that implied our relationship to chimpanzees and gorillas was closer than had been previously thought. The scientific establishment was dismissive, but as time has gone on Gribbin says the new view, \"while not exactly becoming respectable, did become less disreputable\". Then, a couple of years ago, \"some superb and very rigorous research was done in Australia which produced some rock-solid data. This time it got headlines, so it was time to bring the story up to date.\" </p> <p>Is there an evangelical impulse to his work? \"I think so,\" he says. \"I do care about people being informed and encouraged to take an interest in science. It's important. One of the really nice things about my career is that people who have done degrees have come to me and said that they started doing physics or something because they read one of my books.

It is decorously relegated to a footnote in six-point type, but will be read with glee by his detractors. People familiar with the Confederation of British Industry, he says, \"will wonder, in reading this chapter, whether I am not attacking some of the very language which was used by it when I was its Director-General\". </p> <p>Indeed they might. The first third of the book is a sustained polemic against the myth of competitiveness when applied to the nation state. The arguments that lie behind the notion that nation states compete with each other, and that Europe is suffering from a failure of competitiveness vis-\u00e0-vis the United States, are \"confused in theory, wrong in empirical description of the world economy, and wrong in their description of the causes of European unemployment\". Apart from that, the competitiveness industry has a lot going for it. </p> <p>As the man who handed the CBI to Turner in 1995 when, he ambiguously acknowledges, it \"had carved out a name for itself as an advocate of competitiveness\", I take a personal interest in this recantation. And I am forced to accept that he makes his case powerfully against the strong-form exponents of competitiveness theory. It is economic nonsense to suggest that nations are engaged in a kind of mercantilist fight to the death. The argument that, faced with the imperatives of globalisation, countries have no choice but to cut spending, taxes and all forms of labour-market regulation is evidently untrue. So is the notion that the US strain of capitalism is unambiguously superior to all others. </p> <p>My own defence of the use of competitiveness as a policy lever - half-shared by Turner - is that it can help to force otherwise desirable measures of liberalisation and fiscal discipline. Domingo Cavallo introduced a so-called competitiveness package recently in Argentina, designed to achieve just the sort of macro-economic stability that is the underpinning of all the policy prescriptions in Just Capital . And while Turner cannot resist taking aim at those, like William Hague and the Eurosceptic press, who harness bogus competition arguments to their cause, his principal objective is altogether grander. He aims first to assess the reasons for the different economic records of different brands of capitalism; North American, Rhineland and Lombard Street. Then, heroically, he tries to articulate his own model of the liberal economy. </p> <p>This a high ambition for a book targeted at the general reader. Yet it is no exaggeration to say that he succeeds triumphantly. I have read no better assessment of the relative performance of the UK, continental Europe and the US. Turner demonstrates that while the US record of absolute growth and employment creation has been superior in recent years, European productivity per hour remains appreciably higher. While the UK has caught up a little with France and Germany over the last two decades, the catch-up has been slow: a superior per capita growth rate of only around 0.15% a year. </p> <p>Turner convincingly demonstrates that there is no relationship whatsoever between the level of taxation and public spending, and economic growth. His key message is that governments, and their electors, still have important choices to make, and that there is no inevitability about lower taxes and lower public expenditure. Tax systems need to be constructed with care, and some forms of labour-market regulation (notably high minimum wages) are dangerous. But if a developed country wishes to spend more on education, healthcare or the transport infrastructure, it is able to do so without seeing its productive base float offshore. </p> <p>There are, however, some policy prescriptions that are unambiguously positive: macro-economic stability with low inflation, a robust domestic competition regime, and as much exposure to external competition as possible. He sees the UK's major post-war policy error as our delayed decision to join the common market. And the single currency now scores highly as a measure that would improve the micro-economy and promote macro-stability. </p> <p>Turner's muscular style will win him few friends among those at whose confused thinking he takes aim. His last chapter is particularly pungent. In it he explores the dangerous vacuities of stakeholder capitalism and the paradox of the third way - \"an unwillingness to say bluntly that one purpose of taxes is to support redistribution, matched by fuzzy talk of communities, stakeholders and social responsibility\". Why not, instead, straightforwardly espouse a policy of \"redistributive market liberalism\", which at least benefits from a clear intellectual rationale, persuasively set out here? </p> <p>As politicians of all parties, and the pundits who follow them, contemplate a month of phony war before the real hostilities begin, they could usefully spend a day or two with Just Capital . No other book would do so much to improve the quality of debate on the economic and social questions at issue in the next election.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Spring is the time when students start to look for the home that will see them through the next academic year, and when more affluent parents start doing their maths: does it pay to buy a house for their son or daughter rather than shelling out rent money? </p> <p>Parents don't even need to be that affluent; lenders which only five years ago were hostile to the lettings market are now falling over themselves to hand out buy-to-let mortgages, some on rates as low as 6% with only small deposits demanded. </p> <p>But is it worth it, especially after the steep increase in property prices over the past three years? Jobs &amp; Money this week carried out a snapshot survey in the big university cities and found that in many cases the answer is yes, although sky-high prices in London, Brighton, Oxford and Cambridge are making the equation far less comfortable than before. </p> <p>All the estate agents we contacted reported a surge in parents asking for details on property - usually three- or four-bed terraces and semis - for their son or daughter to share with friends, with Nottingham seeing the most activity. </p> <p>The agents say it is also the time of the year when they see their unlikeliest customers. Minutes after nipping in to Poundstretcher to pick up a \u00a32 saucepan, the Oxfam and Firetrap-clad student nervously steps through the doors of an estate agency and asks for details on \u00a3100,000 houses. </p> <p>\"In the past couple of weeks we have had them pouring in,\" says Nottingham estate agent Jennifer Will of Paul Davey &amp; Co. </p> <p>Competition from professional landlords combined with the surge in student numbers has sent prices spiralling in what were previously undesirable student areas. Lenton in Nottingham, Jesmond in Newcastle, Headingley in Leeds and the Unthank Road area in Norwich have all seen the price of terraced housing jump through the \u00a3100,000 barrier, deterring most parental buyers. </p> <p>Estate agents say they have to continuously deflate the price expectations of parents from the south of England, who have read too many property stories about \u00a310,000 terraces in places such as Salford. </p> <p>In Sheffield, estate agent Nicola Spencer says: \"Londoners have no idea about house prices in the north. They ring up and say they want a three-bed house in a good area for \u00a330,000. They come up here all wanting a bargain and want to get something as cheap as chips.\" Most are let down when she tells them typical three-bed houses in Sheffield sell for \u00a385,000-\u00a3125,000. </p> <p>Competition for property close to universities is fierce. Ms Spencer recently saw 11 buyers compete for a two-bed flat minutes from Sheffield University put on the market for \u00a357,950; it sold last week to a parent who paid \u00a370,000 in cash. </p> <p>Other areas are witnessing over-supply, as landlords lured by big yields - often 10% or more - have invested heavily in property at the same time as some universities and housing associations have constructed new student accommodation blocks. Connell Estate Agents in Exeter says over-supply has resulted in rental properties further out of town remaining empty, while in Sheffield new student accommodation is making students picky about going more than a mile out of the city centre in search of housing. Yet the figures still stack up for most big northern cities. The threshold is broadly where the annual income on the property (the yield) is more than 7%-8% of the property's value.

      "bodyText": "Spring is the time when students start to look for the home that will see them through the next academic year, and when more affluent parents start doing their maths: does it pay to buy a house for their son or daughter rather than shelling out rent money? Parents don't even need to be that affluent; lenders which only five years ago were hostile to the lettings market are now falling over themselves to hand out buy-to-let mortgages, some on rates as low as 6% with only small deposits demanded. But is it worth it, especially after the steep increase in property prices over the past three years? Jobs &amp; Money this week carried out a snapshot survey in the big university cities and found that in many cases the answer is yes, although sky-high prices in London, Brighton, Oxford and Cambridge are making the equation far less comfortable than before. All the estate agents we contacted reported a surge in parents asking for details on property - usually three- or four-bed terraces and semis - for their son or daughter to share with friends, with Nottingham seeing the most activity. The agents say it is also the time of the year when they see their unlikeliest customers. Minutes after nipping in to Poundstretcher to pick up a \u00a32 saucepan, the Oxfam and Firetrap-clad student nervously steps through the doors of an estate agency and asks for details on \u00a3100,000 houses. \"In the past couple of weeks we have had them pouring in,\" says Nottingham estate agent Jennifer Will of Paul Davey &amp; Co. Competition from professional landlords combined with the surge in student numbers has sent prices spiralling in what were previously undesirable student areas. Lenton in Nottingham, Jesmond in Newcastle, Headingley in Leeds and the Unthank Road area in Norwich have all seen the price of terraced housing jump through the \u00a3100,000 barrier, deterring most parental buyers. Estate agents say they have to continuously deflate the price expectations of parents from the south of England, who have read too many property stories about \u00a310,000 terraces in places such as Salford. In Sheffield, estate agent Nicola Spencer says: \"Londoners have no idea about house prices in the north. They ring up and say they want a three-bed house in a good area for \u00a330,000. They come up here all wanting a bargain and want to get something as cheap as chips.\" Most are let down when she tells them typical three-bed houses in Sheffield sell for \u00a385,000-\u00a3125,000. Competition for property close to universities is fierce. Ms Spencer recently saw 11 buyers compete for a two-bed flat minutes from Sheffield University put on the market for \u00a357,950; it sold last week to a parent who paid \u00a370,000 in cash. Other areas are witnessing over-supply, as landlords lured by big yields - often 10% or more - have invested heavily in property at the same time as some universities and housing associations have constructed new student accommodation blocks. Connell Estate Agents in Exeter says over-supply has resulted in rental properties further out of town remaining empty, while in Sheffield new student accommodation is making students picky about going more than a mile out of the city centre in search of housing. Yet the figures still stack up for most big northern cities. The threshold is broadly where the annual income on the property (the yield) is more than 7%-8% of the property's value. Yields of 15% can still be found in cities such as Leeds and Manchester, but in Oxford, Cambridge and Brighton they are 5% or below. In London they are even lower, and require that parents take on colossal loans. It is also partly due to the fact that student rents only poorly reflect house price variations; student rents in Brighton are only a quarter higher than Manchester, but house prices are double. Oxford and Cambridge are specialist markets; Julie Levitt of Allen &amp; Harris estate agents in Oxford says that it sells lots of buy-to-let properties to parents despite the low yield; rich parents are paying cash and see their return coming from future capital appreciation, rather than rental income. Buying a rental property has become much easier in recent years, not just because of the easing of mortgage restrictions; the Association of Residential Letting Agents says the market took off in the 90s because of the introduction of assured shorthold tenancies which has relieved landlords of the threat of unremovable tenants. The internet is also making remote buying easier through services such as rightmove.co.uk and assertahome.co.uk. But there are numerous downsides; the figures in our table assume rental income of 11 months a year. Letting agents caution against buyers over-optimistically assuming their property will be let all year round. Tenants are responsible for council tax, but the landlord is responsible when the property is vacant. Landlords should also factor in ground rent, water rates and any service charges.

But the agents were not members of the ombudsman for estate agents scheme so she could not turn to that for help. </p> <p>As Jobs and Money reported last week, there is mounting frustration about the failure of estate agents to join the voluntary ombudsman scheme. Nearly two-thirds of estate agent firms have refused to join the scheme, which is the only avenue of redress available to the public without going to court. </p> <p>In response to the article, consumer affairs minister Kim Howells issued a warning to agents who refuse to join. \"I am very concerned by the reports that the majority of estate agents have still to join the ombudsman scheme, especially as my department has been very active in encouraging estate agents to join the scheme,\" he said. </p> <p>\"By joining, businesses are proving their commitment to putting the needs of their customers at the heart of their business success. I want to remind all estate agents to join the scheme as soon as possible. As I have said previously, statutory legislation remains a serious option if they fail to sign up,\" he added. </p> <p>Ms Jansen would welcome statutory regulation of estate agents, as her experience has left her feeling cheated. In June last year, Ms Jansen signed what she thought was a straightforward sole agency contract for 16 weeks with a two week notice period. \"As I understood it the contract was for 16 weeks, during which time if another agent sold the house, I would have to pay multiple agency fees,\" she said. </p> <p>But as ever, the small print contained an extra condition. The 16 week period which started from the date the contract was signed, would be \"suspended as soon as the sale is agreed and restarts in the event of the sale falling through\". </p> <p>The property was put on the market in June and a sale was agreed in August, when the contract had only been in operation for seven weeks and six days. By January, the sale had fallen through. Ms Jansen, who was unhappy with the service she had received from the agency, decided to terminate the contract after giving notice. </p> <p>However, the agency pointed to the fact that the contract had been suspended after the offer had been made and was reactivated when the sale fell through. In practice this meant the contract had another eight weeks and one day to run before it expired at the end of March. </p> <p>She was informed that should another agent sell the property before the sole agency period had expired, she would have to stump up the cash for their fee. </p> <p>Her solicitor agreed that, although the contract was un fair, the agents would be within their rights to take proceedings against her. Trading standards officers also confirmed that the length of the agreement was classed as a core term of the contract and therefore could not be challenged under the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts regulations that came into force in October 1999. </p> <p>Brian Mathews, of Arun Estates, Cubitt &amp; West's parent company, denied the contract was unfair: \"Our agreements have trading standards' approval. It's important to us not to breach any trading standards regulations.\" </p> <p>The consumer contract regulations, introduced to combat rip-off Britain, say that a consumer is not bound by a standard term in a contract with a seller or supplier if that term is unfair. Unfairness is defined as creating a significant imbalance in the parties' rights and obligations under the contract, to the detriment of the consumer and in favour of the business. </p> <p>Ms Jansen didn't feel able to risk being forced to pay fees to two sets of agents, so she gave notice and waited for the contract to run out before placing the property with another agent. </p> <p>Hugh Dunsmore-Hardy, chief executive of the National Association of Estate Agents, said agents' contracts vary widely and homeowners should ensure they understand every aspect of what they're being asked to sign. </p> <p>A sole agency contract is one where the agent expects to be the only one with the right to sell your property. This means you may have to pay the agent even if another agent finds you a buyer. </p> <p>Sole selling rights is the same as sole agency except you have to pay the estate agent even if you find your own purchaser, such as a friend. Multiple agency agree ments allow you to market the property with several agents and, as a result of the extra competition for buyers, agents charge higher fees. </p> <p>Straightforward enough on the surface, but contracts are frequently a source of contention. Last year, high profile agents FPD Savills came under fire from the Consumers' Association following the case of a couple who faced estate agency charges of almost \u00a39,500 by FPD Savills, even though their flat remained unsold after negotiations fell through. </p> <p> Their contract meant that even vendors who were forced to withdraw due to circumstances beyond their control, were liable to pay fees. </p> <p>The Consumers' Association used its powers to enforce Unfair Contract Terms Regulations, and wrote asking FPD Savills to rewrite its contract. FPD Savills responded by amending its contracts to make them clearer and fairer to the consumer. </p> <p>Ms Jansen warns vendors to look closely at their contracts and seek the advice of a solicitor if in doubt. Moving house is rarely a smooth process; delays and hiccups are frequent. Some sellers see out several abortive sales before exchanging contracts and, in theory, the kind of contract Ms Jansen signed could go on being suspended and reactivated for a long time. </p> <p>Her property is now being marketed with another estate agent who offered her a straightforward sole agency period of 12 weeks with a 14 day notice period. And a sale is on the point of being secured. </p> <p>Ms Jansen wants to see estate agents subjected to statutory regulation and the introduction of standard contracts to protect sellers like herself. \"It was a nightmare not being able to remarket the property with a more suitable estate agent,\" she says. </p> <p>Until the government moves to change the law, it is up to sellers to make their own checks on estate agents.

True, they can be a bit rude to look at, and, if not cooked very carefully, can feel as if you've put a peculiarly dense rubbery toy in your mouth. When treated with care, however, they have an unmatched sweetness and a forceful tenderness. And when that sweetness is matched against garlic soya sauce, well, then you know what a perfect marriage is all about. </p> <p>Pimlott and I were lunching at Mandarin Kitchen when we came across these razor clams with garlic soya sauce. We rejoiced. Mandarin Kitchen won the Asian section of the Mo\u00ebt et Chandon London Restaurant Awards last week, for which I was a judge. So why bother with a review, you may ask - surely, if you helped vote it a winner, you must have eaten there before and never thought to mention it to us. All true. I have eaten there several times, and thought highly of it, but I thought it a good idea to remind myself just why. </p> <p>Mandarin Kitchen certainly did not get the award for its decor, which is far removed from the high-concept, designer dream world that is now part of the eating experience. It would be kind to call the place utilitarian in its approach to visual display, though more accurate to say that it resembles a generously proportioned, white-painted tube tunnel with windows. But looks aren't everything. Indeed, they may not be anything. Mandarin Kitchen rates as one of the more difficult restaurants in west London in which to find a seat come dinner time, partly because discerning and curious London chefs love to eat there. </p> <p>Why? In a word, fish. It isn't just the best Chinese fish restaurant in town. It's possibly the best fish restaurant of any national denomination. It is said to sell more lobster than any other place in London, but we weren't there for that. We wanted the marine exotica that you rarely see on other menus: the aforementioned clams, roast baby squid with chilli and garlic, sea cucumber pot, monkfish in ginger sauce and, by way of contrast, spicy beef shin from a section on the menu delightfully named \"cold toss\". In fact, the thought of the sea cucumber really set Pimlott slavering, but we'll come to that. </p> <p>I've already extolled the virtues of the clams, and similar accuracy in cooking technique meant that another potentially dentally challenging shellfish, squid, was as resistant to the tooth as a rose petal. A toothless old crone could have eaten these squid and, equally remarkable, tasted them. Let's face it, squid isn't one of Dame Nature's heavy hitters. Texture, great; taste, the weak link - unless it's been squidding about until a few hours before hitting the pan. These, like all the fish at Mandarin Kitchen, obviously had been, so held their own with the garlic and chilli. </p> <p>I set about demolishing the honorary meat dish virtually singlehanded - Pimlott, wisely as it turned out, was reserving his fire for the sea cucumber pot - and, given the generous nature of the portion, eating the lot was quite an undertaking. Nevertheless, I managed it. Shin of beef is another ingredient that we see far too little of on contemporary menus. The European way is to braise it for hours and hours until the meat turns gently and silkily fibrous. The Chinese way is to braise it with spices - notably, in this case, star anise - for not nearly so long, let it cool, slice it thinly and then relish the interplay between the dense meat, and the cores of gelatine and connective tissue running through it. </p> <p>The monkfish was anonymous after these kitchen curiosities, partly because the ginger was not its usual cheerful, challenging self. It was unusually self-effacing, and the dish suffered as a result. But one dish's disappointment is another's opportunity, and in came the sea cucumber pot. You may not be familiar with sea cucumber. You are not alone in this. They figure prominently in photographs of coral reefs in National Geographic, but rather less frequently on fishmongers' slabs. They aren't vegetables at all, but curious creatures, kind of marine cleaners, hoovering up all the stuff that other denizens of the deep won't touch. What came out of the braising pot and into our bowls were short sections of what appeared to be draught excluder of almost supernatural slipperiness, and was a severe test of chopstick technique. As for flavour, I would say that sea cucumber rates slightly lower than phlegm, the texture of which it closely resembles. But then, that's the point. The braising medium, stock and shitake mushrooms contributed the flavour, the sea cucumber variations on jelly, which is so appreciated by the Chinese and so unrecognised by most of the rest of us. </p> <p>I withdrew from the contest after a couple of exploratory mouthfuls, but Pimlott ploughed his way through the lot, cooing cheerfully as he went. It was a majestic performance, helped by a bottle of Pinot Grigio from a rather well-appointed wine list. It worked exceptionally well, and made but a modest contribution to our bill of \u00a370.40. And \u00a370.40 seems remarkably little to pay for superlative fish and shellfish that is handled with supreme assurance, not to mention the rare opportunity to come to grips with a sea cucumber.

      "body": "<p>On the face of it, the most reviled government department in Britain had at last got something right. A week ago the Ministry of Agriculture and the army identified a disused Cumbrian airfield as the perfect site for a purpose-built incinerator to burn the backlog of animals killed during the foot and mouth epidemic. </p> <p>Work started last Saturday; by Sunday an access road was in place; by Monday a 500 metre pyre was built, ready to burn 3,000 diseased carcasses every day - for a year if necessary. Wagons carrying slaughtered cattle from all over northern Britain began converging on the aerodrome; on Thursday night someone counted 83 lorries. This was to be Britain's biggest animal crematorium. </p> <p>Its rapid construction was, at last, the display of fast-moving efficiency for which the nation had been waiting. It was probably a re-enactment of the kind of wartime effort that built the airfield in the first place. </p> <p>Unfortunately, though, this was under the control of Maff, an organisation so hapless that if it began selling umbrellas, the rain would cease. Yesterday it was obliged to close the site for at least a week. It may never reopen. And unless there is a dramatic change of mood, it may have to do so over the prone bodies of local residents. With amazing crassness officials had chosen Hallburn aerodrome - less than a mile from the centre of Longtown, the small town outside Carlisle which has attained a sort of infamy as the foot and mouth capital of the world. </p> <p>Longtown has been surrounded - and sometimes covered - by choking smoke for the past five weeks. On the six-mile drive between here and Carlisle there is not an animal left alive in the fields. Throughout that time the first view of the town for anyone driving north from Carlisle has been the pyre of burning sheep at Howend Farm. It is still alight; local gossip is that officials chose such cheap coal that the carcasses have never burned properly. </p> <p>Hallburn was supposed to solve these problems, and do the job properly. Special low-sulphur coal was being imported from Colombia to replace the stuff from Workington. Steel girders were used to hold the carcasses off the ground and ensure a proper up-draught. It was, said Ian Pearson, the regional disposals manager for Maff, \"a new-technology burn: a faster, efficient, higher-temperature burn\". </p> <p>But it would still burn over Longtown, and Longtown fought back - the mouse that roared. At an astonishing public meeting this week about half the population turned up at the town's community centre and routed a group of ill-briefed officials - from Maff, local councils, the army and the environment agency - who had been sent to reassure them that there was no danger to their health. </p> <p><strong>Fury</strong><br> </p> <p>The officials appeared to imagine this was a routine meeting of hayseeds; the army sent just a fresh-faced lieutenant. Nothing in the panel's lives of decent obscurity could have prepared them for the fury that would follow. It was, in that sense, a microcosm of the way this epidemic has overwhelmed thousands of other well-meaning public servants, up to and including the minister of agriculture himself. </p> <p>They were in trouble from the moment North Cumbria's director of public health, Peter Tiplady, was over-smugly announcing that the chances of BSE spreading from the pyres was \"one in a million\". A voice cried out: \"You don't give a shit. You're just happy to come to Longtown and set fire to it.\" This was wildly applauded. </p> <p>The best-researched, and most decisive intervention came from James Bell, son of a retired Longtown vet, who announced himself as \"research and technical director for a company which is a recognised world leader in carbon chain degradation\" and said he had 13 questions. As soon as he mentioned \"polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons\" the panel had a problem. </p> <p>At one point the chairman tried to wrestle the microphone from him, which was a mistake. But long before question 11 (\"Are you aware of the EU R45 requirements instanced in 75/552/EEC and 67/548/EEC?\") they had all slumped defeated into their seats. </p> <p>The only question they probably even grasped was the last: \"Is there anything that can be said that will stop the burn at Hallburn?\" </p> <p>Surprisingly, there was. Other speakers gave less technical but equally forceful testimony. \"My garden and my window are smothered with globules from the burning,\" said a lady from Chapelknowe. \"It's like a resin. Even a woman knows that what goes up must come down.\" </p> <p>Longtown was unanimous. And Nick Utting, the area NFU secretary, eventually took the microphone. He told Ian Pearson: \"I'm afraid, sir, that you cannot expect Longtown to take any more. The people have had enough.\" Pearson meekly agreed and said he would recommend that the site, in which more than \u00a32m is thought to have been invested, close at once. </p> <p>Bell calculated that the smoke would contain eight carcinogens, dioxin, mustard gas and - even with the low-sulphur coal - 9,000 tons of sulphur dioxide. No one has yet emerged to counter his claims or to answer the obvious question about whether the smoke contains foot and mouth germs. The wind would carry the flames either over the town or towards the Lyne Valley, the one part of the Longtown area which has remained relatively disease-free, with 11 farms still uncontaminated. </p> <p><strong> Blood</strong><br> </p> <p>The Lyne Valley was also the route chosen for the wagons to carry the diseased bodies to the site. \"They're supposed to be sealed,\" said farmer John Armstrong, \"but I know that at least one of them has had blood dripping.\" His neighbour, Sam Alexander, a pig-farmer forced into retirement several agricultural crises ago, said: \"The drivers have got no consideration whatever. They're going so fast along these narrow roads they're going to kill someone.\" </p> <p>All these issues are now being discussed at meetings between Maff officials and Arthuret parish council, which covers Longtown. Other councillors and vociferous opponents were being excluded from the talks. But Karen Johnson, the council clerk, was still insisting yesterday: \"We don't intend to compromise. As far as we're concerned, Hallburn will stay closed.\" </p> <p>There is still talk of protesters lying down in front of the lorries, on the off-chance that the drivers would notice. </p> <p>The issue has at least given Longtown a new focus, a rallying-point after six weeks that have brought nothing but despair and dissension. </p> <p>\"It's been setting farmer against farmer, neighbour against neighbour,\" a resident said. The sheep mart, once Longtown's biggest business, remains firmly padlocked, although the yard has been taken over by the diggers used to construct the pyres. Trade remains appalling: even the barber is said to have lost half his trade now the farmers no longer come to town. </p> <p>The church, at least, has been doing better business and John Smith, the priest, continues to preach hope. The congregation will be singing Oh God, Our Help in Ages Past tomorrow, as they have done ever since the crisis started. But the help has been a long time coming. Except for the fortress of the Lyne Valley, there is hardly a sheep or cow left alive round Longtown. Normally, by now, the fields would be alive with gambolling and baa-ing lambs. There is nothing: it is Silent Spring. </p> <p>Margaret Armstrong, a haulier's wife (no relation to John), was musing over coffee about these strange times: \"I phoned a friend and said 'Jean, what did we do before foot and mouth?' I can't remember what we talked about. People used to say what a lovely life we had up here. I can't ever see it being normal again now. </p> <p>\"It seems just like snakes and ladders. Sometimes you seem to be up a bit and things are getting a bit better. Then suddenly you hit another snake and you're down again. But, no matter what, you never get back where you were.\"</p> <p><strong>Email update</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/email\">Sign up for our free daily foot and mouth round-up</a></p> <p><strong>More on the election and foot and mouth</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/footandmouth\">Politics: foot and mouth</a></p> <p><strong>What's going on?</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/list\">Full list: outbreaks </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,464555,00.html\">Graph: rise in cases</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,460510,00.html\">Full list: closed &amp; cancelled</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\">Causes and effects</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/theissues/article/0,6512,441031,00.html\">The issue explained</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,471911,00.html\">11.04.2001: Foot and mouth in Europe</a></p> <p><strong>The front line: meet those affected by the crisis</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,467836,00.html\">03.04.2001: Straws in the wind</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html\">06.03.2001: Meet our panel</a><br> </p> <p><strong>Related articles</strong><br><a href=\"\u0094http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,472375,00.html\u0094\">12.04.2001: Maff halts release of foot and mouth figures</a><br><a href=\"\u0094http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,472342,00.html\u0094\">12.04.2001: Take Easter break in countryside, urges PM</a><br><a href=\"\u0094http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,472066,00.html\u0094\">12.04.2001: Epidemic 'past its peak' but some areas defy trend</a><br><a href=\"\u0094http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,472057,00.html\u0094\">12.04.2001: \u0091We aren't moving.

      "bodyText": "On the face of it, the most reviled government department in Britain had at last got something right. A week ago the Ministry of Agriculture and the army identified a disused Cumbrian airfield as the perfect site for a purpose-built incinerator to burn the backlog of animals killed during the foot and mouth epidemic. Work started last Saturday; by Sunday an access road was in place; by Monday a 500 metre pyre was built, ready to burn 3,000 diseased carcasses every day - for a year if necessary. Wagons carrying slaughtered cattle from all over northern Britain began converging on the aerodrome; on Thursday night someone counted 83 lorries. This was to be Britain's biggest animal crematorium. Its rapid construction was, at last, the display of fast-moving efficiency for which the nation had been waiting. It was probably a re-enactment of the kind of wartime effort that built the airfield in the first place. Unfortunately, though, this was under the control of Maff, an organisation so hapless that if it began selling umbrellas, the rain would cease. Yesterday it was obliged to close the site for at least a week. It may never reopen. And unless there is a dramatic change of mood, it may have to do so over the prone bodies of local residents. With amazing crassness officials had chosen Hallburn aerodrome - less than a mile from the centre of Longtown, the small town outside Carlisle which has attained a sort of infamy as the foot and mouth capital of the world. Longtown has been surrounded - and sometimes covered - by choking smoke for the past five weeks. On the six-mile drive between here and Carlisle there is not an animal left alive in the fields. Throughout that time the first view of the town for anyone driving north from Carlisle has been the pyre of burning sheep at Howend Farm. It is still alight; local gossip is that officials chose such cheap coal that the carcasses have never burned properly. Hallburn was supposed to solve these problems, and do the job properly. Special low-sulphur coal was being imported from Colombia to replace the stuff from Workington. Steel girders were used to hold the carcasses off the ground and ensure a proper up-draught. It was, said Ian Pearson, the regional disposals manager for Maff, \"a new-technology burn: a faster, efficient, higher-temperature burn\". But it would still burn over Longtown, and Longtown fought back - the mouse that roared. At an astonishing public meeting this week about half the population turned up at the town's community centre and routed a group of ill-briefed officials - from Maff, local councils, the army and the environment agency - who had been sent to reassure them that there was no danger to their health. Fury The officials appeared to imagine this was a routine meeting of hayseeds; the army sent just a fresh-faced lieutenant. Nothing in the panel's lives of decent obscurity could have prepared them for the fury that would follow. It was, in that sense, a microcosm of the way this epidemic has overwhelmed thousands of other well-meaning public servants, up to and including the minister of agriculture himself. They were in trouble from the moment North Cumbria's director of public health, Peter Tiplady, was over-smugly announcing that the chances of BSE spreading from the pyres was \"one in a million\". A voice cried out: \"You don't give a shit. You're just happy to come to Longtown and set fire to it.\" This was wildly applauded. The best-researched, and most decisive intervention came from James Bell, son of a retired Longtown vet, who announced himself as \"research and technical director for a company which is a recognised world leader in carbon chain degradation\" and said he had 13 questions. As soon as he mentioned \"polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons\" the panel had a problem. At one point the chairman tried to wrestle the microphone from him, which was a mistake. But long before question 11 (\"Are you aware of the EU R45 requirements instanced in 75/552/EEC and 67/548/EEC?\") they had all slumped defeated into their seats. The only question they probably even grasped was the last: \"Is there anything that can be said that will stop the burn at Hallburn?\" Surprisingly, there was. Other speakers gave less technical but equally forceful testimony. \"My garden and my window are smothered with globules from the burning,\" said a lady from Chapelknowe. \"It's like a resin. Even a woman knows that what goes up must come down.\" Longtown was unanimous. And Nick Utting, the area NFU secretary, eventually took the microphone. He told Ian Pearson: \"I'm afraid, sir, that you cannot expect Longtown to take any more. The people have had enough.\" Pearson meekly agreed and said he would recommend that the site, in which more than \u00a32m is thought to have been invested, close at once. Bell calculated that the smoke would contain eight carcinogens, dioxin, mustard gas and - even with the low-sulphur coal - 9,000 tons of sulphur dioxide. No one has yet emerged to counter his claims or to answer the obvious question about whether the smoke contains foot and mouth germs. The wind would carry the flames either over the town or towards the Lyne Valley, the one part of the Longtown area which has remained relatively disease-free, with 11 farms still uncontaminated. Blood The Lyne Valley was also the route chosen for the wagons to carry the diseased bodies to the site. \"They're supposed to be sealed,\" said farmer John Armstrong, \"but I know that at least one of them has had blood dripping.\" His neighbour, Sam Alexander, a pig-farmer forced into retirement several agricultural crises ago, said: \"The drivers have got no consideration whatever.

The issue has at least given Longtown a new focus, a rallying-point after six weeks that have brought nothing but despair and dissension. \"It's been setting farmer against farmer, neighbour against neighbour,\" a resident said. The sheep mart, once Longtown's biggest business, remains firmly padlocked, although the yard has been taken over by the diggers used to construct the pyres. Trade remains appalling: even the barber is said to have lost half his trade now the farmers no longer come to town.

      "body": "<p>Chris Green, the despairing and widely criticised man at the centre of the Virgin Trains fares row, bemoans the fact that the rail industry lacks a single, powerful leader. Split into more than 100 parts, he believes it needs cohesion, but there is nobody with the skill and the authority to develop it. </p> <p> It cannot be Green. He is probably the best-known railwayman in Britain, having served a long apprenticeship with British Rail before taking over \"this most exciting job\" as chief executive of Virgin Trains, which has a record of being one of Britain's most unreliable companies. </p> <p> He does not want to lead the industry, but he knows somebody who should, or to put it more accurately, he knows the job description. The job title is chairman of the Strategic Rail Authority, at present occupied by Sir Alastair Morton, but while Mr Green acknowledges Sir Alastair's contribution, he finds that he has been \"a reluctant bride\". </p> <p> The leader Green is looking for must stand between the customer and Railtrack - the person who must decide \"whether we want low fares and high subsidies or the other way around\". The successful candidate would act like an \"admiral of a flotilla of ships, directing their passage to make sure that they come safely through to the harbour\". </p> <p> By saying this, Green is joining the growing debate within the industry and government that Sir Alastair has not been fulfilling his role and may have to move on if he fails to satisfy their expectations. </p> <p> Green said: \"If Sir Alastair does not accept the role of leadership and strategy, our industry will not be able to progress satisfactorily.\" In making these comments this week, Green was sticking his neck out. He is at present looking to the SRA for succour over his plan to increase Virgin's fares by up to 10% from May 21, a decision which cannot be revoked. Green would like to impose a fares freeze if he could get a deal with the SRA, the government's official industry arm. If not, he does not rule out further fare rises later this year. </p> <p> Understandably, passengers have been reluctant to accept Virgin's hard luck story. But, according to Green, it must be put down to the appalling impact of the Hatfield rail disaster on the industry. Six months on, the issue is who is going to pay for the unpredictable effects of Hatfield. Like foot and mouth, the financial implications of the crisis are far beyond the means of any single owner. </p> <p> In BR days, the government would have carried the insurance risk of last resort and would no doubt have slowed down some investment to balance the books. Virgin is one of the worst hit of the train operators, although Great North Eastern Railway has almost certainly been decimated by Hatfield, followed last month by the Selby rail crash, but is not saying so as graphically as Virgin. Green said that, although traffic was now only 10% below what it was before Hatfield, Virgin lost \u00a3100m in income in just 12 months and would lose a further \u00a350m this year unless it put up its fares. </p> <p> He maintained he had received only \u00a330m in compensation from Railtrack - which has accepted direct responsibility for Hatfield - and like other rail companies, is planning to claim more through the courts. </p> <p> Green continued: \"Virgin is the first to agree that big fare increases are unfair to rail users, but it has run out of options, short of slowing down investment or handing back the keys. </p> <p> \"We have had to watch government give Railtrack \u00a31.5bn of extra subsidy to tide it through a crisis of its own making, while we face months of judicial action to extract our rightful compensation.\" Better late and safe </p> <p> You might think Green has almost reached the end of his tether in trying to run a high profile rail company owned by Britain's most controversial entrepreneur, Sir Richard Branson. </p> <p> Having put his name to some old rolling stock on a clapped-out railway, Sir Richard was obviously prepared to take the brickbats, but these have been slung at him for almost four years, and passengers have noticed little improvement. Indeed in the months since Hatfield, things have got noticeably worse. Green makes no bones about the reasons - he said recently: \"If safer trains mean later trains, then so be it.\" </p> <p> But Green, a professional railwayman since 1965, when BR made him a junior manager and he lived above the shop - in a small flat while Birmingham New Street station was being noisily renovated - has always been an optimist. \"The positive side to all this is that \u00a37.5bn has been invested in the upgrade of the west coast main line and new rolling stock, and I will soon be taking delivery of 840 coaches, the last by 2003, for the west coast main line and for our cross-country services between Inverness and Cornwall. This is far bigger than anything under nationalisation, and shows the commitment of the private sector to this potentially exciting industry.\" </p> <p> Green was born in the leafy suburb of Richmond in Surrey, developing a love of the railway - \"not as an anorak\" - as he made his way to school every day on the District line. He subsequently found himself at Oxford at the time Dr Beeching was writing his two reports. The first and best remembered brought about huge cuts on rural services. The second was a plan to upgrade long distance lines and increase speeds. Beeching also proposed the concept of inter-City services - which 30 years later Green turned into a profit of almost \u00a3100m. </p> <p> Green climbed quickly up BR's oily, stained greasy pole, stopping off to perform increasingly important jobs in Nottingham, Hull and Edinburgh. He brought together BR's shambolic southern commuter network before heading off to Scotland to run ScotRail in the dying days of the state-run industry. He was never an advocate of John Major's type of privatisation, but kept his mouth shut. \"My view is that the industry should have been been kept intact and privatised as one unit. Tearing it apart was doomed to failure, and we have been picking up the pieces ever since.\" </p> <p> After a brief unhappy period as chief executive of English Heritage, where he skirmished with its chairman, Sir Jocelyn Stevens, over his personal expenses, Green started out again as a railway consultant before being snapped up by Sir Richard. \"His philosophy is simple. In this increasingly congested island, there must be a place for a dynamic rail system.\" </p> <p> In his quieter moments, Green takes to the canals or goes hill walking in the Lakes. \"On the canals, you just go at three miles an hour and there are no roads and certainly no trains.

      "bodyText": "Chris Green, the despairing and widely criticised man at the centre of the Virgin Trains fares row, bemoans the fact that the rail industry lacks a single, powerful leader. Split into more than 100 parts, he believes it needs cohesion, but there is nobody with the skill and the authority to develop it. It cannot be Green. He is probably the best-known railwayman in Britain, having served a long apprenticeship with British Rail before taking over \"this most exciting job\" as chief executive of Virgin Trains, which has a record of being one of Britain's most unreliable companies. He does not want to lead the industry, but he knows somebody who should, or to put it more accurately, he knows the job description. The job title is chairman of the Strategic Rail Authority, at present occupied by Sir Alastair Morton, but while Mr Green acknowledges Sir Alastair's contribution, he finds that he has been \"a reluctant bride\". The leader Green is looking for must stand between the customer and Railtrack - the person who must decide \"whether we want low fares and high subsidies or the other way around\". The successful candidate would act like an \"admiral of a flotilla of ships, directing their passage to make sure that they come safely through to the harbour\". By saying this, Green is joining the growing debate within the industry and government that Sir Alastair has not been fulfilling his role and may have to move on if he fails to satisfy their expectations. Green said: \"If Sir Alastair does not accept the role of leadership and strategy, our industry will not be able to progress satisfactorily.\" In making these comments this week, Green was sticking his neck out. He is at present looking to the SRA for succour over his plan to increase Virgin's fares by up to 10% from May 21, a decision which cannot be revoked. Green would like to impose a fares freeze if he could get a deal with the SRA, the government's official industry arm. If not, he does not rule out further fare rises later this year. Understandably, passengers have been reluctant to accept Virgin's hard luck story. But, according to Green, it must be put down to the appalling impact of the Hatfield rail disaster on the industry. Six months on, the issue is who is going to pay for the unpredictable effects of Hatfield. Like foot and mouth, the financial implications of the crisis are far beyond the means of any single owner. In BR days, the government would have carried the insurance risk of last resort and would no doubt have slowed down some investment to balance the books. Virgin is one of the worst hit of the train operators, although Great North Eastern Railway has almost certainly been decimated by Hatfield, followed last month by the Selby rail crash, but is not saying so as graphically as Virgin. Green said that, although traffic was now only 10% below what it was before Hatfield, Virgin lost \u00a3100m in income in just 12 months and would lose a further \u00a350m this year unless it put up its fares. He maintained he had received only \u00a330m in compensation from Railtrack - which has accepted direct responsibility for Hatfield - and like other rail companies, is planning to claim more through the courts. Green continued: \"Virgin is the first to agree that big fare increases are unfair to rail users, but it has run out of options, short of slowing down investment or handing back the keys. \"We have had to watch government give Railtrack \u00a31.5bn of extra subsidy to tide it through a crisis of its own making, while we face months of judicial action to extract our rightful compensation.\" Better late and safe You might think Green has almost reached the end of his tether in trying to run a high profile rail company owned by Britain's most controversial entrepreneur, Sir Richard Branson. Having put his name to some old rolling stock on a clapped-out railway, Sir Richard was obviously prepared to take the brickbats, but these have been slung at him for almost four years, and passengers have noticed little improvement. Indeed in the months since Hatfield, things have got noticeably worse. Green makes no bones about the reasons - he said recently: \"If safer trains mean later trains, then so be it.\" But Green, a professional railwayman since 1965, when BR made him a junior manager and he lived above the shop - in a small flat while Birmingham New Street station was being noisily renovated - has always been an optimist. \"The positive side to all this is that \u00a37.5bn has been invested in the upgrade of the west coast main line and new rolling stock, and I will soon be taking delivery of 840 coaches, the last by 2003, for the west coast main line and for our cross-country services between Inverness and Cornwall. This is far bigger than anything under nationalisation, and shows the commitment of the private sector to this potentially exciting industry.\" Green was born in the leafy suburb of Richmond in Surrey, developing a love of the railway - \"not as an anorak\" - as he made his way to school every day on the District line. He subsequently found himself at Oxford at the time Dr Beeching was writing his two reports. The first and best remembered brought about huge cuts on rural services. The second was a plan to upgrade long distance lines and increase speeds. Beeching also proposed the concept of inter-City services - which 30 years later Green turned into a profit of almost \u00a3100m. Green climbed quickly up BR's oily, stained greasy pole, stopping off to perform increasingly important jobs in Nottingham, Hull and Edinburgh. He brought together BR's shambolic southern commuter network before heading off to Scotland to run ScotRail in the dying days of the state-run industry. He was never an advocate of John Major's type of privatisation, but kept his mouth shut. \"My view is that the industry should have been been kept intact and privatised as one unit. Tearing it apart was doomed to failure, and we have been picking up the pieces ever since.\" After a brief unhappy period as chief executive of English Heritage, where he skirmished with its chairman, Sir Jocelyn Stevens, over his personal expenses, Green started out again as a railway consultant before being snapped up by Sir Richard. \"His philosophy is simple. In this increasingly congested island, there must be a place for a dynamic rail system.\" In his quieter moments, Green takes to the canals or goes hill walking in the Lakes. \"On the canals, you just go at three miles an hour and there are no roads and certainly no trains. Only pleasant waterside pubs. It gives you a remarkably new perspective of what a beautiful country we live in.\" Green is a stern opponent of throwing up the bricks and starting again. His \"single leader\" would work towards delivering a \"joined up railway\" helped by the 25 train companies. Petty commercial differences have kept them apart in the first few years of privatisation, preventing them from making sensible progress. Now, said Green, they should act together and produce a joint marketing strategy and fares structure. The wide discrepancies on unregulated fares make this an urgent issue.

The secondary culling - crucial to create firebreaks - was happening only about 70% of the time.</p> <p>Mr Brown told BBC Radio 4's The World at One: \"One problem we have is that, although we are often able to make a start on it within the 48 hours, it is often very difficult to see it through to a conclusion because of the sheer volume of work.\"</p> <p>Epidemiologists have based their most optimistic estimates of controlling the spread of the disease on all infected animals being killed within 24 hours and those on adjoining premises within 48 hours. Scientists from Imperial College, London, yesterday said nearly a third of British farms could be infected unless the firebreak culling of healthy cattle near infected sites was intensified.</p> <p>\"The 48 hour timescale is extremely difficult to achieve,\" a Maff official said yesterday. \"There are a lot of difficulties meeting the targets. It would be astonishing if Devon, for instance, where there have been hundreds of contiguous cases in the past few days, was coming close to meeting the targets.\"</p> <p>The battle against foot and mouth disease has become Britain's biggest combined civil and military exercise in more than 30 years, Brigadier Malcolm Wood, second in command of the operation to kill and bury millions of animals, said yesterday. \"Nothing I have been involved with, including the Gulf war and Bosnia, compares to this. The scale is enormous,\" he added.</p> <p>Almost 2,000 military personnel are involved in the fight against the disease, working alongside 1,700 vets.</p> <p>Maff officials said the average daily number of confirmed foot and mouth cases fell by a quarter last week. In the seven-day period ending April 8, there was an average of 32 new cases each day compared with 43 in the previous week.</p> <p>The government is finding it increasingly difficult to find new sites for disposal of animals. \"We're not on top of the disposal,\" Maff admitted last night. Preparation work on a giant burial pit for animal carcasses is continuing in Devon over the weekend. The site at Ash Moor, near Petrockstowe, will be capable of taking more than 430,000 sheep carcasses.</p> <p>Meanwhile the RSPCA was yesterday investigating a marksman's attempts to kill sheep as part of the cull in south Wales. Amateur video footage showed the local authority marksman taking potshots at the animals in a field and failing to kill at least one after several attempts.</p> <p>The RSPCA said the video had \"shocked and appalled\" its officers and it might prosecute. \"Yes, there is a crisis in the countryside, but it is not a licence for cruelty. No vet was present at this culling to ensure the animals did not suffer.\"</p> <p>Mr Brown yesterday gave the strongest signal yet that he favours a limited vaccination programme, and has serious doubts about the scale of the culling and the continuing outbreaks. \"The strategy I am attracted to is one which uses vaccination in order to ensure that the high value animals, the cattle, live on rather than are culled out, but vaccination is not a way of defeating the disease once it has occurred,\" he told Radio 4.</p> <p>Potentially more damaging news came when a suspected case of swine fever was identified at a pig fattening unit, the Ministry of Agriculture said last night. The site in Ardleigh, near Colchester, Essex, has been sealed off and officials haveimposed movement restrictions, a spokeswoman said.</p> <p>If tests on samples prove positive for classical swine fever, all animals at the unit will be slaughtered. More than 36,000 pigs were slaughtered after an outbreak of the infectious disease last August, the first in Britain for 14 years.</p> <p><b>Email update</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/email\">Sign up for our free daily foot and mouth round-up</a><br><br><b>More on the election and foot and mouth</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/footandmouth\">Politics: foot and mouth</a></p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/list\">Full list: outbreaks </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,464555,00.html\">Graph: rise in cases</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,460510,00.html\">Full list: closed &amp; cancelled</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\">Causes and effects</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/theissues/article/0,6512,441031,00.html\">The issue explained</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,471911,00.html\">11.04.2001: Foot and mouth in Europe</a></p> <p><b>The front line: meet those affected by the crisis</b><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,467836,00.html\">03.04.2001: Straws in the wind</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html\">06.03.2001: Meet our panel</a><br> <br></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,472375,00.html\">12.04.2001: Maff halts release of foot and mouth figures</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,472342,00.html\">12.04.2001: Take Easter break in countryside, urges PM</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,472066,00.html\">12.04.2001: Epidemic 'past its peak' but some areas defy trend</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,472057,00.html\">12.04.2001: 'We aren't moving.

      "body": "<p>Scotland's tourism minister last night flew back from Italy into a storm of protest over his holiday plans. </p> <p>Alasdair Morrison's trip to the continent has been attacked as grossly insensitive by opposition politicians and tourism officials at a time when the tourist industry and farming community are in crisis. </p> <p>Mr Morrison, who had arranged the family break before the foot and mouth outbreak started, has expressed regret that his trip might have caused upset, but said he had done everything he could to help the tourist trade. He said he was returning home early to be with his father-in-law, who was seriously ill in hospital. </p> <p>\"If I have caused any offence to people working in tourism, then I certainly regret that,\" he said. </p> <p>Last month, Mr Morrison told the Scottish parliament that he planned to spend his summer holidays in Skye and in Dumfries and Galloway, the region worst hit by foot and mouth. </p> <p>He made no mention of the trip to Italy at Easter. </p> <p>In America last week, he joined first minister Henry McLeish in urging US holiday makers to come to Scotland. </p> <p>It has also emerged that a senior civil servant at the Scottish executive responsible for tourism and enterprise has been spending his Easter holidays at Euro Disney. </p> <p>The Scottish National Party said Mr Morrison had shown \"gross insensitivity\" in going ahead with his Italian holiday. </p> <p>Duncan Dewar, chief executive of the Fife-based tourist operations Days Away and Best of Scotland's Holidays, said Mr Morrison's decision was disgraceful. </p> <p>\"I think that it's extremely insensitive for a politician to do that.

      "bodyText": "Scotland's tourism minister last night flew back from Italy into a storm of protest over his holiday plans. Alasdair Morrison's trip to the continent has been attacked as grossly insensitive by opposition politicians and tourism officials at a time when the tourist industry and farming community are in crisis. Mr Morrison, who had arranged the family break before the foot and mouth outbreak started, has expressed regret that his trip might have caused upset, but said he had done everything he could to help the tourist trade. He said he was returning home early to be with his father-in-law, who was seriously ill in hospital. \"If I have caused any offence to people working in tourism, then I certainly regret that,\" he said. Last month, Mr Morrison told the Scottish parliament that he planned to spend his summer holidays in Skye and in Dumfries and Galloway, the region worst hit by foot and mouth. He made no mention of the trip to Italy at Easter. In America last week, he joined first minister Henry McLeish in urging US holiday makers to come to Scotland. It has also emerged that a senior civil servant at the Scottish executive responsible for tourism and enterprise has been spending his Easter holidays at Euro Disney. The Scottish National Party said Mr Morrison had shown \"gross insensitivity\" in going ahead with his Italian holiday. Duncan Dewar, chief executive of the Fife-based tourist operations Days Away and Best of Scotland's Holidays, said Mr Morrison's decision was disgraceful. \"I think that it's extremely insensitive for a politician to do that. He's made a real gaffe,\" he said. \"It is ill-thought at a time when businesses are struggling to survive. I think he should sit down and give himself a long time to think about what he has done.\" Scotland's tourist trade, which was in crisis even before the foot and mouth outbreak with a serious decline in overseas visitors, has been bracing itself for a further downturn since the start of the epidemic. The tourism body Visitscotland said it estimated the outbreak would cost the industry north of the border \u00a325m over the Easter fortnight and it projected there would be 80,000 fewer visitors than for the same period last year.

Last year's exposure of the mass Whitehall BSE cover-up, together with vast public opposition to GM foods and anxiety about the foot and mouth crisis, has led 72% of the public - and 57% of Labour voters - to disregard ministers' blandishments, the ICM research suggests. The findings, which appear in the Ecologist magazine, are likely to make uncomfortable reading for the prime minister, already aware of the cynicism surrounding \"spin\" and the levels of distrust surrounding farming methods, in the immediate run-up to the election campaign. The research, conducted three and a half weeks ago as the foot and mouth epidemic escalated dramatically, also reveals the public are sceptical of the prime minister's claims to be \"green\" - despite him promising five weeks ago to make Britain a leading player in \"the coming green industrial revolution\". Mr Blair announced \u00a3100m of new money to support wind and solar power and pledged to ratify the Kyoto protocol before the end of next year. Sixty-five per cent of the public believe Labour has done nothing to improve the environment since it came to power, mirroring the cries of opposition parties, which point to the fact Mr Blair made no speech on the environment for his first three and a half years in office. The figures also reflect the words of his own chief environmental adviser, Jonathan Porritt, who last September accused the prime minister of \"downgrading\" green issues, despite promising in Labour's manifesto to put them \"at the heart of government\". Two-thirds think there should be more emphasis on organic research - rather than GM foods, which gain 13 times as much government funding - and almost half (45%) believe there should be a ban on importing and testing GM crops in Britain. In a further embarrassment for the government, three-quarters of those surveyed believe Britain's beleaguered railway should be re-nationalised. Support is cross-party, with two-thirds of Tory voters calling for privatisation to be reversed, despite the Thatcher government having introduced it. But, with Railtrack due to bring havoc today with its most extensive Easter engineering programme \"for decades\", ministers are adamant re-nationalisation is not an option. \"The government has always said it would be too expensive and the money is better spent on priorities such as health and education,\" said a Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions spokeswoman last night.

Nor do foreign palaces tend to be made over to relatives of the royal family in the way that Kensington Palace has become what was once described as \"a subsidised chalet for redundant royals\". Other European royal families do not insist on the flummery and deference of Britain's royals. The king of Norway can be seen queueing to get into the cinema; no king of Sweden has gone through a coronation since the mid-19th century; the king of Spain has the use of eight palaces, but owns none of them. Through a mixture of good fortune and common sense, the monarchies of Europe are much more popular with their populations than Britain's is. They have pulled off the trick of appearing to be just regular folks, even if they are richer even than our royal family (Queen Beatrix is estimated to be worth more than \u00a33bn) or have privileges such as those enjoyed by the Danes, who are still exempt from taxation and have a taxpayer-subsidised yacht. European royal families do not have business guidelines, such as Britain's are drawing up. But their powers are controlled by written constitutions - Belgium's king is nominally selected by parliament and, although he signs all laws they also have to be countersigned by ministers. They even abdicate when they feel themselves getting too old these days, too - as Grand Duke Jean of Luxembourg did last year. Their children these days generally go to state schools and marry commoners, and most expect to work for a living. The expectations of their subjects are more relaxed and less frenetic than ours, too: when Crown Prince Haakon of Norway moved in with his ex-drug-taking, waitress girlfriend and her three-year-old son, no one turned a hair. Imagine what the News of the World would have made of that.",

      "body": "<p>The seeds of mass dissent were planted in vibrant road protests and squats, in opposition to GM foods and concern about quality of life in cities. They grew in giant carnival-style events in busy shopping streets and on motorways around the UK. They flourished around the world. They peaked in anti-globalisation demonstrations in Washington, Seattle and Prague, but the British anti-capitalist movement has been poisoned so deeply by hardliners intent on violence that it may never recover its popular appeal.</p> <p>Now, after bitter feuding between \"fluffies\" and \"spikies\" (pro-peaceful and pro-violent) over tactics and ideology, a winner seems to have emerged. \"The party's over,\" says one north London man who has been deeply involved in organising events, thought of himself as a moderate but will not take part in this year's May Day events in London.</p> <p><b> Hijacked by thugs</b><br></p> <p>According to many people involved in last May Day's digging up of Parliament Square by Reclaim the Streets to plant vegetables, and the later demonstrations in Trafalgar Square, the organisation of mass protest against third world debt, globalisation and the banking system has finally been hijacked by \"thugs\" who only want to attract peaceful protesters as a front for their destruction of property and confrontations with the police.</p> <p>Reclaim the Streets (RTS) is now divided, with many of its leading thinkers and most experienced organisers disaffected, and hundreds of people who might have come to London on May 1 have been deterred by the change in direction.</p> <p>Two additional factors suggest that this year's May Day event will not attract such large numbers as before. There is a widespread fear of oppressive policing: Scotland Yard announced on Thursday a high-risk \"zero tolerance\" approach to troublemakers. And untested legislation that could class protesters against ideological issues as terrorists will also drastically reduce the numbers involved.</p> <p>With police and potential protesters themselves deeply unclear as to what will happen on May Day, the best estimates so far are that fewer than 2,000 people will take to the streets for a series of actions billed widely as \"May Day Monopoly\". Police believe at least half of them intend to cause chaos. In previous years up to 15,000 people have come from all over the country.</p> <p>Through websites and a detailed pamphlet, people are being encouraged to take \"autonomous\" DIY actions against symbols of capitalism around London, with a showdown expected in Oxford Street in the afternoon of the Tuesday bank holiday. Without being an explicit call to arms, the subtext is clear. Every potential target is named - from McDonald's to the Royal Opera House.</p> <p><b> Alienation</b><br></p> <p>The shift has alienated hundreds of people who would have come to demonstrate peacefully. \"There's been a virtual war between the fluffies and the spikies,\" said one man who was arrested but not charged in last year's May Day disturbances. \"The spikies have won. I have sympathised completely with the protests so far. They have been fun and made good political points, but now they seem to want to get straight in.It has been taken over by the thugs\".</p> <p>Others agree, angry that mass protest organisers do not want to talk to the press or communicate their message more widely.</p> <p>\"The carnival is over. We're going back to old class war and fringe anarchist days. I went to a meeting a few weeks ago and the bottom line was just destroy property,\" said Chris Turnbull, a north Londoner who used to be involved with Reclaim the Streets.</p> <p>\"I am totally disillusioned. They've lost their focus, their sense of play and vision. The only ideology now seems to be destruction. The only images they want are ones of violence.\"</p> <p>Several people who worked with RTS have in effect been excommunicated from the loosely knit organisation that in the past seven years has been responsible for a number of huge street parties and demonstrations.</p> <p>\"There has been a witch hunt. People have been pilloried for standing up, just talking to the press or trying to explain to the public why people were demonstrating. The real organisation has become internecine, secret, exclusive and authoritarian,\" said one woman. \"They talk about equality and justice, but the reality is that there has been a pogrom.\"</p> <p>The deliberate lack of structure is deeply confusing to the police. \"Basically anyone who wants to organise something on May Day can call themselves what they want and do it,\" says Dave, who has been involved in radical street politics for seven years. \"In the past people have gone under the umbrella term of Reclaim the Streets, but this is changing, too. They're advertising it as a fun day out, but I wouldn't take my family as I did last year.\"</p> <p>RTS was never a formal organisation, one reason why the police, with their strict ranks and layers of bureaucracy, found it so hard to comprehend. But since the mayhem in Westminster last year, which led to the prime minister declaring that such behaviour must never happen again, undercover special branch officers have been desperately trying to gather more reliable intelligence, even asking disaffected RTS people to grass on their former friends. They have given no information.</p> <p>Some of what the police have discovered chimes with the views of the veteran demonstrators. \"We know we're not dealing with Reclaim the Streets any more,\" said one senior officer. \"We seem to have a new, tougher breed on our hands.</p> <p>\"Their aim is violence against property and police officers because that is the best way to get media attention. Some people who were encouraging violence within RTS have fanned out and started their own loosely knit organisations, but we don't know what support, if any, they have.\"</p> <p>Special branch has been taking a long, hard look at the Anarchist Federation, Solidarity Federation, the Birmingham Section 26 Collective and the Urban Alliance. Two weeks ago, the Met raided an empty factory in Brixton, south-west London, which was supposedly a secret training camp for another radical group, the Wombles - \"White Overall Movement Building Liberation Through Effective Struggle\".</p> <p><b> Wombles</b><br></p> <p>The Wombles style themselves on Ya Basta!, a highly disciplined and principled non-violent direct action Italian support group for the Zapatista rebels in Mexico. Wearing all white and using water pistols and mock weapons, Ya Basta! march with foam battering rams to pass through police lines.</p> <p>Prominent in Prague at the IMF/World Bank conference, they impressed many British activists who are thought to have have copied the idea. The British version of Ya Basta! has no formal connection with the Zapatistas.</p> <p>In one sense, the discovery was a coup for Scotland Yard. But although one white overall was found, and some graffiti (\"Smash Police Skull\"), there was little else to suggest it was a current training camp.</p> <p>The Wombles, whoever they are, had moved on. One protester, who claimed to be a Womble, was withering about the police raid. \"If we wanted violence, we wouldn't be marching on May Day with water pistols, inflatable hammers and a 50ft inflatable Uncle Bulgaria,\" the protester said.</p> <p>\"Even our name was a piss-take, but the fact that they are taking us so seriously is a joke on them. When they talk about sinister hardcore paramilitary Wombles, they look ridiculous.\"</p> <p>The police are not giving too much away at this stage. They have \"an intelligence picture\", built up by covert operations led by Special Branch and MI5, but do not know how accurate or clear it is.</p> <p>The Met's assistant commissioner Mike Todd, who is in overall charge of May Day policing this year, was candid enough to admit this week that none of the ringleaders of last year's trouble had been caught.</p> <p>There is concern that the protests that have been heavily flagged on the internet and in the May Day Monopoly game guide pamphlet will not be the focus of any trouble.</p> <p>\"Is there a hidden agenda?\", said an officer. \"We don't think so. But we cannot be sure.\"</p> <p>By sabre-rattling at this stage, the police are hoping to make trouble-makers think twice before coming at all.</p> <p>\"We have intelligence on certain individuals who we think are pulling the strings behind the scenes, but we do not have evidence,\" said one officer.</p> <p>\"We think we know who they are. Intelligence can help us prepare, but it won't get someone arrested. Intelligence can also be wrong. We won't really know what we're dealing with until the day.\" <br><br><b>On the road to violence</b><br><br></p> <p><b> May 14 1995</b> 500 anti-road protesters take over a half-mile stretch of Camden High Street in north London for a giant open-air party as part of a campaign to reclaim the streets for pedestrians and cyclists. Police arrest three people for public order offences</p> <p><b> July 23 1995</b> A lunchtime protest takes over Upper Street, Islington, one of north London's busiest roads. By early evening riot police move in to clear the road and sporadic fights break out as the 200 protesters are driven towards King's Cross station. Windows are smashed and bottles and cans are thrown at police as the protesters flee the area</p> <p><b> July 13 1996</b> Thousands of road protesters create traffic chaos in west London by holding a mass street party on the M41 at Shepherd's Bush.

They peaked in anti-globalisation demonstrations in Washington, Seattle and Prague, but the British anti-capitalist movement has been poisoned so deeply by hardliners intent on violence that it may never recover its popular appeal. Now, after bitter feuding between \"fluffies\" and \"spikies\" (pro-peaceful and pro-violent) over tactics and ideology, a winner seems to have emerged. \"The party's over,\" says one north London man who has been deeply involved in organising events, thought of himself as a moderate but will not take part in this year's May Day events in London. Hijacked by thugs According to many people involved in last May Day's digging up of Parliament Square by Reclaim the Streets to plant vegetables, and the later demonstrations in Trafalgar Square, the organisation of mass protest against third world debt, globalisation and the banking system has finally been hijacked by \"thugs\" who only want to attract peaceful protesters as a front for their destruction of property and confrontations with the police. Reclaim the Streets (RTS) is now divided, with many of its leading thinkers and most experienced organisers disaffected, and hundreds of people who might have come to London on May 1 have been deterred by the change in direction. Two additional factors suggest that this year's May Day event will not attract such large numbers as before. There is a widespread fear of oppressive policing: Scotland Yard announced on Thursday a high-risk \"zero tolerance\" approach to troublemakers. And untested legislation that could class protesters against ideological issues as terrorists will also drastically reduce the numbers involved. With police and potential protesters themselves deeply unclear as to what will happen on May Day, the best estimates so far are that fewer than 2,000 people will take to the streets for a series of actions billed widely as \"May Day Monopoly\". Police believe at least half of them intend to cause chaos. In previous years up to 15,000 people have come from all over the country. Through websites and a detailed pamphlet, people are being encouraged to take \"autonomous\" DIY actions against symbols of capitalism around London, with a showdown expected in Oxford Street in the afternoon of the Tuesday bank holiday. Without being an explicit call to arms, the subtext is clear. Every potential target is named - from McDonald's to the Royal Opera House. Alienation The shift has alienated hundreds of people who would have come to demonstrate peacefully. \"There's been a virtual war between the fluffies and the spikies,\" said one man who was arrested but not charged in last year's May Day disturbances. \"The spikies have won. I have sympathised completely with the protests so far. They have been fun and made good political points, but now they seem to want to get straight in.It has been taken over by the thugs\". Others agree, angry that mass protest organisers do not want to talk to the press or communicate their message more widely. \"The carnival is over. We're going back to old class war and fringe anarchist days. I went to a meeting a few weeks ago and the bottom line was just destroy property,\" said Chris Turnbull, a north Londoner who used to be involved with Reclaim the Streets. \"I am totally disillusioned. They've lost their focus, their sense of play and vision. The only ideology now seems to be destruction. The only images they want are ones of violence.\" Several people who worked with RTS have in effect been excommunicated from the loosely knit organisation that in the past seven years has been responsible for a number of huge street parties and demonstrations. \"There has been a witch hunt. People have been pilloried for standing up, just talking to the press or trying to explain to the public why people were demonstrating. The real organisation has become internecine, secret, exclusive and authoritarian,\" said one woman. \"They talk about equality and justice, but the reality is that there has been a pogrom.\" The deliberate lack of structure is deeply confusing to the police. \"Basically anyone who wants to organise something on May Day can call themselves what they want and do it,\" says Dave, who has been involved in radical street politics for seven years. \"In the past people have gone under the umbrella term of Reclaim the Streets, but this is changing, too. They're advertising it as a fun day out, but I wouldn't take my family as I did last year.\" RTS was never a formal organisation, one reason why the police, with their strict ranks and layers of bureaucracy, found it so hard to comprehend. But since the mayhem in Westminster last year, which led to the prime minister declaring that such behaviour must never happen again, undercover special branch officers have been desperately trying to gather more reliable intelligence, even asking disaffected RTS people to grass on their former friends. They have given no information. Some of what the police have discovered chimes with the views of the veteran demonstrators. \"We know we're not dealing with Reclaim the Streets any more,\" said one senior officer. \"We seem to have a new, tougher breed on our hands. \"Their aim is violence against property and police officers because that is the best way to get media attention. Some people who were encouraging violence within RTS have fanned out and started their own loosely knit organisations, but we don't know what support, if any, they have.\" Special branch has been taking a long, hard look at the Anarchist Federation, Solidarity Federation, the Birmingham Section 26 Collective and the Urban Alliance. Two weeks ago, the Met raided an empty factory in Brixton, south-west London, which was supposedly a secret training camp for another radical group, the Wombles - \"White Overall Movement Building Liberation Through Effective Struggle\". Wombles The Wombles style themselves on Ya Basta!, a highly disciplined and principled non-violent direct action Italian support group for the Zapatista rebels in Mexico. Wearing all white and using water pistols and mock weapons, Ya Basta! march with foam battering rams to pass through police lines. Prominent in Prague at the IMF/World Bank conference, they impressed many British activists who are thought to have have copied the idea. The British version of Ya Basta! has no formal connection with the Zapatistas. In one sense, the discovery was a coup for Scotland Yard. But although one white overall was found, and some graffiti (\"Smash Police Skull\"), there was little else to suggest it was a current training camp. The Wombles, whoever they are, had moved on. One protester, who claimed to be a Womble, was withering about the police raid. \"If we wanted violence, we wouldn't be marching on May Day with water pistols, inflatable hammers and a 50ft inflatable Uncle Bulgaria,\" the protester said. \"Even our name was a piss-take, but the fact that they are taking us so seriously is a joke on them. When they talk about sinister hardcore paramilitary Wombles, they look ridiculous.\" The police are not giving too much away at this stage. They have \"an intelligence picture\", built up by covert operations led by Special Branch and MI5, but do not know how accurate or clear it is. The Met's assistant commissioner Mike Todd, who is in overall charge of May Day policing this year, was candid enough to admit this week that none of the ringleaders of last year's trouble had been caught. There is concern that the protests that have been heavily flagged on the internet and in the May Day Monopoly game guide pamphlet will not be the focus of any trouble. \"Is there a hidden agenda?\", said an officer. \"We don't think so. But we cannot be sure.\" By sabre-rattling at this stage, the police are hoping to make trouble-makers think twice before coming at all. \"We have intelligence on certain individuals who we think are pulling the strings behind the scenes, but we do not have evidence,\" said one officer. \"We think we know who they are. Intelligence can help us prepare, but it won't get someone arrested. Intelligence can also be wrong. We won't really know what we're dealing with until the day.\" On the road to violence May 14 1995 500 anti-road protesters take over a half-mile stretch of Camden High Street in north London for a giant open-air party as part of a campaign to reclaim the streets for pedestrians and cyclists. Police arrest three people for public order offences July 23 1995 A lunchtime protest takes over Upper Street, Islington, one of north London's busiest roads. By early evening riot police move in to clear the road and sporadic fights break out as the 200 protesters are driven towards King's Cross station. Windows are smashed and bottles and cans are thrown at police as the protesters flee the area July 13 1996 Thousands of road protesters create traffic chaos in west London by holding a mass street party on the M41 at Shepherd's Bush. Activists set up 20ft-high steel tripods to block approaches to the M41 from the A40 Westway into central London August 24 1996 Eighty people are arrested as hundreds of police in riot gear clash with anti-road protesters on the Brighton seafront. Police foil an attempt by Reclaim the Streets to hold a street party in the middle of the East Sussex seaside town, seizing sound equipment, a van full of scaffolding poles, and an uninflated bouncy castle June 18 1999 Violence flares in the heart of the City of London as 4,000 protesters descend for the \"carnival against capitalism\". Police are attacked with bricks and concrete blocks and \u00a32m worth of damage is caused to shops and offices. Eight demonstrators enter Lloyds Bank in Cheapside and some chain themselves inside May 1 2000 Five thousand people attend a largely peaceful \"guerrilla gardening\" event in central London, planting flowers and building ponds in Parliament Square. Violence erupts when anarchist protesters attack a McDonald's restaurant and there are sporadic clashes with riot police across the city. Churchill's statue is daubed with red paint and a mohican \"haircut\" of turf is placed on the wartime leader's head Laura Milne",

He was now an ex-coach. Thus this week, instead of handing out advice and bananas at the side of the court, he has found himself on the sofa at home, flicking through Teletext to check on how the player he had once thought of as his boy was performing. The words \"by mutual consent\" were used in the announcement of their split - a euphemism, we can only assume. </p> <p>\"Not at all,\" says Felgate when I tracked him down to his home this week, where he was presumably hoping for a more exciting phone call than one from a nosy journalist. \"We felt it was the right decision for everyone.\" </p> <p>Which, as an assessment from someone who has effectively received his P45, veers on the manic side of positive. </p> <p>\"Have you ever had that feeling in the stomach when you know something's right?\" he adds. \"Well, it was like that. Look, Tim and I got on really, really well. Still do. It is a very intense relationship between a tennis player and a coach; we probably saw more of each other than we did of our wives. But we had been talking for more than six months and, although the subject of a break wasn't actually raised, we knew that was what was on each other's minds. It was right.\" </p> <p>And so, on Sunday, after Great Britain's Davis Cup match with Portugal, they split. But while the parting may have been amicable, it was by no means equitable. Henman carried on playing, winning his first match without a coach at the Estoril Open on Tuesday. For Felgate everything was different. He was unemployed. </p> <p>\"I'm sure he will have found it strange too, without me at the courtside,\" Felgate says. \"But you have to remember that it is just tennis. Yes, of course it was an emotional relationship, intense, all those things. But I still have my health and my marriage.\" </p> <p>Still, how does Felgate feel about those within tennis who thought the split was not before time? John McEnroe, for instance, after Henman had lost in the first round of the US Open in 1999, was unequivocal in his advice: if the player wanted to go on and dominate tournaments, he was going to have to ditch Felgate. And, if he could not dismiss a man who was his oldest friend in tennis, then the coach should recognise his shortcomings, do the honourable thing and walk away. </p> <p>\"Most people are good at criticising when a match has been lost,\" he says, volleying the McEnroe verbal forehand. \"I've always been a firm believer that coaches coach and players play. I wasn't much of a player. John was a great. But then he didn't have huge success as America's Davis Cup coach, did he? No, people are entitled to opinions. I only get upset when they get the facts wrong.\" </p> <p>Felgate seems remarkably chipper, a commercial for the advice he always gave his player: think positive. The hard times, though, may be to come. Henman might go on to win Wimbledon. And the first thing a thousand commentators will suggest is that McEnroe's advice was bang on target: the player won because he ditched his coach. </p> <p>\"And they'd be right,\" says Felgate. \"As I say, I prefer facts. And, if he wins Wimbledon, it would be a fact that he made the right decision to break with me.\" </p> <p>And if he does not? </p> <p>\"Well, it wouldn't mean he made the wrong one. There are many factors involved.\" </p> <p>Whatever Henman does in the future - win, lose or lose again - he knows where he is going: back on court. For Felgate, his long-time partner on the line, things are less clear. </p> <p>\"I've had some offers,\" he says. \"But it has to be right. The relationship between a player and his coach is so delicate, you have to be sure.\" </p> <p>And, if he needs any help finding someone else to nurture, Felgate could always seek the assistance of his wife, Jan. She is a players' agent, though one of her clients may not be of much use right now. It is Tim Henman.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The United States adopted a markedly more aggressive stance towards China yesterday over the circumstances of the mid-air spy plane collision and future Sino-US ties following the 11-day standoff.</p> <p>With the 24 crew members now back in the US - they fly to Washington state later today for a reunion with their relatives - American officials began to give a very different version of the incident from the one put out by Beijing.</p> <p>The defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, said yesterday that the spy plane was flying straight and level until a Chinese fighter pilot, \"manoeuvring aggressively\" in the skies above the South China sea, struck the US aircraft from below. He said Chinese pilots had been buzzing US planes for months.</p> <p>Contradicting Chinese reports, Mr Rumsfeld said the crew attempted to issue 25-30 Mayday signals and landed in distress. He said the crew was greeted by armed Chinese troops.</p> <p>\"The Chinese pilots have been manoeuvring aggressively against our pilots for months,\" he said, citing 44 recent cases. \"The F-8 pilot clearly put at risk the lives of 24 Americans.\"</p> <p>Mr Rumsfeld also said a major portion of the sensitive data and equipment on board had been destroyed by the US crew, as they are trained to do.</p> <p>He added that Chinese officials were armed when they \"invited the crew off the aircraft\". Showing some diplomacy, Mr Rumsfeld said: \"I don't know that their guns were even taken out of the holsters.\"</p> <p>The US decision to challenge the Chinese version of events so promptly came after President George Bush, in remarks at the White House on Thursday, adopted an abrasive tone largely rejected by the US while the crew remained in China.</p> <p>The dispute did \"not advance a constructive relationship\" between the two countries, Mr Bush said. Detaining the crew was \"inconsistent\" with a positive relationship between the US and China.</p> <p>Both countries now had to make \"a determined choice to have a productive relationship\".</p> <p>The two sides are due to meet to discuss the details of the April 1 incident and its implications on Wednesday.</p> <p>Claiming to speak on the basis of early debriefings with the returned crew, an official told the Washington Post that a Chinese fighter had caused the accident by clipping an engine on the EP-3 spy plane.</p> <p>The US plane very nearly plunged into the South China sea, the official said. The Chinese fighter was less fortunate.</p> <p>The US officials said that they were now \"more convinced than before that the Chinese pilot caused the accident. The US plane was flying on autopilot at the time of the clash and was on a straight and level course in clear visibility\".</p> <p>China contends that the US plane veered to the left, colliding with the Chinese F-8 jet.</p> <p>\"There was no sudden turn,\" a Pentagon official said. Instead the F-8 made two passes of the spy plane, coming within three to five feet of its left wing.</p> <p>\"On the third pass, he came in too fast. He tried to decelerate by bringing up his nose, which would bleed off speed. But when that happened, he lost some fine control and his tail came up under the No 1 propeller.\"</p> <p>The collision with the propellor broke the F-8 into two pieces and debris smashed into the nose of the EP-3, causing the cone to break off and hit a second propeller on the right wing. These incidents tipped the EP-3 on its side for a period until the pilot regained control and landed on Hainan island.</p> <p>\"Our assessment is this wasn't a deliberate act in any way of coming out to try to ram the EP-3, it was a rendezvous that was not accomplished very well,\" said a US diplomat in Beijing yesterday.</p> <p>China has repeatedly said that the crippled plane had violated its airspace by landing on Hainan without permission.</p> <p>But the diplomat said that the pilot had sent out distress calls on frequencies used by all aircraft. \"Aircraft and towers are supposed to monitor the guard frequencies all the time to listen up for aircraft in distress,\" the diplomat said.</p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/china/\">China</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/bush/\">George Bush's America</a></p> <p><b>Related stories</b><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/china/story/0,7369,472456,00.html\">12.04.2001: Plane crew back on US soil</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/china/story/0,7369,472176,00.html\">12.04.2001: Air crew fly back to 'very sorry' US</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/china/story/0,7369,472093,00.html\">12.04.2001: Long-term goals sway Chinese</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/china/story/0,7369,472102,00.html\">12.04.2001: No crowing when Bush breaks news</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/china/story/0,7369,472027,00.html\">12.04.2001, comment: The hostile panda</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/china/story/0,7369,472088,00.html\">12.04.2001, leader: Right result for the US</a></p> <p><b>Audio</b><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0412kettle.ra\">Spy crew homecoming 'a major media event'</a><br>Americans love nothing more than returning military personnel, reports Martin Kettle in Washington DC.

The defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, said yesterday that the spy plane was flying straight and level until a Chinese fighter pilot, \"manoeuvring aggressively\" in the skies above the South China sea, struck the US aircraft from below. He said Chinese pilots had been buzzing US planes for months. Contradicting Chinese reports, Mr Rumsfeld said the crew attempted to issue 25-30 Mayday signals and landed in distress. He said the crew was greeted by armed Chinese troops. \"The Chinese pilots have been manoeuvring aggressively against our pilots for months,\" he said, citing 44 recent cases. \"The F-8 pilot clearly put at risk the lives of 24 Americans.\" Mr Rumsfeld also said a major portion of the sensitive data and equipment on board had been destroyed by the US crew, as they are trained to do. He added that Chinese officials were armed when they \"invited the crew off the aircraft\". Showing some diplomacy, Mr Rumsfeld said: \"I don't know that their guns were even taken out of the holsters.\" The US decision to challenge the Chinese version of events so promptly came after President George Bush, in remarks at the White House on Thursday, adopted an abrasive tone largely rejected by the US while the crew remained in China. The dispute did \"not advance a constructive relationship\" between the two countries, Mr Bush said. Detaining the crew was \"inconsistent\" with a positive relationship between the US and China. Both countries now had to make \"a determined choice to have a productive relationship\". The two sides are due to meet to discuss the details of the April 1 incident and its implications on Wednesday. Claiming to speak on the basis of early debriefings with the returned crew, an official told the Washington Post that a Chinese fighter had caused the accident by clipping an engine on the EP-3 spy plane. The US plane very nearly plunged into the South China sea, the official said. The Chinese fighter was less fortunate. The US officials said that they were now \"more convinced than before that the Chinese pilot caused the accident. The US plane was flying on autopilot at the time of the clash and was on a straight and level course in clear visibility\". China contends that the US plane veered to the left, colliding with the Chinese F-8 jet. \"There was no sudden turn,\" a Pentagon official said. Instead the F-8 made two passes of the spy plane, coming within three to five feet of its left wing. \"On the third pass, he came in too fast. He tried to decelerate by bringing up his nose, which would bleed off speed. But when that happened, he lost some fine control and his tail came up under the No 1 propeller.\" The collision with the propellor broke the F-8 into two pieces and debris smashed into the nose of the EP-3, causing the cone to break off and hit a second propeller on the right wing. These incidents tipped the EP-3 on its side for a period until the pilot regained control and landed on Hainan island. \"Our assessment is this wasn't a deliberate act in any way of coming out to try to ram the EP-3, it was a rendezvous that was not accomplished very well,\" said a US diplomat in Beijing yesterday. China has repeatedly said that the crippled plane had violated its airspace by landing on Hainan without permission. But the diplomat said that the pilot had sent out distress calls on frequencies used by all aircraft. \"Aircraft and towers are supposed to monitor the guard frequencies all the time to listen up for aircraft in distress,\" the diplomat said.

      "bodyText": "Governor Jeb Bush has written to his brother, President George Bush, asking him to suspend federal environmental regulations which ensure that Florida has safe drinking water. Rapid population growth in the low-lying state, which now has 16 million inhabitants and low levels of underground fresh water, will cause a serious risk of water shortages in Florida unless the restrictions are lifted, Governor Bush says. State officials want to allow billions of gallons of untreated and partly contaminated rain and river water to be injected underground to help form underground reservoirs. Such action would save Florida millions of dollars in water treatment costs, although officials say \"extensive precautions\" would be taken to avoid any health danger. If the plan goes ahead, however, the federal government's environmental protection agency would have to waive rules which require that any water pumped into the ground must first be treated to meet drinking water standards. In his letter, Jeb Bush called the requirement \"nonsensical\". He said the stored water would be treated before it was fed into the drinking water system and asked for \"a willingness to abandon conventional processes as long as the environmental results are achieved\". Opponents say the governor's plan risks feeding untested water into private wells, where drinking water is not always treated and that the pumping process risks creating unforeseen hazards. \"This is something that really has not been studied yet with respect to the injection of untreated surface water. I think the state could be opening the door to a lot of problems,\" said John Vecchioli of the US geological service. Florida's population is projected to reach more than 20m by 2020 and experts say that the state faces a water deficit of up to 30 per cent by then.

He died later from head injuries.</p> <p>The attack took place in his home town of Avtury, in a region of Chechnya south-east of Grozny ostensibly under Russian control - demonstrating again the weakness of Russia's grip on the region.</p> <p>Mr Deniyev is the most powerful pro-Moscow official in Chechnya to have been assassinated during the course of the war.</p> <p>Chechen rebels claim to have compiled a death list containing all the names of officials in Chechnya appointed by the Russian government. Any Chechen who agrees to work for the Russian-imposed local government is viewed as a traitor by separatist fighters and is vulnerable to attack. Several have already been killed.</p> <p>The murdered administrator was appointed by the Kremlin to help restore stability to the separatist republic, shattered by two devastating wars over the past decade. Akhmad Kadyrov, his direct superior and head of the pro-Moscow administration, immediately blamed the Chechen rebel leader Aslan Maskhadov for the killing.</p> <p>Mr Kadyrov, who has survived several assassination attempts, claimed that both he and Mr Deniyev had received threats from Mr Maskhadov. \"This is another act of terrorism. They have killed somebody who was trying by every means possible to restore normal life to Chechnya,\" he said.</p> <p>This attempt to cast the dead official as a blameless agent for the future good of Chechnya was dismissed by Chechen experts in Moscow. Mr Deniyev had himself been accused of murder and was widely believed to be collaborating with the Russian security forces, the FSB.</p> <p>He was named as a suspect in a 1999 US state department report in the murder of six Red Cross nurses. The nurses were discovered shot dead in their beds in Chechnya in 1996. At the time, Russian officials blamed the killings on Chechen rebels, but the murders remained unsolved.</p> <p>Andrei Babitsky, the Radio Liberty reporter who disappeared for a month last year after Russian troops handed him over to Chechen rebels in a bizarre prisoner exchange, said after his release that he had not ended up in rebel hands but been imprisoned in Mr Deniyev's house.</p> <p>The journalist, whose critical coverage of the conflict in Chechnya infuriated the Kremlin, said he was held by pro-Moscow Chechens under Mr Deniyev's orders until international pressure apparently prompted the Russian government to order his release.</p> <p>Mr Maskhadov swiftly denied responsibility for the killing yesterday. \"The Chechen leadership offers its condolences to the FSB, which has lost an important collaborator in Deniyev,\" a spokesman said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The fragile pro-Kremlin administration in Chechnya suffered a new blow yesterday with the assassination of its deputy leader in a bomb attack on a local television studio. Adam Deniyev was fatally injured when a bomb exploded in the studio where he was broadcasting a live reading from the Koran on Thursday evening. He died later from head injuries. The attack took place in his home town of Avtury, in a region of Chechnya south-east of Grozny ostensibly under Russian control - demonstrating again the weakness of Russia's grip on the region. Mr Deniyev is the most powerful pro-Moscow official in Chechnya to have been assassinated during the course of the war. Chechen rebels claim to have compiled a death list containing all the names of officials in Chechnya appointed by the Russian government. Any Chechen who agrees to work for the Russian-imposed local government is viewed as a traitor by separatist fighters and is vulnerable to attack. Several have already been killed. The murdered administrator was appointed by the Kremlin to help restore stability to the separatist republic, shattered by two devastating wars over the past decade. Akhmad Kadyrov, his direct superior and head of the pro-Moscow administration, immediately blamed the Chechen rebel leader Aslan Maskhadov for the killing. Mr Kadyrov, who has survived several assassination attempts, claimed that both he and Mr Deniyev had received threats from Mr Maskhadov. \"This is another act of terrorism. They have killed somebody who was trying by every means possible to restore normal life to Chechnya,\" he said. This attempt to cast the dead official as a blameless agent for the future good of Chechnya was dismissed by Chechen experts in Moscow. Mr Deniyev had himself been accused of murder and was widely believed to be collaborating with the Russian security forces, the FSB. He was named as a suspect in a 1999 US state department report in the murder of six Red Cross nurses. The nurses were discovered shot dead in their beds in Chechnya in 1996. At the time, Russian officials blamed the killings on Chechen rebels, but the murders remained unsolved. Andrei Babitsky, the Radio Liberty reporter who disappeared for a month last year after Russian troops handed him over to Chechen rebels in a bizarre prisoner exchange, said after his release that he had not ended up in rebel hands but been imprisoned in Mr Deniyev's house. The journalist, whose critical coverage of the conflict in Chechnya infuriated the Kremlin, said he was held by pro-Moscow Chechens under Mr Deniyev's orders until international pressure apparently prompted the Russian government to order his release. Mr Maskhadov swiftly denied responsibility for the killing yesterday. \"The Chechen leadership offers its condolences to the FSB, which has lost an important collaborator in Deniyev,\" a spokesman said.",

The new row broke out after the museum announced it was abandoning a public commitment to publish controversial academic papers submitted by contributors to an international symposium held at the British Museum to discuss the issue. The symposium was meant to end the secrecy that surrounded the \"cleaning\" of the Elgin Marbles with wire brushes and chisels in the 1930s, which caused irreparable damage to them. Greek academics and the historian, William St Clair - a prominent critic of the museum's handling of the issue - had been invited to debate with supporters of the museum in London in December 1999. The museum said it would publish all the contributions from the symposium as part of wider dissemination of the issue. It also told Unesco the reports would be circulated. Unesco has taken a special interest in the future of the marbles and would like to see them returned to Athens. Last month the museum abruptly cancelled publication of the contributions, blaming four Greek academics for failing to meet a year-long deadline to submit their papers. But in the meantime the museum had become embroiled in another row with Mr St Clair over his submission - which they claimed was \"derogatory\" towards the museum - and sought to change his paper before they would agree to publication. Dyfri Williams, keeper of Greek and Roman antiquities at the museum, wrote to Mr St Clair accusing him of having \"submitted a considerably expanded and reworked version of his address\". Dr Williams said: \"Your submission is far too long... in many places throughout your text you employ what some might consider unsubstantiated innuendo or invective.

In Valladolid the sense of a common view and purpose in life is tangible. People instinctively seem to belong together.

That light is a person: Jesus, the Christ. \"I was born for this, I came into the world for this: to bear witness to the truth.\" (John ch18 v37).</p> <p>With these words our search for understanding changes. Now it can be conducted in that form of search which best fits our nature. The search for truth becomes a relationship. In faith we can know Christ. In that relationship the light he casts on human nature comes into my life. In that light I begin to untangle the mystery of my own being. I am led towards the very source of life.</p> <p>The streets and the squares of Valladolid have been thronged with crowds every day this week as the drama of the passion, death and resurrection of Christ has been played out in great outdoor pageants. Jesus greeted by jubilant crowds waving palms; Peter denying Christ, and then meeting him again; Veronica wiping the face of Jesus; Mary brokenhearted at the foot of the cross; Jesus dying on the cross.</p> <p>These pageants are carried out without words. They go beyond words. They are ancient and moving expressions of the story still written in the hearts and minds of the people. And the story tells the truth. It tells the truth about living and dying, about sin and forgiveness, about love and compassion. The truth holds the people together. And life is more wholesome.</p> <p>Perhaps the story - the Easter story - is largely forgotten, or has never been heard, by many people in Britain today. Yet the need for its message is as plain as ever. Beneath the noise of much activity and many distractions, the rumbling need in many hearts can almost be heard. It echoes in an empty space that only God can fill. But for that to happen, so many myths and misunderstandings have to be cleared away. This is the purpose of the coming of Christ, the purpose of the climax of his life and of his death celebrated at Easter: that we might know the truth and, knowing it, rejoice.</p> <p>\u0095 The Most Rev Vincent Nichols is Roman Catholic Archbishop of Birmingham</p>",

In faith we can know Christ. In that relationship the light he casts on human nature comes into my life. In that light I begin to untangle the mystery of my own being. I am led towards the very source of life. The streets and the squares of Valladolid have been thronged with crowds every day this week as the drama of the passion, death and resurrection of Christ has been played out in great outdoor pageants. Jesus greeted by jubilant crowds waving palms; Peter denying Christ, and then meeting him again; Veronica wiping the face of Jesus; Mary brokenhearted at the foot of the cross; Jesus dying on the cross. These pageants are carried out without words. They go beyond words. They are ancient and moving expressions of the story still written in the hearts and minds of the people. And the story tells the truth. It tells the truth about living and dying, about sin and forgiveness, about love and compassion. The truth holds the people together. And life is more wholesome. Perhaps the story - the Easter story - is largely forgotten, or has never been heard, by many people in Britain today. Yet the need for its message is as plain as ever. Beneath the noise of much activity and many distractions, the rumbling need in many hearts can almost be heard. It echoes in an empty space that only God can fill. But for that to happen, so many myths and misunderstandings have to be cleared away. This is the purpose of the coming of Christ, the purpose of the climax of his life and of his death celebrated at Easter: that we might know the truth and, knowing it, rejoice. \u0095 The Most Rev Vincent Nichols is Roman Catholic Archbishop of Birmingham",

It has been empty since 1948, a victim of the conflict between Arabs and Israelis. It is a quiet spot. The stone is old, and the columns and curves belong to a very different architectural tradition from the red-roofed modern Israeli houses that surround it.</p> <p>Today, there are new ruins. This week, the Israeli army bulldozed 30 homes, adding to the many already destroyed elsewhere in the Gaza Strip and on the West Bank. The Palestinians are paying a heavy price for the uprising they began in September: more than 370 dead and an economy destroyed.</p> <p>The response of most Israeli liberals is to agree that the Palestinians are suffering but that the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, is to blame: he should have accepted the peace proposals put to him by the then Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, and the then US president, Bill Clinton, at Camp David last year and at Taba earlier this year. It is a view widely shared internationally, and one that the Israeli government is happy to project: that a generous deal was put on the table for Arafat and he missed the historic opportunity. The reality is that it may turn out to be Israel's missed opportunity.</p> <p>There are two basic Israeli views of how to deal with its neighbour, the future state of Palestine. There is the liberal version put forward by the Israeli foreign minister, Shimon Peres, of an economically healthy Israel co-existing alongside an equally economically healthy Palestinian state. Together they could be at the centre of a revitalised Middle East.</p> <p>Unfortunately, it is the other Israeli view that has long been dominant and is prevalent today: to have a weak, malleable Palestinian neighbour. Thomas Friedman, the New York Times journalist, writes in his account of his 10 years in the Middle East, From Beirut To Jerusalem, about how the Israelis have never quite managed to give up hopes of controlling all of biblical Israel, which includes the West Bank. That is what motivates the movement of Jewish settlers out into the Palestinian Wild West, the source of most of today's conflict.</p> <p>Friedman and a host of other journalists and academics have recorded how Israeli politicians since the founding of the state in 1948 have talked peace while grabbing land. While Barak put seemingly generous offers on the table, Jewish settlers continued to expand into the West Bank, which they call by the biblical name, Judea and Samaria.</p> <p>Demographic maps of the Middle East since 1948, the year Israel was founded, show a steady expansion of the Jewish population eastwards. Arab East Jerusalem today is being gradually surrounded by Jewish homes. Even within Jerusalem's Old City, Israelis are spreading into Arab neighbourhoods.</p> <p>A Palestinian this week, spotting for the first time new Jewish houses on the outskirts of Jerusalem, said: \"It is like a magic wand. You go away for a few weeks and then suddenly there is a whole new place.\" The Israeli government, supposedly committed to no new settlements, announced this week a further 700 new houses. The Israeli government finds it easy to keep to its commitment to build no new settlements: because there are so many already on the West Bank, all it has to do is just keep expanding existing ones.</p> <p>It is against this background that Barak's \"generous\" deal should be seen. The Israelis portrayed it as the Palestinians receiving 96% of the West Bank. But the figure is misleading. The Israelis did not include parts of the West Bank they had already appropriated.</p> <p>The Palestine that would have emerged from such a settlement would not have been viable. It would have been in about half-a-dozen chunks, with huge Jewish settlements in between - a Middle East Bantustan. The Israeli army would also have retained the proposed Palestinian state's eastern border, the Jordan valley, for six to 10 years and, more significantly, another strip along the Dead Sea coast for an unspecified period: so much for being an independent state.</p> <p>Israel could afford to be magnanimous in terms of territory, given the amount it has gained over the last century at the expense of the Palestinians, many of whom fled or abandoned their homes for Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and elsewhere.</p> <p>Compromises were discussed at Camp David and Taba on the right of return of the 3.5m Palestinian refugees, but nothing that Arafat could take away to sell to his own people. In spite of the protestations of Israeli liberals such as Amos Oz that to allow back 3.5m Palestinians would be suicidal for Israel, a solution was possible. The Israeli view that 3.5m Palestinian refugees would flood into Israel is a nonsense. What the Palestinians are looking for is something akin to an apology from the Israelis for taking their land. Israel could allow a few hundred thousand back and pay - or get the US or Japan or Europe to pay - compensation to the remainder, most of whom would stay where they now live.</p> <p>One proposal on the table was for a land swap: the Palestinians would get part of Israel proper next to the West Bank in return for Israel taking part of the West Bank. Arafat could have taken this deal to the refugees and said: \"Look, you are going back to Israel, as I promised.\" Barak could just as easily have said: \"Look, it is no longer Israel but the West Bank.\" Solutions were possible, but in the end Barak would not give on the right of return.</p> <p>A genuinely generous offer by Barak might have secured peace. That was the missed historic opportunity. If Israel had been more magnanimous at Camp David, it could have had the greater prize of long-term stability.</p> <p>There is a huge danger attached to the Israeli view that Arafat spurned a great offer. Accepting this version perpetuates the Israeli myth that the Palestinians will not be happy until the Jews are pushed back into the sea and that the West Bank and Gaza are full of gunmen and bombers intent on making that happen.</p> <p>There are such people - but most Palestinians are interested less in the destruction of Israel than in establishing a proper Palestinian state. Most are as exercised about the poor quality of the leadership round Arafat and about the endemic corruption and lack of democracy in their own society as they are about Israel. What they want is for the Israeli army to go home and to take the Jewish settlers with them. There will be no peace until that happens.</p> <p>Nothing in the career of the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, suggests he will do that. Instead, he will continue with the subjugation of the Palestinians and grabbing more of their land. The only safe bet is that there are going to be a lot more Palestinian ruins.</p> <p>Ewen MacAskill is the Guardian's diplomatic editor <br><a href=\"mailto:ewen.macaskill@theguardian.com\">ewen.macaskill@theguardian.com</a><br></p> <p><b>Audio report</b><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0411goldenberg.ra\">Suzanne Goldenberg in Khan Yunis, Gaza Strip </a></p> <p><b>Interactive</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/wto/flash/0,6189,382165,00.html\" target=\"_new\">Israeli map</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/wto/flash/0,6189,380125,00.html\" target=\"_new\">History of Israel</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b> <br><a href=\"\u0094http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,472191,00.html\u0094\">12.04.2001: You\u0092ve just been visited by the Israeli army</a><br><a href=\"\u0094http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,471931,00.html\u0094\">11.04.2001: Tanks attack Palestinian refugee site</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,470986,00.html\">10.04.2001: Israel's reservists 'refusing to serve in West Bank'</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/elsewhere/journalist/story/0,7792,470783,00.html\">09.04.2001, World dispatch: Israel wins war of words</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,469969,00.html\">07.04.2001: The dove patrolling on the hawk's wing</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,469378,00.html\">06.04.2001: Israeli phone bomb kills militant</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.middleeastwire.com/\" target=\"_new\" http: www.austarab.com.au arab_league \">Member countries of the Arab League</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.ptimes.com/\" target=\"_new\">Palestine Times</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.jordantimes.com/Mon/\" target=\"_new\">Jordan Times</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.info.gov.il/eng/min-pmo.htm\" target=\"_new\">Israeli government</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.pna.net/\" target=\"_new\">Palestinian National Authority</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Cincinnati is braced for renewed protests and violence today when the funeral is held of the young man whose killing by police sparked days of rioting. The rites for Timothy Thoma, 19, in the inner-city area of Over-the-Rhine will be a real test of efforts to restore order to the Ohio city, which is now under curfew from 8pm to 6am. The introduction of the curfew on Thursday night restored some peace yesterday, putting a firebreak in place after three nights of violence and loot ing triggered by the shooting of Thomas a week ago. More than 150 people were arrested overnight for curfew violations, with 63 arrests for other offences, but the streets remained calm. The Cincinnati police chief, Thomas Streicher, whose force has been the focus of increasingly violent protests since the killing, said the city was returning to normal. Thomas was the 15th black man to be shot dead by Cincinnati police since 1995 in a city where 40% of the population is black. There was no attempt by city officials to claim that America's latest urban crisis was anywhere near over. \"It seems to be working, but it's a very tenuous circumstance,\" said the Cincinnati mayor, Charles Luken, who declared a state of emergency in his city on Thursday. \"I have lived in this city all of my life and I love it to death,\" Mr Luken said. \"I never thought I would sign an emergency order because of civil unrest.\" A move by some black citizens to defy the curfew was abandoned when the president of the National Associated for the Advance ment of Coloured People, Kweisi Mfume, used a megaphone to urge a reluctant crowd to go home. The incident that sparked the week of upheaval came in the early hours of April 7 when two off-duty policemen spotted Thomas, who was wanted on 12 charges of driving without a licence. A chase ensued, joined by 12 other policemen. One of them, Steve Roach, spotted Thomas jumping over a fence and shot him dead. Thomas was unarmed. Thomas had been stopped 11 separate times since March 2000 by police, mainly for suspected traffic offences.

Even the brashest of Hague advisers would shrink from sending out unsolicited pictures of Willie in baseball cap, Willie sinking his seventh pint etc. As for the prime minister, the Labour party surely fear electors would punish it for abusing their letter boxes. Mr Berlusconi is also reported to be giving his troops a pep talk on campaign manners. In the country of O Sole Mio, candidates should of course \"carry the sun in your pocket\". Any voters encountered in the piazza should be offered \"sincere compliments\" - in the case of men on their intelligence and on their beauty if they are women. (Don't expect many women in the Berlusconi cabinet unless they look like La Cicciolina.) Last year Forza told its people in the field always to carry a clean hankie and make sure their breath smelled sweet. Millbank may worry about facial hair and the general tidiness of candidates, but even in these regimented days, it is hard to imagine even New Labour aspirants taking instruction on how to avoid BO on the stump.",

      "bodyText": "Australian and South African forces have seized a fishing boat for poaching 100 tonnes of a fish so valuable it is known as \"White Gold\". After a 10-day chase across thousands of miles of ocean the Togo-registered boat, South Tommy, was caught with its illegal cargo of rare Patagonian toothfish estimated to be worth about \u00a3500,000 if sold as a delicacy in Japan and the US. Its 44 crew, believed to be Spanish, have been arrested. Patagonian toothfish grow to be more than two metres long, live for nearly 50 years and breed extremely slowly. Some have proteins that act as antifreeze to protect them in sub-zero waters. Fishing the toothfish is restricted because it is close to extinction as a commercial fish and because of the impact on the environment. The 150-foot South Tommy was first spotted by an Australian patrol boat nearly two weeks ago in Australian waters off Antarctica. A 2,500-mile chase ensued with the patrol vessel at times within a few hundred yards of its quarry. The Australians asked for South African help as the South Tommy approached the Cape of Good Hope. Pretoria dispatched three vessels to join the pursuit. The captain of the South Tommy allowed his vessel to be boarded on Thursday by 40 Australian troops on South African ships 250 miles off Cape Town. Australia's fisheries minister, Wilson Tuckey, said his navy was determined not to allow the South Tommy to escape. \"Had we not intercepted it when we did, it would have gone on until the fish stopped biting, so it would have ended up with 200 or 300 tonnes, which would have been tragic,\" he said. The captain faces a fine of up to \u00a3180,000 and the loss of the boat. Environmentalists say plunder of the toothfish has had a devastating effect on Antarctica's fragile ecosystem. The illegal trade in the fish is estimated to be worth about \u00a370m a year.",

      "body": "<p>Since his still unsolved murder in Las Vegas in 1996, the rapper and actor Tupac Shakur has assumed almost mythical status. Some grassroots Afro-American activists claim the FBI killed him. Public Enemy frontman Chuck D believes he's still alive. In west Africa, South Africa, Uganda and Zimbabwe, he is revered. \"He was a phenomenon and his legacy lingers on,\" says Sierra Leone journalist Lansana Fofany. \"He was so influential on youth in Africa.\" </p> <p>This week another Tupac album shot to the top of the US album charts. Until the End of Time, a double album of unfinished recordings re-produced and completed with the help of guest stars such as TLC's Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopez, follows last year's acclaimed The Rose That Grew From Concrete, a tribute album and book of lyrics. Even dead, Tupac can still shift units. </p> <p>During Sierra Leone's civil war, teenage members of the West Side Boyz militia scrawled his \"2PAC\" logo on the butts of their AK47s and sported Tupac T-shirts. \"It created so many problems that non-rebels could be arrested for wearing Tupac T-shirts,\" says Fofany. In West Side Boyz hideouts, they listened to Tupac's albums, focusing on his more violent lyrics. </p> <p>But although Tupac prided himself on having the lifestyle of a \"playa\" (high roller), he is also claimed as a poet and prophet. \"He's everyman,\" says Max Bankole Jarrett, a Liberian presenter with the BBC World Service's Network Africa show. \"He's full of contradictions, and that's where his power comes from.\" </p> <p>Tupac's lyrics were often misogynistic, and his reputation as a womaniser preceded him. In his book Got Your Back, his former bodyguard Frank Alexander claimed Janet Jackson insisted he take an Aids test before kissing her for the movie Poetic Justice. But in many of his lyrics he demonstrated a sensitivity and imagination that widened his appeal way beyond the \"THUG LIFE\" tattooed across his chest. \"Tupac represented the complexity of young black males in America,\" claims London-based music journalist and broadcaster Fusion. He refers to the searing social comment found on tracks such as Brenda's Got a Baby, from 2Pacalypse Now - about a pregnant 12-year-old: \"She didn't know what to throw away and what to keep/She wrapped the baby up and threw him in the trash heap/I guess she thought she'd get away/Wouldn't hear the cries/She didn't realise/How much that little baby had her eyes.\" </p> <p>Both hero and villain, Tupac epitomises the conflict between playa and poet that defines so many rappers. \"He was a study in contradiction - which I think most of us are if we're real,\" says Nayaba Arinde, an editor at New York's black daily newspaper The Daily Challenge. \"I wasn't crazy about how he spoke about women, and he knew better. But he was a product of his environment, and he told us that time and time again.\" </p> <p>Tupac was born Lesane Parish Crooks in Brooklyn in 1971. His mother, Afeni, renamed him Tupac Amaru (Shining Servant) Shakur (Thankful to God) when he was a small child. There are two candidates for the role of biological father: his stepfather, Mutulu Shakur, was a Black Panther, jailed in 1984 for an armoured car robbery. Afeni had been involved with the Panthers in New York and was also friends with \"Geronimo\" Pratt, a Panther who later spent 25 years in jail after being wrongly convicted of murder. </p> <p>At the age of 12, Tupac joined a Harlem theatre group and studied ballet and acting.

      "bodyText": "Since his still unsolved murder in Las Vegas in 1996, the rapper and actor Tupac Shakur has assumed almost mythical status. Some grassroots Afro-American activists claim the FBI killed him. Public Enemy frontman Chuck D believes he's still alive. In west Africa, South Africa, Uganda and Zimbabwe, he is revered. \"He was a phenomenon and his legacy lingers on,\" says Sierra Leone journalist Lansana Fofany. \"He was so influential on youth in Africa.\" This week another Tupac album shot to the top of the US album charts. Until the End of Time, a double album of unfinished recordings re-produced and completed with the help of guest stars such as TLC's Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopez, follows last year's acclaimed The Rose That Grew From Concrete, a tribute album and book of lyrics. Even dead, Tupac can still shift units. During Sierra Leone's civil war, teenage members of the West Side Boyz militia scrawled his \"2PAC\" logo on the butts of their AK47s and sported Tupac T-shirts. \"It created so many problems that non-rebels could be arrested for wearing Tupac T-shirts,\" says Fofany. In West Side Boyz hideouts, they listened to Tupac's albums, focusing on his more violent lyrics. But although Tupac prided himself on having the lifestyle of a \"playa\" (high roller), he is also claimed as a poet and prophet. \"He's everyman,\" says Max Bankole Jarrett, a Liberian presenter with the BBC World Service's Network Africa show. \"He's full of contradictions, and that's where his power comes from.\" Tupac's lyrics were often misogynistic, and his reputation as a womaniser preceded him. In his book Got Your Back, his former bodyguard Frank Alexander claimed Janet Jackson insisted he take an Aids test before kissing her for the movie Poetic Justice. But in many of his lyrics he demonstrated a sensitivity and imagination that widened his appeal way beyond the \"THUG LIFE\" tattooed across his chest. \"Tupac represented the complexity of young black males in America,\" claims London-based music journalist and broadcaster Fusion. He refers to the searing social comment found on tracks such as Brenda's Got a Baby, from 2Pacalypse Now - about a pregnant 12-year-old: \"She didn't know what to throw away and what to keep/She wrapped the baby up and threw him in the trash heap/I guess she thought she'd get away/Wouldn't hear the cries/She didn't realise/How much that little baby had her eyes.\" Both hero and villain, Tupac epitomises the conflict between playa and poet that defines so many rappers. \"He was a study in contradiction - which I think most of us are if we're real,\" says Nayaba Arinde, an editor at New York's black daily newspaper The Daily Challenge. \"I wasn't crazy about how he spoke about women, and he knew better. But he was a product of his environment, and he told us that time and time again.\" Tupac was born Lesane Parish Crooks in Brooklyn in 1971. His mother, Afeni, renamed him Tupac Amaru (Shining Servant) Shakur (Thankful to God) when he was a small child. There are two candidates for the role of biological father: his stepfather, Mutulu Shakur, was a Black Panther, jailed in 1984 for an armoured car robbery. Afeni had been involved with the Panthers in New York and was also friends with \"Geronimo\" Pratt, a Panther who later spent 25 years in jail after being wrongly convicted of murder. At the age of 12, Tupac joined a Harlem theatre group and studied ballet and acting. But crime and the politics of oppression dominated his youth - especially when his mother moved him in 1988 to Marin City, California, where he began to run with the wrong crowd. His mother struggled with crack addiction. None the less, Tupac became chairman of a youth group called the New Afrikan Panthers, performing plays at community centres. His first manager, Leila Steinberg, met him while reading Winnie Mandela's book Part of My Soul Went With Him in a park; Tupac appeared and announced: \"I love that book.\" He joined the group Digital Underground as a dancer, then rapper.

In the past, the palm has gone to great directors and theatre-makers such as Peter Brook, Giorgio Strehler, Robert Wilson and Lev Dodin. This year, refreshingly, the prize - 60,000 euros (around \u00a337,000) - went to the 75-year-old French actor Michel Piccoli, whose career is an object lesson in balancing stage and film. </p> <p>In Britain, Piccoli is best known for his work in movies by directors such as Luis Bunuel, Louis Malle, Jean-Luc Godard and Claude Chabrol, and for what Pauline Kael called his \"nuanced control\". But in France he is equally renowned as a stage actor. In recent years, he has played Gaev in Brook's Cherry Orchard, Leontes in The Winter's Tale and the title role in Ibsen's John Gabriel Borkman, as well as appearing in Marguerite Duras's La Maladie de la Mort for Robert Wilson. He is a classic example of how an actor can bring the same iron technique to two media without compromising himself in either. </p> <p>In Sicily we got only a tantalising glimpse of Piccoli's theatrical art. In Catania's handsomely baroque Bellini Theatre, he played the mysterious illusionist, Cotrone, in an hour-long reduction of Pirandello's The Mountain Giants. Cotrone, who has withdrawn from audiences and life, welcomes to his fantastic villa a group of travelling actors, here played by students and children. The staging, by Klaus- Michael Gruber,was rudimentary. But, roaming round the stage like a weary dancer in a black beret, Piccoli beautifully articulated Cotrone's solitude, sadness and Pirandellian belief in the deadening effect of reason - a far cry, it struck me, from Piccoli's own amiability and political radicalism. </p> <p>Piccoli represents the strength of a great acting tradition. But European theatre is rapidly changing, as shown by the work of the joint winners of Taormina's New Realities prize for more experimental work: Alain Platel and Heiner Goebbels. Last week I saw Platel's extraordinary choral spectacle, Because I Sing, at London's Roundhouse. In Taormina, his Ghent-based company staged Iets Op Bach, which blends dance, drama and music in a way that looks playfully anarchic but I suspect is rigorously controlled. Eight musicians and three singers present formally strict Bach pieces; meanwhile, nine acrobatic dancers offer a physical interpretation studded with violent Catholic imagery and harping on loss of childhood innocence. There are times when I resent the physical interference with the purity of Bach's music but, having seen two Platel shows in quick succession, I cannot doubt his visual wizardry. </p> <p>What Taormina confirmed, however, is that the theatrical barriers between text, mime, music, dance and video are crumbling fast. Goebbels presented a piece called The Left Hand of Glenn Gould, which used texts by Proust and Kafka, music from a variety of sources and close-up camerawork to explore the human face. It was totally unclassifiable, sometimes nerve-grating, but always intriguing. </p> <p>In Edinburgh this year Goebbels will be offering a musical spectacular based on Gertrude Stein.

      "body": "<p>It was 50 years ago that Keith Waterhouse first set foot in Fleet Street. He had travelled from his home in Leeds to be interviewed for a job as a reporter on the now defunct News Chronicle. It simply hadn't occurred to the 21-year-old that he might be rejected, but he realised something had gone wrong when the interview ended and he was told not to forget to send an invoice for his travel expenses. Before beginning the long journey back home, he walked down to Ludgate Circus to pay his respects at the plaque there commemorating Edgar Wallace, his hero. Wallace had sold newspapers on that spot as a boy before going on to be a journalist, Boer war correspondent, novelist, playwright and Hollywood script writer. This was the future the dejected Waterhouse thought he had just been excluded from. However, as he noted in his memoirs, in reality it was all just around the corner. </p> <p>\"How was I to know then that within months I should be established on Fleet Street,\" he wrote, \"that within three years I should be more familiar with New York, Washington, Moscow and Leningrad than I now was with London, that within four I should be turning down the post of the New Chronicle's chief reporter, that within five I should be publishing my first novel, and within 10 I should see my name in lights on Shaftesbury Avenue and on the cinema posters of Leicester Square?\" </p> <p>That catalogue of achievement takes him up to 1961, and since then there has been a great deal more of the same. He says the only thing Wallace did that he hasn't, is to own racehorses. Late last year Waterhouse was given a What the Papers Say lifetime achievement award. \"A bit unnerving,\" he recalls, before asking: \"Where to from there?\" But this is a rhetorical question. He has no intention of going anywhere. As far back as 1994, just before his 65th birthday, one observer noted that he had already passed through the stages of being a survivor, an anachronism, a dinosaur and a monument. Whatever his status, he just keeps chugging on and the novels, plays and journalism continue to pile up. </p> <p>His twice-weekly column in the Daily Mail, with its occasional cast of Dickensian-named bureaucrats, politicians, illiterates and the rest, is not to everyone's taste. Julie Burchill recently launched into him. \"There are many irritating things about the Daily Mail, but surely a contender for most irritating item is Keith Waterhouse's recurrent Sharon and Tracy column, in which two monumentally thick working-class shopgirls demonstrate that they have the IQ of a sock. From time to time, highly qualified young Sharons and Tracys write in to the paper and request that Waterhouse desists. But the tired old routine drags on and on. Can we imagine Waterhouse being allowed regularly to spoof two stupid, idle West Indians or Irishmen in his column, even in the Daily Mail? Of course not.\" </p> <p>Another attack came after he called William Hague a wimp for consulting Ffion. But none of this has stopped Waterhouse's lucid combination of fierce topicality and an encyclopaedic memory ensuring that he is still one of the best-read and best-paid columnists around. A good example was provided earlier this week when the travails of Sophie Wessex and Marks &amp; Spencer were thrown into the pot, along with flashbacks of 30s Leeds. </p> <p>Leading humorist and columnist Craig Brown shares many reservations about Waterhouse's approach, but notes that while, \"the Mail can swamp even the best writer because its own voice is so strong, nevertheless, at least once a month, Waterhouse does have an original idea which is more than most columnists can manage. I think the main thing is that he is quite a hero really. No one else has done a humorous column for such a long time, and so skilfully and with such an ease of style.\" </p> <p>Waterhouse's work in other mediums is similarly respected. As a novelist from the late 50s, his fiction, of which Billy Liar is still the best known, was seen as part of the revolt of the angry young men. He has now written 14 novels and academic and critic Richard Hoggart says: \"I very much admire his work. He's very talented and witty, quirky and outspoken.\" </p> <p>Ned Sherrin has directed five of Waterhouse's 20 plays, including the hugely successful Jeffrey Bernard is Unwell. He says that, \"there'll always be a place in the theatre for Billy Liar, and Celebration [his 1961 play written, like Billy Liar, with Willis Hall] will always be worth reviving. He has an instinctive stage craft. God knows where he picked it up.\" </p> <p>The best guess is somewhere in a working-class Leeds childhood that, Waterhouse perceptively notes, although packed with escapism, was in fact an escape into realism. He was transfixed by the nitty gritty of Leeds life, and his recollection of his adventures around the city invest the place with the same lyrical nostalgia that Woody Allen does to his childhood New York. Fellow Leeds boy Gerald Kaufman said Waterhouse's 1994 memoir, City Lights, gave back to him, \"the Leeds that I loved, the Leeds that time and change had taken away\". (Waterhouse had already complimented Kaufman with the sublimely backhanded observation that his book, My Life in the Silver Screen, was, \"the best volume of film-going memoirs ever written by a politician\".) </p> <p>Waterhouse was born in 1929 in a back-to-back house in the Hunslet area of the city. He was the youngest of four boys and a girl. His father, Ernest, was a heavy-drinking costermonger who sold vegetables from a cart in South Leeds and died when Waterhouse was aged three. His total estate was a brown suit and a ha'penny left in the pocket, which was given to the young Keith. These were the hungry 30s and the family was visited by bailiffs who took all the furniture except the mattresses and a stool for his mother, Elsie, to sit on. \"But we were richer than the poorest because my mother had a thing about shoes,\" he recalls. \"She thought shoes were respectable and boots were not - and clogs positively not. She got the shoes from the public benefit shoe company, so we were a shoe-wearing family, which was quite important.\" </p> <p>He says his mother was ambitious for her children, \"within her knowledge and limitations\". She once bought a book in French for his sister - \"I suppose she thought she would assimilate this language somehow\" - and when she found Keith wanted to write, she bought him notebooks. \"But with the greatest respect to my mother,\" he says, \"she had no idea who I was or what I was about. I was a bit of a cuckoo in the nest, and she was like the mother bird bringing worms home and not really knowing if cuckoos ate worms. She knew I was different, and she encouraged this difference without quite knowing what it was. For instance, she got me into school a year early, aged four, because I wouldn't stop reading.\" </p> <p>Despite this early academic promise, Waterhouse failed the 11- plus but, perversely, this put him in some pretty good company. The Leeds-born critic Richard Hoggart had failed the same exam, and so did Waterhouse's eventual writing partner, Willis Hall. However, at 13, Waterhouse won a scholarship to the local college of commerce where he came under the influence of a science teacher who had to teach English because of the wartime shortage of teachers. \"He would just chuck a book like Huckleberry Finn at me and say 'you might like this'.\" Although Waterhouse's mother had expected him to leave school at 14 to bring some money into the house, she allowed him to stay an extra 18 months. \"She wanted me 'to get on', as the phrase was,\" he says, but he was already contributing financially at home. \"I had at least five paper rounds, I sold firewood and I had a window-cleaning round, ground floor only because I didn't have a ladder. As a schoolboy, I was in fact earning at my height more than I earned in my first job.\" </p> <p>When he left school, he became a clerk in an undertakers-cum-surveyors, auctioneers and estate agents, who also hired out limousines. Years later it provided the setting for Billy Liar, but at this stage he says he was writing \"sub Wodehouse stories set in Mayfair. The idea of using a Leeds undertakers' parlour didn't cross my mind.\" </p> <p>Waterhouse's career as a writer was sealed when at 15 he sent a humorous piece about a conversation in a music shop to Punch. The editor wrote back saying \"not quite\" - \"which was as good as an acceptance from any other magazine\". So Waterhouse pressed his only copy of the typed manuscript under a damp towel with a flat iron, as he had been taught by the Writer magazine, and sent it off to a magazine called London Opinion. They paid him two guineas for it. </p> <p>His career as a journalist was put on hold when was called up for National Service in the RAF, but as soon as he was demobbed he fulfilled his ambition to be a reporter on the Yorkshire Evening Post. He says, looking back, his ambition was \"crazily optimistic\", but when he told his mother, \"she just accepted that I would be and I believed it totally as well. It was more arrogance than confidence, but I was the driven one of the family, although at the time I didn't know I was driving.\" </p> <p>A colleague on the paper was Barbara Taylor, now better known as the bestselling novelist Barbara Taylor Bradford. She remembers Waterhouse with, \"flaming red unruly hair rising up from his head\", kicking against the paper's owners, the Leeds Conservative Newspaper Company, by going round the corridors singing the Red Flag. He helped her with her copy and taught her how to manufacture an expense account. </p> <p>\"He'd say, 'Barbara, you're going to shame us with your two-and-six expenses and we've all put in for five quid',\" she recalls. \"He also used to borrow 10 shillings off me - which he always paid back - and take me to lunch in the Kardomah, where he'd regale me about how he was going to go to Fleet Street and going to write plays.\" In a neat illustration of how far they have both since travelled, the last time Waterhouse and Taylor met was at the Dorchester where they were chatting to the then prime minister, John Major. </p> <p>While all of his career ambitions were fulfilled long ago, Waterhouse still continues the routine he's had for the past 40 years: churning out the pages on an ancient Adler portable typewriter from the cluttered study he calls \"the word factory\" in his Earl's Court mansion flat home. He is not exactly taciturn, but there is a stillness and quietness, although friends insist that he is not in the least melancholy or lonely. He invariably answers questions in a single, neat sentence and says that writing is not something he likes doing, it is something he likes having done. \"It's what I do, it's what I am for. Whether I like it or not doesn't really come into it.\" </p> <p>Ned Sherrin says Waterhouse, \"gets up when the cock crows and does his work and so he is free for lunch. He doesn't eat a great deal but it is very celebratory. There's always that salad left untouched which he reckons he imbibes by osmosis.\" He likes to have a drink on the go most of the afternoon and evening, but says he never gets a hangover, nor missed a morning's work because of it. His first Fleet Street job was on the Daily Mirror in 1951. He joined within a few weeks of the legendary editor, Hugh Cudlipp, who \"kind of adopted me\", says Waterhouse. \"I learned a hell of a lot from him. It was a bit in the manner of my old English teacher throwing Huckleberry Finn at me, but he would throw assignments. He'd say 'go to the south of France and write about having a good time'. He was a great believer in bread and circuses. He would do the heavy politics and then say, 'that's enough of politics, let's have some fun in the paper', and I was involved in both sides.\" </p> <p>As a newsman, Waterhouse was a correspondent in America, Russia and Cyprus. With the close links between the Labour party high command and the Mirror, Waterhouse found himself drafting articles and speeches for Hugh Gaitskill and Harold Wilson. \"I never belonged to the Labour Party but I did dabble,\" he says. \"But I really go with my friend Richard Littlejohn on this. He says it's the task of the columnist to sit at the back throwing bottles, and I rather believe that.\" </p> <p>This approach seems calculated to bait a certain sort of politician. When Harriet Harman, as secretary of state for social security, was promoting after-school clubs for children, the example she gave of opposition to her ideas was a Waterhouse column. His view was that children should be, \"falling into ponds, eating poisonous berries, contracting stomach-ache from under-ripe stolen apples, getting lost, being bitten by dogs, fighting and starting fires, sitting in cowpats and acquiring bumps the size of a duck-egg on their heads\". Despite this flippancy, he has contributed to government education policy as a member of the Kingman Committee on teaching English in the mid 80s. </p> <p>Friends say that, while he can deliver the occasional stunning one-liners, he is more prone to a sort of surreal schoolboy humour. There are lots of stories of him behaving badly at party conferences. At one Blackpool Labour conference in the mid 70s, via a series of complicated bets, he won the trousers of a fellow reporter and then went round the bars introducing the trousers to various members of the Callaghan cabinet. Once in Venice he bought the entire stock of clockwork soldiers from a stall and marched them into the Grand Canal because he had seen a similar thing in a New Yorker cartoon. </p> <p>The distinguished former industrial editor of the Mirror, Geoffrey Goodman, says that while Waterhouse was often great fun to be with, he wasn't a regular in the Mirror pub, known as the Stab in the Back. \"He sought out his own territory and was much more inclined to hang around theatreland. He's only really at home with journalists if they are his mates.\" </p> <p>Wherever he hung around, it was for long enough to precipitate the end of his first marriage. He had met Joan Foster in Leeds when they were both 16, and they married at 21. Almost the first thing they did was move to London for the Mirror job and their three children were all born there. He says the marriage was not untypical of Fleet Street marriages of the time in that he didn't see his family for days on end. </p> <p>When the marriage finished in the mid 60s, he actually began to see more of his children with regular weekend and midweek dates, which continued well after they became adults. His son, Bob, is now the artistic director of a theatre in Buffalo, New York, and has staged a successful production of Jeffrey Bernard is Unwell. His daughter Sarah runs a picture-framing business in Barnes. His other daughter, Penny, died of heart disease two years ago at 43, after a prolonged illness. It is a measure of how private a man Waterhouse is that even when he told close friends about it, they didn't feel able to ask him about what had happened. </p> <p>Friends reinforce his aversion to the personal. \"The worst thing you can do to Keith,\" says one, \"is to either tell him a joke - he doesn't mind listening to an anecdote, but a look of fear and pain comes over him when someone starts to tell a joke - or tell him you have a personal problem that you'd like to talk about.\" Jaci Stephen, the journalist, has been a friend of Waterhouse since she gave one of his many sitcoms a terrible review about 10 years ago. She says that while, \"he absolutely understands how people work, you never talk about things like that with him. He's terrific company but he's an extremely private person who is much happier talking about people in the business and what's going on in Fleet Street.\" </p> <p>Waterhouse married for a second time in 1984, to the journalist Stella Bingham. They divorced in 1989, but still see each other regularly. \"Marriage didn't suit either of us,\" he explains. \"We got on well enough before, and we get on well now.\" In 1994, his former secretary and mistress, Jean Leyland, referred to in his columns as his \"flame-haired factotum\", threatened to take him to an industrial tribunal for unfair dismissal. Leyland gave an interview in which she claimed, \"at 1pm he would expect smoked salmon sandwiches and a bottle of champagne, and I had to put on my black basque, suspenders and stripogram gear\". The case was settled out of court, and when asked about it he just waves his hand and mutters, \"an interlude time. I've forgotten about that.\" </p> <p>Although he was a star of Cudlipp's Mirror, and said he enjoyed work as a news and features reporter, he also wanted to do, \"something less ephemeral. I wanted to expand.\" He always thought he had lived between two stools as far as writing was concerned. \"Down in Nottingham there was DH Lawrence writing out of muck heaps and pits, and in London there was PG Wodehouse and the Drones club. But I was stuck in a council estate in Leeds: who would want to read about that? Then I read Dylan Thomas's stories about his adolescence, Portrait of an Artist as a Young Dog, which was a real eye-opener. It came as a blaze that you could write about anything, and it was up to you to bring the society you were writing about alive.\" </p> <p> A newspaper strike in 1956 gave him the time, and he wrote his first novel, There Is a Happy Land, which was set on a Leeds housing estate. Four years later he left the Mirror staff but was given \u00a31,000 a year by Hugh Cudlipp not to write for any other paper. He maintained contact with the paper as a freelance and started his twice-weekly column there in 1970. He eventually left after the paper was bought by Robert Maxwell. \"I am rather in favour of larger than life newspaper bosses,\" he says, \"but he was a bit too large.\" Former Mirror editor, Mike Molloy, says Waterhouse's presence in its pages gave the paper a lift. \"He mostly worked at home, but when he did come in to the office it was good for the paper because people were genuinely proud to have someone of his stature knocking around.\" </p> <p>Waterhouse's first act after leaving the staff was to write Billy Liar, the story of the daydreaming Billy Fisher planning his escape from his job in the Leeds undertakers. He left 10,000 words of it in a taxi and had to start again. \"The best thing that happened to me; it was pretentious twaddle.\" He says it was a life changing event, but by then it wasn't really rags to riches. \"It was more suede shoes to Gucci shoes, not that I ever wore Gucci shoes, but I could if I wanted to.\" </p> <p>The phrase Billy Liar has entered the culture, and he has in his study framed front pages of it as headlines. Two recent examples are from the New York Post about Bill Clinton in relation to Monica Lewinsky, and in the Sun about William Hague's claims to have drunk 14 pints of beers a day. The novel has never been out of print, the stage version was chosen as one of the 100 best plays of the last century by the National Theatre, and the classic 1963 film starring Tom Courtney and Julie Christie was recently revived to critical acclaim in New York. </p> <p>Of his other fiction, he says his favourite is the 1981 novel, Maggie Muggins, a first person account of the life of a young alcoholic woman living in Earl's Court, which received widespread acclaim. His 14th and latest novel, Soho, is published next week. It tells the contemporary story of a young Leeds boy searching for his girlfriend. Waterhouse says he's always had a fixation on the place. \"It is a conurbation of truants, which is what I like about it. Jeffrey Bernard was the Huckleberry Finn of Soho. The rest of us were going home and paying mortgages and educating children, but Jeff was paddling his raft up and down Old Compton Street.\" </p> <p>The novel is, of course, funny and picaresque, with some wonderful lines and observations. It also has a slightly melancholy air, with several deaths of characters as well as the death of the old Soho. \"But part of Soho is always dying as another part is renewing itself,\" he explains. </p> <p>It was Willis Hall, who first wrote with Waterhouse on a youth club magazine when they were both 14, who encouraged Waterhouse's move in to the theatre, suggesting that Billy Liar would make a good play. \"And this was the 60s,\" recalls Waterhouse, \"when you couldn't move on the slag heaps of the north for film and television crews. We were caught up in all that.\" </p> <p>The pair scripted two more key British films, Whistle Down the Wind and A Kind of Loving, and in Hollywood they worked, un-credited, on Hitchcock's Torn Curtain. Back in London they took an office in Bond Street above Vidal Sassoon's salon. Willis Hall describes their routine. \"We'd start work at about nine in the morning and work until lunchtime. Then we seemed to go off and piss it up for God knows how many hours, but we'd always be back in the office at nine.\" </p> <p>As well as films they also worked in television. Starting with sketches for the likes of TW3 and the Frost Report, they went on to write scripts for a huge variety of programmes, including Budgie, Queenie's Castle and Worzel Gummidge. Who now remembers The Upchat Line, in which John Alderton played a freeloading newspaper hack who lived out of a locker in Marylebone station? </p> <p>But it was the theatre and theatrical life that was Waterhouse's greatest love. As a boy in Leeds, he would take girls to the cinema but not to the theatre, even though it was cheaper, because he would prefer to watch the play. Ned Sher rin feels it might be the instant family of the theatre that attracts him. \"There is a wonderful ephemeral family feeling of being in rehearsal and then playing out of town for a couple of weeks. Keith is a very gregarious person and I think he loves to have a lot of close mates, who he doesn't have any responsibility for, around him.\" </p> <p>Perhaps the greatest critical acclaim he has received in the theatre was for his and Willis Hall's National Theatre adaptation of the Italian dramatist de Filippo's Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and Filumena, which won the 1978 Olivier award for best comedy. Ned Sherrin says the recent translation of de Filippo's work, put on by Peter Hall, \"didn't compare to the one Keith and Willis did\". In 1986, Sherrin directed Waterhouse's Mr and Mrs Pooter, starring Judi Dench and Michael Williams, and went on to direct another four Waterhouse plays, including his hugely successful 1989 adaptation of Jeffrey Bernard's Spectator columns, Jeffrey Bernard is Unwell. Waterhouse says that he expected the play to last for the few weeks that Peter O'Toole was able to star in it. But Sherrin says: \"I think Keith always felt it would work. It is a universal poem about self-destruction, old friends, nostalgia and all this sort of thing. It read like Shaw with a heart, and I knew it was very good.\" The play has been performed all over the world, and is on in Paris at the moment. </p> <p>Waterhouse's next play was Bookends in 1990, which was adapted from Craig Brown's book, The Marsh-Marlowe Letters. It was a difficult process, with Brown asking for a couple of Waterhouse jokes to be taken out and turning up on the opening night to find that they were still there. \"The book was a kind of satire on two crusty old men,\" explains Brown, \"but somehow on stage the crusty old men were kind of being applauded. I think he was over sympathetic to these characters that I was sending up.\" </p> <p>A similar complaint is made about Waterhouse's treatment of Jeffrey Bernard. Brown says: \"I thought Bernard was a pretty unpleasant man. I didn't find his alcoholism and misogyny amusing, but somehow, for people who liked the play, he was made to seem a bit cuddly. I think if Waterhouse has a failing, it's that sort of slight misanthropy.\" </p> <p>However, a propensity to the crusty and the reactionary is something of an occupational hazard for a popular newspaper columnist. But that said, Waterhouse has never been an entirely predictable creature of the Mail's world view. Although he recently supported the grocer charged after insisting on selling his bananas in pounds, not kilos, and is an enthusiastic Brussels basher, there are still traces of the Red Flag-singing radical of his youth, and in his recent column on the Wessex debacle, a few bottles were thrown at the house of Windsor in general. </p> <p>It is widely assumed that because he is so productive, Waterhouse can churn out copy on demand. Even his former editor, Mike Molloy, who had never actually seen him write, thought so until they were once in a New York hotel. \"We were due to meet for dinner so I knocked on his door and there was a voice as if from 10 fathoms deep saying 'come in'. I went in and his column was lying on the bed looking like a map of the Ypres Salient. It was covered with all these lines and crosses and stabs marks from his fountain pen. 'It's coming a bit slowly,' he grunted, and we agreed to meet a bit later. After an hour or so, Keith turned up at the restaurant whistling, and had I not seen him earlier, I'd never have known what he had gone through.\" </p> <p>Whatever the pains of the process, Waterhouse continues to do what he has always done and has another novel and a new play in progress. Despite a persistent wheezy cough, which he has had since he gave up smoking 30 years ago, he says he is in good health and has never missed a day's work. He doesn't intend to start now. While he says he does look back fondly on the old Fleet Street, in what he calls its anecdotage, to his credit he doesn't overdo the reminiscences about the good old days of hot metal and drinking in El Vino's. </p> <p>\"The only time anyone is in El Vino's now is after a memorial service, with people bellowing 'it's what he would have wanted'.\" Waterhouse genuinely prefers to look to the future where, for him, there is always the next book, play or column. \"I'll always have something else to do. If I write everything that's in my head, I've got five years' work and during the course of that five years other things will crop up and I'll die and that will be about it. I suppose I must actually like sitting here in this room, with some silly detective play on the radio, banging away on that machine.\" <strong>Life at a glance:</strong> Keith Spencer Waterhouse</p> <p><strong> Born: </strong> 6 February 1929, Leeds </p> <p><strong> Family:</strong> Married Joan Foster 1950, divorced, one son, two daughters; married Stella Bingham 1984, divorced. </p> <p><strong> Career:</strong> journalist 1950-present; columnist with Daily Mirror 70-86; Daily Mail 86-present. </p> <p><strong> Some films</strong> <strong> with Willis Hall:</strong> Billy Liar 60; Whistle Down the Wind 61; A Kind of Loving 62 </p> <p><strong> Some plays with Willis Hall:</strong> Billy Liar 60; Celebration 61; The Card (musical) 73 </p> <p><strong> Some solo plays:</strong> Mr and Mrs Nobody 86; Jeffrey Bernard is Unwell 89; Bookends 90 </p> <p><strong> Some TV series:</strong> Budgie 71-72; Billy Liar 73; Andy Capp 88 </p> <p><strong> Some books: </strong> There is a Happy Land 57; Billy Liar 59; Jubb 63; Maggie Muggins 81; Our Song 88; Bimbo 1990; Daily Mirror Style 80; Mrs Pooter's Diary 83; City Lights (memoir) 94 </p> <p><strong> Awards:</strong> CBE 1991 </p> <p> \u0095 Soho is published by Sceptre, price \u00a316.99</p>",

      "bodyText": "It was 50 years ago that Keith Waterhouse first set foot in Fleet Street. He had travelled from his home in Leeds to be interviewed for a job as a reporter on the now defunct News Chronicle. It simply hadn't occurred to the 21-year-old that he might be rejected, but he realised something had gone wrong when the interview ended and he was told not to forget to send an invoice for his travel expenses. Before beginning the long journey back home, he walked down to Ludgate Circus to pay his respects at the plaque there commemorating Edgar Wallace, his hero. Wallace had sold newspapers on that spot as a boy before going on to be a journalist, Boer war correspondent, novelist, playwright and Hollywood script writer. This was the future the dejected Waterhouse thought he had just been excluded from. However, as he noted in his memoirs, in reality it was all just around the corner. \"How was I to know then that within months I should be established on Fleet Street,\" he wrote, \"that within three years I should be more familiar with New York, Washington, Moscow and Leningrad than I now was with London, that within four I should be turning down the post of the New Chronicle's chief reporter, that within five I should be publishing my first novel, and within 10 I should see my name in lights on Shaftesbury Avenue and on the cinema posters of Leicester Square?\" That catalogue of achievement takes him up to 1961, and since then there has been a great deal more of the same. He says the only thing Wallace did that he hasn't, is to own racehorses. Late last year Waterhouse was given a What the Papers Say lifetime achievement award. \"A bit unnerving,\" he recalls, before asking: \"Where to from there?\" But this is a rhetorical question. He has no intention of going anywhere. As far back as 1994, just before his 65th birthday, one observer noted that he had already passed through the stages of being a survivor, an anachronism, a dinosaur and a monument. Whatever his status, he just keeps chugging on and the novels, plays and journalism continue to pile up. His twice-weekly column in the Daily Mail, with its occasional cast of Dickensian-named bureaucrats, politicians, illiterates and the rest, is not to everyone's taste. Julie Burchill recently launched into him. \"There are many irritating things about the Daily Mail, but surely a contender for most irritating item is Keith Waterhouse's recurrent Sharon and Tracy column, in which two monumentally thick working-class shopgirls demonstrate that they have the IQ of a sock. From time to time, highly qualified young Sharons and Tracys write in to the paper and request that Waterhouse desists. But the tired old routine drags on and on. Can we imagine Waterhouse being allowed regularly to spoof two stupid, idle West Indians or Irishmen in his column, even in the Daily Mail? Of course not.\" Another attack came after he called William Hague a wimp for consulting Ffion. But none of this has stopped Waterhouse's lucid combination of fierce topicality and an encyclopaedic memory ensuring that he is still one of the best-read and best-paid columnists around. A good example was provided earlier this week when the travails of Sophie Wessex and Marks &amp; Spencer were thrown into the pot, along with flashbacks of 30s Leeds. Leading humorist and columnist Craig Brown shares many reservations about Waterhouse's approach, but notes that while, \"the Mail can swamp even the best writer because its own voice is so strong, nevertheless, at least once a month, Waterhouse does have an original idea which is more than most columnists can manage. I think the main thing is that he is quite a hero really. No one else has done a humorous column for such a long time, and so skilfully and with such an ease of style.\" Waterhouse's work in other mediums is similarly respected. As a novelist from the late 50s, his fiction, of which Billy Liar is still the best known, was seen as part of the revolt of the angry young men. He has now written 14 novels and academic and critic Richard Hoggart says: \"I very much admire his work. He's very talented and witty, quirky and outspoken.\" Ned Sherrin has directed five of Waterhouse's 20 plays, including the hugely successful Jeffrey Bernard is Unwell. He says that, \"there'll always be a place in the theatre for Billy Liar, and Celebration [his 1961 play written, like Billy Liar, with Willis Hall] will always be worth reviving. He has an instinctive stage craft. God knows where he picked it up.\" The best guess is somewhere in a working-class Leeds childhood that, Waterhouse perceptively notes, although packed with escapism, was in fact an escape into realism. He was transfixed by the nitty gritty of Leeds life, and his recollection of his adventures around the city invest the place with the same lyrical nostalgia that Woody Allen does to his childhood New York. Fellow Leeds boy Gerald Kaufman said Waterhouse's 1994 memoir, City Lights, gave back to him, \"the Leeds that I loved, the Leeds that time and change had taken away\". (Waterhouse had already complimented Kaufman with the sublimely backhanded observation that his book, My Life in the Silver Screen, was, \"the best volume of film-going memoirs ever written by a politician\".) Waterhouse was born in 1929 in a back-to-back house in the Hunslet area of the city. He was the youngest of four boys and a girl. His father, Ernest, was a heavy-drinking costermonger who sold vegetables from a cart in South Leeds and died when Waterhouse was aged three. His total estate was a brown suit and a ha'penny left in the pocket, which was given to the young Keith. These were the hungry 30s and the family was visited by bailiffs who took all the furniture except the mattresses and a stool for his mother, Elsie, to sit on. \"But we were richer than the poorest because my mother had a thing about shoes,\" he recalls. \"She thought shoes were respectable and boots were not - and clogs positively not. She got the shoes from the public benefit shoe company, so we were a shoe-wearing family, which was quite important.\" He says his mother was ambitious for her children, \"within her knowledge and limitations\". She once bought a book in French for his sister - \"I suppose she thought she would assimilate this language somehow\" - and when she found Keith wanted to write, she bought him notebooks. \"But with the greatest respect to my mother,\" he says, \"she had no idea who I was or what I was about. I was a bit of a cuckoo in the nest, and she was like the mother bird bringing worms home and not really knowing if cuckoos ate worms. She knew I was different, and she encouraged this difference without quite knowing what it was. For instance, she got me into school a year early, aged four, because I wouldn't stop reading.\" Despite this early academic promise, Waterhouse failed the 11- plus but, perversely, this put him in some pretty good company. The Leeds-born critic Richard Hoggart had failed the same exam, and so did Waterhouse's eventual writing partner, Willis Hall. However, at 13, Waterhouse won a scholarship to the local college of commerce where he came under the influence of a science teacher who had to teach English because of the wartime shortage of teachers. \"He would just chuck a book like Huckleberry Finn at me and say 'you might like this'.\" Although Waterhouse's mother had expected him to leave school at 14 to bring some money into the house, she allowed him to stay an extra 18 months. \"She wanted me 'to get on', as the phrase was,\" he says, but he was already contributing financially at home. \"I had at least five paper rounds, I sold firewood and I had a window-cleaning round, ground floor only because I didn't have a ladder. As a schoolboy, I was in fact earning at my height more than I earned in my first job.\" When he left school, he became a clerk in an undertakers-cum-surveyors, auctioneers and estate agents, who also hired out limousines. Years later it provided the setting for Billy Liar, but at this stage he says he was writing \"sub Wodehouse stories set in Mayfair. The idea of using a Leeds undertakers' parlour didn't cross my mind.\" Waterhouse's career as a writer was sealed when at 15 he sent a humorous piece about a conversation in a music shop to Punch. The editor wrote back saying \"not quite\" - \"which was as good as an acceptance from any other magazine\". So Waterhouse pressed his only copy of the typed manuscript under a damp towel with a flat iron, as he had been taught by the Writer magazine, and sent it off to a magazine called London Opinion. They paid him two guineas for it. His career as a journalist was put on hold when was called up for National Service in the RAF, but as soon as he was demobbed he fulfilled his ambition to be a reporter on the Yorkshire Evening Post. He says, looking back, his ambition was \"crazily optimistic\", but when he told his mother, \"she just accepted that I would be and I believed it totally as well. It was more arrogance than confidence, but I was the driven one of the family, although at the time I didn't know I was driving.\" A colleague on the paper was Barbara Taylor, now better known as the bestselling novelist Barbara Taylor Bradford. She remembers Waterhouse with, \"flaming red unruly hair rising up from his head\", kicking against the paper's owners, the Leeds Conservative Newspaper Company, by going round the corridors singing the Red Flag. He helped her with her copy and taught her how to manufacture an expense account. \"He'd say, 'Barbara, you're going to shame us with your two-and-six expenses and we've all put in for five quid',\" she recalls. \"He also used to borrow 10 shillings off me - which he always paid back - and take me to lunch in the Kardomah, where he'd regale me about how he was going to go to Fleet Street and going to write plays.\" In a neat illustration of how far they have both since travelled, the last time Waterhouse and Taylor met was at the Dorchester where they were chatting to the then prime minister, John Major. While all of his career ambitions were fulfilled long ago, Waterhouse still continues the routine he's had for the past 40 years: churning out the pages on an ancient Adler portable typewriter from the cluttered study he calls \"the word factory\" in his Earl's Court mansion flat home. He is not exactly taciturn, but there is a stillness and quietness, although friends insist that he is not in the least melancholy or lonely. He invariably answers questions in a single, neat sentence and says that writing is not something he likes doing, it is something he likes having done. \"It's what I do, it's what I am for. Whether I like it or not doesn't really come into it.\" Ned Sherrin says Waterhouse, \"gets up when the cock crows and does his work and so he is free for lunch. He doesn't eat a great deal but it is very celebratory. There's always that salad left untouched which he reckons he imbibes by osmosis.\" He likes to have a drink on the go most of the afternoon and evening, but says he never gets a hangover, nor missed a morning's work because of it. His first Fleet Street job was on the Daily Mirror in 1951. He joined within a few weeks of the legendary editor, Hugh Cudlipp, who \"kind of adopted me\", says Waterhouse. \"I learned a hell of a lot from him. It was a bit in the manner of my old English teacher throwing Huckleberry Finn at me, but he would throw assignments. He'd say 'go to the south of France and write about having a good time'. He was a great believer in bread and circuses. He would do the heavy politics and then say, 'that's enough of politics, let's have some fun in the paper', and I was involved in both sides.\" As a newsman, Waterhouse was a correspondent in America, Russia and Cyprus. With the close links between the Labour party high command and the Mirror, Waterhouse found himself drafting articles and speeches for Hugh Gaitskill and Harold Wilson. \"I never belonged to the Labour Party but I did dabble,\" he says. \"But I really go with my friend Richard Littlejohn on this. He says it's the task of the columnist to sit at the back throwing bottles, and I rather believe that.\" This approach seems calculated to bait a certain sort of politician. When Harriet Harman, as secretary of state for social security, was promoting after-school clubs for children, the example she gave of opposition to her ideas was a Waterhouse column. His view was that children should be, \"falling into ponds, eating poisonous berries, contracting stomach-ache from under-ripe stolen apples, getting lost, being bitten by dogs, fighting and starting fires, sitting in cowpats and acquiring bumps the size of a duck-egg on their heads\". Despite this flippancy, he has contributed to government education policy as a member of the Kingman Committee on teaching English in the mid 80s. Friends say that, while he can deliver the occasional stunning one-liners, he is more prone to a sort of surreal schoolboy humour. There are lots of stories of him behaving badly at party conferences. At one Blackpool Labour conference in the mid 70s, via a series of complicated bets, he won the trousers of a fellow reporter and then went round the bars introducing the trousers to various members of the Callaghan cabinet. Once in Venice he bought the entire stock of clockwork soldiers from a stall and marched them into the Grand Canal because he had seen a similar thing in a New Yorker cartoon. The distinguished former industrial editor of the Mirror, Geoffrey Goodman, says that while Waterhouse was often great fun to be with, he wasn't a regular in the Mirror pub, known as the Stab in the Back. \"He sought out his own territory and was much more inclined to hang around theatreland. He's only really at home with journalists if they are his mates.\" Wherever he hung around, it was for long enough to precipitate the end of his first marriage. He had met Joan Foster in Leeds when they were both 16, and they married at 21. Almost the first thing they did was move to London for the Mirror job and their three children were all born there. He says the marriage was not untypical of Fleet Street marriages of the time in that he didn't see his family for days on end. When the marriage finished in the mid 60s, he actually began to see more of his children with regular weekend and midweek dates, which continued well after they became adults. His son, Bob, is now the artistic director of a theatre in Buffalo, New York, and has staged a successful production of Jeffrey Bernard is Unwell. His daughter Sarah runs a picture-framing business in Barnes. His other daughter, Penny, died of heart disease two years ago at 43, after a prolonged illness. It is a measure of how private a man Waterhouse is that even when he told close friends about it, they didn't feel able to ask him about what had happened. Friends reinforce his aversion to the personal. \"The worst thing you can do to Keith,\" says one, \"is to either tell him a joke - he doesn't mind listening to an anecdote, but a look of fear and pain comes over him when someone starts to tell a joke - or tell him you have a personal problem that you'd like to talk about.\" Jaci Stephen, the journalist, has been a friend of Waterhouse since she gave one of his many sitcoms a terrible review about 10 years ago. She says that while, \"he absolutely understands how people work, you never talk about things like that with him. He's terrific company but he's an extremely private person who is much happier talking about people in the business and what's going on in Fleet Street.\" Waterhouse married for a second time in 1984, to the journalist Stella Bingham. They divorced in 1989, but still see each other regularly. \"Marriage didn't suit either of us,\" he explains. \"We got on well enough before, and we get on well now.\" In 1994, his former secretary and mistress, Jean Leyland, referred to in his columns as his \"flame-haired factotum\", threatened to take him to an industrial tribunal for unfair dismissal. Leyland gave an interview in which she claimed, \"at 1pm he would expect smoked salmon sandwiches and a bottle of champagne, and I had to put on my black basque, suspenders and stripogram gear\". The case was settled out of court, and when asked about it he just waves his hand and mutters, \"an interlude time. I've forgotten about that.\" Although he was a star of Cudlipp's Mirror, and said he enjoyed work as a news and features reporter, he also wanted to do, \"something less ephemeral. I wanted to expand.\" He always thought he had lived between two stools as far as writing was concerned. \"Down in Nottingham there was DH Lawrence writing out of muck heaps and pits, and in London there was PG Wodehouse and the Drones club. But I was stuck in a council estate in Leeds: who would want to read about that? Then I read Dylan Thomas's stories about his adolescence, Portrait of an Artist as a Young Dog, which was a real eye-opener. It came as a blaze that you could write about anything, and it was up to you to bring the society you were writing about alive.\" A newspaper strike in 1956 gave him the time, and he wrote his first novel, There Is a Happy Land, which was set on a Leeds housing estate. Four years later he left the Mirror staff but was given \u00a31,000 a year by Hugh Cudlipp not to write for any other paper. He maintained contact with the paper as a freelance and started his twice-weekly column there in 1970. He eventually left after the paper was bought by Robert Maxwell. \"I am rather in favour of larger than life newspaper bosses,\" he says, \"but he was a bit too large.\" Former Mirror editor, Mike Molloy, says Waterhouse's presence in its pages gave the paper a lift. \"He mostly worked at home, but when he did come in to the office it was good for the paper because people were genuinely proud to have someone of his stature knocking around.\" Waterhouse's first act after leaving the staff was to write Billy Liar, the story of the daydreaming Billy Fisher planning his escape from his job in the Leeds undertakers. He left 10,000 words of it in a taxi and had to start again. \"The best thing that happened to me; it was pretentious twaddle.\" He says it was a life changing event, but by then it wasn't really rags to riches. \"It was more suede shoes to Gucci shoes, not that I ever wore Gucci shoes, but I could if I wanted to.\" The phrase Billy Liar has entered the culture, and he has in his study framed front pages of it as headlines. Two recent examples are from the New York Post about Bill Clinton in relation to Monica Lewinsky, and in the Sun about William Hague's claims to have drunk 14 pints of beers a day. The novel has never been out of print, the stage version was chosen as one of the 100 best plays of the last century by the National Theatre, and the classic 1963 film starring Tom Courtney and Julie Christie was recently revived to critical acclaim in New York. Of his other fiction, he says his favourite is the 1981 novel, Maggie Muggins, a first person account of the life of a young alcoholic woman living in Earl's Court, which received widespread acclaim. His 14th and latest novel, Soho, is published next week. It tells the contemporary story of a young Leeds boy searching for his girlfriend. Waterhouse says he's always had a fixation on the place. \"It is a conurbation of truants, which is what I like about it. Jeffrey Bernard was the Huckleberry Finn of Soho. The rest of us were going home and paying mortgages and educating children, but Jeff was paddling his raft up and down Old Compton Street.\" The novel is, of course, funny and picaresque, with some wonderful lines and observations. It also has a slightly melancholy air, with several deaths of characters as well as the death of the old Soho. \"But part of Soho is always dying as another part is renewing itself,\" he explains. It was Willis Hall, who first wrote with Waterhouse on a youth club magazine when they were both 14, who encouraged Waterhouse's move in to the theatre, suggesting that Billy Liar would make a good play. \"And this was the 60s,\" recalls Waterhouse, \"when you couldn't move on the slag heaps of the north for film and television crews. We were caught up in all that.\" The pair scripted two more key British films, Whistle Down the Wind and A Kind of Loving, and in Hollywood they worked, un-credited, on Hitchcock's Torn Curtain. Back in London they took an office in Bond Street above Vidal Sassoon's salon. Willis Hall describes their routine. \"We'd start work at about nine in the morning and work until lunchtime. Then we seemed to go off and piss it up for God knows how many hours, but we'd always be back in the office at nine.\" As well as films they also worked in television. Starting with sketches for the likes of TW3 and the Frost Report, they went on to write scripts for a huge variety of programmes, including Budgie, Queenie's Castle and Worzel Gummidge. Who now remembers The Upchat Line, in which John Alderton played a freeloading newspaper hack who lived out of a locker in Marylebone station? But it was the theatre and theatrical life that was Waterhouse's greatest love. As a boy in Leeds, he would take girls to the cinema but not to the theatre, even though it was cheaper, because he would prefer to watch the play. Ned Sher rin feels it might be the instant family of the theatre that attracts him. \"There is a wonderful ephemeral family feeling of being in rehearsal and then playing out of town for a couple of weeks. Keith is a very gregarious person and I think he loves to have a lot of close mates, who he doesn't have any responsibility for, around him.\" Perhaps the greatest critical acclaim he has received in the theatre was for his and Willis Hall's National Theatre adaptation of the Italian dramatist de Filippo's Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and Filumena, which won the 1978 Olivier award for best comedy. Ned Sherrin says the recent translation of de Filippo's work, put on by Peter Hall, \"didn't compare to the one Keith and Willis did\". In 1986, Sherrin directed Waterhouse's Mr and Mrs Pooter, starring Judi Dench and Michael Williams, and went on to direct another four Waterhouse plays, including his hugely successful 1989 adaptation of Jeffrey Bernard's Spectator columns, Jeffrey Bernard is Unwell. Waterhouse says that he expected the play to last for the few weeks that Peter O'Toole was able to star in it. But Sherrin says: \"I think Keith always felt it would work. It is a universal poem about self-destruction, old friends, nostalgia and all this sort of thing. It read like Shaw with a heart, and I knew it was very good.\" The play has been performed all over the world, and is on in Paris at the moment. Waterhouse's next play was Bookends in 1990, which was adapted from Craig Brown's book, The Marsh-Marlowe Letters. It was a difficult process, with Brown asking for a couple of Waterhouse jokes to be taken out and turning up on the opening night to find that they were still there. \"The book was a kind of satire on two crusty old men,\" explains Brown, \"but somehow on stage the crusty old men were kind of being applauded. I think he was over sympathetic to these characters that I was sending up.\" A similar complaint is made about Waterhouse's treatment of Jeffrey Bernard. Brown says: \"I thought Bernard was a pretty unpleasant man. I didn't find his alcoholism and misogyny amusing, but somehow, for people who liked the play, he was made to seem a bit cuddly. I think if Waterhouse has a failing, it's that sort of slight misanthropy.\" However, a propensity to the crusty and the reactionary is something of an occupational hazard for a popular newspaper columnist. But that said, Waterhouse has never been an entirely predictable creature of the Mail's world view. Although he recently supported the grocer charged after insisting on selling his bananas in pounds, not kilos, and is an enthusiastic Brussels basher, there are still traces of the Red Flag-singing radical of his youth, and in his recent column on the Wessex debacle, a few bottles were thrown at the house of Windsor in general. It is widely assumed that because he is so productive, Waterhouse can churn out copy on demand. Even his former editor, Mike Molloy, who had never actually seen him write, thought so until they were once in a New York hotel. \"We were due to meet for dinner so I knocked on his door and there was a voice as if from 10 fathoms deep saying 'come in'. I went in and his column was lying on the bed looking like a map of the Ypres Salient. It was covered with all these lines and crosses and stabs marks from his fountain pen. 'It's coming a bit slowly,' he grunted, and we agreed to meet a bit later. After an hour or so, Keith turned up at the restaurant whistling, and had I not seen him earlier, I'd never have known what he had gone through.\" Whatever the pains of the process, Waterhouse continues to do what he has always done and has another novel and a new play in progress. Despite a persistent wheezy cough, which he has had since he gave up smoking 30 years ago, he says he is in good health and has never missed a day's work. He doesn't intend to start now. While he says he does look back fondly on the old Fleet Street, in what he calls its anecdotage, to his credit he doesn't overdo the reminiscences about the good old days of hot metal and drinking in El Vino's. \"The only time anyone is in El Vino's now is after a memorial service, with people bellowing 'it's what he would have wanted'.\" Waterhouse genuinely prefers to look to the future where, for him, there is always the next book, play or column. \"I'll always have something else to do. If I write everything that's in my head, I've got five years' work and during the course of that five years other things will crop up and I'll die and that will be about it. I suppose I must actually like sitting here in this room, with some silly detective play on the radio, banging away on that machine.\" Life at a glance: Keith Spencer Waterhouse Born: 6 February 1929, Leeds Family: Married Joan Foster 1950, divorced, one son, two daughters; married Stella Bingham 1984, divorced.

Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt, seduced not one but two of history's most famous politicians, first living with and having a son by Julius Caesar; then, after Caesar's death, having an even more public affair with Mark Antony. Antony and Cleopatra were eventually defeated and driven to suicide by Caesar's great-nephew, Octavian; but even though he went on to transform the Roman Empire, no artist or writer was ever inspired by his story as they were by Cleopatra and her Antony. </p> <p>The British Museum's exhibition Cleopatra of Egypt: From History to Myth takes this magical story and pulverises it. It makes Cleo-patra, who has seemed like our contemporary from the time of Shakespeare's England to Liz Taylor's Hollywood, a figure as remote as Shelley's Ozymandias. It achieves this despite containing works of art that, under normal circumstances, would take your breath away. There are Roman paintings from Pompeii lent by the Naples Archaeological Museum, a statue of Cleopatra from the Hermitage, and even the colossal head thought to be of Caesarion, Cleopatra's son by Caesar - recently raised from Alexandria harbour by French archaeologists, and a star find from the most dramatic development in Egyptian archaeology in decades. \"Wonderful things,\" as Howard Carter said when he first peeped into the tomb of Tutankhamen - yet even the most wonderful things can be sterilised by a badly conceived exhibition. </p> <p>The degree to which this show makes a sow's ear out of one of history's finest silk purses is spectacular. You walk up the spiral staircase to the Joseph Hotung Gallery with anticipation, the Egyptian statuary displayed on the way up looking gorgeous in the light and space of Norman Foster's Great Court. You've read the press coverage about the British Museum finally revealing the real face of Cleopatra. This is going to be a sensation. Then there's a surreal change of scale from the generous expanse of the Great Court to this pocket-sized gallery, which would be perfect for prints or gems, but is obviously too small for a show of this scope. Inside, the treasures of Egypt and Rome have been squashed together in what are supposed to be separate sec tions exploring aspects of Cleopatra's life and legend, but their close proximity and the utterly confusing plan make it a headache just working out which bit you're in. Within minutes, excitement gives way to bafflement, followed by boredom. Is this a bust of Julius Caesar, or Mark Antony? Who's on that coin? Where's the shop? </p> <p>This is an oppressive and cynical exercise, an unholy alliance of marketing and scholarship. The marketing department's contribution is felt not just in the spurious advance publicity - you no more see the true face of Cleopatra in her variously idealised statues and coins than you see the real Christ on the telly - but in the patronising layout of the show. There are big picture boards everywhere, as if this were a corporate presentation. Above is a frieze of images of Cleopatra from the movies. It's all so desperate, I wouldn't have been surprised if, on the way out, there was an animatronic statue of Kenneth Williams in his toga saying \"Infamy, Infamy, they've all got it in for me.\" It's like the same museum's Gladiators and Caesars exhibition last year, which lamely gestured towards the movie Gladiator without reflecting any of the true love of ancient Rome visible in Ridley Scott's film. </p> <p>But what kills this exhibition stone dead is its lack of any coherent point. The fact that it fails to tell the story of Antony and Cleopatra in a lucid, informative manner is bad enough. But what it does instead is bewildering. The argument seems to be, broadly, that there was a real Cleopatra, and there is a mythic one. This exhibition juxtaposes the two, setting the queen in her time and place, and also following her reinvention in art from Rome through Renaissance and the Baroque up to Cecil B DeMille's 1934 film Cleopatra. This sounds fine, but it is misconceived. The attempt to bring us close to the \"real\" Cleo-patra turns out to be doomed: the more artefacts you look at, the further away you get. There are also few contemporary representations of Cleopatra - and some of those are questionable. </p> <p>What you get instead are approaches to and flirtations with facts, the promised revelation endlessly deferred. So there's a section that brings together artefacts from Cleopatra's capital, Alexandria, several of them recently discovered. There's a lovely mosaic of a dog excavated in 1993 on the site of the new Alexandrian library - a witty, crisp work of art, but nothing to do with Cleopatra; indeed, it dates from a century before her time. Context is great, yes, but how do we get from the dog to the queen? The collection of drinking vessels from Alexandria won't do it. Perhaps that bust is Cleopatra? Oh no, it's just a noblewoman. And that guy who looks like Caesar? He's not Caesar. Nothing in the ancient art seems to get us close to the \"real\" people in the story - and why would we expect it to ? </p> <p>It's the Roman images of Egypt, full of nutty stereotype and fantasy, that kick a little life into the proceedings: a painted plaster panel from Pompeii purportedly depicting life on the Nile has pygmies riding crocodiles and fighting hippos in a graphic manifestation of the west's image of Egypt as the strangest place on earth. It was this sense of Egypt as exotic that gave the story of Cleopatra such resonance. Then we're on to the image of Cleopatra in later art, and this is where you get the juicy iconography whose absence in antiquity is proved here in such tedious detail. At last, Cleopatra lifts the asp to her bare breast in Guercino's sultry Baroque drawing in red chalk, done in the 1630s. These images are fascinating, but again there's a patchiness that stops you getting absorbed: to cover such a great theme in art history in 10 or so drawings, paintings and porcelain statuettes is pathetic. </p> <p>The British Museum has a problem with exhibitions.

But a national museum has a duty to create and cultivate an intelligent public. The amount of marketing flannel surrounding this show - from \"a beautiful gift book, Cleopatra's Face\" to a talk by Tracey Emin, who recently visited Cairo - suggests the British Museum has a poor opinion of our ability to engage with the art of the past.

      "body": "<p>Cast and crew showings of films produce an atmosphere that can be seductive. The air is charged with affection and goodwill which are not conducive to objectivity. This week I was invited to Captain Corelli's Mandolin at the Empire, Leicester Square with a full house of the partisan. I hadn't liked the book, so my expectations were modest. It is a fine film - moving, wonderfully acted, and superbly directed by John Madden. </p> <p>I reflected on the question of books and films. It is a cliche that it is difficult to make a good film out of a good book. The reason for this is said to be that a good book gives the individual imagination an outing, where the bad book merely rearranges the familiar. </p> <p>But I think there is more to it. The experience of watching a movie has been described as the experience of watching two giant faces which will eventually come together.

This week I was invited to Captain Corelli's Mandolin at the Empire, Leicester Square with a full house of the partisan. I hadn't liked the book, so my expectations were modest. It is a fine film - moving, wonderfully acted, and superbly directed by John Madden. I reflected on the question of books and films. It is a cliche that it is difficult to make a good film out of a good book. The reason for this is said to be that a good book gives the individual imagination an outing, where the bad book merely rearranges the familiar. But I think there is more to it. The experience of watching a movie has been described as the experience of watching two giant faces which will eventually come together. These faces bring to the film something that was never - for better or for worse - in the book. Penelope Cruz in Corelli is mesmerising, and Madden has the confidence to allow her and Nicolas Cage to remain silent at key moments. You see here the power of the mute human face, in all its intimacy and vulnerability, a fact that great painters have known for a thousand years.

The poll, for the Catholic weekly magazine The Tablet, shows that although there is still a strong vestigial belief in Christianity, the established churches are neither attracting nor benefiting from it. More worrying for the churches' future is the level of religious belief among the young. While 80% of those aged over 65 still believe that Jesus lived, only 54% of those aged 18-24 do so. Politicians entering the general election promising a greater role for church schools and religious charities in welfare provision, can take some consolation from the poll which found that voters seem to agree with them - 63% of Labour supporters, 60% of Conservatives, and 51% of Liberal Democrats said they thought these bodies should have a more prominent role.

The church has claimed that although surveys have shown snapshots of Sunday attendances sinking below 1m for the first time three years ago - a statistic so controversial that the church tried to bury it - such figures pay little attention to changing patterns of churchgoing, such as more people attending services in their work lunch hours. Nevertheless, since 1980 the Church of England has suffered a 27% decline in membership, a similar figure to that in the Catholic Church. In a Gallup poll last year however, only 38% of those questioned said they believed Jesus was the Son of God. When the same question was asked in 1957, the comparable figure was 71%. The latest poll, carried out by Opinion Research Business, indicates the extent to which the main churches are failing to capture the imagination of the young or to capitalise on what remains a latent belief in God.

We shall see in a moment. But first let me get an interloper out of the way. This is a wine from Unwins (and Chile), and this time I hope to avoid upsetting any reader - unlike the last time I featured a great Unwins red, when the local branch denied all knowledge of it.

The name is horrifically twee, I grant you, and is enough to make one wince, but the liquid itself produces more sublime emotions as the drinker revels in the dry, dark and faintly exotic fruit, all meaty and deep. There is a dextrous touch of spice to these savoury overtones and a layered finish of considerable oomph. </p> <p>A red to enhance the poshest of dinners - celebrating Lord Sainsbury handing over a Breugel to the nation, perhaps - this is a consummately classy food wine that, though not suited to scrambled or addled branch managers, may find itself in this situation (if so, please make use of the email details at the foot of this column). It rates 16.5 points (out of 20) and costs \u00a37.49. </p> <p>At Sainsbury's, there is nothing so grand (this week). But how does a non-vintage South African Chenin Blanc at \u00a313.99 grab you? A lot of money, yes, but until April 28 it has been reduced to \u00a310.99. This is not your big, rich, OTT chenin, but a good, dry mouthful of solid fruitiness that never tires or goes flabby. Helpfully, Sainsbury's does not require you to own a corkscrew to access this charming little drop, because it comes in a three-litre box with a tap. At its offer price, this is everyday quaffing at 45p a glass, and it rates 15 points at that level of pocketability. </p> <p>There are three further Sainsbury's wines on offer for the same period. Goiya Glaan 1999 (16 points, down to \u00a32.99) is very ripe and rich, firmly textured, with plums, blackcurrants and spice in its make-up. It really gushes with flavour, while retaining some degree of structure. The South African Reserve Selection Pinotage 2000 (16 points, down to \u00a34.49) is unusually dry and a serious-sided pinotage with more pinot character than age. Okay, so it is young and vibrant, but the plums and meaty blackberries are handsomely rigged. Heritage du Rhne 1999 (15 points, on offer at \u00a33.79) is beefy, country bumpkin-style glugging. It has dry, earthy touches to its plums and blackberries, but not every branch has it (call 0800 636262 for details). </p> <p>Over at Somerfield, there are no special offers (this week), and so you will have to dig deeper than normal where this retailer is concerned. South African Cabernet Sauvignon 2000 (16.5 points, \u00a34.49) is superbly woody, with feisty tannins that add loads of character to the dry fruit. It is a bitingly bonny mouthful of liquefied hedgerows.</p> <p>Vacqueyras Domaine de la Soleiade 1999 (16.5 points, \u00a34.99) is the essence of what French country red is all about: characterful, soft, gently tannic, beautifully herby, finely textured. Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon Vina La Rosa 1999 (16.5 points, \u00a34.49, also at Kwik Save) is vivaciously fruity, wonderfully quaffable and has a glorious texture. Espiral Tempranillo Barrique 1999 (16 points, \u00a35.99, not all branches; call 0117 935 6669 for details), from Spain, has loads of spicy plums with great tannins. Very urgent fruit here, keen to please. </p> <p>Beaumes de Venise Ctes du Rhne Villages Rouge 1998 (16 points, \u00a35.49) is a stunning blend of grenache, syrah, mourv\u00e8dre and cinsault, which opens demurely, then goes combative and rich, then calms itself, then goes warm and deep. </p> <p>For the latest wine news, and to email Malcolm Gluck, visit <a href=\"http://www.superplonk.com\">superplonk.com</a></p>",

Given our clay soil, we need to do something about this.</p> <p>One bad area is next to our front path, which is meadow and should be full of bulbs. But many of these - crocuses and wild daffodils, notably - have drowned. It is easier to dig drains if your trenches do not fill with water as you dig them, but we cannot wait. The grass will be lengthening, which makes the job far more difficult. Fergus seems resigned to getting on with it. We shall dig out the top layer of earth to the depth of a spade - otherwise known as a spit.

The turf will stand proud of the overall meadow level, but it will sink in due course.</p> <p>Another big, one-off job, is the cutting back of our yew trees. We have a big cubic buttress of clipped yew which, at one corner, had seriously encroached on a flagstone path where it turns a right-angled bend. The result of this was that the public cut this corner, walking on the grass which, naturally, became worn out with repeated treading.</p> <p>As the four yews that comprise the cube were planted some 90 years ago, we can hardly complain about their bulk (says he, thinking of his own bulk after only 80 years). It is customary to spread a hatchet job of this kind over two or three years, so as to lessen shock to the plants. Well, we have broken with custom and done the whole job in one go. The bushes were healthy enough with signs of growth at the centre, and we shall feed them.</p> <p>I feel pretty confident they'll be okay, especially as they seem unlikely to run into an immediate drought. But we've certainly made them skeletal. It is important in such cases to go right back to the central trunks, from which pretty even regrowth can be expected, and not to leave lateral branches from which regrowth would be uneven at best, with many failing entirely.</p> <p>Yew is one of your best friends when this kind of reducing becomes necessary.

Keeping the turf and weeds clear for a metre radius around the tree stem is not over-doing it, and this area is then mulched with garden compost. Likewise, yew hedges that abut on meadow should be cleared at the base. Unless hedge roots are exposed here, we do not automatically mulch, but we do apply a slow-release fertiliser that will give them a feed during their growing season.</p> <p>All our larger bamboos are grown as specimens, and it makes a great difference to their appearance and presentation if they are annually thinned, which is done by removing all the older, tired canes and accumulated debris within a colony so that you can see right through it and beyond.

A particularly upright and proud-looking bamboo, easily kept within a narrow space, is Semiarundinaria fastuosa. I can enjoy it from where I am writing. But even this spreads a little. Most bamboos spread quite a lot more, and this is the best moment for reducing their circumference. We pot up the detached pieces and grow them for sale.

It gives details of more than 3,000 private gardens across the country, open to the public between now and November, as part of the National Gardens Scheme. Gardens with moats, follies, outrageous plants, picnic spots as well as secret gardens are among the selection. All money raised goes to a multitude of charities. The Yellow Book, published by the National Gardens Scheme, costs \u00a35 and is available in bookshops everywhere. Plant of the week 'Whirligig' is the name of this osteospermum (above) - a daisy-like flower that does well in dry, sunny conditions and is ideal for container plantings. There are about 70 other varieties, some with crimped petals much like the 'Whirligig', others more plain, and coming in a range of colours, from buttermilk to purple.

Everything is relative, and when you compare us to other countries, suddenly things aren't quite so grim. (As the refugees from countries far and near who have made this country the Number One destination on their various itineraries will vouchsafe.) Where else, exactly, is there? The third world? No cheers! America? I'd rather live in a toilet than in the evil empire. Russia? Used to be good, but since the end of communism, the life expectancy has dropped by 10 years, productivity has been cut in half and they pay you in dog food. \"Newly-free eastern Europe\"? Yeah, it's so great there that they're all coming over here. Corrupt France, racist Germany, boring Belgium? Keep 'em!</p> <p>A bit of perspective never goes amiss, and in the midst of all this doom and gloom it's worth remembering what we've got that others haven't. A sense of humour. A love of the underdog. The idea that a corrupt politician is still worth getting upset about. That inbuilt bullshit detector that makes mincemeat of philosophers, politicians and Martin Amis. \"They\" used to talk about the people of England who had not spoken yet; but that might be because \"their\" heirs, the chatterers, haven't shut up long enough to give them a chance. And everything they say is such a downer. I can't help but think that the disgusting behaviour of young Brits abroad might just have something to do with the nonstop disapproval of their \"betters\".</p> <p>It's strange; the liberal establishment can see that it might be counter-productive to tell people they're bad all the time, individually - look at the coochy-coo treatment given to the murderers of James Bulger - but it doesn't seem to occur to them that if you tell a people how crap they are constantly, they might think, well, may as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb.</p> <p>More and more, when it appears to me that this country is rather overcrowded, I long to deport not the mild immigrants but the bellicose natives who have a good word to say for every country but their own. Oi, Mortimer, eff off back to Tuscany. Nigella, Provence for you, luv. And as for Louis de Berni\u00e8res, with his ignorant comments about the \"anti-education, anti-culture attitude of the white working class\" (yeah, and the black working class are queueing up for the opera), it's off to Cephalonia he goes, and let the communists deal with him.

(As the refugees from countries far and near who have made this country the Number One destination on their various itineraries will vouchsafe.) Where else, exactly, is there? The third world? No cheers! America? I'd rather live in a toilet than in the evil empire. Russia? Used to be good, but since the end of communism, the life expectancy has dropped by 10 years, productivity has been cut in half and they pay you in dog food. \"Newly-free eastern Europe\"? Yeah, it's so great there that they're all coming over here. Corrupt France, racist Germany, boring Belgium? Keep 'em! A bit of perspective never goes amiss, and in the midst of all this doom and gloom it's worth remembering what we've got that others haven't. A sense of humour. A love of the underdog. The idea that a corrupt politician is still worth getting upset about. That inbuilt bullshit detector that makes mincemeat of philosophers, politicians and Martin Amis. \"They\" used to talk about the people of England who had not spoken yet; but that might be because \"their\" heirs, the chatterers, haven't shut up long enough to give them a chance. And everything they say is such a downer. I can't help but think that the disgusting behaviour of young Brits abroad might just have something to do with the nonstop disapproval of their \"betters\". It's strange; the liberal establishment can see that it might be counter-productive to tell people they're bad all the time, individually - look at the coochy-coo treatment given to the murderers of James Bulger - but it doesn't seem to occur to them that if you tell a people how crap they are constantly, they might think, well, may as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb. More and more, when it appears to me that this country is rather overcrowded, I long to deport not the mild immigrants but the bellicose natives who have a good word to say for every country but their own. Oi, Mortimer, eff off back to Tuscany. Nigella, Provence for you, luv. And as for Louis de Berni\u00e8res, with his ignorant comments about the \"anti-education, anti-culture attitude of the white working class\" (yeah, and the black working class are queueing up for the opera), it's off to Cephalonia he goes, and let the communists deal with him. With that lot gone, who knows, dear old Blighty might well enjoy a reversal of fortune.",

It is not even clear from the extracts published last Sunday whether Mahmood - posing this time as the personal assistant of a sheikh, rather than as the sheikh himself - actually asked for the gay sex he was so enthusiastically offered by the Countess of Wessex's business partner, Murray Harkin. One suspects that the tapes were edited to cover up Mahmood's contemptible role in soliciting these confidences. But Harkin's boastful advice that the Banyan Tree Hotel in Phuket, Thailand, would be the perfect discreet spot for homosexual encounters with young boys not only helped cost him and Sophie their jobs, but also lost R-JH, their PR firm, its contract with the hotel.

Its self-regulatory body, the Press Complaints Commission, meanwhile brought discredit upon itself with its self-serving, celebrity-studded 10th anniversary party in February. Prince Charles and Prince William attended that event, upholding the image of the monarchy as a threatened institution helplessly thrashing around in search of salvation. Saying \"thank you\" to the PCC for having curbed press harassment of William was a pretty pathetic admission of the media's power over him and his public image.

      "body": "<p>There was a time when Michael Stipe would get offended if you called him a pop star, even if that someone was Andy Warhol, who, of course, conferred the term only as the highest compliment. \"It was, like, 'I'm a musician, so don't you dare call me a pop star.' Andy said, 'So, you're a pop star?' and I went, 'No, I\"m a musician.' He went, 'Michael, you're a pop star,' and I went, 'Andy, I'm a musician.' Then, he said, 'Well, you're very cute.'\" </p> <p>Not for the first time today, Stipe cracks up laughing. He has a good laugh, not hearty but heartfelt, a sort of snorting chuckle. It is not the sort of laugh that I would have expected from someone who often comes across as the most wilfully arty pop star on the planet. It is the perennial puzzle about Stipe: is he really as effortlessly eccentric in his approach to his life and work as he appears to be; or is he someone who has thought long and hard about his bohemian persona and how to maintain it. (Interestingly, \"cute\", in my Concise Oxford Dictionary, is defined as \"clever, shrewd\" and \"ingenious\", as well as \"attractive\".) </p> <p>For 21 years, Stipe has been the enigmatic, much-adored front man of REM, who, like U2, have become one of the biggest-selling rock acts of all time while keeping their souls, sanity and credibility intact. Though Stipe has always been the focus of attention, REM was an organism that collectively transcended the sum of its parts. When drummer, Bill Berry, was forced by ill health to leave in 1997, no one would have been surprised had they called it a day. Though Berry has not been replaced - \"It would have seemed disrespectful,\" as Mike Mills once put it - the group have endured as a three-piece, but the last album, Up, sold disappointingly. Creatively and commercially, then, their new record, Reveal, is a crucial one, though you would never guess it from the taciturn, unruffled Peter Buck and Mills. These two remain pretty much as they always were: solid, unassuming, no-nonsense Southern boys, committed rock fans who, you feel, still can't quite believe that they have been elevated to the pantheon of rock gods. </p> <p>Something has definitely changed in Stipe, however, since I last encountered him in the mid-90s: he seems more open, and more openly mischievous than before, relaxed, even. For someone who is notoriously elliptical in his answers and, of course, in his song lyrics, he is relatively accommodating. He seems at home in the world of pop stardom. \"I take my work very seriously,\" he tells me, almost impatiently, when I press him on this fame thing, \"but I don't take myself seriously. If you don't have a sense of humour about all this, it's like, why do it? It's so phenomenally absurd, what can you do but laugh?\" I remind him that the last time I interviewed him, he'd seemed much more ill at at ease, withdrawn, troubled. </p> <p>\"Did I?\" he asks, for a moment perturbed. \"Oh well, I got over that pretty quickly. It did knock me back a bit when we became so big, so ubiquitous, then I realised that my reaction to it was making me more sick than the thing itself. It was my reaction to the fans' reaction to me that was getting me down. So, I decided there and then to relax into it, and fame has been a rose petal-strewn path ever since.\" </p> <p>Stipe's close friend, Thom Yorke, the equally enigmatic leader of Radiohead and someone who has had his own troubles adjusting to the role of contemporary pop icon, provides a clue as to how Stipe has managed this feat. \"Michael loves all the glamour of pop stardom, but in a mad way. He has fun with the absurdity of it all. He really manages to negotiate the whole thing in such a cool way. When I was close to that whole rock-star-losing-his-marbles stage, he was so generous and protective. I'm okay with it all now and, to tell you the truth, a lot of that is down to him. He looks out for you. That's rare in a business where you meet so many fawning reptiles it just gets fucking depressing most of the time.\" </p> <p>REM began back in 1980, when Stipe, then at art college studying photography, met Mills, Buck and Berry in their home town of Athens, Georgia. The son of an American army helicopter pilot (an upbringing he shares with Marilyn Manson), Stipe's nomadic youth was dominated by the daily news broadcasts from Vietnam, where his father served for the duration of the war. He seems to have been a content, if slightly odd, teenager. (According to a recent article in Q magazine, his college paper was entitled, wait for it, Feral Existence In Doplar Society). He once admitted to feeling \"slightly removed\" throughout his adolescence, a tendency that, one feels, he has turned to his advantage as a rock singer. </p> <p>In 1976, he underwent what he describes as \"the single big epiphanic and defining moment in my life\", when he rushed to the local record store and bought a copy of an album called Horses by Patti Smith on the day of its release. \"That's when I decided to do what I am doing now,\" he tells me. What was it, exactly, about Horses, a record that still stands outside rock tradition in its merging of freeform poetry and primal rock noise, that so enthralled him? \"Exactly?\" he repeats, as if the word is an affront. \"I'm not sure if I've thought about it in exact terms, but it just mesmerised me. I had heard her singles and read about her, but nothing prepared me for this. I remember listening to Birdland and thinking, 'Oh my God. this is ground zero'.\" </p> <p>By the time REM formed, the rawness and often overlooked arty experimentalism of punk had been and gone, smoothed down into something called New Wave, an altogether more radio-friendly pop. The fledgling REM, music fanatics all, were influenced by English groups such as Wire and the Gang Of Four, but initially they tapped into an older US rock tradition best encapsulated by the jangling guitars and chiming harmonies of the Byrds. The group paid their dues, almost unnoticed, on the local Georgia rock circuit alongside more electronic-led local bands with names such as Pylon, the Method Actors and Love Tractor. </p> <p>Then they crisscrossed America on the alternative circuit, crossing paths with such brilliant but short-lived post-punk groups as H\u00fcsker D\u00fc, Black Flag and the Replacements. \"We were like an arty garage band back then,\" the affable Buck, easily the most straight-ahead rocker in the group, explains. \"We just played and played for whoever whoever would hire us. We played pizza parlours, bars, house parties. We played fast songs mainly for audiences that wanted to dance. And Michael just kept writing. Some days, he'd give us a song at sound check and we'd play it that night. We did that for two years, writing and playing and discarding stuff until we were good and ready. See, we always wanted out first record to be one of those records that sounds like it fell, fully formed, from outer space. We wanted it to be like the records that influenced us - the Velvets, the Pretenders, Patti Smith, Television. I think, looking back, we almost succeeded.\" </p> <p>Murmur was indeed one of those records that seemed to fall from the skies. At a time when British rock was in retreat from the twin blights of New Romanticism and synth-pop, Murmur sounded subterranean and otherworldly. Songs such as Radio Free Europe, honed for two years on stage, soared and mesmerised on record. For a long time in the 80s, REM were the music press's best kept secret, a contemporary American rock band whose music seemed out of time, and curiously timeless, and whose lyrics seemed to suggest a whole new language of rock and roll capable of dealing in themes way beyond the received ones of love, lust and essentially adolescent angst. From the start, what set REM apart from their contemporaries, what prevented them from being just another great, no-nonsense American rock band, was the enigmatic figure and enigmatic songs of their lead singer. \"Michael's songs were kind of even more baffling back then,\" says Mike Mills, \"because we had to get used to his take on things. On Murmur, there were these references to weird statues and stuff. It only made sense to me sonically back then. Since then, I've learnt not to be surprised by anything he writes.\" </p> <p>When I first met Stipe, back in 1988, he easily lived up to the image I had carried in my head since hearing early REM albums such as Murmur, Life's Rich Pageant and Document - he was part-Beat poet, part-visionary rock singer. He had long, curly hair and a strange vocabulary that seemed almost arcane: he used words such as \"thereof\" and \"unbeknownst\". His answers came in fits and starts, and his thinking was lateral, to say the least. He told me that the inclusion of mistakes, accidents and typing errors was an essential element of his songwriting approach, and that he had not finished a book since reading Jack Kerouac's On The Road as a teenager, nor listened to rock music since buying Horses. Even then I did not quite believe everything he told me. </p> <p>Our paths crossed again in 1995, when REM were no longer a music press secret but had become the biggest rock group in the world following the crossover success of songs such as Losing My Religion and Everybody Hurts, the first musically jaunty and lyrically baffling like many REM songs, the second stately and stoical and, unlike many REM songs, anthemic. Back then, Stipe was appearing on stage in a T-shirt that read \"SELLOUT\", and was given to odd affectations such as standing stock-still for the entire duration of a performance, or, as he did on that particular night, wearing a hearing aid as a style accessory (shades of our own dear Morrissey, who sported the same with the Smiths, and, as it turns out, is now a close friend). </p> <p>That time around, however, Stipe was intriguing for a whole different set of reasons. His sexuality had long been the subject of music business conjecture - he once described himself as \"an equal opportunity lech\" - and his name had been romantically linked with singer Natalie Merchant, actor Stephen Dorff and even, rock's reigning loudmouth Courtney Love. (In Nick Broomfield's documentary, Kurt &amp; Courtney, she produces an old diary that includes a list of things she must do in order to become famous. At the top, it reads, \"Become friends with Michael Stipe\".) Around this time, too, a macabre rumour had swept the music industry that Stipe was dying of Aids, a rumour that his shaven head and gaunt demeanour did little to dispel. He had recently lost two close friends, the young actor River Phoenix, who had died of a seizure brought on by poly-drug use, and the aforementioned Cobain, who had killed himself. (Love has since spoken of her regret that a short time before Cobain's death she did not \"physically drag\" her husband to the airport after Stipe sent them a pair of plane tickets to Athens, Georgia.) Unsurprisingly, the singer had seemed edgy, preoccupied and uncommunicative when I spoke to him before he took the stage in Chicago, and grew visibly uptight when either of his dead friend's names was mentioned. </p> <p>Back then, REM were touring an album, Monster, which in places seemed as big and ungainly and monolithic as its name. That night's show was lame and uneven, the group floundering during one song when Stipe stumbled over a line, then forgot the next one altogether. I remember thinking that this was a group who were not having fun, whose days were numbered. It was soon afterwards that drummer Bill Berry, who had suffered an aneurysm on stage during the same tour, announced his retirement from REM. Stipe by then had burgeoning extra-curricular activities - he now has a successful production company with films such as Velvet Goldmine, Being John Malkovich and American Movie under its belt, and he recently published a book of photographs, Two Times Intro: On the Road With Patti Smith. Nevertheless the remaining band members persevered, recording an album called Up in 1998. At the time, Stipe said that the record was about, \"Falling down and getting up again\". In fact, Up was the sound of a band trying to stay upright, a strange and disjointed record, not really that upfull at all, but strangely grey and functional. It seemed that the REM had been reduced to a series of recognisable tropes: Stipe's increasingly abstract, seemingly throwaway lyrics tied to a music that was either mildly interesting in a tentatively electronic sort of way, or big and brown and muddy in a stadium rock sort of way. A world away, in fact, from the REM that had blazed a trail with their beautifully crafted rock melodies and mysterious songs. </p> <p>As it turns out, Up was almost their swansong. Throughout its fraught creation, Stipe was suffering from protracted writers' block, which meant the other two had to wait around, doing nothing, for much of the time they were meant to be recording. Buck, who lives in Seattle, grew increasingly angry at having to be away from his family for months on end; the atmosphere soured, and seems to have degenerated into a sulky silence. Things got so bad that Stipe, at the end of his tether, convinced himself that the group had split up already, in their heads: \"I was working on what I thought would be our last will and testament,\" he confessed to Q magazine this month. </p> <p>This almost terminal crisis precipitated what Stipe calls \"a new, relaxed and less pressurised way of working. We tend not to work from a state of complete panic any more.\" </p> <p>I met Stipe on this most recent occasion in a room high up inside the Warner Brothers building on Rockefeller Plaza in the heart of New York; we were surrounded by the kind of paraphernalia that decorates record company offices the world over: gold and silver discs, framed magazine covers and concert posters, press cuttings. In a nearby ante-room, a gaggle of American music journalists are waiting their turn for an audience, snacking on sandwiches and chocolate chip cookies, as the new REM album, Reveal, plays softly on the stereo. This is what, in the PR-mediated world of rock, is called a press day. It is a mind-numbing, soul-draining exercise for all concerned. Today, though, Stipe, slightly camp and easily distracted, is doing his best to enjoy it . </p> <p>When I ask him what the enigmatic title, Reveal, means, he responds with a not untypical riposte. \"Intentionally, nothing. It was plucked out of thin air by our manager at the very last minute. You can take what you want from it, though. You have my blessing.\" Another mischievous grin crosses his face. \"As a writer, and trusted lover of the arts, take it and make of it what you want.\" </p> <p>Would he admit, though, that the title does suggest some of the prevailing themes - the album, for instance, seems full of spiritual imagery and allusion, seems underpinned by the notion of elevation, ascension, of uplift, both physical and spiritual? </p> <p>\"That's an interesting take,\" he nods, apparently serious and reflective, \"and Peter [Buck] has been saying the same thing.\" There is the first of many pauses here, accompanied by a a knitting of the brow.\"Where do you get that from? Which songs in particular?\" I glance at my notes, scribbled hastily on the plane from London to New York. I mention a few song titles: The Lifting, Imitation Of Life, the latter with its echoes of Thomas \u00c0 Kempis's theological treatise, Imitation Of Christ. These are not, I mumble, regular pop songs; they seem to hover around what Brian Eno once pinpointed as one of the key unspoken ideas of our time: spirituality without religion, without the notion of God. Stipe looks startled. \"Um, maybe. I mean, it seems endemic in our generation that, as you get older, you start looking for spiritual meaning. People who reach their forties often seem to start patching together some version of a belief system, pasting together elements of existing religions, maybe a bit of Buddhism or Islam or even a slice of Catholicism. It's the sort of thing you could blow holes in from an academic or theological standpoint, but it's there and it's real. I guess there may be something of that instinct in the songs. It's kind of unconscious, though, it's not thought-out.\" </p> <p>We continue like this for a while, me pitching ideas, possible meanings, possible misinterpretations of these new songs; him batting them back at me. After a while, I start to think that this evasiveness is a strategy: a way of undermining the intrusiveness of an interview, as well of avoiding having to explain, and thus reduce, lyrics that depend for their success on a sense of mystery, an abstraction. Stipe, of course, is acutely aware of all this. \"I really don't want to reveal anything about a character or a song,\" he admits, \"because I can remember, as a teenager, a record falling into my lap, and how magical and mysterious and revolutionary and unbelievably life-altering even one song on a record like that can be. I would hate to diminish or be unfaithful to that notion. Plus, I maintain that my take, my interpretation of what my songs are about, is, in the whole world, the least important take. I wrote them, but that does not give me some divine insight into their meaning.\" </p> <p>But there are some definitive things you can say about Stipe's songs: they tend to avoid the first person and the confessional mode; they tend to be non-gender specific, even the occasional love songs; and, in terms of their often magical, occasionally unfathomable, free association, they are, alongside Thom Yorke's output, far removed from the abiding notion of the pop song. Even the poppiest Michael Stipe songs - Losing My Religion, Man On The Moon, The Great Beyond and the new REM single, Imitation Of Life - are littered with word play, layered with possible meanings.\"The best songs are the ones I don't have to think about, the ones I don't over-think or have to craft in order to complete. I think the unthought songs, the ones that come pouring out of me, are more real: the vomit songs. Losing My Religion was a vomit song. Man On The Moon. Sad Professor on the last album. Those are the songs that are truly inspired, they just come pouring out. I don't feel I'm a holy conduit to some bigger thing that comes dropping from the heavens. It's just something that I truly believe is inside all of us, whether we can access it or not.\" He adds, \"I know I've written a good song when it just comes out of me like a hair ball, like a cat vomiting.\" </p> <p>The new album, Reveal, though not immediately accessible, thankfully sees the group - and Stipe in particular - in inspired form: it sounds like they have delved deep in order to reinvent themselves. Unconsciously or otherwise, this is an album that seems to revisit the almost Arcadian landscape and pastoral imagery of early psychedelic rock: the drowsy underwater feel of Syd Barrett era Pink Floyd on All I Want, with its references to seahorses and dragonflies; the sun-drenched, acid-tinged harmonies of Surf's Up era Beach Boys on Summer Turns To High. Here, Stipe seems to be tapping into a whole other level of his unconscious. \"For me, it is all about the present, about right now,\" he says, \"and that's a big change. I used to wonder, would this song or that song stand up in 10 years' time. Now, I don't care. It seems more important that I can suck something out of the air and put it out again as something that speaks of that moment. That, to me, is real, and I think people are looking for the real in music again. All the constructed, mathematical, left-brain, male music is just . . .\" he pauses, searching for exactly the right word\"... tired.\" </p> <p>On the plane back to London, I listen to this odd, fractured, truncated conversation with Stipe, and decide that he is, after all, as eccentric as he appears to be, and that he is also someone who has thought long and hard about his bohemian persona and the maintaining of it. He is, in fact, the modern pop star par excellence: he dances with his celebrity in much the same way as he dances with language - flirtatiously, elusively, mischievously. \"I used to think he was quite mad,\" Thom Yorke tells me a few days later, \"because there is this improvisational quality to everything he does, from writing to talking to singing. He's improvising all the time, even when he's not being a songwriter. In fact, he spends a lot of his time forgetting that he's a songwriter.You can quite easily, and without thinking about it, fill your life with music and get overwhelmed by that kind of living but, with Michael, it's not a 24 hours a day thing. He tries his best to live in the moment. That\", says Yorke, seriously, admiringly, \"is a real and beautiful thing\" </p> <p>\u0095 REM's new single, Imitation Of Life, is released on April 30. The album, Reveal, on May 14.</p>",

Nevertheless the remaining band members persevered, recording an album called Up in 1998. At the time, Stipe said that the record was about, \"Falling down and getting up again\". In fact, Up was the sound of a band trying to stay upright, a strange and disjointed record, not really that upfull at all, but strangely grey and functional. It seemed that the REM had been reduced to a series of recognisable tropes: Stipe's increasingly abstract, seemingly throwaway lyrics tied to a music that was either mildly interesting in a tentatively electronic sort of way, or big and brown and muddy in a stadium rock sort of way. A world away, in fact, from the REM that had blazed a trail with their beautifully crafted rock melodies and mysterious songs. As it turns out, Up was almost their swansong. Throughout its fraught creation, Stipe was suffering from protracted writers' block, which meant the other two had to wait around, doing nothing, for much of the time they were meant to be recording. Buck, who lives in Seattle, grew increasingly angry at having to be away from his family for months on end; the atmosphere soured, and seems to have degenerated into a sulky silence. Things got so bad that Stipe, at the end of his tether, convinced himself that the group had split up already, in their heads: \"I was working on what I thought would be our last will and testament,\" he confessed to Q magazine this month. This almost terminal crisis precipitated what Stipe calls \"a new, relaxed and less pressurised way of working. We tend not to work from a state of complete panic any more.\" I met Stipe on this most recent occasion in a room high up inside the Warner Brothers building on Rockefeller Plaza in the heart of New York; we were surrounded by the kind of paraphernalia that decorates record company offices the world over: gold and silver discs, framed magazine covers and concert posters, press cuttings. In a nearby ante-room, a gaggle of American music journalists are waiting their turn for an audience, snacking on sandwiches and chocolate chip cookies, as the new REM album, Reveal, plays softly on the stereo. This is what, in the PR-mediated world of rock, is called a press day. It is a mind-numbing, soul-draining exercise for all concerned. Today, though, Stipe, slightly camp and easily distracted, is doing his best to enjoy it . When I ask him what the enigmatic title, Reveal, means, he responds with a not untypical riposte. \"Intentionally, nothing. It was plucked out of thin air by our manager at the very last minute. You can take what you want from it, though. You have my blessing.\" Another mischievous grin crosses his face. \"As a writer, and trusted lover of the arts, take it and make of it what you want.\" Would he admit, though, that the title does suggest some of the prevailing themes - the album, for instance, seems full of spiritual imagery and allusion, seems underpinned by the notion of elevation, ascension, of uplift, both physical and spiritual? \"That's an interesting take,\" he nods, apparently serious and reflective, \"and Peter [Buck] has been saying the same thing.\" There is the first of many pauses here, accompanied by a a knitting of the brow.\"Where do you get that from? Which songs in particular?\" I glance at my notes, scribbled hastily on the plane from London to New York. I mention a few song titles: The Lifting, Imitation Of Life, the latter with its echoes of Thomas \u00c0 Kempis's theological treatise, Imitation Of Christ. These are not, I mumble, regular pop songs; they seem to hover around what Brian Eno once pinpointed as one of the key unspoken ideas of our time: spirituality without religion, without the notion of God. Stipe looks startled. \"Um, maybe. I mean, it seems endemic in our generation that, as you get older, you start looking for spiritual meaning. People who reach their forties often seem to start patching together some version of a belief system, pasting together elements of existing religions, maybe a bit of Buddhism or Islam or even a slice of Catholicism. It's the sort of thing you could blow holes in from an academic or theological standpoint, but it's there and it's real. I guess there may be something of that instinct in the songs. It's kind of unconscious, though, it's not thought-out.\" We continue like this for a while, me pitching ideas, possible meanings, possible misinterpretations of these new songs; him batting them back at me. After a while, I start to think that this evasiveness is a strategy: a way of undermining the intrusiveness of an interview, as well of avoiding having to explain, and thus reduce, lyrics that depend for their success on a sense of mystery, an abstraction. Stipe, of course, is acutely aware of all this. \"I really don't want to reveal anything about a character or a song,\" he admits, \"because I can remember, as a teenager, a record falling into my lap, and how magical and mysterious and revolutionary and unbelievably life-altering even one song on a record like that can be. I would hate to diminish or be unfaithful to that notion. Plus, I maintain that my take, my interpretation of what my songs are about, is, in the whole world, the least important take. I wrote them, but that does not give me some divine insight into their meaning.\" But there are some definitive things you can say about Stipe's songs: they tend to avoid the first person and the confessional mode; they tend to be non-gender specific, even the occasional love songs; and, in terms of their often magical, occasionally unfathomable, free association, they are, alongside Thom Yorke's output, far removed from the abiding notion of the pop song. Even the poppiest Michael Stipe songs - Losing My Religion, Man On The Moon, The Great Beyond and the new REM single, Imitation Of Life - are littered with word play, layered with possible meanings.\"The best songs are the ones I don't have to think about, the ones I don't over-think or have to craft in order to complete. I think the unthought songs, the ones that come pouring out of me, are more real: the vomit songs. Losing My Religion was a vomit song. Man On The Moon. Sad Professor on the last album. Those are the songs that are truly inspired, they just come pouring out. I don't feel I'm a holy conduit to some bigger thing that comes dropping from the heavens. It's just something that I truly believe is inside all of us, whether we can access it or not.\" He adds, \"I know I've written a good song when it just comes out of me like a hair ball, like a cat vomiting.\" The new album, Reveal, though not immediately accessible, thankfully sees the group - and Stipe in particular - in inspired form: it sounds like they have delved deep in order to reinvent themselves. Unconsciously or otherwise, this is an album that seems to revisit the almost Arcadian landscape and pastoral imagery of early psychedelic rock: the drowsy underwater feel of Syd Barrett era Pink Floyd on All I Want, with its references to seahorses and dragonflies; the sun-drenched, acid-tinged harmonies of Surf's Up era Beach Boys on Summer Turns To High. Here, Stipe seems to be tapping into a whole other level of his unconscious. \"For me, it is all about the present, about right now,\" he says, \"and that's a big change. I used to wonder, would this song or that song stand up in 10 years' time. Now, I don't care. It seems more important that I can suck something out of the air and put it out again as something that speaks of that moment. That, to me, is real, and I think people are looking for the real in music again. All the constructed, mathematical, left-brain, male music is just . . .\" he pauses, searching for exactly the right word\"... tired.\" On the plane back to London, I listen to this odd, fractured, truncated conversation with Stipe, and decide that he is, after all, as eccentric as he appears to be, and that he is also someone who has thought long and hard about his bohemian persona and the maintaining of it. He is, in fact, the modern pop star par excellence: he dances with his celebrity in much the same way as he dances with language - flirtatiously, elusively, mischievously. \"I used to think he was quite mad,\" Thom Yorke tells me a few days later, \"because there is this improvisational quality to everything he does, from writing to talking to singing. He's improvising all the time, even when he's not being a songwriter. In fact, he spends a lot of his time forgetting that he's a songwriter.You can quite easily, and without thinking about it, fill your life with music and get overwhelmed by that kind of living but, with Michael, it's not a 24 hours a day thing. He tries his best to live in the moment. That\", says Yorke, seriously, admiringly, \"is a real and beautiful thing\" \u0095 REM's new single, Imitation Of Life, is released on April 30. The album, Reveal, on May 14.",

      "body": "<p>Far, far away, beyond the Caucasus mountains and on the steppes that stretch to Siberia, lies the autonomous state of Kalmykia. It occupies almost 30,000 square miles of the vast lowlands of the Northern Caspian Depression, and is peopled by a remote tribe of Mongols from Tibet. They roamed the region from the start of the 16th century, finally settling 100 years later south of the Volga, where they herded cattle and sheep.</p> <p>Every year, in celebration of their nomadic traditions, they hold a cultural festival, the Jangariada, a kind of Mongol eisteddfod, named after the warrior hero of a Kalmyk epic. In song and verse, weird ululaic renditions of the exploits of the great Jangar ring out across the boundless steppes; and feats of archery, javelin throwing, wrestling and lassoing are performed. Sheep, munching contentedly around the yurt tents, are slaughtered. And there is vodka.</p> <p>But the great centrepiece of the festival is the horse race to end all horse races: a 35-mile flat-out gallop across the steppes, completed in scarcely more than an hour and a half. It is a cavalry charge of epic proportions, for which men, women and boys train all year, competing in 20-mile races far out in the wilderness for the right to represent their region. The race is a siren call to horsemen across the flatlands. Somehow, I heard it on the Sussex Downs, and resolved to answer the call.</p> <p>Just getting to Kalmykia demands reserves of guile and stamina to find a way through the Soviet-style bureaucracy. Finally, permission to enter the state was granted by the president himself, Kirsan Ilumshinov, with the further promise of a personal audience. The promise of a white Volga that would meet us at the airport, however, came to nothing, but at least we found rooms in a hotel in Elista, the capital. They were a little spartan, admittedly, and it was several days before the secret of hot water was revealed: it was available, in buckets, from the babushka down the corridor, who could also provide early morning calls by shouting from the end of the bed at the top of her voice, emitting a noise like a bullhorn.</p> <p>In the hotel's bar and restaurant, regarded as the epitome of chic, there was vodka galore. The prospect of a European riding in the Jangariada proved to be exciting news - some doubters thought it a little ridiculous. How could it be possible? A demonstration of the Lester Piggott seat (shortest possible stirrups, bum in the air) attracted great interest and a spirited rival version by a huge Kalmyk who referred to himself as Budmar - \"Me Bad Boy\". To prove his point, he ordered several platters of caviar and vats of wine and vodka, with serious consequences for his mount, a chair. A table of Buddhist priests looked on tolerantly, lining their stomachs in preparation for the conference they were to attend the next day.</p> <p>The following morning we were greeted by an overcast sky, an interpreter - a Kalmyk student - and a representative of the president's press office, who announced, with great charm, that almost nothing was immediately possible, nor was likely to be in the near future. A horse to ride in the race began to seem an unlikely prospect.</p> <p>But there is a racecourse in Elista, with horses in the stables, a stand, and a weed-strewn trackmarked out in an erratic way with logs and string around its perimeter. The horses were not Newmarket types, to be sure, but they were still horses, not the hard-bitten ponies of the steppes that work all day with the sheep and cattle.</p> <p>The stables were arranged in long barns, their central aisles cool and swept, while the boxes had earthen floors with a meagre covering of shavings and sweet-smelling hay. In the tack room, next to the lair that served as an office for the stable manager, there were bridles with eggbutt snaffles, some with running martingales, and leather saddles from Moscow and Rostov-on-Don, where there is serious racing. From various doors along the way peered curious heads, equine and human. Who were these strange people who had come to see them? Some ragged childrengathered in corners to watch what would happen.</p> <p>Put the fellow on a horse and see what happens appeared to be the plan. First, a good-looking seven-year-old chestnut stallion was produced, whose fate by all accounts was to be a show-jumper. Next, a sweet thoroughbred yearling bay filly, with cow hocks and an odd-looking near fore; a granddaughter of the French stallion Behistoun, she had come down from Moscow. Then a bay mare was led out and saddled up, and it seemed time to make a fool of myself.</p> <p>There was a misunderstanding regarding the length of the leathers - they clearly thought that all modern Europeans ride like Frankie Dettori, with their knees underneath their chins. The mare was kind and walked well on a long rein, so that it was possible for me to leave the assembled group of onlookers; a Kalmyk jockey with the air of a man who knew what he was doing, rode alongside me on a coltish chestnut. The mare appeared to enjoy her outing, comfortably falling into an easy canter, light on the hands and very decently ignoring the chestnut, which was making a meal of it. After an hour she was back in her box with her pride, and mine, intact. I received assurances that the following morning there would be a specialist distance horse waiting for me, ready to take on the great challenge of the Jangariada.</p> <p>Horses were being shipped in on the back of open trucks to prepare for the race. Russian trucks are formidable, with high chassis, monstrous snouts and growling engines. In the back of one was a camel, its humps showing above the tailboard and its head stuck over the cab. Many hours later he was discovered eating one of the felt yurts, the peak within comfortable reach of his slavering mouth.</p> <p>The racecourse was beginning to fill with tents of Kalmyks from outlying regions, each decorated with distinctive displays. Over at the stables, the horses were settling in, each embodying the hopes of its district. The course for the race had been marked out across the steppes, and it was time for a preliminary inspection. For a fee, one of the horse breeders who had come into town offered to drive us around. His name was Bassan and he was already solid with drink, his impassiveness as broad as his shoulders.</p> <p>The start of the race was on the edge of town, just past the prison. Bassan lurched the Jeep off the road and steered towards the interminable landscape, featureless but for a line of telegraph poles that stretched out to nowhere. \"Here,\" he announced with portent, \"this is where it begins.\" There was nothing there, no marker or sign, just a track that disappeared into a great unknown. For the first time the prospect seemed chilling - this was going to be no merry chase around a sylvan Fontwell Park. Bassan stamped on the pedal and the Jeep roared off down the track. The ground was bone-hard, and made the vehicle racket along with fantastic jarring jolts. Bassan was in no mood to ease off, as if to prepare us for what lay in store the next day. After about 10 miles, he screeched to a halt. \"If you win tomorrow, we'll slaughter an ox and drink for three days,\" he declared. We'd covered not a third of the course. Then he was off again, gunning along the track as if the hordes of Genghis Khan were on his tail.</p> <p>An hour later he breasted at speed the rise leading to the crumbling walls of the racecourse, where the race was to end, and drew up by the stables. He said nothing for a moment; then grinned, shook his head and stepped into the dust cloud surrounding his Jeep with an enigmatic expression. Our interpreter took it to mean that each man was responsible for his own fate, which did not bode well.</p> <p>There followed a meeting with the organiser of the Jangariada, conducted with the utmost pomp and dignity. It took place at dusk in the centre of the track, cohorts to our right and left, as if we were discussing the rules of engagement for a great battle to be fought the next day. We were reminded of the remarkable history of the Kalmyk people, of their journey from the Mongol lands far to the east, of their culture, their nomadic husbandry, their plight at the hands of Stalin and, above all, of the significance of the race the following day. It was impressive stuff. But it was growing cold and many of the assembled group disappeared into their tents.</p> <p>Everything the organiser said was true, something well understood by Ilumshinov, who has skilfully played on the Kalmyk national identity to bolster his popularity. He knows that after the battle of Stalingrad Stalin shipped the entire Kalmyk population to Siberia, 300 miles to the north, as punishment for their supposed collaboration with the Germans, and that only half of them came back alive. There is a monument to this genocide on the south side of town, facing out into the wilderness, and not far from Ilumshinov's own self-aggrandising Chess City, a weird model village that would sit easily in Swindon.</p> <p>Ilumshinov has, through his support of the chess world and the expenditure of a sizeable portion of his state's GDP, earned himself another term as president of Fide, the international chess federation. He also sponsored the Kasparov-Fischer match to the tune of $1m, purportedly from his own pocket. Quite how this 36-year-old native Kalmyk came by his wealth - amounting to billions, he claims - in a state poor even by Russia's standards is hard to fathom. The promised interview with him did not materialise: first, he was reported to be in Minsk and then in Sydney for the Olympics.</p> <p>There was more bad news to come when the director of the racecourse, himself a former steeplechase jockey (he rode in the 1986 Pardubice in Czechoslovakia), regretfully announced that my horse had not arrived. It was a bitter blow. I pleaded, cajoled, tried not to weep. Finally, he smiled, and agreed to let me ride his own horse, but warned that I should take care of it since it was not fit. I promised him that my hands were like silk, that his horse wouldn't even know that he'd been in a race. \"Yeah, yeah,\" his face said, \"I've heard all that before. Just take care of him.\"</p> <p>The evening wore on. Improbable deals were suggested by the men in the bar, chiefly involving the export of illegal caviar, while I was voted the Housewives' Choice on the dance floor. Decorum was impeccable, but they certainly enjoyed themselves.</p> <p>The great day dawned, cool and sullen. At the stables, horses were being groomed, tunics unpacked, fires being lit by the tents while the tethered sheep looked on in ovine ignorance. A stable groom gingerly led the way to the box of the racecourse director's horse. \"Be careful when you go in,\" said the groom. \"He bites.\" That sounded promising - a tiger of the steppes awaited me. The door swung open. There in the box stood a surly and malevolent grey, ears laid back, a veritable Boris of a horse, with thick shoulders and cojones you could play football with. There had clearly been a mistake; I turned to the groom, who had taken several steps backwards. Out of the corner of my eye I saw Boris swing his head towards me. Luckily, I got my elbow up into his teeth before he could get any purchase on flesh. He jerked his head back at the parry, but then stood back, content with this opening skirmish, like a boxer first tasting blood in his mouth and looking forward with relish to the fight ahead. You'll hear more of this, he seemed to be promising.</p> <p>Outside, horsemen were milling around the tents, while the camel disdainfully sat on a carpet - there was no doubt that he intended to eat it, and was trying to hide it. Bunting fluttered in the wind; children, dressed in outlandish costumes, ran back and forth. The churlish Boris was led out and saddled up, and then proffered by the groom, who was clearly curious as to what I would do next.</p> <p>I checked the girth; it was a move Boris resented and he quickly let me know. But once I was in the saddle he was solid beneath me, or possibly asleep. The saddle was comfortable, the leathers again a little short but easily adjusted (Boris resented this, too). Then we tried to take a few steps forward. Squatting in the shade of the stables, three young Kalmyk boys, each wearing a bandanna and tunic, watched with interest. Boris disappointed them. He proceeded agreeably in the right direction, stopped when I asked him, and sighed heavily, quite uninterested in the lean and fleet racehorses circling about us.</p> <p>On the course, the field was wheeling around, ready to canter in a parade in front of the stands before being led out on to the steppe for the start. In all, there were 54 horses competing. There were men with gnarled, weather-beaten faces, young boys and several women - half the field dressed in tunics, the rest in whatever clothes they probably woke up in, some with boots, some with gym shoes or sandals, many without saddles but all bearing a cloth with a number on. It was a circus sight, all of it lost on Boris, who had turned his head to sniff my foot a couple of times and was now thinking of other things.</p> <p>The field moved off at a trot, then a canter, then a gallop, with shouts and cries from riders and onlookers alike. Boris perked up; he was enjoying himself, and shouldered aside several in his path, even trying a playful buck. Unfortunately, he took away the back legs of a light bay on his nearside, which stumbled, throwing the young boy who was riding him bareback. I grabbed the back of the boy's shirt, heaved him back on, and was rewarded with a nervous smile - and this wasn't even the start. The stakes were high. The winner would receive the sensational prize of a Russian four-wheel drive; second, a fridge; the third would take home a horse as a trophy. I wondered if fourth place might garner me a hen.</p> <p>A two-mile walk still separated the field from the edge of the steppe and the start of the race. The riders around me chatted amicably enough, possibly about the price of sheep, until Boris kicked an innocent-looking gelding, which he clearly felt was encroaching on his path. I seized the moment, and hit him hard several times on his quarters in a tight turn. There were warning shouts from the other riders, which I took to mean that I should leave him alone.</p> <p>Actually, I had already been told that it was perilous even to show Boris a stick, let alone hit him with it. As it turned out, he was unruffled. If he felt the stick at all, he didn't begrudge it. I began to realise why he was so dear to the director's heart. At last we reached the plateau. At the front of the pack stood a ramshackle, moustachioed man barking instructions as if we were in the weighing room before the Grand National. The riders began to concentrate, muttering incantations to their horses. Then the tide swept forward and submerged the starter, gathered to a rush and charged. The game was on.</p> <p>To his credit, Boris proved to be a rock, but not much faster. He preferred a kind of sedentary, comfortable motion, covering the ground with dignity and a fearsome knee action. This was easy on the hands, even a pleasure, despite the dirt being thrown up in the headlong flight. We went on like this for a while, perhaps a mile or so, as small boys sped past us, cocked up like weasels over the mangy withers of their mounts, bouncing and smiling, with their coats and tunics flung out to the wind behind them.</p> <p>It was exhilarating, and I shouted out to a passing rider, just for the hell of it. He shouted back, but his words were blown away across the steppe. We were going a decent clip at this point, certainly as far as Boris was concerned. His locomotive powers were more diesel than high-octane. But already the field was thinning. Off to the right one horse careened away into the middle distance, before coming to ahalt, solitary and panting; the rider's silhouette was slumped forward, his legs dead and dangling. The image lasted no more than a moment as a horse checked and stumbled in front of us. Boris neatly changed legs and went past with a yard to spare, no doubt to accommodate his girth rather than my leg.</p> <p>This was going tidily enough. I seemed to have beneath me, if not pace, then at least resolution. We had settled into a good canter, two or three other competitors were within a hundred yards ahead of us, and the leaders blistering a dusty trail perhaps a furlong beyond. Most had fallen away; I was now in the company of riders with grim determination, their horses breathing regularly even as they skipped over a fault in the ground. They were fabulously agile and sure-footed.</p> <p>It had something of the feel of a good five-mile point across open country, except with another 30 miles to go. The cloud of dust kicked up by the leaders' group was beginning to disappear into the distance; I asked Boris to quicken a little in order to stay in touch. The response was immediate. Some truly terrible sounds began to emerge from beneath me, a kind of sobbing and heaving and gasping. It seemed Boris was coming to the end of his tether. He pulled himself up within a few yards, like a disabled half-back shuddering to a halt. I dismounted, loosened his girth and went up to the front end. It was a sorry sight. His head was down, his eyes rolling, like an exhausted clubman who has been asked to run for a bus rather than take his usual taxi. Oh God, I thought, what have I done?</p> <p>The whole thing was a charade, of course, a sort of Russian joke. When Boris had worked out that I was no longer on his back, he lifted his head, nudged me in the chest and looked around. We were alone, with nothing between us and the distant horizon. But then I saw, lying low in the landscape, the squat shape of the prison, which I knew was no more than a mile or two from the racecourse.</p> <p>We set off in that direction, the reins looped in my hand, Boris walking companionably beside me. Had a hawk seen us, hovering high in the huge sky, it might well have wondered what our purpose was. It seemed we had none. The solitariness of our situation heightened a kind of surreal camaraderie that I now felt for Boris. He might have been a Russian general, deserted by his men in a terrible battle, wandering in an empty no man's land but curiously content with his lot. I was touched. His feet kicked at the scrub, sewn with wild lavender, that sent up a heavenly smell. His ears were forward, his belly swung to his gait. I admit that I kissed him. He was surprised.</p> <p>By walking back directly to the prison we were cutting across a large segment of the full course, which formed a circle. After three-quarters of an hour of our idyll on the plains we found ourselves ahead of the field and just a mile and a half from the finish. At this last turn there was a hollow and a small grove of trees. It was a good place to lie low.</p> <p>Sooner than expected, the dust cloud appeared, far down the railway tracks. The shimmering figures of two, three, four, then five horsemen became clear. There was barely time to tighten Boris's girth - with more groans - and get on board before they were upon us. The five leaders came round the bend in a pack, still galloping, the horses soaked in sweat, their riders wild-eyed and pale. Boris reared up like a bear, wheeled round and set off in pursuit. There was a chance that we might make it to the finish with the pack.</p> <p>It was a forlorn hope. Even after a lazy walk, and his rivals exhausted after nearly 35 miles of galloping behind them, he couldn't keep up. As we reached the racecourse, there was just time to see, at the far end, two horses flash past the post, neck and neck. The third had careered off the track and was rudderless in the outfield, its rider helpless to steer any longer. Two onlookers grabbed the horse and dragged it over the line, where the rider fell to the ground almost unconscious. It was heroic.</p> <p>They carried the winning jockey from his horse, a good idea since he couldn't walk. He looked no more than a boy, but was, in fact, Vladimir Berukaev, an 18-year-old from the Ketchenerovsky region, 200 miles away. He was flung up on to the shoulders of his admirers and borne to his gleaming prize, the four-wheel-drive. Family and friends crammed in around him as he stroked the gear lever and fondled the steering wheel. Press cameras flashed in his exhausted and proud face. But not even his pride could conceal the fact that this was his first encounter with a driving seat.</p> <p>Back on the course, as a flurry of wind flung up the thin soil, Vladimir's horse was being walked around, his joints stiffening up but remarkably cool to the touch. Music blared out over a Tannoy system. The minister of culture, there to present prizes, was jostled aside by the press of onlookers. The few sheep still around began to look nervous. Only the camel was unconcerned. He'd seen it all before.</p> <p>At seven the following morning, the racecourse was empty, but still it had the feeling of an arena that had seen great glory. The tents had gone, and weeds and rubbish covered the infield where they had been. Over in the stables stood the winning horse, cool, disinterested. The truck to take him home arrived, its driver falling out of the cab in a stupor.</p> <p>Boris was in much the same condition as when I first met him. I bent down to feel his legs - they were cool and hard. He smelled my back, thought about biting out my backbone, but instead neatly, and kindly, kneed me in the balls.</p>",

It occupies almost 30,000 square miles of the vast lowlands of the Northern Caspian Depression, and is peopled by a remote tribe of Mongols from Tibet. They roamed the region from the start of the 16th century, finally settling 100 years later south of the Volga, where they herded cattle and sheep. Every year, in celebration of their nomadic traditions, they hold a cultural festival, the Jangariada, a kind of Mongol eisteddfod, named after the warrior hero of a Kalmyk epic. In song and verse, weird ululaic renditions of the exploits of the great Jangar ring out across the boundless steppes; and feats of archery, javelin throwing, wrestling and lassoing are performed. Sheep, munching contentedly around the yurt tents, are slaughtered. And there is vodka. But the great centrepiece of the festival is the horse race to end all horse races: a 35-mile flat-out gallop across the steppes, completed in scarcely more than an hour and a half. It is a cavalry charge of epic proportions, for which men, women and boys train all year, competing in 20-mile races far out in the wilderness for the right to represent their region. The race is a siren call to horsemen across the flatlands. Somehow, I heard it on the Sussex Downs, and resolved to answer the call. Just getting to Kalmykia demands reserves of guile and stamina to find a way through the Soviet-style bureaucracy. Finally, permission to enter the state was granted by the president himself, Kirsan Ilumshinov, with the further promise of a personal audience. The promise of a white Volga that would meet us at the airport, however, came to nothing, but at least we found rooms in a hotel in Elista, the capital. They were a little spartan, admittedly, and it was several days before the secret of hot water was revealed: it was available, in buckets, from the babushka down the corridor, who could also provide early morning calls by shouting from the end of the bed at the top of her voice, emitting a noise like a bullhorn. In the hotel's bar and restaurant, regarded as the epitome of chic, there was vodka galore. The prospect of a European riding in the Jangariada proved to be exciting news - some doubters thought it a little ridiculous. How could it be possible? A demonstration of the Lester Piggott seat (shortest possible stirrups, bum in the air) attracted great interest and a spirited rival version by a huge Kalmyk who referred to himself as Budmar - \"Me Bad Boy\". To prove his point, he ordered several platters of caviar and vats of wine and vodka, with serious consequences for his mount, a chair. A table of Buddhist priests looked on tolerantly, lining their stomachs in preparation for the conference they were to attend the next day. The following morning we were greeted by an overcast sky, an interpreter - a Kalmyk student - and a representative of the president's press office, who announced, with great charm, that almost nothing was immediately possible, nor was likely to be in the near future. A horse to ride in the race began to seem an unlikely prospect. But there is a racecourse in Elista, with horses in the stables, a stand, and a weed-strewn trackmarked out in an erratic way with logs and string around its perimeter. The horses were not Newmarket types, to be sure, but they were still horses, not the hard-bitten ponies of the steppes that work all day with the sheep and cattle. The stables were arranged in long barns, their central aisles cool and swept, while the boxes had earthen floors with a meagre covering of shavings and sweet-smelling hay. In the tack room, next to the lair that served as an office for the stable manager, there were bridles with eggbutt snaffles, some with running martingales, and leather saddles from Moscow and Rostov-on-Don, where there is serious racing. From various doors along the way peered curious heads, equine and human. Who were these strange people who had come to see them? Some ragged childrengathered in corners to watch what would happen. Put the fellow on a horse and see what happens appeared to be the plan. First, a good-looking seven-year-old chestnut stallion was produced, whose fate by all accounts was to be a show-jumper. Next, a sweet thoroughbred yearling bay filly, with cow hocks and an odd-looking near fore; a granddaughter of the French stallion Behistoun, she had come down from Moscow. Then a bay mare was led out and saddled up, and it seemed time to make a fool of myself. There was a misunderstanding regarding the length of the leathers - they clearly thought that all modern Europeans ride like Frankie Dettori, with their knees underneath their chins. The mare was kind and walked well on a long rein, so that it was possible for me to leave the assembled group of onlookers; a Kalmyk jockey with the air of a man who knew what he was doing, rode alongside me on a coltish chestnut. The mare appeared to enjoy her outing, comfortably falling into an easy canter, light on the hands and very decently ignoring the chestnut, which was making a meal of it. After an hour she was back in her box with her pride, and mine, intact. I received assurances that the following morning there would be a specialist distance horse waiting for me, ready to take on the great challenge of the Jangariada. Horses were being shipped in on the back of open trucks to prepare for the race. Russian trucks are formidable, with high chassis, monstrous snouts and growling engines. In the back of one was a camel, its humps showing above the tailboard and its head stuck over the cab. Many hours later he was discovered eating one of the felt yurts, the peak within comfortable reach of his slavering mouth. The racecourse was beginning to fill with tents of Kalmyks from outlying regions, each decorated with distinctive displays. Over at the stables, the horses were settling in, each embodying the hopes of its district. The course for the race had been marked out across the steppes, and it was time for a preliminary inspection. For a fee, one of the horse breeders who had come into town offered to drive us around. His name was Bassan and he was already solid with drink, his impassiveness as broad as his shoulders. The start of the race was on the edge of town, just past the prison. Bassan lurched the Jeep off the road and steered towards the interminable landscape, featureless but for a line of telegraph poles that stretched out to nowhere. \"Here,\" he announced with portent, \"this is where it begins.\" There was nothing there, no marker or sign, just a track that disappeared into a great unknown. For the first time the prospect seemed chilling - this was going to be no merry chase around a sylvan Fontwell Park. Bassan stamped on the pedal and the Jeep roared off down the track. The ground was bone-hard, and made the vehicle racket along with fantastic jarring jolts. Bassan was in no mood to ease off, as if to prepare us for what lay in store the next day. After about 10 miles, he screeched to a halt. \"If you win tomorrow, we'll slaughter an ox and drink for three days,\" he declared. We'd covered not a third of the course. Then he was off again, gunning along the track as if the hordes of Genghis Khan were on his tail. An hour later he breasted at speed the rise leading to the crumbling walls of the racecourse, where the race was to end, and drew up by the stables. He said nothing for a moment; then grinned, shook his head and stepped into the dust cloud surrounding his Jeep with an enigmatic expression. Our interpreter took it to mean that each man was responsible for his own fate, which did not bode well. There followed a meeting with the organiser of the Jangariada, conducted with the utmost pomp and dignity. It took place at dusk in the centre of the track, cohorts to our right and left, as if we were discussing the rules of engagement for a great battle to be fought the next day. We were reminded of the remarkable history of the Kalmyk people, of their journey from the Mongol lands far to the east, of their culture, their nomadic husbandry, their plight at the hands of Stalin and, above all, of the significance of the race the following day. It was impressive stuff. But it was growing cold and many of the assembled group disappeared into their tents. Everything the organiser said was true, something well understood by Ilumshinov, who has skilfully played on the Kalmyk national identity to bolster his popularity. He knows that after the battle of Stalingrad Stalin shipped the entire Kalmyk population to Siberia, 300 miles to the north, as punishment for their supposed collaboration with the Germans, and that only half of them came back alive. There is a monument to this genocide on the south side of town, facing out into the wilderness, and not far from Ilumshinov's own self-aggrandising Chess City, a weird model village that would sit easily in Swindon. Ilumshinov has, through his support of the chess world and the expenditure of a sizeable portion of his state's GDP, earned himself another term as president of Fide, the international chess federation. He also sponsored the Kasparov-Fischer match to the tune of $1m, purportedly from his own pocket. Quite how this 36-year-old native Kalmyk came by his wealth - amounting to billions, he claims - in a state poor even by Russia's standards is hard to fathom. The promised interview with him did not materialise: first, he was reported to be in Minsk and then in Sydney for the Olympics. There was more bad news to come when the director of the racecourse, himself a former steeplechase jockey (he rode in the 1986 Pardubice in Czechoslovakia), regretfully announced that my horse had not arrived. It was a bitter blow. I pleaded, cajoled, tried not to weep. Finally, he smiled, and agreed to let me ride his own horse, but warned that I should take care of it since it was not fit. I promised him that my hands were like silk, that his horse wouldn't even know that he'd been in a race. \"Yeah, yeah,\" his face said, \"I've heard all that before. Just take care of him.\" The evening wore on. Improbable deals were suggested by the men in the bar, chiefly involving the export of illegal caviar, while I was voted the Housewives' Choice on the dance floor. Decorum was impeccable, but they certainly enjoyed themselves. The great day dawned, cool and sullen. At the stables, horses were being groomed, tunics unpacked, fires being lit by the tents while the tethered sheep looked on in ovine ignorance. A stable groom gingerly led the way to the box of the racecourse director's horse. \"Be careful when you go in,\" said the groom. \"He bites.\" That sounded promising - a tiger of the steppes awaited me. The door swung open. There in the box stood a surly and malevolent grey, ears laid back, a veritable Boris of a horse, with thick shoulders and cojones you could play football with. There had clearly been a mistake; I turned to the groom, who had taken several steps backwards. Out of the corner of my eye I saw Boris swing his head towards me. Luckily, I got my elbow up into his teeth before he could get any purchase on flesh. He jerked his head back at the parry, but then stood back, content with this opening skirmish, like a boxer first tasting blood in his mouth and looking forward with relish to the fight ahead. You'll hear more of this, he seemed to be promising. Outside, horsemen were milling around the tents, while the camel disdainfully sat on a carpet - there was no doubt that he intended to eat it, and was trying to hide it. Bunting fluttered in the wind; children, dressed in outlandish costumes, ran back and forth. The churlish Boris was led out and saddled up, and then proffered by the groom, who was clearly curious as to what I would do next. I checked the girth; it was a move Boris resented and he quickly let me know. But once I was in the saddle he was solid beneath me, or possibly asleep. The saddle was comfortable, the leathers again a little short but easily adjusted (Boris resented this, too). Then we tried to take a few steps forward. Squatting in the shade of the stables, three young Kalmyk boys, each wearing a bandanna and tunic, watched with interest. Boris disappointed them. He proceeded agreeably in the right direction, stopped when I asked him, and sighed heavily, quite uninterested in the lean and fleet racehorses circling about us. On the course, the field was wheeling around, ready to canter in a parade in front of the stands before being led out on to the steppe for the start. In all, there were 54 horses competing. There were men with gnarled, weather-beaten faces, young boys and several women - half the field dressed in tunics, the rest in whatever clothes they probably woke up in, some with boots, some with gym shoes or sandals, many without saddles but all bearing a cloth with a number on. It was a circus sight, all of it lost on Boris, who had turned his head to sniff my foot a couple of times and was now thinking of other things. The field moved off at a trot, then a canter, then a gallop, with shouts and cries from riders and onlookers alike. Boris perked up; he was enjoying himself, and shouldered aside several in his path, even trying a playful buck. Unfortunately, he took away the back legs of a light bay on his nearside, which stumbled, throwing the young boy who was riding him bareback. I grabbed the back of the boy's shirt, heaved him back on, and was rewarded with a nervous smile - and this wasn't even the start. The stakes were high. The winner would receive the sensational prize of a Russian four-wheel drive; second, a fridge; the third would take home a horse as a trophy. I wondered if fourth place might garner me a hen. A two-mile walk still separated the field from the edge of the steppe and the start of the race. The riders around me chatted amicably enough, possibly about the price of sheep, until Boris kicked an innocent-looking gelding, which he clearly felt was encroaching on his path. I seized the moment, and hit him hard several times on his quarters in a tight turn. There were warning shouts from the other riders, which I took to mean that I should leave him alone. Actually, I had already been told that it was perilous even to show Boris a stick, let alone hit him with it. As it turned out, he was unruffled. If he felt the stick at all, he didn't begrudge it. I began to realise why he was so dear to the director's heart. At last we reached the plateau. At the front of the pack stood a ramshackle, moustachioed man barking instructions as if we were in the weighing room before the Grand National. The riders began to concentrate, muttering incantations to their horses. Then the tide swept forward and submerged the starter, gathered to a rush and charged. The game was on. To his credit, Boris proved to be a rock, but not much faster. He preferred a kind of sedentary, comfortable motion, covering the ground with dignity and a fearsome knee action. This was easy on the hands, even a pleasure, despite the dirt being thrown up in the headlong flight. We went on like this for a while, perhaps a mile or so, as small boys sped past us, cocked up like weasels over the mangy withers of their mounts, bouncing and smiling, with their coats and tunics flung out to the wind behind them. It was exhilarating, and I shouted out to a passing rider, just for the hell of it. He shouted back, but his words were blown away across the steppe. We were going a decent clip at this point, certainly as far as Boris was concerned. His locomotive powers were more diesel than high-octane. But already the field was thinning. Off to the right one horse careened away into the middle distance, before coming to ahalt, solitary and panting; the rider's silhouette was slumped forward, his legs dead and dangling. The image lasted no more than a moment as a horse checked and stumbled in front of us. Boris neatly changed legs and went past with a yard to spare, no doubt to accommodate his girth rather than my leg. This was going tidily enough. I seemed to have beneath me, if not pace, then at least resolution. We had settled into a good canter, two or three other competitors were within a hundred yards ahead of us, and the leaders blistering a dusty trail perhaps a furlong beyond. Most had fallen away; I was now in the company of riders with grim determination, their horses breathing regularly even as they skipped over a fault in the ground. They were fabulously agile and sure-footed. It had something of the feel of a good five-mile point across open country, except with another 30 miles to go. The cloud of dust kicked up by the leaders' group was beginning to disappear into the distance; I asked Boris to quicken a little in order to stay in touch. The response was immediate. Some truly terrible sounds began to emerge from beneath me, a kind of sobbing and heaving and gasping. It seemed Boris was coming to the end of his tether. He pulled himself up within a few yards, like a disabled half-back shuddering to a halt. I dismounted, loosened his girth and went up to the front end. It was a sorry sight. His head was down, his eyes rolling, like an exhausted clubman who has been asked to run for a bus rather than take his usual taxi. Oh God, I thought, what have I done? The whole thing was a charade, of course, a sort of Russian joke. When Boris had worked out that I was no longer on his back, he lifted his head, nudged me in the chest and looked around. We were alone, with nothing between us and the distant horizon. But then I saw, lying low in the landscape, the squat shape of the prison, which I knew was no more than a mile or two from the racecourse. We set off in that direction, the reins looped in my hand, Boris walking companionably beside me. Had a hawk seen us, hovering high in the huge sky, it might well have wondered what our purpose was. It seemed we had none. The solitariness of our situation heightened a kind of surreal camaraderie that I now felt for Boris. He might have been a Russian general, deserted by his men in a terrible battle, wandering in an empty no man's land but curiously content with his lot. I was touched. His feet kicked at the scrub, sewn with wild lavender, that sent up a heavenly smell. His ears were forward, his belly swung to his gait. I admit that I kissed him. He was surprised. By walking back directly to the prison we were cutting across a large segment of the full course, which formed a circle. After three-quarters of an hour of our idyll on the plains we found ourselves ahead of the field and just a mile and a half from the finish. At this last turn there was a hollow and a small grove of trees. It was a good place to lie low. Sooner than expected, the dust cloud appeared, far down the railway tracks. The shimmering figures of two, three, four, then five horsemen became clear. There was barely time to tighten Boris's girth - with more groans - and get on board before they were upon us. The five leaders came round the bend in a pack, still galloping, the horses soaked in sweat, their riders wild-eyed and pale. Boris reared up like a bear, wheeled round and set off in pursuit. There was a chance that we might make it to the finish with the pack. It was a forlorn hope. Even after a lazy walk, and his rivals exhausted after nearly 35 miles of galloping behind them, he couldn't keep up. As we reached the racecourse, there was just time to see, at the far end, two horses flash past the post, neck and neck. The third had careered off the track and was rudderless in the outfield, its rider helpless to steer any longer. Two onlookers grabbed the horse and dragged it over the line, where the rider fell to the ground almost unconscious. It was heroic. They carried the winning jockey from his horse, a good idea since he couldn't walk. He looked no more than a boy, but was, in fact, Vladimir Berukaev, an 18-year-old from the Ketchenerovsky region, 200 miles away. He was flung up on to the shoulders of his admirers and borne to his gleaming prize, the four-wheel-drive. Family and friends crammed in around him as he stroked the gear lever and fondled the steering wheel. Press cameras flashed in his exhausted and proud face. But not even his pride could conceal the fact that this was his first encounter with a driving seat. Back on the course, as a flurry of wind flung up the thin soil, Vladimir's horse was being walked around, his joints stiffening up but remarkably cool to the touch. Music blared out over a Tannoy system. The minister of culture, there to present prizes, was jostled aside by the press of onlookers. The few sheep still around began to look nervous. Only the camel was unconcerned. He'd seen it all before. At seven the following morning, the racecourse was empty, but still it had the feeling of an arena that had seen great glory. The tents had gone, and weeds and rubbish covered the infield where they had been. Over in the stables stood the winning horse, cool, disinterested. The truck to take him home arrived, its driver falling out of the cab in a stupor. Boris was in much the same condition as when I first met him. I bent down to feel his legs - they were cool and hard. He smelled my back, thought about biting out my backbone, but instead neatly, and kindly, kneed me in the balls.",

In the public's eye, the profession's sole remit is to sprinkle the landscape with airport terminals and millennium bridges.

Small projects, in this case, are defined as any scheme with a contract value of less than \u00a3150,000. This year's shortlist of 24 residential projects included a \"glass cube\" conservatory, a refurbished 60s terraced house, a reclaimed basement and a converted grain barge. The smallest project was Eco-Logic's roof terrace and timber conservatory, valued at \u00a335,000. If you think that's a bit steep for a glorified garden shed, then you should know that the price doesn't include the architects' fees. For that you pay an extra 8% to 15% of the contract value. \"Building work does cost a lot,\" admits Elspeth Clements, chair of the Small Practice Committee, set up by the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) to help promote its services to the ordinary householder. Persuading the British public to invest in architecture, she says, is an uphill struggle. \"People tend to think that if you want an extension or something done to a listed house, you go to a surveyor,\" she says. Then there's the more recent Changing Rooms factor, which has been powerful in encouraging the quick-fix, do-it-yourself craze. Plus there is an emerging stable of \"plan drawers\", who will knock out a design without managing the project, at a fraction of the cost of an architect.</p> <p>In an ideal world, what people should demand from an architect is quality design and innovative ideas. And, as any of them will tell you, you get what you pay for.</p> <p><b>The extension</b></p> <p>Cost: \u00a365,000 Imaginative extensions are among the mainstays of small-project work, the classic of the genre being the architects' modernist glass box. There are numerous variations on this theme, but the judges chose to praise architect Paul Archer's 'English-Asian' brick extension, built on to the back of Naeem Ahmed's house, in Wimbledon, southwest London.</p> <p>Archer and Ahmed already had a long-term relationship through the architect's work on Ahmed's language school in central London. The fusion of English and Asian domestic architecture came about through a shared interest in Indian culture (one by birth; the other by experience). The brief was to add an inside-outside space, to link the living room, kitchen and garden of a brick-built 50s house. The solution is a hybrid of English conservatory and Indian veranda, built in the same brick as the house. An integrated series of folding screens allows flexible use of space, and even provides the means 'to put the kitchen away' during family gatherings. A perforated brick wall (a traditional Indian method of diffusing light) casts attractive squares of sunlight across the floor. The bill of \u00a365,000 (including a remodelled kitchen) was a little more than Ahmed had planned to pay, but he is delighted with the result. And like most intelligent extensions, it will probably add an equivalent figure to the value of the house.</p> <p><b>The conversion</b></p> <p>Cost: \u00a385,000 When the artist-illustrator, Mike Wilks (author of bestselling picture book, The Ultimate Alphabet), first saw his house two years ago, it was impossible to imagine living there. Taking up the two lower floors of a large Victorian pub in south London, the place consisted of a redundant public bar at ground level and a dank cellar below.</p> <p>The floors, says Wilks, were in a terrible state and, despite the support of original cast-iron columns, they appeared to be 'held up by magic'. Partially blocked windows deprived the rooms of light, and the cellar was windowless. The property, however, was affordable (\u00a3140,000); plus it had loads of space (2,750 sq ft). So Wilks took a risk and, with an initial budget of \u00a360,000, employed architects Timpson Manley to turn the seedy Surrey Arms into a cool live-work space, with a studio-cum-library in the bar and a one-bed living area below.</p> <p>The property still looks like a pub from the outside, but one step beyond the entrance hall (once occupied by the gents' loos) and there's a sea of clean, white space, split into two ship-like decks linked by a spiral staircase. But the process was not, says Wilks, without heartache and extra expense. The final bill came to \u00a385,000 (plus an extra 14% in fees, plus VAT). How was the money spent? On the vast acreage of beech flooring, perhaps? Er, no, that was added later. The nature of conversion (as opposed to a fresh construction job) does make it harder to see exactly what the architect has provided; and in this case, much of the project was about dealing with planning issues, building regulations, structural walls and installing concealed heating, ventilation, and wiring for stereo and computer systems. The architects also had to find a way of bringing light into the basement. They did it by building a mezzanine floor.</p> <p>The heartache came 'when a builder came on board and started costing for real, the sums turned out to be pure fantasy', says Wilks. Disappointing compromises had to be made (such as giving up a bespoke staircase for an off-the-peg equivalent) but, overall, Wilks thought the architects provided the essential combination of 'a good grip on planning issues and good design'. Initially, Wilks did think the price was too expensive - until he had the property valued at \u00a3550,000.</p> <p><b>The new house</b></p> <p>Cost: \u00a3135,000 Opportunities to construct an innovative contemporary house for less than a bog-standard, off-the-peg self-build are few and far between, but London clients, David Mogford and Sue Taylor, managed to commission and build one for \u00a3135,000. And that included everything. Erm, everything except architects' fees, taxes and the cost of buying the land.</p> <p>The couple are reluctant to discuss prices for the latter, except to say that a similar site would have cost a lot less outside London. This one included a single-storey garage, which was duly dispensed with, leaving a deep but inauspiciously narrow 'urban infill' site between two industrial buildings.</p> <p>The challenge was to slip a new domestic building into this awkward space. But the first hurdle, says Mogford, was to find a sympathetic architect. 'In three or four cases, just getting to talk to these people was like trying to get an interview with a member of the House of Lords,' he recalls. In other cases, he was fobbed off with a snooty rebuttal of his meagre funds.</p> <p>Then the couple met Jonathan Dransfield of Dransfield Owen de Silva. They found him enthusiastic and approachable, but he also offered inventive ideas about how to keep their costs down. In essence, what they got for the money was five staggered levels of open, warehousey living space suspended between two existing party walls, a front elevation in yellow stock brick, a light-well to the rear (essential, as the house backs on to another building), cedar-shingle roof and the services of a structural engineer (who collaborated on the design of an ingenious central staircase, housed in a cylinder of wooden plywood and suspended on tensioned chains).</p> <p>In Mogford's opinion, the value of employing an architect was for the management of the project and for sourcing of skills and materials. The cost of brickwork, for example, was reduced by using over-fired, kiln misshapes (which have better texture); wiring was tucked into wall-mounted plastic conduits, painted with metallic-grey Hammerite. As an alternative to skirting boards, they used hemp rope. 'We also used small craftsmen, in every instance, including the kitchen fit-out,' says Mogford.

      "body": "<p>He doesn't look much like a revolutionary, this man in grey trousers and white shirt. His pace is relaxed, his expression unassuming as he walks down the aisle towards the stage. But already the crowd, jammed into the hard-backed seats of this school auditorium, is cheering enthusiastically. Three hundred people with learning difficulties have gathered here on a muggy Saturday afternoon to participate in Express 2000, a series of discussion groups and art workshops. Later in the day, they will disperse into the classrooms of Hinchingbrooke School in Huntingdon to learn modern dance, design banners, juggle, and to discuss womanhood and sexuality. But at the moment they are enjoying the opening ceremony, which includes a mock chat show in which Andrew Lee, the grey-trousered man, is the final guest.</p> <p>Lee is not here to talk about dance or juggling. He's here to talk politics. He is introduced to the audience as \"a man who has learning difficulties and has made his life work\". And with the conviction of an evangelist among the hopefuls, he turns the chatshow into an opportunity for a proselytising speech. He uses neither the dramatic gestures of a politician on the stump, nor the musical intonations of a Baptist preacher on a Sunday morning. He stumbles over his words. But it doesn't matter. Nearly every sentence is followed by a burst of applause.</p> <p>\"When it comes down to it, the only professionals who are fit to talk about what it's like to have learning difficulties are people with learning difficulties.\" The audience cheers.</p> <p>\"If something bad is happening in your life, then you need to stand up and change that.\" More claps and shouts.</p> <p>\"What's your message for people here today?\" asks one of his interviewers.</p> <p>\"If you're not part of a self-advocacy organisation, join it. If every person with a learning difficulty across the country was part of a self-advocacy group, then that would send a message to social service professionals who think they know it all.\"</p> <p>Lee may not look like much of a threat, but he is armed with an idea that is upending the way people understand the learning disabled. The idea is called self-advocacy. The principle behind self-advocacy is simple: people with learning difficulties should be able to advocate for their own needs, rather than having their needs represented by others - parents, social workers, teachers, doctors.</p> <p>Lee is director of a self-advocacy group in London called People First, one of hundreds around the country that are run by people with learning difficulties. As Kate Eldon, chairperson of Bristol People First, put it, \"It's a way of people with learning difficulties getting a voice and getting their ideas across. It means they can tell people what they want and make decisions for themselves.\"</p> <p>This simple idea has become the driving force behind a movement that is changing the lives of people with learning difficulties across Britain and throughout the world. Straightforward as it seems, it is a radical notion in societies that have always assumed that people with learning difficulties by definition cannot really think or speak for themselves.</p> <p>The self-advocacy movement in Britain has spent the past 20 years hammering away at that attitude. Today, people who would once have been called retards, mentally-deficient, spastic are running their own organisations, helping social workers assess health, leisure and residential services, campaigning for increased independence, sitting on government advisory committees.</p> <p>But, more important, the movement is convincing people with learning difficulties that, no matter what they have been told, they are capable of taking charge of their own lives. \"When I was born, my parents were told by medical professionals that</p> <p>I wouldn't walk, I wouldn't talk and the best thing they could do for me was stick me in an institution,\" Lee says after his speech. \"I'd like to meet those doctors now.\"</p> <p>The organisations that Lee and Eldon direct can trace their ancestry back to a residential home in Oregon in 1974. A group of people with learning difficulties had just returned from a conference in Canada that was supposed to be a forum for the disabled to air their grievances. But they were disappointed to find that even that conference was run by social service professionals. So they created an organisation they could run themselves. While they were arguing about a name, someone at the back of the room shouted, \"We are people first!\" Thus the first People First was born.</p> <p>It was an approach that was in sync with the political rhythms of the time. A decade earlier, African-Americans were marching on Washington, registering voters in the South, organising the Black Panther party. Feminists were creating the National Organisation of Women, filing suits over sex discrimination, protesting against the Miss America beauty contest.</p> <p>At the time, people with learning difficulties were facing bigotry and prejudice as potent as racism and sexism. In Britain, most lived either in hospitals or with their families. Hospitals were large, isolated institutions, tucked between farms or scattered along the fringes of cities, where disabled people were hidden from the rest of society. Overcrowded wards made privacy a scarce commodity. People shared rooms, occasionally even clothes and toothbrushes. Some people were committed as children and lived in such places their entire lives.</p> <p>Even people who lived with their families were often sequestered from the community. Jan Walmsley, senior lecturer in learning disability with the Open University, tells the story of a social worker who visited the house of an elderly woman who had recently died and discovered the woman's 50-year-old disabled daughter living in the house. No one, not even the neighbours, knew she existed.</p> <p>The People First concept radiated out from Oregon, gaining momentum as it encountered parallel developments in other parts of the world. In the early 80s, the tides of this new movement washed up on to the shores of Britain. But as people with learning difficulties began to organise, they quickly discovered that some of the fiercest resistance came from people who were supposed to be on their side - namely, social workers, doctors, even their own parents. \"I'd been used to being dictated to by a lot of people, service professionals, the lot,\" says Ian Davies, treasurer of Northamptonshire People First, who has been involved with the movement since 1990. \"They dominated people's lives and had done for a long time. They didn't accept what we were trying to do. They didn't believe for one moment that we were going to set up our own group.\"</p> <p>Take Craig Hart, for example. Until last May, he lived in a group home in Northamptonshire. He was not allowed to have a key to the front door. He had an 11pm curfew. He had no direct access to his government benefit money. When he asked if he could buy a mobile phone, the staff wouldn't let him use his own money to do it. He knew that this was not how a 30-year-old was supposed to live. When he finally decided to move out, he was told that it was too big a risk. \"Well, whose life is it? Yours or mine?\" he asked, and left anyway. Now Hart is vice-chair of Northamptonshire People First.</p> <p>Or Michael Edwards, co-chair of the self-advocacy group My Life My Choice. For 20 years, he spent his days at a centre in Oxfordshire where people with learning difficulties sorted plastic components for things such as bicycle handles and bottle tops, work he found mind-numbingly dull. \"I had an occasion where we finished early and at lunchtime they mixed it all up and made us do it again,\" said Edwards, 47. He finally quit when the centre started charging members \u00a31 per day to attend, thereby essentially asking him to pay to be bored.</p> <p>From its cluttered Kentish Town offices, People First in London, the organisation of which Lee is the director, is juggling a long list of campaigns. They are registering disabled people to vote and demanding that the voting process be made more accessible.

In December, People First went to Nice for the European Council summit to present a series of measures it would like to see added to the human rights charter.</p> <p>The group has the ear of the Labour government, at least indirectly. One People First member is on the advisory group for the government's National Learning Disability Strategy. Another activist is on the Disability Rights Commission (DRC). \"It shows people with learning difficulties that we can be involved in the decisions that get made about our lives,\" says Eve Rank-Petruzziello, the only DRC member with a learning difficulty. \"There can be no more excuses about not involving us in the issues which affect us.\"</p> <p>But the London office is hardly typical of the 300 or so self-advocacy groups scattered around Britain. Most struggle with far more mundane tasks, such as paying the bills,making sure that all their members, many of whom cannot drive and have difficulty with public transportation, can get to meetings. Although many share the People First name, most operate independently, and they don't always get along. A few attempts have been made to bring the groups together into a national coalition, but each has succumbed to internal bickering. And the movement has yet to convince the general public, including major funders, that people with learning difficulties are capable of leading and managing sizeable organisations.

Is it simply yet another sign of society's unwillingness to broaden its notion of what the learning disabled can achieve, or is it rather a sign of an inherent weakness of the movement? To put it more baldly, does the nature of the disability place inevitable limits on what those whom it affects can achieve? \"Fifty years from now, people will either look back on this as a time when the pendulum swung too far and people had ridiculous hopes and expectations,\" says Walmsley, \"or they will look back on it and say, 'How could they have been so limited in their thinking?' \"</p> <p>Sitting in the centre of the front row of the council chambers at Camden Town hall one day last year was John Atkinson. Atkinson had an unusual lifestyle compared with most people with learning difficulties. By the age of 34, he had a wife, a six-year-old son and a house. As basic as those things sound, for people with learning difficulties they are rare and highly prized commodities. For Atkinson, each one entailed a battle against public perception. Volunteers at the leisure centre where he and his wife spent time placed wagers on whether his marriage would last, he said. Social services put a care order on his son before he was born, so that they could take the baby away at the first sign of trouble.</p> <p>He was in London that day because he had been elected to represent the Darlington area on Mencap's National Assembly. Sadly, since then John Atkinson has died - but he lived long enough to see some of the things he worked for come to fruition.</p> <p>Three years ago, Britain's oldest and largest learning disabled charity tore up its old constitution, which put most power in the hands of the parents, and began the complex task of writing a new one. The culmination of that effort is the National Assembly, a membership-elected governing body that convened its first full meeting in Camden's council chambers, which had been donated as a venue. The constitution requires that at least one-third of the elected members must have learning difficulties. Not long after the meeting started, Atkinson suggested that an audio version of the board of trustees' report should be made available for people who were seeing impaired.</p> <p>Behind Atkinson was Thomas Menear, who was elected from Cornwall and whose 45-year-old son has Down's syndrome. Menear is 73 and has been a member of Mencap for 35 years. You need look no further than his first name to work out his attitude to Mencap's constitutional changes. \"My first name is Thomas,\" he says. \"And, remember, in the Bible Thomas was a doubter.\" The problem with self-advocacy, he argues, is that sometimes it caters to the interests of those with milder disabilities, who usually occupy leadership positions, and ignore the needs of those with more severe disabilities. (Lee and Rank-Petruzziello have disabilities so mild they are not apparent on first meeting them.)</p> <p>\"What you see in London at the National Assembly, it's not true to life,\" adds Menear. \"The aspirations are marvellous, but most of it can't be achieved except by a very small number of people.\" During the meeting, he complained that a report they had been given was oversimplified.</p> <p>Both Atkinson's and Menear's comments bring the challenges facing Mencap's new assembly sharply into focus - one was concerned that the materials are not accessible enough for people with learning disabilities; the other was concerned they are not informative enough for people without suchdisabilities. It is the job of Fred Heddell, chief executive of Mencap, to turn a group of people with both viewpoints into a functioning governing body. The charity now accepts the idea that people with learning difficulties should have more power in the organisation, but two questions still remain - how, and how much?</p> <p>The \"how?\" part is relatively easy to answer. The representatives arrive at the meeting carrying materials that they hope will allow people with disabilities and people without to work on an equal footing. As they settle into their seats in the chamber, they pull out multicoloured agenda sheets printed with large fonts and helpful illustrations. Each member has red, green, yellow and white \"traffic light\" cards. If a member wants to vote against a motion or to stop the meeting because she doesn't understand something, she holds up the red card. If the meeting is moving too fast, she holds up the yellow card to slow it down. Green is to vote for a motion. White is to ask a question.</p> <p>The trickier question, however, is \"how much?\". Mencap was launched in 1946 by a group of parents whose children had learning difficulties. Since then, its parent members have led the charge for better education, better services, more leisure and vocational activities, better housing, and some of those parents now feel that, after all their years of hard work, they are being shoved aside in an organisation they created.</p> <p>Heddell crosses his arms across his chest. He's sitting in an office that he is using temporarily while Mencap's headquarters, just a stone's throw from the City of London, are being refurbished. He feels confident that, together, people with learning difficulties and their parents will represent a more powerful force than they do separately. \"I think the great danger is to focus too heavily on the differences and not recognise that, in fact, in terms of the service, the provision, the support and things that people with learning disability need, the vast majority is in common with all of the other stakeholders and vested interests in the area. That gives us in terms of, say, our campaigning role much better leverage.\"</p> <p>It's a position that Atkinson supported. \"I think people with learning difficulties are getting a fair crack of the whip,\" he said. The learning disabled \"learn from those who have been in the job the longest. The new people with the learning difficulties who are coming in, they're showing [the non-disabled] how to do things so that people can understand it. It's a learning thing for both of us.\"</p> <p>But the desire to incorporate both the disabled and non-disabled leaves Mencap with an intractable dilemma. The structure of the charity, whose mission statement says it aims to be \"the principal pressure group for people with a learning disability\", would be absurd if applied to any similar organisation. Most social movements hold as a core belief the idea that people who are the target of discrimination have to be in control of the efforts to fight it. Otherwise, you are left with an impossible situation in which the oppressor is both doling out the injustice and dictating the terms on which it is fought. So, parents may have a personal connection to disability, but, ultimately, they rank among the oppressor class - that is, the non- disabled. Imagine if two-thirds of the control of the Scottish National Party was in the hands of the English. Or if Stonewall was two-thirds run by parents of gays and lesbians.</p> <p>But Heddell makes clear that Mencap has no intention of becoming a self-advocacy group. \"Let's start from the beginning,\" he says. \"Intellectual disability is intellectual disability. And the more complex and so on issues become, the more you're going to need other people to do it. Animal welfare groups are not run by animals. Now I don't want to create any kind of parallel with people with learning disability. Children's groups are not run by children. Perhaps that's a better example.\"</p> <p>Even People First can't entirely escape a dependence on the non-disabled. In movement lingo, they are called \"supporters\". Their job is to help people with disabilities, many of whom have been told all their lives they are incapable of making up their own minds, determining what they want and how they can get it. Their tasks can range from writing letters to translating official documents into plain English, to explaining legal and political strategy, to chauffeuring disabled people around.</p> <p>\"The supporter is so important,\" explains Walmsley. \"The supporter has to be somebody who allows people to make mistakes and not be on a power trip. They're seen as wheelchairs or sign-language interpreters, but they're not because they perform a much more complex task.\"</p> <p>For a self-advocacy group to succeed, good support is critical. But there are no national networks, no standardised training, no regulations for supporters. Although some are paid staff, many are volunteers. The uneven quality of support available is one of the movement's greatest vulnerabilities. \"I see it at times as a very difficult role, because it's very easy to allow yourself to be influencing heavily the decisions they reach,\" says Chris Lock, a supporter and trustee with the self-advocacy group, My Life My Choice. \"The watchword is to listen carefully to what they are saying and to act on it, rather than acting on your own decisions, even if you disagree with them. That's the hardest of all.\"</p> <p>But the line between drawing ideas from people and telling them what to think is thin and hard to locate. Take a glance at the work of a group of people with learning difficulties in Croydon that the NHS has recruited to assess the quality of its residential services, and you'll see an impressive effort by people who have spent months interviewing residents and tallying their findings. Then look again, this time more closely, at a meeting with the group and the programme co-ordinators from the NHS: in one corner you will see a non-disabled woman, one of the co-ordinators, lean over to whisper to a disabled man who has just suggested that staff in these homes should do a better job of asking residents what they want.</p> <p>\"Do you think that people [with disabilities] should learn to ask for themselves?\" she says.</p> <p>\"Yeah,\" he responds.</p> <p>\"Good point. Say that then.\"</p> <p>When he is called on to speak, she has to talk him through it. \"Should people . . .\" she coaxes.</p> <p>\"People.\"</p> <p>\"Ask . . .\"</p> <p>\"Ask.\"</p> <p>\"For themselves?\"</p> <p>\"For themselves?\"</p> <p>Lock says that, sometimes, he has no choice but to take charge in this way. With only a few supporters for 11 disabled trustees, they simply do not have the resources to help each person keep up with everything. For example, two members sign the cheques. Lock would like them to have a better understanding of how the budget works, but they would need individual support to do that. \"Sometimes it's necessary to make decisions because there isn't time to check and go back and listen,\" he says.</p> <p>The weakness of groups run entirely by people with learning difficulties, argues Craig Dearden, project manager of Speaking Up!, the organisation that hosted Express 2000, is that they are attaching more importance to the process than the outcome. For this reason, Speaking Up! describes itself as an advocacy group, not a self-advocacy group, to acknowledge the fact that, although most of its leaders have learning difficulties, some do not. \"We believe that a partnership between people with and without learning difficulties is far more effective than a situation in which people with learning difficulties are left to do everything on their own,\" says Dearden, who is not learning disabled. \"In my experience, those types of organisations often struggle to deliver, and hit problems in the medium and long term . . . I think that is an incredibly slow approach in a competitive charity environment.\"</p> <p>But what if the problem isn't that people with learning difficulties move too slowly? What if the problem is that people without learning difficulties assume that there is value in moving quickly? If the achievements of the self-advocacy movement do not appear to measure up to those of other social move-ments, perhaps all we need to do is change the yardstick by which we measure its success.</p> <p>During the lunch break of Express 2000, a middle-aged man with round, plastic glasses and a jacket over his arm approaches Lee and introduces himself. His name is John. Immediately, Lee is back in evangelist mode. He begins telling John about some of People First's political goals: \"What we'd like to see is, when people are interviewed for jobs to work in residential care, people with learning difficulties are on the panels.\"</p> <p>John, it turns out, is very agreeable. He says little, nods a lot and, when Lee pauses, replies simply, \"That's nice.\" He wanders off again and it's not clear that he's understood anything Lee has just said. Lee recognises that bringing people such as John on board will be a slow process. \"There is nothing wrong with an organisation going at the speed that people with learning difficulties want it to,\" he says. \"If an organisation is not controlled by people with learning difficulties, then it is bound to go too quickly for them. And then how can they make an informed decision about what the organisation is achieving?\"</p> <p>So you change the yardstick: rather than viewing Lee's conversation with John as a failure, see it as a tiny step in a very long, very gradual, but very vital process. And, as far as Lee is concerned, there is no debate to be had over whether people with learning difficulties can lead a movement; there are no paradoxes, no contradictions and confusions. It may take time, he says, but we are slowly, inexorably headed for a different future.</p> <p>Walmsley provides her own answer to the question she posed earlier - whether in 50 years' time people will look back and say we went too far or not far enough. \"I think we will get further. I'm sure we will get further than we are now. I suppose 50 years from now, we'll be saying that they were very naive, that they could have done this better.\"</p> <p>In 50 years' time, self advocates imagine a world in which people with learning difficulties live independently, earn money, get married, have children. A world in which they are free from harassment and abuse. They can see a future in which People First will be Britain's \"principal pressure group for people with a learning disability\". When the government's minister for disabled people will have learning difficulties.</p> <p>They imagine a day when we will look back at this time and see not a movement that had reached its zenith, but a movement that had only just begun.</p>",

      "bodyText": "He doesn't look much like a revolutionary, this man in grey trousers and white shirt. His pace is relaxed, his expression unassuming as he walks down the aisle towards the stage. But already the crowd, jammed into the hard-backed seats of this school auditorium, is cheering enthusiastically. Three hundred people with learning difficulties have gathered here on a muggy Saturday afternoon to participate in Express 2000, a series of discussion groups and art workshops. Later in the day, they will disperse into the classrooms of Hinchingbrooke School in Huntingdon to learn modern dance, design banners, juggle, and to discuss womanhood and sexuality. But at the moment they are enjoying the opening ceremony, which includes a mock chat show in which Andrew Lee, the grey-trousered man, is the final guest. Lee is not here to talk about dance or juggling. He's here to talk politics. He is introduced to the audience as \"a man who has learning difficulties and has made his life work\". And with the conviction of an evangelist among the hopefuls, he turns the chatshow into an opportunity for a proselytising speech. He uses neither the dramatic gestures of a politician on the stump, nor the musical intonations of a Baptist preacher on a Sunday morning. He stumbles over his words. But it doesn't matter. Nearly every sentence is followed by a burst of applause. \"When it comes down to it, the only professionals who are fit to talk about what it's like to have learning difficulties are people with learning difficulties.\" The audience cheers. \"If something bad is happening in your life, then you need to stand up and change that.\" More claps and shouts. \"What's your message for people here today?\" asks one of his interviewers. \"If you're not part of a self-advocacy organisation, join it. If every person with a learning difficulty across the country was part of a self-advocacy group, then that would send a message to social service professionals who think they know it all.\" Lee may not look like much of a threat, but he is armed with an idea that is upending the way people understand the learning disabled. The idea is called self-advocacy. The principle behind self-advocacy is simple: people with learning difficulties should be able to advocate for their own needs, rather than having their needs represented by others - parents, social workers, teachers, doctors. Lee is director of a self-advocacy group in London called People First, one of hundreds around the country that are run by people with learning difficulties. As Kate Eldon, chairperson of Bristol People First, put it, \"It's a way of people with learning difficulties getting a voice and getting their ideas across. It means they can tell people what they want and make decisions for themselves.\" This simple idea has become the driving force behind a movement that is changing the lives of people with learning difficulties across Britain and throughout the world. Straightforward as it seems, it is a radical notion in societies that have always assumed that people with learning difficulties by definition cannot really think or speak for themselves. The self-advocacy movement in Britain has spent the past 20 years hammering away at that attitude. Today, people who would once have been called retards, mentally-deficient, spastic are running their own organisations, helping social workers assess health, leisure and residential services, campaigning for increased independence, sitting on government advisory committees. But, more important, the movement is convincing people with learning difficulties that, no matter what they have been told, they are capable of taking charge of their own lives. \"When I was born, my parents were told by medical professionals that I wouldn't walk, I wouldn't talk and the best thing they could do for me was stick me in an institution,\" Lee says after his speech. \"I'd like to meet those doctors now.\" The organisations that Lee and Eldon direct can trace their ancestry back to a residential home in Oregon in 1974. A group of people with learning difficulties had just returned from a conference in Canada that was supposed to be a forum for the disabled to air their grievances. But they were disappointed to find that even that conference was run by social service professionals. So they created an organisation they could run themselves. While they were arguing about a name, someone at the back of the room shouted, \"We are people first!\" Thus the first People First was born. It was an approach that was in sync with the political rhythms of the time. A decade earlier, African-Americans were marching on Washington, registering voters in the South, organising the Black Panther party. Feminists were creating the National Organisation of Women, filing suits over sex discrimination, protesting against the Miss America beauty contest. At the time, people with learning difficulties were facing bigotry and prejudice as potent as racism and sexism. In Britain, most lived either in hospitals or with their families. Hospitals were large, isolated institutions, tucked between farms or scattered along the fringes of cities, where disabled people were hidden from the rest of society. Overcrowded wards made privacy a scarce commodity. People shared rooms, occasionally even clothes and toothbrushes. Some people were committed as children and lived in such places their entire lives. Even people who lived with their families were often sequestered from the community. Jan Walmsley, senior lecturer in learning disability with the Open University, tells the story of a social worker who visited the house of an elderly woman who had recently died and discovered the woman's 50-year-old disabled daughter living in the house. No one, not even the neighbours, knew she existed. The People First concept radiated out from Oregon, gaining momentum as it encountered parallel developments in other parts of the world. In the early 80s, the tides of this new movement washed up on to the shores of Britain. But as people with learning difficulties began to organise, they quickly discovered that some of the fiercest resistance came from people who were supposed to be on their side - namely, social workers, doctors, even their own parents. \"I'd been used to being dictated to by a lot of people, service professionals, the lot,\" says Ian Davies, treasurer of Northamptonshire People First, who has been involved with the movement since 1990. \"They dominated people's lives and had done for a long time. They didn't accept what we were trying to do. They didn't believe for one moment that we were going to set up our own group.\" Take Craig Hart, for example. Until last May, he lived in a group home in Northamptonshire. He was not allowed to have a key to the front door. He had an 11pm curfew. He had no direct access to his government benefit money. When he asked if he could buy a mobile phone, the staff wouldn't let him use his own money to do it. He knew that this was not how a 30-year-old was supposed to live. When he finally decided to move out, he was told that it was too big a risk. \"Well, whose life is it? Yours or mine?\" he asked, and left anyway. Now Hart is vice-chair of Northamptonshire People First. Or Michael Edwards, co-chair of the self-advocacy group My Life My Choice. For 20 years, he spent his days at a centre in Oxfordshire where people with learning difficulties sorted plastic components for things such as bicycle handles and bottle tops, work he found mind-numbingly dull. \"I had an occasion where we finished early and at lunchtime they mixed it all up and made us do it again,\" said Edwards, 47. He finally quit when the centre started charging members \u00a31 per day to attend, thereby essentially asking him to pay to be bored. From its cluttered Kentish Town offices, People First in London, the organisation of which Lee is the director, is juggling a long list of campaigns. They are registering disabled people to vote and demanding that the voting process be made more accessible. They are protesting about a piece of legislation that, they feel, would give parents and carers too much control over their lives. In December, People First went to Nice for the European Council summit to present a series of measures it would like to see added to the human rights charter. The group has the ear of the Labour government, at least indirectly. One People First member is on the advisory group for the government's National Learning Disability Strategy. Another activist is on the Disability Rights Commission (DRC). \"It shows people with learning difficulties that we can be involved in the decisions that get made about our lives,\" says Eve Rank-Petruzziello, the only DRC member with a learning difficulty. \"There can be no more excuses about not involving us in the issues which affect us.\" But the London office is hardly typical of the 300 or so self-advocacy groups scattered around Britain. Most struggle with far more mundane tasks, such as paying the bills,making sure that all their members, many of whom cannot drive and have difficulty with public transportation, can get to meetings. Although many share the People First name, most operate independently, and they don't always get along. A few attempts have been made to bring the groups together into a national coalition, but each has succumbed to internal bickering. And the movement has yet to convince the general public, including major funders, that people with learning difficulties are capable of leading and managing sizeable organisations. Stack up their budgets next to that of, say, Mencap, the country's largest learning disability charity, which last year spent just over \u00a3100m, and even the wealthiest of Britain's People First groups are paupers in comparison. And while its brethren movements of the 60s and 70s stepped into the international spotlight long ago, self-advocacy has remained in obscurity, a continued low profile that raises questions about its long-term potential. Is it simply yet another sign of society's unwillingness to broaden its notion of what the learning disabled can achieve, or is it rather a sign of an inherent weakness of the movement? To put it more baldly, does the nature of the disability place inevitable limits on what those whom it affects can achieve? \"Fifty years from now, people will either look back on this as a time when the pendulum swung too far and people had ridiculous hopes and expectations,\" says Walmsley, \"or they will look back on it and say, 'How could they have been so limited in their thinking?' \" Sitting in the centre of the front row of the council chambers at Camden Town hall one day last year was John Atkinson. Atkinson had an unusual lifestyle compared with most people with learning difficulties. By the age of 34, he had a wife, a six-year-old son and a house. As basic as those things sound, for people with learning difficulties they are rare and highly prized commodities. For Atkinson, each one entailed a battle against public perception. Volunteers at the leisure centre where he and his wife spent time placed wagers on whether his marriage would last, he said. Social services put a care order on his son before he was born, so that they could take the baby away at the first sign of trouble. He was in London that day because he had been elected to represent the Darlington area on Mencap's National Assembly. Sadly, since then John Atkinson has died - but he lived long enough to see some of the things he worked for come to fruition. Three years ago, Britain's oldest and largest learning disabled charity tore up its old constitution, which put most power in the hands of the parents, and began the complex task of writing a new one. The culmination of that effort is the National Assembly, a membership-elected governing body that convened its first full meeting in Camden's council chambers, which had been donated as a venue. The constitution requires that at least one-third of the elected members must have learning difficulties. Not long after the meeting started, Atkinson suggested that an audio version of the board of trustees' report should be made available for people who were seeing impaired.

Both Atkinson's and Menear's comments bring the challenges facing Mencap's new assembly sharply into focus - one was concerned that the materials are not accessible enough for people with learning disabilities; the other was concerned they are not informative enough for people without suchdisabilities. It is the job of Fred Heddell, chief executive of Mencap, to turn a group of people with both viewpoints into a functioning governing body. The charity now accepts the idea that people with learning difficulties should have more power in the organisation, but two questions still remain - how, and how much? The \"how?\" part is relatively easy to answer.

The uneven quality of support available is one of the movement's greatest vulnerabilities. \"I see it at times as a very difficult role, because it's very easy to allow yourself to be influencing heavily the decisions they reach,\" says Chris Lock, a supporter and trustee with the self-advocacy group, My Life My Choice. \"The watchword is to listen carefully to what they are saying and to act on it, rather than acting on your own decisions, even if you disagree with them. That's the hardest of all.\" But the line between drawing ideas from people and telling them what to think is thin and hard to locate. Take a glance at the work of a group of people with learning difficulties in Croydon that the NHS has recruited to assess the quality of its residential services, and you'll see an impressive effort by people who have spent months interviewing residents and tallying their findings. Then look again, this time more closely, at a meeting with the group and the programme co-ordinators from the NHS: in one corner you will see a non-disabled woman, one of the co-ordinators, lean over to whisper to a disabled man who has just suggested that staff in these homes should do a better job of asking residents what they want. \"Do you think that people [with disabilities] should learn to ask for themselves?\" she says. \"Yeah,\" he responds. \"Good point. Say that then.\" When he is called on to speak, she has to talk him through it. \"Should people . . .\" she coaxes. \"People.\" \"Ask . . .\" \"Ask.\" \"For themselves?\" \"For themselves?\" Lock says that, sometimes, he has no choice but to take charge in this way. With only a few supporters for 11 disabled trustees, they simply do not have the resources to help each person keep up with everything. For example, two members sign the cheques. Lock would like them to have a better understanding of how the budget works, but they would need individual support to do that. \"Sometimes it's necessary to make decisions because there isn't time to check and go back and listen,\" he says. The weakness of groups run entirely by people with learning difficulties, argues Craig Dearden, project manager of Speaking Up!, the organisation that hosted Express 2000, is that they are attaching more importance to the process than the outcome. For this reason, Speaking Up! describes itself as an advocacy group, not a self-advocacy group, to acknowledge the fact that, although most of its leaders have learning difficulties, some do not. \"We believe that a partnership between people with and without learning difficulties is far more effective than a situation in which people with learning difficulties are left to do everything on their own,\" says Dearden, who is not learning disabled. \"In my experience, those types of organisations often struggle to deliver, and hit problems in the medium and long term . . . I think that is an incredibly slow approach in a competitive charity environment.\" But what if the problem isn't that people with learning difficulties move too slowly? What if the problem is that people without learning difficulties assume that there is value in moving quickly? If the achievements of the self-advocacy movement do not appear to measure up to those of other social move-ments, perhaps all we need to do is change the yardstick by which we measure its success. During the lunch break of Express 2000, a middle-aged man with round, plastic glasses and a jacket over his arm approaches Lee and introduces himself. His name is John. Immediately, Lee is back in evangelist mode. He begins telling John about some of People First's political goals: \"What we'd like to see is, when people are interviewed for jobs to work in residential care, people with learning difficulties are on the panels.\" John, it turns out, is very agreeable. He says little, nods a lot and, when Lee pauses, replies simply, \"That's nice.\" He wanders off again and it's not clear that he's understood anything Lee has just said. Lee recognises that bringing people such as John on board will be a slow process. \"There is nothing wrong with an organisation going at the speed that people with learning difficulties want it to,\" he says. \"If an organisation is not controlled by people with learning difficulties, then it is bound to go too quickly for them. And then how can they make an informed decision about what the organisation is achieving?\" So you change the yardstick: rather than viewing Lee's conversation with John as a failure, see it as a tiny step in a very long, very gradual, but very vital process. And, as far as Lee is concerned, there is no debate to be had over whether people with learning difficulties can lead a movement; there are no paradoxes, no contradictions and confusions. It may take time, he says, but we are slowly, inexorably headed for a different future. Walmsley provides her own answer to the question she posed earlier - whether in 50 years' time people will look back and say we went too far or not far enough. \"I think we will get further. I'm sure we will get further than we are now. I suppose 50 years from now, we'll be saying that they were very naive, that they could have done this better.\" In 50 years' time, self advocates imagine a world in which people with learning difficulties live independently, earn money, get married, have children. A world in which they are free from harassment and abuse. They can see a future in which People First will be Britain's \"principal pressure group for people with a learning disability\". When the government's minister for disabled people will have learning difficulties. They imagine a day when we will look back at this time and see not a movement that had reached its zenith, but a movement that had only just begun.",

Some royals took a fortifying cup before joining their mistresses. Others, including William III, took it as a pick-me-up after a night of gambling and drinking.</p> <p>The food historian Richard Fitch has studied the archives and discovered that the Oscar-nominated film Chocolat, where the confectioner seduces an entire French village into transports of erotic delight, is not so far of the mark.</p> <p>William may have acquired the habit in the Low Countries, one of the first places in Europe to import cocoa beans.

      "bodyText": "Chocolate, that well known hangover cure and aphrodisiac, will once again be served at Hampton Court this weekend. Hampton Court palace was one of the first places in England where chocolate was regularly served. Some royals took a fortifying cup before joining their mistresses. Others, including William III, took it as a pick-me-up after a night of gambling and drinking. The food historian Richard Fitch has studied the archives and discovered that the Oscar-nominated film Chocolat, where the confectioner seduces an entire French village into transports of erotic delight, is not so far of the mark. William may have acquired the habit in the Low Countries, one of the first places in Europe to import cocoa beans. He clearly took to it in a big way and it became a life long habit, in defiance of the medical advice of his personal physician, Dr Mulligan. \"Throughout the 17th century the argument rages backwards and forwards - is chocolate a food, a drug, a medicine? Is it good for you or very bad, should it be given only to invalids or never given to them?\" said Mr Fitch, who will be cooking 17th century chocolate recipes at Hampton Court for the next nine days. Small samples of the drink, made from hand ground roast cocoa beans, mixed with sugar, water, cinnamon and vanilla, will be offered to visitors. London had its first chocolate house by 1657, and by the 1590s the habit was well enough established at Hampton Court for a special kitchen to be built, just for chocolate. Mr Fitch said: \"In England, unlike the continent, anyone could drink chocolate who could afford it, anyone could go into a chocolate shop, but it was expensive... In 17th century France the crown chocolatier is recorded as having 8lb of chocolate in his personal stores, when there were only 22lb in the country.\" The chocolate kitchen at Hampton Court still survives, in Fountain Court. It was the domain of Mr Nice, the chocolate cook. There are two tantalising references to Mr Nice in the archives - that the kitchen is being created for him, and that lodgings are being built for him - an indication that he was above the status of other servants. It is not known where he learned his trade, or whether he outlived the king, who died in 1702. In Mr Fitch's own household the question of whether it is good or bad for you has been resolved: his two children do not get chocolate Easter eggs. \"Lord no, they get mental, speed around the house and wreck the place. Not a good idea.\"",

Instead the group set out plans to develop a \"sonic cruiser\", a delta-winged plane that would cut 90 minutes off the journey time from London to New York by flying at just under the speed of sound.

We were concerned to see this allegation as it conflicts with the findings of our own rigorous inspection programme. Islam Garments was inspected by Wal-Mart in April 2000 - no child labour was being used then. Nevertheless, we took your article seriously and are conducting additional inspections to make sure local labour laws and our high standards for suppliers are still being met. Wal-Mart has a zero-tolerance policy towards child, slave and forced labour, and any other unethical treatment of workers. It requires suppliers to meet written commitments to the basic principles of human rights, reasonable hours of labour and a safe, clean, healthy and productive working environment. This is backed up by regular and rigorous inspections of all factories from which it sources directly - actions which are improving working conditions for people around the world.

Launching the UK's first mainstream unmetered internet service in March 2000. And your greatest mistake? Taking on the managing directorship of an innovative, but underfunded, online property information business in 1989; then came the property crash. How would you describe your management style? An adrenalin fix for those I manage. Which deal would you most like to have done? The one done by John Pluthero (Freeserve) in 1998 bringing subscription-free internet to the world. What do you find most annoying in your staff? Apathy. Does your organisation have a glass ceiling? Not that I am aware of. What management wisdom is most over-rated? Be cautious my son, be cautious. What is the biggest challenge facing your industry? Educating the world about the benefits of broadband. What single lesson would you pass on to budding managers? Learn to be interested in people... I mean really be interested - not an act. Which management guru do you believe in? I have met several managers whom I admire enormously. People like David Bell at Pearson combine the talent for big company management with a wonderful gentlemanly style... And Barclay Knapp for his ability to enthuse others to aspire to greatness. Who is your management hero? Winston Churchill - great leader, great organiser and a winner. Who is your favourite politician? Michael Foot for his oratory, Edward Heath for winning the Admiral's Cup in 1971. If you could change one aspect of British business, what would it be? Make it more exciting. Do you have a view on British membership of the EMU? We need to do it, but only when the time is propitious to the UK. What phrase or saying do you most over-use? Life isn't fair, it is what you make of it. Apart from quality time with your family, what else makes you happiest in life? Being effective and recognised for it. What annoys you most? Lack of commitment. How do you relax? Sailing a 40ft ketch in the Solent. What is your favourite city? Boston, USA. What is your greatest regret? That my illness three years ago (brain haemorrhage) left me slightly disabled and unable to do some of the physical things that I used to take for granted, though I can still sail! What is your biggest fear? Being ignored... What would you really like to have been? A great footballer playing along- side Best, Charlton and Law.",
