Bishops and self-appointed censors campaigned against it and the Daily described its twin heroines as \"suburban sluts\". Now it seems a harmless divertissement that survives largely as a vehicle for its performers. </p> <p>What caused the furore? Clearly the fact that two married women, living a life of passionless boredom, whip themselves into a state of sexual excitement over the return of a former lover. In the play's celebrated central act they get riotously tipsy as they await the nocturnal arrival of the Gallic Romeo. But, having stoked up the sexual fires, Coward banks them down again in the overly symmetrical final act as each woman falsely believes the other has had a secret assignation with the Gallic intruder. </p> <p>Coward makes some sharp points about male hypocrisy: in particular, the middle-class Englishman's belief that wild oats are things that only chaps may sow. But it's a one-joke play that teases out its central idea to the point of nervous exhaus tion. Coward clearly recognised the problem by beefing up the text in 1958 to give extra prominence to an all-purpose maid, a kind of beskirted Jeeves who exudes an alarming omniscience. </p> <p>But it is the famous drunk scene that people come to see and, in Michael Rudman's production, it is given a frenzy by Felicity Kendal and Frances de la Tour. Kendal is all disintegrating demureness as she tumbles over sofas and strangles herself in telephone cords; de la Tour is more like an inebriated camel as she lopes unsteadily about the stage and peers mournfully at the bottom of empty glasses. Rudman's best innovation is to hint at a suppressed lesbianism as the two dance clingingly together and pass a cigarette from one mouth to another. But the scene would be funnier still if it were less full of expertly choreographed business. </p> <p>Good as they are, the stars are overshadowed by Tilly Tremayne as the sharp-featured maid who knows about everything from golf to tropical medicine and caps her employers' every remark. Stephen Greif wittily plays the French lover as an ambulatory shrug and Eric Carte, angry in plus fours, wonderfully embodies husbandly outrage. The stars do their thing; but it is the supporting actors who, by never overstepping the modesty of nature, justify this revival of Coward's attenuated farce. </p> <p>\u0095 Until March 2001.

Kendal is all disintegrating demureness as she tumbles over sofas and strangles herself in telephone cords; de la Tour is more like an inebriated camel as she lopes unsteadily about the stage and peers mournfully at the bottom of empty glasses. Rudman's best innovation is to hint at a suppressed lesbianism as the two dance clingingly together and pass a cigarette from one mouth to another. But the scene would be funnier still if it were less full of expertly choreographed business. Good as they are, the stars are overshadowed by Tilly Tremayne as the sharp-featured maid who knows about everything from golf to tropical medicine and caps her employers' every remark. Stephen Greif wittily plays the French lover as an ambulatory shrug and Eric Carte, angry in plus fours, wonderfully embodies husbandly outrage. The stars do their thing; but it is the supporting actors who, by never overstepping the modesty of nature, justify this revival of Coward's attenuated farce. \u0095 Until March 2001.

In the US, where the technique is more widespread, Thumbs up Security claims that 99% of shoppers have no objection to leaving their prints and retailers have seen a 75% drop in fraud. The company hopes to convince banks to put the program logo on their credit and debit cards, as well as cheques; and to get retailers to display the logo in their shop windows and buy the ink pads. The thumb print system is understood to be dramatically cheaper to use than the electronic signatures and microchip solutions currently being promoted by the banks and their clearing houses. Thumbs up Security's invisible ink pads only cost around \u00a310 each and, apart from buying the pad, all retailers need to do is advertise the fact that they are using the system.",

I have to say that concerns me. </p> <p>I wouldn't argue that Roy's record with Switzerland was commendable. He took them first to the 1994 World Cup and then to Euro 96. But in terms of profile and expectancy, what he dealt with there was not even close to the pressure that would be heaped on him with England.

When things started to go against him he did not seem able to put his finger on the pulse and stop the rot, even with plenty of money from Jack Walker. </p> <p>In fact when you look at some of his purchases, such as splashing out \u00a37.25m on Kevin Davies and \u00a34.25m on Nathan Blake, you wonder about his record in terms of selection. And I believe the England job is mainly about selection and strategy. </p> <p>Roy is highly regarded as a coach and although the England job encompasses an amount of coaching, you are not going to improve the players' technique that much in the few days you have got them. What you've got to do is make sure you have a group of players who can fit into the pattern you lay down. </p> <p>When you're with a team like Switzerland you haven't got that big a pool to choose from, so the side more or less looks after itself. In England he would have a greater choice and that can create its own problems. </p> <p>Two lads might be performing as well as each other for their clubs and you have got to know who's going to fit better into the international sphere, particularly with the spotlight England's players are put under. </p> <p>I don't want to decry Roy because he has worked very hard to get where he is but we are talking about the England national job here. Someone who has been as successful as him in Switzerland is Christian Gross, but would anybody be touting him as Kevin Keegan's successor? </p> <p>If the FA wants a man with World Cup coaching experience who's possibly available then there's someone up in Newcastle with a better pedigree than Roy Hodgson and that's Jackie Charlton. And he's won a World Cup winner's medal to boot. </p> <p>I know a poll in the Sun this week showed 52% support for Roy Hodgson, 31% for Wenger and 17% for Eriksson but that was a bit false. What people were saying was that they wanted an Englishman rather than a foreigner. If they had put Roy up with Terry Venables and Bobby Robson he may not have got a vote. </p> <p>I'm not opposed to bringing someone in from abroad and believe Eriksson has the right mentality and knowledge for the job. But if I were to choose an Englishman I would sooner go for Peter Reid, John Gregory or in particular Bryan Robson now that Venables has apparently been ruled out. </p> <p>I certainly don't like what the FA has done in appointing Peter Taylor and Steve McClaren. I rate Steve highly and think Peter has the potential to become a top coach, but he's only done a couple of months as a Premiership manager. It's miles too early and I think the pair should be concentrating on their clubs. </p> <p>In any case it's not right to put Peter in that position. If we go to Italy next month and take a spanking, does that set him back four or five years in people's eyes? </p> <p>I know he had a fine record with the Under-21s and went down well with the players, but if he had lost four games at that level no one would have taken the blindest bit of notice.

In the recent past England's isolated victories have usually been down to an act of individual excellence. </p> <p>\"Four players scored half-centuries and each one did exactly what he was earmarked to do,\" said Fletcher. \"I want them to get used to their positions in the side because we have still played a lot fewer one-day internationals than other countries.\" </p> <p>Even the captain Nasser Hussain, who is miscast at No3, looked the part on Tuesday when wickets fell early, though he got out at the right time when he did not have the power to put away the softening ball. </p> <p>Graeme Hick, at four, is still their best batsmen at this level and he continued his eye-catching form with a fluent fifty. Graham Thorpe, with his ability to work the ball, to make and scurry ones and twos, is the perfect five, just as Neil Fairbrother was before him. </p> <p>Fletcher, however, is admirably dissatisfied. \"We have to look at our bowling. On these pitches it is essential that we maintain line and length. You get punished if you don't. In England, if you bowl a bad ball, it might still seam or swing so there is a chance of getting away with it.

Tony Blair is in Belfast today, talking to all the parties involved in the power-sharing peace deal. But one man, first secretary David Trimble, holds the key. On Saturday, the ruling council of his Ulster Unionist party will meet to consider a plea from Trimble's hawkish rival Jeffrey Donaldson for a phased withdrawal from the institutions of devolved government in the province. There has been a flurry of initiatives to help stiffen the resolve of Trimble's supporters. Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson has offered them a symbolic but potent little victory over republican Sinn Fein, by ordering that the union flag be flown over ever public building on important national holidays and commemoration days - including the offices occupied by Sinn Fein ministers. This afternoon, no doubt timed to coincide with the Prime Minister's visit, the Ministry of Defence has announced a life-saving order for new ships to Belfast's ailing Harland and Wolff yard. But the biggest carrot that is being dangled before the unionists is being offered by its sworn enemies in the Provisional IRA. They have agreed to another independent inspection of arms dumps, and have said that they are willing to consider talks in the future on a more permanent disarmament process. Donaldson, predictably, has dismissed the IRA statement as nothing new. Indeed, on the face of it, the Provisionals are only offering to let the independent inspectors have another look at what they have already seen - presumably to make sure it's still there. The second part of the offer is more intriguing, for it holds out the prospect, however distant, of genuine disarmament. The IRA, in its customary convoluted way, says it will talk again with General John de Chastelain - the head of the independent disarmament commission, and surely the least employed man in Ulster - when it is satisfied that such talks would advance the peace process. Decoding that cumbersome formula is not too difficult. The IRA is saying, without pinning itself down in any way, that it expects lots of new concessions from the British government and from the unionists, before it makes its next significant advance towards peace. That means further building work on the cross-border all-Ireland institutions established by the Good Friday accord. Most of all, it means steady progress towards a thorough reform of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. This is the most sensitive issue of all for both communities in Northern Ireland. For republicans, the RUC is a hated symbol of oppression; for unionists, it is an equally potent symbol of their links with Britain. It is this issue which, more than any other, threatens to tear Trimble's party asunder.

It will include advertising, PR and direct marketing and will be conducted through the Young &amp; Rubicam group of marketing companies, which includes the direct marketing agency Impiric and the PR agency Burston Marsteller. The firm split from Arthur Andersen because the accountancy firm had set up its own strategic consultancy arm, making it a competitor to Andersen Consulting.

      "body": "<p>Ivan Massow is a man who attracts oxymorons. A gay businessman who started a financial services company which catered especially for gay men and women long before it was fashionable, he subsequently \"came out\" as a Conservative, becoming friends with Michael Portillo and William Hague. A campaigner against homophobia, he was also a vocal supporter of foxhunting. Steven Norris's running mate in the London mayoral elections, in 1999, he was made the chairman of the Institute of Contemporary Arts. Last year, he was Baroness Thatcher's official companion at the Tory party conference. This August, he defected to Labour, chastising the Conservatives for their nastiness, specifically their stance on section 28.</p> <p>\"I always thought that economically, the Conservative party had taught the country a great deal.

A gay businessman who started a financial services company which catered especially for gay men and women long before it was fashionable, he subsequently \"came out\" as a Conservative, becoming friends with Michael Portillo and William Hague. A campaigner against homophobia, he was also a vocal supporter of foxhunting. Steven Norris's running mate in the London mayoral elections, in 1999, he was made the chairman of the Institute of Contemporary Arts. Last year, he was Baroness Thatcher's official companion at the Tory party conference. This August, he defected to Labour, chastising the Conservatives for their nastiness, specifically their stance on section 28. \"I always thought that economically, the Conservative party had taught the country a great deal.

      "bodyText": "Independent international monitors have inspected IRA arms dumps in Northern Ireland for the second time this year, in a boost to the struggling peace process. \"We specifically announced that we would repeat the inspection of a number of arms dumps by third parties to confirm that our weapons are secure,\" the IRA said. \"We now wish to confirm that this re-inspection has taken place and thank those involved for their co-operation.\" The inspectors, Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa and Martti Ahtisaari of Finland, first examined the sealed weapons stores in June. Their action follows an invitation yesterday from nationalists to confirm that the IRA is abiding by promises it made earlier this year, and comes as the prime minister visits Northern Ireland for talks. Tony Blair hopes to persuade unionists to continue to support the peace process. Concern about it has been growing within the Ulster Unionist Party and has led to a meeting of the UUP ruling council this weekend that may force the party's leader, David Trimble, to resign. That would be a severe blow to efforts to secure peace. In Northern Ireland, the prime minister has taken a robust line on unionist grievances. \"The process cannot be changed,\" he said. \"You cannot have issues like the flags, policing - touchstone issues - subverted or troops kept in nationalist areas to placate unionism. \"The unionists will have to try and learn when something happens that is positive and is a good news story, they have to embrace it with some grace.\" Mr Blair is scheduled to hold talks with Mr Trimble, the Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, and the SDLP deputy leader Seamus Mallon. Mr Trimble is under pressure from hardline unionist's to quit power-sharing with Sinn Fein before Christmas because of the decommissioning issue. However, Mr Adams warned Unionists that if they set a deadline for decommissioning over the coming months they would be throwing the peace process into \"red alert\". He criticised moves by anti-Good Friday agreement Ulster Unionists to persuade their ruling council to force a withdrawal from the power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland on November 30 if there is no disarmament. He said such a move was \"pushing the self-destruct button\". Mr Adams said: \"It will not work that way. We all know that. Those who are putting these proposals know that also.\" However, leading dissident Jeffrey Donaldson said Mr Blair cannot bully Ulster Unionists into backing down on their demands for the IRA to give up its guns. He said: \"Tony Blair flying to Belfast is a sign the Government is putting enormous pressure on David Trimble and the unionists to back down on decommissioning and policing.\" But he added: \"He cannot bully us. He should be putting pressure on republicans to deliver on weapons.\" Meanwhile, the Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson warned that the fall of Stormont would mean the return of direct rule from Westminster with more Dublin intervention. \"If the political structures that we have created collapse, then obviously direct rule will resume and that will involve not just the British government, but the Irish government interfering more in the affairs of Northern Ireland,\" he said. \"If that is what people want in the Ulster Unionist Party, then they know what course of action is open.\"",

We spend more than \u00a34bn a year running the lights and appliances in our homes, but many people don't know what it costs them or the savings they can make,\" says Eoin Lees, chief executive of the Energy Savings Trust (EST), which has carried out a survey of consumer attitudes towards energy consumption. </p> <p>The EST discovered that although 79% of people claim to have an \"environmental conscience\", only 8% consider energy efficiency a key factor when buying household appliances. </p> <p>\"Much of the electricity used in the UK's homes is needlessly wasted and the resultant carbon dioxide released may contribute to global warming,\" says Lees. \"Clearly people see the environment as important, but they haven't made the link between switching on an appliance, the energy it uses and the carbon dioxide that it sends into the atmosphere.\" </p> <p>The government wants to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20% in the next 10 years and is working with the EST to persuade consumers to cut energy consumption. </p> <p>But if you are apathetic about the environmental message, then the savings you can make may encourage you to take action. A few simple steps can save you up to \u00a3250 a year and as the nights draw in, make your home a warmer and cosier place. </p> <p><strong> Household appliances</strong><br> </p> <p> We consume \u00a31.2bn worth of electricity every year just running fridges and freezers. Every time you open the door it takes the appliance three minutes to regain its temperature. One way of saving money is to ensure that your fridge/freezer is regularly defrosted and that food is allowed to cool before storing. Don't put your fridge next to a cooker or boiler, washing machine or dishwasher if you can avoid it, because it will use more energy to keep cool. If your fridge/freezer is more than 10 years old then it is probably worth getting a new one. A new appliance can save you up to \u00a345 a year. All new appliances have to carry an EU energy label which gives details of energy efficiency. Those rated \"A\" are the most energy efficient and as a result are often more expensive than those lower down the scale. </p> <p>As well as the EU energy label, look out for the EST's \"energy efficiency recommended\" label. Products which exceed criteria laid down by the trust and an independent panel of experts will be entitled to carry the label. </p> <p>Washing machines, tumble dryers and dishwashers also use substantial amounts of electricity - again it's worth investing in a new more efficient model if yours is more than 10 years old. For maximum savings always wait until you have a full load before running the appliance and use a lower temperature - a 40C wash cycle uses 30% less electricity than a 60C cycle and many detergents work just as well at lower temperatures. </p> <p>Always switch your TV standby off. Every year TVs use \u00a350m-worth of electricity just waiting to be fully switched on. </p> <p><strong> Lighting</strong><br> </p> <p> Energy efficient lightbulbs, although more expensive than conventional ones, save money in the long run as they use only 25% of the electricity of a normal lightbulb and last up to 10 times longer. If every home in Britain installed just three of them, it would save enough energy to power all the UK's street lights. </p> <p><strong> Heating</strong><br> </p> <p> Replacing an old boiler could save 20% on your fuel bills and if it's a condensing boiler with full heating controls, you could save up to 45%. Condensing boilers are the most efficient because they typically convert around 88% of the fuel into heat compared with 72% for standard boilers. New boilers, like other appliances, carry an EU efficiency rating from A to G. A central heating system with full heating controls could save you up to \u00a385 a year. </p> <p><strong> Insulation</strong><br> </p> <p> Walls lose more heat than any other part of your home. If you live in a home built after the 1930s then it is likely to have cavity walls which can be insulated. It's a straightforward process and can reduce heat loss by up to 60% and save \u00a375 to \u00a3150 on your fuel bills each year. Older houses are likely to need solid wall insulation. This is more expensive and involves insulating and then weatherproofing external walls. </p> <p>You may already have loft insulation but if its not thick enough then you will still lose a lot of heat. Insulation that is at least 20cm thick can save up to 20% on your heating costs. </p> <p>Double glazing is also an option, particularly if you have to replace old windows. Double Low E glazing costs about \u00a3250 more than normal double glazing but it will cut \u00a330 to \u00a340 from your bills each year. </p> <p><strong> New homes</strong><br> </p> <p> If you are considering buying a new home, then some of the hard work will be done for you. From January 1, 2001 house builders with have to provide prospective buyers with information on the energy efficiency levels of all new homes. Construction minister Nick Raynsford says: \"This new requirement will give prospective buyers and first occupiers an idea of how energy efficient the home is and help to promote energy efficiency as a factor in people's decisions on which home to choose.\" </p> <p><strong> Help, advice and grants</strong><br> </p> <p> If you want to ensure that you are saving as much energy as possible, you can get help and advice from a nationwide network of local energy efficiency advice centres. These can also put you in touch with profes sional heating, insulation and glazing installers. It's worth remembering that the VAT charged by these installers is only 5%, rather than the normal 17.5%. For details of your local centre call 0345 2772000. </p> <p>Various grants are on offer from the government, energy suppliers and local authorities. Two million people with oil or liquid petroleum gas heating, for example, are entitled to a grant of between \u00a3175 and \u00a3250 towards the cost of switching to a more efficient condensing boiler. Although grants vary from region to region, the Energy Savings Trust estimates that 51% of homes in Exeter, for example, are eligible for energy efficiency grants and in some areas that increases to more than 70%. </p> <p>For details of grants available contact your local energy efficiency advice centre or check out the EST website - <a href=\"http://www.saveenergy.co.uk.\">www.saveenergy.co.uk.</a> Its database can pinpoint specific grants available in your area, depending on your particular circumstances. </p> <p><strong> Loft insulation</strong> </p> <p> By increasing the depth of loft insulation to at least 8 inches (200mm), you can save \u00a345 on your bills each year </p> <p> <strong> Cavity wall insulation</strong> </p> <p> Installing cavity wall insulation will reduce heat loss through your walls by up to 60% and can save you \u00a375-\u00a3150 from your annual fuel bills </p> <p> <strong> Double glazing</strong> </p> <p> If you are replacing your windows, go for Double Low E glazing.

John Prescott was in talks with leading industry figures to thrash out a strategy for \"getting the situation under control\", a Transport Department spokesman said. Just hours before they met, another derailment put scores more passengers at risk when a commuter train in Surrey skidded on wet leaves and slid into the path of another train, which fortunately managed to stop in time. It came only nine days after the Hatfield disaster, which killed four people and provoked widespread safety restrictions. This morning's incident happened near Virginia Water, Surrey, as the 8.21am South West Trains service from Weybridge to nearby Staines derailed at 8.43am, narrowly missing another train travelling from Reading to Waterloo. Railtrack chiefs last night warned of months of misery ahead as speed restrictions were imposed and engineers worked through the rail network making safety checks. Today's summit at the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions, in London, involved Railtrack chief executive, Gerald Corbett, rail regulator Tom Winsor, Alastair Morton, the head of the Shadow Strategic Rail Authority, and representatives from the train companies. A DETR spokesman said: \"They have been called in to give assurances to the government that everything possible is being done to get the situation under control. \"We are seeing passengers' patience stretched.

The West Coast line, which was closed between the Scottish border and Glasgow at short notice yesterday for safety checks, was reopened ahead of schedule today. A Railtrack spokesman said that 20 sites with problems had been found by engineers, resulting in nine areas on the route between Glasgow and Gretna having speed restrictions of 20mph imposed. Railtrack boss Gerald Corbett said that other speed restrictions and safety checks across the rail network would mean \"inevitable\" passenger delays over the coming months. The company said instances of \"gauge corner cracking\" - a track fatigue phenomenon thought to have caused the Hatfield crash - appeared to have increased. The short-notice closure of the West Coast line added to the lengthy delays nationwide yesterday. Mr Corbett apologised for the short-notice closure of the line and added that \"in situations like these, mistakes can get made\". Nearly all of the 25 passenger train companies reported delays after the closure, with some passengers needing an extra 75 minutes to complete their journeys.

      "bodyText": "Forget opinion polls. The latest way to find out which way the political wind is blowing involves hard cash - and lots of it. In Britain and the United States, betting on politics has become a serious business. The latest case to make headlines cropped up in the Commons this week. Over the summer, those in the know staked \u00a350,000 at bookmakers William Hill on Labour MP Michael Martin being elected to succeed Betty Boothroyd as Speaker of the House of Commons. Mr Martin duly won the job. So who were the prescient punters? According to rumours in the Commons, most of them were MPs who were well-rewarded for their efforts. One Glasgow backbencher is thought to have made \u00a3200,000 on a \u00a310,000 stake. But this is small beer compared with what goes on across the Atlantic. US law bans the kind of bets which have caused a fuss among MPs this week, but in the cradle of capitalism the markets are king and politics, like everything else, is judged in dollar terms. At the head of the pack is a website, the Iowa electronic market, which has become an exchange for political futures. If you are tired of trading in pork belly futures or next year's coffee prices and think that Al Gore is going to make it into the White House on November 7, his stock is currently trading at 48 cents (34p). In the middle of last month, it reached 50.8 cents (36p). The system is simple.

Each unit of stock will pay 35 cents. The trick is, of course, to buy underpriced stock, just as on Wall Street. Stock prices are determined by trading levels. If no one wants to buy, the price falls until they do. Each trader is limited to spending $500 (about \u00a3350) but that has not stopped US political junkies putting several hundred thousand dollars behind their chosen candidates. And they know what they are doing. In the 1996 presidential election, the markets came within two-tenths of Clinton's win of the popular vote (Clinton over Dole, 49.24 to 40.71%). And with Al Gore trading at the moment slightly ahead of his poll rating, we may yet be in for an election surprise. Remarkably, the Iowa site was set up by university academics, keen to interest students in politics, and is run on a not-for-profit-basis. Far more brazen was another US site, Voteauction.com, which allowed electors to put their right to vote up for sale.

      "bodyText": "The main points of the BSE inquiry report published today are: \u0095 Government ministers played down the links between BSE-infected beef and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) and misled the public about the risks posed by so-called mad cow disease. \u0095 The government was \"preoccupied\" with preventing an alarmist reaction to BSE and \"risk communication\" was flawed. \u0095 There was poor enforcement of the 1989 ban on specified bovine offal (brain, spinal cord and other tissue) entering the human food chain. \u0095 Poor communication between government departments meant the Department of Health was not kept informed of the increasing weight of evidence proving a link between BSE and vCJD. \u0095 Ministers and civil servants had no contingency plans for dealing with a situation where vCJD was found to be caused by BSE-infected beef, even years after the first evidence was uncovered. \u0095 The government relied too much on experts from the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) to formulate policy and spent too long consulting with experts before implementing advice. \u0095 There was a \"lack of rigour\" in considering how to turn policy into practice. \u0095 The Meat and Livestock Commission was accused of \"absurd exaggerations\" and a 1995 advertising campaign aimed at reassuring people about the safety of beef was accused of creating a climate where \"hyperbole replaced accuracy\". \u0095 Delays and denials led to the public feeling deceived and undermined confidence in government statements.",

Recent themes have not been huge successes, but Tom Jones is a legend and the song would almost certainly be massive.</p> <p>\u0095 Gladiator director <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Scott,+Ridley\">Ridley Scott</a> has cut together a special montage paying homage to <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Reed,+Oliver\">Oliver Reed</a>, who died while filming the Russell Crowe blockbuster. The montage may be released on the DVD of the smash Roman-era film. The four-minute tribute, spliced together from outtakes of the heavy-drinking actor, is accompanied by the Sex Pistols' version of Sinatra's My Way. Scott says: \"I would like to think the Sex Pistols would say, 'Oh fuck it, let's give it to Ollie...' but it may come down to whether we have to pay for performing rights and whether DreamWorks say it's worth it. It's very amusing and very emotional and moving because right at the end Ollie says, 'That's enough for now.'\"</p> <p>\u0095 Liz Hurley flick <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Title?0230030\">Bedazzled</a> is to be released in the UK with added scenes. A character modelled on members of Britpop outfits Oasis and Supergrass will appear in the British version of Bedazzled, despite having been cut from the US film after test audiences gave it a bamboozled thumbs-down. The star of the Satan-based film, Brendan Fraser, says the rock star was his favourite character in the movie, and that the scene in which the character appeared \"sort of became our homage to Sid And Nancy. We thought we were doing a spoof, like This Is Spinal Tap\".

      "bodyText": "\u0095 Reports suggest that the producers of the next Bond movie are seeking Welsh crooner Tom Jones to perform the title song; Jones previously belted out the opening track to 1965's Thunderball. \"It's early days, but we are desperately keen to have Jones do it,\" a source is quoted as saying. Recent themes have not been huge successes, but Tom Jones is a legend and the song would almost certainly be massive. \u0095 Gladiator director Ridley Scott has cut together a special montage paying homage to Oliver Reed, who died while filming the Russell Crowe blockbuster. The montage may be released on the DVD of the smash Roman-era film. The four-minute tribute, spliced together from outtakes of the heavy-drinking actor, is accompanied by the Sex Pistols' version of Sinatra's My Way. Scott says: \"I would like to think the Sex Pistols would say, 'Oh fuck it, let's give it to Ollie...' but it may come down to whether we have to pay for performing rights and whether DreamWorks say it's worth it. It's very amusing and very emotional and moving because right at the end Ollie says, 'That's enough for now.'\" \u0095 Liz Hurley flick Bedazzled is to be released in the UK with added scenes. A character modelled on members of Britpop outfits Oasis and Supergrass will appear in the British version of Bedazzled, despite having been cut from the US film after test audiences gave it a bamboozled thumbs-down. The star of the Satan-based film, Brendan Fraser, says the rock star was his favourite character in the movie, and that the scene in which the character appeared \"sort of became our homage to Sid And Nancy. We thought we were doing a spoof, like This Is Spinal Tap\".

      "body": "<p><strong> My buddy swears that Tony Greig was born in Australia. I maintain that it was South Africa. Who buys dinner?</strong> asks Howard Yappett from New Haven, Connecticut, USA</p> <p>You can leave your cheque-book at home: Tony Greig was born in Queenstown, South Africa, in 1946. He was a tall (6ft 7ins) gangling allrounder - a hard-hitting batsman and medium-pace bowler who sometimes throttled back and bowled offspin. He played for SA's Border province from 1965-66, then moved to England to join Sussex, for whom he hit 156 in his first Championship match in 1967. He qualified for England (he had British parents), and played 58 successive Tests between his debut in 1972 and 1977. Greig captained England 14 times, but was sacked when it emerged that he was secretly plotting to set up Kerry Packer's World Series Cricket. In Tests he scored 3599 runs at 40.43, with eight centuries, and also took 141 wickets (32.20), including 13 in one match in West Indies in 1974 with that occasional offspin. He was also a fabulous fielder, who took 87 catches in Tests, most of them at second slip. When World Series Cricket started (1977-78) he moved to Australia, and when it stopped he began a long career there as a high-profile commentator for Packer's Channel Nine cricket telecasts, a role in which he remains to this day. His brother Ian also played for Sussex and England, and captained Surrey too.</p> <p><strong>I wonder if you can help me. I am working in Germany and some workmates were asking me about the laws of cricket. I tried to remember that funny poem which has lots of \"outs\" and \"not-outs\" in it. How does it go exactly?</strong> asks Tim Pearce</p> <p>That piece is called \"Cricket as explained to a foreign visitor\", and goes like this:</p> <p>\"You have two sides - one out in the field and one in. Each man that's in the side that's in goes out and when he's out he comes in and the next man goes in until he's out. When they are all out the side that's out comes in and the side that's been in goes out and tries to get those coming in out. Sometimes you get men still in and not out. When both sides have been in and out, including the not-outs ... That's the end of the game.\"</p> <p>It's available on a tea-towel which you can get from the <a href=\"http://www-uk.cricket.org/link_to_database/NATIONAL/ENG/CLUBS/MCC/LordsShop.html\">MCC Shop at Lord's</a></p> <p><strong>My husband's great-great-great-uncle was John Wisden, who played cricket for Sussex. Is he also the founder of John Wisden &amp; Co.?</strong> asks AE Sturrock</p> <p>He most certainly is. John Wisden was born in Brighton in 1826 and died in London in 1884. In between he had a successful sporting career as a bowler, mainly with Sussex, and started a publishing institution. Although he was on the short side he was a useful fastish inswing bowler, who once took all ten wickets in an innings, for North v South in 1850. That year he founded John Wisden &amp; Co., which made sporting equipment for many years (that side of it was eventually taken over by Gray-Nicolls). In 1864 he branched out by publishing a cricket annual: 137 years later Wisden Cricketers' Almanack is still going, stronger than ever.</p> <p> <strong>What were the exact dates of Brian Lara's 375 against England in Antigua in 1993-94?</strong> asks Annemarie Kane</p> <p>Lara started his record innings early on April 16, 1994. He came in when West Indies were 11 for 1, with Stuart Williams was out: it was soon 12 for 2, when Phil Simmons departed for 8. Lara and Jimmy Adams (59) put on 179, and by the first-day close the score was 274 for 3. Lara had 164 and Keith Arthurton 25. They took their stand to 183 next day, before Arthurton was out for 47. By the end of the second day Lara had made 320 and Shivnarine Chanderpaul 41. After a restless night, Lara came out on April 18 with 46 needed to beat Garry Sobers's old Test record of 365 not out, set in 1957-58. It was nervy stuff, and Lara was stuck fast on 347 for 18 minutes, during which time he played and missed at Angus Fraser and was then nearly yorked by him. \"Don't suppose I can call you a lucky bleeder with 347 on he board, can I?\" observed the frustrated bowler. Eventually Lara reached 365, to equal the record. Then a swivelling pull off Chris Lewis took him to 369 and a place in the history books. There was a crowd invasion, and a few minutes afterwards Lara was caught behind by Jack Russell off Andy Caddick for 375. In all he batted for 766 minutes, faced 538 balls, and hit 45 fours. West Indies declared at 593 for 5, of which Chanderpaul's share was 75 not out. He and Lara put on 219. England matched West Indies' total exactly, with Mike Atherton making 135 and Robin Smith 175. The match, not surprisingly, was drawn.</p> <p><strong>Can you tell me something about Geoff Pullar?</strong> asks Norman Strange</p> <p>Geoff Pullar was a stylish left-handed opener who played 28 Tests for England between 1959 and 1962-63, scoring 1974 runs (43.86). He made four Test centuries, the highest of which was 175 against South Africa at The Oval in 1960, when he put on 290 for the first wicket with Colin Cowdrey, who made 155. Pullar suffered a lot with injuries - he hurt his knee in Australia in 1962-63, and never played for England again, then arthritis cut short his first-class career in 1970. He played most of his county cricket for Lancashire (1954-68), although he finished up with Gloucestershire. He was nicknamed \"Noddy\", because he was reputed to be able to nod off to sleep at any time. After he retired from cricket he moved back to Lancashire and ran a sandwich bar.</p> <p><strong>Who were West Indies' wicketkeepers between Jeff Dujon and Ridley Jacobs?</strong> asks Anil Pandit</p> <p>Dujon played his last Test in 1991, and since then West Indies have tried out four wicketkeepers without finding anyone who has approached his panache with the bat and behind the stumps. First to try was David Williams, the tiny Trinidadian: he won 11 caps. Although he didn't have much success a batsman, he did play a vital innings of 65 in West Indies' narrow victory over England in the first of the two nailbiting Port-of-Spain Tests early in 1998. Then came Junior Murray, the first Grenadian to play Test cricket (31 caps). There was a brief flirtation with Courtney Browne, the first West Indian Test player to have been born in England (13 caps), then the selectors turned to the Antiguan Ridley Jacobs (21 caps so far). Jimmy Adams, the current captain, also kept wicket in several one-day internationals (but not for any significant length of time in a Test). Jacobs and Browne are the two keepers for the tour of Australia which starts shortly.</p> <p><strong>Can you tell me the scores from the Nottinghamshire v Surrey county match of 1962?</strong> asks Martin Barned</p> <p>Surrey beat Notts by 156 runs at Trent Bridge in June 1962. Surrey scored 380 for 5 declared and 187 for 2 dec. Notts replied with 224 and 187. It was a good match for Surrey's England players: John Edrich, who was to make his Test debut the following year, scored 216 in the first innings, and Ken Barrington 102 not out in the second. And Tony Lock, the balding left-arm spinner, took 4 for 91 in Notts' first innings and 6 for 45 in the second. The teams also met at The Oval early in August, but that game was a rain-affected draw: Surrey made 233 and Notts 86 for 1.</p> <p>Steven Lynch is acting editor of Wisden Cricket Monthly.

He was also a fabulous fielder, who took 87 catches in Tests, most of them at second slip. When World Series Cricket started (1977-78) he moved to Australia, and when it stopped he began a long career there as a high-profile commentator for Packer's Channel Nine cricket telecasts, a role in which he remains to this day. His brother Ian also played for Sussex and England, and captained Surrey too. I wonder if you can help me. I am working in Germany and some workmates were asking me about the laws of cricket. I tried to remember that funny poem which has lots of \"outs\" and \"not-outs\" in it. How does it go exactly? asks Tim Pearce That piece is called \"Cricket as explained to a foreign visitor\", and goes like this: \"You have two sides - one out in the field and one in. Each man that's in the side that's in goes out and when he's out he comes in and the next man goes in until he's out. When they are all out the side that's out comes in and the side that's been in goes out and tries to get those coming in out. Sometimes you get men still in and not out. When both sides have been in and out, including the not-outs ... That's the end of the game.\" It's available on a tea-towel which you can get from the MCC Shop at Lord's My husband's great-great-great-uncle was John Wisden, who played cricket for Sussex. Is he also the founder of John Wisden &amp; Co.? asks AE Sturrock He most certainly is. John Wisden was born in Brighton in 1826 and died in London in 1884. In between he had a successful sporting career as a bowler, mainly with Sussex, and started a publishing institution. Although he was on the short side he was a useful fastish inswing bowler, who once took all ten wickets in an innings, for North v South in 1850. That year he founded John Wisden &amp; Co., which made sporting equipment for many years (that side of it was eventually taken over by Gray-Nicolls). In 1864 he branched out by publishing a cricket annual: 137 years later Wisden Cricketers' Almanack is still going, stronger than ever. What were the exact dates of Brian Lara's 375 against England in Antigua in 1993-94? asks Annemarie Kane Lara started his record innings early on April 16, 1994. He came in when West Indies were 11 for 1, with Stuart Williams was out: it was soon 12 for 2, when Phil Simmons departed for 8. Lara and Jimmy Adams (59) put on 179, and by the first-day close the score was 274 for 3. Lara had 164 and Keith Arthurton 25. They took their stand to 183 next day, before Arthurton was out for 47. By the end of the second day Lara had made 320 and Shivnarine Chanderpaul 41. After a restless night, Lara came out on April 18 with 46 needed to beat Garry Sobers's old Test record of 365 not out, set in 1957-58. It was nervy stuff, and Lara was stuck fast on 347 for 18 minutes, during which time he played and missed at Angus Fraser and was then nearly yorked by him. \"Don't suppose I can call you a lucky bleeder with 347 on he board, can I?\" observed the frustrated bowler. Eventually Lara reached 365, to equal the record. Then a swivelling pull off Chris Lewis took him to 369 and a place in the history books. There was a crowd invasion, and a few minutes afterwards Lara was caught behind by Jack Russell off Andy Caddick for 375. In all he batted for 766 minutes, faced 538 balls, and hit 45 fours. West Indies declared at 593 for 5, of which Chanderpaul's share was 75 not out. He and Lara put on 219. England matched West Indies' total exactly, with Mike Atherton making 135 and Robin Smith 175. The match, not surprisingly, was drawn. Can you tell me something about Geoff Pullar? asks Norman Strange Geoff Pullar was a stylish left-handed opener who played 28 Tests for England between 1959 and 1962-63, scoring 1974 runs (43.86). He made four Test centuries, the highest of which was 175 against South Africa at The Oval in 1960, when he put on 290 for the first wicket with Colin Cowdrey, who made 155. Pullar suffered a lot with injuries - he hurt his knee in Australia in 1962-63, and never played for England again, then arthritis cut short his first-class career in 1970. He played most of his county cricket for Lancashire (1954-68), although he finished up with Gloucestershire. He was nicknamed \"Noddy\", because he was reputed to be able to nod off to sleep at any time. After he retired from cricket he moved back to Lancashire and ran a sandwich bar. Who were West Indies' wicketkeepers between Jeff Dujon and Ridley Jacobs? asks Anil Pandit Dujon played his last Test in 1991, and since then West Indies have tried out four wicketkeepers without finding anyone who has approached his panache with the bat and behind the stumps. First to try was David Williams, the tiny Trinidadian: he won 11 caps. Although he didn't have much success a batsman, he did play a vital innings of 65 in West Indies' narrow victory over England in the first of the two nailbiting Port-of-Spain Tests early in 1998. Then came Junior Murray, the first Grenadian to play Test cricket (31 caps). There was a brief flirtation with Courtney Browne, the first West Indian Test player to have been born in England (13 caps), then the selectors turned to the Antiguan Ridley Jacobs (21 caps so far). Jimmy Adams, the current captain, also kept wicket in several one-day internationals (but not for any significant length of time in a Test). Jacobs and Browne are the two keepers for the tour of Australia which starts shortly. Can you tell me the scores from the Nottinghamshire v Surrey county match of 1962? asks Martin Barned Surrey beat Notts by 156 runs at Trent Bridge in June 1962. Surrey scored 380 for 5 declared and 187 for 2 dec. Notts replied with 224 and 187. It was a good match for Surrey's England players: John Edrich, who was to make his Test debut the following year, scored 216 in the first innings, and Ken Barrington 102 not out in the second. And Tony Lock, the balding left-arm spinner, took 4 for 91 in Notts' first innings and 6 for 45 in the second. The teams also met at The Oval early in August, but that game was a rain-affected draw: Surrey made 233 and Notts 86 for 1. Steven Lynch is acting editor of Wisden Cricket Monthly.

Lord Woolf said the boys had done everything open to them to redeem themselves, although their crime remained \"horrendous\". He said of the killers, both ten when they were convicted in 1993: \"The one overriding mitigating feature of the offence is the age of the two boys when the crime was committed. \"However grave their crime, the fact remains that if that crime had been committed a few months earlier, when they were under 10, the boys could not have been tried or punished by the courts.\" The teenagers are believed to have been told of Lord Woolf's decision shortly before he announced it in public. Today's decision fell to Lord Woolf after a European Court of Human Rights ruling that judges, not the Home Secretary, should determine jail terms for juvenile killers. Lord Woolf is to set terms in 140 cases, with today's being the first and most controversial. His decision came after more than six months' consultation with the relatives of James and the youths' lawyers. Robert Thompson and Jon Venables were ordered to be detained at Her Majesty's Pleasure at Preston Crown Court in November 1993 for murdering James in February of that year. They had dumped the child's body on a railway line after abducting him from a shopping centre in Bootle, Merseyside. The trial judge, Mr Justice Morland, recommended that they serve a minimum of eight years. The then Lord Chief Justice, the late Lord Taylor of Gosforth, increased that to 10. The tariff was raised again in July 1994 by the then Home Secretary Michael Howard to 15 years but that was quashed by the House of Lords after judicial review proceedings in 1997. Last December, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that it was wrong to try the pair as adults and wrong for politicians to play a part in sentencing. The current home secretary, Jack Straw, then referred the issue of the minimum tariff. Lord Woolf decided to announce the tariff in open court today because of the huge public interest in the case. Denise Fergus and Ralph Bulger, the parents of the murdered two-year-old, were invited to put forward their views before a decision was reached. Three years ago, Lord Woolf criticised Michael Howard for raising the tariff for the young killers. Both Robert Thompson and Jon Venables have been held in a local authority secure unit since they were convicted. Mr Straw has stressed that the tariff set was only a minimum and has insisted neither would be freed until they no longer posed a danger to the public.",

      "body": "<p>Today's launch of the BSE report rekindles the debate about how our society should balance choice and risk. I believe the right way to protect the public in the face of a potentially serious but as yet unknown risk such as BSE, GM foods or the radiation caused by mobile telephones is by the judicious use of the precautionary principle, sometimes paraphrased as \"better safe than sorry\".</p> <p>Steps should always be talen to avoid the legacy of irreversible harm. When a threat is hard to assess by conventional \"probabilistic\" risk assessment methods, it is better to do something than to do nothing. Later, when the risk is better known, precautions can be scaled down.</p> <p>These can range from suppression of a product (as in the EU's ban on artificial use of beef hormones) to restriction of use (antibiotics for animals) and advice (use of mobile telephones by children). This approach does not mean that all innovation should be stopped or slowed the minute risk rears its head. Consumers cannot be 100% protected until all risks are known. Consumers want the benefit of new technologies and sometimes we want the right to take risks.</p> <p>Preventative measures sometimes have costs which we consider unacceptable: for example a mass ban on mobile telephones. To serve consumers well, policymakers need to make a political judgment in the round, balancing the dangers of over-reaction to false reassurance and examining the costs and benefits of both doing something and doing nothing.</p> <p>The story told in the BSE report shows how the precautionary principle could have been applied. The government ignored warnings issued as early as 1979: subsequent delays and mixed messages compounded public fear, eroding trust in government, farming and the food industry. Officials and ministers are criticised for \"cherry-picking\" good news, ignoring scientific caveats and growing doubts, because of political pressure to produce success stories.</p> <p>The precautionary principle was eventually applied, but too flabbily and too late. For example, beef offal was banned from babyfood in February 1988, but BSE did not become a notifiable disease until June, four months later. And the government did not introduce a ban on specified bovine offal material for human consumption until November 1989. Later, a failure to give farmers 100% compensation for cattle killed in a compulsory slaughter scheme ended up being an incentive for concealment. When the link between BSE and the human variant, nvCJD was confirmed in March 1996, the government's inconsistency and delays became obvious.</p> <p>The chief problem was that public statements appeared to be founded on certainty - that beef was safe to eat - but they were accompanied by an acknowledgement of uncertainty. The precautionary principle, properly applied, avoids this pitfall by recognising the limits of knowledge in situations where public health may be under threat. Uncertainty and ignorance are part of the normal spectrum of scientific data and policy-makers should accept that there is no shame in saying: \"We don't know.\"</p> <p>Indeed, it may be the proper thing to do. It is hard to quantify the potential value of the principle, compared to conventional risk assessment, precisely because it is best applied in cases where the risks are unknown. It may be possible to apply actuarial rules to calculate the value on each individual life lost through CJD, but no one yet knows the total likely number of casual ties or the timescale over which that will unfold. Nor can one ever calculate how many people might have died from CJD if the government had not eventually taken precautions at a cost of \u00a34bn, or if the money would have saved more lives if it had been spent differently - on heating insulation for the elderly, for example.</p> <p>The main argument against the precautionary principle is that it is not scientific.

      "bodyText": "Today's launch of the BSE report rekindles the debate about how our society should balance choice and risk. I believe the right way to protect the public in the face of a potentially serious but as yet unknown risk such as BSE, GM foods or the radiation caused by mobile telephones is by the judicious use of the precautionary principle, sometimes paraphrased as \"better safe than sorry\". Steps should always be talen to avoid the legacy of irreversible harm. When a threat is hard to assess by conventional \"probabilistic\" risk assessment methods, it is better to do something than to do nothing. Later, when the risk is better known, precautions can be scaled down. These can range from suppression of a product (as in the EU's ban on artificial use of beef hormones) to restriction of use (antibiotics for animals) and advice (use of mobile telephones by children). This approach does not mean that all innovation should be stopped or slowed the minute risk rears its head. Consumers cannot be 100% protected until all risks are known. Consumers want the benefit of new technologies and sometimes we want the right to take risks. Preventative measures sometimes have costs which we consider unacceptable: for example a mass ban on mobile telephones. To serve consumers well, policymakers need to make a political judgment in the round, balancing the dangers of over-reaction to false reassurance and examining the costs and benefits of both doing something and doing nothing. The story told in the BSE report shows how the precautionary principle could have been applied. The government ignored warnings issued as early as 1979: subsequent delays and mixed messages compounded public fear, eroding trust in government, farming and the food industry. Officials and ministers are criticised for \"cherry-picking\" good news, ignoring scientific caveats and growing doubts, because of political pressure to produce success stories. The precautionary principle was eventually applied, but too flabbily and too late. For example, beef offal was banned from babyfood in February 1988, but BSE did not become a notifiable disease until June, four months later. And the government did not introduce a ban on specified bovine offal material for human consumption until November 1989. Later, a failure to give farmers 100% compensation for cattle killed in a compulsory slaughter scheme ended up being an incentive for concealment. When the link between BSE and the human variant, nvCJD was confirmed in March 1996, the government's inconsistency and delays became obvious. The chief problem was that public statements appeared to be founded on certainty - that beef was safe to eat - but they were accompanied by an acknowledgement of uncertainty. The precautionary principle, properly applied, avoids this pitfall by recognising the limits of knowledge in situations where public health may be under threat. Uncertainty and ignorance are part of the normal spectrum of scientific data and policy-makers should accept that there is no shame in saying: \"We don't know.\" Indeed, it may be the proper thing to do. It is hard to quantify the potential value of the principle, compared to conventional risk assessment, precisely because it is best applied in cases where the risks are unknown. It may be possible to apply actuarial rules to calculate the value on each individual life lost through CJD, but no one yet knows the total likely number of casual ties or the timescale over which that will unfold. Nor can one ever calculate how many people might have died from CJD if the government had not eventually taken precautions at a cost of \u00a34bn, or if the money would have saved more lives if it had been spent differently - on heating insulation for the elderly, for example. The main argument against the precautionary principle is that it is not scientific. A fierce professional debate is raging in which risk assessors warn against the use of \"precaution\" to \"trump science\". My view is that a dual approach is best, and that the precautionary principle is entirely compatible with scientific principles. It applies precisely when risk assessment reaches its limits. Consumers are often accused of being irrational and inconsistent about risk: large numbers of people happily drive at high speeds despite a road death toll which dwarfs the total number of all deaths from CJD, recorded over a 10-year period. However, consumers make subtle risk calculations every day of the week. It is scientists and policymakers who should understand consumers better, rather than the other way round. It is after all, consumer trust which so badly needs rebuilding. Inconsistencies in public attitudes should be seen as inevitable, rather than neurotic. Consumer reaction is coloured by the fact that the risks, real or perceived, are seen as being unnecessary, because the products could be avoided by consumers if sufficient information were given. What angered consumers about BSE was the idea that a risk was being \"foisted\" on them unnecessarily and dishonestly. The public has the right to know the scientific basis and the political justification for a risk decision. Science cannot give us all the answers to the issues raised with new technologies. Acknowledging the limits of knowledge should be seen as a strength and will allow us to adopt a level of precaution that will properly protect public health. \u0095 Anna Bradley is director of the National Consumer Council. comment@theguardian.com",

Henry McLeish's brief spell with East Fife is always mentioned in profiles. It is one of the few immediately interesting things about this 52-year-old man.</p> <p>The late Donald Dewar did not want Henry McLeish to succeed him. He told the world that, when he brutally snubbed Mr McLeish's suggestion that he should become deputy leader of the Scottish Labour party.</p> <p>In private Dewar went further. Just weeks before his death, he reminded me of an incident which, he implied, underlined Mr McLeish's unsuitability for leadership. The occasion was the closure of a tyre factory outside Edinburgh. The Scotsman newspaper had given the Scottish executive a roasting after the factory owners leaked suggestions that they had not received government support they thought they had been promised. The executive said little in its own defence.</p> <p>I had to call Mr Dewar to ask him to explain the silence. Mr McLeish was responsible as the enterprise minister. But I explained that Henry McLeish was not available for comment. He had gone on a private lecture tour to the United States.</p> <p>It seemed strange that a minister with a crisis on his patch had disappeared from view - (stranger still that the Scotsman's then political editor, now widely expected to become Mr McLeish's official spokesman, worked hard to keep the absence secret).</p> <p>When we last spoke, Mr Dewar reminded me of that incident. His concern was Henry's habit of crouching behind the parapet when controversy approached.</p> <p>Mr McLeish has never served in cabinet. If he has any of the intellectual energy or passion of his predecessor he has kept it hidden. As Senator Lloyd Bensen might have put it: \"I knew Donald Dewar. I worked with Donald Dewar. Donald Dewar was a friend of mine. Mr McLeish, you are no Donald Dewar.\"</p> <p>Formal parliamentary endorsement of Mr McLeish's new status is a legal requirement. The Scotland Act obliges MSPs to elect a new first minister within 28 days of the departure of his predecessor. If they don't, a general election is called.</p> <p>So, having won the leadership of his party in an emergency contest against finance minister Jack McConnell, Mr McLeish can be confident that he will be anointed. He and his new wife are looking forward to moving in to their elegant official residence in Edinburgh.</p> <p>From that moment on, things will get difficult for the man the Daily Record in Scotland has dubbed King Henry. He is the leader nobody wanted.</p> <p>Mr McLeish was nearly beaten on Saturday. Among the Labour backbenchers whose votes were not mandated by the occupants of Numbers 10 and 11 Downing Street, he was comprehensively beaten. He squeaked through on the payroll vote. Cynics suggest this is why the Scottish executive has three times as many ministerial positions as it needs.</p> <p>Mr McLeish faces two immediate problems. His backbenchers voted for his opponent. His ministers only supported him out of resid ual loyalty to London. Henry McLeish has a lot to prove.

      "bodyText": "Today the Scottish parliament will formally elect a former professional footballer as the second first minister since devolution. Henry McLeish's brief spell with East Fife is always mentioned in profiles. It is one of the few immediately interesting things about this 52-year-old man. The late Donald Dewar did not want Henry McLeish to succeed him. He told the world that, when he brutally snubbed Mr McLeish's suggestion that he should become deputy leader of the Scottish Labour party. In private Dewar went further. Just weeks before his death, he reminded me of an incident which, he implied, underlined Mr McLeish's unsuitability for leadership. The occasion was the closure of a tyre factory outside Edinburgh. The Scotsman newspaper had given the Scottish executive a roasting after the factory owners leaked suggestions that they had not received government support they thought they had been promised. The executive said little in its own defence. I had to call Mr Dewar to ask him to explain the silence. Mr McLeish was responsible as the enterprise minister. But I explained that Henry McLeish was not available for comment. He had gone on a private lecture tour to the United States. It seemed strange that a minister with a crisis on his patch had disappeared from view - (stranger still that the Scotsman's then political editor, now widely expected to become Mr McLeish's official spokesman, worked hard to keep the absence secret). When we last spoke, Mr Dewar reminded me of that incident. His concern was Henry's habit of crouching behind the parapet when controversy approached. Mr McLeish has never served in cabinet. If he has any of the intellectual energy or passion of his predecessor he has kept it hidden. As Senator Lloyd Bensen might have put it: \"I knew Donald Dewar. I worked with Donald Dewar. Donald Dewar was a friend of mine. Mr McLeish, you are no Donald Dewar.\" Formal parliamentary endorsement of Mr McLeish's new status is a legal requirement. The Scotland Act obliges MSPs to elect a new first minister within 28 days of the departure of his predecessor. If they don't, a general election is called. So, having won the leadership of his party in an emergency contest against finance minister Jack McConnell, Mr McLeish can be confident that he will be anointed. He and his new wife are looking forward to moving in to their elegant official residence in Edinburgh. From that moment on, things will get difficult for the man the Daily Record in Scotland has dubbed King Henry. He is the leader nobody wanted. Mr McLeish was nearly beaten on Saturday. Among the Labour backbenchers whose votes were not mandated by the occupants of Numbers 10 and 11 Downing Street, he was comprehensively beaten. He squeaked through on the payroll vote. Cynics suggest this is why the Scottish executive has three times as many ministerial positions as it needs. Mr McLeish faces two immediate problems. His backbenchers voted for his opponent. His ministers only supported him out of resid ual loyalty to London. Henry McLeish has a lot to prove. His response to his wafer-thin win was to make quasi-nationalist comments, transparently crafted to woo the very backbenchers who voted for his opponent. This is alarming. His election must be endorsed in December by a proper ballot of Labour's electoral college. A deputy leader will be elected simultaneously. It is plain that a deputy elected by the proper procedure will have at least as much authority as a leader who was not. McLeish was protected from defeat this time around because that is what London wanted. The parallels with Labour's Welsh debacle are being discussed. Mr McLeish is indelibly marked as Gordon Brown's man. If his response is to be more nationalist than thou, London may abandon him. That becomes more likely if he fails to set an ambitious agenda. The incompetence, caution and sloth which has characterised devolution so far was only tolerated because Donald Dewar was a towering figure. Henry McLeish lacks that status and has little time to build it. He will have to make hard decisions fast. The devolution project is threatened by public disappointment and nationalist advance. If Mr McLeish cannot unite his own party and defeat the SNP in the looming byelections, the second first minister could soon be replaced by a third. There are brighter ministers serving in the executive. Wendy Alexander and Susan Deacon can both point to accomplishments considerably more solid than those of Mr McLeish. Scotland has not yet approached the point when the fairer sex could anticipate justice in politics. But there are still some radicals who suspect that an Alexander/Deacon leadership might be four times as dynamic as the rule of the invisible man. Tim Luckhurst is a former editor of the Scotsman.

      "bodyText": "A note that was found on one of four bodies raised from the sunken Russian nuclear submarine Kursk, revealed today that at least 23 people remained alive after powerful explosions killed most of the crew. The report, from the ITAR-Tass new agency, was the first sign that anyone had survived the initial blasts that tore apart the submarine and sunk it in the Barents Sea on 12 August. The note did not indicate any cause of the catastrophe. Russian navy chief Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov quoted from the note, which was found in the pocket of a seaman who was identified only as Lieutenant DR Kolesnikov. \"All the crew from the sixth, seventh and eighth compartments went over to the ninth. There are 23 people here. We made this decision as a result of the accident. None of us can get to the surface,\" Admiral Kuroyedov read. \"The note went on to mention the figures 13 and five and then added 'I am writing blindly',\" the admiral told families of the crew, who were gathered in the northern Russian port of Murmansk. Many Russian officials had suggested that some crew members could have remained alive after the disaster, as indicated by reports of tapping sounds which were detected from the submarine in the first days. But others discounted the reports as unsubstantiated and said that the sounds could have been caused by collapsing equipment or the submarine settling into the seabed. The note may indicate that the survivors of the initial explosions died of drowning, hypothermia or high pressure. Russian and Norwegian divers have recovered four bodies after five days of painstaking work to cut holes in the top of the submarine. The complex underwater operation is being performed with leading-edge diving equipment, including robots and mechanical arms. Divers used an instrument that sprays pressurised water mixed with diamond dust to cut the Kursk's two-inch thick inner steel hull. Officials say that up to two-thirds of the crew were probably blown to dust by powerful explosions in the weapons room in the submarine's bow. Admiral Kuroyedov had warned that he might cancel the recovery effort if experts said that divers' life was in danger. Two widows of the Kursk crew members visited the Regalia yesterday and, on behalf of all the families, pleaded with the divers not to take excessive risks. But Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, had promised to recover the bodies at an emotional meeting with the crew's relatives shortly after the disaster, and the government seems determined to conduct the costly effort despite the shortage of funds for the military. Some Russian media have pointed out that, by stubbornly continuing this risky policy, the government wants to vindicate its confused response to the sinking of the Kursk, when it resisted foreign help for days while botching its own rescue efforts. The cause of the disaster remains unknown, with authorities pointing at a collision with a Western submarine, second world war mine or an internal malfunction as possible reasons.",

      "body": "<p>I have to confess to feeling more than a little trepidation at the prospect of interviewing Sheila Kitzinger. She is unequivocally the high priestess of natural childbirth, a household name whose numerous books are hungrily consumed by expectant parents. She has done more to change attitudes to childbirth in the past 40 years than anyone else, conducting a relentless crusade against the medicalisation of childbirth and the detrimental way in which the hands-on experience of midwives has been subjugated to the greater pathological experience of obstetrician. </p> <p>I, meanwhile, earned the unenviable status of Public Enemy Number One in the eyes of the natural birth movement after writing an article earlier this year for this newspaper. In it I dared to put into print criticisms that countless parents feel once the reality of labour and new parenthood fails to match up to the natural birth ideal. I could barely believe the heated passion of some of the responses. Alongside phone calls and letters of support, I got hate mail, while the National Childbirth Trust (NCT) website appeared to talk of little else for months, with some members taking it very personally and demanding that I be sent on an NCT training course to be \"put right\". Now, I prepared to enter the laird of the queen bee herself, complete with birthing stools as coffee tables and batiks of birth symbols lining the walls. Would I emerge alive? </p> <p>Kitzinger shot to prominence in 1962 with the publication of The Experience of Childbirth. The medicalisation of childbirth was at its peak in the late 1950s and Kitzinger's message - that birth was a powerful and exhilarating psychosocial, even sexual event where women needed to retain control - struck a chord with countless parents. There's no doubting her impact: as a result of her efforts, doctors now at least question the need for routine enemas, shaving and episiotomies and accept that the missionary position may not be the best one for giving birth. </p> <p>But the flip side of this revolution has also been damaging. Childbirth is now more politicised than at any point in its history. Women are caught between two polarised stools of high-tech, medicalised birth and natural childbirth. Two surveys published in the past week alone illustrate the opposite ends of the debate. One based on a small sample found that babies born to mothers under the influence of Pethidine were at a slightly higher risk of becoming drug addicts as adults. The other found that mortality and morbidity rates for breech babies were reduced if they were delivered by caesarean section. The first seemed to strike a blow for natural childbirth, the second to push women further into the arms of the doctors. </p> <p>Kitzinger, 71, is a likeable woman - funny, intelligent, warm and keenly alert and youthful. She is also that rare thing in the modern western world, a genuine feminist social revolutionary. \"We are there, marching. You've got to change the system, you've got to change society, you need revolution!\" she exhorts with a large laugh, her fists in the air. \"For me, childbirth, preparation for childbirth and looking back on childbirth as well as making sense of it is to do with feminism, with women reclaiming their bodies.\" Revolutionaries can afford few regrets in case they should be deterred from their cause and Kitzinger admits to few. The drawbacks to her crusade are secondary to the aim of changing the culture in which women give birth. \"It's not pleasant to have anything polarised, it can be nasty and upset relationships, but maybe we need to be uncomfortable, maybe that is how sparks are produced which compel new creative thinking.\" </p> <p>She is a workaholic, a social anthropologist by training who loves nothing more than being out in the field with women in labour to learn from the experience. She struggled as a mother to marry her own career needs and aspirations with those of her five daughters. \"I suppose there's a little bit of me that thinks, if I'd stayed home, prided myself on my apple pie and not argued so much then it might have been easier for some of the girls to have gone and done their own thing. But I don't think you can prepare girls for growing up for the world in which we live today, a world which needs to be changed, by simply seeing yourself in the mother role. I wanted to have warrior children.\" </p> <p>Her passionate enthusiasm stems from her own experience of birth: five exhilarating, \"enjoyable\" labours without complications. \"I remember thinking the first time I had a baby, now this is a sport I can do. In the first stage of labour it's a bit like swimming in very powerful waves, icy-cold water with pebbles being raked up and dashing at your body and bruising you, it's thrilling and you go with the waves.\" (\"You think I'm a sado-masochist, don't you?\" she said subsequently. \"Are you?\" I asked. She didn't reply, just smiled). </p> <p>But the real seeds were sown by her mother, a midwife and active campaigner for birth control, who counselled women in her own sitting room with little Sheila hiding behind the sofa. Her mother clearly had a profound influence on her life. There were tears in her eyes as Kitzinger recalled how she had been with her on the day she died, some 20 years ago. \"Mother was passionately concerned about different aspects of women's lives, but she left school when she was 14 and hadn't ever had the education to do the things she needed to do. I felt that I had the education and therefore it was my duty to take her work forward.\" </p> <p>Kitzinger talks openly about the fact - a statistical curiosity even to her most ardent fans - that three of her five daughters are lesbians. She says she has never wondered why. \"It may be very uncritical of me, people have questioned whether this may be a reaction to me and my work, that they've gone off and become lesbians in order to avoid childbirth but it all seems to make sense to me. My work dovetails absolutely with what my lesbian daughters are doing in the field of gender relationships, the right of women to decide on their own sexuality and express themselves openly.\" </p> <p>But behind this wall of rather categoric certainty I detect more than a hint of vulnerable conciliation, acceptance even that there has been a certain amount of negative fallout from her work. She has been hurt by accusations from journalists who have blamed her for their own difficulties with childbirth and breastfeeding. \"I pretend that it doesn't, but of course it hurts. I thoroughly enjoyed labour and everything I am doing and have always done in childbirth has to do with that joy. But I meet many women who have had terrible experiences, who are deeply traumatised by their birth experiences and I have to take that on board. I must confess that I find depression very difficult to cope with in anybody else because I've never been depressed.\" </p> <p>Unlike many in the natural birth movement, she supports women who choose to have an elective caesarean and accepts that some women \"feel deceived, cheated by their experience of birth. The NCT teachers would say we don't just teach for women who want drug-free births and that's true, but their whole raison d'etre is just that. The NCT says that women must be able to make informed choices and that's important, but I think we need to go a stage further and acknowledge the emotional pain and all the pressures that women are under. Childbirth has become a performance art and that's so sad because it is an intense living experience involving all our emotions.\" </p> <p>Though she was a founder member of the NCT she fell out with the organisation for a time in the 70s when she published The Good Birth Guide. They decided that the book was causing harm, undermining the good relations with senior hospital staff that they had painfully built up over the years, and passed an overwhelming vote of no confidence in her. \"It's silly really, but that still hurts.\" </p> <p>Clearly she feels many of her ideals have been misrepresented. </p> <p>\"We've failed to see birth as something which is overwhelming and that relates to my image of the waves of the sea. This is not something you learn like you use a computer and have control over it and part of the glory of it is that you are overwhelmed just as you are when you are making love. Lots of people don't understand why I make the sexual analogy but when you're about to have an orgasm, you can't time it or say I'm going to breathe this way and it's going to be just right because I've practised, you go with it and you can't say no to it. It's the same with birth - certainly in the second stage of labour.\" </p> <p>Birth may be safer now than it has ever been, but things can and do go wrong and that understandably raises anxiety levels in the mother and all those around her. It was one last passing comment from Kitzinger which made me wonder whether it may be this all-pervasive anxiety about labour that lies at the root of our need to control it, whether that be \"naturally\" at home in a water pool, or plugged into a monitor in hospital. \"People feel the need to give advice because they're anxious. When I start dishing out advice it is usually because I'm not centred and it's usually dumb advice.\" I did a double-take - her books are full of advice. Is her need to control and inculcate better practise among new mothers actually born of an acute anxiety? Beneath that warrior revolutionary is there just another anxious, bossy, caring but controlling mother who asked me if I needed to go to the loo before I set off for home? </p> <p>\"I try not to say 'should' and I try to explore different things that women do in different circumstances and act as a channel for how women live their lives.\" So what advice would she give to all those women out there who feel they have failed to have the supremely enjoyable, quasi-sexual experience of childbirth that she is so openly exultant about? \"They probably have been let down by what they perceived as 'natural' childbirth, we often tell women that they ought to take control of aspects of their lives in a way which makes them feel failures as soon as it's unsuccessful. What we omit to talk about is the social situation in which they found themselves. If a woman says that she feels she has failed, my first reaction would be to say that I understand that and then I would ask if she felt that there were others who had failed her, and then you can begin to deconstruct it, the pressures that exist on the midwife or obstetrician.\" The idea that it may be the very ethos of natural childbirth that has failed women does not enter the equation. On with the revolution! </p> <p>\u0095 Rediscovering Birth by Sheila Kitzinger is published by Little Brown at \u00a318.99. Life after Birth by Kate Figes is published by Penguin at \u00a37.99</p>",

      "body": "<p>Wandering around the galleries in the excruciatingly picturesque Normandy port of Honfleur, you could easily conclude that it would have been better for art if all the Impressionist painters had been tied up in a sack and drowned like kittens. </p> <p>Even Michael Wilson, exhibitions officer at the National Gallery, seemed to agree - and he is about to unleash a pack of Monets, Cezannes, Sisleys and Renoirs on the British public. \"Oh dear,\" he sighed, gazing in dismay into the window of one of Honfleur's many private galleries. </p> <p>It was in this town, almost 130 years ago, that Monet painted his gorgeous picture Towing of a Boat at Honfleur. Eugene Boudin, seen variously as the last precursor of Impressionism or the first of the pack, spent most of his long life in the town and painted every corner of it. Almost all the artists dubbed Impressionists (they never labelled themselves that way) came at some stage to stay at a farm on a hill just outside the town - where the landlady gave jugs of cider and long credit - painting sunlight dappling through the apple tree branches. Their long shadows now lie disastrously on the artists who jockey for easel space around the old harbour. </p> <p>The Impressionists are very big business, arguably the most genuinely mass popular movement in art history. Over a century after they were first exhibited to hoots of laughter and howls of derision, the acres of dapply leaves and ripply waters, bosomy barmaids and paddling moppets are cherished by people who are never likely to buy a reproduction of a Rembrandt, a Delacroix or a Picasso, still less a Hirst or an Emin. The real thing packs auction rooms to the gunwhales; for the megastars, a Van Gogh bootlace or sunflower petal, say, an international frenzy breaks out. </p> <p>The National Gallery's new exhibition Painting Quickly in France is dedicated to the movement that officially began with an exhibition organised in Paris in 1874 by a group of artists who went under the cumbersome name of the Anonymous Society of Artist Painters, Sculptors, Printmakers, Etc. Among the 165 works was a painting by Monet called Impression, Rising Sun. The rest was art history and 1,000 miles of gifte shoppe tea towels. </p> <p>The French tourist office knows it is on to a winner. A small fortune has just been spent creating six Impressionist art trails for tourists. You can make pilgrimages following Light, River, Sea, Townscapes, Gardens and the Moment. Visitors to Caudebec-en-Caux, just downstream from Rouen, are invited to stand on the banks of the Seine, ignore the giant car transporters and petrol tankers blotting out the landscape, and turn instead to a panel reproducing Sisley's lyrical dazzle of light on the great wide stretch of still water. </p> <p>There are panels all along the sea front at Le Havre, a town so devastated by Allied bombing in the second world war that the tourist authorities now market it as \"France's only 20th century town\". The front, in fact, charts the speed of the rise of the Impressionist movement: at one end, under the cliff at Sainte Addresse, there is a Monet from the early 1860s, flowingly painted but very traditionally conceived and composed. At the other end of the harbour, there is a panel of Rising Sun, painted probably only five years later, with all the details, boats, masts, cranes, huts, dissolved in calligraphic scribbles into the light. </p> <p>Is it still possible to look beyond the Renoir umbrellas, the Manet Folies-Berg\u00e8res beer mats and the Monet waterlily silk ties, and actually see the Impressionists? Is there anything new to be said about them, any intellectual justification for another exhibition beyond a guaranteed crowd-pleaser for a gallery overshadowed by the success of Tate Modern? </p> <p>Absolutely so, say the National Gallery's director Neil MacGregor and curator Rick Brettell, an American art scholar who has also written the exhibition catalogue. \"What has not been looked at before is the sheer pleasure of the swirl of paint,\" says MacGregor. Pleasure is a shocking justification for an exhibition in these days of pity and terror in art. But MacGregor says there's much more to the show than a display of \"icons of pleasure\". Both men argue that recent scholarship has been hung up on the intellectual and social context of the movement, its classical antecedents, its place in art history, and the startling fact that the subjects of these pictures are generally neither the traditional wealthy patrons, nor the attractively ragged peasants of genre painting, but a new class, the cheerful bourgeoisie. </p> <p>They suggest that this approach may have paid dividends in terms of art history, but misses the quality that made these pictures seem revolutionary, even shocking to their contemporaries. The Impressionists were exhibiting and selling pictures that would have seemed half-finished a decade earlier, the paint dragged, scraped, swirled and smudged across the surface, often leaving raw canvas showing through. Art history, Brettell argues, has a vested interest in making painting appear dense, multilayered, difficult. \"Painting quickly\" confounds the scholars. </p> <p>Brettell approached the exhibition with this belief, but he now has empirical proof of it. The show has borrowed from all over the world, but there are a few gaps. Several institutions were so affronted by the title Painting Quickly, that they refused to lend.

Microscopic analysis revealed a little patch of blown sand, trapped forever in the tacky paint - just like the legend. </p> <p>But not all the pictures were dashed off in an hour's lather of perspiration and inspiration. A second's thought is enough to realise that Manet's famous Races at Longchamps couldn't possibly have been done on the spot, or the artist would have ended up as cat meat, trampled under the horses' thundering hoofs. Even Monet's Rising Sun, which appears to have been breathed in one sigh of oil paint and genius straight onto the canvas, is no such thing either. In other works, such as a desolate and icy wintry river landscape painted after the death of his first wife, he carefully left a blank circle of canvas so that he could swirl in a blaze of orange for the sun without the paints smearing.

      "bodyText": "Wandering around the galleries in the excruciatingly picturesque Normandy port of Honfleur, you could easily conclude that it would have been better for art if all the Impressionist painters had been tied up in a sack and drowned like kittens. Even Michael Wilson, exhibitions officer at the National Gallery, seemed to agree - and he is about to unleash a pack of Monets, Cezannes, Sisleys and Renoirs on the British public. \"Oh dear,\" he sighed, gazing in dismay into the window of one of Honfleur's many private galleries. It was in this town, almost 130 years ago, that Monet painted his gorgeous picture Towing of a Boat at Honfleur. Eugene Boudin, seen variously as the last precursor of Impressionism or the first of the pack, spent most of his long life in the town and painted every corner of it. Almost all the artists dubbed Impressionists (they never labelled themselves that way) came at some stage to stay at a farm on a hill just outside the town - where the landlady gave jugs of cider and long credit - painting sunlight dappling through the apple tree branches. Their long shadows now lie disastrously on the artists who jockey for easel space around the old harbour. The Impressionists are very big business, arguably the most genuinely mass popular movement in art history. Over a century after they were first exhibited to hoots of laughter and howls of derision, the acres of dapply leaves and ripply waters, bosomy barmaids and paddling moppets are cherished by people who are never likely to buy a reproduction of a Rembrandt, a Delacroix or a Picasso, still less a Hirst or an Emin. The real thing packs auction rooms to the gunwhales; for the megastars, a Van Gogh bootlace or sunflower petal, say, an international frenzy breaks out. The National Gallery's new exhibition Painting Quickly in France is dedicated to the movement that officially began with an exhibition organised in Paris in 1874 by a group of artists who went under the cumbersome name of the Anonymous Society of Artist Painters, Sculptors, Printmakers, Etc. Among the 165 works was a painting by Monet called Impression, Rising Sun. The rest was art history and 1,000 miles of gifte shoppe tea towels. The French tourist office knows it is on to a winner. A small fortune has just been spent creating six Impressionist art trails for tourists. You can make pilgrimages following Light, River, Sea, Townscapes, Gardens and the Moment. Visitors to Caudebec-en-Caux, just downstream from Rouen, are invited to stand on the banks of the Seine, ignore the giant car transporters and petrol tankers blotting out the landscape, and turn instead to a panel reproducing Sisley's lyrical dazzle of light on the great wide stretch of still water.

Is it still possible to look beyond the Renoir umbrellas, the Manet Folies-Berg\u00e8res beer mats and the Monet waterlily silk ties, and actually see the Impressionists? Is there anything new to be said about them, any intellectual justification for another exhibition beyond a guaranteed crowd-pleaser for a gallery overshadowed by the success of Tate Modern?

      "body": "<p>We arrived at Prospero's domain on a sweltering August night. Behind three gates, reached on foot by means of a path clinging to a promontory half-shrouded in clouds, Gore Vidal's and Howard Austen's villa at Ravello (south of Naples) is indeed well-named: La Rondinaia or swallow's nest. It strangely reminded me of Hitler's eagle's nest at Bertchesgaden - if only in this respect: it, too, is the domain of a paranoid genius. For who but a paranoid genius would so separate himself from the world?</p> <p>From the tiny port below, Ravello is a death-defying taxi ride along a corniche road like the one on which Princess Grace of Monaco died. Perhaps this is why neither Gore nor Howard drives any more but instead use taxis and chauffeured cars to go back and forth from their inaccessible fortress. The combination of preprandial drinking and hairpin turns would certainly not be good for their health. Indeed the switchbacks carved into the limestone ledges are so narrow that the passage of a bus or a truck stops traffic behind you for several minutes. You have to be truly dedicated to visit Gore Vidal. We were.</p> <p>I had known Gore since about 1990 when my seventh novel, Any Woman's Blues, was published in Italy and Gore invited me to lunch at his apartment in Rome. It was a chilly lunch. He had a bone to pick with me. In one of my novels, I had quoted a witticism of his that had been repeated to me by a mutual friend, and Gore was pissed off. What I had thought of as a tribute to his wit, he had thought of as a deliberate misquotation or attack and we were off to a bad start. The witticism concerned Princess Margaret, one of his best pals, and Gore was stung. I apologised and we went on with our lugubrious lunch, but I felt unforgiven at heart. Gore was not drinking that day and he seemed terribly depressed. I left his apartment in Rome thinking: this is the saddest man I've ever met. But his rare intelligence intrigued and delighted me (as it always had in his extraordinary books) and I was eager to see him again. He gave me an autographed copy of his edition of the stories of Tennessee Williams and in the front flap I remember writing about the afternoon: \"The coldest man I've ever met and the saddest. What is at the root of his sadness? The depression is contagious. I came away very depressed.\"</p> <p>Gore represented an enigma to me: a man with the world at his feet who seemed so terribly hurt by the smallest slight. If he could nurse a grudge about a throwaway line in a novel, imagine what melancholy lurked beneath that guarded, aristocratic exterior. He fascinated me. I loved his writing, was dazzled by his intellectual courage, and I was prepared to like the man, but his grievance-collecting got in the way. Still, a mutual friend kept bringing us together. Whenever we met, I sensed great vulnerability in this complex and brilliant man. Maybe I was even a little in love with his fierce intellect. I do tend to fall in love with exceptional brains.</p> <p>Once in Ravello, a lovely car-free town clinging to the top of a cliff above the sea, you proceed on foot to the gates of a small hotel where you encounter the first set of bells, mounted on a stucco wall. There it says: La Rondinaia. You ring the bell and proceed along a private path that clings to the mountainside. The view is dizzying and will become ever more so as you proceed toward the lair of the maestro. Another gate, another bell. Howard Austen, Gore's companion of 30-plus years, answers, saying in his New York accent: \"Go neither left nor right but straight ahead until you can go no more. There will be another gate.\" (Three gates to the city, hallelujah!)</p> <p>Another precipitous path, clouds below, cypresses and umbrella pines above. A marmalade cat comes out to greet you with a wriggling grey mouse in its teeth. For this is the house of a cat-lover whose practised hauteur belies his tenderness. Gore Vidal is a brilliant writer who needs to be told constantly how brilliant he is.</p> <p>We walk along the pine needle- softened path (led by the cat with the dying mouse in its mouth), until we come to the third gate - this one unmarked. Again we ring. Again Howard's voice leads us: \"Go neither right nor left but straight ahead.\" The pool will be below. Again we obey.</p> <p>Soon we are descending a rocky stair that leads to a dark azure pool and, standing beside it, Prospero himself, an amber sunset whiskey in his hand.</p> <p>Gore is rather more bearish than the last time I saw him, but still handsome, his leonine head beginning to soften with dewlaps, his fiercely intelligent eyes surrounded by innumerable wrinkles. None of this uglifies him. Ageing has only made him more charismatic somehow.</p> <p>You think of Byron at Missolonghi, ravaged by life at 36. But Gore is 75 and has had a good long run of looks, love, fame, fortune. Both life and literature have been good to him - if literature can ever be said to be good to any misunderstood genius. Literature is a mean mistress who always betrays her lovers in the end, refusing promised glories, proffering instead out-of-print books, publishing houses sold to movie studios and television networks, decades of passionately-written novels forgotten as a new generation comes along demanding books written in their own voice. But despite all that, it's been a good run. He was a beautiful young man, a bestselling author at 21 and now, living in splendour like a Renaissance prince, he is still writing at the top of his form.</p> <p>\"If I were a great writer,\" he says, \"I could be living in Brooklyn Heights.\"</p> <p>He is referring to that dinner party I gave for him in New York a few years ago to which Norman Mailer - who lives in Brooklyn Heights - also came. (The two one-time enemies actually broke bread together.)</p> <p>\"But you are a great writer,\" I say.</p> <p>\"I know,\" he says playfully. \"But I'd be even greater if I lived in Brooklyn Heights.\"</p> <p>\"I think Norman's in Provincetown this summer,\" I say.</p> <p>\"Even better!\" Gore roars. \"Maybe I'd be great if I lived in Provincetown.\"</p> <p>I think how odd it is that he should raise his old enmity with Norman. But I know writers - \"ingrown toenails\" as Henry Miller (who preferred to hang out with painters) called us. It is not enough to succeed. All your friends and contemporaries must fail. Writers are like this even when we try like hell not to be.</p> <p>I myself hate that old Hemingwayesque paradigm of the writer as prizefighter and I have tried hard to create an alternate one for myself. When Anne Sexton admonished me, \"We are all writing God's poem,\" I took it to mean there should be no competition between writers because we are all involved in a common project, a common prayer. But to Gore's and Norman's generation, particularly those male writers who served in the second world war, the prizefighter paradigm remains. They still want to KO each other, even at 70-odd. In a way, this is the tragedy of their generation. Their teeth were cut on the war and they never relinquished its us-and-them mentality.</p> <p>Gore tells us about the house. It is a cliff-dwelling, on many levels, and the rock it perches on is so steep that a glance over the balcony from his study gives me instant vertigo. Once owned by the daughter of an English Victorian lord, La Rondinaia has innumerable acres of terraces where grapes, olives and lemons grow, towering cedars, endless steps and balconies above the sea. It is not accessible by automobile. You must walk to this eyrie, an anomaly that has obviously preserved it as one of the most beautiful spots on earth.</p> <p>\"How does it go?\" Gore asks. \"Perfection of the life or of the work? One of the stupidest lines in English poetry. Who was it?\"</p> <p>\"Yeats,\" I said.</p> <p>\"Ridiculous,\" said Gore. \"The truth is you don't have to choose.\"</p> <p>\"Choose what?\" I asked.</p> <p>\"Perfection of the life or of the work. Neither is possible.\"</p> <p>So we wander up the steps to the house and are shown some of it: the hall leading to the salotto with its 17th-century canvases, the salotto itself with its Graeco-Roman head of Zeus and first century mosaic floor mounted as a wallpiece (which cannot be taken out of Italy, says Howard). Gore seems a bit bored with the house tour as if he has done it a few too many times.</p> <p>Howard brings us drinks, complaining of the heat. He and I commiserate about global warming. Then we follow Gore into his study overlooking the sea as if from heaven, the guest suite that might have been ours had we been invited to stay, the terrace overlooking the sea where Sting and Trudie, Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins sang all night at a July 4th party, the grand dining room with its faux-Roman chairs (from the movie set of Ben-Hur), the sitting room with its framed pictures of old pal Princess Margaret.</p> <p>And so at last to sup at the newly refurbished Hotel Sasso, a restored palazzo also hanging over the sea. At the main square in Ravello, Gore is greeted by all and sundry as \"maestro\". An agreeable thing for a famous artist who becomes a habitu\u00e9 of this country is the nod to the maestro that is semi-automatic with Italians. Like Americans, Italians may not read, but they understand that a maestro, even a maestra, is someone to be honoured. If they cannot really distinguish between the brilliance of a Gore Vidal and, say, the pulp of a Danielle Steel, at least they know that a scrittore or scrittrice is a person of consequence.</p> <p>Tongue loosened by many drinks, Gore discusses his plans for his estate. Upon his demise, La Rondinaia will become a study centre for his alma mater, the St Alban's school - but how to administer it? Gore has reached the age of estate-planning. I am all too familiar with this age and also with the cat-and-mouse game benefactors play with their possible heirs.</p> <p>Sitting in the bar for yet another round of drinks before dinner, Gore and Howard opine on what a perfect place the Sasso would be as a retirement home. When the universal condition of life - decay and death - catches up with even the most exalted artists, they succumb to primal fear. I realise I am sitting with an elderly gay couple without children who are facing their declining years with trepidation. They may have plenty of money, a fantastic villa on a promontory of the Italian coast, but they have already experienced a few health scares and they know they are no longer immune to death.</p> <p>That vulnerability is, I think, what makes The Golden Age, Gore's latest novel, so remarkable even in his remarkable oeuvre. He has always been an essayist who fell into the writing of novels and some of his novels seem more essays than novels. But in this one, as in Smithsonian Institution, his last historical fiction, there is an understanding of history and its vicissitudes that no other contemporary writer possesses.</p> <p>Long before anyone else, Gore identified what he dubbed \"The National Security State\", a United States that prepares constantly for war while preaching peace, and nailed its root cause: the need to keep the wheels of commerce turning to the tune of billions of dollars of defence spending per year. Like the 18th-century philosophers who framed the Constitution, he is for a true republic in which the people who participate have some grasp of history. He is outraged by the course the United States has taken in the past 50 years, as indeed the framers of its Constitution would be. Gore sees a Congress bought by special interests, and two parties vying to keep the war machine up and running with American tax dollars.</p> <p>I recently asked Gore what he thought of the-too-close-to-call race between George W Bush and Al Gore, his distant cousin. He replied: \"They are both part of a political system neither of them invented, but Albert is much more intelligent. If you have a bad system, the best thing to do is pick the most intelligent leader. Clearly Al Gore is more intelligent. But the rot goes deep and the system will crumble if we just wait. One big plunge of the stock market could topple the corporate interests that run things.\"</p> <p>Then he talked about his tour through Britain, speaking at Cambridge and Oxford, encountering huge crowds of students everywhere he went. He was impressed by the young people who came to hear him, far less impressed by reviewers of his latest novel who seemed to have no historical education and therefore no context in which to place his fiction. For a writer steeped in Herodotus and Plotinus to be reviewed by those who have read neither must be galling.</p> <p>Gore is at heart an 18th-century man who belongs among those framers of the American Constitution - men who knew their Greek and Roman history and philosophy, and took the long, historical view of governments. His living on a promontory surrounded by ancient artefacts is indeed just what an 18th- century philosopher would do. He lives in splendid isolation - aiming fiery feuilletons at a dumb and dumber world.</p> <p>Gore Vidal understands what America might be if it didn't betray its own ideals - the ideals we gave the world and then renounced in favour of corporate oligarchy and the perpetual war machine.</p> <p>When we said goodbye after dinner and headed back to the sailboat we had anchored on the coast, I was inspired. Gore Vidal is everything a writer should be: a voice for sanity in a mad world.</p> <p>\u00a9 2000 Erica Mann Jong. All rights reserved.

There it says: La Rondinaia. You ring the bell and proceed along a private path that clings to the mountainside. The view is dizzying and will become ever more so as you proceed toward the lair of the maestro. Another gate, another bell. Howard Austen, Gore's companion of 30-plus years, answers, saying in his New York accent: \"Go neither left nor right but straight ahead until you can go no more. There will be another gate.\" (Three gates to the city, hallelujah!) Another precipitous path, clouds below, cypresses and umbrella pines above. A marmalade cat comes out to greet you with a wriggling grey mouse in its teeth. For this is the house of a cat-lover whose practised hauteur belies his tenderness. Gore Vidal is a brilliant writer who needs to be told constantly how brilliant he is. We walk along the pine needle- softened path (led by the cat with the dying mouse in its mouth), until we come to the third gate - this one unmarked. Again we ring. Again Howard's voice leads us: \"Go neither right nor left but straight ahead.\" The pool will be below. Again we obey. Soon we are descending a rocky stair that leads to a dark azure pool and, standing beside it, Prospero himself, an amber sunset whiskey in his hand. Gore is rather more bearish than the last time I saw him, but still handsome, his leonine head beginning to soften with dewlaps, his fiercely intelligent eyes surrounded by innumerable wrinkles. None of this uglifies him. Ageing has only made him more charismatic somehow. You think of Byron at Missolonghi, ravaged by life at 36. But Gore is 75 and has had a good long run of looks, love, fame, fortune. Both life and literature have been good to him - if literature can ever be said to be good to any misunderstood genius. Literature is a mean mistress who always betrays her lovers in the end, refusing promised glories, proffering instead out-of-print books, publishing houses sold to movie studios and television networks, decades of passionately-written novels forgotten as a new generation comes along demanding books written in their own voice. But despite all that, it's been a good run. He was a beautiful young man, a bestselling author at 21 and now, living in splendour like a Renaissance prince, he is still writing at the top of his form. \"If I were a great writer,\" he says, \"I could be living in Brooklyn Heights.\" He is referring to that dinner party I gave for him in New York a few years ago to which Norman Mailer - who lives in Brooklyn Heights - also came. (The two one-time enemies actually broke bread together.) \"But you are a great writer,\" I say. \"I know,\" he says playfully. \"But I'd be even greater if I lived in Brooklyn Heights.\" \"I think Norman's in Provincetown this summer,\" I say. \"Even better!\" Gore roars. \"Maybe I'd be great if I lived in Provincetown.\" I think how odd it is that he should raise his old enmity with Norman. But I know writers - \"ingrown toenails\" as Henry Miller (who preferred to hang out with painters) called us. It is not enough to succeed. All your friends and contemporaries must fail. Writers are like this even when we try like hell not to be. I myself hate that old Hemingwayesque paradigm of the writer as prizefighter and I have tried hard to create an alternate one for myself. When Anne Sexton admonished me, \"We are all writing God's poem,\" I took it to mean there should be no competition between writers because we are all involved in a common project, a common prayer. But to Gore's and Norman's generation, particularly those male writers who served in the second world war, the prizefighter paradigm remains. They still want to KO each other, even at 70-odd. In a way, this is the tragedy of their generation. Their teeth were cut on the war and they never relinquished its us-and-them mentality. Gore tells us about the house. It is a cliff-dwelling, on many levels, and the rock it perches on is so steep that a glance over the balcony from his study gives me instant vertigo. Once owned by the daughter of an English Victorian lord, La Rondinaia has innumerable acres of terraces where grapes, olives and lemons grow, towering cedars, endless steps and balconies above the sea. It is not accessible by automobile. You must walk to this eyrie, an anomaly that has obviously preserved it as one of the most beautiful spots on earth. \"How does it go?\" Gore asks. \"Perfection of the life or of the work? One of the stupidest lines in English poetry. Who was it?\" \"Yeats,\" I said. \"Ridiculous,\" said Gore. \"The truth is you don't have to choose.\" \"Choose what?\" I asked. \"Perfection of the life or of the work. Neither is possible.\" So we wander up the steps to the house and are shown some of it: the hall leading to the salotto with its 17th-century canvases, the salotto itself with its Graeco-Roman head of Zeus and first century mosaic floor mounted as a wallpiece (which cannot be taken out of Italy, says Howard). Gore seems a bit bored with the house tour as if he has done it a few too many times. Howard brings us drinks, complaining of the heat. He and I commiserate about global warming. Then we follow Gore into his study overlooking the sea as if from heaven, the guest suite that might have been ours had we been invited to stay, the terrace overlooking the sea where Sting and Trudie, Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins sang all night at a July 4th party, the grand dining room with its faux-Roman chairs (from the movie set of Ben-Hur), the sitting room with its framed pictures of old pal Princess Margaret. And so at last to sup at the newly refurbished Hotel Sasso, a restored palazzo also hanging over the sea. At the main square in Ravello, Gore is greeted by all and sundry as \"maestro\". An agreeable thing for a famous artist who becomes a habitu\u00e9 of this country is the nod to the maestro that is semi-automatic with Italians. Like Americans, Italians may not read, but they understand that a maestro, even a maestra, is someone to be honoured. If they cannot really distinguish between the brilliance of a Gore Vidal and, say, the pulp of a Danielle Steel, at least they know that a scrittore or scrittrice is a person of consequence. Tongue loosened by many drinks, Gore discusses his plans for his estate. Upon his demise, La Rondinaia will become a study centre for his alma mater, the St Alban's school - but how to administer it? Gore has reached the age of estate-planning. I am all too familiar with this age and also with the cat-and-mouse game benefactors play with their possible heirs. Sitting in the bar for yet another round of drinks before dinner, Gore and Howard opine on what a perfect place the Sasso would be as a retirement home. When the universal condition of life - decay and death - catches up with even the most exalted artists, they succumb to primal fear. I realise I am sitting with an elderly gay couple without children who are facing their declining years with trepidation. They may have plenty of money, a fantastic villa on a promontory of the Italian coast, but they have already experienced a few health scares and they know they are no longer immune to death. That vulnerability is, I think, what makes The Golden Age, Gore's latest novel, so remarkable even in his remarkable oeuvre. He has always been an essayist who fell into the writing of novels and some of his novels seem more essays than novels. But in this one, as in Smithsonian Institution, his last historical fiction, there is an understanding of history and its vicissitudes that no other contemporary writer possesses. Long before anyone else, Gore identified what he dubbed \"The National Security State\", a United States that prepares constantly for war while preaching peace, and nailed its root cause: the need to keep the wheels of commerce turning to the tune of billions of dollars of defence spending per year. Like the 18th-century philosophers who framed the Constitution, he is for a true republic in which the people who participate have some grasp of history. He is outraged by the course the United States has taken in the past 50 years, as indeed the framers of its Constitution would be. Gore sees a Congress bought by special interests, and two parties vying to keep the war machine up and running with American tax dollars. I recently asked Gore what he thought of the-too-close-to-call race between George W Bush and Al Gore, his distant cousin. He replied: \"They are both part of a political system neither of them invented, but Albert is much more intelligent. If you have a bad system, the best thing to do is pick the most intelligent leader. Clearly Al Gore is more intelligent. But the rot goes deep and the system will crumble if we just wait. One big plunge of the stock market could topple the corporate interests that run things.\" Then he talked about his tour through Britain, speaking at Cambridge and Oxford, encountering huge crowds of students everywhere he went. He was impressed by the young people who came to hear him, far less impressed by reviewers of his latest novel who seemed to have no historical education and therefore no context in which to place his fiction. For a writer steeped in Herodotus and Plotinus to be reviewed by those who have read neither must be galling. Gore is at heart an 18th-century man who belongs among those framers of the American Constitution - men who knew their Greek and Roman history and philosophy, and took the long, historical view of governments. His living on a promontory surrounded by ancient artefacts is indeed just what an 18th- century philosopher would do. He lives in splendid isolation - aiming fiery feuilletons at a dumb and dumber world. Gore Vidal understands what America might be if it didn't betray its own ideals - the ideals we gave the world and then renounced in favour of corporate oligarchy and the perpetual war machine. When we said goodbye after dinner and headed back to the sailboat we had anchored on the coast, I was inspired.

Commonly known as mad cow disease, it was first identified in 1986. CJD is the human form of spongiform encephalopathy and is caused by eating beef infected with BSE. <p><b>What causes BSE?</b><br> BSE in the UK comes from using animal feed containing contaminated meat and bone meal as a protein source. Health officials suspect that cattle were contaminated by either scrapie-affected sheep or cattle. Scrapie is a fatal, degenerative disease affecting the central nervous system of sheep and goats.</p> <p><b>What is the likelihood of catching BSE?</b><br> The information keeps changing. In the latest scare, in August this year, Professor John Collinge said that new research showed that animals thought to be healthy and incapable of acquiring BSE can, in theory, pass the disease on. Experiments on mice and hamsters have suggested that similar diseases could jump between species more easily than previously thought. His findings have sparked renewed concern that humans not displaying variant CJD symptoms but incubating the condition may infect others during medical or dental procedures. However, Professor Smith, acting head of the government's BSE advisory comittee SEAC, today said that the risk of becoming infected now from beef products was very small and \"attributable almost certainly to exposure\" when the levels of contaminated product was at its zenith in the food chain.</p> <p><b>How many people have died?</b><br> In total, at least 70 people have died of CJD. Prof Smith said today the final numbers it may yet kill as likely to be from between a few hundred to several thousand people. He said early estimates of an epidemic were \"farily implausible\".</p> <p><b>Has there been a recent outbreak of CJD?</b><br> Health officials are investigating a cluster of five cases around Queniborough, just north of Leicester. These included three victims dying within a few of months in 1998, a fourth who died in May 2000 and another patient, still alive, who is thought to be suffering from the disease.</p> <p><b>Are people still being infected?</b><br> This is what perplexes scientists. Until today's findings, the prevailing scientific opinion was that humans were almost certainly not still being infected. The government's expensive programme of slaughtering all cattle aged over 30 months and - temporarily - banning the sale of beef on the bone minimised public exposure to BSE-infected meat and was thought to have caused the disease to almost die out in Britain's beef herds. But the latest research published by the National Academy of Sciences will cause a rethink.</p> <p><b>What was last week's polio BSE scare about?</b><br> An oral polio vaccine, Medeva, was recalled last week over fears of CJD. The vaccine, which had been used in up to a third of inoculations for children and travellers, contained tiny traces of a feoetal calf growth serum from potentially BSE-contaminated animals. However, the risks of infection from the vaccine were said to be \"incalcuably small\". The Department of Health said the firm, also Medeva, had misled them on assurances the vaccine met new BSE safety guidelines. </p> <p><b>What did the research revealed in August involve?</b><br> Prof Collinge's team found that mice injected with hamster scrapie, a BSE-like disease, carried high levels of infectivity while living into old age without outward symptoms. But when material from the brains of these mice was injected into other mice, it eventually killed them. The worry is that the process created a new strain - or strains - of a more virulent disease.</p> <p><b>Do the latest findings contradict recent information?</b><br> They do seem to go against research released earlier in August when scientists said CJD could ultimately claim 136,000 lives, a much smaller number than previous estimates. At one point there seemed to be no limit to the numbers potentially at risk. A European committee thought that a single animal with BSE could put up to 500,000 people at risk.</p> <p><b>Why were the numbers revised?</b><br> In a report in the journal Nature, scientists from Oxford concluded that any sick animal that entered the food chain was liable to infect no more than two individuals, and only 40% of the population was genetically susceptible, leaving the incubation period as the other key factor. If the incubation period was less than 20 years, there could be as few as 63 cases. If the incubation period stretched to almost lifetime length - 60 years - then there were likely to be 136,000. What matters over the next few years is the annual rate of increases. \"If the average annual incidence of CJD over the next three years is fewer than 15 cases, then the maximum total number of cases would fall to 20,000,\" they wrote.</p> <p><b>How did the Conservative government deal with the BSE crisis?</b><br> Many people think that the issue could have been addressed far earlier. BSE was identified in November 1986 but ministers were not informed about the disease until June 1987. Although measures were subsequently put in place to keep meat most likely to be infected away from the dinner tables, it was not until 1996 that the government admitted that there might be a serious risk to human health. The Labour government launched an official inquiry into the way the crisis was handled.

The service currently has around 500,000 active users. </p> <p>Speaking for the first time about the delays in launching the IC websites, Mr Clarke blamed a number of \"technical issues\". He explained that TMDM had initially picked the wrong content platform, Zip2, last year, which meant having to backtrack and build a whole new platform from scratch in-house. </p> <p>Mr Clarke said that now the new platform was built, it was easy to add on other functionality for new platforms. </p> <p>IcShowbiz, the first 'central portal', has been delayed by a month but should launch in mid-November, followed by icBirmingham and icCoventry at the end of November. December is expected to seen the launch of icSport and a further 13 regional portals. The final 'central portal', icChoice, a lifestyle advice website, is expected to launch in January next year. </p> <p>The new websites are part of Trinity Mirror's \u00a3150m three-year investment in new media revealed in April this year.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Trinity Mirror New Media has appointed Graham Mead, previously managing director of its regional websites, as managing director of the IC Network, the umbrella network that houses the ISP and portal ic24. The appointment coincides with a number of changes at TMNM, including a new name for the division - Trinity Mirror Digital Media. David Clarke, managing director of Trinity Mirror Digital Media, said the developments had come about because the division had grown rapidly and needed a firmer structure. Mr Clarke said: \"It was getting too much for me to manage both elements [the IC Network and group digital strategy] so I needed a good manager to run the IC side of things.\" Mr Mead, formerly regional marketing director of Trinity Mirror, was brought into the digital division in April to head up the planned network of IC-branded regional portals. Having turned around Trinity's Birmingham and Coventry papers in the mid-90s, Mead is viewed as a hard-hitter and commands the respect of staff. He will report directly to Mr Clarke, who is seeking to fill the vacant position of managing director of regional new media by promoting one of the existing six regional directors. Mr Clarke added that he would now be able to take a step back from day-to-day operations to focus on Trinity Mirror's digital strategy and ensure the publisher made the right moves. He said he was keen not to be seen as a copycat with \"me-too\" products for the company's move into new platforms, such as mobile, broadband and digital TV. Mr Clarke added that the free online time ISP initiative would continue for the time being until an unmetered product could be offered next year in conjunction with ic24's current supplier, Cable &amp; Wireless Communications. The service currently has around 500,000 active users. Speaking for the first time about the delays in launching the IC websites, Mr Clarke blamed a number of \"technical issues\". He explained that TMDM had initially picked the wrong content platform, Zip2, last year, which meant having to backtrack and build a whole new platform from scratch in-house. Mr Clarke said that now the new platform was built, it was easy to add on other functionality for new platforms. IcShowbiz, the first 'central portal', has been delayed by a month but should launch in mid-November, followed by icBirmingham and icCoventry at the end of November. December is expected to seen the launch of icSport and a further 13 regional portals. The final 'central portal', icChoice, a lifestyle advice website, is expected to launch in January next year. The new websites are part of Trinity Mirror's \u00a3150m three-year investment in new media revealed in April this year.",

The list of incidents drawn up by TotalFinaElf on behalf of the six main oil companies - obtained by the Guardian - includes bricks, stones and other objects thrown through cab windscreens, tankers cut up or forced off the road, physical attacks and threats to drivers and their families. But although police investigations into some incidents are still being pursued, the TGWU has complained of foot-dragging. Meanwhile, the oil firms' record shows that police were well aware of some incidents but opted for a low-key approach. At Stanlow refinery in Cheshire, for example, where the protests began, the log records: \"Carlton Fuels vehicle had traffic cone thrown through windscreen and air lines disconnected ... following above incident, police advised they could not guarantee driver vehicle safety. All vehicle movements halted\". The failure of police to provide tanker escorts - not only as they left terminals, but at their most vulnerable, when delivering fuel to petrol stations - was a recurrent complaint by drivers during last month's blockades. The TGWU-brokered agreement to allow two drivers per cab and to provide police protection at both pick-up and drop-off points was the key to getting fuel moving out of BP's Grangemouth refinery in central Scotland on September 13, the decisive break in the national blockade. According to a ministerial source, police refused to escort tankers over county lines during last month's protests. But arrangements are now in place to ensure escorts, including police in the cab, will go the whole way if blockades reappear next month.

Lord Justice Pill, sitting with Mr Justice Potts, yesterday ordered that the cases of lifers Anthony Anderson and John Taylor should be heard together as a matter of urgency. The judges said the prisoners' lawyers would argue that the home secretary's powers to set tariffs for retribution and deterrence were \"incompatible\" with the Human Rights Act, which incorporates the European convention on human rights into domestic law. The judges, sitting in London, ordered that similar cases should be put on hold pending the court's decision. Anderson, 38, was sentenced to life at the Old Bailey in 1998 for murdering two men. The trial judge, with the agreement of the lord chief justice, recommended a 15-year tariff after saying Anderson \"picked upon feeble victims\" whom he \"immobilised\" with violence so they could not prevent him stealing from their homes. In July 1997 the home secretary, Jack Straw, increased the minimum term Anderson must serve to 20 years.

      "bodyText": "Opposition MPs yesterday protested that Labour colleagues who both bet on and voted for Michael Martin to become the new Speaker of the Commons were guilty of improper conduct which should be investigated by the parliamentary watchdog. As rumours swept Glasgow and Westminster that sums as high as \u00a3200,000 had been won by MPs getting pro-Martin odds as good as 20-1 when the contest was announced in July, other members insisted that the winnings should at the very least be declared in the register of MPs' interests. Frank Roy, MP for Motherwell and Wishaw, admitted obtaining those odds, but denied placing as much as \u00a3400 with William Hill in Wishaw. \"I am certainly not looking for anything like \u00a37,000 back,\" he told the Daily Record. But other MPs denied any involvement with the bookies on this occasion. One of Glasgow's most colourful backbenchers was rumoured by the Daily Mail to have made \u00a3200,000 on the basis of a \u00a310,000 bet placed with money from a libel settlement with the paper. He denied it. Mr Martin himself, MP for Glasgow Springburn and a teetotaller, told reporters that he had not placed a bet. In similar circumstances, footballers are not allowed to bet on their own games and some MPs - including the Liberal Democrat chief whip, Paul Tyler - took the same view of Monday's election. \"If these bets in any way coloured MPs' judgment of the respective qualities of different candidates for the chair, that is obviously a very serious matter indeed. If it affected the eventual outcome, that must also cause real concern,\" said Mr Tyler, who promised to write to Elizabeth Filkin, parliamentary commissioner for standards. Last night Mrs Filkin's office was refusing all comment until specific complaints were received. William Hill had confirmed that a total of \u00a350,000 had been staked on a Martin win, most of it at odds of 20-1, though not all the bets would have been staked by MPs. Mr Roy, who was campaign manager for Jack McConnell, the Holyrood finance minister, in his attempt to become Scottish first minister, was open about his involvement. He said: \"As far as I am con cerned, if the bookies are daft enough to offer odds like that they deserve to lose the money.\" He denied he had placed a large bet but said: \"I phoned my pals in the pub, and knowing them they would spread the word around.

The proposition is the most radical on the issue of drugs but six other states will be asked to back measures to legalise marijuana for medical use or change the ways in which drug users are treated. Supporters of medical marijuana use say that it helps to alleviate the effects of chemotherapy and Aids. Opponents say that the measures are the thin end of a wedge that would see harder drugs legalised. Voters in 42 states have a total of 204 measures to decide on. If trends of the last decade hold up, roughly half of these measures will pass. Many of the propositions have been drafted with great attention to detail in order not to be deemed to be too vague for enforcement. In Colorado, for instance, a person entitled to medical marijuana would be allowed two ounces and six plants of which three could be flowering. In Massachusetts, the drug proposition would change the civil forfeiture law under which the authorities seize and keep the assets of people convicted of drug offences. Under the proposition the seized money would go to drug rehabilitation projects; it also proposes treatment for low-level first time users. Nevada will again be voting on medical marijuana as its state law requires that such measures achieve a majority vote in two consecutive elections; it got approval in 1998. California will be deciding on whether to have drug offenders treated and put on parole rather than jailed in what is the most controversial and potentially far-reaching proposition on the state's ballots. In Oregon, voters have to decide on 26 proposals, including a ban on promoting or sanctioning homosexual and bisexual behaviour in schools and a ban on the use of \"body-gripping\" animal traps. Nebraska will be voting on gay civil marriages and Colorado on gun restrictions.",

He said the ballot, which is being organised by the United Nations, would produce a \"mono-ethnic result\", referring to an anticipated lack of Serb participation in the vote. His announcement came during a summit of Balkan heads of state in Skopje, Macedonia, designed to welcome the change of administration in Belgrade, and to discuss the future of the region. \"I am not sure that circumstances are such that the product of the elections would be satisfactory,\" he said. \"I think it would be better that these elections [are] postponed.\" The statement is unlikely to be well received among Kosovo's overwhelmingly Albanian population, many of whom see this weekend's polls as a step towards independence. Mr Kostunica's comments were a stark reminder of the problems that face the leaders of region after the fall of Slobodan Milosevic. The summit was organised at short notice by the South Eastern European Cooperation Process, a group which brings together eight Balkan states as well as Turkey. The meeting was also attended by EU foreign policy chief, Javier Solana, who is setting the groundwork for the EU's summit on the Balkans in Zagreb in November. All of the governments stated their desire to see the flow of international aid and investment to the region increased, and stressed their desire for renewed cooperation. A joint statement called for the quick implementation of aid packages agreed to under the stability pact for south-eastern Europe in 1999.

The Crown Prosecution Service, which is seeking a court ruling to that effect, said pre-trial hearings should also be held in secret for \"reasons of national security\". The move was condemned by Mr Shayler and his lawyer, John Wadham, the director of Liberty, the human rights group. \"One of the fundamental principles of our criminal justice system is openness\", Mr Wadham said last night. \"This case is all about freedom of speech and to gag the press from reporting is wrong in principle\". Mr Shayler, who returned voluntarily from France in August to face charges, said: \"Open justice is supposed to be bred in the bone of our common law and trial by our peers in the open, a central tenet of the criminal justice system.\" The move by the CPS comes just days after it served notice that it was seeking a ruling to try in secret Lieutenant Colonel Nigel Wylde, who is accused of supplying information to a journalist about surveillance operations in Northern Ireland. The Guardian intends to appeal against a ruling by the courts to bow to the prosecution's demands in the two cases. It is highly unusual for the prosecution to demand a secrets act trial to be held behind closed doors. During the cold war even spy trials were only partly heard in camera. Mr Shayler is accused of passing information to the Mail on Sunday in 1997 when the newspaper revealed that MI5 held files on prominent Labour leaders and pop musicians. It also made allegations of MI5 incompetence in monitoring the activities of suspected Libyan intelligence officers. Since then, allegations by Mr Shayler about MI6 involvement in a plot to assassinate the Libyan leader, Muammar Gadafy, about MI5's handling of the bombing of the Israeli embassy in London in 1994 and the IRA bombing of Bishopsgate in the City of London the previous year, have been published without government interference. MI5 and MI6 have made it clear that they are concerned about the prospect of more embarrassing information emerging in open court. The indictment against Mr Shayler also covers 60 documents he is alleged to have taken out of MI5 headquarters. However, Mr Wadham said last night: \"There may be some parts of the trial itself that need to be held in secret but not the preliminary hearings and not the whole of the trial.\" Both Mr Shayler and Lt Col Wylde argue that the Official Secrets Act is incompatible with the Human Rights Act because it reverses the burden of proof and does not allow a public interest defence - reasons why Labour opposed the act in opposition in 1989. All prosecutions under the secrets act need the consent of the attorney general, Lord Williams, a keen supporter of the Human Rights Act.",

      "body": "<p>The expression on the face of the silver-haired man spoke volumes. Through the window of the first-class carriage where he would spend the night, he looked as disgruntled as it is possible to be.</p> <p>That was in Glasgow late on Tuesday; very soon similar expressions were to become commonplace across the country.</p> <p>The first hint of what was to come was at around 6pm. Railtrack announced it was imposing a 20mph speed limit on a 40 mile stretch of train track on the west coast mainline south of Law junction, in Lanarkshire. But there was more: from 8am yesterday this crucial arterial route connecting the west coast of Scotland to England would close for the 120 miles between Law and Gretna to allow inspection of the tracks.</p> <p>Almost immediately the fallout began. ScotRail cancelled its Caledonian sleeper services - the speed limit meant the train would not reach Glasgow before the track closure. With 700 passengers booked in, chaos ensued. In a vain attempt to alleviate it, the company first tried to charter an aircraft. When this failed, they began contacting passengers to warn them of the problems. But only a few were cautioned; and passengers arrived at stations in Fort William, Inverness, Aberdeen, Glasgow and London to be told the cross-border trains would not be running.</p> <p>\"It's abysmal the way we've been treated,\" said Alexander Armstrong, from London, who arrived at Glasgow Central to find the 23.25 sleeper service cancelled.</p> <p>\"Passengers should have been contacted rather than turning up at the station and finding out at the last minute.\"</p> <p><b> Scuppered</b><br></p> <p>Stewart Francis, the chairman of the Rail Passengers' Council, concurred. \"You simply can't do this at the last moment. Safety is paramount, we accept that, and if there is a problem then lines must close. But information is the key - give passengers prior warning and at least there is a chance then of taking them with you as we go through what will be a very rocky period indeed.\"</p> <p>There was, at least, some sympathy from passengers for train operators.</p> <p>Alastair McPherson, the managing director of ScotRail, said his best efforts had been scuppered by the late timing of Railtrack's announcement.</p> <p>\"We operate the overnight sleeper services between five points in Scotland and London and we have had two or three hours' notice to make alternative arrangements for our passengers.\"</p> <p>For those arriving at the affected stations on Tuesday night who lived nearby, there was a fleet of taxis to take them home. For those from further afield, there was the offer of a hotel room or a sleeper berth. In London, Glasgow and Edinburgh passengers spent the night in the makeshift hotels of stationary carriages parked on railway sidings.</p> <p>Early yesterday morning many of these passengers were transferred on to the last England-bound train to leave Glasgow Central, becoming among the first to sample the day of disruption.</p> <p>At least 15 trains a day make the journey between Scotland and London, and Virgin Trains operates a string of other services on the west coast mainline.</p> <p>Around 40 services and 15,000 passen gers were directly affected yesterday by Railtrack's decision to close the line. Many thousands more were affected indirectly.</p> <p>Outside Glasgow Central, buses waited to take rail passengers to Carlisle. A journey which would normally take 80 minutes minutes would now last at least three hours.</p> <p>\"It is a totally unacceptable way to treat people,\" said Stephen Leeman, who was travelling to Leeds. Passengers tried to transfer to the east coast line, only to be told it was full. Plane services between Scotland and London filled quickly. The M74 motorway became congested as passengers took to their cars and freight was transferred to lorries.</p> <p>But yesterday's train travel chaos was not confined to Scotland. In the commuter heartland of Milton Keynes, station platforms filled with irate passengers as noticeboards informed of delay after delay. The Milton Keynes to Rugby section of the west coast mainline was severely disrupted. At around 9am yesterday the train station was a picture of havoc: a Virgin train stood stationary at one platform; local services were not moving from others. Passengers fumed as the first service to Gatwick airport was cancelled.</p> <p>\"The platforms were absolutely full: commuters, holidaymakers and parents with children on half-term break,\" said Nick Pandya, a librarian. \"People were, understandably, becoming more and more angry. The station staff seemed unable to manage the crisis and I thought they were going to be lynched at one point.\"</p> <p><b> Emergency timetable</b><br></p> <p>Problems were also to be found further west. Many of Great Western's services to Cornwall were forced on to an emergency timetable as Railtrack imposed a 20mph speed limit between Totnes and Plymouth in Devon. Speed restrictions were brought in in Berkshire and Oxfordshire. For a train operator which has had 14 sections of the track it uses affected by speed limits since Hatfield, it was yet another burden. Great Western said the problems could last for another two weeks.</p> <p>The Midlands, northwest and northeast felt the disruption too as Virgin CrossCountry trains were either cancelled or subject to severe restrictions. Trains from London to the Midlands ran at least an hour late.</p> <p>Services to the northeast from Birmingham through Derby and York were severely delayed. In Anglia, more than 20 separate speed restrictions led to delays of an hour on London to Norwich services. Some trains were cancelled; services south of Colchester in Essex were the worst affected.</p> <p>Such was the scale of yesterday's chaos it made its way in to prime minister's questions. With almost every train operator in Britain reporting problems and hundreds of thousands of passengers facing long delays, Tony Blair told MPs: \"We need to renew our transport infrastructure - but it's a long term project.\"</p> <p>As passengers embarked on their vastly lengthened journeys, Gerald Corbett, the embattled chief executive of Railtrack, put it succinctly.</p> <p>\"It's going to be a difficult week.\"</p>",

When this failed, they began contacting passengers to warn them of the problems. But only a few were cautioned; and passengers arrived at stations in Fort William, Inverness, Aberdeen, Glasgow and London to be told the cross-border trains would not be running. \"It's abysmal the way we've been treated,\" said Alexander Armstrong, from London, who arrived at Glasgow Central to find the 23.25 sleeper service cancelled. \"Passengers should have been contacted rather than turning up at the station and finding out at the last minute.\" Scuppered Stewart Francis, the chairman of the Rail Passengers' Council, concurred. \"You simply can't do this at the last moment. Safety is paramount, we accept that, and if there is a problem then lines must close. But information is the key - give passengers prior warning and at least there is a chance then of taking them with you as we go through what will be a very rocky period indeed.\" There was, at least, some sympathy from passengers for train operators. Alastair McPherson, the managing director of ScotRail, said his best efforts had been scuppered by the late timing of Railtrack's announcement. \"We operate the overnight sleeper services between five points in Scotland and London and we have had two or three hours' notice to make alternative arrangements for our passengers.\" For those arriving at the affected stations on Tuesday night who lived nearby, there was a fleet of taxis to take them home. For those from further afield, there was the offer of a hotel room or a sleeper berth. In London, Glasgow and Edinburgh passengers spent the night in the makeshift hotels of stationary carriages parked on railway sidings. Early yesterday morning many of these passengers were transferred on to the last England-bound train to leave Glasgow Central, becoming among the first to sample the day of disruption. At least 15 trains a day make the journey between Scotland and London, and Virgin Trains operates a string of other services on the west coast mainline. Around 40 services and 15,000 passen gers were directly affected yesterday by Railtrack's decision to close the line. Many thousands more were affected indirectly. Outside Glasgow Central, buses waited to take rail passengers to Carlisle. A journey which would normally take 80 minutes minutes would now last at least three hours. \"It is a totally unacceptable way to treat people,\" said Stephen Leeman, who was travelling to Leeds. Passengers tried to transfer to the east coast line, only to be told it was full. Plane services between Scotland and London filled quickly. The M74 motorway became congested as passengers took to their cars and freight was transferred to lorries. But yesterday's train travel chaos was not confined to Scotland. In the commuter heartland of Milton Keynes, station platforms filled with irate passengers as noticeboards informed of delay after delay. The Milton Keynes to Rugby section of the west coast mainline was severely disrupted. At around 9am yesterday the train station was a picture of havoc: a Virgin train stood stationary at one platform; local services were not moving from others. Passengers fumed as the first service to Gatwick airport was cancelled. \"The platforms were absolutely full: commuters, holidaymakers and parents with children on half-term break,\" said Nick Pandya, a librarian. \"People were, understandably, becoming more and more angry. The station staff seemed unable to manage the crisis and I thought they were going to be lynched at one point.\" Emergency timetable Problems were also to be found further west. Many of Great Western's services to Cornwall were forced on to an emergency timetable as Railtrack imposed a 20mph speed limit between Totnes and Plymouth in Devon. Speed restrictions were brought in in Berkshire and Oxfordshire. For a train operator which has had 14 sections of the track it uses affected by speed limits since Hatfield, it was yet another burden. Great Western said the problems could last for another two weeks. The Midlands, northwest and northeast felt the disruption too as Virgin CrossCountry trains were either cancelled or subject to severe restrictions. Trains from London to the Midlands ran at least an hour late. Services to the northeast from Birmingham through Derby and York were severely delayed. In Anglia, more than 20 separate speed restrictions led to delays of an hour on London to Norwich services. Some trains were cancelled; services south of Colchester in Essex were the worst affected. Such was the scale of yesterday's chaos it made its way in to prime minister's questions. With almost every train operator in Britain reporting problems and hundreds of thousands of passengers facing long delays, Tony Blair told MPs: \"We need to renew our transport infrastructure - but it's a long term project.\" As passengers embarked on their vastly lengthened journeys, Gerald Corbett, the embattled chief executive of Railtrack, put it succinctly. \"It's going to be a difficult week.\"",

Another was the work La R\u00e9volte au S\u00e9rail (1833), which portrayed the inmates of a harem banding together with local working women to overthrow the tyranny of men. It was choreographed by a man, Filippo Taglioni. Spare as most of the entries had to be, some did contain germs of wonderful stories from which we had to drag ourselves away. Before I wrote this dictionary, I had no idea that the dancer and ballet master Leon Espinosa was apparently captured by Indians in 1850 during a tour of north America, nor that the egocentric dancer Louis Duport so incensed the Parisian authorities with his demands that he allegedly escaped their wrath by slipping out of the city disguised as a woman in the company of a former mistress of Napoleon. But these tales will have to wait for another book \u0095 The Oxford Dictionary of Dance is published today, price \u00a325.",

      "byline": "Rupert Smith",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Tonight, while preparing a tasty meal for her tasty boyfriend, Sonia Jackson, aged 15, will go into labour. If this can happen to the most sensible character in EastEnders, then teenage pregnancy must really be getting out of hand. She had it coming, of course - ever since she got lucky with Jamie Mitchell, Fate has been waiting to even the balance - but, generally speaking, Sonia is not the sort of girl to whom these things happen. </p> <p>Sonia Jackson is one of a new breed of young soap mothers. She's intelligent, hard-working, conscientious, and most emphatically not the Town Bike. She allowed Martin Fowler to get a bit carried away earlier in the year, but that's no reflection on her - Martin would probably get carried away with Mo Harris if the lighting was low. Sonia did all the right things - she realised what had happened, confided in an older friend, got a pregnancy test (negative) and then chalked it up to experience. When Jackson Junior arrives tonight, nobody is more surprised than Sonia (although her recent weight gain might have given her a clue). </p> <p>Rewind 13 years to the grim and gritty early years of EastEnders, when soap's most memorable single mother, \"Punk\" Mary Smith, prowled the Square with haystack hair and Siouxsie eye make-up. Mary was old-school: an anti-social runaway who supported baby Annie by stripping and prostitution. Not only was she a single mother, Mary was a bad mother, leaving little Annie home alone while she went out to hustle a few bucks for baby food. The cot blanket caught fire and Albert Square was very nearly one baby down. Mary struggled ineffectually to straighten herself out, but it was no good: she had to go. </p> <p>Less sensational, but equally loaded, was the case of Michelle Fowler. Ostensibly one of soap's sensible girls, Michelle suffered bouts of dementia, during one of which she became pregnant by Den Watts, her best friend's father, and then named the baby Victoria after the pub he ran. Nobody twigged, and Michelle staunchly protected the identity of her mystery baby. She decided to go it alone, an icon of independent young womanhood (apart from the odd furtive session with Dirty Den, who slipped her wads of hush money). This was bold stuff for soaps in the 80s, when single/teenage motherhood was still a semi-shameful subject; Michelle's courage and integrity helped, perhaps, to blow away the last shreds of stigma. </p> <p>\"There's always a balance between a strong storyline and public respon sibility,\" says John Yorke, EastEnders' executive producer. \"Because we have such a massive audience, we know we're contributing to awareness on certain issues, but we try not to be tied down by that. People will soon get fed up if they think they're being preached to, so I'd say we never take a moralistic stance. In the case of Sonia, we wanted to do a storyline about sexual naivety. Sonia was the perfect character for it: she's bright and educated, but ironically she's ignorant about her own body. The shift, I'd say, is that 10 or 15 years ago teenage pregnancy was presented as something that happened to promiscuous girls who went out 'looking for it'. Now it's seen more as a consequence of ignorance. It's harder for anyone to disapprove of that.\" </p> <p>And EastEnders is by no means the first to explore this territory. A few months ago and several miles north, Coronation Street's Sarah-Louise Platt (13) gave birth to baby Bethany, went back to school to complete her education and faced nothing more than a bit of gentle playground teasing. Meanwhile her grandmother Audrey reflected bitterly on her own experience of teenage motherhood, forced by parental pressure to give up her son for adoption. Attitudes have changed even in conservative Weatherfield. The last time Corrie had a single mother - Andrea Clayton, who fell pregnant at 18 after an encounter with Terry Duckworth - her folks were so ashamed that they upped sticks and left the series.

      "bodyText": "Tonight, while preparing a tasty meal for her tasty boyfriend, Sonia Jackson, aged 15, will go into labour. If this can happen to the most sensible character in EastEnders, then teenage pregnancy must really be getting out of hand. She had it coming, of course - ever since she got lucky with Jamie Mitchell, Fate has been waiting to even the balance - but, generally speaking, Sonia is not the sort of girl to whom these things happen. Sonia Jackson is one of a new breed of young soap mothers. She's intelligent, hard-working, conscientious, and most emphatically not the Town Bike. She allowed Martin Fowler to get a bit carried away earlier in the year, but that's no reflection on her - Martin would probably get carried away with Mo Harris if the lighting was low. Sonia did all the right things - she realised what had happened, confided in an older friend, got a pregnancy test (negative) and then chalked it up to experience. When Jackson Junior arrives tonight, nobody is more surprised than Sonia (although her recent weight gain might have given her a clue). Rewind 13 years to the grim and gritty early years of EastEnders, when soap's most memorable single mother, \"Punk\" Mary Smith, prowled the Square with haystack hair and Siouxsie eye make-up. Mary was old-school: an anti-social runaway who supported baby Annie by stripping and prostitution. Not only was she a single mother, Mary was a bad mother, leaving little Annie home alone while she went out to hustle a few bucks for baby food. The cot blanket caught fire and Albert Square was very nearly one baby down. Mary struggled ineffectually to straighten herself out, but it was no good: she had to go. Less sensational, but equally loaded, was the case of Michelle Fowler. Ostensibly one of soap's sensible girls, Michelle suffered bouts of dementia, during one of which she became pregnant by Den Watts, her best friend's father, and then named the baby Victoria after the pub he ran. Nobody twigged, and Michelle staunchly protected the identity of her mystery baby. She decided to go it alone, an icon of independent young womanhood (apart from the odd furtive session with Dirty Den, who slipped her wads of hush money). This was bold stuff for soaps in the 80s, when single/teenage motherhood was still a semi-shameful subject; Michelle's courage and integrity helped, perhaps, to blow away the last shreds of stigma. \"There's always a balance between a strong storyline and public respon sibility,\" says John Yorke, EastEnders' executive producer. \"Because we have such a massive audience, we know we're contributing to awareness on certain issues, but we try not to be tied down by that. People will soon get fed up if they think they're being preached to, so I'd say we never take a moralistic stance. In the case of Sonia, we wanted to do a storyline about sexual naivety. Sonia was the perfect character for it: she's bright and educated, but ironically she's ignorant about her own body. The shift, I'd say, is that 10 or 15 years ago teenage pregnancy was presented as something that happened to promiscuous girls who went out 'looking for it'. Now it's seen more as a consequence of ignorance. It's harder for anyone to disapprove of that.\" And EastEnders is by no means the first to explore this territory. A few months ago and several miles north, Coronation Street's Sarah-Louise Platt (13) gave birth to baby Bethany, went back to school to complete her education and faced nothing more than a bit of gentle playground teasing. Meanwhile her grandmother Audrey reflected bitterly on her own experience of teenage motherhood, forced by parental pressure to give up her son for adoption. Attitudes have changed even in conservative Weatherfield. The last time Corrie had a single mother - Andrea Clayton, who fell pregnant at 18 after an encounter with Terry Duckworth - her folks were so ashamed that they upped sticks and left the series. Sarah-Louise, however, remains firmly in the warm bosom of the family. Trust Brookside to put an absurd spin on the issue. Lindsay Corkhill turned herself into a Merseyside Mildred Pierce to support baby Kylie, now eight. She grafted, she schemed, she ran a nightclub and dreamed of a better life for her daughter until gangsters blew the place sky high. Now Lindsay's learned her lesson and is settling down to respectable single parenthood, ably assisted by Jimmy and Jackie. She has been punished enough. Brookside aside, soaps are happier, fluffier places than they used to be. Sonia's accidental motherhood won't be easy for her, but she won't face crushing social opprobrium every time she wheels the buggy through the Square. In part, this is an accurate reflection of relaxing social attitudes to a whole range of issues - illegitimacy, underage sex, homosexuality, and so on - that were once the cause of tragedy and shame both in real life and in soap. To some extent, soaps have led the way out of the darkness. But without tragedy, shame and melodrama, will we still be gripped as we were in the darker days of the 80s?",

Michael Armstrong, chairman and chief executive of the business, insisted yesterday that the proposals would be good for shareholders. \"Underpinning these changes is ... the foundation for shareholder value.\" Shares in the company were trading just $2 above a year's low of $21.25 yesterday morning after falling more than two-thirds since April. Shareholders have criticised the company for failing to address the problem of the increasingly competitive market for long-distance residential calls in America. At the same time, questions have been raised about whether Mr Armstrong's plan to create a telecommunications powerhouse would prevent the wireless and broadband divisions from growing as fast as they could. AT&amp;T has spent more than $100bn buying between 20 and 30 companies in the cable and broadband sectors since Mr Armstrong took control of the business in 1997. Yesterday he denied that the four-way split represented a strategic about-turn after publicly resisting pressure to split for several months. \"Our strategy has been consistent since we started this journey in 1998,\" he said. In 1997, AT&amp;T's growth businesses, such as wireless, accounted for only about 20% of group revenues, compared to 50% this year, Mr Armstrong said. AT&amp;T announced its acquisition of cable group Media One almost two years ago, a deal which made it the largest cable provider in the US and boosted its ability to supply broadband internet access to consumers and business customers. In spite of these acquisitions, however, its results have been dragged down by limited growth in its more traditional operations. Mr Armstrong denied that the demerger plans had been instigated by John Malone, the head of Liberty Media who sits on AT&amp;T's board. Mr Armstrong, 62, said he intended remain as head of AT&amp;T in order to oversee the demerger - a complicated series of transactions which are expected to take between 12 and 24 months. \"This is quite a task to implement successfully,\" he said. \"I intend to be chairman and chief executive to get this thing done.\" As part of its revamp, AT&amp;T also warned shareholders to expect reduced dividend payouts. The group, which serves more than 80m customers, plans to reorganise its debts and increase its credit facility by about $15bn after its credit rating was downgraded by Moody's recently. 1877 Bell Telephone Company formed by Alexander Graham Bell.

Never have I seen such a harvest of berries- the spikiness of the whitethorn is quite hidden. Time to tackle my autumn walk by Mullaghmore.</p> <p>Grey skies darkened the afternoon, bringing out the contrasting orange, pale yellow and green of the hazel's ribbed leaves. I came into the open, and lovely Mullaghmore mountain rose before me; its terraced steeps, by a quirk of shadow, seemed weightless, fragile, almost ready to take off. The turlough, Lock Gealain (disappearing lake) was full to the brim. I walked on by Teampall Phadraig (Patrick's Temple), by Loch Da Ean (Lake of Two Birds), wondering at the beautiful yellow of the blackthorn leaves. Starlings streamed above.</p> <p>On my return to Mullaghmore I noticed a water garden, bordered by low blackthorn bushes, shrubby cinquefoil, hazel and one spindle-tree, its pink berries dangling, mirrored in clear water, fed by a spring rising gently among moss-covered stones. I have never visited Mullaghmore without coming upon some wonder that fills the heart with gladness. But I came home to anxiety.</p> <p>I looked out at the sea, at the land-spit, the Rine, that tapers out into the Bay. Jo and Sheila Burns' cattle were isolated at the end, the rising tide cutting them off. I phoned an alert but, as the light faded and sea rose, we had to watch the water reach the cattle's knees and then their stomachs. The creatures huddled together, unpanicked; but got safely home at midnight and have been well pampered since.</p>",

Never have I seen such a harvest of berries- the spikiness of the whitethorn is quite hidden. Time to tackle my autumn walk by Mullaghmore. Grey skies darkened the afternoon, bringing out the contrasting orange, pale yellow and green of the hazel's ribbed leaves. I came into the open, and lovely Mullaghmore mountain rose before me; its terraced steeps, by a quirk of shadow, seemed weightless, fragile, almost ready to take off. The turlough, Lock Gealain (disappearing lake) was full to the brim. I walked on by Teampall Phadraig (Patrick's Temple), by Loch Da Ean (Lake of Two Birds), wondering at the beautiful yellow of the blackthorn leaves. Starlings streamed above. On my return to Mullaghmore I noticed a water garden, bordered by low blackthorn bushes, shrubby cinquefoil, hazel and one spindle-tree, its pink berries dangling, mirrored in clear water, fed by a spring rising gently among moss-covered stones. I have never visited Mullaghmore without coming upon some wonder that fills the heart with gladness. But I came home to anxiety. I looked out at the sea, at the land-spit, the Rine, that tapers out into the Bay. Jo and Sheila Burns' cattle were isolated at the end, the rising tide cutting them off. I phoned an alert but, as the light faded and sea rose, we had to watch the water reach the cattle's knees and then their stomachs. The creatures huddled together, unpanicked; but got safely home at midnight and have been well pampered since.",

More than a third of the MPs had signed them. The 57 MDC members cried \"Yes, yes, today is the day!\" and the 92 members of Mr Mugabe's Zanu-PF shouted \"Shame! This is nonsense. A waste of time!\" The impeachment has scant chance of gaining the necessary two-thirds majority, but it will focus attention on Mr Mugabe's record, including his disastrous management of the economy and his incitement of political violence. It is the first time impeachment has been used in Africa against a head of state. \"It shows that the MDC is doing everything it can in parliament and using the law to bring an end to the rule of a dictator,\" one of the party's MPs, Job Sikhala, said. The information minister, Jonathan Moyo, said: \"The MDC has been watching too much television and think they can act like the US Congress did against Bill Clinton. It is pure fantasy to think the president can be impeached. These people are just dreaming of Rhodesia. President Mugabe will not pay any attention to such frivolity.\" A Gallup poll yesterday showed that Mr Mugabe's popularity has plummeted in recent months: 74% of Zimbabweans wanted him to leave office and 51% said he should be put on trial. It showed a collapse of support in the rural areas which were his stronghold until a few months ago. His economic mismanagement, land seizures, violence against the opposition, involvement in the Congo war and rhetoric against whites were rejected by more than 70% of those interviewed in both urban and rural areas. Mr Mugabe responded by hardening his attack on whites, saying he would revoke the policy of racial reconciliation and put the former Rhodesian leader Ian Smith on trial for crimes against humanity during the 1970s war for majority rule. He addressed a band of about 400 supporters, who then marched through Harare and surrounded the House of Assembly, carrying printed placards which declared: \"Impeach the Chief Justice, not our President\", and \"Dissolve Parliament\". They were able to get to the front door of the parliamentary chamber without police hindrance, although similar gatherings of MDC supporters are quickly tear-gassed, beaten and arrested. The impeachment document charges Mr Mugabe with \"willful violation of the constitution\" and \"gross misconduct\". Many MDC supporters want mass action against Mr Mugabe but the party leaders fear that would lead to massacres.",

There can never be a tie. It goes on until there's a zero-sum result - unlike the election, which must end on November 7 and could produce any one of eight results. Gore could be president, with an all-Republican Congress, an all-Democrat Congress, a Congress split between Democratic House and Republican Senate, or just possibly vice versa. Bush faces the same permutations. Though some outcomes are more likely than others, none can be ruled out. Entering its own final stretch, the contest is too close to call. It's also, however, as unlike war as politics can ever be. Whole armies have not engaged. To the combatants it is everything. But many voters confess to the bewildered paralysis of people who think it doesn't matter.</p> <p>It began as a battle that did matter. Gore's convention speech promised a stark left-right election. There are still traces of that, in some clear differences over social security spending and tax cuts. While one man denounces big government, the other promises active government. But the blurring is intense. Bush, after all, would have to come to Washington and abandon his puerile pretence that the infamous city can be written out of the script. Gore is now insisting he wouldn't appoint a single extra federal employee. The centre beckons, and the politics of maximum inoffensiveness in search of elusive voters who can't yet persuade themselves the journey to the polling-booth is worth making.</p> <p>Trivia, therefore, reigns. This is less a political battle than a beauty contest. Who has the cuter smile? Which looks you more warmly in the eye? Which is the more likeable ? Never mind the competence, let alone the healthcare details - who would you rather have at the barbecue cook-out? Because from likeability comes trust , does it not? And from trust, the reassurance that this guy will do the right thing, whatever that might be. The verdict on the three Gore-Bush debates was that because Gore was superior in every sense, he had lost them, and maybe the election too.</p> <p>Why have things come to this? Three groups collude to produce it. First, the electorate, and its crisis of contentment. For many tens of millions of Americans, including the majority of the 50% likely to vote, there are no agonising existential choices. They think they don't have to confront anything serious that public men can do much about. They are having a good time. Smiles and body-language are attractions they can therefore indulge. Why not give the other side a chance? There can't be much to lose.</p> <p>Second, the candidates themselves, two dynastic dilutees. The juice is running out of the line. Gore is the son of a father who was a political hero of his time, a Tennessee senator of convictions, about Vietnam especially, which he would not surrender. Bush is the son of a president who was schooled for the highest office as well as any man who held it. Both current incumbents of the names are, by comparison, cyphers: calculating, unheroic, uninspired and, in Bush's case, the empty vessel into which Big Oil and the National Rifle Association have poured enough to guarantee they hold the public interest to ransom if they get the right result.</p> <p>Third, there are people like me, the commentators in thrall to the reality they see, amplifiers of this trivia, submitters to a zeitgeist they can't escape, compulsive expounders of the thesis that smiles matter, hauteur is deplorable, earnestness an anachronism, policy competence a burden. They may not like this. They compare it with better days, like Nixon/Kennedy or even Carter/Reagan. But they become part of the static that legitimises it. Because every poll says that likeable matters most, every writer has to say that George W Bush is proving an extraordinarily strong candidate for president and commander-in-chief of the US.</p> <p>The big loser from this tendency is, of course, Al Gore. He doesn't meet the new tests of showbiz politics, yet has so far failed to wrest the election back to the agendas that once counted for everything. This will mark an astounding historic record, if Gore loses. There will never have been a failure like it.</p> <p>Having been party to creating the contentment, Gore is unable to own it. The economic triumphs of Bill Clinton become an albatross round his neck. The test that used to be decisive - are most Americans better off after eight years of the incumbent party? - no longer figures. It is not only the times that have imposed this degeneration. It is the candidate, who has not imposed the terms of political trade he inherited, and has thus fortified the delusion that the result matters less than the outcome of the World Series.</p> <p>Whichever of the eight results happens in two weeks' time, it will matter hugely. If Bush becomes president, however close the call, America will have voted for change. That's how it will be seen. A new era will begin to get its name. After Clinton, Bush. It may come down to only a couple of precincts in Chicago, the ones they always said Kennedy stole to beat Nixon, but the name on the trophy will be definitive.</p> <p>It will bring a lot of consequences. Not just a style and a name and a fearsome collection of interest-groups awaiting their reward for the costliest campaign in history, but, actually, an ideology which, at the edge, favours the rich over the poor, the gunmen over the unarmed, the law of the jungle over the laws of men, and a supreme court that will make such biases come to pass. In foreign affairs, as I wrote on Tuesday, the change of trajectory is set to be much sharper.</p> <p>Can America, sleepwalking agreeably towards this, be made to care? In a tight race, for the remains of an apolitical electorate, much can still happen to change a few minds. In the land of trivia, the most trivial error could swing it. Bush is more capable than Gore of saying something stupid that makes fickle minds think again about the guy around the barbecue. Nothing, though, will match the ball game, to which I will tonight repair for a glimpse of the old testosterone.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:hugoyoung@compuserve.com\">hugoyoung@compuserve.com</a></p>",

The test that used to be decisive - are most Americans better off after eight years of the incumbent party? - no longer figures. It is not only the times that have imposed this degeneration. It is the candidate, who has not imposed the terms of political trade he inherited, and has thus fortified the delusion that the result matters less than the outcome of the World Series. Whichever of the eight results happens in two weeks' time, it will matter hugely. If Bush becomes president, however close the call, America will have voted for change. That's how it will be seen. A new era will begin to get its name. After Clinton, Bush. It may come down to only a couple of precincts in Chicago, the ones they always said Kennedy stole to beat Nixon, but the name on the trophy will be definitive. It will bring a lot of consequences. Not just a style and a name and a fearsome collection of interest-groups awaiting their reward for the costliest campaign in history, but, actually, an ideology which, at the edge, favours the rich over the poor, the gunmen over the unarmed, the law of the jungle over the laws of men, and a supreme court that will make such biases come to pass. In foreign affairs, as I wrote on Tuesday, the change of trajectory is set to be much sharper. Can America, sleepwalking agreeably towards this, be made to care? In a tight race, for the remains of an apolitical electorate, much can still happen to change a few minds. In the land of trivia, the most trivial error could swing it. Bush is more capable than Gore of saying something stupid that makes fickle minds think again about the guy around the barbecue. Nothing, though, will match the ball game, to which I will tonight repair for a glimpse of the old testosterone. hugoyoung@compuserve.com",

The Austrian president, Thomas Klestil, called Ms Whiteread's \"nameless library\" - a hermetically-sealed room of books to symbolise the large numbers of victims and the untold stories of their lives - an attempt to \"describe the indescribable\". Acknowledgment Mayor of Vienna, Michael Haupl, said it was \"necessary for Austria\", and was meant to \"send a message to the world\", from a country which for years has painted itself as a victim of Hitler, rather than a perpetrator of nazi crimes. The unveiling comes at a sensitive time for the alpine republic as it desperately tries to repair its tarnished reputation following the entry into a coalition government of Jorg Haider's far right Freedom party (FPO) almost nine months ago. Sanctions imposed by the European Union in response were only lifted last month, leaving Austria humiliated. Jewish visitors from around the world were invited to view the unveiling along with representatives from government and the Catholic Church, but the FPO was noticeable by its absence. Asked if she had any contact with the party, Ms Whiteread, 37, replied: \"I've never met Haider and I hope that I never do.\" She said she was \"very relieved and happy\" finally to see her work which almost failed to see the light of day. The 1994 Turner prize winner received the commission to create the monument in January 1996. Nameless Library was originally to be unveiled on November 9 of the same year, the 58th anniversary of the Kristallnacht anti-Jewish attacks. But heated debates cut across Vienna's political and religious landscape and split the Jewish community, delaying its completion. Construction of the monument ground to a halt when excavation work on the square unearthed the ruins of a synagogue destroyed in 1421. A campaign of violent persecution by the Catholic Church had led dozens of Jews to commit suicide inside the synagogue, rather than renounce their faith.

But the artist stood her ground, threatening to sue the council. \"I designed the memorial for Judenplatz and if it is to be moved elsewhere a new competition has to be launched,\" she said. After lengthy negotiations the archeological findings and the monument were allowed to co-exist on the square and the project was completed earlier this year. Judenplatz has been pedestrianised to provide an atmosphere of relative calm and its chronicle of the persecution of Austria's Jews now includes access to the remains of the synagogue and a Judaic centre for the ultra-orthodox Misrachis. In his speech President Klestil stressed the \"ambivalence of our history\", pointing out that at times the Jews had prayed peacefully in Judenplatz, and in house No 244, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart composed Cosi Fan Tutti in 1783. He also stressed his country's recent attempts to right the wrongs of its past after Monday's signing of an agreement to set up a 6bn schilling (\u00a3260m) fund to compensate the survivors of Nazi forced labour. But he admitted such measures should have happened years ago. Roots A Latin inscription on a plaque from 1497 at the far end of the square stating that the Jews deserved the fate that befell them, recalled the anti-Semitism in which the Holocaust had its roots. It was not until 1500 that Jews were allowed to settle in Vienna on payment of a poll tax. But they were repeatedly expelled until the 18th century. The president of the Jewish community, Ariel Muzicant, said the monument marked hundreds of years of anti-Semitism in Vienna, but the main concern should be: \"What happened after 1945?

Only fragments of the aircraft were found, scattered over a charred expanse of land. \"After such a powerful explosion, it is unlikely that any of the passengers could have survived. But the rescue operation is nevertheless continuing,\" a spokesman for the local emergency services said. Marina Ryklina, a spokeswoman for Russia's emergency situations ministry, said the plane crashed about 15 miles east of the capital. A Georgian politician, Georgy Targamadze, put the site of the accident near the small town of Kabuleti, at the foot of the Mkirala mountain. The plane was flying from Chkalovskoye, a town outside Moscow which hosts a military airfield, to Batumi, also home to a Russian military base. Georgia gained independence with the break up of the Soviet Union in 1991, but Russia still maintains some troops in the region. The military is in the process of removing its soldiers and equipment from two bases in Georgia, and is negotiating withdrawal from two more. Equipment from the bases is being shipped out through Batumi.",

In 1993, the House of Lords ruled in the case of the Hillsborough survivor, Tony Bland, that doctors could stop feeding PVS patients.</p> <p>That ruling had to be reconsidered in the light of the act, which incorporates the European convention on human rights, with its guarantee of the right to life.</p> <p>On October 8, Dame Elizabeth ruled that feeding could be withdrawn from the two patients, named only as Mrs M and Mrs H.</p> <p>Giving her reasons yesterday, she concluded that the Lords' ruling in the Bland case did not conflict with the European convention.</p> <p>Article 2 of the convention, the right to life, obliges the state to refrain from taking life intentionally and also imposes a positive obligation on the state to safeguard life.</p> <p>Dame Elizabeth said: \"Although the intention in withdrawing artificial nutrition and hydration in PVS cases is to hasten death, in my judgment the phrase 'deprivation of life' must import a deliberate act, as opposed to an omission, by someone acting on behalf of the state, which results in death.\"</p> <p>She said a \"responsible decision\" by a medical team not to provide treatment at the initial stage could not amount to intentional deprivation of life. Mrs H, aged 36, was visiting the US last year when she suffered an attack of pancreatitis caused by medication for epilepsy.</p> <p>She returned to England but had a heart attack, depriving her brain of oxygen, when she was in hospital undergoing treatment in January this year.</p> <p>Mrs M, 49, was brain-damaged in 1997 as a result of an anaesthetic accident during gynaecological surgery.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The two severely brain-damaged patients who were at the centre of a high court \"right to life\" test case three weeks ago have died peacefully, lawyers for the hospitals which treated them said yesterday. The announcement came 19 days after Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, president of the high court's family division, gave doctors the go-ahead to withdraw tube feeding after hearing that both women were suffering the \"living death\" of a permanent vegetative state. The case went before England's top family judge to test the effect of the new Human Rights Act on the right of doctors to withdraw artificial feeding in such cases. In 1993, the House of Lords ruled in the case of the Hillsborough survivor, Tony Bland, that doctors could stop feeding PVS patients. That ruling had to be reconsidered in the light of the act, which incorporates the European convention on human rights, with its guarantee of the right to life. On October 8, Dame Elizabeth ruled that feeding could be withdrawn from the two patients, named only as Mrs M and Mrs H. Giving her reasons yesterday, she concluded that the Lords' ruling in the Bland case did not conflict with the European convention. Article 2 of the convention, the right to life, obliges the state to refrain from taking life intentionally and also imposes a positive obligation on the state to safeguard life. Dame Elizabeth said: \"Although the intention in withdrawing artificial nutrition and hydration in PVS cases is to hasten death, in my judgment the phrase 'deprivation of life' must import a deliberate act, as opposed to an omission, by someone acting on behalf of the state, which results in death.\" She said a \"responsible decision\" by a medical team not to provide treatment at the initial stage could not amount to intentional deprivation of life. Mrs H, aged 36, was visiting the US last year when she suffered an attack of pancreatitis caused by medication for epilepsy. She returned to England but had a heart attack, depriving her brain of oxygen, when she was in hospital undergoing treatment in January this year. Mrs M, 49, was brain-damaged in 1997 as a result of an anaesthetic accident during gynaecological surgery.",

In 1997, Palumbo lent Mandelson a chauffeured car. Now the MoS is getting the Dome strangely free of charge. That's one helluva coincidence. That's just the sort of cynicism that damaged the Dome . What will the critics say? They are being unusually supportive. Shadow culture secretary Peter Ainsworth has said: \"If there is to be a party, I would rather it was organised by the Ministry of Sound than the Ministry of Culture.\" That's a bit tough on Chris \"havin' it large\" Smith: You clearly didn't spend last New Year's Eve in the waiting room at Stratford station. Do say: \"At last a party worth voting for.\" Don't say: \"Any chance of booking the Corrs again?\"",

Yesterday Robin Gibson, curator of the National Portrait Gallery exhibition, said: \"The irony is that 16 years later Charles Saatchi is acknowledged to be one of the strongest forces in the contemporary art market in Britain, and the painting looks increasingly like one of the most memorable images of Margaret Thatcher ever produced.\" Mr Gibson has chosen one painting to represent each year from 1900 to 2000, beginning with a monumentally glum Queen Victoria. The portraits include many of the most celebrated images of the century, including Andy Warhol's double portrait of a gun toting Elvis Presley.",

The company's subsidiary, Carlton Sales, will take over selling airtime for SMG's Scottish and Grampian ITV subsidiaries on January 1 as part of a five-year deal. The agreement gives Carlton control of ITV's advertising revenue and means it will be responsible for almost \u00a31bn of annual advertising income. Carlton will take over from TSMS the sale of Scottish and Grampian airtime. TSMS is the former United News &amp; Media sales house that is being merged with Granada Sales following the \u00a31.75m sale of United's ITV businesses to Granada Media. The merger and loss of the SMG contract will lead to 100 job losses at the combined TV sales house, Granada confirmed yesterday. SMG was able to renegotiate its TV sales business under office of fair trading rules laid down before the alliance between Granada and United. In order to get the merger cleared by regulators, Granada gave an undertaking that it would free the smaller ITV franchises from their existing TSMS airtime sales contracts. TSMS had been handling the Scottish and Grampian accounts since 1994 and the existing deal was due to run until the end of 2002. Donald Emslie, SMG's managing director, said that the company held \"thorough and extensive discussions\" with both Carlton Sales and Granada Sales before awarding the sales contract to the former. \"We went with Carlton because of the deal that they offered in commercial terms and the services they could provide,\" he added. He continued: \"This is good news for ITV and advertisers, creating a balance in the market place between two equally strong sales houses.\" SMG's total TV advertising revenues in 1999, the last full year reported, were just under \u00a3120m, with Scottish and Grampian accounting for 6.1% of ITV's net advertising revenue in that year. Carlton Sales managing director Steve Platt said: \"Adding the Scottish stations to the Carlton stable gives us a stronger sell with a wider reach. HTV and the Scottish stations together bring an other 9m people into the Carlton sell.\" The cuts in the combined Granada Media airtime sales arm will be made by January, with some staff being asked to reapply for their jobs. Granada took over ownership of TSMS on October 4. Staff from TSMS will be moved from the company's west London base in Hanger Lane to Granada's headquarters in Grays Inn Road. Lorna Tilbian, analyst at WestLB Panmure, said she was unsurprised by yesterday's developments. A central thrust of SMG's strategy, she said, has been to maintain its independence from Granada Media, which sits on an 18% stake of the company. Granada Media caused a stir last year when SMG said it was interested in buying radio group Ginger Media. Yesterday's deal makes a merger of equals of Carlton and Granada Media more likely in two years' time when legislation allowing further consolidation in ITV is passed, Ms Tilbian said.",

Is this really what the government wants to encourage - high risk with no benefits whatsoever to the balance sheets of UK companies?\" Mr Cruickshank asked. He estimated that the total loss of trading by 2003 would be \u00a31 trillion, the equivalent of 70% of the total value of shares traded last year. \"The UK is the only major financial market with such a tax. Great care should be taken not to take for granted the UK equity market's ability to cope with the extra cost. \"Patience is not inexhaustible and it is essential to remember that once markets are lost they are almost impossible to recapture.\" Mr Cruickshank listed stamp duty as one of five strategic issues facing the stock exchange. The others were the lack of a single market for financial services in Europe; fragmentation of the behind-the-scenes clearing and settlement services; better regulation and a lack of reciprocity between the United States and Europe over allowing access to each other's markets.",

      "body": "<p>T hink about the far reaches of the solar system, where Uranus, Neptune and Pluto orbit. Is there any reason why it should suddenly stop? Why shouldn't there be other planets - even if only small ones - at the periphery of the solar system? </p> <p>Ever since Pluto was spotted in 1930 people have speculated about a Planet X, a tenth planet awaiting identification. Part of the reasoning was that Uranus and Neptune, discovered in 1781 and 1846 respectively, seemed to have slight wobbles in their motions around the Sun. Perhaps they were being perturbed by the gravitational tugs of one or more large unseen planets. We knew Pluto was too small to be the culprit, leading to a widespread belief in Planet X. </p> <p>This idea was based on a false premise. When Nasa's Voyager 2 spacecraft flew past Uranus in 1986, and then Neptune in 1989, accurate radio tracking of how its path was deviated by the gravity of those planets enabled space researchers to derive more precise values for their masses. It turned out that the previous evaluations were out by a few parts in a thousand, and the apparent wobbles disappeared from the theoretical modelling. </p> <p>A massive Planet X was ruled out in 1992. But late in the same year a small planet was found beyond Pluto. The discovery, by a team led by David Jewitt of the University of Hawaii, was not unexpected. </p> <p>If our models for the formation of the planets is correct, with a gradual build up of massive bodies from collisions and amalgamations between smaller lumps, then we would expect residual building blocks to remain beyond Neptune. </p> <p>For decades astronomers had argued that Pluto was simply the largest and consequently the brightest of the lumps left at the edge. In the early 1950s the Dutch-Ameri can astronomer Gerard Kuiper had hypothesised that there should be thousands of these in a band at the periphery of the solar system. This was dubbed the Kuiper belt even before the first member was found. </p> <p>Recently it was recognised that Irish astronomer Kenneth Edgeworth independently suggested this in the late 1940s, so researchers started to call it the Edgeworth-Kuiper belt. Now, historical digging has shown that in 1930, just a few months after Pluto was spotted, University of Chicago astronomer Frederick Leonard published a paper in which he suggested that Pluto was not alone. </p> <p>It is not clear whether Leonard understood just how crowded the region happens to be. Right now - less than eight years since Jewitt found the first trans-Neptunian object - the box score stands at 288 minor planets way out there in the belt, with more being added every week. These bodies are so far away that it takes light several hours to reach us after being reflected by their surfaces. </p> <p>Pluto is small by planetary standards, only about 1,500 miles across. It has a natural satellite, Charon, which was discovered in 1978 and is about half Pluto's size. The horde of independent bodies now known range in diameter from about 60 up to several hundred miles, although those are simply educated guesses based upon how much sunlight they reflect. </p> <p>Astronomers have been amazed at the different patterns demonstrated by these new-found minor planets. For example, many seem to have orbital periods (the time taken to complete a circuit about the Sun) which are simple multiples of that of Neptune. They complete two orbits for every three of Neptune, or three for every four of Neptune, and so on. This was not unexpected (a similar effect ensures that Pluto cannot collide with Neptune although their orbits cross), but it does indicate that something systematic is going on. </p> <p>A different population of objects in the outer solar system is called the Centaurs. The first Chiron, was found in 1977. Since then several dozen have been found, ranging up to a couple of hundred miles in size. Some show signs of cometary activity, such as gaseous constituents being released as they come slightly closer to the Sun. Thus it is thought that these are, in common with the trans-Neptunian objects, really giant comets - bundles of ice and rock - largely inert simply because the environment is so cold where they orbit. </p> <p>The Centaurs have trajectories that make close approaches to the outer planets feasible. Such approaches may result in an impact, but more likely would be an alteration of the Centaur orbit around the Sun. Because of this they are unstable, with gross dynamical changes being inevitable.

      "bodyText": "T hink about the far reaches of the solar system, where Uranus, Neptune and Pluto orbit. Is there any reason why it should suddenly stop? Why shouldn't there be other planets - even if only small ones - at the periphery of the solar system? Ever since Pluto was spotted in 1930 people have speculated about a Planet X, a tenth planet awaiting identification. Part of the reasoning was that Uranus and Neptune, discovered in 1781 and 1846 respectively, seemed to have slight wobbles in their motions around the Sun. Perhaps they were being perturbed by the gravitational tugs of one or more large unseen planets. We knew Pluto was too small to be the culprit, leading to a widespread belief in Planet X. This idea was based on a false premise. When Nasa's Voyager 2 spacecraft flew past Uranus in 1986, and then Neptune in 1989, accurate radio tracking of how its path was deviated by the gravity of those planets enabled space researchers to derive more precise values for their masses. It turned out that the previous evaluations were out by a few parts in a thousand, and the apparent wobbles disappeared from the theoretical modelling. A massive Planet X was ruled out in 1992. But late in the same year a small planet was found beyond Pluto. The discovery, by a team led by David Jewitt of the University of Hawaii, was not unexpected. If our models for the formation of the planets is correct, with a gradual build up of massive bodies from collisions and amalgamations between smaller lumps, then we would expect residual building blocks to remain beyond Neptune. For decades astronomers had argued that Pluto was simply the largest and consequently the brightest of the lumps left at the edge. In the early 1950s the Dutch-Ameri can astronomer Gerard Kuiper had hypothesised that there should be thousands of these in a band at the periphery of the solar system. This was dubbed the Kuiper belt even before the first member was found. Recently it was recognised that Irish astronomer Kenneth Edgeworth independently suggested this in the late 1940s, so researchers started to call it the Edgeworth-Kuiper belt. Now, historical digging has shown that in 1930, just a few months after Pluto was spotted, University of Chicago astronomer Frederick Leonard published a paper in which he suggested that Pluto was not alone. It is not clear whether Leonard understood just how crowded the region happens to be. Right now - less than eight years since Jewitt found the first trans-Neptunian object - the box score stands at 288 minor planets way out there in the belt, with more being added every week. These bodies are so far away that it takes light several hours to reach us after being reflected by their surfaces. Pluto is small by planetary standards, only about 1,500 miles across. It has a natural satellite, Charon, which was discovered in 1978 and is about half Pluto's size. The horde of independent bodies now known range in diameter from about 60 up to several hundred miles, although those are simply educated guesses based upon how much sunlight they reflect. Astronomers have been amazed at the different patterns demonstrated by these new-found minor planets. For example, many seem to have orbital periods (the time taken to complete a circuit about the Sun) which are simple multiples of that of Neptune. They complete two orbits for every three of Neptune, or three for every four of Neptune, and so on. This was not unexpected (a similar effect ensures that Pluto cannot collide with Neptune although their orbits cross), but it does indicate that something systematic is going on. A different population of objects in the outer solar system is called the Centaurs. The first Chiron, was found in 1977. Since then several dozen have been found, ranging up to a couple of hundred miles in size. Some show signs of cometary activity, such as gaseous constituents being released as they come slightly closer to the Sun. Thus it is thought that these are, in common with the trans-Neptunian objects, really giant comets - bundles of ice and rock - largely inert simply because the environment is so cold where they orbit. The Centaurs have trajectories that make close approaches to the outer planets feasible. Such approaches may result in an impact, but more likely would be an alteration of the Centaur orbit around the Sun. Because of this they are unstable, with gross dynamical changes being inevitable. It is even possible that one could fall into the inner solar system. That would produce a phenomenal comet. Hale-Bopp, seen by many people four years ago, had a solid core about 25 miles across deep within its gaseous cloud and tail. A good-sized Centaur coming in to cross the Earth's orbit would be much, much brighter, and there are historical records that seem to speak of such events. Using the new generation of large telescopes on mountain s in Hawaii, Chile and the Canary Islands astronomers are finding that space is far from empty. Pluto may be far away, but it is not alone. It is accompanied by thousands of little Plutinos, the existence of which we are only just beginning to map out. \u0095 Duncan Steel researches asteroids and comets at the University of Salford .",

We use it to retrieve a note or record one that we'll use later. We hold it in one hand and enter text with another, and we use it in a public environment, for as short a time as possible. A foot device, like a computer, is where we work with the information we may have recorded on the inch device. It's where we'll actually manipulate our database of contacts, or write the article using the names of user-test ing companies we gathered on the Palm. Yard devices, like televisions and video projectors, are used to present or collaborate about this information with others. Obvious? So then why are wireless companies attempting to shrink the web, through Wap, onto tiny cell phone screens? Don't they know the web was designed for the foot-scaled computer screen, and not a two-line text-only inch device? Apparently not, which is why anyone who has tried to do what one might actually want to do through the internet on a cell phone - like check email or a stock quote - is suffering through dozens of keystrokes and nested screens rather than the simplicity of true inch-scale interfaces, such as those on Palm or Rim devices. It's the same sort of mistake that dozens of streaming media companies have made: believing that the computer screen is a proper place to watch feature length movies. They are mistakenly broadcasting yard-scale media through a foot device. That's why they're all going out of business. This is not rocket science. It's merely a subtle shift in how to think about making new media decisions. Bring your technology to the human being, and not the other way around.",

If it succeeds, it should boost e-business everywhere - especially between small companies, and in the Third World. </p> <p>Through UN/CEFACT the UN has been the major force behind the Edifact (Electronic data interchange for administration, commerce and transport) standard. But while UN/Edifact has been successful, it has not taken over in the American market - many US companies still use their own X12 standard - and it has been too expensive for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Klaus-Dieter Naujok, chairman of UN/CEFACT, is keen to redress this with a new standard called ebXML. </p> <p>On a visit to London last week Naujok, from San Francisco, was accompanied by Ray Walker, Britain's e-trade guru, DTI advisor, and chair of the UN/CEFACT steering group. They had contrasting styles - Naujok jokey and outgoing, Walker more quietly-spoken - but the same message, and the tendency to finish one another's points that comes from working in tandem. </p> <p>\"We did something for the big companies with Edifact, and that goes on. But it's vitally important that we get the SMEs involved, and that's much more appreciated in the developing countries than it is here.

It's a huge step forward in opening those markets up and enabling those countries to participate in world trade,\" added Walker. </p> <p>The UN's initiative is based on XML, the eXtensible Markup Language backed by Tim Berners-Lee's World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). When Berners-Lee invented the web, the aim was to provide a simple way of sharing texts and pictures across many different types of computer: HTML (HyperText Markup Language) did that. Now companies need to move structured data around - the kind stored in spreadsheets, databases, and accounts packages. XML does that. </p> <p>For real electronic trading, the data also has to be identified and presented so that a machine can read it, and process it. This is not the same as, for example, phoning in a purchase order, or putting the details in an email message. That may be e-commerce, but it usually depends on having a person to accept and probably retype the data at the other end. </p> <p>In an electronic trading system, a computer could place a purchase order with the supplier's computer (perhaps when prompted by a stock control system) and make the payment without a person being involved at either end. </p> <p>That is already possible using Edifact, but it is used mainly by large companies across dedicated networks or Vans (value-added network services). With XML, small companies will be able to do their electronic trading cheaply \"over the internet in a secure way. That's the most important part\", said Naujok. </p> <p>XML, which first emerged in 1996, is rapidly becoming an important open standard. Its leading backers include three major rivals, IBM, Microsoft, and Sun Microsystems. Indeed, Microsoft is basing its whole future strategy, called .Net, on XML. </p> <p>But the problem with XML, quipped Ray Walker, \"is that it's extensible. There are three or four hundred different purchase orders out there in XML format. Businesses don't want that: they want one way of going forward.\" So for global electronic trading, businesses must not only use a common language, they must also standardise their data sets and interfaces to provide interoperability. If ebXML takes off, there could be a single XML standard for business, instead of hundreds. </p> <p>Traditionally, big businesses wrote or customised their own software to handle what they perceived as their unique business needs. Wal-Mart would neither know nor care how Marks &amp; Spencer generated purchase orders. That is why the UN project is using business processes as building blocks, rather than terminology, which varies between firms. \"It's a big thing for Wal-Mart to use the same data set as M&amp;S, but we should distinguish between the internal implementation and what it takes to exchange information. At that level there is more commonality than people like to admit.\" </p> <p>Obviously not every company can be involved with defining ebXML, but UN/CEFACT is working in partnership with Oasis, the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards, and numerous industry bodies.

      "body": "<p>ET got it wrong. These days, any sensible stranded alien would have only one thing to say: PC, phone home. </p> <p>Internet telephony, or VOIP (voice over internet protocol), is hot. Suddenly, as bandwidth, chip power and applications have improved, personal computers are being turned into what technology pundit Robert X Cringely has jokingly called \"the world's most expensive telephone\". </p> <p>Yesterday's geeky hobbyist pastime, complete with terrible sound quality, echoing lines, and silly headsets, is today's intelligent way of ducking high international phone rates. The line quality can equal that of a good mobile phone connection, you can dial from your PC to someone's phone, rather than having to prearrange a time for a PC to PC call using headsets, and several companies have begun to bring out special netphone devices. </p> <p>\"The reason it's taking off is that processor speeds have increased significantly and bandwidth has improved,\" says Larry Spear, a co-founder of Go2call, a company that lets individuals place PC to phone or PC to PC calls from the web. Calls to the US, Canada, and many European countries are free. \"Our network architecture translates into extremely low costs. Our advertisers are willing to pay for the cost of calls,\" says Spear. </p> <p>Like many online telephony companies, Go2call began by offering \"arbitrage\" - cheap long-distance callcard services. This remains one element of the business, but Go2call is running full-speed after the net telephony market, cutting deals with ZDnet to offer its service to users, for example, and establishing a network of sites around Europe, includ ing the UK and Ireland. </p> <p>The company's own private IP network enables it to offer a higher-quality service than some competitors that run calls entirely over the problem and delay-prone public internet. A caller dials from the Go2call.co.uk website using a small Java applet, which routes the call to a gateway that transfers it to the company's own fibre lines. \"We connect into the major internet backbones and get your call off the public internet as quickly as possible,\" Spear says. Callers can experience some slight delay that causes one speaker to overlap with another, but in an era of fuzzy mobile lines and dropped calls, many people are happy to trade off some loss of line quality for the free service. </p> <p>But ringing mother at negligible cost from your Dell is only a small part of a very big picture. According to analysts, the technology behind VOIP is about to transform the telephony scene for both consumers and businesses. The end result will be a universe in which all types of digital data can merge - voice, video, text, the web. Wireless and land-line networks also will blend. People will be offered a smorgasbord of new applications and services for communication and entertainment that bring audio and video together over television, PCs, mobiles, and new connectivity devices like netphones that mate full-size handsets and viewing screens. </p> <p>\"The market has really matured in the last year,\" says Susan Thomson, an analyst with Dataquest/Gartner Group. She is quick to emphasise that, except for a few small consumer companies targeting home PC users, VOIP does not involve sending calls out over the public internet. IP is simply a protocol for transferring information over any digital network - in this case, fibre cables used by telecommunications carriers - using an efficient method that also is used on the public internet. \"This is not just a new technology,\" she says. \"It's the way that voice is going to be carried and the big carriers are all investing heavily.\" This is not surprising when analysts are predicting the revenue stream from VOIP may surpass $24bn by 2003. </p> <p>Last month Global Crossing, for example, announced that it is converting its entire fibre global network to VOIP and transferred the first part of its US network onto VOIP routers capable of handling 1,600 calls per second. London and the rest of Europe will follow by the end of this year. Cable &amp; Wireless signed a $1.4bn deal two weeks ago with Nortel to convert its circuit network over to VOIP. </p> <p>There's one compelling reason why carriers want to move to VOIP, say analysts: cost. \"IP as a technology is inherently cost efficient relative to ATM and frame relay, alternative telecommunications technologies for sending data over phone lines, and a lot easier to deploy and manage,\" says Jim Reilly, Cable &amp; Wireless's senior vice president of global networks. And as revenues fall from traditional switched voice networks, carriers must seek new markets, and those are clearly in data services, says Reilly. Cable &amp; Wireless currently gets 60% of its revenue from voice services for businesses but margins are narrowing and growth is slowing. \"The only place we see any growth is in the delivery of IP services and applications that run on those services,\" he says. </p> <p>That has spurred infrastructure providers like Cisco to regear towards VOIP as well. Maren Bennette, emerging technology sales manager for Cisco UK, says VOIP is integral to Cisco's future. \"It's the cornerstone of much of what we're doing. The networks that we've known of old aren't capable of handling the wide amount of data we're throwing at them.\" </p> <p>Businesses will be driven to VOIP because of cost savings as well, says Dataquest's Thomson. Communications needs are the third largest cost to companies, according to Henry Woods, managing director of Softech Telecom, a company which makes telecommunications software for managing and tracking calls. Most obvious is the price of making calls, which will drop drastically with VOIP. Less visible are areas the industry calls \"moves and changes\". If an employee changes desks and needs to move an existing extension, or if extensions need to be added, or extra handsets, \"quite a lot of work has to be done to make that switch,\" says Woods. </p> <p>\"Sometimes, a company has different exchanges in different buildings, all managed by different software and different switch cards. And the cards are phenomenally expensive\" - the order of \u00a32,000 to add four extra lines, he says. VOIP replaces the costly cards with much cheaper and more intelligent routers from companies like Cisco and Juniper, and allows all the extensions of a single company to be managed from one point. Move to a new desk - even for five minutes - and your extension follows you to the new phone. </p> <p> That's another key benefit of VOIP - the intelligence moves out of the cards at the middle of the network and into smart phones and other devices at the ends of the network. \"The phone becomes an IP appliance and it's relatively simple to add new applications,\" says Bennette, who addressed Softech's user conference in Dublin last week. \"You can do a lot of clever stuff you'd never even think of doing with a regular circuit-based phone.\" For example, you can create personalized menus, use web-based services, and layer on applications to make your phone a personal assistant; you can video-conference, let any phone you're sitting next to know you're there for call-forwarding, integrate voice, fax and email in one device. \"It's the user applications that give you the sizzle on top of the steak,\" he says. </p> <p>All very nice, says Thomson, but carriers and service providers still need to come up with a business model. \"They don't know how to price, bundle or bill for these services,\" she says. </p> <p>Many also feel VOIP is not yet ready for mainstream take-up by either consumers or businesses. The main reason is obvious as soon as you try your first net phonecall - the quality is unpredictable. Nonetheless, companies are beginning to convert. Some 5% of UK companies say they are testing VOIP systems and 15% have told analyst Gartner Group that they will be trialing VOIP by the end of the year. The Business Communications Review predicts 60%of companies will have VOIP in place within two to three years. Systems should be up to scratch for businesses within that time, says Woods. </p> <p>But almost nobody has considered the legal and political ramifications of the move to VOIP. Because IP telephony networks place all data on a single line, monitoring and surveillance of those lines is far easier than ever, says David Banisar, legal counsel for Washington DC privacy advocates the Electronic Privacy Information Center. For companies like Softech Telecom, that's a plus, enabling them to create software that makes the management of company systems much easier and allows firms to precisely track and analyse data traffic. </p> <p>But those capabilities also raise privacy concerns. Documents on the FBI's secret Carnivore surveillance system recently released under court order to EPIC reveal the FBI is actively looking at surveillance over VOIP. \"But using encryption is also easier,\" notes Banisar. He hopes the use of encryption will become widespread with VOIP's adoption, and cautions that provisions within the UK government's Regulation of Investigatory Powers (RIP) act would presumably allow VOIP systems to be monitored with few checks and balances. </p> <p>If that's the case, visiting aliens might want to proceed carefully if phoning home from a PC in the UK - or at least download an encryption program first. </p> <p><strong> What you need</strong><br> While there is a lot of interest in VOIP, the idea has not exactly fired the imagination of most computer users - yet. Only 4% of calls last year were made over the net, says Probe Research. </p> <p>But Forrester Research predicts that net calls will be a $1bn industry by 2002. </p> <p>Making calls is easy. Most computers shipped in the past two years need little additional gear, since nearly all have a sound card. </p> <p>So just add a headset- widely available from computer stores for under \u00a310 - and you're ready to dip into free calls or low, flat-rate global calls. </p> <p>Sites require you to register and in some cases, to download a small application. </p> <p>Try <a href=\"http://www.net2phone.com\">www.net2phone.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.go2call.co.uk\">www.go2call.co.uk</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.iconnecthere.com\">www.iconnecthere.com</a>. </p> <p>Both <a href=\"http://www.msn.co.uk\">MSN</a> and <a href=\"http://www.icq.com\">ICQ</a> offer calls along with their instant messaging software. </p> <p>If you're hooked, you might consider buying a special $160 Internet PhoneJACK card from Quicknet.com that turns your PC or laptop into a mini-switch for IP calls. </p> <p>US Robotics/3Com makes a modem with Net2phone that allows you to make IP calls through your phone seee <a href=\"http://www.usr.com\">www.usr.com</a>, or you could try an <a href=\"http://www.aplio.com\">Aplio netphone</a>. </p> <p>Bsquare makes software that turns a Windows CE handheld into an IP telephony device. </p> <p>And <a href=\"http://www.cisco.com\">Cisco</a> has a new, if pricy, webphone complete with screen. </p> <p><strong> How it works</strong><br> Nearly all voice traffic at the moment is carried over circuit-switched networks - a telephony concept that hasn't changed much since Alexander Graham Bell said: \"Mr Watson, come here.\" </p> <p>Once, an operator connected a call by plugging a set of wires into a big switchboard to link the caller to the recipient, creating a complete circuit. Today, despite the fact that most voice traffic on modern networks is digitised - converted into samples of sound which are transmitted across the phone network - each call still requires a dedicated route to be set up for it to link you and the person you're calling. </p> <p>That circuit remains open for the duration of the call and claims a small slice of bandwidth on new-era digital, fibre optic networks, even when no one is saying anything and no digital information is moving across the line. </p> <p>IP telephony, in contrast, uses the internet's method of efficiently using bandwidth. The digitised sound samples of your voice are broken into tiny packets of information that scatter and reassemble to be delivered into the recipient's headset or telephone. Six times as many calls can be squeezed into the same amount of bandwidth, making huge cost savings. </p> <p>In addition, a single router can handle many times the amount of data at a tenth of the cost of expensive telephone switch cards, without the additional wiring, software and management costs. And, VOIP networks integrate video, voice and data onto a single line. </p>",

      "body": "<p>Earlier this year <a href=\"http://www.jungle.com/\" target=\"_new\">Jungle.com</a> was swinging confidently through the virtual trees expecting an immensely successful flotation on the stock market. But the leading UK e-tailer, like many other dot.coms, was suddenly brought down to earth with a painful bump when hordes of investors began to frantically dump over-valued technology stocks. </p> <p>Seeking extra cash and a concrete strategy for the future, Jungle.com linked up in September with the UK-based catalogue retail group, Great Universal Stores. To take control of Jungle, GUS agreed to pay \u00a337m. </p> <p>This move has been seen as evidence that traditional bricks and mortar companies are now striking back. As dot.coms have tumbled in price, they are swooping down and trying to snap up some virtual bargains. Their aim is to gain quick entry into the online economy, with an established brand and the technology, without having to take on the risk of launching their own start up operations. </p> <p>\"A year ago everyone was saying the new economy is here and the old economy is dead. Now everyone is saying dot coms are dead and the dinosaurs have won. Both of these are overstatements and the truth is somewhere in between,\" says Andersen's UK head of e-strategy, Andrew Mendoza, who expects to see plenty more corporates closing in to acquire dot.coms. </p> <p>For his part, Jungle.com's chief executive and founder, Steve Bennett still feels some disappointment that his company failed to cut it as a stand-alone web e-tailer. </p> <p>'If you roll out five years from now when you will have higher internet penetration, then you will find it easier to be a stand alone online business. Today it makes much more sense to be part of a group,\" he says. </p> <p>Being a part of GUS has relieved a lot of the pressure that Bennett was under. The deal has meant that Jungle.com's marketing and customer acquisition costs have now been considerably reduced. GUS own Argos and it is able to use its purchasing power to introduce more electrical goods to Jungle's site. The company also promotes Jungle's services through its stores. </p> <p>Faced with potential rich pickings from the dot.com world, it can be difficult for bricks and mortar companies to know the exact value of what they are buying. Often the main knowledge about an e- business is stored in the heads of a few of the dot.com directors and predatory corporates have to be careful to hold onto those key staff when they start plotting their mergers and acquisitions. </p> <p>Kingfisher, which owns Comet, B&amp;Q and Woolworths, has set up a dedicated unit to invest in dot.coms. Launching the e-Kingfisher service, chief executive Geoffrey Mulcahy pointed out that sales of more than \u00a311bn in Kingfisher's market sectors in Germany, France and the UK will have moved online by 2004. He wants Kingfisher to \"grasp e-commerce and develop value and service-driven direct channels to customers which respond effectively to their changing needs\". </p> <p>Already Kingfisher has invested in the natural health and body care site, <a href=\"http://www.ThinkNatural.com\" target=\"_new\">Think Natural.com</a>, on the grounds that it complements Superdrug's high street offering. </p> <p>\"They offer us a brand which is in a space we're not in and they offer us online expertise,\" explains chief executive of e-Kingfisher Ventures, Stephen O'Brien. \"I don't think if you're a bricks and mortar retailer you're going to automatically succeed in the online world. We have to make the right alliances and move quickly into the right space.\" </p> <p>He adds that B&amp;Q has invested in <a href=\"http://Improveline.com/\" target=\"_new\">Improveline.com</a> which recommends DIY professionals to help people carry out their home improvements. But does he think bricks and mortar companies and dot.coms are entirely compatible? </p> <p>\"There are slight differences in culture,\" admits O'Brien. \"The dot.com start-ups are usually very lean and have very few people and they are used to cutting through things more quickly.\" He thinks a number of pure internet retailers will succeed on their own but, generally, he feels bricks and mortar and dot.com partnerships can strengthen both parties - especially when it comes to finance. </p> <p>\"In recent times, financial advisers have been much happier when someone like us has been alongside a dot.com,\" he says. </p> <p>The fact that corporates are making their presence felt is largely a symptom of the fact that the internet market is still immature. Steve Bennett acknowledges that bricks and mortar companies have a part to play in the market's development but in the long term he believes stand alone web e-tailers will change the face of shopping. </p> <p>\"When you buy a CD online it is a much better experience than going to HMV or Virgin,\" he argues. \"It's cheaper and you can listen to every track.\" </p> <p>The ability of the internet to cut costs also convinces him that the new medium will transform old business models. He points out that traditional catalogue companies can now send out one-to-one personalised emails taking account of a customer's previous shopping preferences which is much cheaper than shipping out hefty publications. </p> <p>Just recently <a href=\"http://www.LastMinute.com\" target=\"_new\">LastMinute.com</a> impressed web sceptics in the City when it announced the appointment of Allan Leighton as non-executive chairman. His bricks and mortar credentials are impeccable. Until recently he was chief executive of Wal-Mart Europe and before that he was group chief executive of the Asda Group. </p> <p> Martha Lane Fox, Lastminute's co-founder, argues that there is little difference between e-tailers and traditional bricks and mortar retailers. \"We just happen to deliver through the internet. There are obviously some differences but at the same time the same challenges face us all. The focus is on delivering services and value to our customers.\" </p> <p>Needless to say there is likely to be more of a dot.com shake up over the coming months. But in spite of the headline-grabbing failures, the fact remains that bricks and mortar companies and their top executives are now actively seeking out and integrating themselves with a few select dot.coms which suggests that e-business is slowly shaping up to become a real business of the future.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Earlier this year Jungle.com was swinging confidently through the virtual trees expecting an immensely successful flotation on the stock market. But the leading UK e-tailer, like many other dot.coms, was suddenly brought down to earth with a painful bump when hordes of investors began to frantically dump over-valued technology stocks. Seeking extra cash and a concrete strategy for the future, Jungle.com linked up in September with the UK-based catalogue retail group, Great Universal Stores. To take control of Jungle, GUS agreed to pay \u00a337m. This move has been seen as evidence that traditional bricks and mortar companies are now striking back. As dot.coms have tumbled in price, they are swooping down and trying to snap up some virtual bargains. Their aim is to gain quick entry into the online economy, with an established brand and the technology, without having to take on the risk of launching their own start up operations. \"A year ago everyone was saying the new economy is here and the old economy is dead. Now everyone is saying dot coms are dead and the dinosaurs have won. Both of these are overstatements and the truth is somewhere in between,\" says Andersen's UK head of e-strategy, Andrew Mendoza, who expects to see plenty more corporates closing in to acquire dot.coms. For his part, Jungle.com's chief executive and founder, Steve Bennett still feels some disappointment that his company failed to cut it as a stand-alone web e-tailer. 'If you roll out five years from now when you will have higher internet penetration, then you will find it easier to be a stand alone online business. Today it makes much more sense to be part of a group,\" he says. Being a part of GUS has relieved a lot of the pressure that Bennett was under. The deal has meant that Jungle.com's marketing and customer acquisition costs have now been considerably reduced. GUS own Argos and it is able to use its purchasing power to introduce more electrical goods to Jungle's site. The company also promotes Jungle's services through its stores. Faced with potential rich pickings from the dot.com world, it can be difficult for bricks and mortar companies to know the exact value of what they are buying. Often the main knowledge about an e- business is stored in the heads of a few of the dot.com directors and predatory corporates have to be careful to hold onto those key staff when they start plotting their mergers and acquisitions. Kingfisher, which owns Comet, B&amp;Q and Woolworths, has set up a dedicated unit to invest in dot.coms. Launching the e-Kingfisher service, chief executive Geoffrey Mulcahy pointed out that sales of more than \u00a311bn in Kingfisher's market sectors in Germany, France and the UK will have moved online by 2004. He wants Kingfisher to \"grasp e-commerce and develop value and service-driven direct channels to customers which respond effectively to their changing needs\". Already Kingfisher has invested in the natural health and body care site, Think Natural.com, on the grounds that it complements Superdrug's high street offering. \"They offer us a brand which is in a space we're not in and they offer us online expertise,\" explains chief executive of e-Kingfisher Ventures, Stephen O'Brien. \"I don't think if you're a bricks and mortar retailer you're going to automatically succeed in the online world. We have to make the right alliances and move quickly into the right space.\" He adds that B&amp;Q has invested in Improveline.com which recommends DIY professionals to help people carry out their home improvements. But does he think bricks and mortar companies and dot.coms are entirely compatible? \"There are slight differences in culture,\" admits O'Brien. \"The dot.com start-ups are usually very lean and have very few people and they are used to cutting through things more quickly.\" He thinks a number of pure internet retailers will succeed on their own but, generally, he feels bricks and mortar and dot.com partnerships can strengthen both parties - especially when it comes to finance. \"In recent times, financial advisers have been much happier when someone like us has been alongside a dot.com,\" he says. The fact that corporates are making their presence felt is largely a symptom of the fact that the internet market is still immature. Steve Bennett acknowledges that bricks and mortar companies have a part to play in the market's development but in the long term he believes stand alone web e-tailers will change the face of shopping. \"When you buy a CD online it is a much better experience than going to HMV or Virgin,\" he argues. \"It's cheaper and you can listen to every track.\" The ability of the internet to cut costs also convinces him that the new medium will transform old business models. He points out that traditional catalogue companies can now send out one-to-one personalised emails taking account of a customer's previous shopping preferences which is much cheaper than shipping out hefty publications. Just recently LastMinute.com impressed web sceptics in the City when it announced the appointment of Allan Leighton as non-executive chairman. His bricks and mortar credentials are impeccable. Until recently he was chief executive of Wal-Mart Europe and before that he was group chief executive of the Asda Group. Martha Lane Fox, Lastminute's co-founder, argues that there is little difference between e-tailers and traditional bricks and mortar retailers. \"We just happen to deliver through the internet. There are obviously some differences but at the same time the same challenges face us all. The focus is on delivering services and value to our customers.\" Needless to say there is likely to be more of a dot.com shake up over the coming months. But in spite of the headline-grabbing failures, the fact remains that bricks and mortar companies and their top executives are now actively seeking out and integrating themselves with a few select dot.coms which suggests that e-business is slowly shaping up to become a real business of the future.",

      "body": "<p><strong> Spurred on to greater efforts</strong><br> <strong> Championship Manager 3 Season 00/01 </strong><br> PC \u00a319.99 Sports Interactive/ Eidos Interactive ***** <br> It was a great season in the Premiership with Tottenham Hotspur winning the 2000-01 title on goal difference from Liverpool, ahead of Chelsea and Southampton. But not so good for Bradford City, Manchester City and Charlton, who were relegated. It was even worse for England, who were thrashed by Finland, Greece and even Albania, and look like finishing bottom of Group 9. </p> <p>The main problem is that Spurs's manager, my son James, can't take the England job. He has to go to school. </p> <p>The Collyer brothers, creators of the long-running Championship Manager series, may be upset, too. They keep making CM more realistic (ie harder) and it may now be impossible to win the Champions League with Wycombe Wanderers. Even with Spurs you can't afford the players you want, and the ones you can afford won't sign. However, it is still possible to win the title first time out with skill and a couple of judicious buys (Misto, Solano), though I have yet to prove I can do it with Arsenal. </p> <p>Suffice it to say that the new version of CM3, launched tomorrow, is an essential buy for the updated and re-rated squads and managers, and new rules. Also, managers can now respond to media stories, and the transfer system has been improved. Otherwise it plays almost exactly as before. </p> <p>The new season's version also extends its geographical reach with 10 new leagues, including Australia, Greece, Poland and Turkey. The game now includes about 50,000 players in 26 leagues, though you can also play with random, fictional squads if you fancy the challenge. Since half the fun is beating Manchester United, Barcelona or Juventus on their own turf, however, not many people will bother. </p> <p>Apple Macintosh users will not have long to wait before they can join in too. The Mac version of CM 00/01 will be published by <a href=\"http://www.feral.co.uk\">Feral</a> on November 10. (JS) </p> <p> <strong> This Blairs no resemblance to the film</strong><br> <strong> Blair Witch Vol 1: Rustin Parr</strong><br> PC CD-rom \u00a319.99 Terminal Reality/ Take 2 Interactive *** <br> The witching hour is truly upon us. Not only is The Blair Witch Project coming out on video, but Blair Witch 2 is preparing to darken our cinema screens, and as an eerie coup de grace the first of (at least) three Blair Witch games is about to hit the shelves. </p> <p>Mind you, the connection between this game and the doomed documentary-making trio is a shaky one. You see, Rustin Parr is not just the first Blair Witch game; it also marks the second adventure for Spookhouse, a team of government-sanctioned paranormal investigators who made their debut in 1999's Nocturne. </p> <p>The tie-in? The Nocturners are investigating the crime that kicked off the Burkitsville witch-hunt - the murder of six children by local hermit Rustin Parr. Spookhouse suspects something more sinister than a case of cabin fever, and dispatches boringly gorgeous agent Doc Holliday to investigate. </p> <p>What follows is only tenuously in keeping with the Blair story. Zombies? Vampires? Spectral proximity sensors? But it is every bit as scary. Atmospheric environments, superbly effective lighting and a slick graphics engine add up to a visual fright on a par with a headlong dive into Noel Gallagher's eyebrows. </p> <p>Fortunately, our foxy doc has a of knapsack full of knick-knacks to help her complete her quest: pistol, rifle, energy weapon, compass, sensors, flashlight and night goggles. </p> <p>Gameplaywise, Blair Witch is unashamed in its cannibalisation of dead third-person adventures. The programmers have clearly spent plenty of time playing Resident Evil, and there's an even stronger odour of those pioneering point-and-click horror titles, Phantasmagoria and Gabriel Knight.

But not so good for Bradford City, Manchester City and Charlton, who were relegated. It was even worse for England, who were thrashed by Finland, Greece and even Albania, and look like finishing bottom of Group 9. The main problem is that Spurs's manager, my son James, can't take the England job. He has to go to school. The Collyer brothers, creators of the long-running Championship Manager series, may be upset, too. They keep making CM more realistic (ie harder) and it may now be impossible to win the Champions League with Wycombe Wanderers. Even with Spurs you can't afford the players you want, and the ones you can afford won't sign. However, it is still possible to win the title first time out with skill and a couple of judicious buys (Misto, Solano), though I have yet to prove I can do it with Arsenal. Suffice it to say that the new version of CM3, launched tomorrow, is an essential buy for the updated and re-rated squads and managers, and new rules. Also, managers can now respond to media stories, and the transfer system has been improved. Otherwise it plays almost exactly as before. The new season's version also extends its geographical reach with 10 new leagues, including Australia, Greece, Poland and Turkey. The game now includes about 50,000 players in 26 leagues, though you can also play with random, fictional squads if you fancy the challenge. Since half the fun is beating Manchester United, Barcelona or Juventus on their own turf, however, not many people will bother. Apple Macintosh users will not have long to wait before they can join in too. The Mac version of CM 00/01 will be published by Feral on November 10. (JS) This Blairs no resemblance to the film Blair Witch Vol 1: Rustin Parr PC CD-rom \u00a319.99 Terminal Reality/ Take 2 Interactive *** The witching hour is truly upon us. Not only is The Blair Witch Project coming out on video, but Blair Witch 2 is preparing to darken our cinema screens, and as an eerie coup de grace the first of (at least) three Blair Witch games is about to hit the shelves. Mind you, the connection between this game and the doomed documentary-making trio is a shaky one. You see, Rustin Parr is not just the first Blair Witch game; it also marks the second adventure for Spookhouse, a team of government-sanctioned paranormal investigators who made their debut in 1999's Nocturne. The tie-in? The Nocturners are investigating the crime that kicked off the Burkitsville witch-hunt - the murder of six children by local hermit Rustin Parr. Spookhouse suspects something more sinister than a case of cabin fever, and dispatches boringly gorgeous agent Doc Holliday to investigate. What follows is only tenuously in keeping with the Blair story. Zombies? Vampires? Spectral proximity sensors? But it is every bit as scary. Atmospheric environments, superbly effective lighting and a slick graphics engine add up to a visual fright on a par with a headlong dive into Noel Gallagher's eyebrows. Fortunately, our foxy doc has a of knapsack full of knick-knacks to help her complete her quest: pistol, rifle, energy weapon, compass, sensors, flashlight and night goggles. Gameplaywise, Blair Witch is unashamed in its cannibalisation of dead third-person adventures. The programmers have clearly spent plenty of time playing Resident Evil, and there's an even stronger odour of those pioneering point-and-click horror titles, Phantasmagoria and Gabriel Knight. Unsurprisingly, BW:RP suffers from similar drawbacks: linearity, low replayability, self-determining cameras and cramped little spaces that mean the bad guys are on top of you the second you enter a new area. But if there are flaws in the design, there are none in the execution.

      "body": "<p><strong> Have you been using computers and the internet for long?</strong> I bought an Atari ST 520 and a sampler with the royalty cheque from my first album in about 1987. I got into the internet in the early 90s. Just the concept that there's all this knowledge available that you can access via the telephone is exciting and it really has empowered us. You can go from looking at pictures of the Mars landings to finding out what your car is all about. From downloading the latest software to listening to jazz radio stations in America. </p> <p><strong> Is the net still an exciting place to be?</strong> I think it's becoming more exciting. I travel a lot and I can't wait for the time when, instead of the boring TV in the corner of your room, you just have a computer. When I left school computer studies was a minor option but now it's almost as important as taking maths or English. </p> <p><strong> Were you disappointed with the poor showing of Wap?</strong> I didn't really bother with Wap as it's not what I was looking for at all. I carry a Macintosh G3 around and hook that up to the internet instead. </p> <p><strong> How have formats such as MP3 affected the traditional forms of music distribution?</strong> It's similar to when they brought DAT (digital audio tapes) in and everyone was panicking about that. There will always be a certain amount of panic when you introduce new technology. I don't like the sound of MP3 as it takes away the high-end frequencies such as the snare drum. It affects reverb as well. In terms of having 20 MP3 files in my laptop as opposed to carrying 20 CDs around then it is quite convenient and I am very much into it. </p> <p><strong> Do you enjoy the relationship between technology and music?</strong> Definitely. When I started making music with my Atari it was a ridiculously feeble machine! I think I composed one advert on that as opposed to now where I've just done a whole album on my computer. The technology is so advanced now that you can be up at 3am editing the syllables in words if you want. </p> <p>I have a PowerMac 9500/200 with a G3 card on which I run Pro Tools software with Logic Audio at the front end.

      "bodyText": "Have you been using computers and the internet for long? I bought an Atari ST 520 and a sampler with the royalty cheque from my first album in about 1987. I got into the internet in the early 90s. Just the concept that there's all this knowledge available that you can access via the telephone is exciting and it really has empowered us. You can go from looking at pictures of the Mars landings to finding out what your car is all about. From downloading the latest software to listening to jazz radio stations in America. Is the net still an exciting place to be? I think it's becoming more exciting. I travel a lot and I can't wait for the time when, instead of the boring TV in the corner of your room, you just have a computer. When I left school computer studies was a minor option but now it's almost as important as taking maths or English. Were you disappointed with the poor showing of Wap? I didn't really bother with Wap as it's not what I was looking for at all. I carry a Macintosh G3 around and hook that up to the internet instead. How have formats such as MP3 affected the traditional forms of music distribution? It's similar to when they brought DAT (digital audio tapes) in and everyone was panicking about that. There will always be a certain amount of panic when you introduce new technology. I don't like the sound of MP3 as it takes away the high-end frequencies such as the snare drum. It affects reverb as well. In terms of having 20 MP3 files in my laptop as opposed to carrying 20 CDs around then it is quite convenient and I am very much into it. Do you enjoy the relationship between technology and music? Definitely. When I started making music with my Atari it was a ridiculously feeble machine! I think I composed one advert on that as opposed to now where I've just done a whole album on my computer. The technology is so advanced now that you can be up at 3am editing the syllables in words if you want. I have a PowerMac 9500/200 with a G3 card on which I run Pro Tools software with Logic Audio at the front end. I've also just bought two of the Sony flat screens. Any favourite haunts on the net? Obviously there's the upcoming Saxophone Journal. I often go to Rio Port and I'm into cricket so I like to check out the Caribbean Cricket site. There's a really nice site called Darker Than Blue and I might apply for a job soon at the Nasa site. I'm also really into computer games so there's loads of sites I go to for codes and cheats. Do you like gadgets? I've just bought a Visor palmtop which will let me get emails anywhere. I guess my favourite has to be my G3 - that's also my DVD player, and I've got a PlayStation emulation system so I can play games. But I want it to actually work as a studio when I'm on the move.

At the pub, my friend Dave, who's a lovely bloke, started talking about his new girlfriend like she was a sexual conquest. </p> <p>'She's a beast in bed,' he said, whereas minutes before he'd been telling a group of girls how in love he was. When the blokes were going on about 'pussies' and 'great tits', I didn't know whether to join in. All the rules about what I can say to whom have changed . . . Also my sex drive feels different . I still get turned on by the same things, but I don't feel the emotional side of sex is as necessary as I did - even with the woman I love.

At the pub, my friend Dave, who's a lovely bloke, started talking about his new girlfriend like she was a sexual conquest. 'She's a beast in bed,' he said, whereas minutes before he'd been telling a group of girls how in love he was. When the blokes were going on about 'pussies' and 'great tits', I didn't know whether to join in. All the rules about what I can say to whom have changed . . . Also my sex drive feels different . I still get turned on by the same things, but I don't feel the emotional side of sex is as necessary as I did - even with the woman I love. I'm more genitally oriented and don't care so much about foreplay. After sex, I'm exhausted and just want to go to sleep.

      "bodyText": "British diplomats were finally allowed access to a Cuban prison last night to speak to a team of private investigators jailed on suspicion of spying. But political tensions between Britain and Cuba were still strained after the Cuban government appeared convinced that the British private detectives were involved in international espionage. Cuba granted British diplomats in Havana access to the seven detainees following tense negotiations where the country's charg\u00e9 d'affaires in London was summoned to meet foreign office minister Peter Hain. Previously the Cubans had refused all requests to grant access and were accused of breaching human rights. The Cuban authorities are still investigating allegations that the Britons had been hired for private investigation into a case of infidelity involving a Cuban national, for which they were using methods in breach of Cuban law. According to earlier reports, the detectives were hired to spy on Mike Nahmad, the head of Cuba's Genpower firm, a Panamanian company which supplies much of Fidel Castro's regime with electricity. His is the only 100% foreign-owned private company in the country. It was reported that the men were hired to trap the millionaire suspected of adultery. But Mr Nahmad's wife told Channel 4 last night she had no idea about the furore. \"I am married to Mr Nahmad and I don't know anything about what you are telling me.\" Mr Hain, calling the incident \"rather bizarre\", added \"I asked either that charges be brought against the detainees straightaway, or that they be released.\" The six men and a woman - believed to be the girlfriend of a detective - are being held by the department of state security in Havana. They were arrested on October 8. The British charge d'affaires in Cuba attempted to visit the detainees in the state security prison again yesterday. But a Foreign Office spokesman said: \"He was denied access to them by the Cuban authorities. He was assured they were in good health.\" Cuba's about-face came after the meeting with Mr Hain at 5.30pm yesterday when the Foreign Office was told the meeting could take place within two hours. Sources said last night that the team was suspected of spying on Cuba's sensitive network of outdated Soviet-built power stations which are undergoing refurbishment. It was strongly suspected that they were spying on sensitive sites to provide information for other countries, possibly with links to America which still has a hostile relationship with Cuba over trade embargos. Six of the detainees worked for SIP Investigations, based in Snarebrook, east London. They include the firm's owner, Ken Lodge, fellow Londoner, John Fawcett, Derek Pitt from Hertfordshire, two men identified only as Will Smart and Mike, and the latter's girlfriend. British authorities were told of the detentions on October 9 but did not receive written notification until October 13. They were told the Cuban authorities had undertaken to provide access to a lawyer, believed to be local. Last night a source close to the the Cuban department of state security said there had been no official statement in Havana relating to the arrests and the matter had not been reported in the Cuban media. \"Off the record, the government is very much convinced that there is something more beneath the surface than a wife suspecting her husband of cheating,\" said a source. \"The government suspects these Britons may have been used as a way of destabilising the improved relations with Britain. One angle being looked at is they were given a red herring over this matrimonial dispute and dragged into something bigger than they could handle. \"There is a sense of amazement that a team of private detectives could indulge in such a foolish exercise, especially as the man they were tailing was a powerful individual and easily able to get official protection for his privacy.\"",
