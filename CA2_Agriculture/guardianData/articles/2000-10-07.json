They have lost the effortless supremacy - based on global spread, unlimited wealth, invincible brands and touchingly loyal customers - which they once so richly enjoyed. Instead, they must battle to defend their markets and their margins against pressures, including new competition, over which they have no control.

In the same industry, Daimler-Benz bought Chrysler (and double-trouble) while changing spectacularly from luxury supplier to manufacturer of everything from whacky Smart runabouts to lush lim ousines. Its latest profits are down by 30 per cent. At Kodak, Xerox and Procter &amp; Gamble, chief executive officers have left after proving unable to crack severe marketplace problems. The same fate has just overtaken Peter Salsbury at Marks &amp; Spencer.

Kodak's loss of market share to Fuji, and its failure to develop new businesses, turned it from leader to follower; sales fell by a quarter over the Nineties.

Each costly blunder savages a firm's Economic Value Added - the vital difference between capital's cost and its return. Blow $1.4bn for a negative return, and you've created a permanent drag on the finances. When reality creeps (or crashes) in, boards commonly conclude that only a new broom will sweep clean enough. Kodak chose George Fisher for his record at Motorola (now itself troubled). His magic failed. In any event, a new CEO is not enough: replacing the top banana doesn't change a whole overripe bunch. </p> <p>Senior managers customarily complain about resistance to change among the lowest orders. In fact, resistance among middle managers is both stronger and harder to eradicate. Many are wedded to the post and fearful for their jobs (often with reason). But their conservatism is generally outdone by their seniors. Top executives not only lived under the previous dispensation: they created it. Even Tony Blair, vaguely admitting responsibility for the Dome, is a model of outspoken self-criticism compared with the self-delusion of the typical authors of corporate failure. </p> <p>The problem with denial is that it delays response - and slow reactions invariably make bad much worse. That is why the over-familiar Supertanker Myth is so dangerous. Corporate captains like to compare their vessels with bulk oil carriers that can only turn at lugubrious speeds. That misses the crucial point. The transformation that they need changes the supertanker into a fleet of smaller, fast-moving (and fast-turning) motor boats. This metaphor was actually used by Heinrich von Pierer, CEO of Siemens, to explain his plans for corporate revolution. Three years on, his flotilla is no more impressive than the supertanker it supposedly replaced, earning half of Hewlett-Packard's profits on 50 per cent more sales. As the Siemens example shows, the groaning of the greats is heard in high technology as well as low, and for the same basic reason. Speedboats and supertankers need wholly different crews. </p> <p>What can GM shareholders expect from new CEO, Richard Wagoner, who is a 23-year veteran? What can Wagoner expect when he calls on other veteran managers to 'shake off GM's complacent, cautious traditions and take more risks'? You can only sympathise with the analyst who told the Wall Street Journal that, without someone to pressurise slow-moving management, 'there's no such thing as a price earnings ratio too low for a company [GM] with these kinds of characteristics'. </p> <p>Speed is of the essence. Yet the departed CEO of P&amp;G was berated for trying to force through too much change too fast. His company's 'restructuring' programme, however, is a five-year marathon - excessively long in any era, but an eternity in the Age of the Internet. Twenty years ago, Jack Welch started turning General Electric around with remarkable speed and legendary success, only to conclude that he should have moved faster still. Unless change comes fast and runs swift and deep, mega-companies will go on limping from one stage of underperformance to the next. </p> <p>The purple passages in between serve only to delude. Restructuring, the euphemism for closures, cutbacks and lay-offs, always pays dividends in the short to medium-term. True transformation, however, will not be achieved unless everybody in all the businesses supports the strategy and its purpose, and is fully and personally involved in its execution - from bottom to top.

If you are lucky your thoughtful employer may decide to subscribe to a service being tried out in the UK by catering and support services company Sodexho which will allow you to order your lunch online and have it delivered to your desk. Forget the power lunch, or even the humble sandwich at the local caf\u00e9, it is 'desk-dining' which is now all the rage. </p> <p>A new report from Data Monitor, 'Changing Lunch Occasions', has discovered that lunchers are a dying breed throughout much of the UK and the US. 'Time pressures and work demands have resulted in fewer workers taking time out for lunch in recent years. For workers who do not have the time to take a full lunch hour, eating at the desk is becoming increasingly widespread. \"Desk-dining\" allows the busy worker the option of continuing to work while refuelling for the afternoon ahead. Similarly, workers on the move - perhaps between meetings, offices or clients - are more likely to \"grab and go\" rather than stop for lunch in a restaurant or motorway service station,' says the report. </p> <p>Indeed desk-dining is something that social work team leader Sandra Shaw can only dream of at times. 'If I'm on the road I will eat a sandwich in my car in between visiting clients. I never feel that food is worth stopping for. I will sometimes go out at lunchtime for a walk or to do some shopping. But if I am in my office, I'm working.' </p> <p>It is not for nothing that Data Monitor says that the Spanish lunch like kings and the British like paupers. Incredibly, despite the fact that British workers are entitled to an hour for lunch, the average time taken is just 36 minutes. Yet according to the recent Eurest Lunchtime Report 2000, this is longer than it has been for a decade. While the British and the Americans are eating quickly and eating convenience foods, such as sandwiches, wraps, crisps and chocolate, the Spanish are sitting down with their families for two hours in the afternoon for a three-course meal. This will typically be a salad or vegetable starter, fish or meat course with chips, finished off with fruit or yoghurt. </p> <p>There are important health implications for this difference in culture which run counter to government initiatives to to try to reduce the levels of disease over the next decade. In Scotland, for instance, where death rates from cancer, heart disease and strokes are higher than in almost every other western industrialised country, the Health Education Board for Scotland is involved in a number of initiatives, including the Health at Work award scheme, to try to reverse the trend. While a lot of emphasis is put on providing healthy food in staff canteens or from vending machines, there is little evidence that employers are being pressed to insist that workers take their full hour for lunch. </p> <p>Also, the fact that the Eurest report found that sandwiches are still the nation's favourite lunchtime food (chosen by 49 per cent) is cause for concern, according to many nutritionists. Despite the fact that slightly more people (35 per cent) choose sandwiches made with brown/granary bread, compared with 32 per cent opting for sandwiches made with plain white bread, nutritionists, such as Savita Bhandari, say we have far too much wheat in our diets, which can cause a wide variety of health problems. </p> <p>'We often have wheat for every meal,' says Bhandari. 'A wheat-based cereal for breakfast, a biscuit with our tea mid-morning, a sandwich for lunch, a slice of cake in the afternoon and pasta for supper, is not uncommon.' Bhandari believes that persisting with this kind of diet can trigger a wheat allergy which can be recognised by a variety of symptoms, from tiredness, particularly in the afternoon, stomach cramps, wind, sinus problems and an itchy throat. </p> <p>'There is nothing wrong with having a sandwich for lunch as long as you eat a variety of different foods at other meals, says Bhandari. 'Porridge for breakfast, for instance, and in the evening rice-based meals or other grains such as pearl barley or buckwheat.' </p> <p>For hypnotherapist John Bennett, the rushed lunchtime habits of the British are compounded by the fact that so many do not give themselves time to have a proper breakfast either. 'What I see as a therapist working in Canterbury is a lot of people suffering the effects of stress. It is very important to get an overall picture of their lifestyle and one question I always ask is whether they eat breakfast. A very common response is \"no\". Diet and exercise are essential for physical health and having breakfast is a good investment in your long-term wellbeing. If your body goes for too long without food on a regular basis then this will eventually set up physical and psychological problems.' </p> <p>According to Data Monitor, the Germans and the Swedes have a particularly balanced approach to working and eating. 'Regarding lunch as the most important meal of the day, the Germans and the Swedes take this opportunity to eat a full hot meal in order to prepare themselves for the rest of the day's work. The thinking is far more in line with medical advice than the behaviour of workers in the US or UK. Consequently, meals are filling and time out is taken in order to have a proper lunch break.' </p> <p>Meanwhile, innovations continue apace to make it easier to keep on working at your desk during lunch. To go alongside the online ordering, Coca-Cola and Nestl\u00e9 have just launched a new canned coffee from 40 vending machines in Berlin. While the Germans may be able to maintain a balanced view towards eating, one can't help wondering whether, when it finally arrives in the UK, it won't simply save hard-pressed office workers wasting precious moments waiting for the kettle to boil.</p>",

Bhandari believes that persisting with this kind of diet can trigger a wheat allergy which can be recognised by a variety of symptoms, from tiredness, particularly in the afternoon, stomach cramps, wind, sinus problems and an itchy throat. 'There is nothing wrong with having a sandwich for lunch as long as you eat a variety of different foods at other meals, says Bhandari. 'Porridge for breakfast, for instance, and in the evening rice-based meals or other grains such as pearl barley or buckwheat.' For hypnotherapist John Bennett, the rushed lunchtime habits of the British are compounded by the fact that so many do not give themselves time to have a proper breakfast either. 'What I see as a therapist working in Canterbury is a lot of people suffering the effects of stress. It is very important to get an overall picture of their lifestyle and one question I always ask is whether they eat breakfast. A very common response is \"no\". Diet and exercise are essential for physical health and having breakfast is a good investment in your long-term wellbeing. If your body goes for too long without food on a regular basis then this will eventually set up physical and psychological problems.' According to Data Monitor, the Germans and the Swedes have a particularly balanced approach to working and eating. 'Regarding lunch as the most important meal of the day, the Germans and the Swedes take this opportunity to eat a full hot meal in order to prepare themselves for the rest of the day's work. The thinking is far more in line with medical advice than the behaviour of workers in the US or UK. Consequently, meals are filling and time out is taken in order to have a proper lunch break.' Meanwhile, innovations continue apace to make it easier to keep on working at your desk during lunch. To go alongside the online ordering, Coca-Cola and Nestl\u00e9 have just launched a new canned coffee from 40 vending machines in Berlin. While the Germans may be able to maintain a balanced view towards eating, one can't help wondering whether, when it finally arrives in the UK, it won't simply save hard-pressed office workers wasting precious moments waiting for the kettle to boil.",

Readers add their thoughts, and the material is given a 'reality check' by former mandarin             Sir Peter Kemp. His critiques appear on our website. Today we look at the constitution",

At least, the hard nut inside that candy-coated berry (correctly known as an \"aril\") and the dark, dense foliage is deadly, the main symptom being coldly described by the Ministry of Agriculture as \"sudden death\". But the thrush had no need to worry because the seed passes straight through its digestive system, maybe to start a new yew tree elsewhere. </p> <p>What the poet Geoffrey Grigson called Kingley Bottom's \"black tufted density\" is said to be the largest and finest yew forest in Europe, but despite its importance, it is quite difficult to find. </p> <p>Kingley Vale, as English Nature prefers to call it, was one of the first National Nature Reserves to be established in Britain, in 1952, so in a couple of years it will be celebrating its 50th birthday. But the reserve is a mere stripling compared with some of those venerable trees for which it is famous. Many have already celebrated their 500th birthday, and some may be as much as 1,000 years old. </p> <p>Kingley Vale is tucked away, hardly signposted, in a chalky fold of Stoke Down and Bow Hill, near the village of West Stoke about three miles north west of Chichester. It's worth the effort to find it because the walk through these incredibly ancient trees transports you through an Arthur Rackham landscape of tortured, twisted trunks and dark, cave-like clearings, where you half expect to see fairies or gnomes at every turn. </p> <p>The yew is a magical tree suspected by some, including Grigson, to be the Scandina vian \"world tree\" or Yggdrasil, on which the warrior god Odin hanged himself. Another warrior Norse god, Ull, the deity of bows and skiing, is said to have lived in yew dales. </p> <p>But there's little evidence to support the old folk tale about English yew wood being used for the longbows that proved to be the ultimate deterrent at battles such as Cr\u00e9cy and Agincourt. That's also the usual reason given for the traditional yew tree which stands sentinel in so many English churchyards. In fact, according to the 17th-century botanist Robert Turner, the yew was often planted there because it \"attracts and imbibes putrefaction and gross oleaginous vapours\" exhaled from the graves. </p> <p>Anyway, English bowmen preferred their staves to be made from straight-grained yew wood imported by royal decree with barrels of wine from Portugal and Spain. The English yew timber was far to too knotty and brittle. </p> <p>Yew reputedly has the hardest coniferous timber in the world, as hard as iron and usually longer-lasting. The oldest wooden artefact found in Britain is a spear made of yew found in the clay cliffs of Clacton-on-Sea in Essex. This precious fragment had survived for some 13,000 years. </p> <p>Our exploration of Kingley Bottom starts from the small car park at the foot of the hill just west of the church at West Stoke. Through a gate, you follow a stony farm track due north towards the impending woodland, with the vale still tantalisingly out of sight. Passing through some mixed woodland, you emerge again into open countryside to reach a crossroads, where an ancient bridleway crosses Stoke Down. The nature reserve is straight ahead. </p> <p>Heading north on the way-marked nature trail, the best of the oldest yews are on the right-hand side, about 20 really old twisted veterans. Some of these rich, red writhing trunks seem to take on animal forms, while others just astound with their majestic presence and sheer bulk. It's a little like walking through the hushed nave of a natural cathedral. </p> <p>Nothing much grows beneath the dense shade of these monarchs of the forest, so the walking is easy and the kids will love the hide-and-seek opportunities offered by the entwining boughs.The local legend is that the original grove of yews was planted to commemorate a battle fought in Kingley Vale by the men of Chichester against marauding Vikings in AD 859. The burial mounds at the top of the vale were supposedly where the slain Viking kings were buried, but they are now known to date from the Bronze Age. </p> <p>As you leave the ancient grove, once thought to be the meeting place of witches and druids, the vast expanse of Kingley Vale opens up. To the right is the \"young yew forest\", whose spreading branches are thought to be a mere 100 years old. The trees to the left are generally about 140 years old. </p> <p>A young yew tree needs quite a bit of help to get started, in particular \"nurse\" trees such as the low-lying juniper shrub, which English Nature is now trying to encourage in the vale. It protects the young trees from grazing, conserves water in drought, and offers shade to the infant yews. </p> <p>A steepish climb now begins up the chalky escarpment where 50 species of wild flowers, including bee orchids, have been recorded per square metre on these sweet-smelling slopes. </p> <p>The sad skeletons of dead yews over to the right on the steep, fenced-off section of the down, were killed when, incredibly, Canadian troops were allowed to use them for target practice during the second world war. </p> <p>As you approach the top of the coombe, the views to the south extend to the elegant spire of Chichester Cathedral and the snaking inlets of Chichester Harbour, with the silvery glint of the English Channel and the coast of the Isle of Wight beyond. </p> <p>On the brow of the hill is the simple sarsen stone taken from Fyfield Down in Wiltshire which marks the memorial of Sir Arthur Tansley, first chairman of the Nature Conservancy. This was his favourite viewpoint in the whole of Britain. </p> <p>The way now swings past two of the burial mounds, also known as the Devil's Humps then left and downhill, through more infant yews and the so-called \"birdless grove\" to return to the field museum and the short walk back to West Stoke. </p> <p><strong> The practicals</strong><br> </p> <p> Kingley Vale is just west of West Stoke, on the minor road between Funtington and Mid Lavant, about three miles north west of Chichester.

      "body": "<p>I set out on a series of journeys last year to travel right around the coastlines of Britain and Ireland in search of the best seafood, best fish restaurants, fish-and-chip shops, fishmongers, oyster farms, smokers and seafood suppliers on the coast, or at least near enough to the coast to hear the sound of the seagulls. </p> <p>A book about fishing called The Last of the Hunter Gatherers by Michael Wiggan had partly inspired me to go. The first lines of the book particularly got me thinking. </p> <p>\"There is something about its sea fishermen which defines a nation. Those who ply the waves for a living in all weathers, for whom the horizon is a straight silvery line tipping off the curvature of the earth, whose business is beneath in a dark, pressurised habitat where man has no place, bring back with them on to land a whiff of something far away and intangible.\" </p> <p>It bought home to me why the coasts of Britain and Ireland are so special. It is the presence of all those fishing communities and the evidence of fishing, whether it be the sight of brightly painted trawlers from all over Europe tied up in some haven, such as Lochinver in north -west Scotland, safe from the foul weather, or a beam trawler passing inside the little island just off the harbour walls of Mousehole and heading off in a light swell and a scented sharp April breeze past Lamorna Cove towards Lands End and the wide Atlantic. </p> <p>These images make the magic, which so many of us seek by the sea on our holidays. Seafood restaurants on the coast have always seemed to me to be essential to that allure. </p> <p> The south west has perhaps a greater variety of species of fish than anywhere else due to its position jutting out into the Atlantic towards the Bay of Biscay, enjoying the benefits of the warm Gulf Stream and plankton-rich water. There's an almost Mediterranean ring to many of the varieties of fish landed - red mullet, john dory, red bream, black bream, trigger fish, grey mullet and even rarities such as scorpion fish, which is used in the Mediterranean for fish soup and bouillabaisse. </p> <p>Like everywhere else, the best fish comes from small day boats which go out fishing for one day, return in the evening and sell their catch on the market the next morning. Thesouth west is blessed with a number of small fish markets such as Looe, Brixham, Newlyn and Plymouth. Fish especially worth seeking out are turbot, sea bass and Dover sole. The lemon sole of the south coast in early spring is, I think, one of the best fish in the world. </p> <p>Like everywhere in Britain and Ireland, too, the restaurants that specialise in good local seafood and do it well are few but there number is increasing. The most promising sign of this sea change is the appearance of beach caf\u00e9's such as Porthminster in St Ives, which herald a much more relaxed and informal way of enjoying some good fish by the sea. </p> <p><strong> Restaurants</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Green Street Seafood Caf\u00e9,</strong> 6 Green St, Bath, tel: 01225 448707. </p> <p><strong> Quartier Vert,</strong> 85 Whiteladies Road, Bristol, tel: 0117 9734482. </p> <p><strong> River Station,</strong> The Grove, Bristol, tel: 0117 9144434. </p> <p><strong> The Seafood Restaurant,</strong> Riverside, Padstow, tel: 01841 532700. </p> <p><strong> St Petroc's Bistro,</strong> 4 New Street, Padstow, tel: 01841 532700. </p> <p><strong> Rick Stein's Caf\u00e9,</strong> Middle Street, Padstow, tel: 01841 532700. </p> <p><strong> Alfresco,</strong> Harbourside, Wharf Road, St Ives, tel: 01736 793737. </p> <p><strong> Porthminster Caf\u00e9,</strong> Porthminster Beach, St Ives, tel: 01736 795352. </p> <p><strong> Tresanton Hotel,</strong> 27 Lower Castle Road, St Mawes, tel: 01326 270055. </p> <p><strong> Pubs with food</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> The Drewe Arms,</strong> Broadhembury, Devon, tel: 01404 841267. </p> <p><strong> Fish and chips</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Beck's,</strong> Longstone Hill, Carbis Bay, St Ives, tel: 01736 796241. </p> <p> I had a charmingly unpretentious dinner at The Bistro on the Beach at Southbourne in Bournemouth one evening last winter, hoping for some big waves at high tide to crash against the toughened-glass windows - it's that close. Much further east in Whitstable, the Whitstable Oyster Company sells oysters, lobster, crab and other shellfish and simple grilled sole, plus a great dish of roasted sea bass with garlic in an old oyster packing house right on the shingle beach. </p> <p>The South Coast is not teeming with fish any more; there are no fleets of trawlers left. Small local boats land their fish daily and often sell it at the back of the beach, a scenario repeated all the way from West Bay to Whitstable. You can go down on the beach in Brighton, Hastings or Hythe and buy lemon and Dover sole, codling, whiting, monk, flounders, dabs and plaice still jumping. </p> <p>I'd always considered plaice to be an also-ran fish, great when very fresh but not really worth considering otherwise. That was until the time I went to Portland Bill and met Paul Saunders of Saunders and Wilson. He gave me a couple of plaice to take home of such quality and flavour that I would have sworn I was eating brill. It was firm, sweet and not a bit muddy tasting. </p> <p><strong> Restaurants</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> The Hive,</strong> Beach Road, Burton Bradstock, Dorset, tel: 01308 897070. </p> <p><strong> Bistro on the Beach,</strong> Solent Promenade, Southbourne Coast Road, Bournemouth, tel: 01202 431473. </p> <p><strong> Marsh Barn Restaurant,</strong> Burton Road, Bridport, tel: 01308 422755. </p> <p><strong> The Riverside Restaurant</strong> West Bay, Dorset, tel: 01308 422011. </p> <p><strong> The Priory Oyster,</strong> (summer only) Priory Bay Hotel, Seaview, IOW, tel: 01983 613146. </p> <p><strong> The Restaurant La Terrasse,</strong> Sandgate Hotel, The Esplanade, Sandgate, Folkestone, tel: 01303 220444. </p> <p><strong> The Whitstable Oyster Fishery Co,</strong> Royal Native Oyster Stores, The Horsebridge, Whistable, Kent, tel: 01227 276856. </p> <p><strong> The Regency Restaurant,</strong> 131 King's Road, Brighton, tel:01273 325014. </p> <p><strong> Pubs</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> The Crab and Lobster Inn,</strong> Bembridge, IOW, tel: 01983 872244. </p> <p><strong> Fish and chips</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Chez Fred,</strong> Seamoor Rd, Westbourne, Bournemouth, tel: 01202 761023. </p> <p><strong> Fish n Fritz,</strong> 9 Market St, Weymouth, tel: 01305 766386. </p> <p><strong> The Spinnaker,</strong> 130 High St, Lymington, Hants, tel: 01590 677850. </p> <p><strong> Still &amp; West,</strong> Bath Square, Portsmouth, tel: 02392821567. </p> <p><strong> June's Fish Bar,</strong> 87 High St, Shanklin Old Village, IOW, tel: 01983 868570. </p> <p> I found a great fishmonger in Southend, certainly not a place where I would have expected to find one, who specialises in skate knobs, a little nugget of meat from the head which makes for extremely agreeable eating. </p> <p>I couldn't find that many good places to eat in Essex though the Company Shed in West Mersea restored my faith. Modelled on one of those seafood shacks you find all over Maine, it has a similarly ad hoc appeal with oilcloth tables, concrete floors, freshly-boiled lobsters and oysters from just down the road shucked and washed down with a bottle of Chablis that you buy from the off licence just across the road. </p> <p>Up in Suffolk and Norfolk though, there was much to enthuse about: the Lighthouse at Aldeburgh, the Crown at Snape (seagulls blown a bit inland here) and the Hoste Arms and Burnham Market in Norfolk, where I had some nice grilled cod on the night before a shrimp trawling trip out of Kings Lynn, a memory of a vast seawater boiler on the back of the trawler with steam billowing into a pink sunrise over the Wash, the colour in the sky matching the delicate hue of the good catch of pink shrimps. </p> <p>Further north was not so well endowed with good restaurants. It's got some of the best fish-and-chip shops, particularly in Whitby and Scarborough, but there seems to be a lack of initiative in celebrating the still rich produce from the North Sea with a restaurant serving bowls of mussels and fish soup, shrimps with mayonnaise, grilled flat fish and roasted halibut or cod. </p> <p>A honourable exception to this would be Brasserie 21 in Sunderland; down on the docks, a bowl of fish soup with a hot and aromatic rouille was almost better than I make myself. </p> <p><strong> Restaurants</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> The Ha'penny Bistro,</strong> The Quay, Harwich, tel: 01255 241212. </p> <p><strong> The Company Shed,</strong> 129 Coast Road, West Mersea, tel: 01206 382700. </p> <p><strong> The Hoste Arms,</strong> The Green, Burnham Market, Norfolk, tel: 01328 738777. </p> <p><strong> The Endeavour Restaurant,</strong> 1 High Street, Staithes, North Yorks, tel: 01947 840825. </p> <p><strong> The Lighthouse,</strong> 77 High Street, Aldeburgh, Suffolk, tel: 01728 453377. </p> <p><strong> The Crown,</strong> 90 High Street, Southwold, Suffolk, tel: 01502 722275. </p> <p><strong> 21 Queen Street,</strong> 19-21 Queen Street, Princes Wharf, Quayside, Newcastle, tel: 0191 222 0755. </p> <p><strong> Pubs</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> The Jolly Fisherman,</strong> Haven Hill, Craster, Northumberland, tel: 01665 576461. </p> <p><strong> The Swan,</strong> Swan Lane, Nr Beccles, Barnby, Suffolk, tel: 01502 476646. </p> <p><strong> The Ship Inn,</strong> St James Street, Dunwich, Suffolk, tel: 01728 648219. </p> <p><strong> The Crown Inn,</strong> Bridge Road, Snape, Nr Aldeburgh, Suffolk, tel: 01728 688324. </p> <p><strong> Fish and chips</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Paul's Plaice,</strong> Bentall's Shopping Centre, Heybridge, Maldon, Essex, tel: 01621 854223. </p> <p><strong> Wackers,</strong> 1 Vernon Road, Scarborough, tel: 01723 353758. </p> <p><strong> The Magpie Caf\u00e9,</strong> 14 Pier Road, Whitby, tel: 01947 602058. </p> <p><strong> Aldeburgh Fish &amp; Chip Shop,</strong> 226 High Street, Aldeburgh </p> <p><strong> Flora Tea Rooms,</strong> Dunwich Beach, Dunwich, Suffolk, tel: 01728 648433. </p> <p> I expected the east coast would be rather dull compared with the west side, which I knew, but it was delightful, mainly because of the nostalgic evidence of so much fishing activity, most of which has ceased. Communities such as Auchmithie, Sandend, and even Wick once thrived on herring fishing. But it led me to ruminate on the likely fate for most of our coasts - with the decline of fishing many of the coastal communities are destined to become charming but lifeless exhibits of past endeavour. </p> <p>I found great fish there, though - the still-bountiful produce of the North Sea and North Atlantic. The fish auctions at Peterhead, Fraserburgh, Scrabster and Kinlochbervie are bustling and successful, with good landings of fish from the north all the way to Norway. </p> <p>At the market in Peterhead, there were a dozen halibut all over 20kg. I was surrounded by boxes of the freshest brown cod I'd ever seen, speckled with yellow and tinged with green, lustrous black; monkfish with heads on for the continental market, lots of coley, or saithe as it is also known, with charcoal backs and unusual species such as wolffish, known locally as rock turbot. I found some pretty memorable meals up there, too - a crab salad at the Cellar at Anstruther on the Fife coast was all that I could have wished for. The Tollbooth at Stonehaven just outside Aberdeen had a wonderful bouillabaisse-style fish stew with really positive flavours. </p> <p><strong> Restaurants</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> The Tolbooth,</strong> The Old Pier, Stonehaven, Aberdeenshire, tel: 01569 762287. </p> <p><strong> The Shore,</strong> 3-4 The Shore, Leith, Edinburgh, tel: 0131 553 5080. </p> <p><strong> The Cellar,</strong> 24 East Green, Anstruther, Fife, tel: 01333 310378. </p> <p><strong> The Creel Restaurant with Rooms,</strong> Front Road, St Margaret's Hope, Orkney, tel: 01856 831311. </p> <p><strong> Fish and chips</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> The Bervie Chipper,</strong> Cowgate, King Street, Inverbervie, Aberdeenshire, tel: 01561 361310. </p> <p><strong> Zanres,</strong> 35 Queen Street, Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, tel: 01779 477128. </p> <p><strong> Peppo's,</strong> 51 Ladybridge Street, Arbroath, Angus, tel: 01241 872373. </p> <p><strong> The Anstruther Fish Bar,</strong> The Shore, Anstruther, Fife, tel: 01333 310518. </p> <p> Early summer this year saw me at the estuary of the river at Glencaple near Dumfries, on the River Nith, taking part in a day of half-net fishing for salmon: you wade up to your chest with a football goal-shaped net held against the flow tidewater to catch fish swimming up river. </p> <p>Later, we journeyed all the way up the west coast to Cape Wrath, stopping off at Loch Fyne Oysters for smoked salmon, a perfectly-grilled piece of halibut, and, of course, the lovely oysters. Then it was on to the Airds Hotel at Port Appin for a dish of red mullet and langoustine tails with diced red peppers, olive oil and capers. This was followed by a a week of uncharacteristically balmy weather in the far north where I came to the conclusion that the Western Isles presents one of the world's most beautiful vistas. </p> <p>I went across to Skye, to the Three Chimneys and marvelled at the remoteness of such a place and yet the sophistication of the cooking. The owners, Shirley and Eddie Spear, had left the south east of England for a better life on the Celtic fringe of the country. </p> <p>I found other restaurants on that coast such as The Summer Islands Hotel at Achiltibuie and the Albannach Hotel at Lochinver with similar idealistic southerners running great fish restaurants. Maybe that escape to a simpler life underpinned my decision to open a restaurant in Cornwall. How wrong I was! </p> <p><strong> Restaurants</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Loch Fyne Oyster Bar and Smokehouse,</strong> Clachan Farm, Cairndow, Argyll and Bute, tel: 01499 600236. </p> <p><strong> Airds Hotel,</strong> Port Appin, Argyll and Bute, tel: 01631 730236. </p> <p><strong> MacCallum's Oyster Bar,</strong> The Harbour, Troon, South Ayrshire, tel: 01292 319339. </p> <p><strong> Nairns,</strong> 13 Woodside Crescent, Glasgow, tel: 0141 3530707. </p> <p><strong> The Three Chimneys,</strong> Colbost, Dunvegan, Isle of Skye, tel: 01470 511258. </p> <p><strong> The Albannach,</strong> Baddidarrach, Lochinver, Highlands, tel: 01571 844407. </p> <p><strong> Pubs</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Morefield Motel,</strong> North Road, Ullapool, Highlands, tel: 01854 612161. </p> <p><strong> Fish and chips</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> The Unique Restaurant,</strong> 223 Allison Street, Glasgow, tel: 0141 4233366. </p> <p><strong> Seafresh Foods,</strong> West Shore Street, Ullapool, Highlands, tel: 01854 612141. </p> <p> Go out to West Cork where there's a cluster of Breton restaurants opened by people who saw in that charmed part of the country a pureness and innocence gone from Brittany. Chez Youen in Baltimore is the best of those - great fish and scallops from Bantry Bay and a caf\u00e9 too with some good chowders and seafood pizzas. I spent some time searching the west coast of Ireland for good chowders - an interesting culinary migration from France to New England and back to Ireland. I was impressed with the bowl served at Monks pub in Ballyvaughan in County Clare. </p> <p>Idealism and a wish for a simpler life flourishes in the far west in Connemara, too, where Peter Mantle left a job as a financial journalist in London to set up Delphi Lodge near Leenane. The sea trout fishing here is becoming good again after many lean years caused, Peter thinks, by the fish farms near the lodge whose presence led to an explosion of sea lice which decimated the wild popula tion.

      "bodyText": "I set out on a series of journeys last year to travel right around the coastlines of Britain and Ireland in search of the best seafood, best fish restaurants, fish-and-chip shops, fishmongers, oyster farms, smokers and seafood suppliers on the coast, or at least near enough to the coast to hear the sound of the seagulls. A book about fishing called The Last of the Hunter Gatherers by Michael Wiggan had partly inspired me to go. The first lines of the book particularly got me thinking. \"There is something about its sea fishermen which defines a nation. Those who ply the waves for a living in all weathers, for whom the horizon is a straight silvery line tipping off the curvature of the earth, whose business is beneath in a dark, pressurised habitat where man has no place, bring back with them on to land a whiff of something far away and intangible.\" It bought home to me why the coasts of Britain and Ireland are so special. It is the presence of all those fishing communities and the evidence of fishing, whether it be the sight of brightly painted trawlers from all over Europe tied up in some haven, such as Lochinver in north -west Scotland, safe from the foul weather, or a beam trawler passing inside the little island just off the harbour walls of Mousehole and heading off in a light swell and a scented sharp April breeze past Lamorna Cove towards Lands End and the wide Atlantic. These images make the magic, which so many of us seek by the sea on our holidays. Seafood restaurants on the coast have always seemed to me to be essential to that allure. The south west has perhaps a greater variety of species of fish than anywhere else due to its position jutting out into the Atlantic towards the Bay of Biscay, enjoying the benefits of the warm Gulf Stream and plankton-rich water. There's an almost Mediterranean ring to many of the varieties of fish landed - red mullet, john dory, red bream, black bream, trigger fish, grey mullet and even rarities such as scorpion fish, which is used in the Mediterranean for fish soup and bouillabaisse. Like everywhere else, the best fish comes from small day boats which go out fishing for one day, return in the evening and sell their catch on the market the next morning. Thesouth west is blessed with a number of small fish markets such as Looe, Brixham, Newlyn and Plymouth. Fish especially worth seeking out are turbot, sea bass and Dover sole. The lemon sole of the south coast in early spring is, I think, one of the best fish in the world. Like everywhere in Britain and Ireland, too, the restaurants that specialise in good local seafood and do it well are few but there number is increasing. The most promising sign of this sea change is the appearance of beach caf\u00e9's such as Porthminster in St Ives, which herald a much more relaxed and informal way of enjoying some good fish by the sea.

I had a charmingly unpretentious dinner at The Bistro on the Beach at Southbourne in Bournemouth one evening last winter, hoping for some big waves at high tide to crash against the toughened-glass windows - it's that close. Much further east in Whitstable, the Whitstable Oyster Company sells oysters, lobster, crab and other shellfish and simple grilled sole, plus a great dish of roasted sea bass with garlic in an old oyster packing house right on the shingle beach. The South Coast is not teeming with fish any more; there are no fleets of trawlers left. Small local boats land their fish daily and often sell it at the back of the beach, a scenario repeated all the way from West Bay to Whitstable. You can go down on the beach in Brighton, Hastings or Hythe and buy lemon and Dover sole, codling, whiting, monk, flounders, dabs and plaice still jumping. I'd always considered plaice to be an also-ran fish, great when very fresh but not really worth considering otherwise. That was until the time I went to Portland Bill and met Paul Saunders of Saunders and Wilson. He gave me a couple of plaice to take home of such quality and flavour that I would have sworn I was eating brill. It was firm, sweet and not a bit muddy tasting.

I found a great fishmonger in Southend, certainly not a place where I would have expected to find one, who specialises in skate knobs, a little nugget of meat from the head which makes for extremely agreeable eating. I couldn't find that many good places to eat in Essex though the Company Shed in West Mersea restored my faith. Modelled on one of those seafood shacks you find all over Maine, it has a similarly ad hoc appeal with oilcloth tables, concrete floors, freshly-boiled lobsters and oysters from just down the road shucked and washed down with a bottle of Chablis that you buy from the off licence just across the road. Up in Suffolk and Norfolk though, there was much to enthuse about: the Lighthouse at Aldeburgh, the Crown at Snape (seagulls blown a bit inland here) and the Hoste Arms and Burnham Market in Norfolk, where I had some nice grilled cod on the night before a shrimp trawling trip out of Kings Lynn, a memory of a vast seawater boiler on the back of the trawler with steam billowing into a pink sunrise over the Wash, the colour in the sky matching the delicate hue of the good catch of pink shrimps. Further north was not so well endowed with good restaurants. It's got some of the best fish-and-chip shops, particularly in Whitby and Scarborough, but there seems to be a lack of initiative in celebrating the still rich produce from the North Sea with a restaurant serving bowls of mussels and fish soup, shrimps with mayonnaise, grilled flat fish and roasted halibut or cod. A honourable exception to this would be Brasserie 21 in Sunderland; down on the docks, a bowl of fish soup with a hot and aromatic rouille was almost better than I make myself.

I expected the east coast would be rather dull compared with the west side, which I knew, but it was delightful, mainly because of the nostalgic evidence of so much fishing activity, most of which has ceased. Communities such as Auchmithie, Sandend, and even Wick once thrived on herring fishing. But it led me to ruminate on the likely fate for most of our coasts - with the decline of fishing many of the coastal communities are destined to become charming but lifeless exhibits of past endeavour. I found great fish there, though - the still-bountiful produce of the North Sea and North Atlantic. The fish auctions at Peterhead, Fraserburgh, Scrabster and Kinlochbervie are bustling and successful, with good landings of fish from the north all the way to Norway. At the market in Peterhead, there were a dozen halibut all over 20kg. I was surrounded by boxes of the freshest brown cod I'd ever seen, speckled with yellow and tinged with green, lustrous black; monkfish with heads on for the continental market, lots of coley, or saithe as it is also known, with charcoal backs and unusual species such as wolffish, known locally as rock turbot. I found some pretty memorable meals up there, too - a crab salad at the Cellar at Anstruther on the Fife coast was all that I could have wished for. The Tollbooth at Stonehaven just outside Aberdeen had a wonderful bouillabaisse-style fish stew with really positive flavours.

Early summer this year saw me at the estuary of the river at Glencaple near Dumfries, on the River Nith, taking part in a day of half-net fishing for salmon: you wade up to your chest with a football goal-shaped net held against the flow tidewater to catch fish swimming up river. Later, we journeyed all the way up the west coast to Cape Wrath, stopping off at Loch Fyne Oysters for smoked salmon, a perfectly-grilled piece of halibut, and, of course, the lovely oysters. Then it was on to the Airds Hotel at Port Appin for a dish of red mullet and langoustine tails with diced red peppers, olive oil and capers. This was followed by a a week of uncharacteristically balmy weather in the far north where I came to the conclusion that the Western Isles presents one of the world's most beautiful vistas. I went across to Skye, to the Three Chimneys and marvelled at the remoteness of such a place and yet the sophistication of the cooking. The owners, Shirley and Eddie Spear, had left the south east of England for a better life on the Celtic fringe of the country. I found other restaurants on that coast such as The Summer Islands Hotel at Achiltibuie and the Albannach Hotel at Lochinver with similar idealistic southerners running great fish restaurants. Maybe that escape to a simpler life underpinned my decision to open a restaurant in Cornwall. How wrong I was!

Go out to West Cork where there's a cluster of Breton restaurants opened by people who saw in that charmed part of the country a pureness and innocence gone from Brittany. Chez Youen in Baltimore is the best of those - great fish and scallops from Bantry Bay and a caf\u00e9 too with some good chowders and seafood pizzas. I spent some time searching the west coast of Ireland for good chowders - an interesting culinary migration from France to New England and back to Ireland. I was impressed with the bowl served at Monks pub in Ballyvaughan in County Clare. Idealism and a wish for a simpler life flourishes in the far west in Connemara, too, where Peter Mantle left a job as a financial journalist in London to set up Delphi Lodge near Leenane. The sea trout fishing here is becoming good again after many lean years caused, Peter thinks, by the fish farms near the lodge whose presence led to an explosion of sea lice which decimated the wild popula tion. The seafood in the evening at the lodge after a day's fishing is pretty special - eaten at an enormous table with Peter and fly fishermen from all over the world and involving a drowsy evening of port and tall fishing stories by a log fire even in summer.

Finally, I made four journeys to Wales and the North West of England. The highlights of those trips were on two flat and windswept stretches of sand and seaweed, one on the Gower peninsular and the other about seven miles out on Morecambe sands. In Wales I watched the gathering of cockles and enjoyed the lean fitness of the 60-year-old couple, Maureen and Elwyn Murley, who spend hours every day raking for the shells.

      "body": "<p>In the great divide of the Patagonian Alps, there is an area of biscuit-tin beauty - deep, dark lakes carved out by pleistocene glaciers in a dizzying mountain setting. </p> <p>It is so disconcertingly alpine that it called to Austrians, Swiss and Germans who came and built San Carlos de Bariloche in their own image, full of fondue, smoked wild boar and wall-to-wall chocolate shops. There are photo-opportunities with torpid St Bernards with brandy casks, and buskers in lederhosen. It has Swiss chalets, Zuric gnomes and an overweening love of lacquered logs. There are telephone boxes, bus stops, rubbish bins and whole churches of lacquered logs. Bungalows, signposts, tea houses; even the police station is shiny and varnished. </p> <p>Bariloche is a good town for food. Many restaurants offer cheap $6-$15 set meals, and you won't have to pay more than $10 for a good bottle of wine. I had a massive $6 five-star fillet steak served by a waiter with bandana and ballooning bombachas , gaucho pants, at La Vizcacha (Rolando 279). La Familia Weiss (Palacios 167) is one of the best middle-European restaurants with smoked game and fish, trout, wild boar and venison. A meal for two with wine costs $50-$60. </p> <p>But, despite the fine food, Bariloche is a young, unlovely town thrown up for tourists. Outside is a different world. </p> <p>Tucked away down the lakeside road are some tasteful traditional hotels. Ours was Hotel Tunquelen, 25km away at Llao Llao, down by the lake in ancient towering woods of southern beech, lenga and coihue, and massive sequoia-like alerces. Beyond are peaks such as the Cathedral and the Thunderer, a mountainous adventure wonderland with glorious walking, climbing, trekking, skiing and horse riding. Down the road towers the sheer rock face of Mount Lopez. A fine three-hour walk to the top gives views up the lakes towards Chile. </p> <p>I came to meet Carol Jones, the grand-daughter of a half-Welsh half-Cherokee adventurer Jarred Jones who had come down from Texas in 1887 to make his fortune. He found no gold but worked hard and bought two estancias - ranches - one on the lake and one in the mountains. Carol has inherited his Cherokee cheekbones and his horsemanship. She is muy gaucha, a real horsewoman as they say here, little wonder then that she is responsible for opening the first riding stables round these parts. </p> <p>Carol was waiting in her weather-beaten old cowboy hat and her battered Land Rover, and we drove for two hours with a trailer full of saddles, tack and supplies to Jarred's mountain estancia. The journey took us from the Latin equivalent of the lakeside Swiss Alps to the backcountry of Wyoming. The frontier was a row of pink pinnacles grasping at the sky, home to vultures and condors. Jarred's estancia, Las Mellizas, The Twins, is right up on the Great Divide. Two rivers that start up here go in opposite directions, one through Chile to the Pacific ocean and the other to the Atlantic. </p> <p>Set in a valley below a craggy mountain, the estancia consists of a few wooden shacks, with an occasional animal skin stretched over the tin roof, an old log corral, some hitching posts and saddle rails and two little adobe casitas. Half a side of beef was hanging in a big wood and wire-mesh box. </p> <p>A gaucho and his young family lived in one casita, looking after 450 head of cattle and 25 horses. It was autumn and talk was of the three-day drive down to the lakeside for the winter. </p> <p>We had come up with Carol and Lucio, a taciturn young gaucho who picked out and saddled the horses, made and tended the campfires, roasted the asado, all with effortless ease and without a word. Simple things done well. Meat, salt and fire. </p> <p>The riding was spectacular. We rode for two days across valleys with condors swooping over our heads, and along high mountain ridges way above the condors' nests looking down over the Patagonian wastelands. </p> <p>The horses were criollo, the sturdy thick-necked Argentine breed, good natured and surefooted on these narrow trails. We sat on mountain saddles like the Chileans, a high-cantled wood, leather and metal frame, covered with leather and sheepskin, very comfortable, raised from the horse's back and good for the steep climbs and descents. </p> <p>Camping out in the mountains, we fell asleep to the sound of the tucu tucus, small burrowing animals hammering away in the ground underneath us. Sitting by the campfire in the valley when the southern full moon slipped over the ridge, Mrs Wangford saw it upside down for the first time. </p> <p>The landscape was spellbinding. No wonder Jarred came here. No wonder Butch Cassidy settled down the road in Cholila.

It is so disconcertingly alpine that it called to Austrians, Swiss and Germans who came and built San Carlos de Bariloche in their own image, full of fondue, smoked wild boar and wall-to-wall chocolate shops. There are photo-opportunities with torpid St Bernards with brandy casks, and buskers in lederhosen. It has Swiss chalets, Zuric gnomes and an overweening love of lacquered logs. There are telephone boxes, bus stops, rubbish bins and whole churches of lacquered logs. Bungalows, signposts, tea houses; even the police station is shiny and varnished. Bariloche is a good town for food. Many restaurants offer cheap $6-$15 set meals, and you won't have to pay more than $10 for a good bottle of wine.

      "body": "<p>It happened gradually. To begin with, 25 years ago, I was in a caf\u00e9 by Vienna's Ringstrasse, and I asked the waitress whether the fish of the day was a seafish or a river fish. \"Alas,\" she said, \"Here in Austria we have no seafish!\" That melancholy reply still haunts me. A huge empire - once it stretched from Trieste on the Adriatic, to Mostar deep in the Southern Balkans to Constantia on the Black Sea to Brody on the borders with Tsarist Russia - had been reduced to a little land-locked rump. So a compulsion was born - to cross the empire that used to be, from its gleaming centre to its dusty borderlands. </p> <p>I read novels, essays, history books - anything to conjure up those vanished kingdoms. Most of all, I read the sad ironic fiction of Joseph Roth. He described the muddy scrubby lands on the fringes of the Empire of Franz Joseph, where civilised society dissolved and young officers drank and gambled and whored away their days. </p> <p>That decided me. One day I would take trains through Transylvania and drink coffee in grubby caf\u00e9s across the road from stuffy yellow railway stations and crumbling opera houses. </p> <p>It was another 20 years before I set off on my journey, and during the intermission the Iron Curtain had crumbled and the nations and federations which replaced the Habsburg Empire had themselves disintegrated. My travels took me from Vienna, through the Slovenian Alps to Trieste and then down through former Yugoslavia to Zagreb, Sarajevo and Mostar. That was the Western Empire, much of it acquired as late as the early 1900s. </p> <p>Then I headed back to Hungary and crossed the Puszta - the great plain - to Romanian Transylvania and Bukovina, deep in the southern Carpathian mountains. My goal was Joseph Roth's birthplace of Brody, now in western Ukraine. </p> <p>As Kaiser Franz Joseph built most of the railways, I thought it only polite to travel by train. The railway networks of central Europe have had a rough time over the past century. It is a miracle that you can plot journeys through the 11 countries that once made up a single empire and still feel confident that the trains will arrive and depart on time. When the lines were built, there was no such state as Yugoslavia, Romania stopped at the Danube and Ukraine was either Russian, Polish or Austrian. </p> <p>The first world war was midwife to all these new nations and the second put most of them behind the Iron Curtain. However, for all the recent upheavals, the Thomas Cook red railway timetable only let me down once, and the Deutsche Bahn website came up trumps every time. I booked my passage as far as Zagreb through Deutsche Bahn, but the website refused to recognise Sarajevo, which is scarcely surprising as all the lines were mined or blown up during the Yugoslav war. If you care to take it, there's a daily rust bucket from the unfashionable end of Zagreb airport. The day I was due to travel, the plane was full so I hitched a lift with the United Nations, who have had a quiet time since the end of hostilities in Kosovo. </p> <p>Deutsche Bahn also had difficulty with Chernivtsi, just over the border between Romania and Ukraine, cut off by the Carpathians, but once a handsome Habsburg regional capital with architecture to equal the grandest towns in provincial Austria. It was once an extraordinary mix of Romanians, Ukrainians, Poles, Germans and Jews, but nearly all the non-Ukrainians were wiped out in the second world war and the purges. The timetables are strictly Ukrainian and insist you take a huge detour via Lviv in the north. I arrived from Transylvania in the south east. </p> <p>As it happens, there is a train across the Carpathians, but it takes seven hours to travel 100km. The reason for this is simple. Chernivtsi was Habsburg Chernovitz until 1918 and Romanian Cernauti until 1945. Then the Soviet Union grabbed it as part of the Ukrainian Socialist Republic and replaced the standard railway tracks with Russian broad gauge ones. So there is a three-hour wait at the border to lift up the carriages and slide in a new set of wheels. </p> <p>Readers of Olivia Manning's Balkan trilogy, not to mention Agatha Christie, have romantic expectation of these trains. They certainly have splendid names, but that is the only grand thing about them. I went to Zagreb on the Geneva-Simplon-Venice-Trieste-Zagreb express. It averaged 60 miles an hour, and all I could order for lunch was warm beer and peanuts. </p> <p>By the time I reached Romania, the plastic upholstery was torn, the windows were broken, and that was after I had upgraded to first class. Chickens wandered along the tracks and dogs took the word sleeper literally and curled up between the rails. </p> <p>However, railway travel was only a by-product of my quest. Early on, I promised myself that I would drink a cup off coffee in every provincial capital of the old Empire. Coffee houses were the social embodiment of the imperial principle. The western empire certainly has some splendid watering holes. If you want to have the best of both worlds, drink a cup of Italian coffee in the Viennese Caffee San Marco in Trieste, which has not only won the gold medal of the Society of Austrian Coffee Houses, but is also home from home for Trieste's finest writer Claudio Magris. </p> <p>In Zagreb, the coffee has a more political colour. Just off the central square is Charlie's Caf\u00e9, a gathering place for the political intelligentsia for the past three decades from Tito's regime, through the war to the present day. </p> <p>To the South and east, the standard of coffee drops significantly. In Sarajevo, despite the survival of the brave little Caf\u00e9 Imperial which held out throughout the terrible shelling, you will drink better coffee in the Muslim bazaar on the east side of town. </p> <p>Cluj, the capital of Transylvania, was a Hungarian town before the first war and transferred to Romania after Austria's defeat. Ceaucescu drove out much of the Hungarian population and bussed in droves of Romanians. </p> <p>Life is far from easy for Transylvania's Hungarians, but their pride and generosity and the depth of their culture belies their struggle. They have much to be proud of, and the Habsburg grandeur of Cluj is only one example. </p> <p>In the south of the province are the splendid Siebenburgen, seven towns built by earlier German speakers in the 12th century. Most visited is Sighishoara, birthplace of Vlad Dracul, the father of Vlad the Impaler. Although its fairytale towers have nothing to do with vampires or Bram Stoker, who never visited the country, the temptation for tour companies is too great and poor Vlad Dracul's house has been turned into a restaurant serving steak and chips to busloads of Spanish tourists. </p> <p>Better go north as I did, to the remote Carpathian villages of Maramures where traditional customs, dress, architecture and music are miraculously preserved. With the courteous assistance of tour guide Dan Comanescu (Nord Nord-Vest Bvd, Republicii 15/2, Baia Mare, Maramures, Romania, tel: 0040 62 226508), we were invited to a wedding in the distant hill village of Ieaud, where the bridesmaid's hair was platted with leaves and flowers and white-smocked men and bell-skirted women danced to fiddle music that had not changed since B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k composed it a century ago. </p> <p>The same is true for much of the former Eastern Empire. Centuries of geographical isolation and 50 years of communism protected it, for good or ill, from most of the 20th century. With the help of the conscientious Iryna Zub and her travel company West-Show (Office 5, 1/3 Svobody Avenue, 79000 Lviv, Ukraine, tel: 00 380 322 723 451), you will find a culture in the cities of western Ukraine which has already been erased in Vienna and Prague and is rapidly disappearing in Budapest. </p> <p>This will certainly appeal if you are nostalgic for the grim discourtesy of the old Soviet Union. Arriving at the Hotel Kiyiv in Ukrainian Chernivtsi, I was asked to pay in advance for a room with a broken bed and without toilet paper, hot water or breakfast. I immediately upgraded to the Hotel Cheremosh, which had water between 7 pm and 11 pm, a few sheets of toilet paper and was supposedly the best hotel in town.

      "bodyText": "It happened gradually. To begin with, 25 years ago, I was in a caf\u00e9 by Vienna's Ringstrasse, and I asked the waitress whether the fish of the day was a seafish or a river fish. \"Alas,\" she said, \"Here in Austria we have no seafish!\" That melancholy reply still haunts me. A huge empire - once it stretched from Trieste on the Adriatic, to Mostar deep in the Southern Balkans to Constantia on the Black Sea to Brody on the borders with Tsarist Russia - had been reduced to a little land-locked rump. So a compulsion was born - to cross the empire that used to be, from its gleaming centre to its dusty borderlands. I read novels, essays, history books - anything to conjure up those vanished kingdoms. Most of all, I read the sad ironic fiction of Joseph Roth. He described the muddy scrubby lands on the fringes of the Empire of Franz Joseph, where civilised society dissolved and young officers drank and gambled and whored away their days. That decided me. One day I would take trains through Transylvania and drink coffee in grubby caf\u00e9s across the road from stuffy yellow railway stations and crumbling opera houses. It was another 20 years before I set off on my journey, and during the intermission the Iron Curtain had crumbled and the nations and federations which replaced the Habsburg Empire had themselves disintegrated. My travels took me from Vienna, through the Slovenian Alps to Trieste and then down through former Yugoslavia to Zagreb, Sarajevo and Mostar. That was the Western Empire, much of it acquired as late as the early 1900s. Then I headed back to Hungary and crossed the Puszta - the great plain - to Romanian Transylvania and Bukovina, deep in the southern Carpathian mountains. My goal was Joseph Roth's birthplace of Brody, now in western Ukraine. As Kaiser Franz Joseph built most of the railways, I thought it only polite to travel by train. The railway networks of central Europe have had a rough time over the past century. It is a miracle that you can plot journeys through the 11 countries that once made up a single empire and still feel confident that the trains will arrive and depart on time. When the lines were built, there was no such state as Yugoslavia, Romania stopped at the Danube and Ukraine was either Russian, Polish or Austrian. The first world war was midwife to all these new nations and the second put most of them behind the Iron Curtain. However, for all the recent upheavals, the Thomas Cook red railway timetable only let me down once, and the Deutsche Bahn website came up trumps every time. I booked my passage as far as Zagreb through Deutsche Bahn, but the website refused to recognise Sarajevo, which is scarcely surprising as all the lines were mined or blown up during the Yugoslav war. If you care to take it, there's a daily rust bucket from the unfashionable end of Zagreb airport. The day I was due to travel, the plane was full so I hitched a lift with the United Nations, who have had a quiet time since the end of hostilities in Kosovo. Deutsche Bahn also had difficulty with Chernivtsi, just over the border between Romania and Ukraine, cut off by the Carpathians, but once a handsome Habsburg regional capital with architecture to equal the grandest towns in provincial Austria. It was once an extraordinary mix of Romanians, Ukrainians, Poles, Germans and Jews, but nearly all the non-Ukrainians were wiped out in the second world war and the purges. The timetables are strictly Ukrainian and insist you take a huge detour via Lviv in the north. I arrived from Transylvania in the south east. As it happens, there is a train across the Carpathians, but it takes seven hours to travel 100km. The reason for this is simple. Chernivtsi was Habsburg Chernovitz until 1918 and Romanian Cernauti until 1945. Then the Soviet Union grabbed it as part of the Ukrainian Socialist Republic and replaced the standard railway tracks with Russian broad gauge ones. So there is a three-hour wait at the border to lift up the carriages and slide in a new set of wheels. Readers of Olivia Manning's Balkan trilogy, not to mention Agatha Christie, have romantic expectation of these trains. They certainly have splendid names, but that is the only grand thing about them. I went to Zagreb on the Geneva-Simplon-Venice-Trieste-Zagreb express. It averaged 60 miles an hour, and all I could order for lunch was warm beer and peanuts. By the time I reached Romania, the plastic upholstery was torn, the windows were broken, and that was after I had upgraded to first class. Chickens wandered along the tracks and dogs took the word sleeper literally and curled up between the rails. However, railway travel was only a by-product of my quest. Early on, I promised myself that I would drink a cup off coffee in every provincial capital of the old Empire. Coffee houses were the social embodiment of the imperial principle. The western empire certainly has some splendid watering holes. If you want to have the best of both worlds, drink a cup of Italian coffee in the Viennese Caffee San Marco in Trieste, which has not only won the gold medal of the Society of Austrian Coffee Houses, but is also home from home for Trieste's finest writer Claudio Magris. In Zagreb, the coffee has a more political colour. Just off the central square is Charlie's Caf\u00e9, a gathering place for the political intelligentsia for the past three decades from Tito's regime, through the war to the present day. To the South and east, the standard of coffee drops significantly. In Sarajevo, despite the survival of the brave little Caf\u00e9 Imperial which held out throughout the terrible shelling, you will drink better coffee in the Muslim bazaar on the east side of town. Cluj, the capital of Transylvania, was a Hungarian town before the first war and transferred to Romania after Austria's defeat. Ceaucescu drove out much of the Hungarian population and bussed in droves of Romanians. Life is far from easy for Transylvania's Hungarians, but their pride and generosity and the depth of their culture belies their struggle. They have much to be proud of, and the Habsburg grandeur of Cluj is only one example. In the south of the province are the splendid Siebenburgen, seven towns built by earlier German speakers in the 12th century. Most visited is Sighishoara, birthplace of Vlad Dracul, the father of Vlad the Impaler. Although its fairytale towers have nothing to do with vampires or Bram Stoker, who never visited the country, the temptation for tour companies is too great and poor Vlad Dracul's house has been turned into a restaurant serving steak and chips to busloads of Spanish tourists. Better go north as I did, to the remote Carpathian villages of Maramures where traditional customs, dress, architecture and music are miraculously preserved. With the courteous assistance of tour guide Dan Comanescu (Nord Nord-Vest Bvd, Republicii 15/2, Baia Mare, Maramures, Romania, tel: 0040 62 226508), we were invited to a wedding in the distant hill village of Ieaud, where the bridesmaid's hair was platted with leaves and flowers and white-smocked men and bell-skirted women danced to fiddle music that had not changed since B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k composed it a century ago. The same is true for much of the former Eastern Empire. Centuries of geographical isolation and 50 years of communism protected it, for good or ill, from most of the 20th century. With the help of the conscientious Iryna Zub and her travel company West-Show (Office 5, 1/3 Svobody Avenue, 79000 Lviv, Ukraine, tel: 00 380 322 723 451), you will find a culture in the cities of western Ukraine which has already been erased in Vienna and Prague and is rapidly disappearing in Budapest. This will certainly appeal if you are nostalgic for the grim discourtesy of the old Soviet Union.

I immediately upgraded to the Hotel Cheremosh, which had water between 7 pm and 11 pm, a few sheets of toilet paper and was supposedly the best hotel in town.

England have another World Cup qualifier in just four days' time to resurrect their qualifying hopes, with Football Association technical director Howard Wilkinson called in to take temporary charge of the team. Keegan has left their preparations in relative disarray after a 1-0 loss to the Germans in the final game at Wembley when the tactical shortcomings shown up at Euro 2000 became painfully evident. But although FA chiefs attempted to talk Keegan out of his snap decision after the final whistle, he was adamant he was \"finished\" as England coach after just 19 months in charge. Fresh from telling his players of his decision, an emotional Keegan revealed: \"I just felt that I was a little bit short of what was required in this job. The first person I have to be honest with is myself. \"In the first half when he gambled on defender Gareth Southgate in midfield I knew things were not right but couldn't find in myself a way of solving them.\"",

We accept responsibility for this but the commission is not and never has been biased in favour of or against either bid.\" </p> <p>Ms Spicer also insisted that the commission would treat both bids fairly. \"The commission is taking all steps to ensure Camelot can have confidence that the process it is following, one that Camelot sought and was granted by the high court, is fair and that they can accept the judge's view that the commission still intended to act with scrupulous fairness. </p> <p>\"We are engaging in constructive dialogue with Camelot on the detail of its proposals and we are confident this can continue.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Downing Street faced fresh embarrassment last night when the national lottery regulator warned that the new service could be delayed until 2002, jeopardising millions of pounds earmarked for good causes. Less than 24 hours after the arts minister, Alan Howarth, insisted that the new operator would be in place by next September, the lottery commission said that there could be a four month delay until early 2002. The contradictory signals added to the growing sense of confusion over the future of the lottery ahead of November's deadline for appointing a new operator. At a briefing yesterday, the lottery commission said the present operator, Camelot, may be asked to run the lottery for an extra four months next year if the new licence is awarded to Sir Richard Branson's rival People's Lottery. The briefing appeared to contradict a statement from the commission earlier yesterday when it said the timetable for the new lottery was \"tight but achievable\". Sir Richard has said that he needs a year's notice to set up the lottery, which means that Camelot will be asked to step in for a further two months if the commission accepts his bid by this November's deadline. If Camelot challenges such a decision in the courts, the delay could be even longer. A delay would mean less money being allocated to the lottery good causes because Sir Richard has promised to hand over more money than Camelot. An extension of Camelot's licence would also be hugely expensive. Its lease on its headquarters runs out next September and it also has 1,500 contracts which would have to be renegotiated. Mr Howarth had said on Thursday that the new operator would be in place by next September's deadline. \"The process is back on track and there is absolutely no case for speculation that it will not be possible to complete the processes in time.\" The lottery commission delivered another blow to ministers last night when its members spoke of their decision to sack government-appointed solicitors. Dame Helena Shovelton, the commission's former chair, sparked a row in August when she rejected the Camelot bid on the basis of advice from the treasury solicitors. Her decision was overturned by the high court, which prompted the commission to appoint the city law firm Freshfields as its new legal advisers. Brian Pomeroy, a commission member, yesterday attacked the orginal advice from the treasury solicitors as \"defective and calamitous\". His criticism was a blow to the attorney general, Lord William of Mostyn, who appoints treasury solicitors. Harriet Spicer, who succeeded Dame Helena as the commission's chairwoman this week, yesterday apologised to Camelot. Ms Spicer, who is now negotiating with Camelot and Sir Richard's group, said: \"The commission is sorry that although it set out to be fair the consequences of its actions were that it acted unfairly. We accept responsibility for this but the commission is not and never has been biased in favour of or against either bid.\" Ms Spicer also insisted that the commission would treat both bids fairly. \"The commission is taking all steps to ensure Camelot can have confidence that the process it is following, one that Camelot sought and was granted by the high court, is fair and that they can accept the judge's view that the commission still intended to act with scrupulous fairness. \"We are engaging in constructive dialogue with Camelot on the detail of its proposals and we are confident this can continue.\"",

Many visitors, I imagine, see it as a symbol of defiance: a shining beacon to tell the world that even here, in the city that gave birth to the Final Solution, there is still a testimonial Jewish presence. Until a few years ago that was indeed the case. No more than a few thousand Jews chose to remain in Berlin after 1945 and over the years their numbers crept up but slowly. Today, however, if the dome of the synagogue stands for anything it is not so much survival as revival. In the past 10 years Berlin's Jewish population has doubled to 12,000 as Jews have flooded in from the former Soviet Union, where open anti-semitism is rife. Their immigration is encouraged by the German government. Applicants receive preferential treatment similar to that given to ethnic Germans. The authorities would like nothing better than to see the Jewish community rebuilt, undoing one of the main effects of the Holocaust. And, for the moment, they are getting their way. Implausible as it may seem, Germany now has the world's fastest-growing Jewish community and the third-biggest in Europe, numbering about 85,000. This week, however, their leader, Paul Spiegel, asked an extraordinary question: whether it is all worth it? whether, to use his exact words, \"It is right for Jews to stay in Germany\"? What prompted him to voice his doubt was a string of outrages coinciding with some of the holiest days in the Jewish calender. It began here in Berlin last Saturday, when two naked men tried to disrupt a service for Rosh Hashana, the Jewish new year. The latest incident occurred on Thursday night when stones were thrown at a synagogue in the Kreuzberg district of the city, breaking two windows. In between, a synagogue in D\u00fcsseldorf was attacked and a Jewish cemetery in Potsdam defiled. Underlying the gloom imbuing Mr Spiegel's remarks is the fact that none of this is particularly unusual. The D\u00fcsseldorf incident earned attention because it took place as Germans were preparing to celebrate the 10th anniversary of reunification. But, according to the police, there are on average seven anti-semitic incidents every four days. The politicians' invariable reaction to such outbreaks is to call for more \"civil courage\". The chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, who visited the D\u00fcsseldorf synagogue on Wednesday, used the occasion to declare: \"There can be no more looking away.\" But whether that historically resonant approach addresses the true nature of the problem is questionable. A couple of peculiarities stand out. One is that, whereas attacks on immigrants are concentrated in the formerly communist east, anti-semitic incidents are more evenly distributed. The other is that the number of incidents is out of all proportion to the strength of the German far right. It would suggest that either an anti-Jewish feeling lingers among many more Germans than are ready to vote for a return to the past or other factors are at work. The potential for publicity is an obvious candidate. An attack on a prominent Jewish site in Germany is guaranteed a notoriety far beyond the degree of violence employed. Not that any of that matters much to Germany's Jews. For them, normal life will not be possible while their memorials, schools, cemeteries and places of worship are under constant siege.

      "body": "<p>A decade ago Timothy Mo left London for a short trip to east Asia. Since then, the thrice Booker-shortlisted author has spent no more than five months in Britain. \"At 20 I thought I'd live the rest of my life here,\" he says. \"But England isn't the centre any more. What's interesting about these times, and what I write about, is the clash of cultures, the war of civilisations.\" </p> <p>Mo, whose Cantonese father and English mother moved from Hong Kong to London when he was 10, was hailed as a rising literary star of the 1980s alongside Martin Amis, Salman Rushdie and Kazuo Ishiguro. His debut after Oxford, The Monkey King (1978), was a post-war Hong Kong comedy of manners, whose Mr Poon, with his gold stashed up a chimney, was modelled on Mo's grandfather - \"the only person I ever put absolutely from life in a novel\". His next novel, Sour Sweet (1982), trawled Hong Kong migrant life in Soho's Chinatown, and in An Insular Possession (1986), he looked at deeper Anglo-Chinese conflict in 19th-century Hong Kong. </p> <p>In his house in Holland Park, Mo says he finds Britain \"antiseptic - a slow, safe, orderly society\", and is more interested in societies \"glowing with decay ... I feel so much more at home in an Asian street: people smile, everybody's about my size - that was obviously nagging at me subliminally\". Each year he spends \"three months in Hong Kong; four split between Bangkok and Phnom Penh; and five in the Philippines\", travelling with his Filipina partner, Lisa, and their seven-year-old daughter, Marie. </p> <p>His fictional terrain has expanded partly through an evolving intimacy with Asia. The Redundancy of Courage (1991), on Indonesian genocide and guerrilla resistance in a veiled East Timor, was shortlisted for the Booker, as were his previous two novels. But it shocked some critics in abandoning what one termed \"quaint ethnic vignettes\" for \"violent polemic\". Mo attributes his leap to growing confidence, rejecting the pressure to \"stay in my box\". </p> <p>A former amateur bantam-weight boxer and fight reporter with an abiding passion for diving, he was perhaps too neatly accused of pugnacity when attacked for self-publishing his fifth novel, Brownout on Breadfruit Boulevard (1995). A Swiftian, scatological satire on corruption in the Philippines, it came out from his own Paddleless Press. Hectored for demanding inflated advances, he talked of \"casting pearls before swine\", but he has no regrets. \"I jumped before I was pushed. Multinationals will just stop publishing literary fiction. I'll never go back to being published by anyone else.\" </p> <p>His sixth and most recent novel, Renegade or Halo 2, which won the James Tait Black memorial prize, also opens in the Philippines, in the Marcos era, but grows into a 20th-century migrant's picaresque, spanning Asia, the Gulf emirates and Cuba, via Plaistow. Packed with action - much of it chillingly brutal - it is propelled less by plot than by sizzling prose. </p> <p>In its vivid tales of boat people and stowaways, the novel suggests first-hand experience of a global underclass of migrants - often the detritus of empire - who live several lifetimes in one. \"I've had to knock around with people who live strange zig-zag lives and have been marooned by the tide,\" says Mo. \"Seamen, domestics, boxers - people very much of this time.\" While Sour Sweet was compared to Dickens, Renegade nods to the \"ghosts of Fielding and Sterne\". </p> <p>Like the author, Renegade 's picaro, Rey Castro, embodies a collision of genes and histories. The Jesuit-educated, \"African-American-Filipino\" offspring of a bar girl and a black serviceman from the US naval base, he feels \"out of context\" everywhere. Yet he calls himself after a multicoloured local dessert, halo-halo: \"ingredients that shouldn't belong together but work when you combine them [like] candied napalm\". </p> <p>Mo himself feels \"mixed\" only in his work. \"If I'm with English people, I feel a little white man, while with my Chinese family I feel an Asian. But as a novelist, the parts have combined.\" Renegade 's compelling comic voice fuses American slang with pinoy patois and the Tagalog hybrid \"Taglish\". </p> <p>While Renegade won critical praise, it apparently split last year's Booker judges, the women refusing to countenance it on the shortlist, not least for a graphic rape-murder by Filipino fraternity \"Frat Brods\" in which Rey is uneasily complicit. Mo defends the scene as a \"regular occurrence, where rich sons of powerful people get together and rape, often murder, a poor girl; it's not just my warped imagination. I'm interested in moral dilemmas: the cultural imperative is you stick by your group, which Rey does but is haunted by it; [the girl's] ghost haunts the novel\". The book, he adds, is \"a critique of social culture; it's a weakness of south-east Asian societies that the rich should be able to abuse the poor\". </p> <p>Some thought the novel marred by provocative stereotypes - the pilfering Filipino, the lubricious Cubana. \"I'm not frightened of the word stereotype,\" says Mo. \"It's a survival blueprint: groups behave in predictable ways. But it's important to have an open mind and be ready to modify your opinion. Race and cultural differences are a great 20th-century taboo. But it is possible to make value judgments.\" </p> <p>While the author-publisher frets that \"the days of the physical book are numbered\", he says: \"Some say I don't have a natural readership for my themes. But I console myself I will years from now: there'll be more halo-halos like myself.\" </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501190357,00.htm\">Buy Brownout on Breadfruit Boulevard at BOL</a><br>501190357</p>",

This is the second volume of his encyclopaedic biography of Hitler, and the best thing in it is his treatment of Hitler's effect on the German people. He intersperses his biography with evidence of German popular sentiment, fragmentary and yet telling. </p> <p>Many Germans (perhaps understandably) have tried to separate the history of Hitler from the history of the German people during the Third Reich, one historian going so far as to declare that there were no National Socialists, there was only Hitler. This is nonsense, and Kershaw knows it very well. The great majority of the Germans followed Hitler until the very end. </p> <p>Kershaw's Hitler is more telling about the Third Reich than about the man himself. The result is a one-dimensional portrait, and not an illuminating one. This is a pity, because we shall see more and more studies of Hitler (including, I fear, more and more cleverly composed and carefully disguised apologies). There is not one trace of defence or apology here, and Kershaw makes the much-needed and persuasive argument that even when no evidence of direct orders exists, there is no reason to think that his minions were committing their brutalities contrary to, or even without, Hitler's wishes. </p> <p>But Kershaw's portrait of Hitler is that of a single-minded fanatic with crazy ideas who was doomed to defeat. It was not as simple as that. Hitler was no fool, and his abilities as statesman and strategist derived from the same talents that had enabled him to become ruler of Germany. These talents were protean - for instance, his uncanny capacity to foretell what his enemies would not do. </p> <p>Kershaw does not see how close Hitler came to winning the war, not only in the summer of 1940 but in 1941. His knowledge does not extend sufficiently to Hitler's adversaries, or to foreign policy. After November-December 1941 Hitler could no longer win the second world war, but he could still prevail by not losing it. Had he driven Stalin beyond the Volga, forcing an armistice of sorts, or thrown the Anglo-American armies into the sea in 1944, he would not have won the war, but one or other of his enemies would have been compelled to make some kind of arrangement with him. He knew that, and in December 1941 his entire strategy changed. He now faced a long war, and believed that sooner or later the uneasy and unnatural coalition of his enemies, capitalists and communists, would break apart. (He was right; but, fortunately, too late for him.) He also knew that this could not be achieved by diplomacy, but by striking a decisive blow against one of his enemies. At the same time he gave the command of German industry to Speer, turning it into an astonishingly successful and productive war economy. There is almost nothing in Kershaw's book about this momentous change in Hitler's strategy. Nor is there anything about Hitler's attempts to divide the Allies. </p> <p>Kershaw begins the present volume by summing up his first one: in the 1930s Hitler \"was a political outsider with few, if any, special talents beyond undoubted skills as a demagogue and propagandist\". Yet in his foreign policy before 1939 \"his sense of timing ha[d] been excellent, his combination of bluff and blackmail effective, his manipulation of propaganda to back his coups masterly\". Another contradiction, within one page: \"He was certainly alert to the dangers of a collapse in his popularity, and the likely domestic crisis which would then occur.\" Yet: \"It is, in fact, doubtful whether he would have believed the accounts of poor morale, even if he had read them.\" By 1936 Hitler \"had thought himself infallible; his self-image had reached the stage of outright hubris\". Yet in November 1936 Hitler said to Speer, after a long silence: \"If I succeed, I will be one of the greatest men in history - if I fail, I will be condemned, rejected, and damned.\" </p> <p>This volume is not well written: there are many errors of facts and dates, and strange words such as \"devotalia\", \"actionism\", \"diplomatic outfall\". The other main shortcoming is Kershaw's extensive dependence on Hitler's statements as his primary source. The problem here is not only that Hitler, despite his loquacity, was a very secretive man (as he himself states on occasion); we must also keep in mind that he was a master of the spoken word (again, something which he often emphasised). The great turning point of his life came in 1919: his decision to enter politics was contemporaneous with his discovery that he was a very efficient speaker. Thereafter, he always spoke with the purpose of influencing his hearers, not only in his public speeches but also in table conversations and talks with Goebbels, on whose diaries Kershaw sometimes unduly depends. Did Hitler always believe what he was saying? Kershaw writes as though he did, yet we have evidence to the contrary. </p> <p>This is especially so in the case of Russia. Kershaw writes that in the 1930s Hitler was \"increasingly preoccupied with the looming threat, as he saw it, from Bolshevism\". Not at all: Hitler gave little thought to Soviet Russia until 1939, but he very ably used the threat of Bolshevism to impress conservatives in Germany and Britain. Several times during the war Hitler praised Stalin for having got rid of the influence of Jews. Yet in all his public statements, including the last ones in April 1945, he proclaimed the peril of \"Jewish Bolshevism\". </p> <p>It is the great merit of British writing to have married biography to history. In the 19th century, professional historians tended to eschew biography. The English tradition was an exception, with enduring results during the 20th century, to the extent that the appetite of the public for serious biographies is now larger than ever before, and every serious biographer now follows the practices of historical research. Still, biography requires particular talents, including not only a certain degree of empathy with one's subject but an incisive understanding of human nature. Kershaw is a better historian than he is a biographer. </p> <p> \u0095 John Lukacs's latest book, The Hitler of History, will be published in January by Weidenfeld.</p>",

The English tradition was an exception, with enduring results during the 20th century, to the extent that the appetite of the public for serious biographies is now larger than ever before, and every serious biographer now follows the practices of historical research. Still, biography requires particular talents, including not only a certain degree of empathy with one's subject but an incisive understanding of human nature. Kershaw is a better historian than he is a biographer. \u0095 John Lukacs's latest book, The Hitler of History, will be published in January by Weidenfeld.",

That was when she came to the attention of Henry VIII. </p> <p><strong> Distinguishing features: </strong> This young widow in her black mourning gown has an amazing presence, a quiet confidence and strength. Holbein has painted her full-length, adding to the illusion she is here in the room; you think of ghostly Tudors gliding though oak-panelled rooms at midnight. She smiles, as if at a secret, a look which both seduces and excludes the viewer. There's a dignity and subtle authority to the way she presents herself. </p> <p>She has removed her gloves, which suggests intimacy. Her face is friendly, but she wears mourning, which Holbein makes darkly glamorous with light shining on the black silk. This was pretty much how Henry VIII must have felt when Holbein showed him the portrait the king had commis sioned of the woman he was considering marrying without ever having met her as was his practice. Holbein, his salaried court painter, travelled to Brussels to draw Christina before producing this painting. The latest of Henry's wives, Jane Seymour, had died in childbirth, so he was looking for another. Holbein's paintings are some of the most acutely realistic of the Renaissance; he seems to have associated his meticulous representation with the recognition of mortality. </p> <p>Henry had Holbein paint Christina and it was said that when he saw Holbein's portrait he fell in love with her - but that was as far as it went.

      "bodyText": "\u00b7 View the work online Artist: Hans Holbein the Younger (1497/8-1543), German-born painter and draughtsman of the Dance of Death who came to Britain, was appointed court artist to Henry VIII and painted some of the most uncannily lifelike portraits in the history of art. Subject: Christina of Denmark (1522-1590), younger daughter of King Christian II of Denmark, married by proxy at the age of eleven to the Duke of Milan; when he died in 1535 the 16-year old widow became one of the most eligible brides in Europe. That was when she came to the attention of Henry VIII. Distinguishing features: This young widow in her black mourning gown has an amazing presence, a quiet confidence and strength. Holbein has painted her full-length, adding to the illusion she is here in the room; you think of ghostly Tudors gliding though oak-panelled rooms at midnight. She smiles, as if at a secret, a look which both seduces and excludes the viewer. There's a dignity and subtle authority to the way she presents herself. She has removed her gloves, which suggests intimacy. Her face is friendly, but she wears mourning, which Holbein makes darkly glamorous with light shining on the black silk. This was pretty much how Henry VIII must have felt when Holbein showed him the portrait the king had commis sioned of the woman he was considering marrying without ever having met her as was his practice. Holbein, his salaried court painter, travelled to Brussels to draw Christina before producing this painting. The latest of Henry's wives, Jane Seymour, had died in childbirth, so he was looking for another. Holbein's paintings are some of the most acutely realistic of the Renaissance; he seems to have associated his meticulous representation with the recognition of mortality. Henry had Holbein paint Christina and it was said that when he saw Holbein's portrait he fell in love with her - but that was as far as it went. She instead married Fran\u00e7ois Duc de Bar in 1541 and when he died in 1545, she became Regent of Lorraine. Later the same year Henry sent him to draw Anne of Cleves, another marital candidate. Henry was convinced by Holbein's portrait to marry Anne but when she came to England he was dismally disappointed. He called her a fat Flanders mare. Holbein died five years later of the plague. Inspirations and influences: Holbein's great predecessor was Albrecht D\u00fcrer (1471-1528), whose engraving of the Humanist intellectual Philipp Melanchthon (1526) is one of the key portraits of the Renaissance in its intense study of character.

      "body": "<p>The dining room at the Crown was empty that particular lunchtime. The petrol blockades were at their height, which didn't help, and then there was the position of the Crown itself, tucked away in one of the clefts that seam the steep, heavily wooded sides of the Wye valley, south-west of Monmouth. </p> <p>You have to work at getting to the Crown, and so, if you're a bit doubtful about the petrol supplies, you could be tempted to give this lunchtime's beanfeast a miss on the grounds that you might make it there, but you might not make it back again. </p> <p>Not that to have to stay over would be a disaster, because the Crown advertises itself as a restaurant with rooms, a pleasantly old-fashioned and rather French notion. It suggests that the emphasis is on the food rather than the frills and furbelows of modern hoteliery, and while I like my bedtime comforts as well as the next sleeper, I like the comforts of the table even more. Anyway, I don't suppose that the Crown was too disturbed by not being overrun one lunchtime in a while. When you have survived 30 or so years in such a position, you must be used to every vicissitude in the trade. </p> <p>This length of service gives the Crown a certain gravitas, a calm certainty about what it is up to. The beamed dining room, for example, is pleasant and proper, neither cloddishly rustic or oppressively smart. The basics of tablecloths, napkins, glasses all have the weight and heft of fine quality, but the service has a fresh and personable charm. I might be the only person in the place, but I didn't feel like a sad solitary. Lunch trickled by in an agreeable fashion, my reading of the day's paper broken by the intermittent arrival of courses. </p> <p>Mark Turton, the Crown's chef, is a graduate of the Roux brothers' school of culinary excellence. The Roux brothers were - indeed, still are - sticklers for the basics. Their cooking is founded on the classics principles of la cuisine Fran\u00e7aise: sauces are based on stocks; meat is served pink; vegetables play second (if not third or fourth) fiddle to the big protein number; pastry is an art form. The dishes have a certain - what shall we say? - weight to them: handsome Victorian mahogany rather than lightweight bleached pine Ikea. You do not look to the Roux brothers, or to their disciples, for novelty or fantasy. </p> <p>But then, novelty or fantasy would not suit the Crown one little bit. So I had three courses of highly satisfying, mostly beautifully prepared food from a menu that generously offered two courses for \u00a312.95 and three for \u00a315.95. The three courses were a ravioli of leek and St David's cheese in a wild mushroom risotto with a beurre blanc sauce; noisette of lamb with spinach pancakes and walnut jus; and savarin soaked in strawberry syrup with a warm fruit compote. </p> <p>Now, there's nothing startling about that lot. You could argue that a chap eating on his own could not explore the full majesty of the menu, and, of course, you'd be right. But it isn't my intention to explore the full majesty of any menu, but to replicate, as far as is possible, the experience of anyone walking in off the hills. Anyway, when you've been eating 200 or so restaurant meals a year for 10 years, you know what a chef's cooking is like from the way he lays out a menu. Don't ask me why, but you just do. </p> <p>The first course was disarmingly rich, a very French interpretation of Italian cooking, making use of local ingredients. The ravioli was a fine piece of pasta, cooked to teasingly soft perfection, the leek dominating the cheese.

      "bodyText": "The dining room at the Crown was empty that particular lunchtime. The petrol blockades were at their height, which didn't help, and then there was the position of the Crown itself, tucked away in one of the clefts that seam the steep, heavily wooded sides of the Wye valley, south-west of Monmouth. You have to work at getting to the Crown, and so, if you're a bit doubtful about the petrol supplies, you could be tempted to give this lunchtime's beanfeast a miss on the grounds that you might make it there, but you might not make it back again. Not that to have to stay over would be a disaster, because the Crown advertises itself as a restaurant with rooms, a pleasantly old-fashioned and rather French notion. It suggests that the emphasis is on the food rather than the frills and furbelows of modern hoteliery, and while I like my bedtime comforts as well as the next sleeper, I like the comforts of the table even more. Anyway, I don't suppose that the Crown was too disturbed by not being overrun one lunchtime in a while. When you have survived 30 or so years in such a position, you must be used to every vicissitude in the trade. This length of service gives the Crown a certain gravitas, a calm certainty about what it is up to. The beamed dining room, for example, is pleasant and proper, neither cloddishly rustic or oppressively smart. The basics of tablecloths, napkins, glasses all have the weight and heft of fine quality, but the service has a fresh and personable charm. I might be the only person in the place, but I didn't feel like a sad solitary. Lunch trickled by in an agreeable fashion, my reading of the day's paper broken by the intermittent arrival of courses. Mark Turton, the Crown's chef, is a graduate of the Roux brothers' school of culinary excellence. The Roux brothers were - indeed, still are - sticklers for the basics. Their cooking is founded on the classics principles of la cuisine Fran\u00e7aise: sauces are based on stocks; meat is served pink; vegetables play second (if not third or fourth) fiddle to the big protein number; pastry is an art form. The dishes have a certain - what shall we say? - weight to them: handsome Victorian mahogany rather than lightweight bleached pine Ikea. You do not look to the Roux brothers, or to their disciples, for novelty or fantasy. But then, novelty or fantasy would not suit the Crown one little bit. So I had three courses of highly satisfying, mostly beautifully prepared food from a menu that generously offered two courses for \u00a312.95 and three for \u00a315.95. The three courses were a ravioli of leek and St David's cheese in a wild mushroom risotto with a beurre blanc sauce; noisette of lamb with spinach pancakes and walnut jus; and savarin soaked in strawberry syrup with a warm fruit compote. Now, there's nothing startling about that lot. You could argue that a chap eating on his own could not explore the full majesty of the menu, and, of course, you'd be right. But it isn't my intention to explore the full majesty of any menu, but to replicate, as far as is possible, the experience of anyone walking in off the hills. Anyway, when you've been eating 200 or so restaurant meals a year for 10 years, you know what a chef's cooking is like from the way he lays out a menu. Don't ask me why, but you just do. The first course was disarmingly rich, a very French interpretation of Italian cooking, making use of local ingredients. The ravioli was a fine piece of pasta, cooked to teasingly soft perfection, the leek dominating the cheese. I rather doubt that the rice in the risotto was the traditional arborio, but it was generously larded with diced wild mushrooms, which tasted as if they might, indeed, have grown underneath a tree rather than a polytunnel. And the beurre blanc was a model of that sauce, gently astringent and silky with butter. The lamb dish continued this level of cheerful indulgence. The lamb was local, and carried plenty of colour in terms of flavour. It needed all of that to stand up to an almost intimidating sauce based on a red-wine reduction given further clout by chopped walnuts. The half-bottle of warming Gigondas to which I limited myself had the measure of the dish perfectly. The pancakes suffered a little in this taste blitzkrieg, but had their part to play. I wasn't convinced that a side issue of six further vegetables - namely, red cabbage, gratin dauphinois, carrots, courgette and celeriac batons in a filo basket, and French beans - really did, even though they were adequately cooked. It was the kind of supernumerary dish demanded by local clientele rather than by the kitchen. But the savarin was a serious disappointment.

Such is the New Zealand Chionochloa flavescens (1.2m): plants are on offer, but we raised ours from seed a few years ago. Its pale, arching flower heads are the whole point, developing in early summer and still going strong now. They are quite broad and create a beautiful feature, either on their own or in mixed plantings, although they should never be crowded in. C. conspicua (2m) is similar, although taller, and makes a splendid solo feature in gravel.

The panicles are fluffed-out brushes, dark when fresh with a hint of mauve in them but fading to buff, as so many grasses do. This is new to me and I am pleased with it. </p> <p> Panicum virgatum 'Rubrum' (1.2m) - and there are several similar cultivars - comes into its own only in early autumn, but will last the winter in good condition. It is all billowing airiness, making clouds of tiny flower heads, self-supporting and with foliage that, in this case, changes to reddish tints. The plant is more solid than you might suppose, and is therefore best sited in a border's middle range. </p> <p>Most molinia are best seen rising higher than their surroundings, and I generally like to see them as solo clumps. The two tall ones that I grow (they are at their best now, in full flower, although they become interesting from late June on) are Molinia caerulea subsp . arundinacea 'Windspiel' (2m) and 'Transparent' (2m), both of which we have on border promontories. The flowering stems rise way above the foliage, although in 'Transparent' this is a trifle mundane. I think I should do well to have some round-leaved bergenia growing in front of it. Molinias are strange inasmuch as all their top growth breaks away from the base at some point in November and needs to be cleared away. No winter effect from them. </p> <p>Among miscanthus, there is a wonderful range of goodies, both on account of their flowers and foliage. The most recent that I have been introduced to and brought under my care is Miscanthus nepalensis (0.9m), as a flowering plant. It has very drooping panicles of silky texture and pale buff colouring. Happily surviving three winters in my friend's garden, it is yet said to be on the tender side. In such cases, it is best to go ahead and give a plant its chance. You may get years of pleasure from it before it succumbs - if it ever does. And if it does, for God's sake don't moan. You're no true gardener if you're not prepared to take risks. </p> <p>With its longitudinal white stripes, M. sinensis 'Variegatus' (2m) has long been one of our favourites, as it makes an elegant fountain of foliage (again, don't crowd it in) that is visible at a considerable distance, but it does sometimes need a little support. 'Cosmopolitan', which has broader foliage, is highly rated for the same reasons. 'Morning Light' (1.5m), on the other hand, has very narrow, white-margined leaves, so is a good choice for the smaller garden or as a distinctive feature on a pond margin. </p> <p>Of the miscanthus cross-banded with yellow, giving them the popular name of zebra grass, there are several - my favourite of these is M. sinensis 'Strictus' (2m), which is of outstandingly upright habit. I like to see it rising above my hydrangea plantings, which are of contrasting rounded habit. 'Zebrinus' is similarly marked, but is a more spreading plant, with arching foliage, that looks best with pondside plantings of, say, Gunnera tinctoria and Eupatorium purpureum . </p> <p>A flowering M. sinensis that has received accolades is 'Malepartus' (2m). Its bronzy-purple flowers are borne above exceptionally rigid, upright stems, so this is a good mixer with other perennials. I like it with the pale yellow sunflower, Helianthus 'Lemon Queen' (2m), and with a pink Japanese anemone in front of both. On its own, the miscanthus looks less good, especially in winter. M. sinensis 'Flamingo' (1.5m) has shown up well as a flowering plant in trials at Wisley, flowering abundantly in early autumn. It is a rich purplish colouring at first, before later bleaching, as do the rest of them. </p> <p>If you grow these flowering miscanthus in a reasonably sheltered position, they'll look pleasing well into early winter. Whether you can stand their heavy moult of foliage at the turn of the year, however, is a personal matter</p>",

Those luminaries feeling miffed at exclusion might feel even worse when they hear that, apparently, there were no big names among the close contenders - one who just missed out was Anne Enright, with What Are You Like? On the day, though, thumping great stories proved favourite with a panel that split 3-2 over each book included. \"Narrative energy\" was the thing and, according to one insider, much appreciated by Mariella Frostrup. </p> <p>\u0095 English Passengers, the shortlisted title from Matthew Kneale, was not one of those novels touted in the run-up to Booker day, as the Guardian's local bookshop will testify. Metropolitan Books had eight copies, but they remained in the window for so long that their covers faded, so the disappointed proprietor finally sent them back. No doubt a despatch from Hamish Hamilton is winging its way towards him as we speak. </p> <p> \u0095 The judges' insistence on calling in books that they felt had been overlooked paid dividends for Trezza Azzopardi's The Hiding Place, the only book not to have been submitted originally by its publishers - and the first title ever summoned in this way to make it on to the shortlist.

      "bodyText": "\u0095 Bomb scares and gridlocks ensured that the early-morning press conference at Iceland plc headquarters to announce the Booker Prize shortlist was a fairly sweaty and harrassed affair - for the assembled hacks at least, if not for the groomed and primped judges. The list, when it came, was greeted with a few murmurs of surprise - no Ballard, Banville, Zadie Smith or Muriel Spark, to name but a few - and puzzled looks over one author, Brian O'Doherty, who seemed to ring no bells at all. Those luminaries feeling miffed at exclusion might feel even worse when they hear that, apparently, there were no big names among the close contenders - one who just missed out was Anne Enright, with What Are You Like? On the day, though, thumping great stories proved favourite with a panel that split 3-2 over each book included. \"Narrative energy\" was the thing and, according to one insider, much appreciated by Mariella Frostrup. \u0095 English Passengers, the shortlisted title from Matthew Kneale, was not one of those novels touted in the run-up to Booker day, as the Guardian's local bookshop will testify. Metropolitan Books had eight copies, but they remained in the window for so long that their covers faded, so the disappointed proprietor finally sent them back. No doubt a despatch from Hamish Hamilton is winging its way towards him as we speak. \u0095 The judges' insistence on calling in books that they felt had been overlooked paid dividends for Trezza Azzopardi's The Hiding Place, the only book not to have been submitted originally by its publishers - and the first title ever summoned in this way to make it on to the shortlist. If you fancy a flutter, the Loafer's favourite literary tipster advises backing the woman whose name would spell immediate victory in any game of Scrabble - at 7/1 the outsider and \"the value bet\".

Mr Cheney won some laughs in response to a tease from Mr Lieberman about how much better off he was after eight years of the Democrats - a reference to the millions Mr Cheney has made in the private sector. \"I can tell you, Joe, that the government had absolutely nothing to do with it,\" he said. Mr Lieberman said that he could see his wife in the audience and thought she must be wishing that he, too, would go into the private sector. \"I'm going to try and help you do that, Joe,\" Mr Cheney said.

Both eschewed personal attacks until the end of the 90-minute debate, when Mr Cheney took a sideswipe at Mr Lieberman for attending a Hollywood fundraiser at which a comedian made a joke about George W Bush's religion. Mr Lieberman, who made frequent references to God - almost as frequent as his 18 references to \"Al Gore and I\" - deplored the joke but refrained from making any cracks about Mr Cheney . Each referred to the other by his first name throughout and they paid fulsome compliments to one another. While Mr Rather said that it was perhaps not a debate to listen to if you were operating heavy machinery, the general response was that it had been civilised, that it had shown Mr Cheney to be less of a conservative hardliner than his image, and had emphasised Mr Lieberman's tendency to make jokes to defuse a situation.

      "body": "<p>This is an edited version of Tony Blair's speech in Warsaw:</p> <p>The European Union is on the brink of one of the most important decisions in its history. Enlargement to the east may be the EU's greatest challenge, but I also believe it is its greatest opportunity.</p> <p>Nobody who considers how the EU has underpinned peace and democracy in the reconstruction of postwar western Europe can doubt the benefits that enlargement will bring post-cold war Europe and the Balkans. Nobody who considers the role that open markets have played in generating wealth and prosperity in the EU can doubt the benefits of creating a market of half a billion consumers.</p> <p>Without enlargement, western Europe will always be faced with the threat of instability, conflict and mass migration on its borders. Without enlargement, the political consensus behind economic and political reform in the weaker transition countries may splinter.</p> <p>So I am determined there should be a breakthrough on enlargement under the Swedish presidency. I will be urging political leaders to commit themselves to a framework leading to an early end of the negotiations. I want to see new member states participating in the European parliamentary elections in 2004 and having a seat at the next IGC [inter-governmental conference].</p> <p><b> Britain in Europe</b></p> <p>Britain will always be a staunch ally of all those European democracies applying to join the EU; a staunch ally wielding its influence at the centre of Europe.</p> <p>It was not always like that. British policy towards the rest of Europe over half a century has been marked by gross misjudgments, mistaking what we wanted to be the case with what was the case; hesitation, alienation, incomprehension, with the occasional burst of enlightened brilliance.</p> <p>I have said the political case for Britain being part of the single currency is strong. What does have to be overcome is the economic issue. Joining prematurely simply on political grounds, without the economic conditions being right, would be a mistake. Hence our position: in principle in favour; in practice the economic tests must be met. We cannot and will not take risks with Britain's economic strength.</p> <p><b> Proposals for political reform</b></p> <p>Just as governments go before their electorates and set out their agenda for the coming years, so must the European council. We need to do it in all the crucial fields of European action: economic, foreign policy, defence and the fight against cross-border crime. I am proposing today an annual agenda for Europe, set by the European council.</p> <p>We should be open to reforming the way individual councils work, perhaps through team presidencies that give the leadership of the council greater continuity and weight; greater use of elected chairs of councils and their working groups; and ensuring that the secretary general of the council, Javier Solana, can play his full role in the development of foreign and defence policy.</p> <p>For example, when Europe is more than 25 members can we seriously believe that a country will hold the presidency only every 12 or 13 years? But two or three countries together, with a mix of large and small states, might make greater sense. We may also need a better way of overseeing and monitoring the union's programme than the three-monthly European councils.</p> <p>Second, there is an important debate about a constitution for Europe. In practice I suspect that, given the sheer diversity and complexity of the EU, its constitution, like the British constitution, will continue to be found in treaties, laws and precedents.</p> <p>What I think is desirable and realistic is to draw up a statement of the principles according to which we should decide what is best done at the European level and what should be done at the national level, a kind of charter of competences. This would allow coun tries, too, to define clearly what is then done at a regional level. This statement of principles would be a political, not a legal document. It could therefore be much simpler and more accessible to Europe's citizens.</p> <p>The time has come to involve representatives of national parliaments more on such matters, by creating a second chamber of the European parliament. Its most important function would be to review the EU's work, in the light of the statement of principles.</p> <p>This would be political review by a body of democratically elected politicians. It would be dynamic, allowing for change in the application of these principles without elaborate legal revisions every time.</p> <p><b> Conclusion</b></p> <p>Our task, with the help of the new democracies about to join, is to shape a responsive European Union - in touch with the people, transparent and easier to understand, strengthened by its nations and regions, an EU whose vision of peace is matched by its vision of prosperity; a civilised continent united in defeating brutality and violence; a continent joined in its belief in social justice. A superpower, but not a superstate. An economic powerhouse through the completion of the world's biggest single market, the extension of competition, an adaptable and well educated workforce, the support for businesses large and small.</p>",

Enlargement to the east may be the EU's greatest challenge, but I also believe it is its greatest opportunity. Nobody who considers how the EU has underpinned peace and democracy in the reconstruction of postwar western Europe can doubt the benefits that enlargement will bring post-cold war Europe and the Balkans. Nobody who considers the role that open markets have played in generating wealth and prosperity in the EU can doubt the benefits of creating a market of half a billion consumers. Without enlargement, western Europe will always be faced with the threat of instability, conflict and mass migration on its borders. Without enlargement, the political consensus behind economic and political reform in the weaker transition countries may splinter. So I am determined there should be a breakthrough on enlargement under the Swedish presidency. I will be urging political leaders to commit themselves to a framework leading to an early end of the negotiations. I want to see new member states participating in the European parliamentary elections in 2004 and having a seat at the next IGC [inter-governmental conference]. Britain in Europe Britain will always be a staunch ally of all those European democracies applying to join the EU; a staunch ally wielding its influence at the centre of Europe. It was not always like that. British policy towards the rest of Europe over half a century has been marked by gross misjudgments, mistaking what we wanted to be the case with what was the case; hesitation, alienation, incomprehension, with the occasional burst of enlightened brilliance. I have said the political case for Britain being part of the single currency is strong. What does have to be overcome is the economic issue. Joining prematurely simply on political grounds, without the economic conditions being right, would be a mistake. Hence our position: in principle in favour; in practice the economic tests must be met. We cannot and will not take risks with Britain's economic strength. Proposals for political reform Just as governments go before their electorates and set out their agenda for the coming years, so must the European council. We need to do it in all the crucial fields of European action: economic, foreign policy, defence and the fight against cross-border crime. I am proposing today an annual agenda for Europe, set by the European council. We should be open to reforming the way individual councils work, perhaps through team presidencies that give the leadership of the council greater continuity and weight; greater use of elected chairs of councils and their working groups; and ensuring that the secretary general of the council, Javier Solana, can play his full role in the development of foreign and defence policy. For example, when Europe is more than 25 members can we seriously believe that a country will hold the presidency only every 12 or 13 years? But two or three countries together, with a mix of large and small states, might make greater sense. We may also need a better way of overseeing and monitoring the union's programme than the three-monthly European councils. Second, there is an important debate about a constitution for Europe. In practice I suspect that, given the sheer diversity and complexity of the EU, its constitution, like the British constitution, will continue to be found in treaties, laws and precedents. What I think is desirable and realistic is to draw up a statement of the principles according to which we should decide what is best done at the European level and what should be done at the national level, a kind of charter of competences. This would allow coun tries, too, to define clearly what is then done at a regional level. This statement of principles would be a political, not a legal document. It could therefore be much simpler and more accessible to Europe's citizens. The time has come to involve representatives of national parliaments more on such matters, by creating a second chamber of the European parliament. Its most important function would be to review the EU's work, in the light of the statement of principles. This would be political review by a body of democratically elected politicians. It would be dynamic, allowing for change in the application of these principles without elaborate legal revisions every time. Conclusion Our task, with the help of the new democracies about to join, is to shape a responsive European Union - in touch with the people, transparent and easier to understand, strengthened by its nations and regions, an EU whose vision of peace is matched by its vision of prosperity; a civilised continent united in defeating brutality and violence; a continent joined in its belief in social justice. A superpower, but not a superstate. An economic powerhouse through the completion of the world's biggest single market, the extension of competition, an adaptable and well educated workforce, the support for businesses large and small.",

This week the ombudsman, Walter Merricks, set out the grounds where he believes complaints are valid. The overall grounds are very clear: \"Compensation is likely to be due only where (a) the endowment policy was wrongly sold at the time; and (b) a loss has resulted. Both conditions must be met,\" says Mr Merricks. </p> <p>The ombudsman is likely to examine closely your attitude to risk investments.

The insurer's safeguard is that it carried out a fact-find, that it sent you a \"reasons why\" letter and an illustration of the projected benefits, and has kept a statement from the sales representative who gave the advice. However, he noted this week that: \"The ombudsman's experience is that few firms are able to provide such complete evidence in response to a complaint.\" </p> <p>Carefully check the wording of your documents. The benefits illustration should make very clear that it is not a guarantee. If it doesn't, or hides it in very small print, it strengthens your case. </p> <p>Complaints about what a salesmen promised will be the most difficult to prove, and the ombudsman will take a view on the credibility of evidence from both parties. He says that a salesman's promise that an endowment would produce a surplus does not necessarily constitute a contract, but it may amount to misrepresentation. </p> <p>The ombudsman can award compensation in a number of different ways. These include making the insurance company top-up the endowment, or forcing it to give a binding commitment that the endowment will pay off the mortgage. </p> <p>The Financial Services Ombudsman can be contacted on 020-7964-1000, <a href=\"http://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk.\">www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk.</a> or by writing to the FSO at South Quay Plaza, 183 Marsh Wall, London E14 9SR. </p> <p><strong> Going to court</strong><br> </p> <p> Some lawyers argue that the regulatory/ombudsman route is irrelevant; endow ments are contracts that can be upheld in court.

The British Council in Washington said the Scottish university, which has always appealed to Americans, appeared to be enjoying even greater popularity since the second-in-line to the throne won a place to study history of art. It claimed there was enormous interest in Britain. The council, which promotes British universities to Americans wanting to study abroad, yesterday issued new figures showing that in the last academic year, 1999-2000, there were more than 30,000 full-time US students in the UK. Between them they brought in more than \u00a3130m in tuition fees alone. \"The UK is on a high in terms of its media profile,\" explained Jenny Scott, director of education promotion at the British Council. \"The difficulty is persuading Americans that there is life outside London, Edinburgh and Oxbridge.\" But this year, according to the university application forms which the council has sent to the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service in the UK, St Andrews has become more popular within individual students' choice of six universities, particularly among girls. The top choices remain Oxford, Cambridge, London University's Kings College, the London School of Economics and Edinburgh. Chelsea Clinton has expressed an interest in following her father Bill - once a Rhodes scholar - to Oxford, thus providing a further publicity boost. Ms Scott said that as well as the royal connection, St Andrews was marketing itself aggressively in the US. American students can choose from a wide range of options at British universities, ranging from undergraduate and postgraduate programmes or \"study abroad\", which involves one semester (equivalent of half an academic year) or a year in the UK. The US is now the largest non-EU student market, sending more students to Britain than Malaysia, Hong Kong, Singapore, India or China. Current figures from St Andrews show that 8.4% of its students are from the US, with overseas students making up 12% of its student population. The British Council said the case of Laura Spence, who has taken up a place at Harvard after being rejected by Oxford, had not attracted much publicity in the US.

      "bodyText": "A dramatic turnaround in standards within England's failing schools was revealed yesterday by the government's schools watchdog Ofsted, showing that up to 250,000 youngsters have benefited from huge improvements in the quality of teaching and leadership. The first detailed analysis of how 600 of the worst performing primary and secondary schools fared after emerging from \"special measures\" showed that after being identified as failing, the vast majority of schools had engineered a significant turnaround within two to four years. Improvements were recorded in pupil achievement as well as in standards of teaching, leadership and management, and were found to be more marked in primary schools than in secondary schools. Ministers claimed the new evidence showed that Labour's policies to raise standards in schools were working, and that it should silence those who have criticised the tough inspection regime overseen by the office for standards in education and originally introduced by the Tories. The analysis was presented by senior Ofsted officials at a bilateral conference in Washington on turning around failing schools. The US government and regional school districts are particularly interested in the role of Ofsted in monitoring and inspecting schools, as America has no comparable system. In 1993 Ofsted started its programme of inspecting and publishing a report on every school in England which receives state funding, with powers to put any school deemed to be failing or likely to fail into \"special measures\". This means the school has to produce an action plan for recovery and is subject to further monitoring by Ofsted.
