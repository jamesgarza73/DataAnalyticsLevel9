Stoke were the only other side in the top eight to win, coming from behind to beat Bury 2-1. Second-placed Walsall lost 3-1 at Swansea to leave Millwall four points clear. It was a day when some of the division's more celebrated runs were finally broken. Rotherham, the only league side to have scored in every game, were held to a 0-0 draw at home to Notts County; Wigan, unbeaten in 18 games, saw Lee Duxbury and Mark Allott secure a 2-1 win for Oldham . Cambridge United will be less upset about the end of their 13-match - winless - run, Tom Young scoring the only goal of the game against Wycombe. But Jermaine Defoe's goalscoring streak is showing no signs of letting up - the Bournemouth striker, on loan from West Ham, has scored nine goals in seven games after a brace against Oxford. Luton 's 3-2 win over Peterborough leaves Oxford seven points adrift at the bottom of the table, although Port Vale could yet challenge them for last place if their form fails to improve - a 1-0 reverse at Wrexham was their fourth defeat in succession. Chesterfield maintained their lead at the top of the Third Division with a 2-0 win over Darlington at Saltergate, the biggest win of a low-scoring day in the division.

We hired a snorkelling set for the day and, conquering my past inability to snorkel without choking on seawater, I enjoyed the afternoon swimming along reefs with a variety of strange and wonderful fish. It felt like my own tranquil world and was exactly what I needed after the night before. </p> <p>After that we took the bus - the buses in Hawaii are incredibly good value - to Sandy Beach. It was a gorgeous and amazingly empty spot with reasonable surf where we stopped to eat papaya, which I used my Swiss Army knife to slice - never leave home without one! </p> <p>The evening was kind of a dead loss as my English roommate Boe and me are under 21. We resorted to asking another hosteller to buy us a bottle of wine, which made us both feel like young children again.</p> <p>I was more than a little glad to be leaving Hawaii. I received an email through the website where someone had dubbed it the \"floating rip-off island\" - very astute. If you want my advice, do what I should have done and was told to do - get to Honolulu and head straight out again for one of the other islands. </p> <p>When I reached Sydney - at a sensible time of day for a change - it occurred to me that I'd yet again not bothered to book ahead. In the airport, there was a wall of free phones to various hostels, so I chose the Funk House, because it claimed to have a good atmosphere and I liked the name. Besides, I knew it was only for three days so I wasn't being particularly fussy. </p> <p>At first the hostel seemed nice, even though it was located in the distinctly seedy Kings Cross area, where the majority of city hostels are. Then I got to know people. I think my major problem is this: I had it so lucky with the people I met in Global Village Vancouver, I just assumed everybody would be like that. </p> <p>I guess the essential reason for my disappointment is that there are so many British people in Sydney that there isn't that great multicultural feel of Vancouver, and drinking seems to be the one and only pastime of the residents. </p> <p>Still, as someone has said to me, no one would believe you had it good all round the world. And as I say, without the lows, how can you appreciate the highs?? </p> <p>Christmas Day was spent on Bondi Beach - that night a bunch of us from the hostel went to a party on a boat. I only describe this briefly because although both were kind of fun, it's the people you're with that make any occasion and I felt I didn't have a lot in common with them. Who knows, maybe it was just a bit of Christmas homesickness making me feel that way... </p> <p>Moving swiftly on, I always think the best thing to do in a new place is to spend a day having a thorough exploration to orient yourself so it feels less alien. So it was that I spent Boxing Day doing just that, after watching the boats line up for the start of the Sydney-Hobart race. </p> <p>I happened to be sitting on the wharf down on Darling Harbour when a lad came over with a glass of wine, saying it was a present from his boat, which had just finished a private charter. I think the tipsy guests had seen me alone and felt sorry! Anyway, we got to chatting and I ended up sitting aboard La Violenta with this Dutch lad named Bob and his family and friends. </p> <p>Bob's family sail a boat for various occasions on the harbour, and just the night before they'd taken out a variety of famous English deejays who are in Sydney for New Year's Eve. I think he's just got the best life - living on a boat, and sailing to the Pacific or wherever they pleased. I don't think anything could sound more appealing - if anyone's got a boat in Sydney I'll happily go sailing with you! </p> <p>The following day I had to be at the airport early to meet my boyfriend Josh who's out here for two weeks, keeping me company. It is good timing as it also happens to be my birthday today, so this is definitely one of those highs that I described earlier. </p> <p>On the advice of one of the people from the boat yesterday we chose to stay at the Glebe Village Backpackers hostel. It's about 10 minutes out of Sydney, but the home-like atmosphere and attractive surrounds are certainly a step up from Kings Cross. We bought a birthday picnic and ate in the lovely Botanical Gardens and I guess we will go out and celebrate tonight. </p> <p>So, it's nice to end a week on a real positive note - I'm pretty sure next week will be the same, although I'd better start thinking about doing the dreaded job-hunting thing soon... </p> <p>Until next week (and the year 2001),<br>Milly</p>",

I don't know about you but I'm spending the holiday season in California.</p> <p>The journey here took 26 hours and was kind of tiring. The snowstorms around Chicago meant the train was over four hours late before it even reached Glenwood Springs. This was a little annoying but it did give me time to get something decent to eat before boarding. Then we set off into the night with the mournful sound of the train whistle echoing through the valley.</p> <p>The Amtrak trains are pretty spacious and the seats recline so you can put your feet up.

The journey here took 26 hours and was kind of tiring. The snowstorms around Chicago meant the train was over four hours late before it even reached Glenwood Springs. This was a little annoying but it did give me time to get something decent to eat before boarding. Then we set off into the night with the mournful sound of the train whistle echoing through the valley. The Amtrak trains are pretty spacious and the seats recline so you can put your feet up. It was quite crowded but most people were up in the lounge car watching a film. In the hushed, semi-darkness of the seating car, I wrapped my coat around me, put on my headphones and quickly drifted off to sleep.

According to early figures, 12.2m people watched the final moments of the three-hour epic, though it averaged 9.9m, making it only the sixth most popular programme of the day. A Christmas special of the comedy the Royle Family only just squeezed into the top 10. The ITV soap Coronation Street, in its 40th year, was again the favourite programme with 13.7m viewers. ITV claimed victory for the second year running in the battle for peak-time viewers. Its average audience share between 6pm and 10.30pm was 40.2 % or 9.8m viewers. BBC1 attracted an average of 39.8% or 9.6m viewers. However, BBC1 did maintain its larger share of the audience throughout the day - 36.5% as against 33.7% for ITV. The satellite and cable channels increased their audience share from 10.5% last year to 15%. The number of people who watched the 3pm broadcast of the Queen's speech fell from 10.5m last year to 9.8m. Five years ago the combined total was 13.9m. Last year was the first time in 15 years that ITV had beaten BBC1 on Christmas night, prompting the BBC to invest millions in Titanic.

      "byline": "Derek Brown",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The curtain is set to rise on an extraordinary Middle East drama. Tomorrow's summit in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh will mark the effective closure of the regional peace process which began seven years ago. Whether it ends in triumph or despair is entirely open to question.</p> <p>The new summit is President Bill Clinton's last lunge for the prize he always lusted after: a final political settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.</p> <p>He has tabled a remarkable set of proposals which involve cruelly painful concessions from both sides. Israel would have to give up sovereignty over the holy site in Jerusalem known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as al-Haram as-Sharif, the Noble Sanctuary. Israel would also give up some 95% of its 1967 conquests on the West Bank, and evacuate tens of thousands of Jewish settlers.</p> <p>The Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat also has an enormous bullet to bite. The Americans are calling on him to give up the sacred cow of \"right of return\" for the 4m-odd Palestinian refugees scattered throughout the Middle East.</p> <p>The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, says he will initial the so-called bridging proposals - if Arafat does so. Palestinian officials are more cautious, saying that they need more details before they can consider the putative deal.</p> <p>Both leaders are facing the most momentous day of their political lives. Both are certain to be condemned and vilified by their own people if they accept the US plan. Yet if there is no deal in Egypt this week, the whole peace process could slither into terminal decay.</p> <p>There has never been a better or a worse time for a dash for peace. On the plus side, President Clinton is hurling all his diplomatic resources and the prestige of his office into the effort. Barak, too, is staking all on the summit. He needs a peace deal desperately if he is to cling to power in February's prime ministerial elections.</p> <p>On the minus side, the negotiation is being held against the bloody backdrop of the latest Palestinian uprising, which has claimed some 360 lives in three months. Nerves and emotions have been scraped raw, and on both sides there are militant calls for revenge and resistance.</p> <p>Ariel Sharon, leader of the rightwing Likud faction in Israel and the man who hopes to take Barak's job in February, says that if he wins he will not honour any agreement achieved at Sharm el-Sheikh. That pledge could backfire on the old warrior, as it confirms him as a fundamentalist obstacle to the peace for which most Israelis hunger.</p> <p>On the Palestinian side too there are diehards, both Islamist and secular, who are scandalised by the very idea of coming to terms with the Zionist enemy.</p> <p>For Israelis, the most shocking aspect of the US proposal is the cession of sovereignty over what they call the Temple Mount, the most sacred site in Judaism. The rocky hill is thought to be the site of the First and Second Temples. Only one small fragment of the latter remains: the Western, or Wailing, Wall.</p> <p>The US idea is apparently that Israel will retain full control of the Western Wall, and of the notoriously sensitive archaeological sites under the Mount, while the Palestinians take control of the hill's surface, on which stand the Dome of the Rock and the al-Aqsa mosque.</p> <p>But Palestinian spokesmen have demurred, saying they must have control of the whole Haram as-Sharif, including its archeological sites.</p> <p>This may seem an arcane dispute, but the conflict in the Holy Land has always involved raw and irrational emotion. Jews who believe in Eretz Israel - the Land of Israel which, in the eyes of the more dedicated believers, will one day stretch from the Mediterranean to the Euphrates - will be outraged that an Israeli government is prepared to remove Jewish settlers from the West Bank.</p> <p>That outrage is echoed among Palestinian refugees who were displaced by the wars of 1948 and 1967. They, their descendants and their many sympathisers, have for more than half a century insisted that the Zionist state must reverse its ethnic cleansing, and allow the right of return.</p> <p>Such a concession would not just convulse Israel, but obliterate it. In a population of 6m, at least 1m are Arabs, and with Jewish immigration static, the non-Jewish proportion is inexorably rising. The most that Israel is prepared to offer is a right of return to the embryonic Palestinian state of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with a tiny symbolic trickle of returnees into Israel itself, on compassionate grounds.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.israel.org/gov\" target=\"_new\">Government of Israel</a><br><a href=\"http://www.jpost.com\" target=\"_new\">Jerusalem Post</a><br><a href=\"http://www.haaretzdaily.com\" target=\"_new\">Ha'aretz</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.jrep.com\" target=\"_new\">Jerusalem Report</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.pna.net\" target=\"_new\">Palestinian National Authority</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.pna.org/mininfo\" target=\"_new\">Palestinian ministry of information</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/we.html\" target=\"_new\">CIA factbook on the West Bank</a><br><a href=\"http://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/gz.html\" target=\"_new\">CIA factbook on the Gaza Strip</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "The curtain is set to rise on an extraordinary Middle East drama. Tomorrow's summit in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh will mark the effective closure of the regional peace process which began seven years ago. Whether it ends in triumph or despair is entirely open to question. The new summit is President Bill Clinton's last lunge for the prize he always lusted after: a final political settlement between Israel and the Palestinians. He has tabled a remarkable set of proposals which involve cruelly painful concessions from both sides. Israel would have to give up sovereignty over the holy site in Jerusalem known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as al-Haram as-Sharif, the Noble Sanctuary. Israel would also give up some 95% of its 1967 conquests on the West Bank, and evacuate tens of thousands of Jewish settlers. The Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat also has an enormous bullet to bite. The Americans are calling on him to give up the sacred cow of \"right of return\" for the 4m-odd Palestinian refugees scattered throughout the Middle East. The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, says he will initial the so-called bridging proposals - if Arafat does so. Palestinian officials are more cautious, saying that they need more details before they can consider the putative deal. Both leaders are facing the most momentous day of their political lives. Both are certain to be condemned and vilified by their own people if they accept the US plan. Yet if there is no deal in Egypt this week, the whole peace process could slither into terminal decay. There has never been a better or a worse time for a dash for peace. On the plus side, President Clinton is hurling all his diplomatic resources and the prestige of his office into the effort. Barak, too, is staking all on the summit. He needs a peace deal desperately if he is to cling to power in February's prime ministerial elections. On the minus side, the negotiation is being held against the bloody backdrop of the latest Palestinian uprising, which has claimed some 360 lives in three months. Nerves and emotions have been scraped raw, and on both sides there are militant calls for revenge and resistance. Ariel Sharon, leader of the rightwing Likud faction in Israel and the man who hopes to take Barak's job in February, says that if he wins he will not honour any agreement achieved at Sharm el-Sheikh. That pledge could backfire on the old warrior, as it confirms him as a fundamentalist obstacle to the peace for which most Israelis hunger. On the Palestinian side too there are diehards, both Islamist and secular, who are scandalised by the very idea of coming to terms with the Zionist enemy. For Israelis, the most shocking aspect of the US proposal is the cession of sovereignty over what they call the Temple Mount, the most sacred site in Judaism. The rocky hill is thought to be the site of the First and Second Temples. Only one small fragment of the latter remains: the Western, or Wailing, Wall. The US idea is apparently that Israel will retain full control of the Western Wall, and of the notoriously sensitive archaeological sites under the Mount, while the Palestinians take control of the hill's surface, on which stand the Dome of the Rock and the al-Aqsa mosque. But Palestinian spokesmen have demurred, saying they must have control of the whole Haram as-Sharif, including its archeological sites. This may seem an arcane dispute, but the conflict in the Holy Land has always involved raw and irrational emotion. Jews who believe in Eretz Israel - the Land of Israel which, in the eyes of the more dedicated believers, will one day stretch from the Mediterranean to the Euphrates - will be outraged that an Israeli government is prepared to remove Jewish settlers from the West Bank. That outrage is echoed among Palestinian refugees who were displaced by the wars of 1948 and 1967. They, their descendants and their many sympathisers, have for more than half a century insisted that the Zionist state must reverse its ethnic cleansing, and allow the right of return. Such a concession would not just convulse Israel, but obliterate it. In a population of 6m, at least 1m are Arabs, and with Jewish immigration static, the non-Jewish proportion is inexorably rising. The most that Israel is prepared to offer is a right of return to the embryonic Palestinian state of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with a tiny symbolic trickle of returnees into Israel itself, on compassionate grounds.

But the grant will promote outreach to partner organisations around the capital, thus reducing access and mobility problems.</p> <p>The windfall came almost by chance. \"Details of SRB sixth round funding found their way into the office,\" said Gill Astarita, AFBP's development director. \"We realised we could actually use this to start something innovative around overcoming access difficulties.\"</p> <p>With just weeks to the June deadline for the bid's submission, a working group frantically got to grips with the SRB criteria, framing how their proposal would tackle economic disadvantage and social exclusion. But AFBP is grateful to officials at the government office of the London region who offered some clues about how a bid should set out. \"They showed us where the goal posts were,\" said Ms Astarita.</p> <p>Development should start in the spring, and plans to recruit three new trainers and a job search coordinator are well under way. Mike Webster, employment and training manager for London, is making appeals for new partners. The group is aiming for around 25 - about five in each of London's five learning and skills council areas. </p> <p>Partners will supply premises and administrative support, while AFBP will deliver training and the ICT equipment. The aim is for around 500 people to access training over the three years and for at least 50 jobs to be created. Others may become self-employed. Even where training is not followed with employment, computer training will still tackle social exclusion - a key aim of the SRB funding. </p> <p>AFBP runs training centres in three other locations in England and would like to expand. </p> <p>Roughly three-quarters of blind and partially sighted people are unemployed. African and African-Caribbean groups in particular face a double disadvantage because of their ethnic minority status. There is also a greater danger of visual impairment through higher incidence of diabetes and sickle cell anaemia in these groups.</p> <p>Ibukun Olashore, director of one the new partner groups, the Southwark-based Organisation of Blind African Caribbeans (OBAC), welcomed the opportunity to \"train trainers\". While there were plenty of knowledgeable IT workers, she said, many were not familiar with access issues for blind and visually impaired people. The partnership represented the chance to take ICT training to a much higher level than OBAC had been able to provide up to now. \"The technology is moving so fast and it is very easy to be out of date,\" she added.</p> <p>Ms Olashore also highlights the lack of motivation and confidence experienced by those who have lost their sight. Jagdish Tank, now in his 40s, came to live in Britain after sight loss four years ago, ending his involvement with the family firm in Kenya. He has been learning braille and typing with the Haringey Phoenix Group, which offers support and training to the blind and visually impaired.</p> <p>\"Losing my sight was a huge trauma,\" he said. \"It took me quite a while before I could come back to life. I thought I would never get on my feet. I hope that with good IT skills I will be able to get into business or employment.\"</p> <p>Tom Stapleton, the group's manager, said he was \"very excited\" at the prospect of the partnership with AFBP. \"We have a number of young people of working age who are anxious to get back into employment,\" he said. \"They are not trained and have no skills - this is where the scheme is going to make a difference.\"</p>",

The windfall came almost by chance. \"Details of SRB sixth round funding found their way into the office,\" said Gill Astarita, AFBP's development director. \"We realised we could actually use this to start something innovative around overcoming access difficulties.\" With just weeks to the June deadline for the bid's submission, a working group frantically got to grips with the SRB criteria, framing how their proposal would tackle economic disadvantage and social exclusion. But AFBP is grateful to officials at the government office of the London region who offered some clues about how a bid should set out. \"They showed us where the goal posts were,\" said Ms Astarita. Development should start in the spring, and plans to recruit three new trainers and a job search coordinator are well under way. Mike Webster, employment and training manager for London, is making appeals for new partners. The group is aiming for around 25 - about five in each of London's five learning and skills council areas. Partners will supply premises and administrative support, while AFBP will deliver training and the ICT equipment. The aim is for around 500 people to access training over the three years and for at least 50 jobs to be created. Others may become self-employed. Even where training is not followed with employment, computer training will still tackle social exclusion - a key aim of the SRB funding. AFBP runs training centres in three other locations in England and would like to expand. Roughly three-quarters of blind and partially sighted people are unemployed. African and African-Caribbean groups in particular face a double disadvantage because of their ethnic minority status. There is also a greater danger of visual impairment through higher incidence of diabetes and sickle cell anaemia in these groups. Ibukun Olashore, director of one the new partner groups, the Southwark-based Organisation of Blind African Caribbeans (OBAC), welcomed the opportunity to \"train trainers\". While there were plenty of knowledgeable IT workers, she said, many were not familiar with access issues for blind and visually impaired people. The partnership represented the chance to take ICT training to a much higher level than OBAC had been able to provide up to now. \"The technology is moving so fast and it is very easy to be out of date,\" she added. Ms Olashore also highlights the lack of motivation and confidence experienced by those who have lost their sight. Jagdish Tank, now in his 40s, came to live in Britain after sight loss four years ago, ending his involvement with the family firm in Kenya. He has been learning braille and typing with the Haringey Phoenix Group, which offers support and training to the blind and visually impaired. \"Losing my sight was a huge trauma,\" he said. \"It took me quite a while before I could come back to life. I thought I would never get on my feet. I hope that with good IT skills I will be able to get into business or employment.\" Tom Stapleton, the group's manager, said he was \"very excited\" at the prospect of the partnership with AFBP. \"We have a number of young people of working age who are anxious to get back into employment,\" he said. \"They are not trained and have no skills - this is where the scheme is going to make a difference.\"",

      "bodyText": "A fire in a department store in central China on Christmas Day killed at least 309 people, most of them Christmas revellers trapped in a crowded disco on the building's fourth floor, officials said yesterday. The fire, in the centre of the Luoyang, began during the evening in the basement of the Dongdu Commercial building, which was being renovated at the time. It quickly engulfed the entire four-storey structure in smoke and flames, an official in the city government's information office said. Most of the victims suffocated. The casualties included dancers and building workers involved in the renovations. In addition to the 309 dead, seven were injured and sent to local hospitals, the official Xinhua news agency reported. At least 200 people were in the fourth-floor disco and construction workers were on the second and third floors when the fire started. The disco was privately run, and illegal, officials said. State media reported that 60 people escaped from the building during the fire. Henan television showed flames shooting out of smashed windows on the building's first floor. Firefighters sprayed the glass front of the building, which remained largely intact. One woman was shown hanging out of a window waiting to be rescued. Firefighters plucked some people, children among them, from the upper floors using a platform mounted on a crane. Shortly after the fire broke out at around 9.30pm, the dance hall erupted in chaos, the Henan Daily, the provincial government's newspaper, reported. Firefighters tried to enter the disco but retreated before the thick smoke, unable to discover how many people were inside. One partygoer, a Mrs Wang - her face black with soot, her hands bloody - said she and five or six others jumped to safety from a balcony. She did not know if her husband had escaped. An employee at a cinema across the street said smoke poured from the top and back of the building. She said that firefighters and police officers were searching the building yesterday, keeping the area cordoned off. About 750 police and firefighters rushed to the scene and put out the fire within three hours, the Luoyang Evening News said. The disco was crowded with people attending a Christmas party, according to local media and officials. Although Christmas is not a holiday in officially atheistic China, it has become a fashionable occasion for parties among the younger urban Chinese. Henan provincial television said the construction work might have been to blame for the fire, but a government official said only that the cause was under investigation. Construction materials may have blocked escape routes, contributing to the disaster, and vendors' stalls around the building also hampered rescue efforts. Twenty years of rapid economic growth has left China with spotty safety regulations and lax enforcement, and fires and building collapses are common. Henan - China's most populous province - came under criticism in March when 74 people died in a fire in a cinema in Jiaozuo city. Monday's fire, however, may be China's worst in six years. On December 8 1994, a fire killed 385 people - most of them children - at a theatre in the far western region of Xinjiang. Only one exit door was unlocked when the fire occurred. In a sign of official concern, Beijing sent a vice-minister, Shi Wanpeng, to Luoyang yesterday to assess the disaster and the local government's response. The fire occurred just before the Lunar New Year, China's biggest holiday, which this year falls on January 24: a time when Chinese leaders routinely order greater vigilance against accidents. A public security ministery directive yesterday ordered checks on public buildings. AP",

      "trailText": "<p>After 60 years of being biffed, whacked and chased round the house, Tom and Jerry are crashing into the 21st century with Mansion Cat.  Duncan Campbell  talks to the man behind the mayhem, Joe Barbera</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>So what was the Pope saying to you? \"He was asking me if he could become a director,\" says Joe Barbera, looking at the framed photograph of himself greeting the head of the Roman Catholic church, which occupies pride of place amid the Oscars, Emmys and honorary fire- chief helmets that adorn his 14th floor office in Sherman Oaks. \"He was a Hollywood fan, I can tell you that.\" </p> <p>Alas for the fans of biblical epics and costume dramas, the Pope never made it to Hollywood. Barbera did. And he didn't just make it to Hollywood, he made it in Hollywood. The boy who started his artistic life copying pictures from the Bible, at the Holy Innocents school in Brooklyn more than 80 years ago, went on to become half of one of the most celebrated partnerships in film history. Working with William Hanna, he created an extraordinary menagerie of animated characters including Tom and Jerry, the Flintstones, Top Cat, Yogi Bear, Huckleberry Hound and Quick Draw MacGraw. He has won seven Oscars, eight Emmys and a total of 247 awards around the world. Now, 30 years after the last Tom and Jerry movie, there is to be a new one: Mansion Cat, for which Barbera is acting as consultant and doing one of the voices. </p> <p>\"One nun, Sister Mary Nicholas, she would belt you on the back of the head,\" says Barbera of his days at the Holy Innocents. He talks in a low Brooklyn growl, with the timing of a stand-up comic. \"And my grand mother - she had the fastest hands in the west.\" He demonstrates how she would deliver a speedy clip to any child that stepped out of line. Whack! Biff! Maybe this is where all those whacks and biffs that characterise Tom and Jerry started. </p> <p>Barbera will be 90 in March, but he is looking natty and groomed in a black polo shirt, herring-bone tweed jacket and flannels. \"You're looking very dashing,\" says Catherine, who handles publicity for him at Warner Brothers. \"What do you want?\" he asks with a louche grin. He comes to work every day, driven in his Mercedes by his assistant, Carlton. </p> <p>Half a dozen of his projects are in storyboard form in his room. He starts running through one of the plots, complete with action, when he suddenly stops and says sotto voce to Catherine in a Groucho-like aside: \"He looks like a Disney spy to me.\" </p> <p>Walt Disney, of course, looms large over any discussion about the history of animation. Barbera was nearly hired by him when he was a young hopeful cartoonist in New York. He had just seen Disney's Skeleton Dance: \"I wrote my first and last fan letter to Walt Disney studios in California and I got an answer right away from Walt Disney himself. He said he was coming to New York and he would call me. The luckiest break I ever had was that he never called. I would have gone over there and disappeared.\" </p> <p>They only met once, at a barbecue, and he remembers Disney mainly for his secretive nature and enjoyment of bourbon: \"We admired him, but we were way ahead of him in humour.\" </p> <p>He explains how his family came from Sicily - \"It's not just the Mafia, Sicily has some of the best food, the best architecture\" - and how he was born in Delancey Street in the heart of New York's Italian quarter on the Lower East Side. His father was a hairdresser who liked to bet on the horses at the Belmont race track. </p> <p>The young Joe embarked on a career in a bank. He detested the work and studied art at night at the Pratt institute. His first animation work was on Popeye, as an inker. \"I was there three days and I asked one of the other inkers how long he had been doing the job. He said 'three years,' so I quit.\" After a spell at the Van Beuren cartoon studio he worked for Terrytoons in New Rochelle and was then hired by the new MGM Cartoon arm in Los Angeles. </p> <p>It was there, in 1937, that he met Hanna, another young animator who had moved with his family as boy from New Mexico to Watts in LA. Sixty years on, they are still friends and collaborators, although Hanna's visits to the studio are less frequent. Those were heady days in the cartoon world. Some Disney animators rebelled against their boss in 1941, went on strike and were sacked. They founded their own studio, United Productions of America, choosing a different, freer style of cartooning than Disney's and producing such characters as Mr Magoo, Howdy Doody and Gerald McBoing Boing. </p> <p>Barbera and Hanna meanwhile ploughed their own furrow, working for MGM at a Stakhanovite pace. In 1940 they had produced their first Tom and Jerry cartoon, Puss Gets The Boot, and despite some reservations about the characters from their producer, Fred Quimby - \"what can you do with a cat and mouse that would be different?\" - two stars had been born. </p> <p>In 1943, Yankee Doodle Mouse won an Oscar and another followed for Mouse Trouble in 1944, for Quiet Please in 1945 and so on through the 40s and early 50s. Every year the game was to try to beat Disney to the award. \"It's pretty much the same now,\" Barbera says. \"The only difference is that the women wear less clothes.\" </p> <p>He is not impressed by new cartoon techniques. He and Hanna had experimented with live action using Tom and Jerry in a dance sequence with Gene Kelly in Anchors Aweigh as long ago as 1945 and having them join Esther Williams for an underwater ballet sequence in Dangerous When Wet in 1953. After Quimby's retirement in1955, Hanna and Barbera became the production heads for cartooning at MGM. It was the time of the blacklist in Hollywood, but Barbera says he was not touched by it: \"It was only the live action writers that were affected. I didn't have any dialogue in my films - I was influenced by Charlie Chaplin, the most brilliant of all.\" </p> <p>In 1957, MGM decided to close their cartoon division: the golden era of film cartoons had ended with the arrival of television - \"the monster\", Barbera calls it. The two friends took Tom and Jerry and formed Hanna-Barbera; they tossed up for whose name should come first. Their first new characters were Rough and Reddy and the prodigious output continued as they accommodated the new television market with the Flintstones, Huckleberry Hound and Top Cat. </p> <p>In 1975 they revived Tom and Jerry with Grape Ape, a gigantic purple ape. It was clear that the cat and mouse were now less violent. Was this because of public pressure? Barbera says the same argument about violence in films being a bad influence was going on 50 years ago. \"Tom and Jerry were never going to kill each other, they were friends. Tom did it to Jerry and Jerry did it to Tom.\" </p> <p>Although they survived through the 80s, outside the studios the animation world was changing. In 1991 Ted Turner bought Hanna-Barbera and when Turner merged with Time Warner, Hanna-Barbera became part of the deal. They had to leave their beautiful old studio building to move to the anonymous space in Sherman Oaks. Barbera is a traditionalist and regrets the passing of a more sociable time. </p> <p>\"In those days, our cartoon studio was like a club, people worked there for 25 years,\" he says. \"Now when you finish a job they let you go ... There are too many conferences nowadays, six people trying to settle on an idea.\" </p> <p>So what does he think of other cartoon styles? The Simpsons, where Itchy and Scratchy are a form of homage to Tom and Jerry? \"I already did that (the family) with the Flintstones but their material is good. I salute them.\" South Park? \"It seems that everyone who doesn't know how to draw has a TV series.\" He does not think much of the east European cartoon tradition - \"there's no warmth\" - or the Japanese school - \"the violence is unbelievable\". </p> <p>He is married to an Englishwoman - \"from Mitcham, does that sound right?\" - and has been to lunch once with the Duke of Westminster. \"He has his own airfield, you know.\" He met the Duke's children, \"the little princes\" as he calls them and was flattered to discover that the Duke's dog was named Scooby Doo.

      "bodyText": "So what was the Pope saying to you? \"He was asking me if he could become a director,\" says Joe Barbera, looking at the framed photograph of himself greeting the head of the Roman Catholic church, which occupies pride of place amid the Oscars, Emmys and honorary fire- chief helmets that adorn his 14th floor office in Sherman Oaks. \"He was a Hollywood fan, I can tell you that.\" Alas for the fans of biblical epics and costume dramas, the Pope never made it to Hollywood. Barbera did. And he didn't just make it to Hollywood, he made it in Hollywood. The boy who started his artistic life copying pictures from the Bible, at the Holy Innocents school in Brooklyn more than 80 years ago, went on to become half of one of the most celebrated partnerships in film history. Working with William Hanna, he created an extraordinary menagerie of animated characters including Tom and Jerry, the Flintstones, Top Cat, Yogi Bear, Huckleberry Hound and Quick Draw MacGraw. He has won seven Oscars, eight Emmys and a total of 247 awards around the world. Now, 30 years after the last Tom and Jerry movie, there is to be a new one: Mansion Cat, for which Barbera is acting as consultant and doing one of the voices. \"One nun, Sister Mary Nicholas, she would belt you on the back of the head,\" says Barbera of his days at the Holy Innocents. He talks in a low Brooklyn growl, with the timing of a stand-up comic. \"And my grand mother - she had the fastest hands in the west.\" He demonstrates how she would deliver a speedy clip to any child that stepped out of line. Whack! Biff! Maybe this is where all those whacks and biffs that characterise Tom and Jerry started. Barbera will be 90 in March, but he is looking natty and groomed in a black polo shirt, herring-bone tweed jacket and flannels. \"You're looking very dashing,\" says Catherine, who handles publicity for him at Warner Brothers. \"What do you want?\" he asks with a louche grin. He comes to work every day, driven in his Mercedes by his assistant, Carlton. Half a dozen of his projects are in storyboard form in his room. He starts running through one of the plots, complete with action, when he suddenly stops and says sotto voce to Catherine in a Groucho-like aside: \"He looks like a Disney spy to me.\" Walt Disney, of course, looms large over any discussion about the history of animation. Barbera was nearly hired by him when he was a young hopeful cartoonist in New York. He had just seen Disney's Skeleton Dance: \"I wrote my first and last fan letter to Walt Disney studios in California and I got an answer right away from Walt Disney himself. He said he was coming to New York and he would call me. The luckiest break I ever had was that he never called. I would have gone over there and disappeared.\" They only met once, at a barbecue, and he remembers Disney mainly for his secretive nature and enjoyment of bourbon: \"We admired him, but we were way ahead of him in humour.\" He explains how his family came from Sicily - \"It's not just the Mafia, Sicily has some of the best food, the best architecture\" - and how he was born in Delancey Street in the heart of New York's Italian quarter on the Lower East Side. His father was a hairdresser who liked to bet on the horses at the Belmont race track. The young Joe embarked on a career in a bank. He detested the work and studied art at night at the Pratt institute. His first animation work was on Popeye, as an inker. \"I was there three days and I asked one of the other inkers how long he had been doing the job. He said 'three years,' so I quit.\" After a spell at the Van Beuren cartoon studio he worked for Terrytoons in New Rochelle and was then hired by the new MGM Cartoon arm in Los Angeles. It was there, in 1937, that he met Hanna, another young animator who had moved with his family as boy from New Mexico to Watts in LA. Sixty years on, they are still friends and collaborators, although Hanna's visits to the studio are less frequent. Those were heady days in the cartoon world. Some Disney animators rebelled against their boss in 1941, went on strike and were sacked. They founded their own studio, United Productions of America, choosing a different, freer style of cartooning than Disney's and producing such characters as Mr Magoo, Howdy Doody and Gerald McBoing Boing. Barbera and Hanna meanwhile ploughed their own furrow, working for MGM at a Stakhanovite pace. In 1940 they had produced their first Tom and Jerry cartoon, Puss Gets The Boot, and despite some reservations about the characters from their producer, Fred Quimby - \"what can you do with a cat and mouse that would be different?\" - two stars had been born. In 1943, Yankee Doodle Mouse won an Oscar and another followed for Mouse Trouble in 1944, for Quiet Please in 1945 and so on through the 40s and early 50s. Every year the game was to try to beat Disney to the award. \"It's pretty much the same now,\" Barbera says. \"The only difference is that the women wear less clothes.\" He is not impressed by new cartoon techniques. He and Hanna had experimented with live action using Tom and Jerry in a dance sequence with Gene Kelly in Anchors Aweigh as long ago as 1945 and having them join Esther Williams for an underwater ballet sequence in Dangerous When Wet in 1953. After Quimby's retirement in1955, Hanna and Barbera became the production heads for cartooning at MGM. It was the time of the blacklist in Hollywood, but Barbera says he was not touched by it: \"It was only the live action writers that were affected. I didn't have any dialogue in my films - I was influenced by Charlie Chaplin, the most brilliant of all.\" In 1957, MGM decided to close their cartoon division: the golden era of film cartoons had ended with the arrival of television - \"the monster\", Barbera calls it. The two friends took Tom and Jerry and formed Hanna-Barbera; they tossed up for whose name should come first. Their first new characters were Rough and Reddy and the prodigious output continued as they accommodated the new television market with the Flintstones, Huckleberry Hound and Top Cat. In 1975 they revived Tom and Jerry with Grape Ape, a gigantic purple ape. It was clear that the cat and mouse were now less violent. Was this because of public pressure? Barbera says the same argument about violence in films being a bad influence was going on 50 years ago. \"Tom and Jerry were never going to kill each other, they were friends. Tom did it to Jerry and Jerry did it to Tom.\" Although they survived through the 80s, outside the studios the animation world was changing. In 1991 Ted Turner bought Hanna-Barbera and when Turner merged with Time Warner, Hanna-Barbera became part of the deal. They had to leave their beautiful old studio building to move to the anonymous space in Sherman Oaks. Barbera is a traditionalist and regrets the passing of a more sociable time. \"In those days, our cartoon studio was like a club, people worked there for 25 years,\" he says. \"Now when you finish a job they let you go ... There are too many conferences nowadays, six people trying to settle on an idea.\" So what does he think of other cartoon styles? The Simpsons, where Itchy and Scratchy are a form of homage to Tom and Jerry? \"I already did that (the family) with the Flintstones but their material is good. I salute them.\" South Park? \"It seems that everyone who doesn't know how to draw has a TV series.\" He does not think much of the east European cartoon tradition - \"there's no warmth\" - or the Japanese school - \"the violence is unbelievable\". He is married to an Englishwoman - \"from Mitcham, does that sound right?\" - and has been to lunch once with the Duke of Westminster. \"He has his own airfield, you know.\" He met the Duke's children, \"the little princes\" as he calls them and was flattered to discover that the Duke's dog was named Scooby Doo. He would cross the Atlantic by Concorde. One occupational hazard was that the pilots would always ask him to draw a cartoon for them: \"Thank God I quit flying.\" He has a home in Studio City where the previous night he had been taking part in a karaoke evening, doing a bit of Dean Martin. There's also a villa in Palm Springs, complete with pool and tennis court. But he says he will keep coming in to work until he drops. \"I don't know that I love to work but I love to have new ideas.\" He tells how Sun Microsoft had invited him to talk to their salespeople and explain how he came up with the idea of the Jetsons and the world of the future. \"I told them 1,000 years from now or a million years, the problem is always going to be parking.\" He had also come up with the idea of the treadmill, now an integral part of the LA home, 35 years ago, he says.

      "body": "<p>When I was in Delhi, recently, I was invited to dinner at the home of General Chhachhi. He is a tall Sikh gentleman, who began his career fighting for the British in Burma, fought in all India's wars, won many medals for bravery, and ended up with six stars. The other guests, all from Pakistan, included two more retired generals, the head of a medical institute, a leading newspaper columnist, two trades union organisers, and a number of a key figures from the women's movement. They had come to India to attend an anti-nuclear convention and were being entertained by their fellow Indian peace activist, General Chhachhi.</p> <p>The nuclear tests that were carried out in India in May 1998, closely followed by Pakistani tests, are widely assumed to have been popular. CNN showed pictures of jubilant Indians and Pakistanis, looking much as though they were celebrating a victory in a Test match. The tests seemed to mark the final demise of secular, humane India, the India of Gandhi and Nehru, of non-violence and tolerance. It was the coming to power of the Hindu nationalist party, the BJP, that led to the tests although the institutional momentum of the Indian Atomic Energy Commission was also an important factor.</p> <p>Someone at the party said that the RSS, the rightwing movement close to the BJP, had killed Gandhi twice - once in 1948 and once 50 years later - with the tests.</p> <p>But the BJP triumph was shortlived. Anti-nuclear groups sprang up all over India, much as in Europe in the early 80s. Opinion polls show that more than 70% of the population is opposed to the development of nuclear weapons and the popularity of the BJP has not increased.</p> <p>Last year, there was a march from Pokharan, the test site, to Sarnath near Varanasi where Buddha lived and preached, to coincide with the first anniversary of the test, which had taken place on Buddha's birthday.

      "bodyText": "When I was in Delhi, recently, I was invited to dinner at the home of General Chhachhi. He is a tall Sikh gentleman, who began his career fighting for the British in Burma, fought in all India's wars, won many medals for bravery, and ended up with six stars. The other guests, all from Pakistan, included two more retired generals, the head of a medical institute, a leading newspaper columnist, two trades union organisers, and a number of a key figures from the women's movement. They had come to India to attend an anti-nuclear convention and were being entertained by their fellow Indian peace activist, General Chhachhi. The nuclear tests that were carried out in India in May 1998, closely followed by Pakistani tests, are widely assumed to have been popular. CNN showed pictures of jubilant Indians and Pakistanis, looking much as though they were celebrating a victory in a Test match. The tests seemed to mark the final demise of secular, humane India, the India of Gandhi and Nehru, of non-violence and tolerance. It was the coming to power of the Hindu nationalist party, the BJP, that led to the tests although the institutional momentum of the Indian Atomic Energy Commission was also an important factor. Someone at the party said that the RSS, the rightwing movement close to the BJP, had killed Gandhi twice - once in 1948 and once 50 years later - with the tests. But the BJP triumph was shortlived. Anti-nuclear groups sprang up all over India, much as in Europe in the early 80s. Opinion polls show that more than 70% of the population is opposed to the development of nuclear weapons and the popularity of the BJP has not increased. Last year, there was a march from Pokharan, the test site, to Sarnath near Varanasi where Buddha lived and preached, to coincide with the first anniversary of the test, which had taken place on Buddha's birthday. Some 30-40,000 people took part, including 80-year-old Gandhians, veterans of the independence movement. Some 600 people came to the anti-nuclear convention last month from all parts of India, as well as delegations from Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.

      "body": "<p>Earth in 2000 - it seemed - had nothing to show that was more fair. It was London's year. Heritage had always been good for local trade, but now there was a dramatic edge of elegant modernity to gratify the locals and attract the visitors. Suddenly this was a renaissance city, an affair of courtyards and galleries, of walkways, avenues and towers which revealed new vistas and perspectives to feed the mind and delight the spirit. Forgotten buildings were reborn and new ones rose from the ground. London had made it new and the shock of the modern had arrived by the banks of the Thames. </p> <p>Londoners still had to contest with the tube, of course, as their daily via dolorosa. But however battered by infrastructure, they knew as they looked above ground that they were privileged to be part of a phenomenon. 2000 was one of those years in urban history when one city held the world's attention. Even the one failure - the Dome - was so monstrous that it could only have happened in the city which was the one and only place to be. </p> <p>The scale of the success dazzled but also bewildered - so out of pro portion, it seemed, with what went on anywhere else in Britain. It was all heady stuff, and London was certainly good for London. But was it good for Britain as a whole? </p> <p>London now stretches from Chelmsford in the east to Reading in the west, from St Albans in the north to Crawley in the south. Oxford and Brighton, Colchester and Milton Keynes are its suburbs. All who live within this area are Londoners. They earn more money, exercise sharper wits, lead faster lives and live in more expensive houses than their fellow Britons. Go beyond this domain and you're out of it. What you may gain in manners you will lose in edge and pace. The differences between Londoners and the English are now as great as those between the British and the Italians. This is not a city. It is a nation. </p> <p>London works harder and longer than England. But the work ethic which is its tribute to residual protestantism is twin to its hedonism. London always did drink more than England - first gin, then beer and now wine. It also swears more, with that violently exhaled \"fuck\", the product of the extra aspirant peculiar to the word's London pronunciation. </p> <p>Provincial laments about London recur in English history. The \"great wen\" was thought to be a spectacularly sinful consumer of goods and gratifier of appetites. But its most important consumption has always been that of people, whom it draws within its maw and turns to its own use. Hence the lament of the London-Welsh preacher that Paddington station was the most sacred spot on earth because it was where the Welsh deposited their souls on arrival. It has always been seen as a foreign place - and one that is out of synch with the English nation's temper, whose most tempting self-image is one of rural withdrawal and gentrified order. </p> <p>Once there were towns medium and large that mediated between these two extremes of Arcady and Babylon. But their importance in politics and culture has died. The county towns are now just a part of the English countryside. Leeds and Sheffield, Birmingham and Newcastle contribute little to the outside world's view of what England is and does. </p> <p>Middlemarch is the last great English provincial novel, and George Eliot is now almost as dead as Queen Anne. Arnold Bennett is remembered - if at all - as an omelette invented at the Savoy, not as the voice of the Potteries. Our literary voices are London ones. Muriel Spark's tone is never that far a cry from Kensington and Beryl Bainbridge is more Camden than Scouse. Martin Amis's characters display the Londoner's self-conscious enjoyment of low motive. Julian Barnes's are discoverable only under the auspicious constellations of SW and N. The cardiganed angst of Anita Brookner's heroines is a peculiarly north London condition. Literature enforces London nationalism. </p> <p>Like all nations, ever since Upper and Lower Egypt started the game, London has its \"north-south divide\". It has its national symbol in the Eye - a suitably pagan appropriation of Fortuna's wheel for a very secular place - and a worthy necropolis in the Dome. It has an assembly and a healthy tradition of radical rioting. But the nation is more interested in money than in politics. GLC abolition came and went while life flowed back into the boroughs, London's constituent cities of Clerkenwell and Chelsea, Islington and Lambeth. </p> <p>London is more tolerant of eccentricity, of differences of race, faith, colour and sexuality than the rest of England. But it is a tolerance which is born of indifference. We rub shoulders - and so we have to get on with things rather than introspect. </p> <p>The nation is international without being particularly outward- looking. It can afford to indulge its own form of provincialism. Here you can eat and forget that most of England remains a gastronomic dump. We're gratified to have 200,000 French citizens here - and some believe the Europhobic press, which sees them all as economic exiles from taxation rather than the jobbing waiters they more often are. </p> <p>London is the central imaginative, commercial and political fact of modern England. But London as nation is also a European disaster. </p> <p>There's no continental equivalent for the way London looms over the country in which it finds itself. \"Over-centralised\" France has always been something of a comforting Euro-sceptic myth, especially after the decentralisation of the 80s. Rhetorical emphasis on national unity - like republican injunctions of fraternity - were only necessary because the reality was so different. </p> <p>Paris's influence has been cultural and intellectual. But the lives lived in Lyons and Bordeaux, Rennes, Tours and Avignon show not only models of bourgeois civilisation which have disappeared from the English provincial town, but also a diffusion of power and influence. England, the country that united earlier and more completely than any other European one - and did so under the aegis of an imposed Protestant uniformity and a dominant capital - is a European oddity. </p> <p> In Germany, ancient forms of imperial free cities, the Freist\u00e4dte, lurk beneath modern L\u00e4nder and a myriad civic forms of autonomy bloom. In Italy, Rome is a home for the spirit and the bureaucrat, but Turin is one for intellectuals and Milan is the capital of the catwalk and of capitalism alike. Madrid was an Iberian Canberra invented by Philip II at the artificial heart of his country - but in Barcelona, Vigo and Bilbao ancient liberties are revived in the regionalised peninsular experience. </p> <p>In continental Europe the city-state tradition is alive and kicking. Sometimes that tradition has taken an imperial form (Venice) and an occasionally despotic one (Florence). But by and large it has looked back to a more ancient model, to Athens and Rome - and to republican traditions of participation which made sense because the political unit was small enough. </p> <p>England offers no parallel to these survivals from an old world renewed. Its regions are not authentic provinces. Wessex and Mercia are dreary units of diminished local government - not cultural forces that attract loyalty. Offa's memory moves no West Midlands dissidents. East Anglia is just a TV franchise and, apart from the terrible sound of Peter Pears wailing in the Aldeburgh marshes, is not a cultural experience. And London in all its national but anonymous vastness can offer no political space - only room to consume. </p> <p>London is not just bigger - and more conceited - than any other European capital. It is also immeasurably more powerful financially. The euro cannot work if the world's largest foreign exchange market stays outside. Breaking the euro will also be the breaking of Europe. But a wrecked Europe is also the ruination of London. </p> <p>Europe needs the London nation but cannot accommodate it.

      "bodyText": "Earth in 2000 - it seemed - had nothing to show that was more fair. It was London's year. Heritage had always been good for local trade, but now there was a dramatic edge of elegant modernity to gratify the locals and attract the visitors. Suddenly this was a renaissance city, an affair of courtyards and galleries, of walkways, avenues and towers which revealed new vistas and perspectives to feed the mind and delight the spirit. Forgotten buildings were reborn and new ones rose from the ground. London had made it new and the shock of the modern had arrived by the banks of the Thames. Londoners still had to contest with the tube, of course, as their daily via dolorosa. But however battered by infrastructure, they knew as they looked above ground that they were privileged to be part of a phenomenon. 2000 was one of those years in urban history when one city held the world's attention. Even the one failure - the Dome - was so monstrous that it could only have happened in the city which was the one and only place to be. The scale of the success dazzled but also bewildered - so out of pro portion, it seemed, with what went on anywhere else in Britain. It was all heady stuff, and London was certainly good for London. But was it good for Britain as a whole? London now stretches from Chelmsford in the east to Reading in the west, from St Albans in the north to Crawley in the south. Oxford and Brighton, Colchester and Milton Keynes are its suburbs. All who live within this area are Londoners. They earn more money, exercise sharper wits, lead faster lives and live in more expensive houses than their fellow Britons. Go beyond this domain and you're out of it. What you may gain in manners you will lose in edge and pace. The differences between Londoners and the English are now as great as those between the British and the Italians. This is not a city. It is a nation. London works harder and longer than England. But the work ethic which is its tribute to residual protestantism is twin to its hedonism. London always did drink more than England - first gin, then beer and now wine. It also swears more, with that violently exhaled \"fuck\", the product of the extra aspirant peculiar to the word's London pronunciation. Provincial laments about London recur in English history. The \"great wen\" was thought to be a spectacularly sinful consumer of goods and gratifier of appetites. But its most important consumption has always been that of people, whom it draws within its maw and turns to its own use. Hence the lament of the London-Welsh preacher that Paddington station was the most sacred spot on earth because it was where the Welsh deposited their souls on arrival. It has always been seen as a foreign place - and one that is out of synch with the English nation's temper, whose most tempting self-image is one of rural withdrawal and gentrified order. Once there were towns medium and large that mediated between these two extremes of Arcady and Babylon. But their importance in politics and culture has died. The county towns are now just a part of the English countryside. Leeds and Sheffield, Birmingham and Newcastle contribute little to the outside world's view of what England is and does. Middlemarch is the last great English provincial novel, and George Eliot is now almost as dead as Queen Anne. Arnold Bennett is remembered - if at all - as an omelette invented at the Savoy, not as the voice of the Potteries. Our literary voices are London ones. Muriel Spark's tone is never that far a cry from Kensington and Beryl Bainbridge is more Camden than Scouse. Martin Amis's characters display the Londoner's self-conscious enjoyment of low motive. Julian Barnes's are discoverable only under the auspicious constellations of SW and N. The cardiganed angst of Anita Brookner's heroines is a peculiarly north London condition. Literature enforces London nationalism. Like all nations, ever since Upper and Lower Egypt started the game, London has its \"north-south divide\". It has its national symbol in the Eye - a suitably pagan appropriation of Fortuna's wheel for a very secular place - and a worthy necropolis in the Dome. It has an assembly and a healthy tradition of radical rioting. But the nation is more interested in money than in politics. GLC abolition came and went while life flowed back into the boroughs, London's constituent cities of Clerkenwell and Chelsea, Islington and Lambeth. London is more tolerant of eccentricity, of differences of race, faith, colour and sexuality than the rest of England. But it is a tolerance which is born of indifference. We rub shoulders - and so we have to get on with things rather than introspect. The nation is international without being particularly outward- looking. It can afford to indulge its own form of provincialism. Here you can eat and forget that most of England remains a gastronomic dump. We're gratified to have 200,000 French citizens here - and some believe the Europhobic press, which sees them all as economic exiles from taxation rather than the jobbing waiters they more often are. London is the central imaginative, commercial and political fact of modern England. But London as nation is also a European disaster. There's no continental equivalent for the way London looms over the country in which it finds itself. \"Over-centralised\" France has always been something of a comforting Euro-sceptic myth, especially after the decentralisation of the 80s. Rhetorical emphasis on national unity - like republican injunctions of fraternity - were only necessary because the reality was so different. Paris's influence has been cultural and intellectual. But the lives lived in Lyons and Bordeaux, Rennes, Tours and Avignon show not only models of bourgeois civilisation which have disappeared from the English provincial town, but also a diffusion of power and influence. England, the country that united earlier and more completely than any other European one - and did so under the aegis of an imposed Protestant uniformity and a dominant capital - is a European oddity. In Germany, ancient forms of imperial free cities, the Freist\u00e4dte, lurk beneath modern L\u00e4nder and a myriad civic forms of autonomy bloom. In Italy, Rome is a home for the spirit and the bureaucrat, but Turin is one for intellectuals and Milan is the capital of the catwalk and of capitalism alike. Madrid was an Iberian Canberra invented by Philip II at the artificial heart of his country - but in Barcelona, Vigo and Bilbao ancient liberties are revived in the regionalised peninsular experience. In continental Europe the city-state tradition is alive and kicking. Sometimes that tradition has taken an imperial form (Venice) and an occasionally despotic one (Florence). But by and large it has looked back to a more ancient model, to Athens and Rome - and to republican traditions of participation which made sense because the political unit was small enough. England offers no parallel to these survivals from an old world renewed. Its regions are not authentic provinces. Wessex and Mercia are dreary units of diminished local government - not cultural forces that attract loyalty. Offa's memory moves no West Midlands dissidents. East Anglia is just a TV franchise and, apart from the terrible sound of Peter Pears wailing in the Aldeburgh marshes, is not a cultural experience. And London in all its national but anonymous vastness can offer no political space - only room to consume. London is not just bigger - and more conceited - than any other European capital. It is also immeasurably more powerful financially. The euro cannot work if the world's largest foreign exchange market stays outside. Breaking the euro will also be the breaking of Europe. But a wrecked Europe is also the ruination of London. Europe needs the London nation but cannot accommodate it. That nation's rootless, shiftless sense of adventure makes it an impossible partner in the imagined safety zone of \"European integration\". To the settled political-historical differences we must add London's present mood of capitalist glee and cultural pride in which it imagines itself to be an imperium receiving tribute from every subject race. The conceit is not just foolish - it has all the elements of a \"necessary\" tragic conflict: irreconcilable opposites, hubris, ignorance and collision ending in waste. Berlin, Rome, Paris and their sisters can all handle \"Europe\". London, seeing it as either a threat or an irrelevance, can't or won't. This is the only capital in Europe which sees itself as an awesomely self-sufficient power exercising a dominion of homogenised taste, central government and financial power over the benighted provinces. But in post-Maastricht Europe the English regions and cities are now offered not only money but also a constitutional model. There's the prospect of a prestige which they lost in Britain's late imperial 20th century but can regain in the Europeanised England of the 21st century. The provincial elites can confront the metropolitan elites and look beyond them to the European ones. Here lie the seeds of a major conflict of allegiances and powers: not only a regional renaissance but also a capital counter-revolution. \"Provincial\" can now mean \"European\" - not obscure. Yorkshire, Cornwall and Devon can join Rhne-Alpes, Catalonia and Lombardy in the recognition that we are all Euro-regionalists now.

The 53-year-old professional who declined to be named, said: \"This is our finest hour. If we do not get a ban now, I do not believe we ever will. Hunting isn't the cruellest thing going on. It is the tip of a huge iceberg but it is the easiest thing to get banned. It has got to go. </p> <p>\"It would be a moral victory and it would open the floodgates for further essential reform. This is crucial for animal rights. It is a war. There is no other word for it. It is not a class war, it is a moral war.\" </p> <p>Laina Cracknell, executive committee member of the League Against Cruel Sports, said she believed the bell was finally tolling for hunting and was confident that an absolute ban was the only was forward. </p> <p>But, across the road, the Countryside Alliance poured scorn on the \"excessive boasts\" of animal rights activists, dismissing any suggestion of defeat and insisting thousands of people across the UK had shown themselves committed to securing hunting's future. </p> <p>Liz Mort, spokeswoman for the pro-hunting group, said: \"We are very buoyant and optimistic and we are certainly looking forward to hunting in the next millennium. There are few protesters compared with the numbers of supporters.\" </p> <p>An hour-long standoff escalated into an emotional frenzy as the men and women of the Essex Farmers &amp; Union Foxhounds hunt approached Maldon high street. Horses and hounds appeared bewildered by the deafening noise as they were corralled between the two camps, while immaculate riders greeted supporters, smoked cigarettes and enjoyed cups of wine before the day's exertions. </p> <p>Police later confirmed that there had been one arrest after hunters and horses were pelted with missiles, including eggs, during their 15-minute appearance in Maldon. </p> <p>Protesters also targeted a meet of the Holcombe Harriers near Bolton, Greater Manchester, and a further 120 activists descended on the Spooners and West Dartmoor hunt's meet in Tavistock, Devon. At the Duke of Beaufort's estate in south Gloucestershire, police estimated there were about 1,500 hunt supporters. </p> <p>The home secretary, Jack Straw, recently offered the hunters a glimmer of hope that the government might be prepared to back down, when he came out against an outright ban, declaring his support for a compromise which would allow the option of tighter licensing of hunts. </p> <p>But the bill is certain to meet passionate opposition in the Lords where peers will be allowed to vote on three options. </p> <p>The Conservative leader, William Hague, is also under backbench pressure to give a commitment to make repealing a ban a top priority if re-elected. </p> <p>Mr Hague was warned last week by the former agriculture secretary Douglas Hogg that he would \"have to look over his shoulder\" if he did not give a clear commitment. </p> <p>He told MPs he was not speaking for himself, but some of his colleagues in saying: \"If we get back in with a majority and the bill is passed, we will do our utmost to ensure that hunting is lawful once again.\" </p> <p>The bill will reach the Lords near the end of February. Discussions have already started on the best sequence of voting to ensure that the Lords get a proper chance to support for their preferred option. It is expected the Commons will vote for an outright ban early next month. The Lords will then be given the option of voting for the ban, a licensing authority or self-regulation. </p> <p><strong> Timetable for bill</strong><br> </p> <p> The hunting bill presents three options: </p> <p><strong> A complete ban on hunting with hounds</strong> - put forward by the RSPCA, the League Against Cruel Sports and the International Fund for Animal Welfare under the umbrella group Deadline 2000 </p> <p><strong> Statutory regulation</strong> - based on the premise that hunting with dogs should be allowed to continue only on a licensed basis with an enforceable code of conduct - put forward by the cross-party middle way group </p> <p><strong> Self-regulation</strong> - put forward by the Countryside Alliance </p> <p>MPs are to vote on the three options in January </p> <p>Bill will then go into standing committee, to be completed by February 8 </p> <p>Expected to go to House of Lords by end of February</p>",

It has got to go. \"It would be a moral victory and it would open the floodgates for further essential reform. This is crucial for animal rights. It is a war. There is no other word for it. It is not a class war, it is a moral war.\" Laina Cracknell, executive committee member of the League Against Cruel Sports, said she believed the bell was finally tolling for hunting and was confident that an absolute ban was the only was forward. But, across the road, the Countryside Alliance poured scorn on the \"excessive boasts\" of animal rights activists, dismissing any suggestion of defeat and insisting thousands of people across the UK had shown themselves committed to securing hunting's future. Liz Mort, spokeswoman for the pro-hunting group, said: \"We are very buoyant and optimistic and we are certainly looking forward to hunting in the next millennium. There are few protesters compared with the numbers of supporters.\" An hour-long standoff escalated into an emotional frenzy as the men and women of the Essex Farmers &amp; Union Foxhounds hunt approached Maldon high street. Horses and hounds appeared bewildered by the deafening noise as they were corralled between the two camps, while immaculate riders greeted supporters, smoked cigarettes and enjoyed cups of wine before the day's exertions. Police later confirmed that there had been one arrest after hunters and horses were pelted with missiles, including eggs, during their 15-minute appearance in Maldon. Protesters also targeted a meet of the Holcombe Harriers near Bolton, Greater Manchester, and a further 120 activists descended on the Spooners and West Dartmoor hunt's meet in Tavistock, Devon. At the Duke of Beaufort's estate in south Gloucestershire, police estimated there were about 1,500 hunt supporters. The home secretary, Jack Straw, recently offered the hunters a glimmer of hope that the government might be prepared to back down, when he came out against an outright ban, declaring his support for a compromise which would allow the option of tighter licensing of hunts. But the bill is certain to meet passionate opposition in the Lords where peers will be allowed to vote on three options. The Conservative leader, William Hague, is also under backbench pressure to give a commitment to make repealing a ban a top priority if re-elected. Mr Hague was warned last week by the former agriculture secretary Douglas Hogg that he would \"have to look over his shoulder\" if he did not give a clear commitment. He told MPs he was not speaking for himself, but some of his colleagues in saying: \"If we get back in with a majority and the bill is passed, we will do our utmost to ensure that hunting is lawful once again.\" The bill will reach the Lords near the end of February. Discussions have already started on the best sequence of voting to ensure that the Lords get a proper chance to support for their preferred option. It is expected the Commons will vote for an outright ban early next month. The Lords will then be given the option of voting for the ban, a licensing authority or self-regulation. Timetable for bill The hunting bill presents three options: A complete ban on hunting with hounds - put forward by the RSPCA, the League Against Cruel Sports and the International Fund for Animal Welfare under the umbrella group Deadline 2000 Statutory regulation - based on the premise that hunting with dogs should be allowed to continue only on a licensed basis with an enforceable code of conduct - put forward by the cross-party middle way group Self-regulation - put forward by the Countryside Alliance MPs are to vote on the three options in January Bill will then go into standing committee, to be completed by February 8 Expected to go to House of Lords by end of February",

Only three more passengers get on between here and Stafford, almost an hour away.

I met an elderly woman who travelled only as far as the outskirts of Stafford and a sixth-former who got on at a village called Acton Trussell and got off again, 10 minutes later, at Penkridge. For most of the 55-minute journey, I was ferried about in splendid isolation, having spent just \u00a31.60 for what amounted to a lengthy taxi journey into the heart of rural middle England. We splashed down narrow lanes, past flooded fields and into the high streets of villages whose ancient cores are now hemmed in by swathes of new housing with double garages and one, two, sometimes three cars parked on their drives.</p> <p>I'd come to Staffordshire to see what it's like for the 30% of rural folk who don't have access to a car. On their behalf, the government has set about trying to patch up the threadbare service bequeathed by its predecessors.

But although the smart new shelter harboured timetables for several routes, there was nothing to suggest that the 880 might stop here. So I went back into the station and asked at the information desk. Judging by the blank expression that greeted me, I might as well have been asking about flight times from Heathrow.

The 880 pulled up on the dot of 10.35. The county council assures me that timetables for the service have now been installed at its new bus shelters. Meanwhile, members of its transport committee have to decide this month whether or not to subsidise another route in the north of the county due to be de-registered on January 21. It's a classic example of the scenario put forward by Joseph whereby private money is going out of one door as fast as public money is coming in the other.

Such a prospect would deter donors who might reasonably fear they could be pursued by large numbers of unknown offspring seeking emotional or financial support. </p> <p>But the government will consult on a range of options that could allow the children of \"gamete donors\" to build up a picture of the biological parent's characteristics. </p> <p>The least radical option would allow disclosure of non-identifiable information about the donor's background, education, occupation, interests and characteristics such as hair colour. </p> <p>This option is likely to include details of the biological parent's racial background. </p> <p>A second more far reaching option would extend to information that could come closer to identifying the donor, including medical history and family health records. Although this would not be a direct breach of anonymity, it might provide clues that could allow the child to track down a biological parent. </p> <p>A third option will be to give the donor an opportunity to choose to provide a name and address at the time the donation is made that would be available to the child on request. </p> <p>More than 11,000 children have been born by donor insemination since 1991 when the human fertilisation and embryology authority was set up to license fertility clinics and keep records of all sperm and egg donors. </p> <p>Under present regulations children over 18 can be told - after appropriate counselling - whether or not they were conceived by donor insemination. The same applies to children over 16 who want to get married. </p> <p>But in neither case can any information be given about the background or characteristics of the donor. </p> <p>Ms Cooper will reassure past donors that there is no question of changing the law retrospectively and their anonymity will remain protected. </p> <p>Doctors and infertility support groups are concerned that relaxation of the confidentiality rules could discourage potential donors, who are paid on average \u00a315. But there is evidence of confusion and insecurity among children who have been told they were conceived by artificial insemination, but denied further information about their biological parent. </p> <p>Liberty, the civil rights organisation, is bringing a test case under the Human Rights Act on behalf of a brother and sister conceived through donor sperm insemination demanding the right to know details of their father. </p> <p>Adam and Jo Rose, now in their 30s, argue that the law banning disclosure of information about sperm donors is a breach of article 8, the right to respect for private and family life. </p> <p>A Department of Health official said: \"Our proposals are responding to an increase in numbers of gamete donors raising questions of whether people should have the right to know their genetic background. Ministers know this is a sensitive issue and we will need full consultation with interested parties and individuals.\"</p>",

The least radical option would allow disclosure of non-identifiable information about the donor's background, education, occupation, interests and characteristics such as hair colour. This option is likely to include details of the biological parent's racial background. A second more far reaching option would extend to information that could come closer to identifying the donor, including medical history and family health records. Although this would not be a direct breach of anonymity, it might provide clues that could allow the child to track down a biological parent. A third option will be to give the donor an opportunity to choose to provide a name and address at the time the donation is made that would be available to the child on request. More than 11,000 children have been born by donor insemination since 1991 when the human fertilisation and embryology authority was set up to license fertility clinics and keep records of all sperm and egg donors. Under present regulations children over 18 can be told - after appropriate counselling - whether or not they were conceived by donor insemination. The same applies to children over 16 who want to get married. But in neither case can any information be given about the background or characteristics of the donor. Ms Cooper will reassure past donors that there is no question of changing the law retrospectively and their anonymity will remain protected. Doctors and infertility support groups are concerned that relaxation of the confidentiality rules could discourage potential donors, who are paid on average \u00a315. But there is evidence of confusion and insecurity among children who have been told they were conceived by artificial insemination, but denied further information about their biological parent. Liberty, the civil rights organisation, is bringing a test case under the Human Rights Act on behalf of a brother and sister conceived through donor sperm insemination demanding the right to know details of their father. Adam and Jo Rose, now in their 30s, argue that the law banning disclosure of information about sperm donors is a breach of article 8, the right to respect for private and family life. A Department of Health official said: \"Our proposals are responding to an increase in numbers of gamete donors raising questions of whether people should have the right to know their genetic background. Ministers know this is a sensitive issue and we will need full consultation with interested parties and individuals.\"",

      "bodyText": "Boys - and grown men - who kick footballs on street corners in Liverpool while dreaming of scoring the winner at Anfield or Goodison may soon be shown the red card. New by-laws proposed by the Liberal Democrat-controlled city council would ban street football, the traditional nursery for soccer talent, from \"roads, footways, forecourts or grassed areas\". Members of the community safety committee have ordered a report on how a ban could be implemented. But the move has already been condemned as \"bureaucracy gone mad\" by the former Liverpool skipper, Tommy Smith, who learnt his skills on the terraced streets of Kirkdale. Councillors plan to open up school yards and create kick-about areas in public parks to children no longer able to play in the streets. \"We get a constant stream of complaints from residents who are plagued by children playing football outside their homes,\" said Vera Best, a councillor. \"It's often a source of very real hardship for people, who can be afraid to challenge rowdy gangs of teenagers. Sometimes there are even groups of men playing in the street. You can imagine the nightmare for pensioners who have balls kicked at their walls or windows at all hours of the day and night. \"There have been some very nasty cases of pensioners being intimidated. This is a very real problem and one we cannot simply ignore.\" But Mr Smith, a former England international, said the proposals would damage professional and amateur soccer in Liverpool and prevent players of the talent of Robbie Fowler and Steve McMannaman from developing their skills. \"This is a crackpot idea, petty bureaucracy gone mad,\" he said. \"The back streets of Liverpool are the real breeding ground for natural talent. It's no use saying all the kids can join clubs or schoolboy leagues - that happens as they get older.\"",

But many of this latter group are not looking for the older children who form the population in care. In an age when single women look after their own children, there are far fewer babies for adoption - only 4% of adoptions involve children under five years of age, let alone five months. There is an over-supply of families looking for a child aged under five and an under-supply of those wanting older and less easy to manage children. Modern adoption is no longer a one-off process. Adoptive parents need long-term support to help look after their often badly traumatised children. There was not enough readiness to face reality when Tony Blair spoke last week.

Speedier decisions will reduce the damage which children suffer when they are shuffled from one foster family to another: 18% have experienced three placements on adoption, and 14% six. By the time a child has been in care for 18 months, it has an 80% chance of remaining there for at least four years.

Worldwide desertification, the result of a combination of unsustainable farming and global climate change, was found to be advancing quickly and menacing far more people than previously thought. Global deforestation continued apace, with approximately 10.2m hectares lost - a slight improvement on previous years - and there were yet more weather-related disasters around the world. </p> <p> Worryingly, the first global survey of groundwater pollution showed that a toxic brew of pesticides, nitrogen fertilisers, industrial chemicals and heavy metals is fouling fresh water in deep aquifers everywhere. In addition, the ozone hole got bigger and coral reefs were in ever deeper crisis. </p> <p> And 2000 wasn't too kind to people, either. Wealth and natural resources were concentrated into ever fewer hands as most countries dogmatically pursued the path of economic liberalisation and privatisation.

The future of similar sites in Scotland, however, is unclear. And the government is now required to consider biodiversity conservation in all its policies and actions after the Rio Convention was applied in England.

In between, there was record rainfall, record floods, record deaths from the human form of BSE, record low fish catches in the North Sea, record melting of the icecaps, record numbers of rats in Britain and record emissions from the environment secretary following the collapse of the climate talks in the Hague. All the indications are that 2000 was another ecologically disastrous year, with further incremental deterioration of vital resources and eco-systems. Worldwide desertification, the result of a combination of unsustainable farming and global climate change, was found to be advancing quickly and menacing far more people than previously thought. Global deforestation continued apace, with approximately 10.2m hectares lost - a slight improvement on previous years - and there were yet more weather-related disasters around the world. Worryingly, the first global survey of groundwater pollution showed that a toxic brew of pesticides, nitrogen fertilisers, industrial chemicals and heavy metals is fouling fresh water in deep aquifers everywhere. In addition, the ozone hole got bigger and coral reefs were in ever deeper crisis. And 2000 wasn't too kind to people, either. Wealth and natural resources were concentrated into ever fewer hands as most countries dogmatically pursued the path of economic liberalisation and privatisation. International trade made competition tougher and environmental protection measures were further eroded. The patenting of life forms continued at a dizzying pace, world debt grew, despite some notable write-offs in Britain, and the technological gap between rich and poor grew. The number of children with no access to education reached about 125m and, while there are no official figures, the numbers now trying to flee deep poverty and environmentally unsustainable regions is thought to be growing.

St George's Hall, that grand neo-classical building with its mighty columns testifying to the city's shipping wealth, stands opposite the main railway station, prime entrance to the city for those sailing to the New World. And at the centre of the scene, frozen in time like the passing horsedrawn tram beside it, is the familiar Punch &amp; Judy booth and its transfixed crowd.</p> <p>Although this scene, with its top-hatted gentlemen and ladies in bonnets, is from another world now, the Punch &amp; Judy show survives remarkably intact. The master showman in the gaudy booth was one \"Professor Codman\", puppeteer and performer who handed on his skills to his son and grandson, and down the family line to the present day.</p> <p>The Codman family is celebrating 150 years of what they now call The Original Codman's Victorian Punch &amp; Judy Theatre, in a show which has been faithfully passed down to the fifth and sixth generations. As each child learned the skills at his father's and grandfather's knee, the shows have remained faithful to the way they were a century and a half ago.</p> <p>\"As a youngster, the whole thing was magic,\" reflects the present, fifth-generation Prof Codman, 72-year old Ronald Richard Codman. \"It was the clackety-clack of the sticks and the clickety-clack of the crocodile's jaws that fascinated me, and the Punch &amp; Judy show has never really lost its appeal. It's in my blood. The show is a part of my family's roots.\"</p> <p>The first Prof Codman, Richard, was a Norfolk man who learned puppeteering skills from his father and set up his own show in 1850, combining the skills of woodcarver, puppet showman and musician with work in the Norfolk fields when demand for entertainment was slack. He travelled west in a horse-drawn caravan, taking with him the original puppets and theatre and putting on shows as he went, arriving in Liverpool in 1860. He asked the city council for a site, and was given a prime one - an open, cobbled square known as The Quadrant, between the market and what is now Lime Street station.</p> <p>The Punch &amp; Judy show quickly became a local institution. Prof Codman would play pan-pipes to summon an audience, and once a sizeable crowd had gathered the shows would run continuously through the day. The master showman would finish an hour-long show - timed by gas flares, used for illumination, which lasted 60 minutes - and duck out of the booth to let an assistant begin the next show without pause.</p> <p>Richard Codman taught his son, Richard, who taught his son, Richard, father of the present Prof Codman, who is teaching his own son, Robert Richard. They became an institution in the city in its shipping heyday. Prof Codman would stride around town in his frock coat, with his waxed moustache and performing dog, Toby. At one performance inside St George's Hall in the 1920s, the show was in danger of being overwhelmed by the 1,000 children who turned up - the only solution being to have father and grandfather doing shows back to back.</p> <p>But the tradition nearly died with the present Prof Codman. His perfectionist father was reluctant to start the long process of teaching him the skills, and when the nine-year-old Ronald \"borrowed\" a booth without permission to do a show at his school, he was unable to set it up. His father walked in, face like thunder, to see his young son attempting a show on top of some hastily-propped blackboards.</p> <p> When Ronald did learn, it was a long haul. He recalls: \"My father was a fierce critic, and would say: 'That's no good. Your voice isn't right.' He was doing it to make me perform better, and he admitted: 'I want you to be almost better than I am.'\"</p> <p> His grandfather was just as ferocious. \"He'd mutter: 'He's doing it too quickly.' But life is faster now, and my show lasts about 25 minutes. Audiences just wouldn't watch for an hour these days.\"</p> <p> Other things have had to change too. The performing dog, Toby, who bites Punch's nose, has long been considered unsuitable. The Punch puppet beloved of Victorian fairgrounds specialised in a knockabout humour that went well with the walking panoply of fire-eaters and jugglers. The Victorian show was fairly bawdy, and successive Prof Codmans appeared in music hall in a show that would be too risque today.</p> <p>So it is with trepidation that the present professor performs some of the more controversial scenes. A quietly-spoken man with a gentle manner, Ronald does regular shows at the Museum of Liverpool Life, running through the history of the show and asking mildly whether he should do the hangman scene. The response is overwhelming: \"Yes!\" He gazes at the audience for a moment, steps into the booth and is transformed. The pace is fast and furious, as Punch thumps Judy, thumps the beadle, tackles the judge, then takes on the hangman, tricking him into putting his head into his own noose.</p> <p>\"Some people think Punch &amp; Judy was originally a morality play, but I think it was always entertainment,\" says Ronald. \"Punch always gets away with everything, and people like to see him hit a figure of authority over the head and get away with it. Children love it because it is slapstick fun and pure fantasy. As one child put it: 'I like it because they're not real.' But this is also living history, and anyone who thinks Punch &amp; Judy is just for kids has got it wrong. It's for adults, too - and it's part of our folklore.\"</p> <p><strong>Punch lines</strong><br></p> <p>The origins of the Punch &amp;Judy show may date back to Roman times, and some believe that the show is based on the Punchinello figure who has grown into different traditions throughout Europe.</p> <p> The modern tradition may be based on Pulcinella, a professional comedian who performed in Italy in the 17th century.

Boxing Day and all the network's traditional programmes were swept on to long wave to clear the schedules for eight hours and 20 minutes of Quidditch, broomsticks and some very wizard wizardry. Yesterday was renamed Harry Potter Day. Broadcasting Harry Potter and The Philosopher's Stone in its entirety did at least give anti-climactic Boxing Day a new lease of life with Stephen Fry's hugely engaging reading of JK Rowling's first Potter tale on in the background. Atmospheric, funny, and richly evocative, Fry's version will be hard to better. There's no doubt that to broadcast the novel is A Good Thing, as part of Radio 4 controller, Helen Boaden's aim to attract younger listeners to speech radio. She has a dream of twentysomethings of the future looking back fondly to Boxing Day 2000, when they listened to the radio. But to simply play tapes that are already commer cially available - the only difference being that you don't get Fry telling you when to turn the tapes over - and to do so in an extravagant half-day wodge, with a repeated Rowling Desert Island Discs for dessert, doesn't make a \"radio event\". As a means of encouraging children to tune in, a daily dose of Potter over several weeks, with child-friendly programming on either side of each broadcast, would surely have been more effective.

With Russians getting ready to mark what most of them accept as the beginning of the new millennium, he signed a series of laws reintroducing a peculiar mixture of conflicting symbols from the past. They make the national flag the pre-revolutionary tricolour of white, blue and red stripes, the state coat of arms the tsarist two-headed eagle, and the anthem the music selected by Stalin. A red flag similar to that flown by the Soviet army during the second world war was chosen as the army's banner. The reinstatement of such pregnant symbols of the Soviet era coincided with an opinion poll showing that the communist past still evokes great affection and loyalty. The 1,500 questioned voted Vladimir Lenin man of the century and put his successior Josef Stalin in second place, despite the growing awareness of his responsibility for the death of millions of Russians by arbitrary execution and in prison camps. Andrei Sakharov, the human rights advocate and Nobel prizewinner, came third. The government's search for new symbols has been controversial. When earlier this month parliament approved the package of compromises, designed to twist together the communist \"red\" and tsarist \"white\" strands of the country's past, society was split. Many influential writers, film-makers and musicians expressed disgust at the revival of the Soviet anthem, which they said marked \"a moral victory for old communists\". Boris Yeltsin, who abandoned the piece in 1991, was among the critics of its revival. But the stirring music composed by Alexander Alexandrov in 1943 won out: in one poll 49% of those asked loved it, while only with 15% preferred the piece by Glinka chosen to replace it. The government hopes to make it more acceptable by adopting a new set of lyrics. A small presidential committee was set up yesterday to study the options already on offer, and it will probably run a contest to find new verses. Mikhail Mikhalkov, the author of the original text, which paid tribute to the \"unbreakable\" Soviet Union, has already written new words to account for its breaking. Loaded with religious imagery in the place of communist symbolism, it is believed to be Mr Putin's choice. This is his third rewrite - he removed the reference to Stalin in 1977 -and the thought of it being adopted has further dismayed those opposed to Alexandrov's music. Anthems for all How the words changed \u0095 Mikhail Mikhalkov's 2000 version of the anthem: Verse one: With strong wings spread out above us, The Russian eagle completes its flight, And the symbol of the fatherland - the tricolour flag, Guides the people of Russia towards victory Chorus: Glory to our free fatherland, The century-old union of brother nations - The people's wisdom handed down from our ancestors! Glory to the motherland! God is watching over you! \u0095 The 1943 version: Verse two: The sun of freedom shone through the storm, And it was great Lenin who showed us the way. Stalin reared us to be loyal to the people And inspired us to work and great deeds* Chorus: Glory to our free fatherland, Bulwark of the peoples in brotherhood strong. O Soviet banner, the banner of the people, May you lead us from victory to victory! *In 1977 the Stalin lines were replaced with: To a righteous cause he [Lenin] roused all the peoples / Inspired them to work and to great deeds",

The ice cap was found full of water and holes, polar bears started to die and persistent floods swept across Britain.

The British prime minister did make his first ever green speech under some duress saying: \"The environmental challenge continues to grow and become more urgent.\" </p> <p>But not urgent enough, neither to the people nor to their governments. Historians will compare us to Noah's antediluvian citizenry. The geraniums in my window boxes, even the lobelia, still bloom luxuriantly on Christmas day while squirrels who should be asleep eat from the bird table, as it rains and rains. Yet still the strange weather has not moved from nature notes to mainstream politics. </p> <p>After Kyoto there was a concerted corporate denial of global warming. The biggest oil companies - Exxon Mobil, the giant of them all - spent large sums assembling \"scientists\" to attest that it was all nonsense. But in the three years since, the climate has changed yet faster than predicted. The Met Office's advisers have just revised their predictions upwards by two degrees, expecting temperatures to rise by six degrees this century. Water levels will rise by seven metres, wiping out every major coastal city in the world. </p> <p>This is no unimaginable futuristic abstraction: children now born will see all this come to pass. A six- degree increase produces a heat human beings have never known: the last time it was that hot, dinosaurs roamed. There is more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere now than there has been for 20m years. Six of the 10 hottest years have been in the 1990s, the other four in the late 1980s. There has never been a climate change so sharp or fast, with no time for adaptation. </p> <p>So how, British historians will ask, did this play in the election of 2001? Hardly at all, beyond a Tory pledge to abolish the new climate change levy on industry, the government's only creative contribution to global warming. Why the lack of alarm and political salience? Parties who dare not speak of the value of taxation dare suggest no sacrifices, not even for survival. We may have reached the limits of democracy. </p> <p> But if the ballot box can't save us, perhaps the market can. Global insurers are beginning to worry. They will be bankrupt sooner rather than later by predicted calamities in fire, flood and storm. A 10% increase in average windspeed yields 150% more damage. If insurers go bust, so do pension funds and the whole stock market. Recent British floods showed how quickly property becomes uninsurable. How long before that is true of New York, London and all the coastal cities where global capitalism resides? The economic cost of natural disaster is rising by 12% a year: vulnerable Florida alone has a trillion dollars of insured assets, enough to bring everything crashing down. </p> <p>The commercial carrot works as well as the stick. The market is at last waking up to the profits in renewable energy. German, Dutch and even the US governments are investing in the race to bring down the costs of wind and solar power. Britain is barely a player: BP has moved its solar factories to Europe where there are grants, while the UK is unlikely to hit its 2010 target of 10% renewable energy. Instead our government just invested \u00a31bn in North Sea oil exploration, when \u00a3200m could make UK solar power a winner. Labour has commissioned just 100 solar roofs, compared to the German government's 100,000 and a US government plan for one million. </p> <p>A solar roof costs five times more to install than burning fossil fuels, because of the high cost of production. But the price is about to tumble in Germany as volume reduces unit price: the UK will end up importing panels for lack of government action. A trial solar roof on a terrace house in Richmond now feeds surplus electricity into the national grid: no more functionless roofs should ever be built from now on. The DTI dithers instead of kick-starting a huge new manufacturing industry, employing thousands. Architects are conservatively slow to use solar cladding that costs no more than most other cladding for office buildings, with free energy for ever. </p> <p>With less government inertia there are attractive solutions to global warming that don't have to mean wearing the hair shirts that have made the green movement flounder as a political force. Economists, including the Economist, predict renewable energy is about to become the next revolution. Bigger than mobile phones, bigger than computer manufacture. But if Labour doesn't move fast, foreign markets will cash in while we import from them.

But he did it with more style than anyone else, in a way which had more widespread and long-lived appeal. He continued to play his piano, or hilariously failed to play his piano, on tours of the United States, where he mainly lived, and Europe, from where he originated, well into his 80s.</p> <p>Borge always claimed that his deadpan humour succeeded because it was simple and drawn straight from life. If so, its simplicity was that of genius, of being able to impose a thread of distorted but impregnable logic on to almost any set of circumstances.</p> <p>\"What,\" one TV interviewer asked, \"are you doing next?\" \"I guess I'll be going straight to the bathroom.\" Another interviewer asked why he had bought a farm in Portugal. \"Someone,\" he replied, \"had to buy a farm in Portugal.\" Even the ageing process was turned into a dismissive aside: \"It is so much better than the alternative.\"</p> <p>Borge the comic, whose command of the piano was (on stage) liable to grotesque accident, so that a simple piano stool could narrowly escape being a disaster area, turned even his imperilled past as a Danish Jew into the humour of mock conceit: \"Only Churchill and me knew how dangerous Hitler was. Churchill was trying to save Europe, and I was trying to save myself.\"</p> <p>Born in Copenhagen, Borge was the son of a violinist with the Royal Danish Philharmonic. His mother introduced him to the piano from the age of three, and he made his stage debut at the age of eight. There was one great problem which he had to face in his early career - the quality of the on-site pianos he had to play. Some were dreadful, so he developed tricks for playing them not taught by conventional teachers. Out of that situation came his humorous movements and asides, always in a distinctive, unctuous, throwaway voice.</p> <p>By the outbreak of the second world war, Borge was a reasonably successful pianist and musical satirist in Denmark, well known for his guying of Hitler and other Nazis. When the Germans invaded Denmark, newspapers reported that his name was at the head of those destined for extermination. Fortunately for Borge, two Russian diplomats who had been amused by his act smuggled him aboard an American ship bound for Finland, from where he caught the last boat out to the free part of Europe.</p> <p>Once in New York, however, Borge was handicapped by not knowing a word of English. He studied it in cinemas on 42nd Street, watching the same films round and round until he made some sort of sense of what the characters were saying. Being asked to read lines for the warm-up of a radio show led to him being invited to do the same sort of job on air for the Bing Crosby Kraft Music Hall. He understood hardly anything of what he was reading, but his ruptured English made him a success with listeners. He liked to recall that he was nominated second-best radio comedian of the year.</p> <p>Out of this grew his mature act, in which language and logic tortured one another to breaking point. On the west coast, he made music and comedy records for the US war effort, and afterwards developed a repertoire of 15,000 jokes or routines, from which he could make a selection to suit any audience.</p> <p>He devised variations on an early performance, when he had been trying to play seriously. Not trusting his memory, he stuck sheet music inside the piano lid, only to find that in performance it was peeling off around him like leaves in a storm. The counterpoint between his lugubrious dignity and the bizarre things that befell him - like being blasted off his piano stool by a soprano's top note, then producing a safety belt from the stool - could be hilarious.</p> <p>Borge made a unique and highly lucrative niche for himself. He hired his own orchestra for his tours of the US and Canada, and had a 22-acre ranch and pool in the San Fernando Valley, California. His first marriage ended in divorce, and his second marriage, in 1953, was to his manageress, Sanna (who died in September). But when his ex-wife was occupying the ranch, he had to become frugal, setting up a large poultry farm in Connecticut so that he could have a stately home that made a profit.</p> <p>In the 1970s, when more boisterous sorts of comedy became fashionable, he seemed to falter, complaining that the tabloids called him a has-been. During a London visit, he was touchingly grateful that broadsheet critics praised the show. He invigorated his act by introducing as partners a succession of attractive young women.</p> <p>By the 1980s, Borge had got his second wind and looked like going on for ever as an international touring artist. By the 1990s, his initial suspicion of television - he thought his material too narrowly-based for constant TV exposure - had disappeared entirely. He continued touring, with a sell-out audience at the Barbican for his 1992 tour of the US, Australia and Britain.</p> <p>His work for good causes, including Thanks To Scandinavia, a scholarship fund to commemorate Scandinavian efforts to help victims of Nazi persecution, earned him honours in several countries. But bringing laughter pleased him even more than honours. \"The shortest distance between two people is a smile,\" was one of his favourite sayings, and there was always something life-affirming about his studied, quiet, intellectually devious humour.</p> <p>He is survived by a son and daughter from his first marriage, and a son and two daughters from his second.</p> <p>Boerge Rosenbaum (Victor Borge), pianist and comedian, born January 3 1909; died December 23 2000</p>",

Being asked to read lines for the warm-up of a radio show led to him being invited to do the same sort of job on air for the Bing Crosby Kraft Music Hall. He understood hardly anything of what he was reading, but his ruptured English made him a success with listeners. He liked to recall that he was nominated second-best radio comedian of the year. Out of this grew his mature act, in which language and logic tortured one another to breaking point. On the west coast, he made music and comedy records for the US war effort, and afterwards developed a repertoire of 15,000 jokes or routines, from which he could make a selection to suit any audience. He devised variations on an early performance, when he had been trying to play seriously. Not trusting his memory, he stuck sheet music inside the piano lid, only to find that in performance it was peeling off around him like leaves in a storm. The counterpoint between his lugubrious dignity and the bizarre things that befell him - like being blasted off his piano stool by a soprano's top note, then producing a safety belt from the stool - could be hilarious. Borge made a unique and highly lucrative niche for himself. He hired his own orchestra for his tours of the US and Canada, and had a 22-acre ranch and pool in the San Fernando Valley, California. His first marriage ended in divorce, and his second marriage, in 1953, was to his manageress, Sanna (who died in September). But when his ex-wife was occupying the ranch, he had to become frugal, setting up a large poultry farm in Connecticut so that he could have a stately home that made a profit. In the 1970s, when more boisterous sorts of comedy became fashionable, he seemed to falter, complaining that the tabloids called him a has-been. During a London visit, he was touchingly grateful that broadsheet critics praised the show. He invigorated his act by introducing as partners a succession of attractive young women. By the 1980s, Borge had got his second wind and looked like going on for ever as an international touring artist. By the 1990s, his initial suspicion of television - he thought his material too narrowly-based for constant TV exposure - had disappeared entirely. He continued touring, with a sell-out audience at the Barbican for his 1992 tour of the US, Australia and Britain. His work for good causes, including Thanks To Scandinavia, a scholarship fund to commemorate Scandinavian efforts to help victims of Nazi persecution, earned him honours in several countries. But bringing laughter pleased him even more than honours. \"The shortest distance between two people is a smile,\" was one of his favourite sayings, and there was always something life-affirming about his studied, quiet, intellectually devious humour. He is survived by a son and daughter from his first marriage, and a son and two daughters from his second. Boerge Rosenbaum (Victor Borge), pianist and comedian, born January 3 1909; died December 23 2000",

It's a real Pepsi-Coke style confrontation with two big multi-nationals locked in battle for control of the nation's toast. The big news in margarine, in case you missed it, is the development of spreads containing plant extracts said to lower your cholesterol level, and significantly reduce the risk of heart disease. This is a radically different claim from the one Flora used to hit us with in the 70s, when Terry Wogan simply said it would help fight the flab.</p> <p>Technically the new spread is a nutroceutical, occupying the middle ground between food and drug.

So now when Miss Benecol tots up the numbers, she is endorsed by a rival spread. A real low blow for the plucky Finns.</p> <p>Flora, of course, denies that its endorsement of Countdown is intended as an attack on Benecol. It says it just wants to reach the show's audience.</p> <p>It's a dirty war, all right, but the stakes are high.

The best available medical evidence - and over the past 15 years these spreads have been clinically tested more often than any weight-lifting athlete - is that three weeks of spreading a little on your toast at breakfast and tea time will lower your LDL cholesterol by 10-15%.</p> <p>The challenge for the marketing people is to convey this message to people like me who would not recognise low density lipoprotein if it were to knock on their front door and offer to clean the car.</p> <p>Vorderman is one solution.

If you want people to know your product is the result of some pretty brainy work by blokes in labs wearing white coats, but want to go easy on the science, what with people being a little resistant to that kind of thing in the middle of Family Fortunes, conventional wisdom says that Vorderman should open your batting.</p> <p>But Unilever reckons conventional wisdom is talking through its hat, and that the public appetite for Vorderman might be waning.

At a question and answer session afterwards, a determined interrogator persists with questions about the safety of the plant extracts in Flora pro-activ, and is referred to the documents on independent tests. \"He's probably from the competition,\" whispers one of the Flora people, \"a plant.\" In the circumstances, an unfortunate choice of word.</p> <p>This is a fun war, and I am fully behind Unilever's strategy to win hearts and minds.

It's a real Pepsi-Coke style confrontation with two big multi-nationals locked in battle for control of the nation's toast. The big news in margarine, in case you missed it, is the development of spreads containing plant extracts said to lower your cholesterol level, and significantly reduce the risk of heart disease. This is a radically different claim from the one Flora used to hit us with in the 70s, when Terry Wogan simply said it would help fight the flab. Technically the new spread is a nutroceutical, occupying the middle ground between food and drug.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It was a year of theatrical extremes, of long days and short nights. Marathons proliferated. After seeing Peter Stein's 18-hour Faust in Hanover, the Peter Hall-John Barton Tantalus in Denver and Michael Boyd's Henry VI trilogy in Stratford, I thought of claiming overtime. Against that, there were numerous short, interval-free plays that had you out of the theatre in as little as 45 minutes: Dublin Carol, Life x 3, Far Away, Mr Kolpert, Bash, even the Almeida's Tempest. </p> <p>What does all this tell us? That theatre is rapidly changing, and that audiences shun routine and crave something special. It may take the form of a day-long event - the shared experience of watching together from morning to night forges a sense of community. But the profusion of short plays also implies that audiences are happy to have a short, sharp theatrical shock, an intense experience as a prelude to dinner. To reverse Brecht's dictum, first come the morals, then the bread. </p> <p>What is healthy is that playwrights no longer feel bound by the 150-minute rule - the idea that you have to eke out your material to fit a standard length or to boost profits at the bar. The interval, we have discovered, is a social rather than an aesthetic convention. Equally, if it takes you four hours to make your point, as it often does Eugene O'Neill, no one, except a critic who has to file a review on the same night, is really going to object. Form follows function, as architect Louis Sullivan said. A play's length should be determined by artistic vision rather than managerial diktat. Never mind the width, feel the quality. </p> <p>But how good were this year's new plays? No towering masterpieces have emerged but it was a year of solid accomplishment, not least at the Royal Court, which staged an impressive 16 premieres after its February reopening. When people abroad ask how they can stimulate new writing, I always answer that they need a theatre dedicated solely to that purpose. The Royal Court no longer enjoys a monopoly on new writing, but it still remains a powerhouse. Particularly striking this year was the quality of the work coming out of the Court's Theatre Upstairs - The Force of Change, Mr Kolpert, Fireface, 4.48 Psychosis and Far Away. Especially impressive was David Eldridge's Under the Blue Sky, in which teachers' sexual confusion was set against a background of cosmic violence in three interlinked scenes. Here was a young writer making the leap from promise to achievement. </p> <p>In radically different ways all the plays staged by the Court suggested that there is a malaise in society today: from David Hare's idea of addiction as a substitute for conviction in My Zinc Bed to Caryl Churchill's Far Away with its vision of Armageddon. But, without straitjacketing writers, I feel it might be profitable if they wrote to a specific brief. This year I even suggested to the Royal Court that, given the likelihood of a renewal of Labour's mandate next year, now might be a good time to examine Blair's Britain. Some argued that plays are too much a matter of personal gestation to be arbitrarily conceived; elsewhere I detected flickers of interest. My point is that playwrights may need a nudge to address not just their subjective unease but the state of the nation at large. </p> <p>But it was a lively year all round for new writing. Marie Jones's Stones in His Pockets and Gary Mitchell's The Force of Change suggested that Belfast is a real source of energy. Joe Penhall's Blue/Orange, though it sometimes stretched credibility, was the National Theatre's best new play for a long time. And, on all sides, young women writers made their mark: Zinnie Harris with Further Than the Furthest Thing, Helen Blakeman with Normal and, most astonishing of all, Joanna Laurens with The Three Birds at the Gate. Having missed the opening, I went to Laurens's play as a civilian rather than as a critic and was bowled over by her re-telling of the Tereus and Philomel myth - in particular by her bold poetic diction with its coinages, inversions and dislocated rhythms. I'd say she is the most original theatrical voice to have emerged since Sarah Kane. </p> <p>What new writing most needs at the moment, as David Hare recently suggested, is for dramatists to recognise that \"the external universe may be richer and more suggestive than the inside of their own heads\". Correspondingly, what the classic theatre needs is to realise that there are more than 50 golden oldies - half of them by Shakespeare - doomed to endless, eternal revival. At this stage of history, is there any crying need for yet another production of The Seagull? Far more interesting this year were the attempts to explore theatrical byways. The Royal Shakespeare Company gave us George Bernard Shaw's dottily engrossing Back to Methuselah, and the Orange Tree presented a multiracial, pleasurably fantastic Arms and the Man. The Oxford Stage Company toured Somerset Maugham's The Circle, proving he was more than just a boulevard cynic. The Nottingham Playhouse, much livelier under director Giles Croft, shook the dust off JM Barrie's Dear Brutus. They showed him to be one of the eeriest theatrical talents of the 20th century. </p> <p> Lazy thinking, as much as underfunding, is the British theatre's biggest enemy - in particular an ignorance of the repertory that simply assumes audiences want the same old stuff endlessly recycled. My plaudits go to theatres that offered something original. That includes the Gate for its season under Mick Gordon dubbed Loves Work, devoted to the byzantine irregularities of passion. But I'd also nominate Birmingham Rep, where director Bill Alexander ended a difficult few years with a season including Indhu Rubasingham's startling version of The Ramayana. This spiritual odyssey, based on a Sanskrit saga, would have had critics flocking if it had come from abroad. And where else but Glasgow Citizens would you expect to find a piece like Mae West's The Pleasure Man, which was ramshackle but gaudily watchable? </p> <p>In an ideal world, the National Theatre would be leading the way in extending the repertory. The one really adventurous choice this year, apart from the new plays by Penhall and Harris, was the Pinter-Proust Remembrance of Things Past, which was a genuine distillation of a great novel rather than a mere reduction. But, dipping into Kenneth Tynan's letters recently, I came across a memo he wrote in 1967 to Olivier, during his period as the National's literary manager: \"What the National Theatre does has become a matter of public acceptance rather than public excitement.\" For all the National's solid successes, that's rather how I feel; and 2001's revival of My Fair Lady, however dazzling, isn't going to solve the problem. </p> <p>The initiative has passed to other theatres. To the Royal Court. To the RSC, which, a few duff shows aside, had a tremendous year with its Stratford history cycle, dominated by Steven Pimlott's revisionist Richard II. And to the Almeida, which gave us cunningly paired Shakespeares in Shoreditch, Nicholas Wright's clever Cressida in the West End and a mixed bag at its base, of which the prize exhibit was Pinter's feisty double-bill of Celebration and The Room. I read suggestions that Ian McDiarmid and Jonathan Kent are getting tired of doing questing, international seasons on a relatively paltry subsidy of \u00a3450,000. Isn't it about time grants were related to achievement instead of barnacled custom? </p> <p>But one can't sum up British theatre in 2000 without saying something about the quality of the acting. Inevitably if Simon Russell Beale plays Hamlet or Michael Gambon takes on Davies in The Caretaker you expect them to be brilliant, and so they were. But I was struck this year by the excellence of work from less familiar, and even totally unknown names. It was heartening to find Paola Dionisotti picking up an Evening Standard award for her display of stubborn tenacity in Further Than the Furthest Thing. But Conleth Hill and Sean Campion, now en route for Broadway, deserved a special joint award for their miraculous double act in Stones in His Pockets. I also find myself remembering Sheila Hancock's love-awakened teacher in the David Eldridge play at the Court, Sean Caffrey's duplicitous dourness as the RUC detective in The Force of Change, Catherine McCormack lending style and tremulous sensitivity to the mysterious outsider in All My Sons at the National and - not least - a young actress called Jenny Jules who swept through Alice Childress's Wine in the Wilderness at the Tricycle Theatre with gale-force energy. </p> <p>As ever, the British theatre brims with talent. And, as always, one hopes that in the year ahead it will be matched by a sense of risk and adventure on the part of our theatre directors. All too often that descends into a nervous populism. Writing in 1903, Chekhov condemned exactly that kind of pandering to familiar tastes claiming: \"It's a question not of reducing Gogol to the people's level but of raising the people up to his.\" Exactly. And a bit more of that idealism wouldn't come amiss in 2001. </p> <p> <strong> Michael Billington's top 10 </strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> The Force of Change</strong> at the Royal Court. Gary Mitchell's passionate thriller. </p> <p><strong> Under the Blue Sky</strong> at the Royal Court. Sex among the teachers: a compassionate play by David Eldridge. </p> <p><strong> Stones In His Pockets </strong> at the Duke of York's.

As ever, the British theatre brims with talent. And, as always, one hopes that in the year ahead it will be matched by a sense of risk and adventure on the part of our theatre directors. All too often that descends into a nervous populism. Writing in 1903, Chekhov condemned exactly that kind of pandering to familiar tastes claiming: \"It's a question not of reducing Gogol to the people's level but of raising the people up to his.\" Exactly. And a bit more of that idealism wouldn't come amiss in 2001. Michael Billington's top 10 The Force of Change at the Royal Court. Gary Mitchell's passionate thriller. Under the Blue Sky at the Royal Court. Sex among the teachers: a compassionate play by David Eldridge. Stones In His Pockets at the Duke of York's. A celebration of acting in Marie Jones's firecracker about Irish movie extras. The Three Birds at the Gate. Stunning debut piece from Joanna Laurens. Philomel loses her tongue but a writer finds her voice. The Caretaker at the Comedy Theatre. Michael Gambon in Pinter's classic. Richard II at the Barbican. Steven Pimlott's brilliant start to the Shakespeare history cycle: Samuel West and David Troughton in prime form. A Doll's House at the Lyceum, Edinburgh. Triumphant Norwegian import: Ibsen's Nora as domestic prostitute. Tantalus, on tour through UK from January. The Greek myths unfold in John Barton's 10-play cycle. Unforgettable. Faust, currently in Berlin. Peter Stein's superb version of Goethe's masterpiece. The Ramayana at Birmingham Rep. Magic-packed treatment of a Sanskrit saga.",

She suggested that we didn't walk down the Barbie aisle any more as it was far too pink. She had to cover her eyes. It made her sick.

Beanie babies replaced ... Beanie babies. (They must put something in them, or up them, so that - however pierced she becomes - she'll be collecting them until she's the appropriate age to collect them. Which is 67.) And halfway through violin practice - something she is beginning to suspect is forced on her as some kind of cosmic joke and which, between you and me, I must admit makes me chuckle occasionally - she first uttered the immortal phrase: \"I hate my life.\" The ex-punk in me cheered; the middle-class parent marched her off to her room so that we could sit down and count her blessings.

She might be right, but I was hoping to keep it from her for a few more years. My lovable-eccentric ways are becoming irritating to her. I started 2000 as Funny Daddy, slipped during the year to acceptable figure of fun, and I am now all set to become the standard object of complete and utter scorn. By 2002, Maddy won't want me walking with her to the kitchen, let alone the tattoo parlour; her bedroom will be black, and Buffy the vampire slayer will have wiped out Barbie (who must be a vampire, so that makes sense). \"Daddy\" will have become \"Dad\": two syllables of unquestioning adoration becoming one hard syllable that takes things for granted.</p> <p>I'm wondering if all these changes have something to do with my full-blooded performance of the Village People YMCA dance at her eighth birthday party last January. This was perhaps the moment when things turned. Maddy was no longer my little baby and it was no longer OK that I was Funny Daddy. She told me her schoolfriends commented on my exuberance.

In any case, we were estranged: he did not even know his granddaughter was due. And I wish I could say I wept, but I didn't. I didn't love my father. I had known since I was about 12 that I could not rely on him to show me any sort of love, let alone caring. His being alive was a constant reminder to me that I did not deserve - had not earned - his love. His death barely touched me.</p> <p>But these days, when I see my boys and my girl (now a clever, curvy, all-but-10-year-old) playing, chatting, messing around joyfully with their own father, my heart aches. Here they are, safe with a man on whose undying affection, energy and commitment they can rely. And they know it.</p> <p>\"I hate you!\" our 11-year-old yelled at him the other day when deprived of a further hour's Nintendo. I envied my son. At his age, I was anxiously polite to my father. Our fragile relationship lay in my skinny, nail-bitten hands. I never knew what sudden, unforeseeable blunder might make him turn away in disgust.</p> <p>Virtually all my early memories of him are about sex. He liked Benny Hill, G-strings, Penthouse. When he married my mum, he was 32 and a mother's boy. I know he'd had one girlfriend, because years later he still went on about her - showing me photos of this icy, groomed blonde whose breasts poked at her sweater like ice-cream cones. On top of his wardrobe, he kept a photo of a nude woman straddling a chair. I thought she looked uncomfortable. Like the bare ladies lolling in prickly haystacks in his magazines, which we also giggled over. Though my mother was young and beautiful, my father felt that the 60s had come too late for him, that he'd missed out on the \"permissive era\". Other people's fathers went on about cars or sport or DIY. I was only eight but I knew mine was weird.</p> <p>Girls should worship and adore their fathers. Mine was sometimes a laugh but, now that I'm older and he's safely gone, I understand that he revolted me. I was 12 when my mother - lonely, weary, brave - finally left him. Her leaving had two side-effects: it took me from him; good. And it left me (and my two younger sisters) alone with him; bad.</p> <p>Every other weekend. That's what the judge said - and it was what my father wanted. Up to a point. He certainly wanted power over us, since it was his only means of getting back at Her. But once she'd gone, he became more and more embittered, angry and unkind, looking around obsessively for ways to hurt us. He refused to pay for a prescription when we stayed with him, wouldn't heat our rooms, or take us out anywhere. He scissored our mother's head out of every photo in the family album, and made us read aloud the affidavit for the divorce proceedings, which detailed her supposed adultery with our stepfather-to-be. I remember him ordering me to explain a sexual term to my eight-year-old sister: when I flushed and stumbled, he accused me of being \"on Her side\". I can see now what I couldn't see then: that he enjoyed an irresponsible, even unsavoury frisson when he saw us grapple with those words, those problems.</p> <p>Every other Friday, he would drive over to collect us. He arrived later and later. I was 13, desperate to avoid a scene. My stomach would churn as I bobbed backwards and forwards, checking for his car. The deal was this: we had to leave the house immediately and speedily with our bags, so that he didn't have to spend time looking at \"our mother's house\". Also, we weren't allowed to refer to this place as \"home\" or mention Mum, the \"streak of piss\" she lived with, or his sons (our stepbrothers) by name. Naturally, we sometimes tripped up. I remember saying \"Mummy\" once by mistake and blushing to the roots of my hair. There were so many rules, I was sometimes almost sick trying to remember them.</p> <p>His car smelled of cigarette smoke. He liked cars. He drove them and smoked in them and killed himself in one, but he never used them to do anything imaginative like leave Nottingham and see the world. The Audi's upholstery was sort of blond corduroy. He frequently asked us if we liked the colour. Yes, we said enthusiastically, we loved it. He used to ask me - incessantly, and sometimes in front of people - whether I had started my periods. I always shivered with embarrassment, always told him no. When I did start, I kept it quiet, but dreaded the possibility of staining that perfect blond upholstery.</p> <p>At night, he would come and kiss us goodnight as he always had in the old life, except that our rooms were now depressing with their naked bulbs, lack of soft furnishing, knick-knacks or heating. When my mother left, she had taken half the furniture with her. He refused to replace anything. It was her choice, he reminded us again and again, that we lived like this. We came from a broken home, didn't we? Well, now we could reap the consequences.</p> <p>I was 13, and then 14, and when he said goodnight, he put his tongue in my ear. When he did it to my younger sisters, they still shrieked with laughter. When he did it to me, I shuddered but didn't dare ask him to stop. I will never knock from my brain the memory of his moist tongue probing the inner shell of my ear.</p> <p>When I was 16, he tried to get me to leave school, even though he was supposed to pay our school fees until we were 18. My mother took him to court and I was asked to pen a \"polite and loving\" note to my father, to be read out in court, explaining why I wanted to stay on.

Two very brave American infantrymen, one of them a friend of mine named Ron Ridenhour and one named Tom Glen, had reported to their superiors - and in Ron's case to his congressman - a day-long orgy of murder, torture and rape in the above-named village, conducted by soldiers of the Americal Division of the US army. Glen's letter was forwarded to then-Major Colin Powell, who was then on the staff at Division HQ. Asked to draft a memo that would take care of matters, Powell wrote that Tom Glen had not come forward quickly enough and that his evidence was second-hand. \"Relations between Americal soldiers and the Vietnamese people are excellent,\" concluded this ambitious young officer.

Colin Powell would have had no career if it wasn't for the first of those decisions. But when Clinton was elected in 1992 on a clear promise to lift the ban on homosexuals in uniform, Powell successfully led a near-mutiny to get him to back down.

Up until now, it has been restrained by protests from other countries, from scientists, from arms-control experts and from elements in the State Department.

With David Coleman stepping down after 46 years, and Peter O'Sullevan enjoying a richly deserved retirement, it really is the end for the Grandstand commentary team who came to prominence after the war as TV and sport combined to take over our lives.</p> <p>Walker, who is 77, has been getting some ageist flak in the tabloids, and says he is stepping down before the punters agree with the papers. \"I want to go out while I'm ahead,\" he says, \"because there are few things more pathetic than the chap who's hanging on desperately when the liking for him has gone and the control he has of the subject has gone.\" None of that, he hastens to add, has happened yet, but you never know what may be around the corner. Walker was an advertising executive for almost 40 years and evidently likes to play the percentages.</p> <p>It is, as Walker himself points out, a journalistic cliche to trot out all the Murrayisms that have been the hallmark of his commentary over the years, but what the heck? \"Do my eyes deceive me, or is Senna's Lotus sounding rough?\" \"He's obviously gone in for a wheel change. I say obviously because I can't see it.\" \"With half the race gone, there is half the race still to go.\" \"Tambay's hopes, which were nil before, are absolutely zero now.\" (Those of you who would like to read several hundred more of these should refer to <a href=\"http://www.worldmotorsport.com/murray/\" target=\"_NEW\">www.worldmotorsport.com/murray/</a>.</p> <p>In fact, his reputation for mistakes was the making of Walker. He was always the fan who happened to have been given the keys to the commentary box: he couldn't control his enthusiasm and that seemed naturally to lead to catastrophe. Invariably, his reference to the ease with which a driver was winning a race would immediately be followed by the car skidding off the track, hitting a hoarding and somersaulting three times before disappearing into a ditch.</p> <p>These incidents were replayed lovingly every year as part of the BBC's Sports Review of the Year, and the latter lost its most popular item when Walker followed formula one to ITV in 1996. \"Unless I'm very much mistaken ... I AM very much mistaken!\" became Walker's catchphrase: he might consider it a slur on his professionalism, but it made sure he was remembered. \"We all make mistakes, but when I made mistakes there was no filter between me and the consumer,\" says Walker.</p> <p>He has always been a conscientious mugger-up of facts and statistics, making sure he was prepared for any commentary, but the root of his popularity was the unalloyed joy his sport gave him. \"I stand up in the commentary box, I get very excited, I rush about pointing at the screen. Most people seem to think I have about 16 monitors giving me a total view of the course. I don't. I have a monitor which gives me the picture that you see and everybody else sees at home.\"</p> <p>From 1949, when he covered his first event, until 1982, when he retired from the ad agency where he had worked for 36 years, commentary was a sideline. \"It was a hobby, like collecting stamps or chasing butterflies, but in 1978 the BBC said they were going to do all the grands prix and wanted me to do them, and that's when it started to take over.\"</p> <p>Walker was born into motor racing. His father, Graham, was a TT champion, and Walker junior saw his first race when he was two. \"I was soaked in the sport all through my childhood, and I was either going to like it or loathe it. I liked it, but I didn't really become enthusiastic to the point of obsession until after the war. I was in a tank regiment during the war, and started a brigade motorcycle club. When I came out I started racing, believing that I would show my father how to do it, but I very rapidly discovered that I wouldn't.\"</p> <p>Failing to match his father's achievements didn't undermine him - he did far too well in the ad business for that - but did leave a mark. \"It is difficult being the son of a famous father. You've always got this thing looming over you. I worshipped my father, but I remember thinking when I heard someone say, 'That's Graham Walker's son', I would like someone to point at my father and say 'That's Murray Walker's father.' I would be a lot prouder of myself if I had been world champion rather than just talking about it.\"</p> <p>Instead of pursuing a career on the track, however, he chose the security of an ad agency. \"I was a moderately good club-standard rider, but I suppose the truth is that it didn't matter enough to me and I chose to put my business career before trying to become a motorcycle superstar. But the enthusiasm remained and I sublimated it into talking about it.\" He began commentating on motorsports, especially motorbike racing, and during the 50s the Walkers formed a father-and-son commentary team.</p> <p>Walker has two voices: one for conversation, the other for commentary. The latter is more a screech and resembles a 500cc engine being revved up. \"I'm very lucky because I have got a voice that suits my sport,\" he says. \"It's nothing that you can train yourself to have or to be. I deal with a harsh, aggressive, noisy, fast-moving sport and I have a harsh, aggressive, noisy, fast-moving voice.\"</p> <p>In the early days of Grandstand, the commentary roster was fluid. Walker did a spot of rowing, but made the mistake of mocking the chaps in pink blazers (they were members of the crack Leander club). He also did some weightlifting, but eventually the motorsport took over and he became the voice of his sport. In his farewell year, he will commentate on 12 grands prix, leaving the other five open for ITV to try out possible replacements. He will be a tough act to follow.</p> <p>For all the mistakes and malapropisms, there is a fund of goodwill towards him - when I met him he was signing hundreds of copies of his new book, Murray Walker's Formula One Heroes, for an adoring National Sporting Club audience in Manchester. That adoration has managed to survive his antediluvian attitudes. He has strong views on the place of women in motorsport: they don't have one. When I ask him how he would feel if a woman replaced him, he has a one-word answer: \"Gutted.\" \"I'm being chauvinistic, I know that, but motor racing is a male sport. If I hear a woman talking about cricket, I feel the same way. I have got nothing against women: my wife was a woman, my mother was a woman.\" This line may have been common in adman circles in about 1962.</p> <p>Walker is also a chauvinist when it comes to Brits winning motor races. His three fondest memories are the races in which James Hunt, Nigel Mansell and Damon Hill took the world titles. The last of those - Damon Hill's triumph in 1996 - was especially sweet. \"I had commentated on his father, double world champion Graham Hill, who was then killed and the family fell on very hard times. Damon fought his way up from nothing. Although he has an enormous amount of talent, he succeeded because he worked on that talent rather more than others more naturally gifted had to. He won the championship at the last event, the Japanese grand prix, and when he crossed the line to win the race and the championship, the whole thing welled up inside me and I said, 'I've got to stop, I've got a lump in my throat.'

He sits rather oddly with the snazzy, souped-up world of formula one, with its TV billions and corporate logos, a throwback to another age, who managed to survive all the revolutions in motor racing. He promises not to be a nuisance when he retires. \"I will still go to races, but I'm not going to be a pathetic old hanger-on in the paddock saying, 'Do you remember when Fangio won in 1951?'\" Just don't mention the motor racing-mad woman up in the ITV commentary box.</p>",

Simon Louvish London \u0095 I was very moved by Ahdaf Soueif's articles (A Palestinian journey, December 18 and 19). I often think that the media are so biased and one-sided in the western world that the Palestinian cause has no hope and the atrocities committed by the Israeli government will go unheard. However, the Guardian does give me hope, in a country where the press is dominated by the right. Please keep up the good reporting and continue to publish material which gives a true account of current affairs. Purvis Ghani Nottingham",

      "body": "<p>It has been a tough Christmas for staff at Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham. The two firms' \u00a3114bn merger comes into effect today, creating the world's largest drugs company. Few will be hanging out the bunting. </p> <p>The festive season has been marked by anxiety as employees wonder if they will have a place in the combined corporation. Unions expect between 2,000 and 5,000 redundancies from a workforce of 23,000 in this country, with up to 15,000 job losses worldwide. </p> <p>One woman having a cigarette last week outside Glaxo's west London head office summed up the mood: \"We've been climbing the walls all year - this thing's been going on for ever.\" She is one of the lucky ones - close to retirement. \"If you've got a family and a mortgage it's very difficult.\" </p> <p>Behind Glaxo's sprawling headquarters in suburban Middlesex, on the edge of an industrial estate in Greenford, the wood-panelled Black Horse is the pub of choice for employees. </p> <p>The bar staff are among the few to be delighted at the impending deal because money has been rolling in from a series of parties. \"We don't know which ones are Christmas do's and which ones are leaving do's,\" a barman said. </p> <p>Few Greenford workers are prepared to talk, with their jobs in the balance. \"I really can't say anything at all,\" says one smartly dressed man hurrying into the complex. A security guard then emerges to demand no more \"intrusion\" on Glaxo employees. </p> <p>Officially, today marks a new dawn for Britain's pharmaceuticals industry, the creation of a rarity: a British company that leads the world in its sector. </p> <p>GlaxoSmithKline will be the country's third-biggest corporation, with a market value of \u00a3114.3bn. In the drugs industry, it eclipses rivals such as AstraZeneca, which is worth \u00a359bn, and its market share of 7% is a shade ahead of its nearest rival, Pfizer of the US, which recently merged with Warner Lambert. </p> <p>The birth has been protracted.

      "bodyText": "It has been a tough Christmas for staff at Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham. The two firms' \u00a3114bn merger comes into effect today, creating the world's largest drugs company. Few will be hanging out the bunting. The festive season has been marked by anxiety as employees wonder if they will have a place in the combined corporation. Unions expect between 2,000 and 5,000 redundancies from a workforce of 23,000 in this country, with up to 15,000 job losses worldwide. One woman having a cigarette last week outside Glaxo's west London head office summed up the mood: \"We've been climbing the walls all year - this thing's been going on for ever.\" She is one of the lucky ones - close to retirement. \"If you've got a family and a mortgage it's very difficult.\" Behind Glaxo's sprawling headquarters in suburban Middlesex, on the edge of an industrial estate in Greenford, the wood-panelled Black Horse is the pub of choice for employees. The bar staff are among the few to be delighted at the impending deal because money has been rolling in from a series of parties. \"We don't know which ones are Christmas do's and which ones are leaving do's,\" a barman said. Few Greenford workers are prepared to talk, with their jobs in the balance. \"I really can't say anything at all,\" says one smartly dressed man hurrying into the complex. A security guard then emerges to demand no more \"intrusion\" on Glaxo employees. Officially, today marks a new dawn for Britain's pharmaceuticals industry, the creation of a rarity: a British company that leads the world in its sector. GlaxoSmithKline will be the country's third-biggest corporation, with a market value of \u00a3114.3bn. In the drugs industry, it eclipses rivals such as AstraZeneca, which is worth \u00a359bn, and its market share of 7% is a shade ahead of its nearest rival, Pfizer of the US, which recently merged with Warner Lambert. The birth has been protracted. The US federal trade commission took months to decide whether a handful of smoking-cessation products conflicted, an issue still unresolved. Meanwhile, \"FDA\" has become an unpleasant acronym for insiders as the US food and drug administration ordered withdrawal of Glaxo's much-hyped Lotronex, for irritable bowel syndrome, and refused approval for SmithKline's antibiotic Factive. Together with the failure of a late-stage heart drug in SmithKline's portfolio, these setbacks cost as much as \u00a3900m in annual sales. Today's merger is being made as low key as possible. Even announcement of a new logo and corporate identity has been postponed, and chief executive Jean-Pierre Garnier is refusing interviews. Insiders say the setbacks mean even more savings will be sought to make the merger pay. The two groups have promised \u00a3750m of annual synergies but this figure could be increased to as much as \u00a31bn. Mr Garnier is considered an ascetic boss who is big on efficiency and low on sentiment. Based in Philadelphia, which many believe will be the genuine HQ of the \"British\" company, he has rationed the disclosure of personal information.

Heritage had always been good for local trade, but now there was a dramatic edge of elegant modernity to gratify the locals and attract the visitors. Suddenly this was a renaissance city, an affair of courtyards and galleries, of walkways, avenues and towers which revealed new vistas and perspectives to feed the mind and delight the spirit. Forgotten buildings were reborn and new ones rose from the ground.

      "bodyText": "The biggest event in the fox hunting calendar went ahead amid bitter scenes yesterday as thousands of protesters turned out to jeer and heckle riders at Boxing Day meets across the country. Emotions ran high on both sides of the political divide less than a week after MPs voted heavily in favour of a second reading of the government bill banning fox hunting in England and Wales. The national debate was most fiercely played out in Maldon, Essex, where members of the hunting lobby and protesters took up positions on opposite sides of the narrow high street in a face-off lasting several hours. Traffic was diverted from the usually quiet town centre as two small armies of more than 500, hemmed in by crash barriers and police, taunted each other as they waited for the local hunt to pass through. Protesters waved placards showing pictures of brutalised foxes as they declared \"moral war\" on the hunting lobby. One activist, a hunt saboteur for 20 years, said the feeling was one of \"now or never\". The 53-year-old professional who declined to be named, said: \"This is our finest hour.

The home secretary, Jack Straw, recently offered the hunters a glimmer of hope that the government might be prepared to back down, when he came out against an outright ban, declaring his support for a compromise which would allow the option of tighter licensing of hunts. But the bill is certain to meet passionate opposition in the Lords where peers will be allowed to vote on three options. The Conservative leader, William Hague, is also under backbench pressure to give a commitment to make repealing a ban a top priority if re-elected. Mr Hague was warned last week by the former agriculture secretary Douglas Hogg that he would \"have to look over his shoulder\" if he did not give a clear commitment. He told MPs he was not speaking for himself, but some of his colleagues in saying: \"If we get back in with a majority and the bill is passed, we will do our utmost to ensure that hunting is lawful once again.\" The bill will reach the Lords near the end of February.

It is expected the Commons will vote for an outright ban early next month. The Lords will then be given the option of voting for the ban, a licensing authority or self-regulation. Timetable for bill The hunting bill presents three options: A complete ban on hunting with hounds - put forward by the RSPCA, the League Against Cruel Sports and the International Fund for Animal Welfare under the umbrella group Deadline 2000 Statutory regulation - based on the premise that hunting with dogs should be allowed to continue only on a licensed basis with an enforceable code of conduct - put forward by the cross-party middle way group Self-regulation - put forward by the Countryside Alliance MPs are to vote on the three options in January Bill will then go into standing committee, to be completed by February 8 Expected to go to House of Lords by end of February",

Cameras would be allowed to film three types of hearing - appeal court hearings, judicial reviews and Lords hearings.</p> <p>If the law had been in place in the past year, cameras would have filmed three high-profile cases - Neil Hamilton's libel appeal last week, which he lost; Sinn Fein's ongoing judicial review against David Trimble's decision to ban the party from a special cross-border ministerial body; and the full House of Lords hearings into General Pinochet.</p> <p>One minister said the public should have been able to see the whole Pinochet case instead of the \"shoot-outs\" when cameras were only able to film individual law lords as they stood up to deliver their rulings: \"It was a pity that you only saw the shoot-outs in the Pinochet case because the rules only allowed the televising of the Lords chamber and not the presentation of cases.\"</p> <p>But ministers are expected to draw the line at filming jury trials and magistrates' courts. The minister said: \"There would be a danger of a member of the jury seeing edited highlights of a court case on the television. That section could then be blown out of all proportion in his or her mind.\"</p> <p>Ministers on the review group, which is chaired by the lord chancellor, Lord Irvine of Lairg, and which includes the home secretary, Jack Straw, are following the example of the Scottish judicial system which has allowed cameras into courts since 1992, provided all sides agree.</p> <p>The ministerial review complements a review of the criminal courts being carried out by the appeal court judge, Lord Justice Auld.</p> <p>Previous attempts to change the 1925 Criminal Justice Act, which prohibits cameras in English and Welsh courts, have failed. A backbench bill, drawn up with the support of the Bar Council in 1991, fell for lack of government support.</p> <p>Since then the judiciary has opposed the televising of court proceedings. Lord Bingham of Cornhill, the former lord chief justice, said it would \"increase enormously\" the stress of everyone involved.</p> <p>In the Today interview his successor highlighted the judiciary's new awareness of the importance of the media. \"I want to try to explain to the public what judges are about,\" Lord Woolf said.</p> <p>You only saw the shoot-outs in the Pinochet case because the rules allowed the televising of the Lords chamber and not the presentation of cases</p>",

In an interview with the Today programme Lord Woolf said: \"What I believe is critically important is to contribute to public confidence in the system. I think, in the same way as the police are getting much better at going into schools, so we have got a message to give, because we play a very important role in society.\" Ministers hope to take a big step towards fostering confidence when they unveil plans after the election to allow cameras into courts. Cameras would be allowed to film three types of hearing - appeal court hearings, judicial reviews and Lords hearings. If the law had been in place in the past year, cameras would have filmed three high-profile cases - Neil Hamilton's libel appeal last week, which he lost; Sinn Fein's ongoing judicial review against David Trimble's decision to ban the party from a special cross-border ministerial body; and the full House of Lords hearings into General Pinochet. One minister said the public should have been able to see the whole Pinochet case instead of the \"shoot-outs\" when cameras were only able to film individual law lords as they stood up to deliver their rulings: \"It was a pity that you only saw the shoot-outs in the Pinochet case because the rules only allowed the televising of the Lords chamber and not the presentation of cases.\" But ministers are expected to draw the line at filming jury trials and magistrates' courts. The minister said: \"There would be a danger of a member of the jury seeing edited highlights of a court case on the television. That section could then be blown out of all proportion in his or her mind.\" Ministers on the review group, which is chaired by the lord chancellor, Lord Irvine of Lairg, and which includes the home secretary, Jack Straw, are following the example of the Scottish judicial system which has allowed cameras into courts since 1992, provided all sides agree. The ministerial review complements a review of the criminal courts being carried out by the appeal court judge, Lord Justice Auld. Previous attempts to change the 1925 Criminal Justice Act, which prohibits cameras in English and Welsh courts, have failed. A backbench bill, drawn up with the support of the Bar Council in 1991, fell for lack of government support. Since then the judiciary has opposed the televising of court proceedings. Lord Bingham of Cornhill, the former lord chief justice, said it would \"increase enormously\" the stress of everyone involved. In the Today interview his successor highlighted the judiciary's new awareness of the importance of the media. \"I want to try to explain to the public what judges are about,\" Lord Woolf said. You only saw the shoot-outs in the Pinochet case because the rules allowed the televising of the Lords chamber and not the presentation of cases",

      "body": "<p>Billy \"King Rat\" Wright struck terror into the heart of mid-Ulster as one of Northern Ireland's most ruthless loyalist paramilitaries.</p> <p>Now, three years after republicans gunned him down in a high security jail, his father, David, ironically finds himself in a similar position to several nationalist families, battling for inquiries into murders they suspect the state might have played a part in.</p> <p>The government has admitted there were serious security lapses in the Maze prison on the day Wright was killed, but strenuously denied there was collusion.</p> <p>Lagan Valley Ulster Unionist MP Jeffrey Donaldson has also called for an immediate inquiry into thekilling. He said: \"The murder of Billy Wright had the potential to up-end the entire peace process. It is essential something like this never happens again inside a prison.</p> <p>\"We need answers to many unresolved questions, both so that the Wright family can learn the truth and so the public interest can be served. There should be an independent inquiry</p> <p>\"My interest in this issue is not in terms of an interest in paramilitarism but I am concerned about the circumstances of this murder in the Maze, in my constituency.\"</p> <p>Wright's father has vowed to fight for answers to his questions: \"I will not rest until I get a full inquiry into the death of my son. He was murdered while under the care of the state.\"</p> <p>On one wall of the neat living room in David Wright's tiny, red-brick terrace house is a faded, framed newspaper article about his father Billy's shoe shop and antique business, which begins: \"The name of Wright is one that holds an honoured tradition in Portadown.\"</p> <p>From another wall, a colour photograph of a tough-looking, intense, young man with close-cropped hair and a checked shirt, stares down. This young man, named Billy after his grandfather, was also well known in mid-Ulster, although infamous would be a better description.</p> <p><b> Sentence</b><br></p> <p>Billy Wright was shot dead by the Irish National Liberation Army in the Maze on December 271997 where he was serving an eight-year sentence for threatening to kill a woman.</p> <p>Security sources claim that Wright, 37, once the local Ulster Volunteer Force leader and later boss of the breakaway Loyalist Volunteer faction, was behind up to 20 brutal murders, although he was never convicted of any.</p> <p>\"He put the fear of God into people,\" said one man. \"There is no doubt that as a UVF leader he was blooded in violence but it is difficult to separate the myth from the reality. A King Rat lookalike only had to be spotted somewhere for republicans to go to ground for three weeks.\"</p> <p>Later, his high profile, hard-line stance in support of the Drumcree Orangemen in their quest to march down Portadown's mainly nationalist Garvaghy Road led to a meeting with Ulster Unionist leader, David Trimble, and Democratic Unionist Willie McCrea appeared alongside him at a protest rally when he was expelled from the UVF. Republicans condemn him as a fanatic, out to exterminate anyone opposed to his cause. But many loyalists, for whom he remains an icon, his image tattooed on countless chests, insist he did not hate Roman Catholics, only republicans.</p> <p>Controversy dogged his life and death and questions continue to haunt his pensioner father, an articulate, courteous man with no paramilitary connections, who will never be shaken from his belief that the state conspired to get rid of his son because he was a \"problem\" to the peace process.</p> <p>Why were three members of the INLA, among the LVF's most deadly enemies, housed in the same block, albeit in separate wings? How did they know Wright would be in the prison yard that morning, waiting in a van to be taken to the visiting area?</p> <p>How did they manage to smuggle guns into one of Europe's most secure jails, cut a 2ft by 2ft hole in the fence, and squeeze through it undetected by prison guards?</p> <p>Why was a crucial video camera not working and a security guard inexplicably called away from an overlooking watchtower in the vital moments before Christopher \"Crip\" McWilliams pumped seven bullets into Wright?</p> <p>Even after Wright's death, the killing went on. A total of 10 people died in an orgy of tit-for-tat violence in the following few weeks.</p> <p>\"Two wrongs don't make a right,\" said his father. \"I never slept for months. I just prayed, 'Please God, make it stop'.\"</p> <p>Three years later, the peace process more secure even if the political institutions are still under serious strain, David Wright is still searching for answers.</p> <p>How did a boy from a respectable family and with \"a brain well above street level\", as his father puts it, end up one of the country's most notorious paramilitaries?</p> <p>Wright was born in 1960, in Wolverhampton, where his father was working at the time, the only son and middle child amongfour girls. His mother left when the family was young, and Billy, like his sisters, moved back to Northern Ireland while his father stayed in England.</p> <p>He was brought up first in a children's home near the border in south Armagh and later by an aunt in Portadown.</p> <p>As he approached adulthood in the early 1970s, IRA violence was at its height, and at the age of 15 he had already joined the junior UVF and served a term in Belfast's Crumlin Road jail.</p> <p>\"He was very much affected by the republican massacre of 10 Protestant workmen at Kingsmills in 1976 and it was around this time that he was heavily indoctrinated by UVF godfathers in Portadown,\" explained one source.</p> <p>\"We didn't see eye to eye - what parent and teenager do?\" admitted his father. \"But I didn't know then of his UVF involvement. I've never had so much as a parking ticket in my life and the only club I ever belonged to was a catalogue club where you paid a few bob a week for a pair of trousers. He was clever and well-read. Theology, Irish history, you name it, he could talk about it. He could have taken any route he wished. But he didn't want to travel. Everything was foreign to him except here.\"</p> <p>When David finally moved back to Portadown because his father was dying, Billy was married and had a steady job as an insurance salesman. He had two daughters and had taken in his sister's son when she moved to America after the break-up of a relationship. He had also found religion. \"At the time, he didn't drink, smoke or gamble. I knew very little about his social life but I thought he had put prison and all that behind him,\" said David, who steadfastly refuses to believe security source allegations that his son had anything to do with drug dealing.</p> <p>\"We saw each other pretty much every Sunday morning,\" said David. \"I buy the odd painting and Billy would always say 'Any waffle [gossip]? You'll buy a good one one day'.\"</p> <p>Another acquaintance said: \"Billy had an amazing ability to compartmentalise his life. On the one hand there was his paramilitary involvement, on the other his family. He was a good father and nothing, but nothing, interfered with the time he spent with his children.\"</p> <p>The father-son relationship was much improved from when Billy was a teenager, but David was aware of his strong views and could not ignore the knowledge that he was the local UVF commander in an area where that organisation was particularly active. Reaching for another of the heavy-duty cigarettes he smokes constantly, he insisted these activities were never discussed.</p> <p><b> Police</b><br></p> <p>\"I never asked and Billy never talked about it,\" he said, then adding almost as an afterthought. \"He was the CO of mid-Ulster UVF, not the Boy Scout movement. Billy was my son, but he was a man, he made his own choices, not mine.\"</p> <p>But then he was at pains to point out that he was at home with Billy when the police burst in only to be radioed with news of a particularly vicious triple killing at a mobile shop near Lurgan that Wright was alleged to have been behind.</p> <p>\"So, you see, he couldn't have done it, I was with him, \" he says, almost triumphantly.

      "bodyText": "Billy \"King Rat\" Wright struck terror into the heart of mid-Ulster as one of Northern Ireland's most ruthless loyalist paramilitaries. Now, three years after republicans gunned him down in a high security jail, his father, David, ironically finds himself in a similar position to several nationalist families, battling for inquiries into murders they suspect the state might have played a part in. The government has admitted there were serious security lapses in the Maze prison on the day Wright was killed, but strenuously denied there was collusion. Lagan Valley Ulster Unionist MP Jeffrey Donaldson has also called for an immediate inquiry into thekilling. He said: \"The murder of Billy Wright had the potential to up-end the entire peace process. It is essential something like this never happens again inside a prison. \"We need answers to many unresolved questions, both so that the Wright family can learn the truth and so the public interest can be served. There should be an independent inquiry \"My interest in this issue is not in terms of an interest in paramilitarism but I am concerned about the circumstances of this murder in the Maze, in my constituency.\" Wright's father has vowed to fight for answers to his questions: \"I will not rest until I get a full inquiry into the death of my son. He was murdered while under the care of the state.\" On one wall of the neat living room in David Wright's tiny, red-brick terrace house is a faded, framed newspaper article about his father Billy's shoe shop and antique business, which begins: \"The name of Wright is one that holds an honoured tradition in Portadown.\" From another wall, a colour photograph of a tough-looking, intense, young man with close-cropped hair and a checked shirt, stares down. This young man, named Billy after his grandfather, was also well known in mid-Ulster, although infamous would be a better description. Sentence Billy Wright was shot dead by the Irish National Liberation Army in the Maze on December 271997 where he was serving an eight-year sentence for threatening to kill a woman. Security sources claim that Wright, 37, once the local Ulster Volunteer Force leader and later boss of the breakaway Loyalist Volunteer faction, was behind up to 20 brutal murders, although he was never convicted of any. \"He put the fear of God into people,\" said one man. \"There is no doubt that as a UVF leader he was blooded in violence but it is difficult to separate the myth from the reality. A King Rat lookalike only had to be spotted somewhere for republicans to go to ground for three weeks.\" Later, his high profile, hard-line stance in support of the Drumcree Orangemen in their quest to march down Portadown's mainly nationalist Garvaghy Road led to a meeting with Ulster Unionist leader, David Trimble, and Democratic Unionist Willie McCrea appeared alongside him at a protest rally when he was expelled from the UVF. Republicans condemn him as a fanatic, out to exterminate anyone opposed to his cause. But many loyalists, for whom he remains an icon, his image tattooed on countless chests, insist he did not hate Roman Catholics, only republicans. Controversy dogged his life and death and questions continue to haunt his pensioner father, an articulate, courteous man with no paramilitary connections, who will never be shaken from his belief that the state conspired to get rid of his son because he was a \"problem\" to the peace process. Why were three members of the INLA, among the LVF's most deadly enemies, housed in the same block, albeit in separate wings? How did they know Wright would be in the prison yard that morning, waiting in a van to be taken to the visiting area? How did they manage to smuggle guns into one of Europe's most secure jails, cut a 2ft by 2ft hole in the fence, and squeeze through it undetected by prison guards? Why was a crucial video camera not working and a security guard inexplicably called away from an overlooking watchtower in the vital moments before Christopher \"Crip\" McWilliams pumped seven bullets into Wright? Even after Wright's death, the killing went on. A total of 10 people died in an orgy of tit-for-tat violence in the following few weeks. \"Two wrongs don't make a right,\" said his father. \"I never slept for months. I just prayed, 'Please God, make it stop'.\" Three years later, the peace process more secure even if the political institutions are still under serious strain, David Wright is still searching for answers. How did a boy from a respectable family and with \"a brain well above street level\", as his father puts it, end up one of the country's most notorious paramilitaries? Wright was born in 1960, in Wolverhampton, where his father was working at the time, the only son and middle child amongfour girls. His mother left when the family was young, and Billy, like his sisters, moved back to Northern Ireland while his father stayed in England. He was brought up first in a children's home near the border in south Armagh and later by an aunt in Portadown. As he approached adulthood in the early 1970s, IRA violence was at its height, and at the age of 15 he had already joined the junior UVF and served a term in Belfast's Crumlin Road jail. \"He was very much affected by the republican massacre of 10 Protestant workmen at Kingsmills in 1976 and it was around this time that he was heavily indoctrinated by UVF godfathers in Portadown,\" explained one source. \"We didn't see eye to eye - what parent and teenager do?\" admitted his father. \"But I didn't know then of his UVF involvement. I've never had so much as a parking ticket in my life and the only club I ever belonged to was a catalogue club where you paid a few bob a week for a pair of trousers. He was clever and well-read. Theology, Irish history, you name it, he could talk about it. He could have taken any route he wished. But he didn't want to travel. Everything was foreign to him except here.\" When David finally moved back to Portadown because his father was dying, Billy was married and had a steady job as an insurance salesman. He had two daughters and had taken in his sister's son when she moved to America after the break-up of a relationship. He had also found religion. \"At the time, he didn't drink, smoke or gamble. I knew very little about his social life but I thought he had put prison and all that behind him,\" said David, who steadfastly refuses to believe security source allegations that his son had anything to do with drug dealing. \"We saw each other pretty much every Sunday morning,\" said David. \"I buy the odd painting and Billy would always say 'Any waffle [gossip]? You'll buy a good one one day'.\" Another acquaintance said: \"Billy had an amazing ability to compartmentalise his life. On the one hand there was his paramilitary involvement, on the other his family. He was a good father and nothing, but nothing, interfered with the time he spent with his children.\" The father-son relationship was much improved from when Billy was a teenager, but David was aware of his strong views and could not ignore the knowledge that he was the local UVF commander in an area where that organisation was particularly active. Reaching for another of the heavy-duty cigarettes he smokes constantly, he insisted these activities were never discussed. Police \"I never asked and Billy never talked about it,\" he said, then adding almost as an afterthought. \"He was the CO of mid-Ulster UVF, not the Boy Scout movement. Billy was my son, but he was a man, he made his own choices, not mine.\" But then he was at pains to point out that he was at home with Billy when the police burst in only to be radioed with news of a particularly vicious triple killing at a mobile shop near Lurgan that Wright was alleged to have been behind. \"So, you see, he couldn't have done it, I was with him, \" he says, almost triumphantly. He also insisted that Billy denied outright killing Catholic taxi driver Michael McGoldrick, the crime for which he was expelled from the UVF,. David has tried to understand the anger that came from the murders of three close relatives at the hands of the IRA - that of his own cousin Jim, an RUC man who played in the Salvation Army band, and Billy's wife Thelma's father and brother, Billy and Leslie Corrigan. He believes the government and security forces failed people, paramilitaries like his son and law-abiding citizens such as himself alike, but shook his head as he voiced his own view that terrorism was unacceptable in a democracy. He is sanguine about the fact many people have no sympathy for him because of what his son was and the crimes he committed, but he is clear that what legitimises his call for an inquiry is that Wright was killed while he was in the care of the state. \"When Billy was shot I got hate mail and sympathy cards in equal measure,\" he said. \"I got cards from people like Johnny Adair and Michael Stone but I have nothing to say to them. And the people who hate my son for what he's supposed to have done, I can't change their minds. If he had been shot in the street, I would grieve but that would be it. But this way, no.\" It might seem strange that he is now on same side as many Catholics who have suffered at hands of terrorists such as his son and that he supports calls for inquiries by those - such as the families of lawyers, Pat Finucane and Rosemary Nelson - who believe security forces may have co-operated with loyalists to kill their relatives. And, in another odd twist, he has long been friends and shared a drink with the older generation of Hamills, family of Robert, a young nationalist kicked to death by a loyalist mob in Portadown - while, it is alleged, police stood by without intervening. \"All those people have every right to know exactly what happened to their loved ones,\" he insisted. \"You can't share grief but you know what it is.\" He admitted he has grown obsessed with his son's murder and the quest for the truth has led to an encyclopaedic knowledge of the details of the case.

      "body": "<p>Discoveries that open a new window on the prehistory of ancient Egypt have been made by British archaeologists who have found 30 sites rich in art chiselled into rocks up to 6,000 years ago in the desert east of the Nile. </p> <p>The rock drawings show cattle, boats, ostriches, giraffes, hippos and the men and women who lived in the area in 4,000BC, long before the first pharaohs, or the first pyramids. </p> <p>\"It's the Sistine Chapel of predynastic Egypt. It's amazing,\" said Toby Wilkinson, of Christ's College, Cambridge, who led the Eastern Desert Survey this month. \"What this does is open up a completely new chapter in the study of Egyptian civilisation and its origins.\" </p> <p>Ancient Egypt was always a puzzle. The civilisation appeared to archaeologists to have sprung up as a succession of dynasties of master-builders along a ribbon of fertile land on either side of the river Nile. </p> <p>Even to the ancient Greeks, the Sphinx and the pyramids seemed to have always been there. The challenge has been to identify the origins of settlement on the Nile. </p> <p>Egyptologists now think that the forefathers of the pyramid builders could be the same people who left their signatures on stones in the desert 6,000 years ago. </p> <p>\"Some of it is quite breathtaking,\" Dr Wilkinson said. \"It is very difficult to date precisely, but looking at the stylistic parallels, a lot of this art has got to be from around 4,000BC. That is pretty old - and some of it is even older. </p> <p>\"Looking at the striking similarities between the rock art pictures and the painted pottery from the same period in the Nile valley, it is pretty clear that the same people were producing both.\" </p> <p>In the 1930s, a German scientist began examining evidence of ancient human activity in the desert between the Nile and the Red sea, but the second world war interrupted the work. The origins of Egyptian civilisation began to emerge as a hot academic topic in the 1970s. More recently, British teams began to look systematically at the eastern desert. </p> <p>\"Until the last two or three years, people had been looking entirely in the Nile valley, and people had never really considered that there might be a vast treasurehouse of information out there in what is now desert, because it is so inhospitable and inaccessible today,\" Dr Wilkinson said. </p> <p>\"People hadn't stopped to think that it might have been rather different thousands of years ago.\" </p> <p>Egypt began to turn to desert in about 3,500BC. Until then, the landscape would have been much like the present east African savannah, with waterholes and seasonal rivers, and with much the same fauna. </p> <p>Dr Wilkinson and his colleagues - some of them amateurs who joined the team as part of an adventure holiday to finance the research - began exploring a section of desert between two major roads, the Wadi Hammamat and the Wadi Barramiya. </p> <p>\"Pretty much everywhere we have looked we found a plethora of rock art sites,\" he said. \"A couple of weeks ago, we found more than 30 new sites that had never been recorded or mentioned before. </p> <p>\"Sites can vary in size from a boulder with a few animals or boats pecked on it to a vast area of cliff face dotted with pictures of people and animals, hunting scenes, flotillas of boats and giraffes, ostriches and elephants.\" </p> <p>Wadis are ancient riverbeds that now serve as channels for periodic flash floods, and ancient travellers would have stayed close to them. About 20 of the new rock sites are at a wadi called Umm Salam. Some bear the graffiti of generations. </p> <p>The team found evidence of Bedouin, Roman and Greek markings, and of travellers who went that way in the era of the pharaohs. But the most dramatic were pictures that told a story of an unknown pastoral people, driving their cattle from one watering place to another, between the Nile valley and the Red sea. </p> <p>Some of the boats chiselled into the rocks are fairly simple. Some seem to have religious significance. They show figures with large plumes in their hair, like the later gods of Egypt. Some of the boats are being dragged - an image that recurs in the tombs in the Valley of the Kings. Some of the figures depicted are clearly chiefs, wearing what might be ostrich feathers. </p> <p>There has always been evidence of prehistoric commercial traffic in the region. Coral, sea shells and obsidian - a black volcanic glass - came to the Nile from the Red sea. But the picture that emerges is of an indigenous nomadic people, moving from place to place according to season with their cattle, who may have been forced to settle as the land around them began to parch. </p> <p>\"There is a lovely little scene of seven women dancing, holding hands,\" Dr Wilkinson said. \"They seem to have skirts on, but in general the figures are quite rudimentary. We think of Egypt today as just a narrow strip on either side of the Nile valley. We are going to have to rethink our idea of the extent of Egypt, 7,000 or 6,000 years ago. It wasn't just the Nile valley, it was this vast area on either side which was able to support life. </p> <p>\"These people moved out of the savannahs into the Nile valley and settled there, and this is what kickstarted Egyptian civilisation.\" </p> <p><strong>Countdown to civilisation</strong></p> <p><strong> 8,000 BC</strong> First clay tokens used to record livestock and grain in Mesopotamia </p> <p><strong> 7,000 BC</strong> First mortar used with sun-dried brick in Jericho; cloth is woven in Turkey </p> <p><strong> 6,000 BC</strong> Wheat grown for bread in south-west Asia </p> <p><strong> 5,000 BC</strong> The horse is domesticated in Ukraine </p> <p><strong> 4,000 BC</strong> The Sumerians build Ur in Mesopotamia </p> <p><strong> 3,500 BC</strong> Minoan civilisation begins in Crete, and the first hieroglyphs are used in Egypt </p> <p><strong> 3,000 BC</strong> The Babylonians predict eclipses </p> <p><strong> 2,700 BC</strong> The Great Pyramid of Giza is built for the pharaoh Cheops </p> <p><strong> 500 BC</strong> Athenian civilisation begins</p>",

      "bodyText": "Discoveries that open a new window on the prehistory of ancient Egypt have been made by British archaeologists who have found 30 sites rich in art chiselled into rocks up to 6,000 years ago in the desert east of the Nile. The rock drawings show cattle, boats, ostriches, giraffes, hippos and the men and women who lived in the area in 4,000BC, long before the first pharaohs, or the first pyramids. \"It's the Sistine Chapel of predynastic Egypt. It's amazing,\" said Toby Wilkinson, of Christ's College, Cambridge, who led the Eastern Desert Survey this month. \"What this does is open up a completely new chapter in the study of Egyptian civilisation and its origins.\" Ancient Egypt was always a puzzle. The civilisation appeared to archaeologists to have sprung up as a succession of dynasties of master-builders along a ribbon of fertile land on either side of the river Nile. Even to the ancient Greeks, the Sphinx and the pyramids seemed to have always been there. The challenge has been to identify the origins of settlement on the Nile. Egyptologists now think that the forefathers of the pyramid builders could be the same people who left their signatures on stones in the desert 6,000 years ago. \"Some of it is quite breathtaking,\" Dr Wilkinson said. \"It is very difficult to date precisely, but looking at the stylistic parallels, a lot of this art has got to be from around 4,000BC. That is pretty old - and some of it is even older. \"Looking at the striking similarities between the rock art pictures and the painted pottery from the same period in the Nile valley, it is pretty clear that the same people were producing both.\" In the 1930s, a German scientist began examining evidence of ancient human activity in the desert between the Nile and the Red sea, but the second world war interrupted the work. The origins of Egyptian civilisation began to emerge as a hot academic topic in the 1970s. More recently, British teams began to look systematically at the eastern desert. \"Until the last two or three years, people had been looking entirely in the Nile valley, and people had never really considered that there might be a vast treasurehouse of information out there in what is now desert, because it is so inhospitable and inaccessible today,\" Dr Wilkinson said. \"People hadn't stopped to think that it might have been rather different thousands of years ago.\" Egypt began to turn to desert in about 3,500BC. Until then, the landscape would have been much like the present east African savannah, with waterholes and seasonal rivers, and with much the same fauna. Dr Wilkinson and his colleagues - some of them amateurs who joined the team as part of an adventure holiday to finance the research - began exploring a section of desert between two major roads, the Wadi Hammamat and the Wadi Barramiya. \"Pretty much everywhere we have looked we found a plethora of rock art sites,\" he said. \"A couple of weeks ago, we found more than 30 new sites that had never been recorded or mentioned before. \"Sites can vary in size from a boulder with a few animals or boats pecked on it to a vast area of cliff face dotted with pictures of people and animals, hunting scenes, flotillas of boats and giraffes, ostriches and elephants.\" Wadis are ancient riverbeds that now serve as channels for periodic flash floods, and ancient travellers would have stayed close to them. About 20 of the new rock sites are at a wadi called Umm Salam. Some bear the graffiti of generations. The team found evidence of Bedouin, Roman and Greek markings, and of travellers who went that way in the era of the pharaohs. But the most dramatic were pictures that told a story of an unknown pastoral people, driving their cattle from one watering place to another, between the Nile valley and the Red sea. Some of the boats chiselled into the rocks are fairly simple. Some seem to have religious significance. They show figures with large plumes in their hair, like the later gods of Egypt. Some of the boats are being dragged - an image that recurs in the tombs in the Valley of the Kings. Some of the figures depicted are clearly chiefs, wearing what might be ostrich feathers. There has always been evidence of prehistoric commercial traffic in the region. Coral, sea shells and obsidian - a black volcanic glass - came to the Nile from the Red sea. But the picture that emerges is of an indigenous nomadic people, moving from place to place according to season with their cattle, who may have been forced to settle as the land around them began to parch. \"There is a lovely little scene of seven women dancing, holding hands,\" Dr Wilkinson said. \"They seem to have skirts on, but in general the figures are quite rudimentary. We think of Egypt today as just a narrow strip on either side of the Nile valley. We are going to have to rethink our idea of the extent of Egypt, 7,000 or 6,000 years ago. It wasn't just the Nile valley, it was this vast area on either side which was able to support life. \"These people moved out of the savannahs into the Nile valley and settled there, and this is what kickstarted Egyptian civilisation.\" Countdown to civilisation 8,000 BC First clay tokens used to record livestock and grain in Mesopotamia 7,000 BC First mortar used with sun-dried brick in Jericho; cloth is woven in Turkey 6,000 BC Wheat grown for bread in south-west Asia 5,000 BC The horse is domesticated in Ukraine 4,000 BC The Sumerians build Ur in Mesopotamia 3,500 BC Minoan civilisation begins in Crete, and the first hieroglyphs are used in Egypt 3,000 BC The Babylonians predict eclipses 2,700 BC The Great Pyramid of Giza is built for the pharaoh Cheops 500 BC Athenian civilisation begins",

Fear that the blasts aimed at churches and priests would provoke revenge attacks when the majority Muslim population began celebrating the end of Ramadan yesterday proved groundless. But millions of people ignored their religious leaders' calls for quiet celebrations and held huge noisy parties. Against rising speculation about who was responsible for the 15 explosions, mostly within 30 minutes, in nine cities in Java and Sumatra, Vice-President Megawati Sukarnoputri said the motive was political, not religious. A caretaker at the Catholic church of St John the Evangelist in Kudus, 150 miles south-east of Jakarta, returned from a short lunch break yesterday to find the vestry alight. He managed to extinguish the blaze before it caused more damage. \"There's no way this could have been an accident,\" a local church source said. \"It is clearly part of this wider campaign to spread fear through shameful terror.\" The senior security minister, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, said that the police, supported by soldiers, would remain on the highest state of alert until after the New Year's Eve celebrations. At least 14,000 police reinforcements were on the streets of Jakarta yesterday searching everyone entering the main mosques for Eid al-Fitr prayers. In London, the Foreign Office minister John Battle wrote to President Abdurrahman Wahid, saying the people of the UK \"shared your sense of outrage at the [bombings].\" It is widely thought that the perpetrators are trying to discredit and eventually topple Mr Wahid, who has gone on national television to appeal for calm. He has said he will not be bullied by acts of terrorism.

      "bodyText": "The shadow home secretary, Ann Widdecombe, yesterday clashed with a potential rival for the Conservative leadership, David Davis, when she said huge difficulties stood in the way of his plan for 30,000 extra police over eight years. Mr Davis, chairman of the powerful Commons public accounts committee, is seen as a potential rival to Ms Widdecombe for votes from the centre and right of his party if Wiliam Hague steps down after the general election. The intervention by Mr Davis in the crime debate came as the Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir John Stevens, again warned that pressure on resources was leading to police being transferred to white collar desk work. Sir John warned that the Met would be short of 1,000 civilians by February, with the total number of uniformed officers down by 2,500 from six years ago. Officers were being pulled off the beat to answer emergency calls and carry out administrative tasks. \"We have had to take 200 officers off the street to do office duties and deal with things like 999 calls to ensure we provide a proper service, and that really is not on,\" said Sir John. He also appeared to echo some of the criticisms made by Mr Hague of the Macpherson report into the Metropolitan police, which were reignited by the death of 10-year-old Damilola Taylor. \"In any organisation that's been the first in this country to be found guilty of institutionalised racism - whatever that means in the Macpherson test - of course people are going to be bruised,\" Sir John said. Ms Widdecombe said the commissioner's comment \"fully vindicates William Hague's position and it's a terrible indictment of this government's handling of law and order\". However, she also found herself in the unusual position of being outflanked from the right within her own party when Mr Davis called for 30,000 extra police at an extra cost of \u00a32bn per annum by the eighth year, which he said were \"quite small numbers in terms of our overall spending\". Mr Davis described Ms Widdecombe's commitment to restore the 3,000 police officers lost under Labour as the work of a year or two, adding: \"We need to go much further and I think many members of the Conservative party would agree.\" In an implicit criticism of the party leadership, he said the Conservatives were fighting only on the centre ground on crime and it was time to move on. Ms Widdecombe has so far been only permitted by the shadow chancellor, Michael Portillo, to promise not to cut the budget for the police. She said yesterday the reversal of decline was \"a first step. When you are making a clear commitment to the general public you need to make a commitment you know you can produce and produce quickly. We have never said we shall stop when we have reversed the numbers.\" Ms Widdecombe said that apart from the problem of cost, there was no point setting a numerical target regardless of the quality or the history of recruits. \"No chief constable would support that\", she said. \"There will be huge difficulties in the way, and I will make it my business always to promise only what we can deliver.\"",

Sarah O'Brien, from the Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS) in London, said the health risk was caused by people buying bigger birds than they needed and continuing to serve up turkey for days after Christmas is over. Most casualties fell victim to salmonella or another food bug called Clostridium perfringens. Dr O'Brien said: \"Clostridium tends to be linked with cooling and reheating either meat or gravy. \"If you're continually cooling and reheating things your chance of making someone ill with Clostridium perfringens is quite high.\" Two increases were regularly seen in food poisoning statistics, one in summer - caused by food being left out in warm temperatures - and the other in December. Of the 200 to 300 infection outbreaks associated with poultry reported to the PHLS each year, between 50 and 70 occurred in December, said Dr O'Brien. She said it was very important to leave enough time for a frozen turkey to thaw thoroughly before cooking. The best advice was to follow the supplier's guidelines. \"If you follow the instructions supplied by the supermarket carefully, that should reduce your risk,\" she added. Press Association",

She does not want children to have a right to learn the identity of their biological parents. Such a prospect would deter donors who might reasonably fear they could be pursued by large numbers of unknown offspring seeking emotional or financial support. But the government will consult on a range of options that could allow the children of \"gamete donors\" to build up a picture of the biological parent's characteristics. The least radical option would allow disclosure of non-identifiable information about the donor's background, education, occupation, interests and characteristics such as hair colour. This option is likely to include details of the biological parent's racial background. A second more far reaching option would extend to information that could come closer to identifying the donor, including medical history and family health records. Although this would not be a direct breach of anonymity, it might provide clues that could allow the child to track down a biological parent. A third option will be to give the donor an opportunity to choose to provide a name and address at the time the donation is made that would be available to the child on request. More than 11,000 children have been born by donor insemination since 1991 when the human fertilisation and embryology authority was set up to license fertility clinics and keep records of all sperm and egg donors.

The man who died on Christmas Day fell from the undercarriage of a British Airways jet just after it had taken off. On Sunday evening, farm workers found the body of another man in a field. He is thought to have fallen from aplane as it came into land. Monday's death was witnessed by an airport worker who saw the man falling after the pilot of the Boeing 777, destined for Cancun, Mexico, raised the landing gear. Gatwick duty manager Michael Ingle said: \"We received a phone call from one of the workers on the ground saying that he had seen an object fall from the plane.

Because the space is so small, the bodies can become jammed and tumble out several days later, dislodged by a bumpy landing or turbulence. On most jets, the only way a flight deck sensor would show a problem was if the undercarriage failed to fully retract, suggesting an object had jammed it. The other body, believed to be of a man aged between 18 and 20, was found on Sunday evening in an 80 acre field at Rudgwick, Surrey. The man, described as white, of Mediterranean appearance with short black hair, is thought to have fallen several thousand feet as the plane he had stowed away on prepared to land. Police said that the body could have been in the field for several days. \"The probability is that he had sought refuge in the main landing gear bay of the plane,\" added a spokesman. \"Unfortunately, it is very unlikely anyone would survive because of the lack of oxygen and freezing temperatures at that altitude, around 35,000 feet.

In October 1996, a couple in a pub garden spotted a body falling from a DC9 over Richmond, south-west London, as it approached Heathrow. Vijay Saini, 19, fell 2,000 feet from the jet and was discovered three days later. A post mortem revealed that he was dead when he tumbled from the plane.

      "bodyText": "Reformers have won a landslide victory in Serbia, giving them a strong mandate to deal with the collapsed economy and tackle corrupt state machinery. \"This is the most convincing victory in the history of the Serbian parliament and will be hard to repeat,\" said Cedomir Jovanovic, senior aide to the prime minister-designate, Zoran Djindjic. Although the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS) coalition government led by Mr Djindjic is now on track to win 176 seats in the 250-seat parliament - the Socialist party has just 37 - it must satisfy high expectations and address complex problems. The Serbian Unity party founded by the murdered paramilitary Zeljko Raznatovic, known as Arkan, captured 14 seats, shocking analysts. Topping the political agenda is the role of Kosovo and Montenegro in the Yugoslavian federation, and the infiltration of Albanian separatists in southern Serbia. Montenegro wants its own seat at the United Nations, external recognition of its government, and then talks on some kind of alliance with Belgrade. On the social and economic front, the immediate concern is the lack of electricity. The day after Serbia went to the polls, prolonged power cuts plunged homes and factories into darkness for up to eight hours. The new government's other priorities, Mr Jovanovic said, were rapid social reform, and legislation to define the principal responsibility of \"politicians who are in power now or who recently held power\". Two top military allies of the former president Slobodan Milosevic - General Milorad Obradovic and Admiral Milan Zec - were sacked yesterday. Both were linked to the aggressive Milosevic policy in Montenegro, which many feared would lead to war. By dismissing them, DOS leaders aim to appease the pro-independence president of Montenegro, Milo Djukanovic. They have also sought to ease tension in Montenegro by promising to disband a reviled special military police unit. Although many fear that the new Serbian regime may be as corrupt as the last, the wheels of justice have begun to turn against Mr Milosevic. At the weekend Mr Djindjic said that he expected an investigation of the former president to begin next month. A Centre for Policy Studies survey found that 32% of people wanted Mr Milosevic tried for election fraud and corruption, and 41% wanted him tried for war crimes as well. The time available to solve such long-term problems is limited, and some fear that the long-standing rivalry between President Vojislav Kostunica and Mr Djindjic may burst into the open now that the elections are over. Mr Djindjic wants rapid reform and a far-reaching purge of the Milosevic \"kleptocracy\", while Mr Kostunica is seeking a more gradual approach. Many predict such pressures could split the coalition within six to eight months. Projected results based on 98% of votes counted: Democratic Opposition of Serbia (Vojislav Kostunica) Seats: 176 (64% of vote) Socialist Party of Serbia (Slobodan Milosevic) Seats: 37 (14% of vote) Serbian Radical party (Rightwing party) Seats: 23 (9% of vote) Party of Serbian Unity (Extreme-right party of Arkan) Seats: 14 (5% of vote)",

      "bodyText": "A new law limiting the length of time suspects can be held without trial has forced France to release from jail a woman suspected of being a leading accomplice of the convicted terrorist Carlos the Jackal. Judicial sources said that Christa-Margot Frohlich, imprisoned in 1996 after extradition from Italy, was freed last week under the law, which comes into force on January 1. It says suspects cannot be held for longer than four years without facing trial. She must report regularly to the police and, according to her lawyers, has promised not to try to leave the country - the overriding fear of France's leading anti-terrorist magistrate, Jean-Louis Brugui\u00e8re, who has warned that Germany never extradites its citizens. Ms Frohlich, 58, a schoolteacher from Hanover who became a member of the Red Army Faction and West Germany's notorious Revolutionary Cells, is accused of murder and taking part in an attack by explosives resulting in deaths. She is accused of playing a key role in a April 1982 car bomb attack outside a restaurant in the Rue Marboeuf, Paris, which killed a pregnant passerby and injured 63 more people, 10 of them seriously. Investigators also believe it was she who planted the explosives that blew up a Paris-Toulouse express train the previous month, leaving five dead and 30 injured. The orders for both attacks were given by Carlos, the terrorist born Ilich Ramirez Sanchez in Venezuela, because he was peeved at the French authorities for arresting his wife, Magdalena Kopp, in February that year. Carlos, now a portly 50, is blamed for more than 80 deaths and hundreds of injuries during a spectacular career in the 1970s and 80s. He is serving a 50-year sentence at Paris's forbidding La Sant\u00e9 prison for murdering two French policemen and their Lebanese informant in 1975. In the two-month run-up to his wife's trial, scheduled for April 15 1982, Carlos embarked on a bloody bombing and shooting spree to persuade the French authorities to release her.",

French newspapers reported that Mr Mitterrand, 54, had told the police that \u00a3500,000 of the money belonged to him and had been temporarily placed in a Brenco account, while the rest represented \"consultancy fees\" paid to him by Brenco. According to the sources he said that at the beginning of the 1990s he advised Mr Falcone to open talks with the Angolan ruling party, the MPLA, and its leader, Jose Eduardo Dos Santos, who became president in 1992. Thanks to this advise, Mr Falcone arranged loans - including one from the French bank Paribas, now part of BNP Paribas - for the Angolan regime, guaranteed by income from future oil production. The police suspect that the money paid for Russian tanks, helicopters and MiG fighters, worth more than \u00a3345m which Brenco Trading allegedly sold illicitly to Luanda in 1993 and 1994, when the regime appeared to be losing ground to Jonas Savimbi's Unita forces. Mr Mitterrand, a former Africa correspondent for Agence France-Presse, joined his father's Elys\u00e9e Palace staff in 1984 and headed the president's so-called \"Africa cell\" from 1986 to 1992, handling the highly complex relations between France and the leaders of its former colonies. Other leading figures allegedly involved in the scandal are the former interior minister Charles Pasqua, a former senior civil servant, Jean-Charles Marchiani, and a former director of the state arms export company, Bernard Poussier. Of Mr Mitterand's two main alleged associates, Mr Falcone was jailed on December 1and an arrest warrant has been issued for Russian-born businessman Arkadi Gaidamak. Mr Gaidamak rose to prominence in France by helping to negotiate the release of two French pilots shot down by Bosnian Serbs in 1995. He also holds the French record for unpaid taxes - about \u00a350m. Simon Taylor of the British organisation Global Witness, which published a report earlier this year on illicit arms deals and the civil war in Angola, said that two Brenco International subsidiaries had taken over most of the work of procuring weapons, equipment and food for the Angolan army. \"Far from being simply another French corruption scandal, the real story is wide-reaching and involves oil companies, offshore financial centres, international banks and highest-level French and Angolan officials,\" he said. Kickbacks and rake-offs in Angola now rivalled the scale of state robbery in Abacha's Nigeria and Mobutu's Zaire, he added.",

Quite a trick if you can manage it. \u0095 Adrian Barker is a senior best value consultant for the Improvement and Development Agency (IDeA)",

Over more than half a century, his name was synonymous with a certain style of Scottish music and with a nostalgic image of Scotland which has proved eminently marketable around the world. </p> <p>His recordings sold by the million and, from the 1940s to the 1970s, the name of Jimmy Shand and his Band would fill halls throughout the United Kingdom as well as in any centre of the Scottish diaspora, New York's Carnegie Hall included. In 1955, his Bluebell Polka was one of the most unlikely top 20 entrants of even that eclectic musical era. </p> <p>Shand remained a most unlikely figure of show business celebrity. While the band, led by his own button-key accordion, produced music to set even the most reluctant toes tapping, their stage appearance often bordered on the funereal. Shand would allow himself little more than a shy grin and a few words. His was really a band for dancing to, and it was his strict sense of timing, as well as his technical skill, that set him apart. Phil Cunningham, one of the most innovative of present-day Scottish accordion players, described him as \"a human metronome\". </p> <p>Shand's contribution to popularising Scottish music was immense, although it also did much to channel perceptions of it into a particular style. There is a contradiction between the free-flowing ceilidh tradition and strict tempo dance music. Shand had thousands of superb imitators - tartan jackets and all - but few, until recently, broke out of the limiting format of two accordions, piano, fiddle, double-bass and drums; the stereotype was reinforced by BBC television's White Heather Club series of the 1960s, built around him. </p> <p>Like many talented and successful Scots, Shand came from a mining background. He was born at East Wemyss, in Fife, left school at 14 and went straight into the local pit. Conditions were terrible, and the 1926 general strike brought his career as a miner to an end. He spoke movingly in later life of his decision not to go back down the pit, though his bond with the mining communities of Fife remained extremely strong. </p> <p>Since childhood, he had been picking up tunes on his father's melodeon, a close relative of the button-key accordion. When he visited a music shop in Dundee, the owner gave him a job as a salesman. He thus got to know which of the better-off families bought sheet music, and sought out their houses so that he could listen to them playing and add to his knowledge. </p> <p>In 1933, he made his first record, and by the following year was broadcasting for the BBC Scottish Home Service. His reputation grew steadily, but it was only after the war that he put together the Jimmy Shand Band. </p> <p>The former Labour MP, Willie MacKelvey, recalls that his father was the \"second box\" player. The MacKelveys lived in a spacious new council house in Dundee, which, because it accommodated a piano, became the practice place as the band prepared for an increasingly hectic schedule of one-night stands, television appearances and overseas tours. The neighbours would hang out of their windows to listen. </p> <p>Whenever possible, Shand would head back home to Auchtermuchty, in Fife, after gigs - sometimes from as far away as the south of England. He had been a motorcycle racer in his youth and retained a love of fast vehicles and white-knuckle driving. Otherwise, his lifestyle was modest. Whatever international hotel they might be in, he would famously order for the band: \"Sausage, egg and chips for six\". </p> <p>In retirement, honours were showered upon him, culminating in a knighthood last year. There was never any sign of this affecting Shand. He was a shrewd, dignified, Scottish gentleman whose greatest ambition was to be at home in Auchtermuchty among his own people. </p> <p>He is survived by his wife Anne, whom he married in 1936, and their two sons. </p> <p> James Shand, accordionist and bandleader, born January 28 1908; died December 23 2000</p>",
