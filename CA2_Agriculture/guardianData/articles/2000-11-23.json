      "body": "<p>Emil Zatopek, who has died aged 78, was one of the outstanding athletes of the 20th century. In the years following the second world war, he lifted distance running to a new plane, dominating the discipline to a degree achieved only by Paavo Nurmi before him, while at the same time enjoying the awe, respect and affection of his opponents and a popular acclaim that has rarely been matched. </p> <p>From the week he won his first Olympic title in London in 1948 till his last major race in Melbourne in 1956, he was the most instantly recognisable figure in world sport, sending the back-page colour writers deep into their simile banks as they struggled to describe his tortured running style. He ran \"like a man who had been stabbed in the heart\", \"as if his next step would be his last\", \"like a man wrestling with an octopus on a conveyor belt\". Yet when the races were won and the head stopped rolling, a very different Zatopek emerged - a relaxed, gregarious figure with a captivating boyish smile, an aptitude for languages and an infectious enthusiasm for his sport. </p> <p>And he sealed his place in history over eight unforgettable days at the Helsinki Olympic Games of 1952, when he achieved the unprecedented (and since unequalled) feat of winning gold medals in all three classic tests of endurance running - the 5,000 metres, the 10,000 metres and the marathon. </p> <p>Zatopek was born in Koprivnice, in Moravia, the son of a Czech carpenter who had little interest in the boy's passion for running. Away from home, too, the occupying Nazi authorities positively discouraged organised sport; but running tracks were not closed, and in the early 1940s in the town of Zlin, where he worked in the Bata shoe factory, the young Zatopek began to progress slowly in the 1,500 metres. </p> <p>Soon after the end of the war, by now drafted into the Czechoslovak army, he watched the great Swedish miler Arne Andersson compete in an invitation race in Prague. Andersson's physical condition, and an insight into the Swede's heavy background training, revolutionised Zatopek's own running. He had already trained long; now he trained hard. </p> <p>He stretched his body and stamina to the limits: on sentry duty he might spend an hour running on the spot, knees high, shoulders straight; in winter, when saner athletes gratefully took time off from training, he would put on heavy baseball shoes, or even army boots, and run through the snow-covered forests, sometimes bounding in long, looping strides for two or three minutes at a stretch. </p> <p>It was a self-taught and self-imposed regime, which took no account of the niceties of style. But the hours of relentless self-punishment gave him the capacity for sustained speed and the priceless bonus of a reserve tank of energy that would eventually allow him to run flat out for a lap, even at the end of a long, draining race. </p> <p>In 1946 he was selected for the 5,000 metres in the European championships in Oslo, an unspectacular but promising debut on the big stage which saw him take fifth place behind another runner with a celebrated storming finish, Britain's Sydney Wooderson. </p> <p>Two years later, in the build-up to the London Olympic Games of 1948, Zatopek's capacity for consistent, high-speed lapping had brought him noteworthy times in a number of invitation races, but the first track final of the Games, the 10,000 metres, was considered the bailiwick of the Finns (they had won five of the last six Olympic finals), and in particular of Viljo Heino, the current world record holder. </p> <p>No one, certainly not Heino, had been prepared for Zatopek. He took over the lead from the Finn in the 10th of the 25 laps, and five circuits later unleashed a spurt that took him 10 metres clear. Heino simply ground to a halt. Zatopek ran on, unchallenged, as if the devil were at his heels, shoulders hunched, head rolling, face contorted in apparent agony, to the insistent chant of \"Zat-o-pek, Zat-o-pek, Zat-o-pek\" from his compatriots in the crowd, and won by three-quarters of a lap. It was the first track-and-field gold medal ever won by Czechoslovakia. </p> <p>Next day he ran the 5,000 metres heats, and lined up for the final two days after that. For 10 laps of the race, through one of London's midsummer downpours, he shared the lead with the Belgian Gaston Reiff and the Dutchman Willem Slijkhuis. Then, either the fatigue finally hit him or he simply lost concentration; he fell hopelessly off the pace and Reiff accelerated for home. On the penultimate bend Reiff was leading by a good 20 metres from Slijkhuis, with Zatopek a further 25 metres back, splashing doggedly through the puddles in Wembley's red cinder track, apparently without a chance. </p> <p>Suddenly he seemed to wake up, and began a frantic last-ditch sprint. Within 150 metres he had gobbled up Slijkhuis, and in the final straight he closed on Reiff, who was alerted to the danger only when the crowd's roar became hysterical. Reiff lunged desperately for the tape and won by a couple of feet; if the race had been 10 metres longer, Zatopek would have beaten him. </p> <p>Czechoslovakia had found a national hero, and life could hardly have been better. A few weeks after the Games he married the national javelin champion Dana Ingrova (who, by the most bizarre of coincidences, had been born on the same day as he had) - a stable and happy partnership which visibly sustained both of them in the public years as sporting celebrities, and by all accounts made life a lot more tolerable when, in later life, they fell foul of the Czechoslovak political system. She survives him: they had no children. </p> <p>For the next three years Zatopek was the undisputed master. From 1949 to 1951 he competed in 69 long-distance races (a schedule that would be simply unthinkable for any elite runner today) and won every one of them. From his first race at 10,000 metres in 1948 to his 38th in 1954 he was unbeaten at the distance. He won the European 10,000 metres championship in Brussels in 1950 by a full lap, and the 5,000 metres by 23 seconds. He broke 18 world records at distances from 5,000 metres to 30 kilometres, and in 1951 he became the first man to run 20 kilometres in under an hour. He was, in short, a phenomenon. </p> <p>Expectations for success at Helsinki in 1952 were naturally high, but the pressures on him mounted as the Games approached. He had run with a virus at a minor domestic meeting six weeks earlier, and became ill; he recovered, but the slow times in his build-up races were worrying. He also had his first serious brush with the communist authorities in Prague, when a young 1,500 metres runner, Stanislav Jungwirth, was dropped from the Czech Olympic team because his father had been jailed for political offences; Zatopek even threatened to pull out of the Games himself unless Jungwirth were reinstated, and the brinkmanship was successful, though hardly an aid to concentration. </p> <p>Then there were reports, which he refused to confirm, that he might be persuaded to run the marathon rather than - or, conceivably, as well as - the 5,000 metres. </p> <p>Furthermore, he was in Finland, the land of Kolehmainen and Nurmi, where for the last 40 years distance running had been meat, drink, mother's milk and a second religion; every step he took would be under the scrutiny of the most knowledgeable athletics audience in the world. </p> <p>On the first Sunday he took the 10,000 metres gold medal more or less as he pleased, shaking off his opponents one by one with his unwavering pace to win by the length of the straight. On the Tuesday he was visibly relaxed, and came close to clowning his way through the 5,000 metres heats, dropping back down the field, cajoling and pacing lesser runners to qualification once the stragglers had been dropped. Two days later the Olympic stadium was full to bursting, with more than 66,000 spectators for the most eagerly awaited single event of the Games, the 5,000 metres final. </p> <p>The pace was fast, and no one had the courage to make a decisive break until, well into the final lap, Zatopek accelerated into the lead. In any race during the previous four years, that would have been decisive: if Zatopek led in the final lap, Zatopek won the race. But after a few strides in front he experienced something that had never happened to him in his career before, and which would have devastated a lesser spirit: with 300 metres to go, three men charged past him - the red-headed Christopher Chataway of Great Britain; the bespectacled Herbert Schade of Germany, who had been widely tipped to win the race; and the French-Algerian Alain Mimoun, who had followed Zatopek home in the 10,000 metres. Zatopek was left floundering in fourth place, seemingly outpaced and out of the medals. </p> <p>On the final bend, Chataway - who was to fall a few strides later - began to tire, Schade moved up to his shoulder, Mimoun pulled out to take them both on the outside... and Zatopek pounced. With 150 metres to go, there were four men abreast on the crown of the bend, and the one in the red vest way out in lane two, his head rolling in agony, was going fastest of all; from that moment there was no question as to who was going to win. </p> <p>Dana clinched the day's second gold medal for the family by throwing an Olympic record in the first round of the javelin to beat a powerful Russian trio into second, third and fourth places, and Emil, joking that a 2-1 score in the family gold count was too close for comfort, confirmed that he would indeed run in the marathon - the first of his life - the following Sunday. </p> <p>The story of the Helsinki marathon has entered legend: how Zatopek introduced himself to the favourite, Jim Peters of Great Britain, at the start, and ran with him for the first hour; how - in a genuine search for information rather than a masterly piece of gamesmanship - he asked Peters if the pace was quick enough and, somewhat to his surprise, received the answer \"No, too slow\"; and how he left Peters and all the other leaders behind him and drew steadily away. As he entered the stadium a full two-and-a-half minutes clear of the field, the expectant buzz exploded into a single welcoming roar, and wave upon wave of cheering rang out across the Helsinki rooftops as he completed the last 300 metres to win his third gold medal in eight momentous days. </p> <p>His career did not end in Helsinki; two years later he regained his European 10,000 metres title in Berne, but in the 5,000 metres he was beaten into third place by an even more hard-bitten, more relentless and infinitely less appealing competitor, the Ukrainian Vladimir Kuts, who was to assume Zatopek's mantle and win both long-distance track events for the Soviet Union at the Melbourne Games in 1956. </p> <p>Zatopek was at Melbourne to defend his marathon title, but he was hardly in the best shape to tackle it: one of his more outlandish training sessions, which involved running while carrying Dana on his shoulders, had resulted in a bad strain that had only just cleared up in time. He was never seriously in medal contention, but he trotted home in sixth place without seeming unduly bothered, only to break out in smiles and handshakes and hugs of congratulation when he realised that the winner was Alain Mimoun, the old adversary he had beaten in so many championships in the past. </p> <p>He retired a national icon and a natural sporting ambassador for Czechoslovakia. He rose steadily to the rank of colonel in the Czech army, gave unstinting advice during coaching visits abroad, and unostentatiously enjoyed the resulting privileges at home. Until 1968 and the Prague Spring, when he publicly welcomed the shift towards democracy promised by the Dubcek regime, and roundly condemned the Soviet response as troops moved into Prague to re-establish communist control. </p> <p>He was expelled from the Communist party and dismissed from the army. He was consigned to a series of manual jobs for various state departments until, after seven years of this ritual humiliation, he was given a desk at the Ministry of Sport, employing his language skills to monitor and translate sports periodicals from the west. </p> <p>Occasionally he was put on display at official receptions for visiting teams, when he would be seized upon by foreign journalists more eager just to shake his hand than to record the guarded answers he was obliged to give them. And towards the end of the 1980s, with the ice beginning to thaw and Zatopek long retired from the ministry, he would once in a while receive grudging permission to accept an invitation to an athletics event abroad. Invariably he would find himself at the centre of a crowd of foreigners who knew the face only from old newspapers or grainy archive film, but who had fallen under the spell of the legend; they would flock round him in unashamed awe, proffering scraps of paper for his autograph, hardly daring to offer a handshake in case it might be refused. It never was. </p> <p>Zatopek's achievements in athletics are indelible, but bare statistics cannot reflect the genuine affection in which he was held by his fellow competitors, men with whom he chatted and joked as he ran them into the ground, men with whom he would willingly and honestly discuss race tactics even if he were due to run against them the next day, men whose insecurities and disappointments he could sympathise with and understand. </p> <p>Late in 1968 another high-achieving record-breaker, the Australian Ron Clarke, left the Mexico City Olympic Games in deepest gloom: he had been the fastest long-distance runner in the world for a decade, yet in two Olympic Games fate, ill-judgment, altitude, or sheer bad luck had conspired against him, and his career was slipping away without a single gold medal to show for it. On his way home he stopped off in Prague to chat things over with his boyhood idol and long-time friend. </p> <p>As they parted Zatopek gave the Australian a small parcel, and not wishing to embarrass his host, Clarke did not unwrap it until he was on the plane.

      "bodyText": "Emil Zatopek, who has died aged 78, was one of the outstanding athletes of the 20th century. In the years following the second world war, he lifted distance running to a new plane, dominating the discipline to a degree achieved only by Paavo Nurmi before him, while at the same time enjoying the awe, respect and affection of his opponents and a popular acclaim that has rarely been matched. From the week he won his first Olympic title in London in 1948 till his last major race in Melbourne in 1956, he was the most instantly recognisable figure in world sport, sending the back-page colour writers deep into their simile banks as they struggled to describe his tortured running style. He ran \"like a man who had been stabbed in the heart\", \"as if his next step would be his last\", \"like a man wrestling with an octopus on a conveyor belt\". Yet when the races were won and the head stopped rolling, a very different Zatopek emerged - a relaxed, gregarious figure with a captivating boyish smile, an aptitude for languages and an infectious enthusiasm for his sport. And he sealed his place in history over eight unforgettable days at the Helsinki Olympic Games of 1952, when he achieved the unprecedented (and since unequalled) feat of winning gold medals in all three classic tests of endurance running - the 5,000 metres, the 10,000 metres and the marathon. Zatopek was born in Koprivnice, in Moravia, the son of a Czech carpenter who had little interest in the boy's passion for running. Away from home, too, the occupying Nazi authorities positively discouraged organised sport; but running tracks were not closed, and in the early 1940s in the town of Zlin, where he worked in the Bata shoe factory, the young Zatopek began to progress slowly in the 1,500 metres. Soon after the end of the war, by now drafted into the Czechoslovak army, he watched the great Swedish miler Arne Andersson compete in an invitation race in Prague. Andersson's physical condition, and an insight into the Swede's heavy background training, revolutionised Zatopek's own running. He had already trained long; now he trained hard. He stretched his body and stamina to the limits: on sentry duty he might spend an hour running on the spot, knees high, shoulders straight; in winter, when saner athletes gratefully took time off from training, he would put on heavy baseball shoes, or even army boots, and run through the snow-covered forests, sometimes bounding in long, looping strides for two or three minutes at a stretch. It was a self-taught and self-imposed regime, which took no account of the niceties of style. But the hours of relentless self-punishment gave him the capacity for sustained speed and the priceless bonus of a reserve tank of energy that would eventually allow him to run flat out for a lap, even at the end of a long, draining race. In 1946 he was selected for the 5,000 metres in the European championships in Oslo, an unspectacular but promising debut on the big stage which saw him take fifth place behind another runner with a celebrated storming finish, Britain's Sydney Wooderson. Two years later, in the build-up to the London Olympic Games of 1948, Zatopek's capacity for consistent, high-speed lapping had brought him noteworthy times in a number of invitation races, but the first track final of the Games, the 10,000 metres, was considered the bailiwick of the Finns (they had won five of the last six Olympic finals), and in particular of Viljo Heino, the current world record holder. No one, certainly not Heino, had been prepared for Zatopek. He took over the lead from the Finn in the 10th of the 25 laps, and five circuits later unleashed a spurt that took him 10 metres clear. Heino simply ground to a halt. Zatopek ran on, unchallenged, as if the devil were at his heels, shoulders hunched, head rolling, face contorted in apparent agony, to the insistent chant of \"Zat-o-pek, Zat-o-pek, Zat-o-pek\" from his compatriots in the crowd, and won by three-quarters of a lap. It was the first track-and-field gold medal ever won by Czechoslovakia. Next day he ran the 5,000 metres heats, and lined up for the final two days after that. For 10 laps of the race, through one of London's midsummer downpours, he shared the lead with the Belgian Gaston Reiff and the Dutchman Willem Slijkhuis. Then, either the fatigue finally hit him or he simply lost concentration; he fell hopelessly off the pace and Reiff accelerated for home. On the penultimate bend Reiff was leading by a good 20 metres from Slijkhuis, with Zatopek a further 25 metres back, splashing doggedly through the puddles in Wembley's red cinder track, apparently without a chance. Suddenly he seemed to wake up, and began a frantic last-ditch sprint. Within 150 metres he had gobbled up Slijkhuis, and in the final straight he closed on Reiff, who was alerted to the danger only when the crowd's roar became hysterical. Reiff lunged desperately for the tape and won by a couple of feet; if the race had been 10 metres longer, Zatopek would have beaten him. Czechoslovakia had found a national hero, and life could hardly have been better. A few weeks after the Games he married the national javelin champion Dana Ingrova (who, by the most bizarre of coincidences, had been born on the same day as he had) - a stable and happy partnership which visibly sustained both of them in the public years as sporting celebrities, and by all accounts made life a lot more tolerable when, in later life, they fell foul of the Czechoslovak political system. She survives him: they had no children. For the next three years Zatopek was the undisputed master. From 1949 to 1951 he competed in 69 long-distance races (a schedule that would be simply unthinkable for any elite runner today) and won every one of them. From his first race at 10,000 metres in 1948 to his 38th in 1954 he was unbeaten at the distance. He won the European 10,000 metres championship in Brussels in 1950 by a full lap, and the 5,000 metres by 23 seconds. He broke 18 world records at distances from 5,000 metres to 30 kilometres, and in 1951 he became the first man to run 20 kilometres in under an hour. He was, in short, a phenomenon. Expectations for success at Helsinki in 1952 were naturally high, but the pressures on him mounted as the Games approached. He had run with a virus at a minor domestic meeting six weeks earlier, and became ill; he recovered, but the slow times in his build-up races were worrying. He also had his first serious brush with the communist authorities in Prague, when a young 1,500 metres runner, Stanislav Jungwirth, was dropped from the Czech Olympic team because his father had been jailed for political offences; Zatopek even threatened to pull out of the Games himself unless Jungwirth were reinstated, and the brinkmanship was successful, though hardly an aid to concentration. Then there were reports, which he refused to confirm, that he might be persuaded to run the marathon rather than - or, conceivably, as well as - the 5,000 metres. Furthermore, he was in Finland, the land of Kolehmainen and Nurmi, where for the last 40 years distance running had been meat, drink, mother's milk and a second religion; every step he took would be under the scrutiny of the most knowledgeable athletics audience in the world. On the first Sunday he took the 10,000 metres gold medal more or less as he pleased, shaking off his opponents one by one with his unwavering pace to win by the length of the straight. On the Tuesday he was visibly relaxed, and came close to clowning his way through the 5,000 metres heats, dropping back down the field, cajoling and pacing lesser runners to qualification once the stragglers had been dropped. Two days later the Olympic stadium was full to bursting, with more than 66,000 spectators for the most eagerly awaited single event of the Games, the 5,000 metres final. The pace was fast, and no one had the courage to make a decisive break until, well into the final lap, Zatopek accelerated into the lead. In any race during the previous four years, that would have been decisive: if Zatopek led in the final lap, Zatopek won the race. But after a few strides in front he experienced something that had never happened to him in his career before, and which would have devastated a lesser spirit: with 300 metres to go, three men charged past him - the red-headed Christopher Chataway of Great Britain; the bespectacled Herbert Schade of Germany, who had been widely tipped to win the race; and the French-Algerian Alain Mimoun, who had followed Zatopek home in the 10,000 metres.

Dana clinched the day's second gold medal for the family by throwing an Olympic record in the first round of the javelin to beat a powerful Russian trio into second, third and fourth places, and Emil, joking that a 2-1 score in the family gold count was too close for comfort, confirmed that he would indeed run in the marathon - the first of his life - the following Sunday. The story of the Helsinki marathon has entered legend: how Zatopek introduced himself to the favourite, Jim Peters of Great Britain, at the start, and ran with him for the first hour; how - in a genuine search for information rather than a masterly piece of gamesmanship - he asked Peters if the pace was quick enough and, somewhat to his surprise, received the answer \"No, too slow\"; and how he left Peters and all the other leaders behind him and drew steadily away.

      "body": "<p><strong>1</strong> Olympiakos get the game underway. A big test for Liverpool tonight against a team with a formidable home record. <br> <strong>2</strong> Brazilian Giovanni has an early pop toward the Liverpool goal, but it is difficult to tell whether he was actually aiming at the goal or at an imaginary team-mate in acres of space ahead of him.<br> <strong>5</strong> A tame start so far, with the crowd doing a little whistling but nothing to suggest that the ref might be intimidated into a rash of suspicious decisions (ask Gerard Houllier). <br> <strong>10</strong> Traore attempts to break down the left and plays a one-two with Owen before Liverpool win a throw-in.<br> <strong>11</strong> Traore then does a good job of pinning back Amanatidis as the Greeks try to move up their right flank.<br> <strong>12</strong> The first screams of discontent rise above the constant whine of whistling when the ref fails to award a free-kick to the Olympiakos. <br> <strong>14</strong> First shot on target for the home side when Alexandris finds himself in possession on the edge of the area. Seems almost surprised to be in such a fortunate position and instead of executing a neat curling left-foot shot around Westerveld, he opts to curl it straight at him.<br> <strong>17</strong> Olympiakos win a free-kick 25 yeards out... straight at the wall. Djordjevic gets on to the rebound but puts his shot the wrong side of the crossbar.<br> <strong>20</strong> Heskey does well to hold off three players 25 yards out; Liverpool knock it about before Murphy fails to find Heskey running through on the edge of the area.<br> <strong>22</strong> This is pretty dull stuff, it has to be said. It has to be said also that there is still a lot left to play for, but the prospect of 90 minutes of dirge is not good for the soul. As if to underline the point, Olympiakos push up on the right and deliver a cross of Conference quality.<br> <strong>23 Booking</strong> Traore. My heart, such excitement.<br> <strong>24</strong> Could things be livening up? Possibly. Olympiakos have another attempt on goal when Giovanni gets up well in the area for a header, but Westerveld is equal to it.<br> <strong>30</strong> Liverpool manage to get up after a protracted spell pinned back in their half. Westerveld finds Heskey with a long kick, Heskey takes it on his chest and falls over before Gerrard steps up for a snap shot from 30 yards that is sound enough to test the grip of Eleftheropoulos in the Olympiakos goal. <br> <strong>36</strong> Liverpool giving away a lot of free-kicks, thanks in large part to some reckless tackling from Traore. <br> <strong>37</strong> Screams from the crowd as Alexandris is called offside just after being knocked to the ground by Westerveld. <br> <strong>38 GOAL Olympiakos 0 - 1 Liverpool</strong> The Greeks go to sleep after this disappointment and in the process serve to wake up the rest of us. Heskey heads on a Carragher throw from the edge of the area and Barmby pops it away from close range while . Simple stuff... game on.<br> <strong>41</strong> Liverpool free-kick from 20 yards. Hamann and Murphy eye the chance, but it is Murphy who finds the gap in the wall to force a fine diving save from keeper Eleftheropoulos.<br> <strong>44</strong> Alexandris gets away into space with only two to beat, but Hyypia reads it and stops him short of the area.<br> <strong>45</strong> Olympiakos finish the half with a move that ends in a shocking cross by Djordjevic. Still, at least we had a goal... half-time.</p> <p><strong>46 Substitution</strong> Staunton on for Traore.<br> <strong>48</strong>Still no sign that the game is about to spring to life despite the fact that Olympiakos now have to pull out the stops.<br> <strong>50</strong> First corner of the match and it goes Liverpool's way.

      "bodyText": "1 Olympiakos get the game underway. A big test for Liverpool tonight against a team with a formidable home record. 2 Brazilian Giovanni has an early pop toward the Liverpool goal, but it is difficult to tell whether he was actually aiming at the goal or at an imaginary team-mate in acres of space ahead of him. 5 A tame start so far, with the crowd doing a little whistling but nothing to suggest that the ref might be intimidated into a rash of suspicious decisions (ask Gerard Houllier). 10 Traore attempts to break down the left and plays a one-two with Owen before Liverpool win a throw-in. 11 Traore then does a good job of pinning back Amanatidis as the Greeks try to move up their right flank. 12 The first screams of discontent rise above the constant whine of whistling when the ref fails to award a free-kick to the Olympiakos. 14 First shot on target for the home side when Alexandris finds himself in possession on the edge of the area. Seems almost surprised to be in such a fortunate position and instead of executing a neat curling left-foot shot around Westerveld, he opts to curl it straight at him. 17 Olympiakos win a free-kick 25 yeards out... straight at the wall. Djordjevic gets on to the rebound but puts his shot the wrong side of the crossbar. 20 Heskey does well to hold off three players 25 yards out; Liverpool knock it about before Murphy fails to find Heskey running through on the edge of the area. 22 This is pretty dull stuff, it has to be said. It has to be said also that there is still a lot left to play for, but the prospect of 90 minutes of dirge is not good for the soul. As if to underline the point, Olympiakos push up on the right and deliver a cross of Conference quality. 23 Booking Traore. My heart, such excitement. 24 Could things be livening up? Possibly. Olympiakos have another attempt on goal when Giovanni gets up well in the area for a header, but Westerveld is equal to it. 30 Liverpool manage to get up after a protracted spell pinned back in their half. Westerveld finds Heskey with a long kick, Heskey takes it on his chest and falls over before Gerrard steps up for a snap shot from 30 yards that is sound enough to test the grip of Eleftheropoulos in the Olympiakos goal. 36 Liverpool giving away a lot of free-kicks, thanks in large part to some reckless tackling from Traore. 37 Screams from the crowd as Alexandris is called offside just after being knocked to the ground by Westerveld. 38 GOAL Olympiakos 0 - 1 Liverpool The Greeks go to sleep after this disappointment and in the process serve to wake up the rest of us. Heskey heads on a Carragher throw from the edge of the area and Barmby pops it away from close range while . Simple stuff... game on. 41 Liverpool free-kick from 20 yards. Hamann and Murphy eye the chance, but it is Murphy who finds the gap in the wall to force a fine diving save from keeper Eleftheropoulos. 44 Alexandris gets away into space with only two to beat, but Hyypia reads it and stops him short of the area. 45 Olympiakos finish the half with a move that ends in a shocking cross by Djordjevic. Still, at least we had a goal... half-time. 46 Substitution Staunton on for Traore. 48Still no sign that the game is about to spring to life despite the fact that Olympiakos now have to pull out the stops. 50 First corner of the match and it goes Liverpool's way. Staunton takes, Heskey comes flying in at the near post... and heads wide. 52 Liverpool come close to getting a second. Heskey fashions a chance out of nothing when he whips in a cross towards Barmby at the far post. Barmby has to lean back to shoot and is desperately unluck to see his effort rebound off the underside of the crossbar and land the wrong side of the line. 56 Olympiakos are caught short at the back when a misunderstanding between the keeper and one of his defenders requires some elaborate passing before the ball can be cleared. 58 Substitution The power of the crowd suddenly makes itself felt as the Olympiakos coach tries to take off Djordjevic; the crowd scream their disapproval and the coach backs down immediately, deciding instead to pull off Mavrogenidis. 61 Booking Babbel. 63 Olympiakos appear to be waking up a bit and push up on the left. A corner results, but comes to nothing. 65 GOAL Olympiakos 1 - 1 Liverpool Coming to life was obviously an understatement. Giovanni crosses from the right edge of the area and Alexandris scores the equaliser with a spectacular bicycle kick. The crowd goes wild. 66 Substitution Smicer on for Owen. 67 GOAL Olympiakos 1 - 2 Liverpool So much for that. Heskey, as if to underline his already considerable contribution to this match, wins a corner on the left from and Gerrard glances a header to the far post to regain the lead The crowd falls silent. 72 Substitution Georgatos on for Zetterberg. 74 Heskey is pulled down on the right edge of the area for a free-kick.

      "body": "<p>The likelihood is growing that the United States will launch military strikes against targets inside Afghanistan, with tacit or overt Russian backing, before President Bill Clinton leaves office on January 20.</p> <p>The ostensible justification for the attack, if it comes, will be retaliation for the suicide terrorist bombing of the USS Cole in the Yemeni port of Aden last month which killed 17 American sailors.</p> <p>Although FBI investigators have made slow progress with the Cole inquiry, amid disagreements with Yemeni authorities, Clinton administration officials in Washington now say they have established links between the Aden attack and the 1998 bombing of US embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania.</p> <p>The 1998 attacks, which killed 224 people, were blamed by the US on an Islamic terrorist network run by Osama bin Laden, a millionaire Saudi renegade who has his principal bases and training camps in Afghanistan (where he enjoys the protection of the fundamentalist Taliban regime).</p> <p>The network of terrorist cells masterminded by Bin Laden, who has pledged himself in particular to driving US forces out of the Gulf, is now the prime suspect in the Cole attack.</p> <p>Investigators are said to have found similarities between the Aden and Nairobi bombings in respect of the type of explosive used, the detonation device, and the apparent involvement in both incidents of an unnamed, non-Yemeni explosives expert.</p> <p>The US launched limited cruise missile strikes against Bin Laden's Afghan bases after the east African bombings. But he himself evaded harm or capture. Three of his alleged henchmen are currently in custody and awaiting trial on terrorist conspiracy charges in New York.</p> <p>William Cohen, the US defence secretary, said during a recent tour of the Gulf that the Bin Laden link was not yet clear cut. But General Henry Shelton, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, has warned that renewed US strikes on Afghanistan are an option under active consideration.</p> <p>Mr Cohen's visit to Saudi Arabia, and that of the US energy secretary, Bill Richardson, was preceded by another terrorist outrage in which a British man, Christopher Rodway, was killed by a car bomb. Another attack on Britons was reported in Riyadh today. The British embassy in Yemen had also been attacked shortly after the Cole was hit.</p> <p>Similar terrorist assaults - such as those on US military bases in Saudi Arabia in 1995 and 1996, on western tourists in Yemen and Egypt in 1998, and a failed attack on another US warship in the Gulf last winter - are all blamed on Islamic militant groups, some of which, ironically, were originally trained and funded by the US during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.</p> <p>These \"Afghan veterans\" have now turned their guns on their former sponsor and its allies (such as Britain) and are linked to religious and ethnic wars and insurgencies ranging from Chechnya on Russia's southern flank to Tajikistan and Uzbekistan (north of Afghanistan) to Pakistan, Kashmir, and the Muslim Uighur areas of western China.</p> <p>This same loose network of Muslim extremists is even said to have been involved in a thwarted attempt to assassinate Russian President Vladimir Putin while he was in Yalta, in the Crimea, last August. </p> <p>The network has also been linked, for example, to the discovery of a cache of explosives materiel in Birmingham where two suspected Islamic militants were arrested last week under anti-terrorism laws.</p> <p>But, as the Americans appear to be determining in Aden, the common thread linking all these groups appears to be Bin Laden and Afghanistan.</p> <p>The US attack, if it goes ahead, is likely to be far more severe than in 1998, possibly involving conventional air power and special forces as well as cruise missiles.</p> <p>Apart from the lack of \"smoking gun\" evidence, factors at present constraining the Clinton administration include worries about further exacerbating tensions across the Middle East (in view of the current Palestinian-Israeli conflict) and domestic political uncertainty in the US.</p> <p>However, one big constraint may be absent this time: Russian reluctance. Prior to Mr Clinton's summit meeting in Moscow last June, Russia and the US issued a joint statement expressing concern over the \"growing influence of extremist groups\" in the region centred on Afghanistan.</p> <p>Separately, Russian officials warned that they might launch \"preventive\" air strikes against terrorist training camps and bases in Afghanistan. For Moscow, the principal concern is militant backing for Chechen separatists. But like India and China, it is also concerned about the broader issues of rising militant Islamic fundamentalism.</p> <p>Both the US and Russia have since stepped up military and economic assistance and training to the central Asian republics bordering Afghanistan. These countries, which include Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, fear destabilisation by Islamic militants backed by Bin Laden and the Taliban, and are particularly worried about a possible spring offensive after suffering violent incursions last summer.</p> <p>The US may use bases in these countries, which are members of Nato's Partnership for Peace programme, to launch attacks. A top US military commander, General Tommy Franks of Central Command, was recently in the region for discussions.</p> <p>A US attack would serve several purposes beyond revenge for the USS Cole bombing. It would, in theory, discourage the rise of Islamic militancy in central Asia and beyond, and punish the Taliban for its support for terrorism.</p> <p>US strikes, especially if backed by Russia and other regional players like India, could also be justified as a way of helping to stem the growing trade in raw opium, used to make heroin, of which Afghanistan is the world's biggest producer.</p> <p>Drug trafficking via Turkey and Russia to western Europe and the US is believed to be funding the terrorists and is, by itself, seen as a major security threat to the West.</p> <p>Given the psychology of the American presidency, a US attack is more likely to happen while Mr Clinton is still in office. The east African and USS Cole bombings took place on his watch. The responsibility for a response is his. He will not want to leave the problem to his successor, whoever that may be.</p> <p>If enough solid evidence and a good moment of opportunity can be found, Mr Clinton will certainly act - to salvage not only America's honour but also his own. After all, with enforced retirement beckoning, he has little to lose now.</p> <p><strong>Email</strong><br> <a href=\"mailto: simon.tisdall@theguardian.com\">simon.tisdall@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><strong>Other articles</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.searchunlimited.co.uk/search97cgi/s97networkr_cgi?QueryText=%28simon+tisdall%29AND+%28VdkPublicationDate+%3E%3D+01%2DSep%2D1998%29&amp;ResultColSize=2000&amp;ResultTemplate=ArchiveFull%2Ehts&amp;Collection=archive&amp;SortSpec=score+Desc&amp;Query=simon+tisdall&amp;ResultStart=1&amp;ResultCount=10&amp;ResultMaxDocs=1000&amp;Dtv=\">More articles by Simon Tisdall</a></p> <p><strong>Related special reports</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/0,2759,377264,00.html\">Israel &amp; the Middle East</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/0,2759,180403,00.html\">Iraq</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/yemen/0,2759,193338,00.html\">Yemen</a></p> <p><strong>Related articles</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,3604,401794,00.html\">November 23: Three Britons injured in Riyadh explosion</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4092873,00.html\">November 18: Saudi car explosion kills Briton</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4081166,00.html\">October 25: US ponders air strikes against Bin Laden</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4076833,00.html\">October 15: West's weak link is terror target</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4076525,00.html\">October 14: Yemen bombers hit UK embassy</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4076024,00.html\">October 13: Sixteen feared dead in attack on US destroyer</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4075698,00.html\">October 12: US destroyer 'rammed', at least four dead</a></p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.al-bab.com/\">Al-bab.com</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.arabicnews.com/\">Arabic News</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.middleeastwire.com\">Middle East News Online</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.middleeastdaily.com\">Middle East Daily</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.secretary.state.gov/index.html\">Madeleine Albright's office</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pmo.gov.il/english\">Ehud Barak's office</a><br><a href=\"http://www.index.gov.il/eng\">Israeli government</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pna.net/\">The Palestinian National Authority</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pna.org/mininfo/\">Palestinian Ministry of Information</a><br><a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/\"> Jerusalem Post</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "The likelihood is growing that the United States will launch military strikes against targets inside Afghanistan, with tacit or overt Russian backing, before President Bill Clinton leaves office on January 20. The ostensible justification for the attack, if it comes, will be retaliation for the suicide terrorist bombing of the USS Cole in the Yemeni port of Aden last month which killed 17 American sailors. Although FBI investigators have made slow progress with the Cole inquiry, amid disagreements with Yemeni authorities, Clinton administration officials in Washington now say they have established links between the Aden attack and the 1998 bombing of US embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania. The 1998 attacks, which killed 224 people, were blamed by the US on an Islamic terrorist network run by Osama bin Laden, a millionaire Saudi renegade who has his principal bases and training camps in Afghanistan (where he enjoys the protection of the fundamentalist Taliban regime). The network of terrorist cells masterminded by Bin Laden, who has pledged himself in particular to driving US forces out of the Gulf, is now the prime suspect in the Cole attack. Investigators are said to have found similarities between the Aden and Nairobi bombings in respect of the type of explosive used, the detonation device, and the apparent involvement in both incidents of an unnamed, non-Yemeni explosives expert. The US launched limited cruise missile strikes against Bin Laden's Afghan bases after the east African bombings. But he himself evaded harm or capture. Three of his alleged henchmen are currently in custody and awaiting trial on terrorist conspiracy charges in New York. William Cohen, the US defence secretary, said during a recent tour of the Gulf that the Bin Laden link was not yet clear cut. But General Henry Shelton, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, has warned that renewed US strikes on Afghanistan are an option under active consideration. Mr Cohen's visit to Saudi Arabia, and that of the US energy secretary, Bill Richardson, was preceded by another terrorist outrage in which a British man, Christopher Rodway, was killed by a car bomb. Another attack on Britons was reported in Riyadh today. The British embassy in Yemen had also been attacked shortly after the Cole was hit. Similar terrorist assaults - such as those on US military bases in Saudi Arabia in 1995 and 1996, on western tourists in Yemen and Egypt in 1998, and a failed attack on another US warship in the Gulf last winter - are all blamed on Islamic militant groups, some of which, ironically, were originally trained and funded by the US during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. These \"Afghan veterans\" have now turned their guns on their former sponsor and its allies (such as Britain) and are linked to religious and ethnic wars and insurgencies ranging from Chechnya on Russia's southern flank to Tajikistan and Uzbekistan (north of Afghanistan) to Pakistan, Kashmir, and the Muslim Uighur areas of western China. This same loose network of Muslim extremists is even said to have been involved in a thwarted attempt to assassinate Russian President Vladimir Putin while he was in Yalta, in the Crimea, last August. The network has also been linked, for example, to the discovery of a cache of explosives materiel in Birmingham where two suspected Islamic militants were arrested last week under anti-terrorism laws. But, as the Americans appear to be determining in Aden, the common thread linking all these groups appears to be Bin Laden and Afghanistan. The US attack, if it goes ahead, is likely to be far more severe than in 1998, possibly involving conventional air power and special forces as well as cruise missiles. Apart from the lack of \"smoking gun\" evidence, factors at present constraining the Clinton administration include worries about further exacerbating tensions across the Middle East (in view of the current Palestinian-Israeli conflict) and domestic political uncertainty in the US. However, one big constraint may be absent this time: Russian reluctance. Prior to Mr Clinton's summit meeting in Moscow last June, Russia and the US issued a joint statement expressing concern over the \"growing influence of extremist groups\" in the region centred on Afghanistan. Separately, Russian officials warned that they might launch \"preventive\" air strikes against terrorist training camps and bases in Afghanistan. For Moscow, the principal concern is militant backing for Chechen separatists. But like India and China, it is also concerned about the broader issues of rising militant Islamic fundamentalism. Both the US and Russia have since stepped up military and economic assistance and training to the central Asian republics bordering Afghanistan. These countries, which include Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, fear destabilisation by Islamic militants backed by Bin Laden and the Taliban, and are particularly worried about a possible spring offensive after suffering violent incursions last summer. The US may use bases in these countries, which are members of Nato's Partnership for Peace programme, to launch attacks. A top US military commander, General Tommy Franks of Central Command, was recently in the region for discussions. A US attack would serve several purposes beyond revenge for the USS Cole bombing. It would, in theory, discourage the rise of Islamic militancy in central Asia and beyond, and punish the Taliban for its support for terrorism. US strikes, especially if backed by Russia and other regional players like India, could also be justified as a way of helping to stem the growing trade in raw opium, used to make heroin, of which Afghanistan is the world's biggest producer. Drug trafficking via Turkey and Russia to western Europe and the US is believed to be funding the terrorists and is, by itself, seen as a major security threat to the West. Given the psychology of the American presidency, a US attack is more likely to happen while Mr Clinton is still in office. The east African and USS Cole bombings took place on his watch. The responsibility for a response is his. He will not want to leave the problem to his successor, whoever that may be. If enough solid evidence and a good moment of opportunity can be found, Mr Clinton will certainly act - to salvage not only America's honour but also his own. After all, with enforced retirement beckoning, he has little to lose now.

The ruling has infuriated arch-rival OK! magazine, which yesterday won a temporary injunction banning the publication of the \"surreptitious\" photos because they had signed an exclusive \u00a31m deal to cover the wedding in New York last Saturday. After two days of legal wrangling, Justice Brooke said: \"The court proposes to allow the appeal and set aside the injunction.\" He added that he would give the reasons for the decision in \"due course\". The ruling could mark the end of exclusive celebrity spreads for births, weddings and divorces in magazines and newspapers. The Hollywood couple, who launched the legal action with OK!, had argued that the photos had been taken \"surreptitiously and against their wishes\". They said that the wedding was a personal event and Hello! had breached their privacy and their contract with OK!. Hello! hit the streets on Monday with its own \"exclusive\" photos snapped by an undercover camera. OK!, which comes out tomorrow, won a temporary ban on the magazine on Tuesday. Hello! was facing the prospect of pulping its 750,000 print run, although around 15,000 lucky readers got to see the snaps before copies were whisked off the shelves.

      "bodyText": "The BBC and ITV have today made a joint approach to the leaders of the three main political parties to take part in two live TV debates in the run-up to the next general election. In an unprecedented move, BBC News director Tony Hall and ITV controller of news and current affairs Steve Anderson have both put their signatures to letters sent to Tony Blair, William Hague and Charles Kennedy. The two broadcasters have joined forces to try to increase the chances of securing the leader debates. Before the last general election in 1997 the BBC and ITV made separate approaches, allowing then prime minister John Major to prevaricate and play the two off against each other. Although Mr Major's lack of confidence was seen as the ultimate deal breaker, the divided approach was a contributing factor. Mr Hall said: \"Televised leader debates are a familiar part of the electoral landscape across the democratic world and it's time British voters had the same opportunity to see the politicians in action.\" Mr Anderson added: \"That is why we are setting aside the usual trench warfare between news broadcasters and uniting behind this important project.\" The joint proposal is for BBC1 and ITV each to broadcast one live, 60-minute debate before a studio audience in peak-time in the last two weeks of the election campaign. David Dimbleby will chair the BBC1 debate, while his brother Jonathan will host the ITV show, which is to be produced by ITN. Both programmes will follow the same format and focus on three key subjects. The proposal is for the party leaders to make an initial statement and then be quizzed about it by each other, before being allowed a closing comment.

This week it is the turn of the Croatian capital, Zagreb, to rue the day it bowed to the French and offered to host an unprecedented summit of European Union and Balkan leaders. To the dismay of Zagreb's million natives, the entire city centre is virtually inaccessible for the benefit of the Eurocrats who have arrived to talk up the ''historic opportunities'' thrown up by the establishing of peace and democracy in most of the Balkan peninsula and what was Yugoslavia. If the European leaders arrive waving chequebooks and promising to disburse some \u00a33bn over the next five years to stabilise and reconstruct the shattered Balkans, much of that money has been previously earmarked for Kosovo, Bosnia and the rest.

The cultures represented by Nigerian, Singaporean, Indian, Scottish, Filipino or Australian Aboriginal English are all very different. So, while a language must be linked to a culture, a language is not inextricably tied to one specific culture. Specific cultural identities can be represented by new varieties of English. </p> <p>In East and Southeast Asia English plays a major role in the region as a lingua franca of the political elite and the Association of Southast Asian Nations. It is also used as a lingua franca between professionals and the business community. </p> <p>But what variety of English will serve as the region's lingua franca? I suggest that a variety which reflects local cultural conventions and pragmatic norms is developing to serve this role. I further suggest that it is this regional variety that will be taught in schools, rather than an external \"native speaker\" variety. </p> <p>The vast majority of people who are learning English are doing so to be able to use this lingua franca. They are not learning English with the express purpose of communicating with native speakers of English. English is being used by non-native speakers with other non-native speakers. The English that they use need not therefore reflect any \"Anglo\" cultural values. This emerging role of English was identified by Gordon Wu of Hong Kong's Hopewell Holdings, who told the Far Eastern Economic Review: \"English is no longer some colonial language. It is the means [by which] we in Asia communicate with the world and one another.\" </p> <p>So regional users of English who are learning English in order to speak to Thais, Koreans, Vietnamese or Japanese do not need teaching materials that promote or discuss \"Anglo\" cultures. What they need are materials that provide some knowledge of the culture of the people they are dealing with. They also need to be aware of their own cultural norms. The cultural values and daily lives of the people in the region who are using English as a regional lingua franca become more important than the cultural values associated with native speakers. </p> <p>This has important implications for English language teaching in the region's schools. It is a regional variety of English, not an external model, that needs to be promoted, because it is a regional variety of English that people in the region will want to use. People will be able to maintain their identity while speaking their variety of English. As Tommy Koh, a senior minister in the Singapore government, put it recently, \"When I speak English I want the world to know I'm a Singaporean.\" </p> <p>The curriculum of a new variety of English should reflect the lives, cultures and values of the learners. Speakers of this new variety will want to preserve their identity by reflecting that identity in the local variety of English they use. </p> <p>English language teaching materials are needed that promote the local or regional variety and represent the cultures of the speakers of these newly developing varieties. These materials also need to contrast regional cultures, so making the English language curriculum more a curriculum of regional cultures. </p> <p>This will not only liberate generations of Asian children who have had to learn how to ask what time the next train to Liverpool Street leaves, but will also alter the nature of what represents an authentic text. Japan's current English teaching goals are that learners should become American English speakers. This is unrealistic and damaging to the cause of ELT. Students are fearful of speaking, because they falsely consider themselves to be poor speakers unless they sound like Americans. However, if students were given a regional variety of English to learn, educated speakers of the regional variety could provide the models. Suitably qualified and trained speakers of the regional variety could be the teachers. External models could, of course, be introduced into the classroom, but as examples of external models, not as the model that the learners are expected to acquire. </p> <p>More research into the development of varieties of English is urgently needed. In particular we need to know what cultural and discourse conventions are being reflected in these new varieties. For example, are compliments being given and received, or requests made, following local cultural values, or following \"Anglo\" values? Are topics in conversation being broached directly or indirectly? The worldwide domination of an \"Anglo\" variety of English is not inevitable. </p> <p>A regional variety of English can reflect local or regional cultures. Governments need not fear that the learning of English will necessarily imbue the learners with inappropriate cultural values or ways of thinking. The best option for regional governments is to promote local varieties of English. Instead of spending large sums of money on importing native-speaking teachers and externally developed materials, funding should be set aside for the professional development of local teachers and for the development of developing regionally appropriate ELT curricula. </p> <p>Andy Kirkpatrick is research professor at the School of Languages and Intercultural Education, Curtin University of Technology, Perth, Australia, and coordinator of the fifth <a href=\"http://hits.curtin.edu.au/~esea\">English in Southeast Asia Conference</a> from December 6-8, 2000.</p>",

What they need are materials that provide some knowledge of the culture of the people they are dealing with. They also need to be aware of their own cultural norms. The cultural values and daily lives of the people in the region who are using English as a regional lingua franca become more important than the cultural values associated with native speakers. This has important implications for English language teaching in the region's schools. It is a regional variety of English, not an external model, that needs to be promoted, because it is a regional variety of English that people in the region will want to use. People will be able to maintain their identity while speaking their variety of English. As Tommy Koh, a senior minister in the Singapore government, put it recently, \"When I speak English I want the world to know I'm a Singaporean.\" The curriculum of a new variety of English should reflect the lives, cultures and values of the learners. Speakers of this new variety will want to preserve their identity by reflecting that identity in the local variety of English they use. English language teaching materials are needed that promote the local or regional variety and represent the cultures of the speakers of these newly developing varieties. These materials also need to contrast regional cultures, so making the English language curriculum more a curriculum of regional cultures. This will not only liberate generations of Asian children who have had to learn how to ask what time the next train to Liverpool Street leaves, but will also alter the nature of what represents an authentic text. Japan's current English teaching goals are that learners should become American English speakers. This is unrealistic and damaging to the cause of ELT. Students are fearful of speaking, because they falsely consider themselves to be poor speakers unless they sound like Americans. However, if students were given a regional variety of English to learn, educated speakers of the regional variety could provide the models. Suitably qualified and trained speakers of the regional variety could be the teachers. External models could, of course, be introduced into the classroom, but as examples of external models, not as the model that the learners are expected to acquire. More research into the development of varieties of English is urgently needed. In particular we need to know what cultural and discourse conventions are being reflected in these new varieties. For example, are compliments being given and received, or requests made, following local cultural values, or following \"Anglo\" values? Are topics in conversation being broached directly or indirectly? The worldwide domination of an \"Anglo\" variety of English is not inevitable. A regional variety of English can reflect local or regional cultures. Governments need not fear that the learning of English will necessarily imbue the learners with inappropriate cultural values or ways of thinking. The best option for regional governments is to promote local varieties of English. Instead of spending large sums of money on importing native-speaking teachers and externally developed materials, funding should be set aside for the professional development of local teachers and for the development of developing regionally appropriate ELT curricula.

His tightly honed but grandiloquent rhetoric rang like gold on marble, even when it was covering gross political ineptitude. At his side in public Jackie's air of sophistication and chic cultural warmth complemented it perfectly. In private she could be softly malicious, sceptical of those who jostled for influence, scurrilously funny, and full of the entertaining intolerance of those who are young, rich, beautiful and (as they think) impregnable.</p> <p>Widowhood and the relationship with Onassis were to prove her mistaken. She lived on, famous but not especially admired, sad but no longer tragic, an icon of stylish jet-set reticence, a living image of tasteful conspicuous consumption, regretted most because she had proved in the end to be more psychologically ordinary than history had hoped.</p> <p>Outwardly, she dwindled the moment she left America, dwarfed by the shadow of a legend that she had outgrown, fulfilling Charles de Gaulle's cynical prediction that she would \"end up on some millionaire's yacht\". Sadly, the second half of her life - much of it spent on beaches or in villas or palatial apartments, after the manner of the idle European super-rich - is little more than a transmutation of the theatrical pure gold of her historically approved widowhood into the base metal of mildly despised celebrity. Ultimately, like most iconic figures, she remains eerily featherweight, more potent as an image than as a rounded or recognisable personality, the reality of her life rendered insubstantial by the public self that replaced it.</p> <p>It seems fruitless now to survey the casual detritus of her life and pronounce her vain, vapid or self-seeking; to call into question her ersatz-aristocratic good taste; or to accuse her of being, at heart, small-minded and avaricious. There's a morally tough common sense in such criticisms that the immaculate self-absorption of her public persona was always designed to elude or frustrate. Her virtues and their mirroring vices belong less to history than to the world of Scott Fitzgerald, and, like so many of Fitzgerald's haunting and ambivalent characters, she was deliberately arrested and incomplete. She lived within the poetic fiction of her own impossible sensitivity, and was eventually doomed by it.</p> <p>In any case, after the husky-sweet ing\u00e9nue of the Kennedy years the Mediterranean-island Jackie - dark, lustful, greedy, perverse - should come as a relief. It's good to see her turning from Audrey Hepburn into Sophia Loren, becoming candidly flesh-driven and obsessively materialistic, as if her hormones were in revolt against the glacial, photogenic dignity in which she had been imprisoned for so long.

      "body": "<p>Bill Clinton ended his three days in Vietnam with the tide of popular support for his visit still apparently surging. But the enthusiasm masked dangerous undercurrents, which suggested that his historic trip had been less than a total triumph.</p> <p>President Clinton spent last Sunday in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, once the capital of South Vietnam and now the country's business hub. Had the security men allowed it, he would have been mobbed once more by delighted crowds.</p> <p>But, as Air Force One took off for Washington, the response of his official hosts was somewhat colder.</p> <p>Local television did not show the delighted crowds in the streets. And Mr Clinton's earlier calls for greater democracy have left some bruises on Vietnam's Communist leaders. Le Kha Phieu, the party secretary general, who is regarded as the most powerful figure in the country, resurrected the word \"imperialists\" to describe the Americans.</p> <p>He is reported to have told the United States president: \"We respect other nations' way of life and political systems. We also demand that other nations respect our country's political system and choices.\" Mr Clinton called their discussion \"a nice little debate\".</p> <p>He left Vietnam heading joltingly towards economic, if not political, liberalisation. But the tone adopted by his hosts suggests that the process is not much helped by US hectoring.</p> <p>\"There is no question there is still a different vision of economics at the highest level of government,\" Mr Clinton's chief economic adviser, Gene Sperling, said.</p> <p>Several smaller incidents suggest that the Americans are as indelicate about Vietnamese sensibilities as they were in the old days.</p> <p>Mr Clinton was horribly late for a night at the Hanoi opera house, keeping everyone waiting. The tableau last Saturday night when he solemnly presided over the return of some bone shards wrapped in the Stars and Stripes seemed merely to emphasise the difference in weight accorded to the 58,000 American war dead compared with the millions of dead Vietnamese.</p> <p>And there was a little argument between two security men about some detail of crowd positioning that seemed to sum up everything. It ended with an American shrug. \"It's your country,\" the American said to the Vietnamese official, before adding: \"But you're wrong.\" That is the US view of Vietnam in a nutshell.</p> <p>There was no denying the welcome the US president received. Thousands gathered just to catch a glimpse of his limo as he drove round at the start of his official visit to Vietnam. He shook hands with all-comers while visiting the Temple of Literature (930 years old) and a Hanoi cappuccino cafe called Know One Teach One.</p> <p>Old Hanoi hands said nothing had been seen on this scale since Fidel Castro hit town in the 1970s. But the Clinton fans belonged almost wholly to the generation born after what the Vietnamese call \"the American war\" ended in 1975. That's the majority of the population.</p> <p>Many of the older generation in the south died; many have emigrated; the rest keep their heads below the parapet.

      "bodyText": "Bill Clinton ended his three days in Vietnam with the tide of popular support for his visit still apparently surging. But the enthusiasm masked dangerous undercurrents, which suggested that his historic trip had been less than a total triumph. President Clinton spent last Sunday in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, once the capital of South Vietnam and now the country's business hub. Had the security men allowed it, he would have been mobbed once more by delighted crowds. But, as Air Force One took off for Washington, the response of his official hosts was somewhat colder. Local television did not show the delighted crowds in the streets. And Mr Clinton's earlier calls for greater democracy have left some bruises on Vietnam's Communist leaders. Le Kha Phieu, the party secretary general, who is regarded as the most powerful figure in the country, resurrected the word \"imperialists\" to describe the Americans. He is reported to have told the United States president: \"We respect other nations' way of life and political systems. We also demand that other nations respect our country's political system and choices.\" Mr Clinton called their discussion \"a nice little debate\". He left Vietnam heading joltingly towards economic, if not political, liberalisation. But the tone adopted by his hosts suggests that the process is not much helped by US hectoring. \"There is no question there is still a different vision of economics at the highest level of government,\" Mr Clinton's chief economic adviser, Gene Sperling, said. Several smaller incidents suggest that the Americans are as indelicate about Vietnamese sensibilities as they were in the old days. Mr Clinton was horribly late for a night at the Hanoi opera house, keeping everyone waiting. The tableau last Saturday night when he solemnly presided over the return of some bone shards wrapped in the Stars and Stripes seemed merely to emphasise the difference in weight accorded to the 58,000 American war dead compared with the millions of dead Vietnamese. And there was a little argument between two security men about some detail of crowd positioning that seemed to sum up everything. It ended with an American shrug. \"It's your country,\" the American said to the Vietnamese official, before adding: \"But you're wrong.\" That is the US view of Vietnam in a nutshell. There was no denying the welcome the US president received. Thousands gathered just to catch a glimpse of his limo as he drove round at the start of his official visit to Vietnam. He shook hands with all-comers while visiting the Temple of Literature (930 years old) and a Hanoi cappuccino cafe called Know One Teach One. Old Hanoi hands said nothing had been seen on this scale since Fidel Castro hit town in the 1970s. But the Clinton fans belonged almost wholly to the generation born after what the Vietnamese call \"the American war\" ended in 1975. That's the majority of the population. Many of the older generation in the south died; many have emigrated; the rest keep their heads below the parapet. But the entrepreneurial spirit remains strong here, and the president devoted most of his last day to economic themes. He made his setpiece appearance far from the city centre, at the new freight terminal as the guest of the US shipping company APL: American President Lines. This was the new Vietnam that the White House wants to foster. On a stifling day, almost all of them sat in the open air wearing uniform white shirts and APL baseball caps. It could have been a Japanese sales conference, the sort of gig Mr Clinton might have to play if nothing better comes up after he loses his current job. It was certainly an occasion that made Le Kha Phieu's earlier protestations of continuing socialist purity hard to believe. The president noted that Vietnam's exports had increased sixfold in a decade. \"You will grow even more as your economy becomes more open and the rule of law develops.\" He also praised the high literacy rate. \"Imagine how much more you will achieve,\" he went on, \"as even more young people gain more freedom to shape the decisions that affect their lives.\" Mr Clinton insisted: \"The years of animosity are past. We have a stake in your future and we wish to be your partners.\" But that partnership may be a bad-tempered one as long as the two political cultures remain so distinct.

Mr Bush's spokeswoman, Karen Hughes, said: \"I heard someone compare it to a marathon. You think there's a finish line and as you cross it someone says, 'Oh, by the way, it's not over.\"'</p> <p>While most Americans were feasting on turkey - the Thanksgiving holiday\u00d5s traditional meal - Broward County election officials were instead tackling the contentious paper ballot election chads.</p> <p>The officials gave up their holiday to continue counting ballots before the Sunday deadline set by the Florida supreme court.</p> <p>Mr Gore and Mr Bush each planned a Thanksgiving dinner with their families, in Washington and Texas, respectively.</p> <p>Mr Bush holds a 930-vote lead in Florida, not counting the results of manual recounts initiated at Gore's behest in the three counties, where 1.7m of the state's 6m ballots were cast.</p> <p>Election workers in Palm Beach County took the holiday off and were to resume their count Friday. A Palm Beach County judge said officials must consider \"dimpled chad\" punch card ballots - those that show an indentation but no perforation.</p> <p>However, Judge Jorge Labarga said elections officials can reject the questionable ballots if the voters' intent can't be determined.</p> <p>The elections board chief, Charles Burton, said both sides would be able to make their cases tomorrow but on first glance he didn't think the ruling would change the way his board has judged ballots. Mr Gore wants the county to loosen its standards.</p> <p>Democrats planned an appeal to the Florida supreme court to force Miami-Dade County to resume counting after a three-judge lower court panel turned them down.</p> <p>The county's election board abruptly halted the count yesterday, saying there was no way it could be completed by Sunday at 5pm (2200 GMT), the deadline set by the state supreme court.</p> <p>Away from the courts and counting rooms, the Republican vice presidential candidate, Dick Cheney, was in a Washington hospital recovering from a \"a very slight heart attack\" - his fourth. He underwent surgery yesterday to implant an artery-clearing device.</p> <p>Mr Cheney, 59, said on CNN's \"Larry King Live\" program that he hoped to be discharged from the hospital in \"a day or two\".

      "bodyText": "Election 2000 stretched into the Thanksgiving holiday today without a president-elect as the battle between George W Bush and Al Gore over Florida's crucial electoral votes finally reached the US supreme court. The laborious hand recount resumed in Broward County, as the Gore campaign asked the Florida Supreme Court to order Miami-Dade officials to resume and complete a full handcount or at least the 10,000 'undervotes' - those with possible indented chads that machines didn't read the first time. \"We believe the Supreme Court didn't want its deadline used as an excuse not to count the vote,\" Gore spokesman Doug Hattaway said. And ,citing the risk of a constitutional crisis, Mr Bush's lawyers had last night asked the high court justices to block a decision by the Florida supreme court to allow hand counts in three Democratic-leaning Florida counties. The appeal said that, without a decision by the supreme court before 18 December when each state's electors cast the final vote on who next will occupy the White House, \"the consequences may well include the ascension of a president of questionable legitimacy, or a constitutional crisis.\" The seemingly never-ending presidential race remains unpredictable. Mr Bush's spokeswoman, Karen Hughes, said: \"I heard someone compare it to a marathon. You think there's a finish line and as you cross it someone says, 'Oh, by the way, it's not over.\"' While most Americans were feasting on turkey - the Thanksgiving holiday\u00d5s traditional meal - Broward County election officials were instead tackling the contentious paper ballot election chads. The officials gave up their holiday to continue counting ballots before the Sunday deadline set by the Florida supreme court. Mr Gore and Mr Bush each planned a Thanksgiving dinner with their families, in Washington and Texas, respectively. Mr Bush holds a 930-vote lead in Florida, not counting the results of manual recounts initiated at Gore's behest in the three counties, where 1.7m of the state's 6m ballots were cast. Election workers in Palm Beach County took the holiday off and were to resume their count Friday. A Palm Beach County judge said officials must consider \"dimpled chad\" punch card ballots - those that show an indentation but no perforation. However, Judge Jorge Labarga said elections officials can reject the questionable ballots if the voters' intent can't be determined. The elections board chief, Charles Burton, said both sides would be able to make their cases tomorrow but on first glance he didn't think the ruling would change the way his board has judged ballots. Mr Gore wants the county to loosen its standards. Democrats planned an appeal to the Florida supreme court to force Miami-Dade County to resume counting after a three-judge lower court panel turned them down. The county's election board abruptly halted the count yesterday, saying there was no way it could be completed by Sunday at 5pm (2200 GMT), the deadline set by the state supreme court. Away from the courts and counting rooms, the Republican vice presidential candidate, Dick Cheney, was in a Washington hospital recovering from a \"a very slight heart attack\" - his fourth. He underwent surgery yesterday to implant an artery-clearing device. Mr Cheney, 59, said on CNN's \"Larry King Live\" program that he hoped to be discharged from the hospital in \"a day or two\". He joked: \"I can tell you they didn't find any pregnant chads.\" Mr Bush also filed suit in a Florida court asking 13 counties with heavy military populations to count overseas ballots. Hundreds of ballots, many from military outposts, were rejected last week when Democratic lawyers urged country boards to scrutinise them. Both sides believe Mr Bush lost more votes than Mr Gore in the rejected ballots. The Florida supreme court's decision on Tuesday night directing the Florida secretary of state, Katherine Harris, to include the results of the hand recounts in the state's certified vote totals has triggered Republican lawmakers in both Tallahassee and Washington threatening challenges to Mr Gore electors. Mr Gore now has 267 electors pledged to him, Bush 246. Florida's 25 electors would give either the 270 majority needed to be declared the winner. The US presidency is determined not by the nationwide popular vote, which Mr Gore won, but by the vote of the electoral college, a panel which is to meet December 18. Each state - along with the district of Washington DC - sends three delegates plus an additional number based on its population. In Florida and in all but two of the remaining US states, all of the delegates are generally committed to choosing the candidate who won the winner-take-all statewide vote. Republicans, who hold majorities in both houses of Florida's legislature as well as in Congress, talked of convening to overturn the effect of a Florida court decision they noted was made by seven judges appointed by Democratic governors. Tom Feeney, Florida's new House speaker, was ready to \"ensure an electoral college representation for Florida\" - though he also suggested last night that everyone \"relax, take a deep breath for at least 24 hours.\" In Washington, House majority leader Dick Armey, of Texas, said Republicans in Congress were prepared to disqualify Florida's electors if the outcome of Florida's recount does not appear to be legitimate.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>JUST FOR THE RECORD</strong> </p> <p>As footballers go, Norwegians have looser tongues than most. It's the law. Whether it's Vegard Heggem revealing how his pre-season training was disturbed by young boys shouting: \"You're shit,\" at him, or Steffen Iversen moaning about being woken up at 3am by the filming of Bridget Jones' diary, it seems they can't stop sounding off. So imagine our anticipation, no really, when we attended a press conference announcing Rangers' Scottish record signing of Tore Andre Flo from Chelsea for \u00a312m.</p> <p>What an anti-climax. Because on the flight to Scotland something seems to have happened to poor Tore (\"nothing to do with me!\" - Squadron Leader Fiver). He looks the same. Heck he even sounds the same. But his personality has been stripped, leaving only a walking footie-speak computer programme in its place. \"I like Chelsea very much. It is a great club. But unfortunately for me I was not playing enough, so I had to do something. I am very happy to get this opportunity,\" Flo revealed robotically, adding the old favourite: \"I wanted to go to a club that can win something and I believe we can do it here.\" </p> <p>Realising that Tore was doing little to get our mind off Brian Woolnough's Bouffant (parked right in front of us, and held up by John Frieda lacquer), the Fiver fed Tore a sitter and asked if he was excited at the prospect of making his debut against Celtic. But even that failed! \"I've watched derby games on TV and I understand it is very important for the people here,\" he explained, before dashing off to buy a light emitting diode.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>ALL MOUTH AND NO \u00a318M TRANSFER</strong></p> <p>The good angels and the bad devils are still out on Rio Ferdinand's shoulder, debating the pros and cons of a move to Leeds. \"We hear the nightlife's great\", says the devil, while the angel, in a high voice, suggests \"You wouldn't want to make poor Harry cry, would you?\" It is true that the rolling Yorkshire countryside is no Peckham High Street, but then Lucas Radebe is no Stevie Potts either. Yes, there's a lot for young Rio to weigh up (including a big pile of cash marked: \"Your first week's wages\") so it's not entirely surprising that there is no decision expected from Rio before tomorrow.</p> <p>But that hasn't stopped the rumour mill from breaking free of its moorings and running amok through East London. First of all, quite a few of tomorrow's fish papers had 'Appy 'Arry down as a dead cert to sign Rigobert Song from Liverpool for \u00a32.5m. Some even said it would happen today. But it didn't and one of the increasing number of West Ham officials (Terry Brown, Peter Barnes and now) Paul Aldridge said: \"I can assure you that nothing like that is going to happen here today, and maybe never.\" </p> <p>Big boo. Other bits of goss persist: the Hammers are in for Perugia's Mauro Milanese, 'Arry wants PSG's Sylvain Distin, but nothing looks like happening today, and maybe never. Maybe Frederic Kanoute will never leave Upton Park either. The French forward, who impresses everyone with his skills, and not many with his goals, has been the subject of an \u00a38m approach from Chelsea. The Hammers turned the bid down, but in this day and age that doesn't mean an awful lot. Far more valuable is the fact that Freddie has told his own website: \"Let me tell you something: the day I leave West Ham I will choose a side where I'll be a regular in the team.\" A ringing endorsement if ever we heard one.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"All I can say is that I am very flattered by the suggestions.

The same day that fashionable boutique Chelsea's of Chelsea flog their remaindered Norwegian to some Glaswegian bowler hat distributors, little Crystal Palace get a phone call. The phone call, which the Fiver was not privilege to, probably went a little something like this: \"Hi, this is Claudio Ranieri's translator here. See we lent you prodigal Finnish striker Mikael Forssell for the whole season? Well we kind of want him back.\" \"Well you can't have him.\" \"Why?\" \"Cos rule is rules.\" \"Mr Ranieri would like to say something.\" \"Yeah, what's that?\" \"*@&amp;#!!!!\"</p> <p>Yes, it's funny how the iniquities of Football League law only seem to bite when you're a striker light. Forssell, who was out of first team contention at Stamford Bridge, hasn't exactly impressed at Selhurst Park either, scoring two goals in 12 starts and losing his starting place to transfer-listed Clinton Morrison. But Forssell has been loaned to the Eagles for the entire season and, according to the Football League, that means the player stays with the club for the entire season. What planet are they living on?</p> <p>\"It is made clear to the clubs involved that this is a commitment for a whole season, and the effect is the same as a player signing a one-year contract with a club\", a League spokesman said today. \"We cannot change the rules halfway through a season.\" Which didn't impress Colin Hutchinson, Chelsea's Captain Peacock, one bit. \"It is very unfortunate that Mikael Forssell is stranded at Crystal Palace\", he said, to the accompaniment of a string quartet. \"We have appealed to the Football League, with the support of Crystal Palace, but the League are just quoting the rule book at us.\" But don't worry Colin, we sense the people are right behind you.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Alen Boksic is being linked with a move to Panathinaikos after visiting the team at their hotel in Manchester earlier this week, reports Teamtalk.</p> <p>Newcastle are lining up a move for Bayer Leverkusen's Croatian international Robert Kovac, reports Teamtalk. </p> <p>Dean Windass is a target for Celtic and Charlton Athletic, claims Planet Football.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>NEWS IN BRIEF</strong></p> <p>South Africa striker Benni McCarthy could be coming to England after all, despite his club Celta Vigo rejecting a \u00a39m bid from Aston Villa.

      "bodyText": "JUST FOR THE RECORD As footballers go, Norwegians have looser tongues than most. It's the law. Whether it's Vegard Heggem revealing how his pre-season training was disturbed by young boys shouting: \"You're shit,\" at him, or Steffen Iversen moaning about being woken up at 3am by the filming of Bridget Jones' diary, it seems they can't stop sounding off. So imagine our anticipation, no really, when we attended a press conference announcing Rangers' Scottish record signing of Tore Andre Flo from Chelsea for \u00a312m. What an anti-climax. Because on the flight to Scotland something seems to have happened to poor Tore (\"nothing to do with me!\" - Squadron Leader Fiver). He looks the same. Heck he even sounds the same. But his personality has been stripped, leaving only a walking footie-speak computer programme in its place. \"I like Chelsea very much. It is a great club. But unfortunately for me I was not playing enough, so I had to do something. I am very happy to get this opportunity,\" Flo revealed robotically, adding the old favourite: \"I wanted to go to a club that can win something and I believe we can do it here.\" Realising that Tore was doing little to get our mind off Brian Woolnough's Bouffant (parked right in front of us, and held up by John Frieda lacquer), the Fiver fed Tore a sitter and asked if he was excited at the prospect of making his debut against Celtic. But even that failed! \"I've watched derby games on TV and I understand it is very important for the people here,\" he explained, before dashing off to buy a light emitting diode. * * * * * * * * * * * * * ALL MOUTH AND NO \u00a318M TRANSFER The good angels and the bad devils are still out on Rio Ferdinand's shoulder, debating the pros and cons of a move to Leeds. \"We hear the nightlife's great\", says the devil, while the angel, in a high voice, suggests \"You wouldn't want to make poor Harry cry, would you?\" It is true that the rolling Yorkshire countryside is no Peckham High Street, but then Lucas Radebe is no Stevie Potts either. Yes, there's a lot for young Rio to weigh up (including a big pile of cash marked: \"Your first week's wages\") so it's not entirely surprising that there is no decision expected from Rio before tomorrow. But that hasn't stopped the rumour mill from breaking free of its moorings and running amok through East London. First of all, quite a few of tomorrow's fish papers had 'Appy 'Arry down as a dead cert to sign Rigobert Song from Liverpool for \u00a32.5m. Some even said it would happen today. But it didn't and one of the increasing number of West Ham officials (Terry Brown, Peter Barnes and now) Paul Aldridge said: \"I can assure you that nothing like that is going to happen here today, and maybe never.\" Big boo. Other bits of goss persist: the Hammers are in for Perugia's Mauro Milanese, 'Arry wants PSG's Sylvain Distin, but nothing looks like happening today, and maybe never. Maybe Frederic Kanoute will never leave Upton Park either. The French forward, who impresses everyone with his skills, and not many with his goals, has been the subject of an \u00a38m approach from Chelsea. The Hammers turned the bid down, but in this day and age that doesn't mean an awful lot. Far more valuable is the fact that Freddie has told his own website: \"Let me tell you something: the day I leave West Ham I will choose a side where I'll be a regular in the team.\" A ringing endorsement if ever we heard one. * * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"All I can say is that I am very flattered by the suggestions. It is obvious I am out of work at the moment and I am looking at a way back into football.\" Steve Bruce tries the \"Give me the job because I'm unemployed\" approach to landing the manager's job at Hearts. * * * * * * * * * * * * * FORSS MAJEUR Who would have thought it? The same day that fashionable boutique Chelsea's of Chelsea flog their remaindered Norwegian to some Glaswegian bowler hat distributors, little Crystal Palace get a phone call. The phone call, which the Fiver was not privilege to, probably went a little something like this: \"Hi, this is Claudio Ranieri's translator here. See we lent you prodigal Finnish striker Mikael Forssell for the whole season? Well we kind of want him back.\" \"Well you can't have him.\" \"Why?\" \"Cos rule is rules.\" \"Mr Ranieri would like to say something.\" \"Yeah, what's that?\" \"*@&amp;#!!!!\" Yes, it's funny how the iniquities of Football League law only seem to bite when you're a striker light. Forssell, who was out of first team contention at Stamford Bridge, hasn't exactly impressed at Selhurst Park either, scoring two goals in 12 starts and losing his starting place to transfer-listed Clinton Morrison. But Forssell has been loaned to the Eagles for the entire season and, according to the Football League, that means the player stays with the club for the entire season. What planet are they living on? \"It is made clear to the clubs involved that this is a commitment for a whole season, and the effect is the same as a player signing a one-year contract with a club\", a League spokesman said today. \"We cannot change the rules halfway through a season.\" Which didn't impress Colin Hutchinson, Chelsea's Captain Peacock, one bit. \"It is very unfortunate that Mikael Forssell is stranded at Crystal Palace\", he said, to the accompaniment of a string quartet. \"We have appealed to the Football League, with the support of Crystal Palace, but the League are just quoting the rule book at us.\" But don't worry Colin, we sense the people are right behind you. * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Alen Boksic is being linked with a move to Panathinaikos after visiting the team at their hotel in Manchester earlier this week, reports Teamtalk. Newcastle are lining up a move for Bayer Leverkusen's Croatian international Robert Kovac, reports Teamtalk. Dean Windass is a target for Celtic and Charlton Athletic, claims Planet Football. * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF South Africa striker Benni McCarthy could be coming to England after all, despite his club Celta Vigo rejecting a \u00a39m bid from Aston Villa. McCarthy's agent Rob Moore told Planet Football: \"I really believe he will end up in England. He is itching to get to the Premier League.\" Former Bradford City manager Chris Hutchings could team up with Paul Jewell again after applying to run the Sheffield Wednesday Youth Academy. Steve Bruce had admitted he is interested in the vacant manager's job at Hearts - but he refused to confirm whether he was on the shortlist being considered by chief executive Chris Robinson. \"It is obvious I am out of work at the moment and I am looking at a way back into football,\" he admitted. \"Hearts are a big club but we will wait and see.\" * * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO (JON \"FOWL UP\" FOWLER SPECIAL) BBC 2: Match of the Day Live: Olympiakos v Liverpool (6.50pm) Look Jon, it's not that difficult: The first half is on BBC 2.

      "body": "<p>It's that time of year again when those of us who cannot shop are forced to compete with the people who do it all year round. Ideally there should be a few shopping days set aside for people who don't know what they're doing; who cannot choose colours or remember sizes, or, when it comes to making purchases for others, haven't an original thought in their head or an aesthetic bone in their body. But there are no such days. Christmas is a free-for-all, and amateurs suffer. </p> <p>The main difficulty lies in the presents themselves. We try to tailor the presents we buy to the people we buy them for, but this is not always possible. Christmas presents are not like other presents. They are not birthday presents or anniversary presents. They are not meant to reflect complex sentiments, or private emotions. </p> <p>Christmas is not the time to select gifts that show a deep understanding of the recipient's inner life, unless a travel iron does that. Christmas shopping is first and foremost a race against the clock. There may well be a perfect Christmas present out there to suit each and every individual, but if it's not at eye-level in John Lewis at 5.30pm on a Wednesday, then it's not going to be under the tree either. </p> <p>Christmas shopping means buying presents in bulk - at the same speed favoured by Supermarket Sweep contestants - and in many cases for people whose likes and dislikes are largely unknown to us. </p> <p>This is where those so-called popular presents come in, the stuff that everybody seems to be buying; the toys, games, books, clothes and kitchen implements which over the course of the Christmas period become absolute must-have items for people who don't know they're getting them. </p> <p>The new Beatles CD is a perfect example. A collection of old Beatles No1 hits is about the most anodyne, impersonal present imaginable, which is why every man, woman and child in Britain will find themselves in possession of a copy come Boxing Day. </p> <p>As a present it is safe, reasonably priced and easy to track down. In many outlets it will probably be available in a ready-wrapped condition. It is that most horrible and, sadly, necessary of things: the great gift idea. </p> <p>Great gift ideas are not, generally speaking, actually great, or even really ideas. They are simply a guide to getting through your Christmas shopping while expending the least amount of imagination possible, and so they are invaluable. </p> <p>Great gift ideas are items that the shops have guessed people will buy, hoping their friends and relatives will want them. There is a whole new crop each year, but there are always seven basic categories: bestselling hardback, hilarious novelty, crowd-pleasing CD (see Beatles, Sade, etc), electronic gizmo, gay apparel and alcohol. </p> <p>As far as the hardback is concerned, there is only one real contender this year: Nigella Lawson's new cookbook, How To Be A Domestic Goddess. Perfect: grab one. Don't start worrying about where you stand on the whole \"Nigella\" thing. This is not about you. Just buy it. You can figure out who it's for when you get it home. If you've got time, root through the pile for a signed copy, which always gives a book that extra personal touch. If there aren't any signed copies, sign it yourself; nobody knows what Nigella's handwriting looks like. </p> <p>The Booker Prize winner is also a fairly safe bet (Margaret Atwood's The Blind Assassin, in case you've forgotten), and it says \"BOOKER PRIZE WINNER\" right on the cover, which shows that you care enough to give only the very best. If both books are for the same person, remember to use different pens for the signatures. </p> <p>Novelty gifts, such as the now-famous Billy the Singing Bass, pose a special problem. The publicity surrounding their brisk sales figures ensures that the joke wears ever thinner as Christmas Eve approaches. Everyone who has ventured out shopping has already seen all the novelty gifts on offer, and they've probably done all the laughing they're going to do right there in the shop. </p> <p>Under the circumstances you may feel that the \"novelty\" of a rubber fish singing old rhythm and blues standards is no novelty at all, no matter what the Queen thinks, but you would be missing the point. </p> <p>The general standard of humour plummets at Christmas. Think of those Christmas cracker jokes, and the stuff they put on telly. In comparison, Billy the Bass seems positively highbrow. If you still don't like the idea, try to think of it this way: chances are someone has already got you a Billy the Bass, so prepare a retaliatory strike. </p> <p>Of all Christmas presents, clothes are notoriously the most difficult to get right so the possibility for error is enormous. Luckily, you don't really have to get it right any more. These days clothes are a kind of currency, representing a fixed amount of store credit. All you have to do is pick the right shop, and spend vaguely the right amount of money. The rest is up to the recipient. </p> <p>In theory it doesn't really matter what you buy, but it's best to stick with scarves, shawls, gloves, bags and other items where you can't insult someone by getting the wrong size. Of course, it would be simpler to purchase a gift certificate, but it's nicer to be seen to have made an effort, even when you haven't. </p> <p>Electrical goods seem like complex purchases to negotiate, but this is often because inexperienced shoppers attempt to listen to the technical chatter of sales assistants as if they had all the time in the world. Who cares which video camera is the best? This is Christmas. Get the shiniest one. </p> <p>The same goes for personal organisers and mobile phones. Don't bother with larger gift items such as televisions and personal computers. These are now purchased in January, in the company of the intended recipient, at a fraction of the pre-Christmas price. </p> <p>Perhaps the easiest and most dependable great gift idea is alcohol. It's not really a proper present, which is why people are so pleased to receive it. Giving booze is the closest you can come to giving money without seeming like you're missing the true meaning of Christmas, and your recipients will be almost as grateful. </p> <p>You can even send it directly to their homes after purchasing it online with just a few clicks of the mouse. It may not sound particularly festive, but it does mean that you can continue with your Christmas shopping long after you've lost the will to live.</p>",

There was nothing peevish or pop-eyed about this citizen. The shirt was open-necked. The tilted look was watchful, eyes narrowed against bright light: a non-combatant shocked to find himself exposed on the hustings. No Londoner, according to the spin-doctors, is ever going to vote for a beard. The candidate, a Father Christmas in civvies, knows that better than anyone, knows he's on a loser, but it hasn't dowsed his fire. Actually, this fly-pitched outlaw, spotted on the side of a telephone junction box outside Toynbee Hall, on Commercial Street in Whitechapel, had been got up to look like a charity case, or a Wanted poster. Dead or alive. 'Vote Michael Moorcock', it said. 'King of the City'.</p> <p>King of the City, a hefty London novel, character-packed, busy with competing narratives (confessing, denouncing, celebrating, plea-bargaining for its own sanity), was being punted by its publicists as \"the long-awaited sequel to a Whitbread Prize shortlisted book Mother London\". Clearly, it is nothing of the sort. Prequel, coda, kissing cousin? Arguably. Mother London required no sequel. It could have used some of the fortuitous timing that allows a book to mop up well-deserved honours and achieve a word-of-mouth readership that keeps it running for years. </p> <p>Unfortunately, Mother London was swamped by the extra-literary controversies surrounding The Satanic Verses. One strand in Salman Rushdie's novel, necessarily under-discussed, was Brick Lane-based, a Bollywood derive through the territory where I came across Moorcock's King of the City poster. Both authors have moved on. Rushdie, seduced by the high-definition celebrity culture of New York, new smells, brighter lights, has denounced his old midden for its failure to fire his imagination, but Moorcock, in whatever exile he finds himself, returns obsessively to his dream-source, the city of his birth. Mother London, a book whose reputation continued to grow as it became harder to find, as paperbacks disappeared and hardbacks drifted into charity shops, has now been reissued. Its status as one of the novels by which a substantial portion of London memory can be recovered is assured. The book is a great, humane document, written at a time when the old liberties were under threat and therefore more alive than ever. Mother London pivoted on the Blitz, on psychic damage, small urban miracles worked by human affection, a woman walking out of the fire with a newborn baby in her arms. The novel's trajectory of hurt runs from Thatcher's denial of the concept of society, the unappeased demons of the free market, to the communality of war and the shaky utopianism of Old Labour's green lungs, swimming-pools and bright new housing projects.</p> <p>King of the City is a very different beast. \"Believe me, pards,\" it opens, \"we're living in an age of myths and miracles.\" (Moorcock, a wily veteran, knows perfectly well, after all those years of TV evangelists and Teflon politicos, how to manage the spin that sends a sentence into reverse, like a backward-travelling bullet. \"Believe me\" means: \"Here we go again. I'm fibbing about fibbing.\") Many of the miracles and most of the myths have long since been exploited by Michael Moorcock in fables of sword and sorcery, the reality-collages of the Jerry Cornelius saga, the dark shadows of the Pyatt quartet. But the salutation at the start of this new epic is unexpected: 'pard'. Moorcock, in high Victorian conceit, likes to get the story rolling by speaking directly, as writer and performer, to his audience. His 12-part serial for DC Comics, Michael Moorcock's Multiverse, irises-in on the author's head, floating over the walls of a pink city. \"I'm Michael Moorcock. People ask where I get my ideas. Some I find here in Marrakesh.\" Next seen on a camel, the narrator aligns himself with storytellers who play \"the mythical game of time\". An occidental Haroun, he wears a broad-brimmed Indiana Jones hat. He's a role player, a trans-dimensional tourist. Hence the language. 'Pard', according to Jonathon Green's Dictionary of Slang, has no existence outside the fictionalised wild west. Moorcock is like one of those local library researchers from the bosky suburbs, from Norbury or Bexley Heath, churning out tumbleweed romances. Except that his stetson is genuine, off-highway dude store, and his Tales from the Texas Woods (1997) were published in Austin and composed in Bastrop, in a Greek revival mansion that once belonged to Joseph Sayers, a former governor of Texas.</p> <p>Such are the cultural jump-cuts of a career begun as a teenager when Moorcock hacked out Tarzan Adventures, Sexton Blake thrillers and camp-fire yarns of the purple sage. \"At the age of 17, sitting in a dark little room in south London in the late 1950s,\" he wrote in the introduction to Tales from the Texas Woods, \"I earned a wonderful living writing about an Arizona I'd never visited, about the Apache and the Comanche, about the torments of the Texas weather. I retailed bits of prairie lore to boys who had as much direct experience of Western life as I had.\" This same smooth-cheeked Kane of the Surrey hills makes a fleeting guest appearance in King of the City. The hero, Denny Dover, a paparazzo (and proud of it) visiting a Holborn publisher, bumps into a \"fat little office boy who wanted me to think he was the editor\". That's Moorcock in the days when he was dragged along to BNP-type meetings by his editor, W Howard Baker, \"just for the beer\"; and before he chucked his typewriter out of the office window and resigned, bunking off to a life of three-day novellas, quick money and lightning debts.</p> <p>Dissolve and fast-forward: now it's an age of smooth men, of judgments based on appearance. Commentators are quick to read the signs, the measured droop of Lord Bragg's handkerchief, the precise organisation of Tony Blair's latest consensus hair policy, Lord Archer's ironic, pre-penitentiary crop, the way Andrew Motion carries off his loden coat as he swirls between taxi and station platform. Julian Barnes's novels are depilated at source, fat-free. Frisking them for a Moorcockian digression, a set of cellulite-heavy parentheses, would be like checking a tub of margarine for a stray pubic hair. Smoothness, the absence of bumps and flaws and evidence of facial baroque, is everything. Dobbo was doomed as a contender by his cheek-fuzz, the grimy shadow-scurf of committee rooms and late night arguments that left crumbs in the grizzled thatch. Ken Livingstone razor-swiped his upper lip and found a loose-fitting beige suit to announce visually (for those who know that public language no longer registers) his readiness to appease, to become a mayor substitute, the political equivalent of decaf. </p> <p>Michael Moorcock resolutely defies makeover, in depth of chin duvet or in density of luxuriant, hirsute prose. The rings, the scarfs, the tattoos: they don't come off. The portraits of the author in successive novels defiantly parade his period recidivism: grey-flecked beard, shades and Lawrence of Arabia head-towel for the Saudi arms' dealer look, sun-bleached chest-curls for the stroller in Mediterranean gardens; Wild Bunch outrider, Slim Pickens or Chill Wills with badlands barbering. Moorcock has more hats than Winston Churchill. He distrusts expensive eau de Cologne newcomers with their anorexic novellas: no gravitas, no gravy. He despises the nouvelle cuisine portions served up on mid-culture chat shows. Down there, through the blistering Texas summers in the Bastrop bunker, he needs Radio 4 to keep him sane, to keep him in touch with the metropolitan discourse he walked away from. He can't abide the smoothies, the slenderness of their emotions, the tricksy little paragraphs; the lack of liver and lights, refried potatoes, heart-attack breakfasts served up in a cellar beneath Smithfield market. Moorcock's distemper remains, despite the viral assaults of life in a genetically-modified George W Bush fiefdom (fevers, sweats, steroid-regimens), genially satiric rather than venomous and bile-secreting; he targets the virtual reality spooks of Lit-Lite. The fawn jackets. The suit-bags. The shaved sentences.</p> <p>English fiction (the creative reading list), as he satirises it in King of the City, acquires an energy that it would not otherwise espouse. Here is the unreconstructed \"engine of comedy\", Rex Martin (\"the famous farting novelist\") and his diminutive son, Felix. Here is \"Jillian Burnes\", a transsexual romancer. But these knockabout cartoons are absorbed into a chiaroscuro of the forgotten, denizens of the deep recalled and re-remembered. The faces of the moment occupy less space than the invisibles, colleagues of the author, the ungrateful dead who won't leave him alone. \"Send for the resurrection men,\" says Denny Dover. \"My nobody friends are dying by the day.\" There is, within the volatile structure of King of the City, a festering tyranny of nostalgia, too many bleak afternoons spent in Kensal Green crematorium. \"Nothing,\" the narrator announces, \"is more important than talk.\"</p> <p> Reading Moorcock's novel is like eavesdropping on a remorseless, unforgiving monologue, an extraordinary seance, a memory stunt summoning all the ghosts of his long career, his busy life. The writer Jack Trevor Story is presented as a moral touchstone, the exemplar of a better period - jazz, film - scripts, novels sold three times over under different titles; the third wife, the fifth bankruptcy. These sidebars have sidebars, addenda foliate in Mandelbrotian chaos; the narrative folds back on itself, excusing and exploiting well-worn anecdotes. Moorcock sketches his version of the late Derek Raymond (aka Robin Cook) as a Soho revenant: \"Cookie was still alive in those days . . . and telling your stories back to you faster than you could recount them.\" Much of King of the City is like that, using the 'twist' to reconstitute chat rehearsed by Moorcock in the oxygen debt of endless interviews, interrogations at Fantasy conventions, comfortable reminiscences over the teacups. The story that Mai Zetterling told of her encounter with Peter Sellers and Kingsley Amis, at the time of the filming of Only Two Can Play, moves easily enough from life to fiction. 'Want to see my Aertexes?' asks the disgraceful Rex Martin, the Amis offprint. What happens is that world fits within world like a series of Russian dolls, the living and the dead, the improbable and the impossible, doubles, doppelgSngers, fetches, fabulous parasites who improve on their mundane originals. Moorcock calls the system his 'multiverse':</p> <p>\"a near-infinite nest of universes, each only marginally different from the next and only widely different when separated by millions of variants, where time is not linear but a field in which all these universes rest, creating the appearance of linearity within their own small sphere; where sometimes groups of universes exist in full knowledge and in full intercourse with the others, where 'rogue' universes can take sideways orbits, crashing through the dimensions and creating all kinds of disruptions in the delicate fabric of multiversal space-time.\"</p> <p>It reads tougher than it plays. The hook and the base narrative of King of the City are pretty straight: the story is being told in a lilac-tinted present, somewhere in the aftermath of the death of 'the People's Princess'. Denny Dover (patriotic surname, English chalk running through it like lettering in Brighton rock), ex-musician, ex-name photographer, current burnout, lucks onto a great scoop: a supposedly dead Murdoch substitute being pleasured by a lively Duchess of York clone. Nobody wants to know. Canary Wharf yawns in his face. It's the end of the road for Denny, seaside exile in West Sussex. Time spools backwards into a newsreel of childhood: \"Grey pebbles. Grey gulls. Grey skies. Grey roofs. Grey seas. The most deeply unfashionable resort in Europe with a higher rainfall than Seattle.\" The clapped out DHSS hotel filled with Balkan immigrants (think Hastings, think Margate), the 'barmy' old mum in the caravan, the assumed identity, the numb expectation of the only award the bureaucrats can offer for a lifetime's service: the Jack Trevor Story Memorial Prize (ie bankruptcy papers and an invitation to present yourself at a strip-lit office with a view of King's Cross Station). \"It's not a backwater. It's more of a septic tank.\" The necrophile damp of the South Coast, in the lull between low pressure weather fronts, doubles for the enervating heat of the accident into which Moorcock has inserted himself: Bastrop, Texas. A good place not to go out from. A self-curated mausoleum of memories: photographs, toys, magazines, William Morris wallpaper, Arts and Crafts furniture; a library of Victorian and Edwardian fiction, Stevenson, Meredith, Wells, Conrad, W Pett Ridge. Moorcock, with his sacred cats in a basket, brings up a map of London on his screen, shifting and rearranging co-ordinates until the city conforms to his reading of it. No longer able to potter out into Notting Hill to check on some detail, he is in the position that Robin Cook found himself in when, working in a vineyard in the South of France, he decided to reinvent himself as 'Derek Raymond'. Raymond's late London novels are pure wish fulfilment, breeze-block Piranesi: nightscapes salvaged from interrogation tapes, confessions to unremembered crimes, a dispersed set. The weather is borrowed from Edgar Wallace's quota quickies and the dialogue from Edgar Lustgarten's forensic reconstructions. A posthumous dream with a cast of greasy-tie filth and poetry-quoting psychopaths; autopsy flashbacks. Moorcock's memory scheme is more complex: bondings and rivalries, lovers and locations, have to be transported into an enriched present tense. There is a fearful momentum, snappy verbless sentences. Cast lists from afternoon television are interspersed with yarns and potted biographies, shards of ruin: get it all down or it will vanish for ever. And you, the author, along with it. \"There are certain areas of London that I suspect retain their integrity and beauty only by becoming invisible.\"</p> <p>So the primary storyline of King of the City, the Candide-like fable of good-hearted Denny Dover, 'goozer' and loser, swerves away as the teller of the tale, the pretend author, is elbowed aside by the exiled Moorcock - who has to whisper in his ear, correct him, put flesh on spindly, fictional bones. The case being made is not a fashionable one: paparazzo as democratic hero, champion of the mob. \"You can't invade their privacy,\" he says. \"They've sold their privacy.\" Denny talks too much (and too well) for a photographer, he's altogether too articulate. But then he's also a guitarist, colleague of Bob Calvert, connection of Hawkwind, essential element in The Deep Fix: he's done things that Moorcock has done and he's picked up some of the chat. We track Denny, son of the last Londoner hanged for murder, from his base in mythical Brookgate (part of the Huguenot leases), through a bombsite childhood reminiscent of Charles Crichton's 1947 film, Hue and Cry (a Moorcock favourite), through his love for his cousin Rosie and his spiky relationship with John Barbican Begg, developer and despoiler, global media tycoon. Revelations, betrayals, shifts of fortune, seductions, conspiracies, keep the fingers flicking over the pages. Dead on cue, after some cunningly weighted rhetorical passage, a jibe at \"Pretty Blair, the rich man's Cromwell\", the narrator will let rip with a great urban set-piece, like something out of Arthur Morrison, Jack London or George Gissing: a bare-knuckle boxing contest (\"happy unhealthy faces glowing with meaty grease, panatella smoke\"), breakfast in a Formica-table caff, a phantasmagoric binge in a Tufnell Hill windmill - which becomes an encore for the disappeared. \"You met everyone at Tubby's parties, even the recently deceased.\" The party is a requiem, an expansion of Moorcock's Bastrop workspace. You can see the walls rolling back as old comrades creep out of the shadows. \"The big round living-room was festooned with cats. They lounged on every surface, across consoles and keyboards.\" Time sags like the elasticated waistband on a pair of ancient Y-fronts. Arms are linked with Jack Trevor Story and Angela Carter; weird genealogies are disclosed. \"Angus Wilson, the novelist, who bore a striking resemblance to Margaret Rutherford, the actress who originally played Miss Marple\", is present. Also namechecked are Patricia Hodge, Simon Russell Beale, Giles Gordon (once Moorcock's literary agent), Andrea Dworkin and Iris Murdoch, who \"sat smiling into the middle-distance while Felix Martin explained the H-bomb to her\". </p> <p>What Moorcock is doing, under the permission of a work of fiction, is contriving a comprehensive encyclopedia of lost lives, uncelebrated loci, trashed cultural memory. Every casual aside accesses a John Aubrey character sketch or a history of Lilliput magazine. You don't just get the word on Tommy Steele and Charlie Watts, you get Pavli and Martin Stone, once of Mighty Baby and the Savoy Brown Blues Band. \"Martin Stone hadn't been to bed for three years. His black beret was twitching on his scalp.\" Behind Kingsley Amis and \"ice-cream suited\" JG Ballard are Alan Brien, Maeve Peake, Dave Britton and legions of the erased and discontinued: Notting Hill colons, grafters, bullshitters, pharmaceutical casualties and Fleet Street drain-rats. </p> <p>Moorcock grants us more than any novelist is required to deliver: hence the unease of several reviewers. At times the polemic surge drowns the hesitant voices of the invented characters; they have to withdraw from the action, regroup, study their documentary models. In Mother London, the author vanished into the text: the dictation, the seizure of the imagination, was absolute. There was a sense of inevitability as the past was mythologised, made new. King of the City is much more troubled. There is wild humour, tremendous events are staged, confessions broached, public clowns ridiculed, but you can hear the racing clockwork of a damaged heart. The crow's beak tapping on glass. Moorcock, in his Texas bunker, wants to bring what's on his desk - the cardboard city, the postcards of trams, the blown-up portions of the London map, the snapshots of a younger, beardless self - to life; he is compelled to tell it all, to remember everything. When he makes one of his brief returns to England, he is treated like a privileged ghost, a convalescent. Younger writers, attached to a sentimental notion of the heroic age of pulp, rumours of mass-market readership, have elected Moorcock as their King of the May (like Allen Ginsberg in dark ages Prague). A Prince of Thieves. It's a courtesy title: see Moorcock, in the publicity shot for the collection britpulp!, on his throne under the railway arches, a scarfed and hatted Fagin surrounded by smooth-cheeked, bare-headed acolytes - Tony White, Stewart Home, Steve Aylett, Steve Beard, China Mieville. What you are getting is a frame from Moorcock's comic strip, The Metatemporal Detective, showing a traditional 'hell's kitchen' where 'Old Man Smith', the piratical ruler of the underworld, lounges on a raised chair to receive his tributes. Only in the labyrinth of fiction is Moorcock recognised as king of the city. \"The air has an amniotic taste.\" Memory is most powerfully provoked by smell and taste. Food, more than the drink, drugs and music which act as temporal markers in the centrifugal plot, anchors narrative to place. Without those vein-clogging breakfasts, Denny Dover was lost - and his creator with him. \"They were willing me into non-existence,\" he acknowledged. The older we get, the less powerful our bite, the more our reveries shift from sexual anticipation to remembered blow-outs, over-spilling plates, vinegar-brown sauces. Food and weather define the true Brookgate man, the ability to survive them, to nurture a specially adapted bio-system on draughts of bad air. \"Damp weather's food and drink to a Londoner like me,\" Denny announces. \"Grey weather's our natural habitat.\" In the depth of a lightless winter, a suicide's Christmas, cut off lovers and friends, \"speedballing to the Queen's Speech\", Moorcock's paparazzo recovers his humanity by drifting down to his favourite caff, Ray's, a time-warp oasis in Snatcher's Island, off Drury Lane. A bolthole discoverable only by strict adherence to the Arthur Machen rules of psychogeographic meandering.</p> <p>\"Ray's was a gourmet greasy spoon. He had at least a dozen distinctive kinds of grease, every one of them delicious. And the All-Day Full English had most of them on it - perfect free-range fried eggs, crisp fried bread, best back bacon, tomatoes straight off the vine, fresh portobello mushrooms, Savoy black pudding sent specially from Manchester, tasty baked beans, Fourmantel's Carlisle pork bangers, Trevithick's Cornish butter. If you can think of it, Ray had it. These days he'd be in every restaurant guide in the world, but that was before a mania for populism blew the whistle on our secrets. The only people who went to Ray's were people you didn't mind rubbing shoulders with.\"</p> <p>Ray's steamy caff provokes a lascivious taxonomy of Bunter comforts, a memory sluice. The great and the good are approvingly ticked off as they stagger into Moorcock's survival module, the ark he is preparing for burial as a millennial tribute: Ronnie Scott, Humphrey Lyttelton, Johnny Dankworth, the actor Freddie Earlle. \"Jack Trevor Story introduced me to Billy Strayhorn.\" Names recalled are virtues recovered. For long stretches, King of the City becomes a back number of Spotlight, a vagrant's overcoat stitched from yellowed copies of the Radio Times. \"I value the approval of the forgotten dead over the respect of the living.\" Denny Dover and his cousin Rosie, one of the near-incestuous bondings that have always been a part of Moorcock's novels, link souls over a plate of \"Sharpes Alley bloodworms and taters\". In Moorcock's mythical city, there are only initiates and outsiders, bloodworm-fanciers and bloodless vegans. \"To get their flavour, the worms had to be made from fresh pig's blood, which meant the pig was being hung and bled somewhere nearby, completely at odds with every city law since the beginning of the world.\"</p> <p> Licking the fatty residue from its beard, King of the City is nostalgic about nostalgia, angry about the mindless greed of developers and bingeing asset-strippers, heritage pirates; the dead rhetoric in the mouths of politicians (\"Tony Blurr and his Sultans of Spin\"). Moorcock champions names who are no longer there, authors he can't rescue from the swamp of oblivion. They're not in the book, in Margaret Drabble's latest edition of the Oxford Companion to English Literature: no Gerald Kersh, Kyril Bonfiglioli, M John Harrison, James Sallis, Keith Roberts, Derek Raymond, Harlan Ellison. No Jack Trevor Story. Moorcock is there. He's included, quite generously summarised, and not just as a \"science-fiction writer of the 1960s\". But how strange it must feel, to be allowed into the club, while most of your colleagues and former collaborators, the characters around whom so much of your work has been constructed, lead an extra-curricular existence, banished from the official canon. No wonder Moorcock, one of the few novelists with a platinum disc (from his days with Hawkwind), is so uncomfortable in an age of air guitarists: the Blair/ Clinton wild boys of the bathroom mirror. Mime masters. Party saxophonists. Purveyors of the rock and roll wannabe novel, the novel written by the rock star's best chum.</p> <p>So who is the King of the City? The ambiguities of that title haunt the novel. Denny Dover is no Christopher Walken skull-cruncher, steaming his way through an Abel Ferrara revenger's tale. The global magnate, John Barbican Begg, jumps off Tower Bridge (a faked suicide) during the millennial come-back gig at the book's climax. And Moorcock, despite obvious challenges to other pretenders to the title (the literary equivalent to his bare-knuckle prizefights), is too sane to want that hollow honour. He's had his skirmishes, his turf wars with the Amis franchise. (He shadowed Kingsley for much of his career, born in the same manor, knowing so well what had to be left behind. He'd be shocked, I think, if he read Martin Amis's memoir, Experience, to find the old devil catching his second wind with a campari and soda, Moorcock's own non-drink drink. Moorcock's fictional characters brace themselves with a pint of Ackroyd's mild.) But, once again, the timing of publication has been awkward, setting King of the City (a secret history made of minute particulars, submerged elegies) alongside Peter Ackroyd's London: The Biography.</p> <p> Ackroyd's vigorous bestseller ends with the defeat of chaos, with protest and riot tamed. Moorcock is an unreconstructed populist, his sympathies always with the rioters at the prison gates: \"My old, sweet, darling mob. My good old London mob.\" As his invented (or reinvented) revenants and anonymous extras vanish from Tower Bridge, a crush of real literary masks, PR folk, media flotsam, Dome apologists brush past them, waving their invitation cards for the launch of Ackroyd's heritage blockbuster. If they turn to gaze down at the black waters of the Thames, they won't find the drowning Begg. King of the City is a book they haven't read, not yet. There weren't any wine-sipping parties for Moorcock's London novel and the exiled author couldn't make it for the tour. The budget went on posters. And now the bailiffs and the fiscal bounty-hunters are on his case. \"Finances were so bad that cash machines would set off their own alarms if I so much as glanced at them. I needed somewhere to hide for a while.\" Sometimes, when fly-pitchers rip off a pad of back numbers on Commercial Street, a bit of Moorcock's eye, or a clump of hair, bursts through the latest one-shot wonder's marble cheek. The message is still out there: 'Vote.' Or, better still, read, find out just what you've been missing.</p> <p>\u0095 To read more online essays from the current edition of the London Review of Books visit the <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/\">LRB</a>.

Scribner, reissue, 496 pp., \u00a36.99, 8 May, 0 684 86141 0 Buy it at BOL Around the time of the London mayoral election, that stupendous non-event in the calendar of civic discourse, posters appeared out of nowhere with the head of a man who wasn't quite Frank Dobson. There was nothing peevish or pop-eyed about this citizen. The shirt was open-necked. The tilted look was watchful, eyes narrowed against bright light: a non-combatant shocked to find himself exposed on the hustings. No Londoner, according to the spin-doctors, is ever going to vote for a beard. The candidate, a Father Christmas in civvies, knows that better than anyone, knows he's on a loser, but it hasn't dowsed his fire. Actually, this fly-pitched outlaw, spotted on the side of a telephone junction box outside Toynbee Hall, on Commercial Street in Whitechapel, had been got up to look like a charity case, or a Wanted poster. Dead or alive. 'Vote Michael Moorcock', it said. 'King of the City'. King of the City, a hefty London novel, character-packed, busy with competing narratives (confessing, denouncing, celebrating, plea-bargaining for its own sanity), was being punted by its publicists as \"the long-awaited sequel to a Whitbread Prize shortlisted book Mother London\". Clearly, it is nothing of the sort. Prequel, coda, kissing cousin? Arguably. Mother London required no sequel. It could have used some of the fortuitous timing that allows a book to mop up well-deserved honours and achieve a word-of-mouth readership that keeps it running for years. Unfortunately, Mother London was swamped by the extra-literary controversies surrounding The Satanic Verses. One strand in Salman Rushdie's novel, necessarily under-discussed, was Brick Lane-based, a Bollywood derive through the territory where I came across Moorcock's King of the City poster. Both authors have moved on. Rushdie, seduced by the high-definition celebrity culture of New York, new smells, brighter lights, has denounced his old midden for its failure to fire his imagination, but Moorcock, in whatever exile he finds himself, returns obsessively to his dream-source, the city of his birth. Mother London, a book whose reputation continued to grow as it became harder to find, as paperbacks disappeared and hardbacks drifted into charity shops, has now been reissued. Its status as one of the novels by which a substantial portion of London memory can be recovered is assured. The book is a great, humane document, written at a time when the old liberties were under threat and therefore more alive than ever. Mother London pivoted on the Blitz, on psychic damage, small urban miracles worked by human affection, a woman walking out of the fire with a newborn baby in her arms. The novel's trajectory of hurt runs from Thatcher's denial of the concept of society, the unappeased demons of the free market, to the communality of war and the shaky utopianism of Old Labour's green lungs, swimming-pools and bright new housing projects. King of the City is a very different beast. \"Believe me, pards,\" it opens, \"we're living in an age of myths and miracles.\" (Moorcock, a wily veteran, knows perfectly well, after all those years of TV evangelists and Teflon politicos, how to manage the spin that sends a sentence into reverse, like a backward-travelling bullet. \"Believe me\" means: \"Here we go again. I'm fibbing about fibbing.\") Many of the miracles and most of the myths have long since been exploited by Michael Moorcock in fables of sword and sorcery, the reality-collages of the Jerry Cornelius saga, the dark shadows of the Pyatt quartet. But the salutation at the start of this new epic is unexpected: 'pard'. Moorcock, in high Victorian conceit, likes to get the story rolling by speaking directly, as writer and performer, to his audience. His 12-part serial for DC Comics, Michael Moorcock's Multiverse, irises-in on the author's head, floating over the walls of a pink city. \"I'm Michael Moorcock. People ask where I get my ideas. Some I find here in Marrakesh.\" Next seen on a camel, the narrator aligns himself with storytellers who play \"the mythical game of time\". An occidental Haroun, he wears a broad-brimmed Indiana Jones hat. He's a role player, a trans-dimensional tourist. Hence the language. 'Pard', according to Jonathon Green's Dictionary of Slang, has no existence outside the fictionalised wild west. Moorcock is like one of those local library researchers from the bosky suburbs, from Norbury or Bexley Heath, churning out tumbleweed romances. Except that his stetson is genuine, off-highway dude store, and his Tales from the Texas Woods (1997) were published in Austin and composed in Bastrop, in a Greek revival mansion that once belonged to Joseph Sayers, a former governor of Texas. Such are the cultural jump-cuts of a career begun as a teenager when Moorcock hacked out Tarzan Adventures, Sexton Blake thrillers and camp-fire yarns of the purple sage. \"At the age of 17, sitting in a dark little room in south London in the late 1950s,\" he wrote in the introduction to Tales from the Texas Woods, \"I earned a wonderful living writing about an Arizona I'd never visited, about the Apache and the Comanche, about the torments of the Texas weather. I retailed bits of prairie lore to boys who had as much direct experience of Western life as I had.\" This same smooth-cheeked Kane of the Surrey hills makes a fleeting guest appearance in King of the City. The hero, Denny Dover, a paparazzo (and proud of it) visiting a Holborn publisher, bumps into a \"fat little office boy who wanted me to think he was the editor\". That's Moorcock in the days when he was dragged along to BNP-type meetings by his editor, W Howard Baker, \"just for the beer\"; and before he chucked his typewriter out of the office window and resigned, bunking off to a life of three-day novellas, quick money and lightning debts. Dissolve and fast-forward: now it's an age of smooth men, of judgments based on appearance. Commentators are quick to read the signs, the measured droop of Lord Bragg's handkerchief, the precise organisation of Tony Blair's latest consensus hair policy, Lord Archer's ironic, pre-penitentiary crop, the way Andrew Motion carries off his loden coat as he swirls between taxi and station platform. Julian Barnes's novels are depilated at source, fat-free. Frisking them for a Moorcockian digression, a set of cellulite-heavy parentheses, would be like checking a tub of margarine for a stray pubic hair. Smoothness, the absence of bumps and flaws and evidence of facial baroque, is everything. Dobbo was doomed as a contender by his cheek-fuzz, the grimy shadow-scurf of committee rooms and late night arguments that left crumbs in the grizzled thatch. Ken Livingstone razor-swiped his upper lip and found a loose-fitting beige suit to announce visually (for those who know that public language no longer registers) his readiness to appease, to become a mayor substitute, the political equivalent of decaf. Michael Moorcock resolutely defies makeover, in depth of chin duvet or in density of luxuriant, hirsute prose. The rings, the scarfs, the tattoos: they don't come off. The portraits of the author in successive novels defiantly parade his period recidivism: grey-flecked beard, shades and Lawrence of Arabia head-towel for the Saudi arms' dealer look, sun-bleached chest-curls for the stroller in Mediterranean gardens; Wild Bunch outrider, Slim Pickens or Chill Wills with badlands barbering. Moorcock has more hats than Winston Churchill. He distrusts expensive eau de Cologne newcomers with their anorexic novellas: no gravitas, no gravy. He despises the nouvelle cuisine portions served up on mid-culture chat shows. Down there, through the blistering Texas summers in the Bastrop bunker, he needs Radio 4 to keep him sane, to keep him in touch with the metropolitan discourse he walked away from. He can't abide the smoothies, the slenderness of their emotions, the tricksy little paragraphs; the lack of liver and lights, refried potatoes, heart-attack breakfasts served up in a cellar beneath Smithfield market. Moorcock's distemper remains, despite the viral assaults of life in a genetically-modified George W Bush fiefdom (fevers, sweats, steroid-regimens), genially satiric rather than venomous and bile-secreting; he targets the virtual reality spooks of Lit-Lite. The fawn jackets. The suit-bags. The shaved sentences. English fiction (the creative reading list), as he satirises it in King of the City, acquires an energy that it would not otherwise espouse. Here is the unreconstructed \"engine of comedy\", Rex Martin (\"the famous farting novelist\") and his diminutive son, Felix. Here is \"Jillian Burnes\", a transsexual romancer. But these knockabout cartoons are absorbed into a chiaroscuro of the forgotten, denizens of the deep recalled and re-remembered. The faces of the moment occupy less space than the invisibles, colleagues of the author, the ungrateful dead who won't leave him alone. \"Send for the resurrection men,\" says Denny Dover. \"My nobody friends are dying by the day.\" There is, within the volatile structure of King of the City, a festering tyranny of nostalgia, too many bleak afternoons spent in Kensal Green crematorium. \"Nothing,\" the narrator announces, \"is more important than talk.\" Reading Moorcock's novel is like eavesdropping on a remorseless, unforgiving monologue, an extraordinary seance, a memory stunt summoning all the ghosts of his long career, his busy life. The writer Jack Trevor Story is presented as a moral touchstone, the exemplar of a better period - jazz, film - scripts, novels sold three times over under different titles; the third wife, the fifth bankruptcy. These sidebars have sidebars, addenda foliate in Mandelbrotian chaos; the narrative folds back on itself, excusing and exploiting well-worn anecdotes. Moorcock sketches his version of the late Derek Raymond (aka Robin Cook) as a Soho revenant: \"Cookie was still alive in those days . . . and telling your stories back to you faster than you could recount them.\" Much of King of the City is like that, using the 'twist' to reconstitute chat rehearsed by Moorcock in the oxygen debt of endless interviews, interrogations at Fantasy conventions, comfortable reminiscences over the teacups. The story that Mai Zetterling told of her encounter with Peter Sellers and Kingsley Amis, at the time of the filming of Only Two Can Play, moves easily enough from life to fiction. 'Want to see my Aertexes?' asks the disgraceful Rex Martin, the Amis offprint. What happens is that world fits within world like a series of Russian dolls, the living and the dead, the improbable and the impossible, doubles, doppelgSngers, fetches, fabulous parasites who improve on their mundane originals. Moorcock calls the system his 'multiverse': \"a near-infinite nest of universes, each only marginally different from the next and only widely different when separated by millions of variants, where time is not linear but a field in which all these universes rest, creating the appearance of linearity within their own small sphere; where sometimes groups of universes exist in full knowledge and in full intercourse with the others, where 'rogue' universes can take sideways orbits, crashing through the dimensions and creating all kinds of disruptions in the delicate fabric of multiversal space-time.\" It reads tougher than it plays. The hook and the base narrative of King of the City are pretty straight: the story is being told in a lilac-tinted present, somewhere in the aftermath of the death of 'the People's Princess'. Denny Dover (patriotic surname, English chalk running through it like lettering in Brighton rock), ex-musician, ex-name photographer, current burnout, lucks onto a great scoop: a supposedly dead Murdoch substitute being pleasured by a lively Duchess of York clone. Nobody wants to know. Canary Wharf yawns in his face. It's the end of the road for Denny, seaside exile in West Sussex. Time spools backwards into a newsreel of childhood: \"Grey pebbles. Grey gulls. Grey skies. Grey roofs. Grey seas. The most deeply unfashionable resort in Europe with a higher rainfall than Seattle.\" The clapped out DHSS hotel filled with Balkan immigrants (think Hastings, think Margate), the 'barmy' old mum in the caravan, the assumed identity, the numb expectation of the only award the bureaucrats can offer for a lifetime's service: the Jack Trevor Story Memorial Prize (ie bankruptcy papers and an invitation to present yourself at a strip-lit office with a view of King's Cross Station). \"It's not a backwater. It's more of a septic tank.\" The necrophile damp of the South Coast, in the lull between low pressure weather fronts, doubles for the enervating heat of the accident into which Moorcock has inserted himself: Bastrop, Texas. A good place not to go out from. A self-curated mausoleum of memories: photographs, toys, magazines, William Morris wallpaper, Arts and Crafts furniture; a library of Victorian and Edwardian fiction, Stevenson, Meredith, Wells, Conrad, W Pett Ridge. Moorcock, with his sacred cats in a basket, brings up a map of London on his screen, shifting and rearranging co-ordinates until the city conforms to his reading of it. No longer able to potter out into Notting Hill to check on some detail, he is in the position that Robin Cook found himself in when, working in a vineyard in the South of France, he decided to reinvent himself as 'Derek Raymond'. Raymond's late London novels are pure wish fulfilment, breeze-block Piranesi: nightscapes salvaged from interrogation tapes, confessions to unremembered crimes, a dispersed set. The weather is borrowed from Edgar Wallace's quota quickies and the dialogue from Edgar Lustgarten's forensic reconstructions. A posthumous dream with a cast of greasy-tie filth and poetry-quoting psychopaths; autopsy flashbacks. Moorcock's memory scheme is more complex: bondings and rivalries, lovers and locations, have to be transported into an enriched present tense. There is a fearful momentum, snappy verbless sentences. Cast lists from afternoon television are interspersed with yarns and potted biographies, shards of ruin: get it all down or it will vanish for ever. And you, the author, along with it. \"There are certain areas of London that I suspect retain their integrity and beauty only by becoming invisible.\" So the primary storyline of King of the City, the Candide-like fable of good-hearted Denny Dover, 'goozer' and loser, swerves away as the teller of the tale, the pretend author, is elbowed aside by the exiled Moorcock - who has to whisper in his ear, correct him, put flesh on spindly, fictional bones. The case being made is not a fashionable one: paparazzo as democratic hero, champion of the mob. \"You can't invade their privacy,\" he says. \"They've sold their privacy.\" Denny talks too much (and too well) for a photographer, he's altogether too articulate. But then he's also a guitarist, colleague of Bob Calvert, connection of Hawkwind, essential element in The Deep Fix: he's done things that Moorcock has done and he's picked up some of the chat. We track Denny, son of the last Londoner hanged for murder, from his base in mythical Brookgate (part of the Huguenot leases), through a bombsite childhood reminiscent of Charles Crichton's 1947 film, Hue and Cry (a Moorcock favourite), through his love for his cousin Rosie and his spiky relationship with John Barbican Begg, developer and despoiler, global media tycoon. Revelations, betrayals, shifts of fortune, seductions, conspiracies, keep the fingers flicking over the pages. Dead on cue, after some cunningly weighted rhetorical passage, a jibe at \"Pretty Blair, the rich man's Cromwell\", the narrator will let rip with a great urban set-piece, like something out of Arthur Morrison, Jack London or George Gissing: a bare-knuckle boxing contest (\"happy unhealthy faces glowing with meaty grease, panatella smoke\"), breakfast in a Formica-table caff, a phantasmagoric binge in a Tufnell Hill windmill - which becomes an encore for the disappeared. \"You met everyone at Tubby's parties, even the recently deceased.\" The party is a requiem, an expansion of Moorcock's Bastrop workspace. You can see the walls rolling back as old comrades creep out of the shadows. \"The big round living-room was festooned with cats. They lounged on every surface, across consoles and keyboards.\" Time sags like the elasticated waistband on a pair of ancient Y-fronts. Arms are linked with Jack Trevor Story and Angela Carter; weird genealogies are disclosed. \"Angus Wilson, the novelist, who bore a striking resemblance to Margaret Rutherford, the actress who originally played Miss Marple\", is present. Also namechecked are Patricia Hodge, Simon Russell Beale, Giles Gordon (once Moorcock's literary agent), Andrea Dworkin and Iris Murdoch, who \"sat smiling into the middle-distance while Felix Martin explained the H-bomb to her\". What Moorcock is doing, under the permission of a work of fiction, is contriving a comprehensive encyclopedia of lost lives, uncelebrated loci, trashed cultural memory. Every casual aside accesses a John Aubrey character sketch or a history of Lilliput magazine. You don't just get the word on Tommy Steele and Charlie Watts, you get Pavli and Martin Stone, once of Mighty Baby and the Savoy Brown Blues Band. \"Martin Stone hadn't been to bed for three years. His black beret was twitching on his scalp.\" Behind Kingsley Amis and \"ice-cream suited\" JG Ballard are Alan Brien, Maeve Peake, Dave Britton and legions of the erased and discontinued: Notting Hill colons, grafters, bullshitters, pharmaceutical casualties and Fleet Street drain-rats. Moorcock grants us more than any novelist is required to deliver: hence the unease of several reviewers. At times the polemic surge drowns the hesitant voices of the invented characters; they have to withdraw from the action, regroup, study their documentary models. In Mother London, the author vanished into the text: the dictation, the seizure of the imagination, was absolute. There was a sense of inevitability as the past was mythologised, made new. King of the City is much more troubled. There is wild humour, tremendous events are staged, confessions broached, public clowns ridiculed, but you can hear the racing clockwork of a damaged heart. The crow's beak tapping on glass.

Only in the labyrinth of fiction is Moorcock recognised as king of the city. \"The air has an amniotic taste.\" Memory is most powerfully provoked by smell and taste. Food, more than the drink, drugs and music which act as temporal markers in the centrifugal plot, anchors narrative to place. Without those vein-clogging breakfasts, Denny Dover was lost - and his creator with him. \"They were willing me into non-existence,\" he acknowledged. The older we get, the less powerful our bite, the more our reveries shift from sexual anticipation to remembered blow-outs, over-spilling plates, vinegar-brown sauces. Food and weather define the true Brookgate man, the ability to survive them, to nurture a specially adapted bio-system on draughts of bad air. \"Damp weather's food and drink to a Londoner like me,\" Denny announces. \"Grey weather's our natural habitat.\" In the depth of a lightless winter, a suicide's Christmas, cut off lovers and friends, \"speedballing to the Queen's Speech\", Moorcock's paparazzo recovers his humanity by drifting down to his favourite caff, Ray's, a time-warp oasis in Snatcher's Island, off Drury Lane. A bolthole discoverable only by strict adherence to the Arthur Machen rules of psychogeographic meandering. \"Ray's was a gourmet greasy spoon. He had at least a dozen distinctive kinds of grease, every one of them delicious. And the All-Day Full English had most of them on it - perfect free-range fried eggs, crisp fried bread, best back bacon, tomatoes straight off the vine, fresh portobello mushrooms, Savoy black pudding sent specially from Manchester, tasty baked beans, Fourmantel's Carlisle pork bangers, Trevithick's Cornish butter. If you can think of it, Ray had it. These days he'd be in every restaurant guide in the world, but that was before a mania for populism blew the whistle on our secrets. The only people who went to Ray's were people you didn't mind rubbing shoulders with.\" Ray's steamy caff provokes a lascivious taxonomy of Bunter comforts, a memory sluice. The great and the good are approvingly ticked off as they stagger into Moorcock's survival module, the ark he is preparing for burial as a millennial tribute: Ronnie Scott, Humphrey Lyttelton, Johnny Dankworth, the actor Freddie Earlle. \"Jack Trevor Story introduced me to Billy Strayhorn.\" Names recalled are virtues recovered. For long stretches, King of the City becomes a back number of Spotlight, a vagrant's overcoat stitched from yellowed copies of the Radio Times. \"I value the approval of the forgotten dead over the respect of the living.\" Denny Dover and his cousin Rosie, one of the near-incestuous bondings that have always been a part of Moorcock's novels, link souls over a plate of \"Sharpes Alley bloodworms and taters\". In Moorcock's mythical city, there are only initiates and outsiders, bloodworm-fanciers and bloodless vegans. \"To get their flavour, the worms had to be made from fresh pig's blood, which meant the pig was being hung and bled somewhere nearby, completely at odds with every city law since the beginning of the world.\" Licking the fatty residue from its beard, King of the City is nostalgic about nostalgia, angry about the mindless greed of developers and bingeing asset-strippers, heritage pirates; the dead rhetoric in the mouths of politicians (\"Tony Blurr and his Sultans of Spin\"). Moorcock champions names who are no longer there, authors he can't rescue from the swamp of oblivion. They're not in the book, in Margaret Drabble's latest edition of the Oxford Companion to English Literature: no Gerald Kersh, Kyril Bonfiglioli, M John Harrison, James Sallis, Keith Roberts, Derek Raymond, Harlan Ellison. No Jack Trevor Story. Moorcock is there. He's included, quite generously summarised, and not just as a \"science-fiction writer of the 1960s\". But how strange it must feel, to be allowed into the club, while most of your colleagues and former collaborators, the characters around whom so much of your work has been constructed, lead an extra-curricular existence, banished from the official canon. No wonder Moorcock, one of the few novelists with a platinum disc (from his days with Hawkwind), is so uncomfortable in an age of air guitarists: the Blair/ Clinton wild boys of the bathroom mirror. Mime masters. Party saxophonists. Purveyors of the rock and roll wannabe novel, the novel written by the rock star's best chum. So who is the King of the City? The ambiguities of that title haunt the novel. Denny Dover is no Christopher Walken skull-cruncher, steaming his way through an Abel Ferrara revenger's tale. The global magnate, John Barbican Begg, jumps off Tower Bridge (a faked suicide) during the millennial come-back gig at the book's climax. And Moorcock, despite obvious challenges to other pretenders to the title (the literary equivalent to his bare-knuckle prizefights), is too sane to want that hollow honour. He's had his skirmishes, his turf wars with the Amis franchise. (He shadowed Kingsley for much of his career, born in the same manor, knowing so well what had to be left behind. He'd be shocked, I think, if he read Martin Amis's memoir, Experience, to find the old devil catching his second wind with a campari and soda, Moorcock's own non-drink drink. Moorcock's fictional characters brace themselves with a pint of Ackroyd's mild.) But, once again, the timing of publication has been awkward, setting King of the City (a secret history made of minute particulars, submerged elegies) alongside Peter Ackroyd's London: The Biography. Ackroyd's vigorous bestseller ends with the defeat of chaos, with protest and riot tamed. Moorcock is an unreconstructed populist, his sympathies always with the rioters at the prison gates: \"My old, sweet, darling mob. My good old London mob.\" As his invented (or reinvented) revenants and anonymous extras vanish from Tower Bridge, a crush of real literary masks, PR folk, media flotsam, Dome apologists brush past them, waving their invitation cards for the launch of Ackroyd's heritage blockbuster. If they turn to gaze down at the black waters of the Thames, they won't find the drowning Begg. King of the City is a book they haven't read, not yet. There weren't any wine-sipping parties for Moorcock's London novel and the exiled author couldn't make it for the tour. The budget went on posters. And now the bailiffs and the fiscal bounty-hunters are on his case. \"Finances were so bad that cash machines would set off their own alarms if I so much as glanced at them. I needed somewhere to hide for a while.\" Sometimes, when fly-pitchers rip off a pad of back numbers on Commercial Street, a bit of Moorcock's eye, or a clump of hair, bursts through the latest one-shot wonder's marble cheek. The message is still out there: 'Vote.' Or, better still, read, find out just what you've been missing. \u0095 To read more online essays from the current edition of the London Review of Books visit the LRB.

      "body": "<p>United News and Media is set to sell its stakes in ITN and Channel 5 following the disposal of the Express newspapers.</p> <p>A source close to the main shareholder in Channel 5, RTL, said they have already had informal discussions with United about taking complete control of the TV broadcaster.</p> <p>\"Following the sale of the Express titles, the pressure is on United to dispose of its stake. At some point there will have to be a face-to-face negotiation about it,\" said the source.</p> <p>Insiders, however, say that United is holding out for a higher price and is using delay tactics to gain the upper hand in negotiations. One source said it is refusing to sanction a \u00a360m increase in Channel 5's budget because it knows this will stymie RTL's plans for the channel.</p> <p>RTL indicated as far back as August that it wanted to turn the channel's image around, by investing in more high quality programming. Today executives at the Luxembourg-based company said they would not pay a \"silly price\" for United's holding.</p> <p>The RTL source said wrangles over the budget increase \"may complicate the situation\".</p> <p>The problem for RTL is that United is in no rush to sell its stake. It is understood that Lord Hollick is happy with the revenue from his stake in Channel 5, and does not find it as much of a drag on management resources as the Express newspapers.</p> <p>Meanwhile, an industry source also confirmed that United is seriously considering the sale of its ITN stake when the company floats next year. \"When ITN is floated there will be an opportunity for an orderly sale of the stake. United are unlikely to exit before the float,\" added the source.</p> <p>ITN is owned by United, Reuters news service, the Daily Mail and General Trust, and ITV giants Carlton Communications and Granada Media. The companies own 20% each of ITN, which is to be floated in order to pay for ambitious international expansion and new media plans.</p> <p>United yesterday sold the Express group to publishing tycoon Richard Desmond for \u00a3125m. The group intends to transform into a business information group, leaving a 20% holding in the ITN news service and a 35% stake in Channel 5 as its only remaining media interests.</p>",

      "bodyText": "United News and Media is set to sell its stakes in ITN and Channel 5 following the disposal of the Express newspapers. A source close to the main shareholder in Channel 5, RTL, said they have already had informal discussions with United about taking complete control of the TV broadcaster. \"Following the sale of the Express titles, the pressure is on United to dispose of its stake. At some point there will have to be a face-to-face negotiation about it,\" said the source. Insiders, however, say that United is holding out for a higher price and is using delay tactics to gain the upper hand in negotiations. One source said it is refusing to sanction a \u00a360m increase in Channel 5's budget because it knows this will stymie RTL's plans for the channel. RTL indicated as far back as August that it wanted to turn the channel's image around, by investing in more high quality programming. Today executives at the Luxembourg-based company said they would not pay a \"silly price\" for United's holding. The RTL source said wrangles over the budget increase \"may complicate the situation\". The problem for RTL is that United is in no rush to sell its stake. It is understood that Lord Hollick is happy with the revenue from his stake in Channel 5, and does not find it as much of a drag on management resources as the Express newspapers. Meanwhile, an industry source also confirmed that United is seriously considering the sale of its ITN stake when the company floats next year. \"When ITN is floated there will be an opportunity for an orderly sale of the stake. United are unlikely to exit before the float,\" added the source. ITN is owned by United, Reuters news service, the Daily Mail and General Trust, and ITV giants Carlton Communications and Granada Media. The companies own 20% each of ITN, which is to be floated in order to pay for ambitious international expansion and new media plans. United yesterday sold the Express group to publishing tycoon Richard Desmond for \u00a3125m. The group intends to transform into a business information group, leaving a 20% holding in the ITN news service and a 35% stake in Channel 5 as its only remaining media interests.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Wherever the extraordinary career of Richard Desmond has taken him, strange tales have never been far behind. There was the story of the public relations executive, late for a meeting, who was instructed to spend the rest of it in a cupboard; the out-of-favour accountant driven by Desmond's chauffeur to a godforsaken Docklands street and required to walk all the way home. There was the former employee who claimed he had been pistol-whipped by mobsters when Desmond's (entirely legitimate) business ventures threatened the New York Mafia's. </p> <p>But the rumour that began to gain ground in Fleet Street on Tuesday afternoon was, by any measure, the strangest yet. The multimillionaire owner of the Northern &amp; Shell empire, proprietor of OK! magazine - not to mention a vigorous stable of particularly British pornographic magazines, including Nude Wives, Big Ones, Asian Babes and 40 Plus - appeared to be in the running to buy Express Newspapers, owners of the Daily Express, the Sunday Express, and the Daily Star. By yesterday afternoon, it was confirmed: the paper of Lord Beaverbrook had been sold for \u00a3125m - in cash - to a former operator of sex chatlines from north London. </p> <p>For Express journalists - who mournfully unfurled a banner reading \"sold\" over their home newsdesk yesterday - it was a shock. (\"You can only imagine what they must be making of this down at the Daily Mail,\" one senior Express journalist commented ruefully.) For the Daily Star, it was better news than they could have dreamed of. But for the 48-year-old Desmond, it was something far more - the beginning of the realisation of a dream that his celebrity friends, his flash cars and his millions could never have brought: a shot at real respectability. </p> <p>The tycoon makes sure he lives a life commensurate with his personal worth of \u00a3150m and his placing of 44 in this year's Sunday Times Rich List. There is the grand house, just off - if not technically on - London's most ostentatious Millionaire's Row, The Bishop's Avenue, shared with his wife Janet (\"a fantastic marriage,\" friends say) and 11-year-old son Robert; the chauffeur-driven Bentley with the personalised number plate, and the Ferrari; the liveried butler in his vast Docklands office. </p> <p>Friends include Jeremy Beadle, the celebrity columnist Richard Littlejohn and Gerald Ronson, the property magnate imprisoned for his involvement in the Guinness scandal, and Posh Spice Victoria Beckham: he once gave 87 staff \u00a310 each to buy copies of her single which she then, obligingly, autographed. \"Desmond,\" as one commentator expressed it, \"is the man for whom the age of celebrity was invented.\" </p> <p>His energetically hands-on proprietorship of OK! built the celebrity-worshipping glossy into a serious rival to Hello!, an effort which saw the photographic rights to the wedding of Victoria and David Beckham purchased for \u00a31m, with \u00a3100,000 lavished on security arrangements to keep rival paparazzi away. </p> <p>He was the only man in Britain who dared publish the photos of Prince William during his 10-week expedition in Chile, a decision which saw him censured by the Press Complaints Commission. Hello!'s dominance of the market seemed impregnable, but Desmond's willingness to get out his wallet enabled him to close the gap, and the latest figures show Hello! selling 458,683 copies a week against OK!'s 456,162. </p> <p>But there is another side to Desmond - the foul-mouthed Londoner who has reportedly reduced staff to tears and had his reputation mangled as a result of endless, unsubstantiated tales of gangsters on his tail and workers driven mad with fear of reprisals from his enemies. He shrugs such stories off. David Sullivan, his peer in the soft porn industry as publisher of the Sport newspapers, sounds as though he could illuminate the matter, but won't. \"He sues,\" he explains. </p> <p>Kelvin MacKenzie, former editor of the Sun, is a little more forthcoming. \"He's very direct, he's very tough, he swears a lot. They'll get quite a culture shock at the Express when he turns up,\" he says. \"They'll never have met anyone like him. But he's a winner. Of all the people who were bidding for the Express he would be top of my list in terms of making it work. He's very driven, very editorially led and a very clever guy.\" </p> <p>But Desmond still longs to be admitted to the establishment. Though skilful at luring the great and the good to lunch - or, in the case of the Duke of Edinburgh, to open Northern &amp; Shell's new offices in the early 90s - his longing is unabated. \"If there's a weakness in his character,\" says Max Clifford, the public relations maestro who has had his fair share of dealings with Desmond on OK! magazine, \"it's that he wants to be respected, something I'd never be bothered about. I suspect he would love a knighthood.\" </p> <p>Though ostensibly relaxed about his porn holdings - \"If you start being moralistic, you should start on about sweets being bad for children,\" he once explained - he hates the soft-porn label, Clifford says. \"He would far rather be called a newspaper magnate.\" The titles, worth \u00a31m, are dealt with through a sister company, Portland Investments, and journalists who describe him as a porn baron are assiduously pursued. On his office wall is a profile from the Sunday Times, which he is said to cherish because it refers to him as a businessman, not a porn merchant. </p> <p>An active philanthropist, Desmond has reportedly given away \u00a35m in the last 20 years, notably to the Federation of Boys' Clubs. It is another bid for elusive respectability, says one friend: \"Richard wants to be accepted. He knows how people think of him. At best, he's viewed as a rough diamond. He wants to be accepted. He has successfully launched one of the top selling magazines, but like so many self-made successful people in British society, he can't understand why his success brings him nothing but insults. The trouble with him is that his personal manner makes him unacceptable. It brings out what hint of snobbery there is left in Britain.\" </p> <p>The \"personal manner\" is certainly legendary. At the infamous wedding of Anthea Turner and Grant Bovey in August - to which OK! had bought the rights - one eyewitness says: \"He was making sure the guests who got their cameras out taking family pictures were doing just that. He got quite aerated and had a word with several of the people in charge. The trouble is that when you add the F-word to every remark you can sound quite threatening.\" </p> <p>Richard Desmond was born in North London in comfortable circumstances, but they did not last. His father, the managing director of Pearl &amp; Dean Advertising, became seriously ill when Desmond was three and was rendered deaf, which put a strain on the marriage. Eight years later, Desmond moved into a tiny flat above a garage with his mother. He left Christ's College grammar school in Finchley at 14 with little ambition, and applied for a job as a cloakroom attendant at Thomson Newspapers. </p> <p>Instead, thanks to a chance encounter in the Thomson offices, he landed a job selling classified advertising space - a job to harden even the meekest of souls. Meanwhile, he continued his other career - playing drums in a rock band. He still does; the drum kit is apparently moving with him to Express Newspapers' offices at Ludgate House. </p> <p>In 1974, he started his first publishing venture, International Musician magazine, which he syndicated around the world. Buoyed by success, he launched a magazine aimed at men with a passion for gadgets. It fell flat on its face. Then he discovered the entrepreneurial drive that would propel him into the stratosphere of millionairehood. </p> <p>Desmond's first foray into soft porn was in 1982 when he struck a deal with Bob Guccione, proprietor of the US magazine Penthouse, to produce a British edition. From there he launched a raft of magazines, with adult titles jostling alongside others such as Guitar, Rock CD, Metal CD, Mountain Bike and Stamps. In 1992 he launched For Women; the first issue sold 400,000 and was the beginning of a new side of the business - selling soft porn to women. Other titles include the successful gay lifestyle magazine, Attitude. </p> <p>He made money in premium-rate telephone sex lines, but sold the business in 1988 following a run-in with British Telecom over the content of his services. He launched Television X: The Fantasy Channel, a subscription-based erotic cable channel, in 1995. It haemorrhaged money at first, but has since turned profitable as its subscriber base has grown. </p> <p>As his career as a purveyor of adult entertainment burgeoned, the rumours proliferated. But Desmond has always shrugged off the darker tales of his business life. He once told a reporter that his life was, in fact, extremely boring. \"Why won't people accept that I get up in the morning, have my breakfast, get dressed, come into the office, work, go home, eat dinner?\" he wondered aloud. \"I just run a business.\" Friends point out that less than 10% of his business revenue is derived from pornography. </p> <p>Newspapers are rarely bought and sold for economic reasons. They are acquired to win or gain influence, for reasons of ego, or as trophy assets for wealthy men to impress with at high-society dinner parties. Certainly, the Express titles were barely making any money at all, and the investment needed to turn them around will be colossal. </p> <p>Desmond had long hankered over the titles, making his first bid five years ago and saying as long ago as 1989 that \"there are a couple of national newspapers that would really give me a thrill\". He will probably be glad that he failed on the first attempt: the newspapers, which were acquired by Lord Hollick's United News &amp; Media instead, have plummeted in value since then. The luxury of Desmond's extra cash to pay for exclusives will not be lost on staff at the Daily Express, which is used to more parsimonious owners. </p> <p>From Nude Wives and Big Ones to the Daily Express: 10 years ago it would have been an unimaginably surreal journey; today, it is only slightly less so. Only in the career of Richard Desmond does it seem to make a strange kind of sense - though at Ludgate House there will surely be plenty more surrealism in the days to come. </p> <p>\u0095 Additional reporting by Maggie Brown.</p>",

      "bodyText": "MegaStar, the online offshoot of the Daily Star, has been hived off from its family of Express Digital Media websites and left behind at United News &amp; Media. As part of a \u00a3125m deal with Northern &amp; Shell, Express Newspapers has included four websites - Express.co.uk, Sportlive.co.uk, AllAboutParents.co.uk and CompanyLeader.com. However, the popular lads' website MegaStar was not included in the deal and will now sit firmly within United's new media unit, Xilerate. It is understood that United, which has just spent \u00a33m on a high-profile advertising campaign for MegaStar, had put up a strong case to keep the lads' website because of its perceived success. Since the campaign started, the number of individual users to MegaStar has grown by 40,000 to 330,000. Monthly page impressions for the site now average around 18.7m. A spokesman for United said MegaStar would be signing a content licensing agreement with the new owners of the Daily Star to keep taking 40% of its content from the paper. Xilerate's consumer websites can now be counted on one hand - LineOne, MegaStar, dotmusic and websites for Exchange &amp; Mart and Daltons Weekly. LineOne has recently been put up for sale and Xilerate's consumer travel website, uTravel, was closed down earlier this week. On the business side, Xilerate runs Farmgate, an agricultural site, and a doctors' site called Epulse. A business-to-business website for Miller Freeman's Music Week and MBI has also been mooted for some time. United plans to change its name to United Business Media before the end of the year, confirming its transformation from a multimedia giant into a business information company.",

Bin Laden, a Saudi millionaire, who is in hiding in Afghanistan, was this month named as one of the US's 10 \"most wanted\" terrorists. </p> <p>The US state department has offered a $5m (\u00a33.5m) reward for bin Laden and one of his military aides, blaming them for killing 224 people in attacks on US embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania, in August 1998.</p> <p>In 1996, bin Laden declared war on the US and issued a fatwa. A bomb was thrown at the British embassy in the Yemeni capital of San'a last month. No one was hurt in the attack, which came shortly after an apparent suicide bombing which killed 17 sailors on the USS Cole as it refuelled in the port of Aden, in southern Yemen. </p> <p>In total, 19 US Air Force personnel were killed and more than 500 Americans and Saudis injured when a truck bomb exploded outside the Khobar Towers housing complex near Dhahran in June 1996. </p> <p><b>What is being done?</b><br>The Foreign Office said it would consider stepping up security advice to Britons in the area if, as expected, the incidents are found to be car bombings. Official advice to British nationals in Saudi Arabia warns there is \"an increased threat to British interests from global terrorism\". </p> <p><b>What are the details of the earlier, fatal, attack?</b>Christopher Rodway, a hospital worker living in Riyadh, died after an explosion ripped through his car last Friday. </p> <p>His wife Jane, who was also travelling in the car, suffered minor injuries Mr Rodway, an expatriate in his 40s who worked in a Riyadh hospital, had lived in the country for eight years. </p> <p><b>Related special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/0,2759,377264,00.html\">Israel and the Middle East</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/0,2759,180403,00.html\">Iraq</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/yemen/0,2759,193338,00.html\">Yemen</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,401794,00.html\">23 November: Three Britons injured in Saudi capital blast</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4092873,00.html\">18 November: Saudi car explosion kills Briton</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4081166,00.html\">25 October: US ponders air strikes against Bin Laden</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4076833,00.html\">15 October: West's weak link is terror target</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4076525,00.html\">14 October: Yemen bombers hit UK embassy</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4076024,00.html\">13 October: Sixteen feared dead in attack on US destroyer</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4075698,00.html\">12 October: US destroyer 'rammed', at least four dead</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.al-bab.com/\" target=\"_NEW\">Al-bab.com</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.arabicnews.com/\" target=\"_new\">Arabic News</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.middleeastwire.com\" target=\"_new\">Middle East News Online</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.middleeastdaily.com\" target=\"_new\">Middle East Daily</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.secretary.state.gov/index.html\" target=\"_new\">Madeleine Albright's office</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pmo.gov.il/english\" target=\"_new\">Ehud Barak's office</a><br><a href=\"http://www.index.gov.il/eng\" target=\"_new\">Israeli government</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pna.net/\" target=\"_new\">The Palestinian National Authority</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pna.org/mininfo/\" target=\"_new\">Palestinian Ministry of Information</a><br><a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/\" target=\"_new\"> Jerusalem Post</a><br><br><a href=\"http://www.fco.gov.uk/travel/countryadvice.asp?SC\" target=\"_new\">Advice on visiting Saudi Arabia - Foreign Office</a><br><a href=\"http://www.arabia.com/saudi/article/0,5508,News|33870,00.html\" target=\"_new\">Three injured in car blast - Arabia.com</a><br><a href=\"http://www.saudinf.com/home.html\" target=\"_new\"> Saudi links - Saudi ministry of information</a></p>",

But writer and commentator on Middle East issues Hazhir Teimourian said he thought it was unlikely that the attacks were in sympathy for the Palestinians. \"These terrorists have been in place for a long time,\" he said. \"They may be happy to attribute their anger to the Palestinian cause, but I think they have their own long-term plans - which are to fight according to the wishes of their leaders such as Osama bin Laden.\" Is the US after Osma bin Laden? Yes. Bin Laden, a Saudi millionaire, who is in hiding in Afghanistan, was this month named as one of the US's 10 \"most wanted\" terrorists. The US state department has offered a $5m (\u00a33.5m) reward for bin Laden and one of his military aides, blaming them for killing 224 people in attacks on US embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania, in August 1998. In 1996, bin Laden declared war on the US and issued a fatwa. A bomb was thrown at the British embassy in the Yemeni capital of San'a last month. No one was hurt in the attack, which came shortly after an apparent suicide bombing which killed 17 sailors on the USS Cole as it refuelled in the port of Aden, in southern Yemen. In total, 19 US Air Force personnel were killed and more than 500 Americans and Saudis injured when a truck bomb exploded outside the Khobar Towers housing complex near Dhahran in June 1996. What is being done? The Foreign Office said it would consider stepping up security advice to Britons in the area if, as expected, the incidents are found to be car bombings. Official advice to British nationals in Saudi Arabia warns there is \"an increased threat to British interests from global terrorism\". What are the details of the earlier, fatal, attack?Christopher Rodway, a hospital worker living in Riyadh, died after an explosion ripped through his car last Friday. His wife Jane, who was also travelling in the car, suffered minor injuries Mr Rodway, an expatriate in his 40s who worked in a Riyadh hospital, had lived in the country for eight years.

Yes, the big picture has remained pretty stagnant in Y2K, but that's no reason not to wander into your local megastore.

      "bodyText": "If you read most music magazines you'll find their end-of-year round-ups trying oh-so-hard to convince you this has been a good year. But their hearts aren't in it. Where were the seismic cultural shifts? Where were the new Oasis/Fatboy Slim/ Spice Girls? Yes, the big picture has remained pretty stagnant in Y2K, but that's no reason not to wander into your local megastore. This year has seen the release of all manner of inspiring, exciting music, from obscure old funk tunes to jaw-breakingly hard house. If you holidayed in Ibiza or spent any Saturday (or Friday, or Thursday) night spinning around under the mirror ball, you could be forgiven for thinking this has been one of the best times dance music has had for years. So what to buy your more fashionable music-loving friends for Christmas? And what to console yourself with in the sales after receiving that novelty tie? And what about Christmas dinner? Round my mum's every Christmas is \"enlivened\" by a seasonal impulse purchase of Frank/Bing/Cliff/Kurt's favourite Christmas songs. We wouldn't suggest that mum would thank you for a DJ Hell mix tape, but perhaps it's time you sought an alternative soundtrack to the annual nut roast carve-up. Sasha/John Digweed Communicate INCredible, \u00a315.99 They do have their critics, but it remains true that Sasha and John Digweed have been probably the most talented house DJs of the year. Fitting wispy, floaty moments next to head-down club shakers, this will restart any flagging Christmas party. Various New Orleans Funk Soul Jazz, \u00a311.99 After exhaustively researching the roots of reggae with their 100% Dynamite albums, Soul Jazz dig into the vaults of Southern funk for this spectacularly entertaining mix of old-fashioned party gumbo from Aaron Neville, the Meters, Allen Toussaint et al. Ministry of Sound Annual 2000 Ministry, \u00a316.99 It wouldn't be Christmas without a Ministry of Sound Annual. Mixed by Judge Jules and Tall Paul, this has Spiller, Zombie Nation, Bob Sinclar and frankly every record you danced to in Ibiza. But probably not in Tuscany, eh Ewan? Cream Anthems 2001 Virgin, \u00a315.99 The Mizzy's perennially big Northern rival in the your-memories-are-our-demographic stakes. With Moloko/Spiller/Darude and so forth on the firm they're playing on much the same pitch as their Southern rivals. Various Disco Not Disco Strut, \u00a312.99 Yes of course you were at The Loft in New York back in 1982. We all were, in our dreams. A mix of early 1980s rock-disco crossover oddities (Ian Dury, Yoko Ono) that have lasted well, due to the influence of oddballs like London's eccentric DJ genius Harvey. Jazzanova The Remixes Compost If all that thump-thump is giving you a migraine, this Berlin-based collective have the remedy. Moulding everything to their own wonky Latin-jazz tendency, this is eminently soothing, but can cause sudden games of \"sardines\" on discerning dancefloors. Gabrielle Rise Underground Go Beat, \u00a312.99 Rather than splashing out on any one of the UK garage round-ups, go for Gab's fine batch of remixes from all the biggest names on the garridge block: Stanton Warriors, Wookie, Zed Bias and all of 2001's biggest names poke an oar in. Various Back to Love 2 Hed Kandi, \u00a315.99 If your idea of clubbing involves a purple hooded top and a lot of Soul II Soul records, relive your pre-mortgage years roaming the M25 with this bit of thirtysomething rave nostalgia.

He stripped a shirt off a mannequin to make a tourniquet, and then threw clothes over the burnt corpse.</p> <p>Such scenes, captured in gruesome detail by Israeli television, are bound to raise the pressure on Mr Barak - even while it remains uncertain which militant group is responsible for the bombing.</p> <p>Even before the blast, the tension had escalated. In the morning, Israeli troops machinegunned two Palestinian cars near the Jewish settlement of Morag in the Gaza Strip, killing four men. There was no indication the victims were armed. The Palestinians threatened retaliation.</p> <p>Within hours, Mr Arafat's Fatah militiamen were on the streets of Gaza City. \"Fatah will not let this crime pass,\" loudspeakers blared. \"We will direct our rifles against the Israeli soldiers.\"</p> <p>There was no claim of responsibility for the blast, more powerful than the car bomb at an open-air market in West Jerusalem three weeks ago. But despite the furious denials from the Palestinian Authority, Mr Barak said Yasser Arafat's administration was responsible because it had freed Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants.</p> <p>Last night, he summoned his security cabinet to discuss his next move, but previous Israeli reprisals - including the unleashing of 30 missiles on Gaza City on Monday - have only stoked the violence.</p> <p>By nightfall, reports came in of Israeli tanks in the Jewish settlement of Psagot firing on the West Bank city of Ramallah, and of roadside bombs in the Gaza Strip.</p> <p>\"Only war, that is all we can do,\" said Pnina Lev, a neighbour of a restaurant worker killed in the blast. \"We do not have to think about what America will say, or what the Arabs will say. We have the power, and we must do it.\"</p> <p>As she stood at the gates of the hospital, propping up his wailing relatives, she said: \"A man goes to work and doesn't come back home.

He stripped a shirt off a mannequin to make a tourniquet, and then threw clothes over the burnt corpse. Such scenes, captured in gruesome detail by Israeli television, are bound to raise the pressure on Mr Barak - even while it remains uncertain which militant group is responsible for the bombing. Even before the blast, the tension had escalated. In the morning, Israeli troops machinegunned two Palestinian cars near the Jewish settlement of Morag in the Gaza Strip, killing four men. There was no indication the victims were armed. The Palestinians threatened retaliation. Within hours, Mr Arafat's Fatah militiamen were on the streets of Gaza City. \"Fatah will not let this crime pass,\" loudspeakers blared. \"We will direct our rifles against the Israeli soldiers.\" There was no claim of responsibility for the blast, more powerful than the car bomb at an open-air market in West Jerusalem three weeks ago. But despite the furious denials from the Palestinian Authority, Mr Barak said Yasser Arafat's administration was responsible because it had freed Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants. Last night, he summoned his security cabinet to discuss his next move, but previous Israeli reprisals - including the unleashing of 30 missiles on Gaza City on Monday - have only stoked the violence. By nightfall, reports came in of Israeli tanks in the Jewish settlement of Psagot firing on the West Bank city of Ramallah, and of roadside bombs in the Gaza Strip. \"Only war, that is all we can do,\" said Pnina Lev, a neighbour of a restaurant worker killed in the blast. \"We do not have to think about what America will say, or what the Arabs will say. We have the power, and we must do it.\" As she stood at the gates of the hospital, propping up his wailing relatives, she said: \"A man goes to work and doesn't come back home. We can't stand it any more. In the middle of Israel, we can't stand it.\" Useful links Yasser Arafat's office Ehud Barak's office Israeli government Iris - Information Regarding Israel's Security (promoting Israeli security) Palestinian National Authority Hamas",

Because of massive demand in Japan and the US, and component droughts, Sony has rationed the number on sale.

It helps being the successor to the PlayStation 1, which has snatched 60% of the world's games console market. It also helps that its technical specification eclipses anything else on the market. Sega's Dreamcast - which has seen a rise in sales because of Sony's supply problems - runs on a chip with a speed of 200MHz. It can draw 3 million polygons per second, this being a key indicator of a console's power, and consequently the quality of its graphics. </p> <p>The PlayStation 2 has a 300Mhz chip. But the biggest difference is in the number of polygons drawn in a second: a cool 75 million. So it can display a richer variety of colours, and smoother graphics. It can also play DVDs, and is expected to lie at the centre of any Sony attempts to create home networks of electronic equipment. </p> <p>But some gamers have criticised the quality of the first selection of PS2 games. Programmers are struggling with the complexities of producing good-looking graphics for it. At the heart of the problems is its \"anti-aliasing\" capabilities which are supposed to smooth out graphics before they are displayed. On some titles, like Ridge Racer V from Namco, this feature has not worked well - particularly embarrassing for a console being sold on the power of its graphics. </p> <p>Sony is keen to play down these problems as early glitches, and promises supplies will flow more freely in the New Year.

Perhaps the Dame most closely associated with the literary establishment is Antonia Byatt, whose combination of high-minded erudition and occasional, darting forays into populism led not only to the Booker-winning, bestselling Possession but also to her attendance at the England v Germany match in Euro 96. Only Dame Antonia could describe the progress of Gascoigne, Pearce, Seaman et al with reference to Wagner, Peter Pan and Monet. Bainbridge's own passions range from Dr Johnson, the subject of her forthcoming novel, to painting, her children and grandchildren and, unrepentantly, smoking. She was apparently much impressed by the provision of ashtrays at the Palace. Quite probably, she didn't have cause to correct their accents, either.",

      "bodyText": "Voters are going to the polls in three parliamentary byelections today, in what could prove to be the last big test of the government's popularity before the next general election. Polling takes place for Commons seats at Glasgow Anniesland, Preston and West Bromwich West - all three safe Labour seats which should be held by the party despite fears of low turnouts. But any sharp slumps in Labour support or signs of a Tory revival could delay a widely expected plan for the prime minister, Tony Blair, to go to the country next May. There is also a byelection for the Scottish parliament seat at Glasgow Anniesland where Labour is expected to face a strong challenge from the Scottish Nationalists. The byelections are caused by the deaths of two MPs and the decision of Betty Boothroyd to step down from parliament when she resigned as speaker. In Glasgow Anniesland it was Donald Dewar's death from a brain haemorrhage which forced the first ever byelection for both the Westminster seat and the Scottish parliament. The so-called \"double header\" will mean voters will be faced with two ballot papers when they enter the polling booths to choose their new MP and MSP. In the traditional Labour stronghold of Preston the death of leftwing MP Audrey Wise caused the vote. There has been controversy surrounding the selection last month of 41-year-old Blairite Mark Hendrick, a former MEP and college lecturer, to fight the Lancashire seat after he defeated Wise's daughter Valerie for the nomination.

Who knows, his book might even live up to the hype. </p> <p>Not, though, his normally sensible agent Giles Gordon's hype. The book - called, significantly, At Swim, Two Boys - is, Gordon says modestly, \"a natural successor to James Joyce, Flann O'Brien and Samuel Beckett\". Simon &amp; Schuster clearly agrees and has paid \u00a3250,000-plus for the right to publish the book next September. Worldwide rights and film options are expected to boost O'Neill's earnings to the magical seven figures. </p> <p>How does he feel about being branded the new Joyce? \"Very nice, isn't it,\" he says, before giving his true opinion. \"It's very unfortunate really. It's just asking for somebody to shoot you.\" \"Giles is a good man, he'll protect you,\" I blather. \"But they won't shoot him ,\" O'Neill counters. </p> <p>O'Neill is a laconic, softly spoken 39-year-old. He lives in a rented flat near the Hogarth roundabout in west London, and for the past 10 years has earned \u00a3200 a week as a night porter at the Cassel hospital in west London, a residential hospital for mentally ill patients. </p> <p>He chose the job specifically to be able to write at night - his role was to man reception and keep an eye on the hospital - and when we met he was wondering why members of the hospital trust had been trying to call him. \"I don't think they're too pleased to know that somebody's been writing on their time,\" he says. \"It was a bit like getting a bursary from the NHS.\" </p> <p>For someone who has just hit the jackpot, he is pleasingly phlegmatic. He will be giving up his job and going back to live in his native Ireland - he was born in Dun Laoghaire, near Dublin - but had been planning to do that anyway. In any case, it isn't the usual unknown-writer-gets-fortune-for-first-book tale. </p> <p>In his late 20s he had two novels, titled Disturbance and Kilbrack, published by Weidenfeld. \"If you ask me how did they do, they didn't,\" he volunteers. \"The woman who bought the novels left, so they were orphaned.\" He more or less disowns them now, and says he can't even bear to open Kilbrack. </p> <p>However, I did open the book and was struck by the handsome, dark-haired youth on the back cover, and by the jaunty blurb describing a life spent going to festivals and eating out in restaurants. It didn't sound much like the quiet, reclusive, almost nocturnal figure in front of me. I soon discovered why. </p> <p>O'Neill, who had come across from Ireland for a fortnight in 1982 but never gone back, was chat show host Russell Harty's partner for six years before his sudden death in 1988. They lived together in Harty's cottage in Giggleswick, Yorkshire, and the shock of his death overwhelmed O'Neill. </p> <p>The experience was made worse by press intrusion - his parents back in Ireland only discovered their son was gay when they saw his photograph on the front of the Sunday Mirror - and by the determination of the Harty family to get O'Neill out of the cottage as quickly as possible. It was a disturbing experience for the 27-year-old, and one he says he is only now coming to terms with. </p> <p>\"I was in therapy for a while. I still have vivid dreams about Russell. One of the problems was that I didn't just lose a share of my heart; I lost my whole way of life.\" Harty had encouraged O'Neill's writing and read his manuscripts; by 1988 he had secured a two-book deal with Weidenfeld and the novels were published in the following two years. But then, grieving for Harty and alone in London, he found he could no longer write, parted company with both agent and publisher, and took the job at the Cassel. </p> <p>The important thing about this book, he says, is that there was no pressure to impress anyone. Clearly, living in the home of the older Harty, he had wanted to prove himself a writer: not to Harty himself, but to his friends, some of whom saw O'Neill as a hanger-on. \"I had been published and I didn't feel the push to finish this book, so I took time over it. I didn't have to prove anything.\" </p> <p>In fact, he took 10 years. The book tells of the love of two 16-year-old boys caught up in the Easter Rising in Dublin in 1916, and O'Neill makes an explicit connection between nationalism and sexual awakening. </p> <p>\"I feel that in the process of writing the book, I learned how to write and how to research. When I had finished it, I felt that I would like to start all over again and do it properly.\" Not an opinion shared by his publisher, Ian Chapman, who has pronounced it \"a painfully beautiful book\" and \"the most exciting typescript I have read in the past 10 years\". </p> <p>O'Neill's efforts to get the period detail right in the book were unstinting, and his flat is filled with books about the rebellion. \"I possibly got bogged down in the research,\" he says. \"I read a book by Arthur Koestler, and talking about writing Spartacus he said that he knew he was getting bogged down in research because he had two thick files on Roman underwear. I was getting a bit like that. But it's one of those things where you don't have to convince the reader so much as yourself. You have to know what was going on, and when you have that confidence you can leave it out.\" </p> <p>He finished the book in September and passed it to David Marcus, a literary scout in Ireland, who in turn sent it to Giles Gordon at Curtis Brown. Gordon, highly regarded and not usually given to hyperbole, called it \"the first major novel I've encountered in typescript since Vikram Seth's A Suitable Boy in 1992,\" and sold the book almost immediately to Simon &amp; Schuster. Ironically, while he was still writing it, O'Neill had pre-sold the novel to Duckworth for \u00a3400, but bought it back for the same sum when his editor left. </p> <p>O'Neill's is a remarkable story of perseverance. He gives the impression that while being published matters, writing matters more. \"I'm only really happy when I'm writing,\" he says. \"I've always been writing something.\" He was not close to his parents, nor to his siblings (none of whom knew he was gay), and perhaps needed the security of imagined worlds. Harty, in life and in death, had a profound influence on him. His death interrupted his writing, but the trauma also changed O'Neill as a person and deepened the work. He says one of the characters in the book embodies aspects of Harty. </p> <p>Referring to Flann O'Brien in the title of your book, and having a publisher determined to proclaim your literary pedigree, is courting danger, but O'Neill is alert to it. \"You don't consciously follow anyone. But it is quite difficult for an Irish writer to have Joyce standing there. He is leaning over you the whole time, and it is daunting. You get around it by being truthful to yourself.\"</p>",

And if you live outside Sunderland, burial costs are \u00a3987 for a single grave and \u00a31,282 for a double, whereas in Gateshead both cost \u00a3350. My parish is in an area of significant social deprivation and this sum is a huge burden.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Sunderland claims that its fees are lower than the national average and cites league tables compiled by the chartered institute of public finance and accountancy as proof. However, its fees have more than doubled since the institute's last report, whereas Gateshead's have remained much the same. </p> <p><strong> 'Luxury' wheelchair </strong><br> </p> <p>Most of us understand that if you fly with low-cost airlines you dispense with the \"luxuries\" of mainstream rivals. But when does a luxury become a necessity? Patience Owen of London suffers from multiple sclerosis and, although she does not use a wheelchair, she finds it difficult to walk. </p> <p>So when she flew with Ryanair she asked to be conveyed to and from the plane in an airport wheelchair. To her horror she discovered that she would be charged \u00a348 for the privilege. \"No other airline charges for this,\" she says. \"Ryanair told me it's because it's a no-frills operation.

      "bodyText": "Costly death Forget the high cost of living: Jonathan Lawson, an Anglican priest in Sunderland, is dismayed by the high cost of dying in his city. \"A single grave is \u00a3493.50; in neighbouring Gateshead it's \u00a3175,\" he says. \"A double grave is \u00a3641.20 in Sunderland; in Gateshead it's \u00a3175. And if you live outside Sunderland, burial costs are \u00a3987 for a single grave and \u00a31,282 for a double, whereas in Gateshead both cost \u00a3350. My parish is in an area of significant social deprivation and this sum is a huge burden.\" \u0095 Sunderland claims that its fees are lower than the national average and cites league tables compiled by the chartered institute of public finance and accountancy as proof. However, its fees have more than doubled since the institute's last report, whereas Gateshead's have remained much the same. 'Luxury' wheelchair Most of us understand that if you fly with low-cost airlines you dispense with the \"luxuries\" of mainstream rivals. But when does a luxury become a necessity? Patience Owen of London suffers from multiple sclerosis and, although she does not use a wheelchair, she finds it difficult to walk. So when she flew with Ryanair she asked to be conveyed to and from the plane in an airport wheelchair. To her horror she discovered that she would be charged \u00a348 for the privilege. \"No other airline charges for this,\" she says. \"Ryanair told me it's because it's a no-frills operation. Since when has a wheelchair been a frill?\" \u0095 A spokeswoman from Ryanair explained that the company wouldn't dream of charging for wheelchair users but that \"if a passenger is not a wheelchair user and is therefore capable of walking to the airplane, we would expect that passenger to walk\". Wheelchairs are hired from an airport contractor and the fee goes to them, not Ryanair.

The move dramatically reversed the chances of Al Gore gathering enough votes to defeat George W Bush. Mr Gore immediately signalled an appeal against the decision by members of the supervisory canvassing board in Miami-Dade county, where officials had recounted about a fifth of their 654,000 votes before throwing in their hand amid noisy scenes in Miami. But it was a day of unpleasant surprises for both men. Mr Bush's vice-presidential running mate, Dick Cheney, was admitted to a Washington hospital with chest pains and last night underwent a minor operation. Doctors said they had inserted a stent - tiny tube - into one of Mr Cheney's arteries to prevent it from closing. The former defence secretary, 59, has a history of heart disease and bypass surgery. Mr Gore's chances of capturing the White House were also hanging on yet another key legal ruling, this time in Palm Beach county, where a judge was to decide whether to allow \"dimpled chad\" voting papers to be included in the recount. Meanwhile, the Bush camp was weighing the chances of taking the Florida supreme court ruling to the US supreme court in Washington, confirming how much was at stake. But the chances of success were viewed sceptically by independent legal experts. The federal supreme court was thought unlikely to want to intervene in a matter of state law. The new mood of litigiousness on the Bush side was underscored by fresh court filings on the Texas governor's behalf in Tallahassee, where a court was asked to order all postal votes cast before November 7 by members of the armed services to be included in the count. Meanwhile, Mr Gore's lieutenant William Daley tried to steady his side's nerves by stressing that the recounts were \"mandatory\" and called for \"the rule of law\" to be upheld. But yesterday was not a day for the Queensberry rules, as the gloves came off in the fist fight for the presidency and Mr Bush led an angry Republican reaction to the possibility that Tuesday night's supreme court ruling might hand the White House to Al Gore. In their judgment, the seven judges voted unanimously to instruct Florida's secretary of state, Katherine Harris, to accept the results of manual recounts in Broward, Palm Beach and Miami-Dade counties before a 5pm Sunday deadline. The ruling kept the doors open for Mr Gore to claw back Mr Bush's existing 930-vote lead in Florida, but the decision in Miami-Dade threw all calculations up in the air once again. Mr Bush accused the Florida court of \"usurping\" the authority of election officials and of \"overreaching\" its powers in keeping the recount process open until Sunday night's deadline. \"No fair or accurate result\" was now possible in Florida, he warned in a statement delivered in Austin. \"I believe secretary Cheney and I won the vote in Florida. And I believe some are determined to keep counting in an effort to change the legitimate result,\" Mr Bush said. The man who campaigned before November 7 as a candidate who would \"change the tone in Washington DC\" signalled a sharply partisan turn which was taken up throughout the party. In Tallahassee, Mr Bush's lieutenant James Baker invited the Republican-controlled Florida legislature to step in and declare Mr Bush the winner. \"One should not now be surprised if the Florida legislature seeks to affirm the original rules,\" Mr Baker said in a statement condemning the court's \"unjust result\". Other top Republicans echoed the defiant mood. Governor Mark Racicot of Montana, who has emerged as an important mouthpiece for Mr Bush in the past week, threatened \"some extraordinary\" measures to overcome the effects of the court's ruling. As the political temperature rose in Washington, so did tempers in Florida, where there were angry scenes in Miami as Republicans accused a Democratic lawyer of stealing a ballot paper and as Republican observers shouted and demonstrated outside the meeting of the county election canvassing board. After Tuesday's ruling, Mr Gore announced \"democracy is the winner\" and welcomed the court's reassertion of the principle that \"the will of the people should prevail\".

      "bodyText": "Florida's supreme court appeared to give Al Gore a lifeline when it ruled that the local secretary of state, Katherine Harris, must accept the results of all county recounts submitted before a 5pm Sunday deadline. The ruling late on Tuesday night upheld almost everything Mr Gore's lawyers wanted, and meant that the doors were left open to allow the continuation of recounts that could take Mr Gore's total past Mr Bush's. Stating that \"an accurate vote count is one of the essential foundations of our democracy\", the court said the rights of the voters took precedence. \"We consistently have adhered to the principle that the will of the people is the paramount consideration,\" the court ruled in its unanimous 42-page decision. \"Our goal remains ... to reach the result that reflects the will of the voters, whatever that may be,\" the ruling added. The judges, largely Democrat-appointed, placed themselves in the political crossfire with their ruling, which angered Republicans. The court swept away Ms Harris's imposition of a November 14 deadline for the receipt of county returns, replacing it with November 26. The court tried to strike a balance between those who argued that the state should do everything permissible to ensure that as many votes as possible were recounted in a lawful way, and those who argued that Florida could not run the risk of its electoral college votes being excluded. The judgment means that lawyers for both sides will have time after the deadline to challenge the results which Ms Harris will certify and still meet the crucial December 12 deadline by which the membership of Florida's electoral college must be appointed. The court's ruling gave support to the principle that ballots initially counted by machine can properly be checked by human hand, as the Gore campaign wants. \"Although error cannot be completely eliminated in any tabulation of the ballots, our society has not yet gone so far as to place blind faith in machines.\" And there were strong words for Ms Harris, who has been thrust into the international spotlight. \"To allow the secretary to summarily disenfranchise innocent electors in an effort to punish dilatory [canvassing] board members, as she proposes in the present case, misses the constitutional mark,\" the court said.

      "body": "<p>The race for the presidency yesterday boiled down to a scramble in three Democratic counties to sort through about 28,000 disputed ballots in the teeth of determined Republican opposition before a Sunday evening deadline laid down by the Florida supreme court.</p> <p>As tempers frayed in Miami-Dade, Palm Beach and Broward counties - a strip of south Florida coastline which has become ground zero in a bizarre electoral endgame - Republican and Democratic representatives engaged in ballot-by-ballot combat as the counting accelerated.</p> <p>In Miami-Dade county, scuffles broke out between Republican count observers and police after election officials took the controversial decision to scrap a general recount of its 588,000 votes, in order to concentrate on 10,750 contested ballots which are thought most likely to yield extra votes for Al Gore.</p> <p>Two hours later, the county canvassing board took an even more explosive decision when it bowed to a combination of Republican anger, tight timetables and sheer exhaustion, and called off even that count. If the board's decision stood, it would be a potentially disabling blow to Al Gore's hopes that the recounts would give him the votes he needs to capture Florida and the White House.</p> <p>In their earlier meeting, the three members of the board argued that it would not be able to perform a complete recount by 5pm on Sunday, the deadline set by the state's supreme court.</p> <p>The Republican observers chanted \"cheats\" and \"the world is watching\" and accused a Democratic official of stealing a ballot from the Miami-Dade counting room. Kendall Coffey, a Democratic lawyer, said the official had only taken a sample ballot for use in court, but the incident reflected an increasingly volatile mood surrounding the recount.</p> <p>In Palm Beach county, Democratic lawyers took election officials to court in an attempt to force them to count all \"dimpled\" or \"pregnant\" ballots, on which the voter had dented the punchcard ballot but had failed to punch a complete hole alongside the name of a presidential candidate. Such ballots would not be registered as votes by vote-counting machines, but could conceivably be interpreted as votes by the human eye.</p> <p>Dimpled ballots are at the centre of the rancorous post-election struggle. In the counties where the Democrats had demanded a hand recount, the new tallies did not appear to be producing enough extra votes for Mr Gore to overturn George W Bush's 930-vote lead in Florida.</p> <p>By yesterday, the recounts had boosted Mr Gore's total by 106 in Broward (with all precincts counted), 157 in Miami-Dade (with about a fifth of its precincts counted), and three in Palm Beach (with a fifth of the precincts counted). Analysts said that many of the precincts yet to be counted were mostly Republican.</p> <p>However, a total of 27,761 ballots were rejected as \"undervotes\" by counting machines in the three counties, and have to be reviewed by three-member canvassing boards in each county.</p> <p>Undervotes are ballots which register no presidential vote on the machines, but the Democrats argue that many of them are \"dimpled\" ballots which ought to be counted.

      "bodyText": "The race for the presidency yesterday boiled down to a scramble in three Democratic counties to sort through about 28,000 disputed ballots in the teeth of determined Republican opposition before a Sunday evening deadline laid down by the Florida supreme court. As tempers frayed in Miami-Dade, Palm Beach and Broward counties - a strip of south Florida coastline which has become ground zero in a bizarre electoral endgame - Republican and Democratic representatives engaged in ballot-by-ballot combat as the counting accelerated. In Miami-Dade county, scuffles broke out between Republican count observers and police after election officials took the controversial decision to scrap a general recount of its 588,000 votes, in order to concentrate on 10,750 contested ballots which are thought most likely to yield extra votes for Al Gore. Two hours later, the county canvassing board took an even more explosive decision when it bowed to a combination of Republican anger, tight timetables and sheer exhaustion, and called off even that count. If the board's decision stood, it would be a potentially disabling blow to Al Gore's hopes that the recounts would give him the votes he needs to capture Florida and the White House. In their earlier meeting, the three members of the board argued that it would not be able to perform a complete recount by 5pm on Sunday, the deadline set by the state's supreme court. The Republican observers chanted \"cheats\" and \"the world is watching\" and accused a Democratic official of stealing a ballot from the Miami-Dade counting room. Kendall Coffey, a Democratic lawyer, said the official had only taken a sample ballot for use in court, but the incident reflected an increasingly volatile mood surrounding the recount. In Palm Beach county, Democratic lawyers took election officials to court in an attempt to force them to count all \"dimpled\" or \"pregnant\" ballots, on which the voter had dented the punchcard ballot but had failed to punch a complete hole alongside the name of a presidential candidate. Such ballots would not be registered as votes by vote-counting machines, but could conceivably be interpreted as votes by the human eye. Dimpled ballots are at the centre of the rancorous post-election struggle. In the counties where the Democrats had demanded a hand recount, the new tallies did not appear to be producing enough extra votes for Mr Gore to overturn George W Bush's 930-vote lead in Florida. By yesterday, the recounts had boosted Mr Gore's total by 106 in Broward (with all precincts counted), 157 in Miami-Dade (with about a fifth of its precincts counted), and three in Palm Beach (with a fifth of the precincts counted). Analysts said that many of the precincts yet to be counted were mostly Republican. However, a total of 27,761 ballots were rejected as \"undervotes\" by counting machines in the three counties, and have to be reviewed by three-member canvassing boards in each county. Undervotes are ballots which register no presidential vote on the machines, but the Democrats argue that many of them are \"dimpled\" ballots which ought to be counted. They believe that an analysis of these \"dimples\" would swing the Florida result to Mr Gore. Republicans have been outraged by the attempts to include \"dimpled\" ballots as votes and point to the changing criteria used by the three canvassing boards to interpret them as proof that the process is subjective and haphazard. The Florida supreme court ruling delivered on Tuesday night gave no firm guidelines. The Miami-Dade board has used a liberal interpretation of the dimpled ballot, counting as votes any ballot where the chad (the small perforated cardboard rectangle the voter is supposed to punch out to indicate his or her preference) had been pushed in enough to allow a chink of light through the punchcard. Broward county has yet to make up its mind over \"dimpled\" ballots. Palm Beach initially used this \"sunshine rule\" but switched after a few thousand votes had been counted, to accept only \"dimpled\" chads as votes for the presidency if the voter had consistently marked other parts of the ballot (for congressional and local positions) with the same sort of marks. \"We are trying to find out why the voter had a problem,\" Charles Burton, the head of the Palm Beach canvassing board said yesterday. \"If they consistenly had the problem, we are determining that shows intent [to vote].\" Mr Burton was speaking in a Palm Beach courtroom, where Democratic lawyers were attempting to force the canvassing board to accept all \"dimpled\" ballots.

      "bodyText": "The chances of Al Gore gathering enough votes to defeat George W Bush in the US presidential election suffered a blow yesterday when Florida's largest county abandoned its recount. And in a separate move, Mr Bush asked the US supreme court to bar the use of recounted ballots in the state. Mr Gore immediately moved to appeal against the decision by members of the supervisory canvassing board in Miami-Dade county, where officials had recounted about a fifth of their 654,000 votes before throwing in their hand amid noisy scenes in Miami. The board claimed it could not meet a new timetable set by the state supreme court in a ruling late on Tuesday night that said the counting in three Florida counties should continue. Meanwhile, Mr Bush's lawyers filed two appeals with the highest US court. \"This is a case of the utmost national importance, involving the constitution's most fundamental rights as exercised in the nation's most important election,\" the lawyers said in court papers. The chances of success were viewed sceptically by independent legal experts. The federal supreme court was thought unlikely to want to intervene in a matter of state law. In a day of unpleasant surprises for both men, Mr Bush's vice-presidential running mate, Dick Cheney, was admitted to a Washington hospital where doctors last night said he had suffered a \"very slight heart attack\". Mr Bush had earlier insisted: \"Dick Cheney is healthy. He did not have a heart attack.\" A stent - tiny tube - was inserted into one of Mr Cheney's arteries to stop it closing. The former defence secretary, 59, has a history of heart disease and bypass surgery. Mr Gore's one boost last night was when a Florida judge ruled that \"dimpled chad\" voting papers could be accepted in the Palm Beach recount as long as the intention of the voter was clearly discernible. The new mood of litigiousness on the Bush side was underscored in Tallahassee, where a court was asked to order all postal votes cast before November 7 by members of the armed services to be included in the count. Mr Gore's lieutenant, William Daley, tried to steady his side's nerves by stressing the recounts were \"mandatory\" and calling for \"the rule of law\" to be upheld. Yesterday was not a day for the Queensberry rules, as the gloves came off in the fist fight for the presidency and Mr Bush led an angry Republican reaction to the possibility that Tuesday night's state supreme court ruling might hand the White House to Al Gore. In their judgment, the seven judges voted unanimously to instruct Florida's secretary of state, Katherine Harris, to accept the results of manual recounts in Broward, Palm Beach and Miami-Dade counties before a 5pm Sunday deadline. The ruling kept the doors open for Mr Gore to claw back Mr Bush's existing 930-vote lead in Florida, but the decision in Miami-Dade threw all calculations up in the air again. Mr Bush accused the Florida court of \"usurping\" the authority of election officials and of \"overreaching\" its powers in keeping the recount process open until Sunday night's deadline. \"No fair or accurate result\" was now possible in Florida, he warned in a statement delivered in Austin. \"I believe secretary Cheney and I won the vote in Florida.

      "bodyText": "A small explosion in the Saudi capital has injured three British citizens, the second such explosion in a week. The explosion late last night hit a car carrying two men and a woman - all British workers at an unidentified company in Riyadh - the director of Riyadh police department told the Saudi Riyadh Daily. The three were taken to a hospital, where one was in stable condition with an injured right leg. The other two were slightly injured, the newspaper reported. The Foreign Office confirmed Wednesday's explosion. A spokesman said it was too early to speculate on the cause. By this morning, the start of the weekend in Saudi Arabia, the street and surrounding mixed residential and business neighbourhood were quiet. Workers in the area said they had heard the explosion and seen police arrive to briefly cordon off the area last night. Last Friday, Christopher Rodway, 48, a British citizen working in a Saudi hospital, died after a small explosion tore through his car, which was believed to have been booby-trapped. Rodway's wife, Jane, 50, was slightly injured. Another Saudi paper, Okaz, quoted Deputy Interior Minister Prince Ahmed as saying the two explosions could be related, but that the three injured last night did not work with the Rodways. \"What happened... has no political undertones, it is a personal matter,\" Ahmed was quoted as saying. US forces in Saudi Arabia and other parts of the Gulf have been on highest alert since an October 12 attack on the USS Cole killed 17 American sailors in the port of Aden, Yemen. Such an alert level is only issued when an attack occurs in the region or when there is specific information indicating that one may occur. American residents in Saudi Arabia had been reminded of the alert, with the US Embassy describing it as a \"precautionary measure.\" Related special reports Israel &amp; the Middle East Iraq Yemen Related articles November 18: Saudi car explosion kills Briton October 25: US ponders air strikes against Bin Laden October 15: West's weak link is terror target October 14: Yemen bombers hit UK embassy October 13: Sixteen feared dead in attack on US destroyer October 12: US destroyer 'rammed', at least four dead Useful links Al-bab.com Arabic News Middle East News Online Middle East Daily Madeleine Albright's office Ehud Barak's office Israeli government The Palestinian National Authority Palestinian Ministry of Information Jerusalem Post",

      "bodyText": "One of the great medieval mysteries - the origin and purpose of what is commonly referred to as King Arthur's Round Table - could have been solved. Historians over the centuries have tried to discover when the table, at the Great Hall in Winchester, was built and why. Now a 20-year investigation by historians has found it could have been the central part of an elaborate medieval Arthurian fancy dress ball in the reign of Edward I, the notorious Hammer of the Scots. Martin Biddle believes timber dating of the 51 superb oak planks, completed in the last few months, proves it was made for the event in 1290 to celebrate the betrothal of two children - Edward, the son of Edward I, and Margaret, the child Queen of Scotland. \"This table is a hugely important object, the greatest piece of English medieval furniture to survive, and perhaps the greatest monument to the tradition of English chivalry,\" said Professor Biddle, head of medieval archaeology at Oxford University. The table is world famous - tiny images of it are worn as the symbol of the international Round Table organisation - but has often been dismissed as a Tudor fake. In fact when it was restored in the 18th century, and when Henry VIII first ordered it to be painted in 1519, it was already ancient, the oldest surviving round table in Europe. If Arthur ever existed, archaeologists believe he was probably a dark ages Romano-British warlord. However, the romance of Arthur, and his fellowship of knights seated at a round table, had a powerful grip on the medieval imagina tion, and on no one more strongly than the king, Edward I. In household accounts and contemporary records, previously missed by historians, Prof Biddle pieced together the tournament and feast the king organised at Winchester. His best knights fought in Arthurian costume, as the legendary heroes Lancelot, Galahad and companions, and feasted afterwards at the round table.",

Mr Cheney was admitted to Washington University hospital before dawn with chest and shoulder pains. Doctors inserted a stent, a small mesh tube, into a narrowed artery to restore blood flow but it was only at the second of two press conferences that they disclosed Mr Cheney's real condition. George W Bush had initially insisted that his 59-year-old running mate had not had a heart attack. \"Dick Cheney is healthy. He did not have a heart attack.\" But later Dr Alan Wasserman, a professor of medicine and cardiology, said: \"There was a very slight heart attack.\" An initial blood test and electrocardiogram did not show signs of an attack, but a second blood test showed elevated cardiac enzymes that indicated a small heart attack had occurred, Dr Wasserman confirmed. Mr Cheney, the former defence secretary to George Bush Sr, has a history of heart trouble but had been given a clean bill of health by doctors when George W Bush picked him as running mate. Mr Cheney had his first heart attack in 1978 when he was 37. A second followed in 1984 and a third four years later. All were described as mild. Following the third attack he underwent quadruple heart bypass surgery. Doctors said that Mr Cheney would remain in hospital for up to three days and played down the possibility that he would need more extensive treatment. \"It would be exceedingly unlikely for him to undergo a repeat bypass operation,\" Dr Jonathan Reiner, Mr Cheney's personal doctor, said. Stents work well for many patients but in between 20% and 30% of cases the artery can become clogged again, particularly in patients such as Mr Cheney with a long history of heart disease.

The shadow chancellor, Michael Portillo, said:\"Labour have been promising to improve public services from day one. \"But three and a half years later, taxes are up and Labour's spending is failing to deliver.\" Priority areas \u0095 Health \u00a31.4bn extra spending in NHS capital spending over three years. This will lead to 100 major new hospital projects by 2010, 250 new scanners, modernisation of over 3,000 GP premises and 500 one stop primary care centres. \u0095 Education Extra \u00a31.6bn in capital spending for most urgent repairs in 7,000 schools and complete refurbishment in 650 schools. \u0095 Transport 150% increase in transport public investment designed to produce 50% rise in rail passenger use, and 10% rise in bus use. \u0095 Home Office Extra 20% for police capital spending, mainly on CCTV and information technology. \u0095 Environment An extra \u00a31.6bn a year by 2003-4 compared with 2000-1 to cut by a third the number of houses not of a decent standard.",

Experts believe Barclays may have got up to \u00a3400,000-worth of free publicity during Monday night's show because the bank has its name emblazoned on the cheques handed over by presenter Chris Tarrant.

      "bodyText": "A forthcoming online trading service for TV programme ideas has just picked up \u00a3250,000 pounds in start-up funding. Kiaron Finnegan, a TV producer and former editor of Kilroy, has sold a 45% stake in his soon-to-launch business, TVToBe.com, to StartIT, a seed venture capital firm. Mr Finnegan set up the business after he saw a gap in the market for sifting through ideas for new TV programmes. Mr Finnegan, CEO of TVToBe.com, said: \"Broadcasters are always looking for fresh new ideas but have only limited time to search. The traditional method is a very inefficient use of their time. \"Producers are very keen to get their proposals in front of the right people but some, especially the smaller independents, often struggle to do this. TVToBe.com provides the right channel for both parties.\" Proposal summaries will appear anonymously on the site's database for broadcasters to search or choose to browse at random. If they like the synopsis, TVToBe.com arranges a meeting between the two parties. If the programme gets commissioned, TVToBe.com will take a 2%-3% commission. In the UK it is estimated that there are around 450 commissioning editors and 2,500 independent producers. The \u00a3250,000 investment is StartIT's eight investment to date.",

My problem is that it does not provide a newsnet server for Usenet newsgroups. Can I set up a secondary ISP just for newsgroups? If so, how easy is it and can you recommend any particular ISPs, preferably also free, for this? <strong>Lindsay Jackson</strong> <br> <a href=\"mailto:l_c_jackson@yahoo.co.uk\">l_c_jackson@yahoo.co.uk</a> </p> <p>It is a good idea to have at least two ISPs as the quality of service can vary. Details of how to set up extra ISPs were given in the previous <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4088176,00.html\">Start Here</a>. I don't know which free ISP offers the best Usenet service but Freeserve would be one place to start. </p> <p>You could also look at some of the public news servers to see if they offer the groups you want. Try <a href=\"http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Usenet/Public_News_Servers\">www.dmoz.org/Computers/Usenet/Public_News_Servers</a> and on the Public News Server Web Ring (see <a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Studios/9594/public.htm\">www.geocities.com/SoHo/Studios/9594/public.htm</a>). </p> <p>At least one public server works in the UK: Taliesin. To set it up with Yahoo, run Internet Explorer, go to Tools|Accounts and select the News tab. Click the Add button, select News, then follow the wizard's prompts, entering taliesin.netcom.net.uk as the address. </p> <p>There are also numerous paid-for Usenet services (eg <a href=\"http://www.usenet-access.com\">www.usenet-access.com</a> ) which are marketed on the huge number of newsgroups they carry, and the fact that they are not censored. </p> <p><strong> Downloads</strong><br> When I try to download media files, I sometimes get the option to save in a folder, which is what I want, but at other times it is decided by the site I am downloading from. This means that I cannot find the file, or have to access the internet if I do click on it. How can I save files where I want? <strong>Colin Pierce</strong> <br> <a href=\"mailto:colin@zwemmer.com\">colin@zwemmer.com</a> </p> <p>You can usually save a file where you want by right-clicking on the link to the file and choosing Save Target As. This will let you decide what to call the file, and where to save it. </p> <p>If you think a file has downloaded but you are not sure where, you can try to find it using the Find Files dialogue ( Start | Find | Files or Folders ). Type in *.mpg (or whatever the extension is) and set the date to find only things downloaded that day. (If you know the filename, of course, you can search for that.) </p> <p>You may find the file in the Temporary Internet Files directory in Windows. Sort the directory by Size (by clicking the Size column label twice) and the biggest files will appear at the top. Then right-click on the file you want, hold down the mouse button, move it to your chosen directory, let go, and use the drop-down menu to copy it there. </p> <p>There are several good reasons for downloading files with a download manager instead. A program such as <a href=\"http://www.getright.com\">GetRight</a>will resume a download if you lose the connection (assuming the server supports resuming), download several files at the same time, and even download different sections of the same file at the same. Since GetRight is doing the downloading, you can always save files where you want. </p> <p>Other Windows managers include A HREF=\"http://www.reget.com\" TARGET=\"_NEW\"&gt;Reget, <a href=\"http://www.gozilla.com\">Go!Zilla</a> and <a href=\"http://www.metaproducts.com/MD.html\">Mass Downloader</a>. </p> <p><strong> Change menu</strong><br> How can I edit the New menu presented by Explorer when I right-click either on the desktop or in an Explorer window? I have 28 options and I want to reduce these to about six. <strong>Grahame Stevens</strong> <br> <a href=\"mailto:geestevens@yahoo.co.uk\">geestevens@yahoo.co.uk</a> </p> <p>The New menu is very useful because it provides an easy way to create a new folder, a text file, or a file suitable for another registered program. However, if a lot of programs take advantage of this feature, the menu can become overlong. </p> <p>The obvious way to shorten it is to use the RegEdit program to edit the system's Registry, which holds the instructions telling Windows how to behave. It involves finding the ShellNew key for each program you want to remove and changing it. But, editing the Registry is hazardous and nobody will do it if there is an easy alternative. </p> <p>Fortunately there is. Microsoft offers a program called TweakUI for tweaking the user interface - it's one of the \"power toys\" - and I am reliably informed it will let you delete entries from the New menu. If you have Windows 95, you should be able to download a suitable version from Microsoft's web site (see <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/windows95/downloads/contents/wutoys/w95pwrtoysset/default.asp\">www.microsoft.com/windows95/downloads/contents/wutoys/w95pwrtoysset/default.asp</a>). If you have Win dows 98, it should be hidden on the CD-rom in the \\tools\\reskit\\powertoy\\folder. Just right-click on tweakui.inf and select Install to add it to your system. </p> <p>If you change your mind, TweakUI also lets you put entries back. It's just a matter of ticking the boxes you want. </p> <p>If you like tweaking Windows, there is also a much more powerful program called X-Setup, available free from Xteq at <a href=\"http://www.xteq.com/main.html\">www.xteq.com/main.html</a>. </p> <p><strong> Missing file</strong><br> When I switch on my computer I get a message saying the system.ini file refers to a device file that no longer exists. I suspect this is a file from a game demo that may have been deleted rather than uninstalled. The instruction that comes up says the missing file is C:\\KADEMO\\VRSD.386 Is there any way I can cure this problem? <strong>Charles Lauder</strong> <br> <a href=\"mailto:c.w.lauder@talk21.com\">c.w.lauder@talk21.com</a> </p> <p>Windows tries to load files it is told to load by the system.ini file and naturally complains if it can't find them. If you are sure you don't need the file - as with this leftover apparently from Star Trek: Klingon Academy Demo 1.0 - you can stop Windows from trying to load it by putting a semi-colon and a space (; ) at the start of the line that refers to the file. The simplest way to do this is to go to Start | Run and type sysedit to load the program that edits system files. </p> <p>Click on the pane labelled C:\\WINDOWS\\SYSTEM.INI to bring it to the top, and insert ; before C:\\KADEMO\\VRSD.386 </p> <p> Finally, select File | Save to save the amended file, quit SysEdit, and restart your PC. </p> <p>The reason for \"commenting out\" lines in system.ini rather than simply deleting them is to make it easier to restore lines if necessary. </p> <p><strong> OE problems</strong><br> (1) When I open my Inbox in Outlook Express, how do I get it to go straight to the new messages, rather than the top (and oldest) one on the list? </p> <p>(2) The address book used to appear on the left hand side when I opened Outlook Express under the folders options.

At least one public server works in the UK: Taliesin. To set it up with Yahoo, run Internet Explorer, go to Tools|Accounts and select the News tab. Click the Add button, select News, then follow the wizard's prompts, entering taliesin.netcom.net.uk as the address. There are also numerous paid-for Usenet services (eg www.usenet-access.com ) which are marketed on the huge number of newsgroups they carry, and the fact that they are not censored. Downloads When I try to download media files, I sometimes get the option to save in a folder, which is what I want, but at other times it is decided by the site I am downloading from. This means that I cannot find the file, or have to access the internet if I do click on it. How can I save files where I want? Colin Pierce colin@zwemmer.com You can usually save a file where you want by right-clicking on the link to the file and choosing Save Target As. This will let you decide what to call the file, and where to save it. If you think a file has downloaded but you are not sure where, you can try to find it using the Find Files dialogue ( Start | Find | Files or Folders ). Type in *.mpg (or whatever the extension is) and set the date to find only things downloaded that day. (If you know the filename, of course, you can search for that.) You may find the file in the Temporary Internet Files directory in Windows. Sort the directory by Size (by clicking the Size column label twice) and the biggest files will appear at the top. Then right-click on the file you want, hold down the mouse button, move it to your chosen directory, let go, and use the drop-down menu to copy it there. There are several good reasons for downloading files with a download manager instead. A program such as GetRightwill resume a download if you lose the connection (assuming the server supports resuming), download several files at the same time, and even download different sections of the same file at the same. Since GetRight is doing the downloading, you can always save files where you want. Other Windows managers include A HREF=\"http://www.reget.com\" TARGET=\"_NEW\"&gt;Reget, Go!Zilla and Mass Downloader. Change menu How can I edit the New menu presented by Explorer when I right-click either on the desktop or in an Explorer window? I have 28 options and I want to reduce these to about six. Grahame Stevens geestevens@yahoo.co.uk The New menu is very useful because it provides an easy way to create a new folder, a text file, or a file suitable for another registered program. However, if a lot of programs take advantage of this feature, the menu can become overlong. The obvious way to shorten it is to use the RegEdit program to edit the system's Registry, which holds the instructions telling Windows how to behave. It involves finding the ShellNew key for each program you want to remove and changing it. But, editing the Registry is hazardous and nobody will do it if there is an easy alternative. Fortunately there is. Microsoft offers a program called TweakUI for tweaking the user interface - it's one of the \"power toys\" - and I am reliably informed it will let you delete entries from the New menu. If you have Windows 95, you should be able to download a suitable version from Microsoft's web site (see www.microsoft.com/windows95/downloads/contents/wutoys/w95pwrtoysset/default.asp). If you have Win dows 98, it should be hidden on the CD-rom in the \\tools\\reskit\\powertoy\\folder. Just right-click on tweakui.inf and select Install to add it to your system. If you change your mind, TweakUI also lets you put entries back. It's just a matter of ticking the boxes you want. If you like tweaking Windows, there is also a much more powerful program called X-Setup, available free from Xteq at www.xteq.com/main.html. Missing file When I switch on my computer I get a message saying the system.ini file refers to a device file that no longer exists. I suspect this is a file from a game demo that may have been deleted rather than uninstalled. The instruction that comes up says the missing file is C:\\KADEMO\\VRSD.386 Is there any way I can cure this problem? Charles Lauder c.w.lauder@talk21.com Windows tries to load files it is told to load by the system.ini file and naturally complains if it can't find them. If you are sure you don't need the file - as with this leftover apparently from Star Trek: Klingon Academy Demo 1.0 - you can stop Windows from trying to load it by putting a semi-colon and a space (; ) at the start of the line that refers to the file. The simplest way to do this is to go to Start | Run and type sysedit to load the program that edits system files. Click on the pane labelled C:\\WINDOWS\\SYSTEM.INI to bring it to the top, and insert ; before C:\\KADEMO\\VRSD.386 Finally, select File | Save to save the amended file, quit SysEdit, and restart your PC. The reason for \"commenting out\" lines in system.ini rather than simply deleting them is to make it easier to restore lines if necessary. OE problems (1) When I open my Inbox in Outlook Express, how do I get it to go straight to the new messages, rather than the top (and oldest) one on the list? (2) The address book used to appear on the left hand side when I opened Outlook Express under the folders options. I once closed it and it now no longer appears. How do I get it back?

      "body": "<p>On the wall of the governor's office at Feltham young offenders' institution there are three picture hooks. Normally the governors' roll hangs here - an oak board bearing the names of those who have occupied perhaps the hottest seat in the prison service. On a chill morning earlier this week the hooks were vacant. \"It's down in the workshop having my name added. The paint's not dry yet,\" says Nick Pascoe, the new boss of Britain's most notorious youth prison. From the window, through a thick mist, we can make out the top of the steel-mesh fence crowned with rolled razor wire that marks the boundaries of his estate; 96 acres housing up to 700 of the most disturbed, deprived and dangerous young men in the country. </p> <p>The office may as well have a revolving door. Pascoe, who started three weeks ago, is the fifth man to take the job in the past 18 months. He was tempted back from his job at a private jail by Martin Narey, the director general of the prison service, whose arrival we await. \"I shall tell him I returned the company car this morning,\" Pascoe says with a wry grin. \"That's the ultimate sacrifice, isn't it?\" </p> <p>Having to run his own car will be the least of Pascoe's worries. Within days of the new governor taking up his post a former Feltham prisoner, Robert Stewart, was convicted of murdering his 19-year-old Asian cellmate, Zahid Mubarek. Stewart, a 20-year-old racist psychopath with a cross and the letters RIP tattooed on his forehead, beat Zahid to death with a table leg in their 7ft by 10ft cell in the middle of the night in March. An internal inquiry found that ample evidence of Stewart's racist, violent tendencies and declining mental health had been missed or ignored by prison staff. </p> <p>Stewart's conviction was the latest event in a miserable year for the jail. On a Saturday morning at the end of October, tensions spilled over and officers lost control of a unit housing 60 prisoners. In the four hours it took to regain control, the wing was trashed. In September, Kevin Henson, 16, ended his short, tragic life with a noose hung from an exposed pipe in his cell. Pascoe's task is to turn Feltham around. It will not be easy. </p> <p>Serving every court in London and most of those in the south-east, Feltham is the largest young offenders' institution in the country; it sees 30,000 boys and young men between the age of 15 and 21 pass through its gates every year. Some stay briefly on remand; others are at the start of a long prison career. Feltham is short-staffed, 23-hour-a-day bang-ups are common, morale is low and the institution's reputation stinks. One experienced youth worker dismisses it as \"a finishing school for career criminals\". </p> <p>Pascoe thinks of the place in less absolute terms. \"Some of these men are dangerous and sophisticated criminals; others are totally unsophisticated and very damaged. The public expectation is that if you put them in a prison they will never reoffend. That's unrealistic. As a society have to decide what the purpose of imprisonment is - what do we want it to do?\" </p> <p>What Narey wants it to do is educate. \"Of a total prison population of 60,000, around 40,000 are unemployable. What I want to do is give them basic education and constructive employment,\" he says in soft Teesside tones. \"If they haven't got a job, of course they'll reoffend. They have no choice.\" </p> <p>We are here to look at Feltham's new \u00a36m education and reception unit for juvenile offenders, the 15- to 18-year-olds who are Narey's priority. Opened in August, it is a pristine pale-blue building with classrooms that any inner-city headmaster would give his chalk and board for. The smell of paint still lingers, not yet chased away by the ubiquitous prison odour of chips, rolling tobacco and sweat. The backing track of prison life - shouts and footfalls, jangling keys and slamming steel doors - is left outside. Narey grasps the hand of every officer and volunteer we pass and gives them the opportunity to bend his ear. </p> <p>Inside the classrooms, groups of a dozen are studying information technology and basic literacy and numeracy. Most of the kids here got nothing out of school except bitter experience. Now the teachers at Feltham are trying to capitalise on the one advantage they have: a captive audience. The work is a grind and the potential for disruption massive, yet by tiny degrees the teacher maintains order and attention. One lad with a reputation for trouble is multiplying at the blackboard. He takes the arrival of the director general and friends as an opportunity to switch off. He tries to grab a handful of forms, then tries to sit when the teacher wants him to stand. She is having none of it and eventually he finishes his sums. </p> <p>\"What you just saw there was a little triumph,\" says Narey when we leave. \"That lady got the lad to pay attention using nothing more than communication skills. Hundreds of potential incidents every day can be defused like that.\" </p> <p>But this new education unit is far from the whole story at Feltham. On the other side of the fence that separates the juveniles from the 18- to 21-year-olds, the huge demands placed on Feltham are clear. In units housing up to 60 lads, half can be banged up all day, unlocked only to collect their meals. </p> <p>Swallow unit is where Mubarek was killed. The cells run on two decks along two walls, and facing them are the servery and the officers' control room. In between is the association area, with a pool table, its baize almost worn through. The lads emerge for lunch. \"We have to unlock slow because we've some characters in at the moment,\" says an officer. \"They don't all get on as we might like.\" Those who are first in the queue collect a plate of thin chips; pale peas; a choice of pie, fish or corned beef; a bread roll and an apple. How's the food? \"Shit,\" an inmate replies. </p> <p>The cells have brightly painted red, blue and yellow doors. Inside they are a dreary cream, although an inmate painting team is busy brightening them up. The sheets are brown. One lad says his window leaks and points to some brown stains. \"That's spit - people used it to stick posters to the walls. I can't get it off.\" Prisoners have to be inventive to stick up their lad-mag pin-ups. Toothpaste is a current favourite, although Narey encountered a man at Parkhurst who used semen. \"Very effective,\" he says, with a grimace. </p> <p>In cell 38, where Mubarek was killed, the two beds are 3ft apart. The toilet is in a doorless alcove. The only ventilation is the barred window, of which one pane opens. The lads in there now have a chess board set up on a table like the one Stewart snapped the leg from to kill Mubarek. They seem to get on. </p> <p>So did Stewart and Zahid, according to the wing officers, most of whom were traumatised by the death. \"When something like that happens the first thing you do is ask yourself, 'What more could I have done? Where there signs?' We saw his tattoo and you have hunches, but they honestly seemed to get on OK. They were together six weeks before he done it,\" says one officer. \"The guilt is crippling... and then you know someone will be along looking for a scapegoat.\" Narey, listening hard, nods in agreement, but while the director general chats to some lads, the officer opens up. \"We haven't the staff to get to know these lads properly. They're locked up 22-and-a-half hours a day then we unlock the doors. It can be like throwing a match into a box of fireworks.\" </p> <p>A senior officer at Feltham, with 12 years' experience, explains the hidden cost of staff shortages and sickness, which runs at 18.5 days a year per officer: the lack of personal knowledge of the prisoners. \"I remember once a colleague said to me one Saturday, 'Have you noticed Williams? Every weekend he's all tidy, his shoes are polished up and he's in his best gear. What's that all about?' It turned out every weekend he was waiting for a visit from his parents that never came. They used to visit but then they stopped. I looked into it and it turned out his parents had moved but the visiting orders were still being sent to the old address. We got them sent to the new address and they started visiting again. Things like that used to make the job worthwhile. The way we're going now we don't even have the time to realise we have got a fucking neo-Nazi thug in the same cell as an Asian lad.\" </p> <p>Narey acknowledges the problems and says he will address them. He knows officers are angry, but says he will sack those who \"swing the lead\". He gives the impression that every suicide in a British jail cuts deep. There were 94 last year and reducing that number is his top priority. He also wants a public debate about the role of prisons. \"A lot of people don't give a damn about what goes on inside prison walls, and only get engaged when they think we're running holiday camps. Well, I'd rather be criticised for giving them all a TV, for treating them well, than for being too harsh.\" </p> <p>Both Pascoe and Narey say they would like young offenders' institutions to be places where their own teenage sons would be treated fairly, should they get into trouble. One day Huntercombe young offenders' institution, high in the Chilterns near Reading, will be the sort of place they have in mind. At this juvenile-only establishment, governor Paul Manwaring has established a \"term\" system. Prisoners study employment skills - painting and decorating, bricklaying, car mechanics - for 10 weeks, then have a \"break week\" in which they take art, drama or music classes, culminating in a prize day and performances. </p> <p>Huntercombe is far from utopian, but in a resettlement class on the Mountbatten wing the fruits of the regime are apparent. Here, 10 kids within three months of release are taking a class aimed at preparing them for life on the outside. In contrast to many of the lads in the classrooms and on the wings both here and at Feltham, they are communicative and confident; they can see light at the end of the tunnel. Statistics say eight of them will be back, but for the moment they are looking forward, mainly to a McDonald's and to seeing their friends. The class volunteer and prison officer leave the room and I ask them if there is anything they want to say about prison. \"Can we really say anything and you'll put it in the paper?\" asks Frank. I nod. He grins and says: \"Tell all our parents, 'Hello from Huntercombe!' \"</p>",

      "bodyText": "When the Beat writer Jack Kerouac wrote a novella called Orpheus Emerged at the age of 23 in 1945, he can little have imagined that it would first be published on something called the internet. But the story he created - with its characters clearly based on fellow writers William Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg - finds its first public audience this week online rather than on the page. The short work comes from the Kerouac estate, which has gradually been selling off the remaining unpublished material it holds in the 10 years since the writer's third wife, Stella, died The purchaser in this case, an online publisher called LiveREADS, is in turn selling the novella through the website of the US book retailer Barnes &amp; Noble, where people can read a free screen extract of Orpheus Emerged. To download the little work in its entirety, however, costs $3.95 (\u00a32.80). The novella sheds more light on the young Kerouac. Admirers of his later work will be interested to see, for instance, that his tastes in literature as a young man were very traditional, ranging from the Oxford Book of English Verse to Dostoyevsky and Stendhal. Kerouac did not achieve fame until 1957 when his novel On the Road became a best-seller and established itself as the book to be stuffed into the back pocket of the jeans of every dreamer and backpacker in the world. He died in 1969 at the age of 47 after a rocky life but his books have enjoyed a revival in recent years. At the time Kerouac wrote Orpheus Emerged, he had just met Burroughs, Ginsberg, Lucien Carr and others in the world of Beat writers around Columbia University in New York. The roman \u00e0 clef is about a young man torn between his art and the other elements of his life. Kerouac wrote under the name of John. Publisher Paul Bresnick of LiveREADS has been quoted as saying: \"I was talking with Kerouac's estate and we agreed that a book this size would be perfect for our format.\" It will be two years before the work is available in paper form. The publishers have used more than 500 audio and video hyperlinks to cross-reference the text to everything from Nietzsche to the Beats and say that their aim is to make use of the medium in a way that will help explain Kerouac to a new generation by \"bringing reading to life\". Followers of Kerouac will not be surprised to discover that the main character in Orpheus Emerged smokes too much, is shabby and dishevelled and is fascinated and obsessed by the written word. Drop-out theme The theme of the book will also be familiar to anyone who has ever contemplated dropping out of university. After Orpheus Emerged, Kerouac went on to produce not only On the Road but The Dharma Bums, The Subterraneans, Dr Sax and Big Sur. While none of the latter works achieved the success of On the Road they are now studied in literature classes around the world. What Kerouac would have thought of the new venture is open to a discussion group of its own. Would he have thought, as he wrote in On the Road, that it was a case of \"the too huge world vaulting us\"? Or maybe he would have felt like his chief character in Orpheus Emerged and have identified with \"the ideas that rush through my mind\". Extract: 'Don't annoy me,' he hissed.

      "body": "<p>It has been labelled education's Sandhurst, although its elite tag is somewhat misleading. Today Tony Blair himself will launch the long-awaited National College for School Leadership designed, quite simply, to make heads and other senior teachers better at their jobs. </p> <p>The new college is one of the most ambitious education projects undertaken by a government which has made raising school standards central to its agenda. As the only one of its kind in the world, its influence will eventually extend beyond this country. </p> <p>Rather than being a military-style academy for a privileged elite of the estimated 30,000 serving heads in the UK, its courses and activities will be aimed at aspiring heads, deputy heads as well as heads of departments and other senior teachers - a potential audience of as many as 100,000 staff. In fact, \"the more the merrier\", as its director Heather du Quesnay, former director of education at Lambeth Council in south London, remarks. \"The more people we get involved, the more benefits there will be.\" </p> <p>Today it is the virtual side of the college which will get off the ground, with the launch of the new website which will establish an online learning community and network using pioneering new technology. </p> <p>Bricks and mortar will come later. At the moment the physical college is little more than a muddy hole on a hi-tech site on the Jubilee campus at Nottingham University. But the \u00a320m flagship headquarters is apparently on target to open its doors in May 2002, when it will offer residential training courses and seminars. Even then, however, it will have only a skeletal staff, (although admittedly with an impressive array of secondees) and the building will be a token presence for the development of the potentially much more exciting web-based activities. </p> <p>Despite the strong personal backing of the prime minister the idea, surprisingly, did not feature in Labour's election manifesto. But it was a key feature of the 1998 green paper which set out a wide-ranging package of measures to raise school standards. </p> <p>The feeling was that there are already many well-established staff and business colleges offering leadership programmes for the public as well as the private sector. Businessmen and women have the flagship MBA programme - so why not give head teachers an equivalent? </p> <p>Given that the job of the head teacher has changed beyond recognition over the last few years (and particularly in the face of the barrage of new school initiatives from Mr Blair's government), there seemed to be a strong case for honing leadership skills in particular, and developing the other qualities necessary to deliver education well into the 21st century. Another of the college's main purposes will be to provide a dedicated support structure for those moving into leadership positions within the teaching profession. </p> <p>As the prime minister will reveal today, despite the claims to the contrary by some of the teaching unions there has been a significant surge in the number of those wanting to become head teachers. The Department for Education and Employment believes that they have the right to expect help and advice on a proper career ladder. The college will also, sensibly, oversee the three separate strands of leadership training: the National Professional Qualification for Heads; the Headship Leadership and Management programme; and the Leadership Programme for Serving Heads. </p> <p>Communication and networking will be key to the virtual side of the college. The DfEE recognises that head teachers are busy people who may not get time to network. It believes the new technology will be instrumental in reducing the isolation of individual heads, particularly those working in rural communities who may have limited contact with other heads. </p> <p>It may be a tough job to persuade more traditionally-minded heads that they could be debating the finer points of the literacy strategy with a colleague 200 miles away on a Sunday afternoon, but anything is possible. The technology has been developed to be simple to use and geek-free, and flexible enough to use in the middle of the night if that's what takes a head's fancy. </p> <p>Last year 1,500 newly qualified heads were given free laptop computers and invited to take part in the pilot Talking Heads scheme, testing out the new technology. They have spent the last few month swapping ideas on good practice, chatting on a cafe site and generally feeling their way around the new system. </p> <p>A video clip of them, to be shown at the London conference for new heads where the college is being launched today, not surprisingly shows a generally positive response. Now heads will also be able to take part in hot seat debates featuring key educational figures (and even ministers) and lectures by well-known businessmen and leaders from other areas. BBC director general Greg Dyke, for example, has agreed to give a lecture. </p> <p>They will also be able to access a new Evidence Base - an archive of two dozen papers commissioned from the likes of Professor Tim Brighouse, with an interactive component allowing readers to comment on their usefulness. Virtual training courses will also be offered online, covering everything from follow-up after Ofsted inspections to presentational skills. In time it is hoped that the college will link up with leading business colleges such as Cranfield and Henley to offer joint programmes. </p> <p>The college itself has been broadly welcomed by the teaching unions, although not without the odd reservation. John Dunford of the Secondary Heads Association has warned of the dangers of trying to create identikit head teachers. Other education experts are sceptical about the online aspects of the college, and believe that it is hugely optimistic to expect heads to learn leadership from a laptop. Time will tell. </p> <p>\u0095 Rebecca Smithers is the Guardian's education correspondent. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:rebecca.smithers@theguardian.com\">rebecca.smithers@theguardian.com</a></p>",

In fact, \"the more the merrier\", as its director Heather du Quesnay, former director of education at Lambeth Council in south London, remarks. \"The more people we get involved, the more benefits there will be.\" Today it is the virtual side of the college which will get off the ground, with the launch of the new website which will establish an online learning community and network using pioneering new technology. Bricks and mortar will come later. At the moment the physical college is little more than a muddy hole on a hi-tech site on the Jubilee campus at Nottingham University. But the \u00a320m flagship headquarters is apparently on target to open its doors in May 2002, when it will offer residential training courses and seminars. Even then, however, it will have only a skeletal staff, (although admittedly with an impressive array of secondees) and the building will be a token presence for the development of the potentially much more exciting web-based activities. Despite the strong personal backing of the prime minister the idea, surprisingly, did not feature in Labour's election manifesto. But it was a key feature of the 1998 green paper which set out a wide-ranging package of measures to raise school standards. The feeling was that there are already many well-established staff and business colleges offering leadership programmes for the public as well as the private sector. Businessmen and women have the flagship MBA programme - so why not give head teachers an equivalent? Given that the job of the head teacher has changed beyond recognition over the last few years (and particularly in the face of the barrage of new school initiatives from Mr Blair's government), there seemed to be a strong case for honing leadership skills in particular, and developing the other qualities necessary to deliver education well into the 21st century. Another of the college's main purposes will be to provide a dedicated support structure for those moving into leadership positions within the teaching profession. As the prime minister will reveal today, despite the claims to the contrary by some of the teaching unions there has been a significant surge in the number of those wanting to become head teachers. The Department for Education and Employment believes that they have the right to expect help and advice on a proper career ladder. The college will also, sensibly, oversee the three separate strands of leadership training: the National Professional Qualification for Heads; the Headship Leadership and Management programme; and the Leadership Programme for Serving Heads. Communication and networking will be key to the virtual side of the college. The DfEE recognises that head teachers are busy people who may not get time to network. It believes the new technology will be instrumental in reducing the isolation of individual heads, particularly those working in rural communities who may have limited contact with other heads. It may be a tough job to persuade more traditionally-minded heads that they could be debating the finer points of the literacy strategy with a colleague 200 miles away on a Sunday afternoon, but anything is possible. The technology has been developed to be simple to use and geek-free, and flexible enough to use in the middle of the night if that's what takes a head's fancy. Last year 1,500 newly qualified heads were given free laptop computers and invited to take part in the pilot Talking Heads scheme, testing out the new technology. They have spent the last few month swapping ideas on good practice, chatting on a cafe site and generally feeling their way around the new system. A video clip of them, to be shown at the London conference for new heads where the college is being launched today, not surprisingly shows a generally positive response. Now heads will also be able to take part in hot seat debates featuring key educational figures (and even ministers) and lectures by well-known businessmen and leaders from other areas. BBC director general Greg Dyke, for example, has agreed to give a lecture. They will also be able to access a new Evidence Base - an archive of two dozen papers commissioned from the likes of Professor Tim Brighouse, with an interactive component allowing readers to comment on their usefulness. Virtual training courses will also be offered online, covering everything from follow-up after Ofsted inspections to presentational skills. In time it is hoped that the college will link up with leading business colleges such as Cranfield and Henley to offer joint programmes. The college itself has been broadly welcomed by the teaching unions, although not without the odd reservation. John Dunford of the Secondary Heads Association has warned of the dangers of trying to create identikit head teachers. Other education experts are sceptical about the online aspects of the college, and believe that it is hugely optimistic to expect heads to learn leadership from a laptop. Time will tell. \u0095 Rebecca Smithers is the Guardian's education correspondent. rebecca.smithers@theguardian.com",

      "bodyText": "Germany's chancellor Gerhard Schroder yesterday warned that not all national vetoes could be maintained within the EU, signalling more problems for Tony Blair at next month's Nice summit. Speaking in Brussels, Mr Schroder said insistence on retaining wide veto powers was untenable if the EU was to carry out the reforms it needs to take in new members over the next few years. \"Germany will ensure that everyone has to move and budge and needs to recognise that you cannot have national vetoes in all circumstances,\" he said after talks with the European commission president, Romano Prodi. Mr Schroder's remarks came as the pace quickened in negotiations on the Nice treaty and diplomats predicted that France - current holder of the EU's rotating presidency - would issue a new draft text in the next day or two. Paris has already made clear it is is not giving up attempts to move to more majority voting despite the obvious problems. Underlining the point, British officials rubbished a new Franco-German proposal for majority voting on tax matters - one of the contentious items Mr Blair has pledged to reject at Nice - as a tactical ploy that had no chance of being agreed. Ireland, Luxembourg and Sweden all share Mr Blair's refusal to surrendering the veto on tax. Britain also dismissed a French call for a proposed network of European public prosecutors, dubbed Eurojust and intended to enhance judicial cooperation, to be mentioned in the treaty. With the prime minister embroiled in a row over the new EU rapid reaction force and the domestic political temperature over Europe rising, his \"red lines\" at Nice seem more impassable than ever. Germany is a keen supporter of more majority voting, but it insists on keeping its veto on immigration and asylum matters. France wants to keep its veto in matters concerning trade in services and intellectual property. Majority voting is just one of the items that have to be resolved at Nice. The other main ones are trimming a top-heavy 20-member European Commission and re-allocating votes to member states to better reflect their relative size. These issues touch on the enormously sensitive question of how much power and influence governments have in policy-making, and were so difficult to resolve that they were left over after the 1997 Amsterdam treaty. Agreement is needed at the summit to avert paralysis in decision making as the union starts to admit up to a dozen new members, mostly from ex-communist eastern and central Europe.",

Camelot has since told Lord Burns it would buy up G-Tech's UK operation if it won the bid. </p> <p>\u0095 The world's largest independent maker of banknotes, De La Rue, which has a 27% stakeholding in Camelot, yesterday reported a 66% fall in pre-tax profits to \u00a327.7m for the six months to the end of September.

      "bodyText": "Camelot, which is battling to retain its National Lottery operating licence, yesterday announced that it had reversed a recent decline in ticket sales. But the operator also signaled that its profits for the full year would be adversely affected following the introduction of a variety of lottery-based games and increased marketing costs. The company said sales rose 4% to \u00a32.35bn in the 24 weeks to September 16 and were on track to reach its \u00a310.5bn target for so-called good causes. The announcement comes as the lottery commissioner, Lord Burns, today faces questions from the culture, media and sports select committee. Either Camelot or Sir Richard Branson's People's Lottery bid is expected to be awarded the seven-year licence by mid-December. Camelot spokesman Andrew Jones said that halting the decline in sales amounted to \"an endorsement of Camelot's game plan\". \"We know what we are doing when it comes to running a lottery,\" he said. \"We have a proven track record.\" Sir George Russell, the chairman of Camelot, said in a statement that the increase in ticket sales was the result of the promotion of the core game and the development of alternative products, such as Thunderball. \"Profits for the full year are expected to be adversely impacted by higher second half-year costs because of the introduction of two major games [Lottery Extra and Big Draw 2001] and higher marketing investment,\" he said. The group's results also revealed that sales of Instant scratch cards fell by 5.5% to \u00a3252m. Initial anxiety over the Camelot bid focused on the propriety of its main software supplier, US-based G-Tech, after attempts to cover up problems which left some winners short-changed. Camelot has since told Lord Burns it would buy up G-Tech's UK operation if it won the bid. \u0095 The world's largest independent maker of banknotes, De La Rue, which has a 27% stakeholding in Camelot, yesterday reported a 66% fall in pre-tax profits to \u00a327.7m for the six months to the end of September. Sales had decreased by 1% to \u00a3242.3m.",

On the down side, its speed makes it unlikely to survive beyond the heats. An essential site for the London build-up is operated by the magazine, Runner's World, at www.runnersworld.co.uk - it contains an excellent online race diary. The US Runner's World site has all the flaws and virtues of its compatriots, but is useful for its shoe reviews, which on the principle that anything happening in the US will shortly happen over here should be consulted for advance warning on any trainer turkeys. For those looking to for a local running club to give them help, company and motivation, www.runtrackdir.com/ukclubs is a good place to start searching. Most running clubs now have their own sites, although as they are infrequently updated and boast a design as racy as woodchip wallpaper, they tend to be useful only as a source of contacts. At www.serpentine.org.uk is a much more lavish effort that compares favourably with many commercial sites - its popularity can be gauged by the fact that it had 79,000 hits last month alone. Basically these are the home pages of the Hyde Park-based Serpentine Running Club but even non-Londoners will find it well worth bookmarking, since it boasts an excellent Beginner's Guide to Running, a treasury of articles by coaching legend Frank Horwill, a guide to London routes, a race planner and diary for races in the London area, and a London Marathon section. If you want to download a training log rather than just record distances and times in the traditional way in a dog-eared exercise book, one of the best is RunLog4Web (See www.pegasussoftware.com). Meanwhile, really keen runners, the sort whose trainers are the first thing to go into the suitcase when packing for a trip abroad, should bookmark the strangely compulsive www.runtheplanet.com, a runners' labour of love which offers descriptions of \"where to run and walk in the cities of the whole world, told by locals and for you to use while you are away from home\". Descriptions range from the blindingly obvious (\"In London you can go to any of the larger parks. Battersea Park is one of them.\") to some highly detailed and carefully thought-out routes, complete with distance and terrain. One feature of training for the London Marathon is the way it takes over your life. Rather than inflict your obsessive ruminations about weekly training mileage and the merits of sorbothane insoles on family, friends and colleagues, you should consider subscribing to an online mailing list. UKRunning at not only has an interesting selection of links to e-zines and e-commerce but will also invite you to subscribe to the UKRunning list, which has a membership of runners of all standards from tortoise to hare. Those who want more hardcore discussion of the London Marathon will find it on londonmarathon-subscribe@egroups.com. These are easily the runner's best source of online information, encouragement, humour and genuine help, all in a format that doesn't get you sacked at work for browsing the web all day long.",

      "body": "<p>Freeserve, the UK's largest internet service provider, could fall into French hands for less than \u00a32bn after confirmation yesterday that it was in talks which could lead to a takeover offer. </p> <p>Freeserve - 80% owned by the retailer Dixons - refused to name the parties with which it was in discussions but France Telecom subsidiary Wanadoo said Freeserve was one of the companies it had its eye on. </p> <p>If a deal were reached with Wanadoo or any other buyer, Freeserve admitted it would be forced to accept a relatively low offer compared to expectations only a few months ago. </p> <p>A formal statement said: \"The board has entered into discussions which may or may not lead to an offer being made for the company in shares. On the basis of yesterday's share prices it is unlikely that any such offer would be at a substantial premium to Freeserve's share price.\" </p> <p>Overnight speculation about a pending deal pushed Freeserve shares 13% higher to 165p but they ended the day up a mere 2.75p at 148.75p, still lower than their July 1999 float price. </p> <p>This level compares with a year high of 977p before the slide in technology stocks. Company sources said Freeserve would probably accept a 20-25% premium on the current share price to cement a deal. </p> <p>Freeserve broke off similar talks with T-Online, a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom, in June amid speculation the Germans would be willing to pay \u00a36bn. </p> <p>France Telecom admitted it was studying \"a large number of opportunities\" and admitted Freeserve was one of the companies in which it was interested. </p> <p>Dixons declined to comment on talks but sources said Wanadoo was only one of a number of interested parties which were in discussion with Freeserve. </p> <p>A deal between Wanadoo and Freeserve would double the size of each firm's subscriber base to a total of nearly 4m. </p> <p>Freeserve provides free internet access as well as a range of services via its web portal. Wanadoo, France's biggest ISP, sells books, wine and other goods on the web. </p> <p>Both companies have failed so far to expand successfully beyond their national boundaries and both have recognised they need large-scale investment to compete in new areas such as mobile phone access and instant messaging. </p> <p>In the three months to August Freeserve produced \u00a314.6m worth of turnover but made pre-tax losses of a similar size. Wanadoo floated on the Paris stock market four months ago. </p> <p>New of the talks between Freeserve and Wanadoo sent a shockwave through Energis investors who feared their company - part-owned by the National Grid - could lose important telecom contracts if Freeserve were bought. </p> <p>Energis shares fell 50.5p to 440.5p as the City worried that Wanadoo would want to switch some of the Freeserve traffic from Energis to NTL, with which it has a closer relationship. </p> <p>Energis moved to calm fears that it might lose any business. \"There should be no concerns - there is a contract in place between Energis and Freeserve,\" a company spokesman said.

      "bodyText": "Freeserve, the UK's largest internet service provider, could fall into French hands for less than \u00a32bn after confirmation yesterday that it was in talks which could lead to a takeover offer. Freeserve - 80% owned by the retailer Dixons - refused to name the parties with which it was in discussions but France Telecom subsidiary Wanadoo said Freeserve was one of the companies it had its eye on. If a deal were reached with Wanadoo or any other buyer, Freeserve admitted it would be forced to accept a relatively low offer compared to expectations only a few months ago. A formal statement said: \"The board has entered into discussions which may or may not lead to an offer being made for the company in shares. On the basis of yesterday's share prices it is unlikely that any such offer would be at a substantial premium to Freeserve's share price.\" Overnight speculation about a pending deal pushed Freeserve shares 13% higher to 165p but they ended the day up a mere 2.75p at 148.75p, still lower than their July 1999 float price. This level compares with a year high of 977p before the slide in technology stocks. Company sources said Freeserve would probably accept a 20-25% premium on the current share price to cement a deal. Freeserve broke off similar talks with T-Online, a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom, in June amid speculation the Germans would be willing to pay \u00a36bn. France Telecom admitted it was studying \"a large number of opportunities\" and admitted Freeserve was one of the companies in which it was interested. Dixons declined to comment on talks but sources said Wanadoo was only one of a number of interested parties which were in discussion with Freeserve. A deal between Wanadoo and Freeserve would double the size of each firm's subscriber base to a total of nearly 4m. Freeserve provides free internet access as well as a range of services via its web portal. Wanadoo, France's biggest ISP, sells books, wine and other goods on the web. Both companies have failed so far to expand successfully beyond their national boundaries and both have recognised they need large-scale investment to compete in new areas such as mobile phone access and instant messaging. In the three months to August Freeserve produced \u00a314.6m worth of turnover but made pre-tax losses of a similar size. Wanadoo floated on the Paris stock market four months ago. New of the talks between Freeserve and Wanadoo sent a shockwave through Energis investors who feared their company - part-owned by the National Grid - could lose important telecom contracts if Freeserve were bought. Energis shares fell 50.5p to 440.5p as the City worried that Wanadoo would want to switch some of the Freeserve traffic from Energis to NTL, with which it has a closer relationship. Energis moved to calm fears that it might lose any business. \"There should be no concerns - there is a contract in place between Energis and Freeserve,\" a company spokesman said. He refused to give details, but analyst Saeed Baradar of Bear Stearns said Energis told him it had a five-year deal until October 2003 to carry Freeserve's traffic. Meanwhile, Freeserve announced an exclusive deal to start a co-branded website with Kodak to provide online picture processing plus online storage of digital pictures.",

The Light Surgeons, a group of UK filmmakers, graphic designers and DJs are delighting a large crowd of young, fashionable (mostly) west Berliners at the former state bank of the GDR. </p> <p>The group is dazzling its audience with an audio-visual extravaganza that marked the end of a seven-day digital film festival in the city last Saturday night. </p> <p>The festival, the work of onedotzero, claims to be the largest of its kind in the world. Onedotzero showcases the best of new media, computer games and digital film. The festival drags cutting-edge work created for PCs and consoles and launches it onto the cinema screen. And in the case of the Light Surgeons, it is completely live. </p> <p>The Light Surgeons mix bits of film, computer graphics, music and photography in the way DJs mix dance records. They have grown up in clubs in London, providing the visuals for chill out rooms, but now they want to take their work to another level and have started including bits of narrative in their latest work, Electronic Manoeuvres. Although most of the audience in Berlin stood up and talked freely during last Saturday's performance, Electronic Manoeuvres is a kind of documentary - albeit one that you are unlikely to have seen the likes of before. </p> <p>Part road movie, part critique on consumerism, the new work moves from the London Underground to Vegas and then into outer space. The Light Surgeons were let loose with digital camcorders in the US earlier this year. They recorded stories told by the homeless and began weaving them into the mix. It is a new style of film, they say, one they refer to as 'exploded documentary'. </p> <p>\"We're like a media circus,\" says Chris Allen, the group's founder member. \"We use a digital camcorder, Super 8, photography and bits of audio we've recorded ourselves. I think digital film has given people like us a way of approaching film that is different from traditional ways.\" </p> <p>Like much of the onedotzero programme, Electronic Maneuvers is digital film - but it's not the kind that you find on the web. Even though the festival features much of the best work by the UK's up-and-coming new media practitioners, it has so far shied away from producing an online version. Rather, the festival is a showcase for the visual landscape we can expect on the net in the coming months and years. </p> <p>Matt Hanson and Shane Walter founded the festival in 1996. A former film critic and theatre producer respectively, they have taken onedotzero to 25 cities worldwide, including Taipei, Melbourne, Barcelona and Nottingham. In addition to the festival, the pair are currently curating a TV series for Channel 4 and planning something called a 'remixable film' to be distributed over the net sometime next year. The Berlin festival also included presentation from two of the UK's leading new media design agencies, State and recent Bafta winner Digit. Other highlights include the screening of introductory sequences from computer games such as Munch and Tekken Tag Tournament 3. </p> <p>\"As well as commissioning and producing work we have developed an audience that didn't exist before,\" says Walter. \"In the first couple of years of the festival, people would ask us how we could programme TV advertising alongside graphic designers and architects and illustrators. Now I think people are really understanding what convergence means and understand that there is a need for a festival like this.\" </p> <p>Co-founder Matt Hanson concurs: \"What a lot of people have tried to do is take a traditional film and squeeze it into a narrow bandwidth. What we've done is go the other way, and taken non-traditional film into the cinema.\" </p> <p>The Light Surgeons are all in their mid-20s, but it is not just the young who are taking to new forms of moving image. More experienced designers are finding a new lease of life by moving across into so-called 'time based' work. Andy Martin, a 40-something illustrator, showed his work at the first onedotzero, and has been a feature of the festival ever since. </p> <p>\"As the tools have been arriving there has been almost a stampede in the design world of people picking them up and looking to experiment with them,\" says Martin. \"Some are looking purely at the commercial potential of digital film. \"Others, including myself, are just looking to find new ways of expressing ourselves.\" </p> <p>Apple, for one, hopes desktop editing will do for it what desktop publishing did for the company the 1980s. Each Apple computer now comes with iMovie, a basic desktop editing application that has been used to produce work for onedotzero. </p> <p>Hanson and Walter say that they are now inundated with offers of work to show at their festival. And they expect much more as designers, filmmakers, photographers and budding Light Surgeons move across many different forms of new media.

Britain stopped exporting contaminated cattle feed to Europe in 1991 (though we continued sending it to the third world until 1996). In most other EU countries cases have already peaked and declined, as expected.</p> <p>But in France, the number of infected animals has doubled in the last year. It is impossible to see how this pattern could result from the export of British bone meal.</p> <p>The simple fact is that the transmission of BSE has never been satisfactorily explained by the prevailing theory. The consumption of meat and bone meal from infected cows has doubtless had an important role to play. Yet this explanation alone fails to account for the huge numbers of cattle in Britain which continued to become infected after most contaminated feed had been removed from the food chain. The latest research on the human form of the disease, nvCJD, published three weeks ago, failed to find any link with the consumption of infected beef.</p> <p>You might have imagined that when its theory isn't working, a government would wish to test the alternatives. But the British administration has, so far, sought only to attack a hypothesis which does appear to fit the facts. Since 1988, a Somerset farmer called Mark Purdey has been arguing that scientists have overlooked the root causes of BSE. Self-taught and self- financed, he has mastered the brain's complex biochemical pathways and this year published a groundbreaking paper in a respected medical journal.

      "bodyText": "The most interesting aspect of France's BSE scandal is that it makes no sense at all. Britain stopped exporting contaminated cattle feed to Europe in 1991 (though we continued sending it to the third world until 1996). In most other EU countries cases have already peaked and declined, as expected. But in France, the number of infected animals has doubled in the last year. It is impossible to see how this pattern could result from the export of British bone meal. The simple fact is that the transmission of BSE has never been satisfactorily explained by the prevailing theory. The consumption of meat and bone meal from infected cows has doubtless had an important role to play. Yet this explanation alone fails to account for the huge numbers of cattle in Britain which continued to become infected after most contaminated feed had been removed from the food chain. The latest research on the human form of the disease, nvCJD, published three weeks ago, failed to find any link with the consumption of infected beef. You might have imagined that when its theory isn't working, a government would wish to test the alternatives. But the British administration has, so far, sought only to attack a hypothesis which does appear to fit the facts. Since 1988, a Somerset farmer called Mark Purdey has been arguing that scientists have overlooked the root causes of BSE. Self-taught and self- financed, he has mastered the brain's complex biochemical pathways and this year published a groundbreaking paper in a respected medical journal. His reward is to have been reviled, misrepresented and physically attacked. Prions, the brain proteins whose alteration seems to be responsible for BSE, are designed to protect the brain from the oxidising properties of chemicals activated by dangerous agents such as ultra- violet light, Purdey argues. When, he suggests, the prion proteins are exposed to too little copper and too much manganese, the manganese takes the place of the copper the prion normally binds to. This means that the protein becomes distorted and loses its function.

At a press conference to publicise the report by the science and technology committee into in-flight conditions, Lord Winston, a leading consultant, said: \"We understand very well that mass air travel has had a liberating influence on our society... but there may need to be some cost involved with the implementation of the report. \"It may well be that flying too cheaply is potentially too risky and there may well have to be a trade-off.\" His warning was backed by Michael Davies, a former director of health at British Airways and specialist adviser to the committee, who suggested that people should accept that long haul flights could become the preserve of the rich. He said: \"Ideally, everyone should have a first class seat at an economy price.\" But he added that it was more realistic that passengers would have to pay for more leg room and wider seats. Last night, the airline industry criticised the comments by pointing out that the report itself found that deep vein thrombosis (DVT) - dubbed \"economy class syndrome\" - was just as likely to strike first and business class passengers. \"The report clearly says that \"economy class syndrome\" is a total misnomer: the risks apply to everyone and it is sitting around for a long time which causes the risk,\" said Roger Wiltshire, secretary general of the British Air Transport Association, which represents several of Britain's airlines. A spokeswoman for Britannia Airways, which offers charter flights to the United States and Caribbean, added that many customers preferred not to fork out an extra \u00a3120-\u00a3195 for up to 6in more legroom. \"Some of our extra leg room seats remain empty: for whatever reason, some of our passengers aren't prepared to pay the extra,\" she said.

Yesterday, the committee said taking low doses of aspirin, drinking water, avoiding alcohol and exercising during flights could reduce the risk of developing the condition. The report also controversially suggested that long coach and rail journeys held similar risks.

But Treasury ministers are now planning to table concessions in the form of an amendment. They are also going to table separate amendments stating the civil aviation authority pension scheme trustees will not be legally liable in any dispute over the pension fund. The trustees had been preparing to spend \u00a31m to take the government to court over their liability. Lord Brett is awaiting details of the amendments, but warns the government could just still face defeat on Monday if the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats marshall their forces. If the government is defeated, its business managers will rush the bill back to the Commons to reverse the defeat a second time, provoking a constitutional clash. The issue would then be returned for a third Lords vote later in the week. Ministers have to settle the issue quickly with time running out for the current parliarmentary session before the Queen's speech opening a new one on December 6. A poll showed yesterday that the majority of voters want Nats to remain in public hands. The NOP survey showed that 62% of the public disagree with the selling off of part of the Nats, according to the poll of 1,000 people. Just 21% favour partnership proposals and only 11% believe it should be fully privatised, the study for ITN's Powerhouse programme, screened on Channel 4, revealed.",

In his pre-Budget report, the weirdo chancellor made much of this welcome electoral bribe (the allowance rises by \u00a350 to \u00a3200), telling the Commons: \"I can confirm that the cheques are being sent out from Monday.\"</p> <p>Well, he can bleedin' well unconfirm it because that Monday was November 13 and the cheques have not turned up yet. Pensioners swamping a special phone line in Cardiff are eventually told by recorded message: \"If you are waiting for your cheque, you will get it by Christmas Day.\" This is a very poor show, especially with a freezing snap predicted soon. We can all comb black shoe polish into our temples, but what doth that profiteth our fellow man if we come over all Arthur Daley - \"It's in the post, love, honest, I posted it meself\" - with pensioners' extra fuel money?</p> <p>\u0095 The conspiracy theory of the week comes courtesy of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, which is suspected by the BBC of rigging its jackpot win for ratings reasons. Winner Judith Keppel was once married to Neil Shand, the comedy writer, it goes, who used to write for Jasper Carrott, a part-owner of Celador, the TV production company that makes Who Wants To Be A Millionaire. It's absolute rubbish, of course. But it's our rubbish.</p> <p>\u0095 It's always a pleasure to resurrect an old favourite, and today we take Another Trip Down Memory Lane with Gus. He may swoon now at the idea of renationalising the railways, but Transport Minister Lord Macdonald once thought differently. Collecting a Political Studies Association award for World In Action on Tuesday in front of Edward Heath, Margaret Beckett and others, Granada's Ian McBride recalled how, when Gus was running the station, he used to tell his programme makers to \"make the viewers sit up at the back\"; and to \"comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable\". Isn't that very Mr Tony? I bet Gus trots that out every week at cabinet.</p> <p>\u0095 Speaking of Gus, I am hoping to launch my new board game, Turncoat Olympics, in time for Christmas 2001. Using dice, cards with printed quotes stacked in two piles called Now and Then and coins (pieces of silver), players can gauge how well ministers are doing at abandoning once-cherished principles in return for gaining high office. Anyone experienced in board game design, preferably for Waddingtons, should get in touch.</p> <p>\u0095 In the Mirror, gout-ridden working-class warrior Paul Routledge recalls the end of Thatcher. \"I was glad that she was out, for one plain and simple reason,\" he writes. \"She destroyed Arthur Scargill and the NUM.\" How odd this seems from someone who once compared Arthur Scargill to Nicolae Ceausescu, and wrote so scathing an unauthorised biography in 1993. As for Lady Thatcher, you'd have thought Gouters would thank her for changing the home rental laws in favour of the landlord; or landlady in this case, what with all those Yorkshire properties being in the name of Mrs Routledge.

      "bodyText": "\u0095 There is no word as to when Gordon Brown plans to concede that he is dyeing his hair, partly perhaps because the Treasury is busy with a nascent public relations disaster concerning the extra winter fuel allowance for pensioners. In his pre-Budget report, the weirdo chancellor made much of this welcome electoral bribe (the allowance rises by \u00a350 to \u00a3200), telling the Commons: \"I can confirm that the cheques are being sent out from Monday.\" Well, he can bleedin' well unconfirm it because that Monday was November 13 and the cheques have not turned up yet. Pensioners swamping a special phone line in Cardiff are eventually told by recorded message: \"If you are waiting for your cheque, you will get it by Christmas Day.\" This is a very poor show, especially with a freezing snap predicted soon. We can all comb black shoe polish into our temples, but what doth that profiteth our fellow man if we come over all Arthur Daley - \"It's in the post, love, honest, I posted it meself\" - with pensioners' extra fuel money? \u0095 The conspiracy theory of the week comes courtesy of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, which is suspected by the BBC of rigging its jackpot win for ratings reasons. Winner Judith Keppel was once married to Neil Shand, the comedy writer, it goes, who used to write for Jasper Carrott, a part-owner of Celador, the TV production company that makes Who Wants To Be A Millionaire. It's absolute rubbish, of course. But it's our rubbish. \u0095 It's always a pleasure to resurrect an old favourite, and today we take Another Trip Down Memory Lane with Gus. He may swoon now at the idea of renationalising the railways, but Transport Minister Lord Macdonald once thought differently. Collecting a Political Studies Association award for World In Action on Tuesday in front of Edward Heath, Margaret Beckett and others, Granada's Ian McBride recalled how, when Gus was running the station, he used to tell his programme makers to \"make the viewers sit up at the back\"; and to \"comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable\". Isn't that very Mr Tony? I bet Gus trots that out every week at cabinet. \u0095 Speaking of Gus, I am hoping to launch my new board game, Turncoat Olympics, in time for Christmas 2001. Using dice, cards with printed quotes stacked in two piles called Now and Then and coins (pieces of silver), players can gauge how well ministers are doing at abandoning once-cherished principles in return for gaining high office. Anyone experienced in board game design, preferably for Waddingtons, should get in touch. \u0095 In the Mirror, gout-ridden working-class warrior Paul Routledge recalls the end of Thatcher. \"I was glad that she was out, for one plain and simple reason,\" he writes. \"She destroyed Arthur Scargill and the NUM.\" How odd this seems from someone who once compared Arthur Scargill to Nicolae Ceausescu, and wrote so scathing an unauthorised biography in 1993. As for Lady Thatcher, you'd have thought Gouters would thank her for changing the home rental laws in favour of the landlord; or landlady in this case, what with all those Yorkshire properties being in the name of Mrs Routledge. Ungrateful beast. \u0095 There is no room today for step two of my mother's recipe for chicken soup. This will appear tomorrow. In the meantime, please follow step one and buy a large kosher boiling chicken in readiness. Those of you living in particularly goyishe areas can make do with an organic boiler. \u0095 In Lausanne, Switzerland, German tourist Hermann Roeg miraculously survived a fall from the window of his 8th floor hotel room with no more than a broken ankle but died after he fell out of the ambulance taking him to hospital and under the wheels of a bus. diary@theguardian.com",

Efforts by rebels to use an emergency party congress on Saturday to oust him now look set to collapse, so that it will be Mr Milosevic who leads the party into crucial elections for the Serbian parliament next month. Though he lost the Yugoslav presidency after his election defeat and a popular uprising this autumn, the main power in the country rests with the Serbian authorities rather than those of the Yugoslav Federation which Serbia dominates. Whichever party wins the December election will have ultimate control. When plans were laid, in the aftermath of last month's uprising in Belgrade, for an emergency congress of the Socialist party of Serbia (SPS), Mr Milosevic's critics hoped to use the momentum that forced his shock departure from the Yugoslav presidency to dump him as party chief. But from his private villa in the elite Belgrade suburb of Dedinje, Mr Milosevic has been rallying his supporters over the telephone or by summoning them to meetings. He is thought to make occasional forays into town in small cars with tinted windows. The party congress this weekend is to take place in the Sava Centre, a large conference hall in the suburb of New Belgrade, but Serb journalists said yesterday that no details have been given as to whether the press will be allowed in or if Mr Milosevic will attend.

Now he too is planning to form his own party and says he may not even attend the congress. \"If I thought I could serve any purpose, I would come,\" he said. \"But, as matters stand, my presence would not facilitate a democratic dialogue.\" Mr Vucelic belongs to a group calling itself the \"SPS founders\", which has been calling for Mr Milosevic to resign in favour of a temporary secretariat to run the party. The group includes another former Yugoslav president, Borislav Jovic, and the former head of the Belgrade branch of the party, Slobodan Jovanovic. None of these men is a liberal and most were involved in the virulent nationalism of the early 1990s during the wars with Croatia and Bosnia.

Hundreds of \"love hotels\", usually favoured by couples for romantic trysts, will be requisitioned for football fans because the city's tourist and business hotels do not have enough capacity for the surge in demand expected in 2002. The controversial accommodation policy has been drawn up by Seoul municipal authorities who have been wondering what to do about the bed shortage in the city. Official estimates suggest that Seoul faces a shortfall of 20,000 rooms during the tournament, when almost a million football supporters are expected. With the economy still wobbling slowly out of the Asian financial crisis, South Korea cannot afford to construct new facilities for visitors as it did for the 1988 Seoul Olympics. However, the love hotel industry is booming and has more than enough capacity to handle the overspill. Earlier this week, Seoul city hall said that it would nominate 370 of them as \"world inns\" with upgraded booking systems and translation services. It is a move that ought to be welcomed by football fans. As well as being far cheaper than regular hotels, love hotels offer an intriguing insight into a different culture. Although less gaudy than their more famous Japanese counterparts, South Korean love hotels feature the same combination of convenience and privacy for couples looking to do anything but sleep. They offer discreet parking and short-term rates for a one- or two-hour stay in rooms, some of which are lined with mirrors or fitted with water- or vibrating beds. Many also supply condoms, pornography and sex toys. In recent years, love hotels have proliferated in urban areas, where space and privacy are in short supply. Part of the reason for their growth is that so many young single people remain at home with their parents, but some people see the explosion as a sign of decadence. In recent weeks there has been a growing backlash by Christian groups and residents' associations, who claim that such facilities are undermining the nation's morals by encouraging extra-marital affairs and sexual promiscuity among teenagers. Some protesters have taken photographs of people and cars entering the love hotels and posting them on the internet. By redesignating them as world inns and making them perform more of a social function in providing accommodation for visiting football fans, Seoul city officials hope to soothe this controversy. \"The latest measure is aimed at killing two birds with one stone,\" said a municipal official quoted in the Korean Herald. \"We can help to resolve the dire shortage of lodging facilities during the World Cup as well as finding a good use for love hotels, which have become a source of headaches in the capital.\" It remains to be seen, however, how enthusiastic love hotel owners will be about the plan, which will mean they only let their rooms once a night instead of four or five times.",

Also going to market is Datamonitor, the market research company which specialises in the technology and health care sectors. The move will turn chairman Mike Danson's initial \u00a35,000 investment into a stake worth approximately \u00a346m, and value the London-based company at \u00a3116m. Datamonitor, which was formed in 1989, is raising funds in order to expand in the Far East and Europe. Mr Danson said: \"Our strategy has been to develop high quality data and powerful expertise to help our global blue-chip client base take advan tage of market and technological developments.\" Trading is due to begin on November 29. Finally there is Genetix, which makes robotic equipment for use in gene discovery. The company is raising around \u00a327m - of which \u00a317m will be used for expansion and \u00a310m will go to existing backers, who are selling some of their shareholdings. The shares have been placed with institutions at 150p each, valuing Genetix at \u00a3112m. The company is said to be looking for acquisitions and also wants to develop its sales and marketing in the US and to expand in Asia.",

Citigroup refused to return calls yesterday. </p> <p>The younger Mr Weill blamed exhaustion for his decision to leave his job managing the firm's $113bn (\u00a380bn) investment portfolio in July. His departure, following an extended leave of absence, raised eyebrows as the division had been performing well. </p> <p>Colleagues had already started to notice signs of erratic behaviour from a man known for working 12-hour days in the shadow of his father. According to the Wall Street Journal, Mr Weill dozed off during important meetings, some of which were led by his father. He also took days off and was hospitalised twice within four months, suffering with pneumonia. On his return to the company, colleagues noticed that his fingertips were stained brown. Their concerns prompted an investigation, according to the newspaper. </p> <p>The personal revelations come as a blow to Sandy Weill, whose company is expected to make more money than any other business this year. </p> <p>Citigroup was formed from the merger of Travelers and Citibank almost three years ago. It owns the Salomon Smith Barney and Schroders investment banks as well as several retail businesses. </p> <p>Mr Weill's promotion of his children is understood to have caused some resentment in the company. </p> <p>His daughter, Jessica Bibliowicz, quit in 1996 after falling out with Jamie Dimon, a rising star in the business. Mr Weill was reportedly furious that his second-in-command had blocked his daughter's path to a senior job.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Cocaine addiction, long regarded as a hidden menace on Wall Street, prompted the departure of one of the financial world's most high-profile executives, according to reports yesterday. Marc Weill, a senior manager with Citigroup and the son of its chairman, Sandy, stepped down from his $2m-a-year job as head of the group's investment business earlier this year because of his drug dependency, according to the Wall Street Journal. The newspaper quoted E D Donahey, Mr Weill's former wife, saying that the 44-year-old father of two was \"in treatment for drug addiction\". \"The only thing that's important is that Marc is getting help for his drug addiction,\" said Ms Donahey, who is understood to have remained close to the Weill family after her divorce in 1995. Neither Marc nor Sandy Weill has commented on the reports or speculation about the alleged addiction. Citigroup refused to return calls yesterday. The younger Mr Weill blamed exhaustion for his decision to leave his job managing the firm's $113bn (\u00a380bn) investment portfolio in July. His departure, following an extended leave of absence, raised eyebrows as the division had been performing well. Colleagues had already started to notice signs of erratic behaviour from a man known for working 12-hour days in the shadow of his father. According to the Wall Street Journal, Mr Weill dozed off during important meetings, some of which were led by his father. He also took days off and was hospitalised twice within four months, suffering with pneumonia. On his return to the company, colleagues noticed that his fingertips were stained brown. Their concerns prompted an investigation, according to the newspaper. The personal revelations come as a blow to Sandy Weill, whose company is expected to make more money than any other business this year. Citigroup was formed from the merger of Travelers and Citibank almost three years ago. It owns the Salomon Smith Barney and Schroders investment banks as well as several retail businesses. Mr Weill's promotion of his children is understood to have caused some resentment in the company. His daughter, Jessica Bibliowicz, quit in 1996 after falling out with Jamie Dimon, a rising star in the business. Mr Weill was reportedly furious that his second-in-command had blocked his daughter's path to a senior job.",

      "body": "<p>In the 12 months from January 1973 to January 1974, the London stock market fell by a third. From there over the next year it fell by a further 60%. Britain was in crisis, and share prices said as much. </p> <p>Older City hands recall the numbing effect of turning up at the office each day only to watch the market ratchet lower once again and another client go bust. Twenty-six years on, the younger breed of London stockbrokers must be experiencing strange tinglings in their fingers and toes. Numbness could be setting in. </p> <p>The headline eco-stats do not point to crisis. But with the nation's transport infrastructure disintegrating and this season's fashion pages full of mauves and unlikely greens, the 70s revival now includes a 70s-style market crunch. </p> <p>It is not a crash in the sense predicted by those alarmed at the collapse of the US savings rate and its runaway trade deficit. But wealth is disappearing fast and confidence at some stage will follow. </p> <p>Bar a couple of hundred points, the Nasdaq composite index has halved in value this year. The same is true of Britain's frothy Techmark 100. In broad terms, the more established equity indices - the Dow Jones and the FTSE 100 - have been travelling sideways for 20 months. </p> <p>US investors have lost $4,000 billion since the spring peak and, most worryingly, a third of that has been blown away in the past two weeks. So much for western stock markets celebrating the most sustained period of economic expansion on record. </p> <p><strong> EU's poison pill </strong><br> </p> <p> Meanwhile, over in the foreign exchange markets, the euro has been wobbling along as usual. The currency's supporters seem quite sanguine about its lack of short-term progress, alive to the fact that its level against the dollar is being dictated by the legal quagmire into which the US presidency has sunk. </p> <p>But there remain plenty of longer-term reasons to question the euro's chances of a swift recovery. Take the debate being held in the European parliament's legal affairs committee yesterday, where an amendment has been tabled to Article 9 of the EU's directive on takeover rules. It seeks to allow firms \"poison pill\" defences against takeovers without asking their shareholders. At the extreme, the move could make hostile bids all but impossible across the continent; at best it could tie up takeovers in years of litigation. </p> <p>The move has appalled the UK's Takeover Panel, whose code is generally held up as a model for EU legislation. Instead, after 10 years of wrangling, a crucial practical measure embodying investor protection - giving shareholders the right to override management on the question of whether their business should be sold - is in danger of being thrown out.

      "bodyText": "In the 12 months from January 1973 to January 1974, the London stock market fell by a third. From there over the next year it fell by a further 60%. Britain was in crisis, and share prices said as much. Older City hands recall the numbing effect of turning up at the office each day only to watch the market ratchet lower once again and another client go bust. Twenty-six years on, the younger breed of London stockbrokers must be experiencing strange tinglings in their fingers and toes. Numbness could be setting in. The headline eco-stats do not point to crisis. But with the nation's transport infrastructure disintegrating and this season's fashion pages full of mauves and unlikely greens, the 70s revival now includes a 70s-style market crunch. It is not a crash in the sense predicted by those alarmed at the collapse of the US savings rate and its runaway trade deficit. But wealth is disappearing fast and confidence at some stage will follow. Bar a couple of hundred points, the Nasdaq composite index has halved in value this year. The same is true of Britain's frothy Techmark 100. In broad terms, the more established equity indices - the Dow Jones and the FTSE 100 - have been travelling sideways for 20 months. US investors have lost $4,000 billion since the spring peak and, most worryingly, a third of that has been blown away in the past two weeks. So much for western stock markets celebrating the most sustained period of economic expansion on record. EU's poison pill Meanwhile, over in the foreign exchange markets, the euro has been wobbling along as usual. The currency's supporters seem quite sanguine about its lack of short-term progress, alive to the fact that its level against the dollar is being dictated by the legal quagmire into which the US presidency has sunk. But there remain plenty of longer-term reasons to question the euro's chances of a swift recovery. Take the debate being held in the European parliament's legal affairs committee yesterday, where an amendment has been tabled to Article 9 of the EU's directive on takeover rules. It seeks to allow firms \"poison pill\" defences against takeovers without asking their shareholders. At the extreme, the move could make hostile bids all but impossible across the continent; at best it could tie up takeovers in years of litigation. The move has appalled the UK's Takeover Panel, whose code is generally held up as a model for EU legislation. Instead, after 10 years of wrangling, a crucial practical measure embodying investor protection - giving shareholders the right to override management on the question of whether their business should be sold - is in danger of being thrown out. When commentators refer to the need to restructure European industry the presumption is that it will get rid of such reactionary corporate measures, not introduce new ones. Here's the beef The hospitality industry is really much tougher than it looks - as both Basil Fawlty and Nigel Wray have discovered to their cost. It must have seemed a delicious idea two years ago for Mr Wray and his Notting Hill friends to go into the restaurant business, capitalising on the success of Damien Hirst's Pharmacy. After all, the place is constantly packed with wealthy diners clad in polo necks, grazing on focaccia while discussing the virtues of nouvelle vague cinema. However, as City analysts were quick to point out yesterday, the service industry is no place for amateurs. Particularly at upmarket establishments, one minor lapse can deter a customer for life.

Colours illuminate the night: crimson, sapphire and gold. </p> <p>This is how John Piper marked the bombing of the Commons on May 10 1941. The German air raid started fires across London and killed 1,436 people. Piper's paintings of the Blitz stay in your mind. He was a self-consciously minor artist, with a depressive nostalgic love for old England. </p> <p>But when he was sent as an official war artist to paint historic buildings destroyed by German bombing, Piper found his perfect subject. As a show of his work at the Imperial War Museum demonstrates, he became the Canaletto of the Blitz, recording the ruins of London and Coventry with the same precision that the 18th-century painter brought to the canals of Venice. </p> <p>This is not so much a tribute to Piper as to the war art scheme he worked for. John Piper: The Forties serves as an introduction to the vast archive of official painting created by state-employed artists who recorded, in a traditionalist, romantic style, the gothic horrors of the Blitz. Piper was directed to paint bombed architecture by the War Artists' Advisory Committee, set up in 1939. </p> <p>Everything during the war was centrally organised. Even creativity was directed from above. Thirty artists were put on salary; others received specific commissions. By the end of the war 5,570 works of official art had been produced. Art historians have tended to be sceptical about their quality. </p> <p>Yet John Piper: The Forties reveals that some artists did their best work for the WAAC. Far from producing undifferentiated propaganda pulp, it knew just who to send where. While Piper painted architecture, Laura Knight recorded the lives of women workers. </p> <p>Today artists strain to imagine apocalyptic horrors; these artists didn't have to. The Britain of 1940-41 faced a real apocalypse. How did artists respond? With images of green fields and ancient churches. </p> <p>This is the art of a fortress island, looking into its past and its countryside as a symbol, in the context of a threatened invasion. This is where war paintings tell us more than photographs, because art is a document of the collective imagination. A painting of a V1 over a field quotes Constable, it quotes the history of Romantic landscape art. </p> <p>The story of British art in wartime is part of a wider convulsion that defined the nature of art in the second half of the 20th century. Art all over the world became more nationalist in the 40s. The International Style of pre-war modernism gave way to art that was aggressively local. Piper, Graham Sutherland, Henry Moore and their followers broke drastically with continental modernism, but went in the other direction. </p> <p>The imagination of Britain became inward-looking as people dug down to survive the Blitz. This is rawly visible in Piper's paintings with their anguished love of nature and of architecture so old and solid it has become part of the landscape. </p> <p>Piper became famous after the war as the champion of the old against the ugly new. Although in the 30s he was an abstract painter, Piper was already turning towards the British rural past as shadows spread across Europe; in 1940 and 1941, painting the bombed hulks of Coventry Cathedral and London churches, he became a devout worshipper of what remained of the old Britain. In 1942 he published his manifesto, British Romantic Painters. His art and that of Sutherland, Ivon Hitchens and John Minton came to be called Neo-Romantic. </p> <p>At the Imperial War Museum this movement's relics are part of a vast archive of war art, some on display and the rest available online or on request. About 2,000 works of official second world war art ended up here, as well as the far better-known avant-garde art of the first world war. </p> <p>All kinds of artists painted the war - realists as well as romantics, Royal Academicians as well as intellectuals. Artists went abroad with British forces; three official war artists were killed. Yet it was the imagery of the British landscape under attack in the Battle of Britain and then later from V1 and V2 attacks in 1944-45 that created the most haunting art. </p> <p>Women were prominent on this other home front. In Eve Kirk's Remains of St Nicholas Cole Abbey, London EC4, the twisted ruins of blitzed London are populated by tiny figures crawling over a damaged world. The sky is clear but specked with silver barrage balloons. In this painting, formal traditionalism and belief in the British tradition of landscape and topographic art collides with undreamt of destruction. </p> <p>CJ Pearce's painting, Crashed Aeroplane in Devon, is a similarly nostalgic image of the British landscape. Green grass rolls up into a smoky sky, the horizon marked by a row of grey trees. The only thing wrong is that the smoke comes from a burning plane, as firemen rush uphill to try to save the pilot. </p> <p>War appears in these paintings as a surreal disturbance of the British landscape. Leslie Cole's painting of gunners bringing down a doodlebug in the marshes outside London has the V1 in flames over a brown English marsh. </p> <p>In AM Weston's A Wrecked Barrage Balloon at Dulwich Station the deflating form of the balloon descends on railway lines like a Salvador Dal\u00ed dream as the night sky burns orange, while in Knight's A Balloon Site, Coventry, blue-uniformed ATS women haul on ropes to get one of these soft monsters into position. Before the war, Dal\u00ed came to lecture in London. In wartime paintings, the more scrupulous the realism with which life is depicted, the more it turns into dream images. </p> <p>War's surrealism fed the imagination of the painter who was to create the most significant art of the period. Francis Bacon's Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion (c. 1944) in Tate Modern depicts blind, malformed beasts perched in an airless interior. </p> <p>The only thing they have in common with Knight's balloon is their physical perversity. The gothic regression of the Neo-Romantics is taken up and transformed into something terrible; where Piper painted Coventry Cathedral as a still-noble ruin, Bacon's medieval triptych is populated by gargoyles. It shocked viewers when shown in an exhibition with Sutherland and Moore in 1945. This was the underside of Romanticism, a return to the middle ages. </p> <p>More in tune with how the nation saw itself at war were Moore's drawings of sleepers in London's underground stations. Moore's figures have the resilience of tomb sculptures. He made them for the WAAC after observing the way people behaved in makeshift tube shelters. These bodies are de-individualised. They lie together, allowing danger to pass overhead. It's a vision of a community of survival. </p> <p>The art of the second world war explains so much about what came after. Modern art was shut out of the national imagination not just because of conservatism. The British turned to their past because, in 1940, that was all they had.

      "body": "<p>Whenever I'm trying to fill an hour of stand-up, the last thing I'm wondering is, \"Jeez, will this set land me a spot on television?\" The reasons are twofold: first, I do what makes me laugh, otherwise I get bored; second, I've done stand-up on television and it ain't the apex of my career. Television producers and editors seem to have an uncanny knack for siphoning the humour out of just about anything, especially the royals, and particularly the pretty, dead ones. </p> <p>Yet television comedy is seen as a move up for a comic. I guess that's because if you can't get a TV profile going, your live shows in the provinces don't sell very well. To be on any television programme, though, your set must be \"clean\". </p> <p>Which means few or no dirty words. Misogyny within social norms, fine, but save the word cunt for the wife-beatings, mate. That's right. No cunts, although the halls of the BBC are teeming with them. Which is sad, since cunt is plainly the most versatile word in the English language. It's a verb, a noun, an adjective, and the one word that, no matter how it's used, makes my mother angry. One is also discouraged from using the word fuck, particularly as a verb. Particularly if you're gay. </p> <p>See, as an out cocksucker, there are lots of things I can get away with on stage, but on television I'm perceived as dangerous. In rehearsals, TV companies treat me as though I'm retarded, or a child or, worse yet, American. \"Please be nice, Mr Capurro. You want the people watching to like you, don't you?\" </p> <p>Then they go through the litany of words I'm not supposed to use. When the show is edited, other comics' \"fucks\" are left in. Mine are removed. After all, being gay is dirty enough. Do I have to be dirtier with my dirty mouth? </p> <p>I'm not really complaining. I've learned to manoeuvre my way through television. I can play the take-the-cock-out-of-my-mouth-and-press-the-tongue-to-my-cheek game with the rest of them. Usually. </p> <p>But in Australia, during the taping of a show in Melbourne, I described Jesus as a \"queer-wannabe\". I saw papers fly up over the heads of the audience. Later I found out it was the director's script. Apparently they found him, huddled in a corner, crying like a new prisoner who'd just taken his first \"shower\". </p> <p>He was afraid I'd pollute minds. At least, that's what he told his assistant. So now TV is promoting itself as a moral barometer? A big-eyed nanny looking out for our sensitive sensibilities? </p> <p>In the six years I've been performing in the UK, I've seen political correctness catch on like an insidious disease, like a penchant for black, like the need to oppress. Comics use the term to describe their own acts during TV meetings, and everyone nods in approval. Or are they choking? I can never tell with TV people. </p> <p>Yet no one really understands the meaning behind political correctness, the arch, highbrow stance it panders to. The phrase was coined as a reaction to racism in the US, a belated substitute for the kindness that was stifled when hippies disappeared.</p> <p>PC took the place of sympathy, which has, since Reaganomics, had a negative, \"girly\" tone to it. Being politically correct makes the user feel more in control, because they can manipulate a conversation by knowing the proper term to describe, say, an American Indian. </p> <p>\"They're indigenous peoples now,\" a talk show host in San Francisco told me on air recently. \"The word Indian is too marginal.\" </p> <p>\"But where are they indigenous to?\" </p> <p>\"Well, here, of course.\" </p> <p>\"They're from San Francisco?\" </p> <p>\"No. I mean yes. My boss\" - the producer, Sam - \"was born and raised here, but his parents are Cherokee from Kansas. Or was it his grandparents?\" </p> <p>\"My grandfather is Italian, from Italy. What does that make me?\" </p> <p>\"Good in bed.\" </p> <p>Indigenous, tribal, quasi or semi. All these words are used to describe, politely, \"the truth\". But, strangely enough, the truth is camouflaged. The white user pretends to understand the strife of the minorities, their need for acceptance, when all the minorities require is fair pay. I've never met a struggling Costa Rican labourer who was concerned that he be called a Latino as opposed to a Hispanic. He just wants to feed his family. Actually, I've never met a struggling Costa Rican. But that's because I'm one of the annoying middle class who keep a distance from anyone who's not like them, but have the time and just enough of an education to make up words and worry about who gets called what. </p> <p>To the people we're trying to protect, we must appear naive and bored, like nuns. Ours is a tolerance that has become intolerant. As if to say: \"If you don't think this way - if you don't think that a black person from Bristol is better off being called Anglo-African - you're not only wrong, you're evil!\" It's fascism, plain and simple. </p> <p>Suddenly it's naughty to make jokes about blacks unless you're black, and bad to make fun of fat people unless you're fat. Everyone is tiptoeing around everyone else, frightened they'll be labelled racist if they use the word Jew in a punchline. Somehow we've forgotten that it's all in how you say it. These words are not \"racist\" or \"dangerous\" by definition. </p> <p>Speaking of definitions, let's talk about the word gay. Lots of people I meet are concerned about what I should be called. Is it gay, which pleases the press, or queer, which pleases the hetero hip, since they think gays are trying to reclaim that word? </p> <p>The fact is that both words are straight-created identifiers. Gay is a heterosexual concept. It's a man who looks like a model, dresses like a model and has the brain of a model. He has disposable income, he loves to travel, and he adores - sometimes thinks he is - Madonna. He's a teenage girl, really, and straights love objectifying him the way they do teenage girls. Or infants. Try watching a diaper commercial with the sound off. It's like porn. </p> <p>I'm about as comfortable with the word \"gay\" as I am with kiddie porn. I'd prefer to be called a comic. Not a gay comic. Not a queer comic. Not even a gay, queer comic, or a fierce comic, or an alternative comic. It's just the mainstream trying to pigeonhole me, trying to say, OK, he's gay, so it's OK to laugh at his stuff about gays. Which is why, partially, in my act, I make fun of the Holocaust: \"Holocaust, schmolocaust, can't they whine about something else?\" </p> <p>The line is meant to be ambiguous, initially. It's meant to start big, and then the actual subject gets small, as I discuss ignorance about the pink triangle as a symbol of oppression, which has since been turned into a fashion accessory. Like the red ribbon, which makes the PC brigade feel they've done their part to ease hatred in the world by adorning their lapel with a pin. When asked, they're not even sure what oppression they're curing, or how they are oppressed. </p> <p>But if you make fun of that triangle, or this Queen Mum, or that dead princess, suddenly you're - why mince? I'm the bad guy. I'm not acting like a good little queer should. I'm not being silent about issues that don't concern a modern gay man. I'm being aggressive. And those straights, those in charge, the folks looking after \"my minority group\", don't like rolling over. </p> <p>Who decides what I can and cannot say? Isn't it the people that aren't listening? If I've got a good joke and a point to make, why is it bad? Why not just do my same old weenie jokes, keep playing the clubs and sleeping with closeted straight comics? Just doing those three things - particularly the last - would keep me busy and distracted, which is what \"life\" is all about. </p> <p>But I imagine that when people go for a night out, they want to see something different. It's a big deal finding a babysitter, getting a cab, grabbing a bite and sitting your tired ass on a pricey seat to hear some faggot rattle on for an hour. So I try to offer them a unique perspective. One that might seem overwrought, desperate or strangely effortless, but also might make them look at, say, an Elton John photo just a bit differently next time. </p> <p>It's not my job to find anyone's comfort zones. I don't give a shit what people like, or think they like, or want to like. I'm not a revolutionary. I'm just a joke writer with an hour to kill, who wants to elevate the level of intelligence in my act to at least that of the audience. If in doing that, I get a beer thrown at me or lose a \"friend\" (read: jealous comic), so be it. In the meantime I'll keep fending off my growing array of fans who are sick and tired of being lied to and patronised. </p> <p>\"Gosh, get her !\" Get me, sounding all holier than, well, everybody. Strangely enough, the more I find my voice on stage, the more serious comedy becomes for me. Maybe I should go back to telling those \"Americans are so silly\" jokes before I lose my mind and throw all my papers in the air.</p> <p>\u0095 This is an edited version of an article from Index on Censorship's next issue, The Last Laugh, published tomorrow, price \u00a38.99.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In the biggest challenge to international sanctions so far, Iraq has begun pumping oil to Syria through a long-disused pipeline, Arab sources said yesterday. Diplomats accused Iraq of illegally attempting to export 200,000 barrels of oil a day through the pipeline, which has been out of action since 1982. This would more than double Iraq's illegal oil sales, currently thought to total around 150,000 barrels a day. A Foreign Office spokesman in London said oil exports to Syria would deprive ordinary Iraqis of humanitarian support if they were conducted outside the UN's oil-for-food programme. \"Revenues would go to the pockets of the regime to purchase their luxuries, and not to the Iraqi people,\" he said. Under UN resolutions, a new export route through Syria or anywhere else would have to be approved by the security council's sanctions committee. Although the Foreign Office has asked Syria to confirm or deny claims that the pipeline has reopened, it was still awaiting a reply yesterday. \"It is not clear yet that Syria intends this to be outside the oil-for-food programme,\" the spokesman said. According to yesterday's issue of the Saudi-owned newspaper, al-Hayat, Iraq and Syria have a written agreement \"to participate in lifting the sanctions against the Iraqi people without infringing security council resolutions\". This is ambiguous because Iraq claims that, due to a loophole in the rules, the oil for Syria would not be an infringement. The oil would not be sold directly on the open market. Instead, Syria would refine the Iraqi oil for its domestic use - which, in turn, would allow Syria to export an equivalent amount of its own oil to the Mediterranean market. That device would allow Iraq to claim that its arrangements with Syria were no different from those with two other neighbours - Jordan and Turkey - which are already allowed to receive Iraqi oil outside the oil-for-food programme. The attitude of western diplomats is that the oil supplies to Jordan and Turkey are technically illegal, though nothing has been done to stop them, and the quantities involved are small. Iraq says that these cases are covered by Article 50 of the UN Charter, which suggests that special arrangements can be made for countries that suffer knock-on effects of the sanctions against Iraq, and that Syria would fit into the same category. An Iraqi spokesman hinted yesterday that oil supplies could soon start going to Lebanon too. A branch of the pipeline runs through to the Lebanese port of Tripoli, north of Beirut.",

      "body": "<p>Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the slum parish priest once hailed as the democratic saviour of impoverished Haiti, is expected to sweep back to power this weekend in a presidential election conducted amid random violence.</p> <p>All of the Caribbean nation's main opposition parties have withdrawn their candidates in protest at disputed counting of votes in May's parliamentary election, which handed overwhelming victory to the ruling Fanmi Lavalas party, led by Father Aristide.</p> <p>The Organisation of American States, which monitored but refused to ratify those polls, has declined to oversee this presidential race.</p> <p>Campaigning has been low key. Father Aristide, 47, who is now married with two daughters, has not spoken in public since October 9, when he registered his candidacy. He has become reclusive, receiving visitors in his walled 40-acre estate on the outskirts of the capital, Port-au-Prince. His Aristide Foundation for Democracy website was last updated in November 1999.</p> <p>Since the United States sent in 20,000 troops in 1994 to remove the leaders of a military coup and restore the ousted President Aristide, Haiti, traditionally the poorest country in the Americas, has repeatedly disappointed the hopes of the international community.</p> <p>Father Aristide stood down in 1996, in one of the country's rare instances of a peaceful transfer of power. Despite his popularity, Titid, as he is known, was barred from standing for immediate re-election under a strict constitutional provision - designed to prevent the re-establishment of dictatorships - which outlawed consecutive presidential terms.</p> <p>The president argued he was entitled to serve three years lost in exile, but international pressure forced him to hand over power to his protege, Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val.</p> <p>The scramble for votes in the American presidential election, where naturalised Haitian refugees were among those criticising electoral irregularities in Florida, has overshadowed the Haitian poll and undermined US disapproval.

      "bodyText": "Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the slum parish priest once hailed as the democratic saviour of impoverished Haiti, is expected to sweep back to power this weekend in a presidential election conducted amid random violence. All of the Caribbean nation's main opposition parties have withdrawn their candidates in protest at disputed counting of votes in May's parliamentary election, which handed overwhelming victory to the ruling Fanmi Lavalas party, led by Father Aristide. The Organisation of American States, which monitored but refused to ratify those polls, has declined to oversee this presidential race. Campaigning has been low key. Father Aristide, 47, who is now married with two daughters, has not spoken in public since October 9, when he registered his candidacy. He has become reclusive, receiving visitors in his walled 40-acre estate on the outskirts of the capital, Port-au-Prince. His Aristide Foundation for Democracy website was last updated in November 1999. Since the United States sent in 20,000 troops in 1994 to remove the leaders of a military coup and restore the ousted President Aristide, Haiti, traditionally the poorest country in the Americas, has repeatedly disappointed the hopes of the international community. Father Aristide stood down in 1996, in one of the country's rare instances of a peaceful transfer of power. Despite his popularity, Titid, as he is known, was barred from standing for immediate re-election under a strict constitutional provision - designed to prevent the re-establishment of dictatorships - which outlawed consecutive presidential terms. The president argued he was entitled to serve three years lost in exile, but international pressure forced him to hand over power to his protege, Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val. The scramble for votes in the American presidential election, where naturalised Haitian refugees were among those criticising electoral irregularities in Florida, has overshadowed the Haitian poll and undermined US disapproval. President Clinton's call for Haiti to remedy the \"serious irregularities and deficiencies evident in the May elections\" has effectively been ignored. In the runup to the presidential election, there have been numerous gun attacks but without any claims of responsibility. Earlier this month, 10 people were killed in the space of 24 hours in Port-au-Prince and incendiary devices were thrown into election council buildings. In Gonaives, Haiti's second city, gunmen on a motorcycle riddled an empty UN vehicle with bullets last week. To add to the atmosphere of insecurity, six senior policemen fled across the border to the Dominican Republic several weeks ago after being accused of plotting to assassinate Father Aristide, President Pr\u00e9val and the prime minister, Jacques-Edouard Alexis. The officers, who included the police chief from the northern city of Cap-Haitien, were alleged to have been planning a coup. The opposition parties hope that their decision to pull out of this weekend's race will raise questions about the legitimacy of the contest. \"This election is a masquerade,\" said Calixte Dorisca, an independent candidate who withdrew earlier this month. Another candidate, Evans Nicolas, said he would not run in an election marred by violence, allegations of unfairness and voter apathy. \"We want a balanced elections council, not one loaded with Aristide partisans,\" Mr Nicolas said. But the elections council has said it is too late for candidates to withdraw because their names are already on ballot papers for the more than 4m people registered to vote. Fanmi Lavalas mayors in several towns have recently been accused of harassing anti-government protesters. A British charity, Action Aid, has expressed concern about its work supporting coffee growing in the town of Thiotte, after its staff were told not to criticise the government. \"We aim to promote the democratic process but we were called in by the local mayor. If our right to express our views is now in jeopardy, then this is becoming like the early years of the Duvalier regime,\" said the charity's regional coordinator, Helen Collinson. More than half of Haiti's population of 8m are illiterate, and 5% of the workforce are thought to be infected with the Aids virus. But despite the country's poverty, many foreign donors have withdrawn, or threatened to withdraw, funding from Haiti in protest at the political climate.",

Deborah married the Duke of Devonshire and has made the estate at Chatsworth a commercial success (and even opened a shop in Belgravia, on Elizabeth Street).

Dressed in a tightly belted Balmain jacket and skirt, pearl earrings, her silver hat held in place by a velvet band, she is just as striking as she was when she was the focus of the world's media.</p> <p>In her sunny Left Bank apartment, filled with the scent of lilies, books lie everywhere. \"I stole a book once,\" she suddenly confides, \"from Holloway Prison.\" She is barely able to contain her delight. \"Would you like to see it?\" From a drawer, she produces a small, red, cloth-bound copy of the complete works of Racine in French. The prison librarian had catalogued the book with two words in pencil: \"Classic. Dull.\"</p> <p>Diana Mosley was imprisoned for three and a half years in June 1940 for \"spousal association\". A year later, her husband was moved from Brixton to Holloway, to join her. Blithely she recalls their time there: \"It was the sunshine and warmth I missed most.\" One hot day, they stripped off to sunbathe in the tiny concrete yard. The prison priest caught sight of them. \"It's like the Garden of Eden out there - Lady Mosley in her little knickers,\" he told a warden.</p> <p>Sir Oswald was Diana's second husband. At the age of 18, she married the Hon Bryan Guinness, of the brewing dynasty. The diarist James Lees-Milne wrote at the time of her engagement that she was \"a goddess, more immaculate, more perfect, more celestial than Botticelli's sea-borne Venus\", while an infatuated Evelyn Waugh thought her beauty \"ran through the room like a peal of bells\".</p> <p>She would dine with Lady Colefax and weekend at Chartwell with her cousins Clemmie and Winston Churchill. Lytton Strachey was her neighbour (she described him as \"cleverness incarnate\"), and a present from Dora Carrington, a collage made of coloured silver-foil sweet wrappers, now hangs in her room in Paris.</p> <p>Through friends who were to remain faithful throughout her life, such as Waugh, Sir Harold Acton, Lord Berners and Sir John Betjeman, she was to enjoy the intellectual company she craved. Amazingly, all these relationships survived her later marriage to Mosley and their joint imprisonment.</p> <p>More than half a century on, she is still eager to hear the latest literary gossip from London. She is thrilled by the indiscretions in James Lees-Milne's recently published posthumous volume of diaries; avid for the latest on Martin Amis and curious to hear about David Hare's new play. She expresses horror at the inadequacy of the US presidential candidates and dismay at William Hague's Euroscepticism. She is au courant. Only deafness impedes her; she relies on the fax machine which whirs continually in the background.</p> <p>Diana met \"my fate\" in 1931, at the age of 21. From the first encounter with Sir Oswald Mosley she \"followed him politically, absolutely blindly\". She also fell in love with him: \"I knew it would never end, except with death. Never, never was I unfaithful.\" She didn't expect the same from him, a man who had slept with most of his first wife's best friends and even her sister. \"I knew fidelity wasn't in his nature; if he had fallen for someone's mind I should have cared much more.\"</p> <p>In 1933, Diana began to make regular visits to Germany where, with her younger sister Unity, she met Hitler. He was entranced by her and Unity, and described them as \"angels\", while she found him \"extremely clever, incredibly frank and wonderful, charming. We were very great friends. But I didn't love Hitler any more than I did Winston.\" Does that mean, then, that she loved Hitler? \"I was very fond of him. Very, very fond.\"</p> <p>On October 6 1936 Diana and Mosley were secretly married in Joseph Goebbels's drawing room. Hitler came to the wedding and gave her a photograph of himself in an eagle-topped silver frame. I asked her where it is now. \"I put it in a parcel in a bank when the war began because I thought it might hurt people's feelings.</p> <p>I think I've got the little chit somewhere.\" While Hitler's present remains hidden in the safe of a Staffordshire bank, the 22 volumes of the works of Goethe, inscribed to \"Liebe Diana\", which the Goebbels gave her on her wedding day, sit in the small library of her Paris apartment.</p> <p>Until August 1939, Diana spent long evenings alone with Hitler in his hotel in Berlin, trying to persuade him to let her set up a commercial English-speaking radio station, the advertising revenue from which would help fund the BUF.</p> <p>She says that the subject of the Jews never came up. \"I never heard him mention them; I know that he didn't like them, that he hated them, that he murdered them...\" She hesitates; her hands flutter in front of her but her blue eyes hold my gaze unwaveringly. \"Maybe instead they could have gone somewhere like Uganda: very empty and a lovely climate.\"</p> <p>On the Mosleys release from prison in November 1943, on the grounds of Oswald's ill-health, Diana remembers queuing up in the local bank. When people reached the head of the queue, they would begin all over again, just to be able to continue staring at her. \"I am a famous awful person,\" she laughs without a hint of apology. Even now, the British embassy in Paris is forbidden to invite her to any function there. She was never reconciled with her sister Jessica. The communist and fascist schism between them was too deep.</p> <p>Since the death of her husband in 1980, she has relied on her family. Four children, 14 grandchildren, 20 great-grandchildren, their husbands and wives and her remaining sister Debo provide her with support. They all came to her 90th birthday party in June. She remains an icon to the handful who still hold her late husband's beliefs. A photograph taken on her birthday shows her sitting among 17 mild-looking, red-faced, grey-suited elderly members of BUF, not a boot or black shirt between them, who travelled to Paris on the Eurostar to raise a glass to her.</p> <p>Diana Mosley feels in no way exiled. Nor is she lonely. Although most of her friends have died, her apartment has become a place of pilgrimage for historians and for those who are simply curious. The old woman who still exudes a powerfully seductive charm, who loved Hitler and Churchill equally and was in turn loved by them, continues to arouse a mixture of reverence and horrors.</p> <p>\u00a9 Juliet Nicolson/Tatler/The Cond\u00e9 Nast Publications Ltd.

The prison priest caught sight of them. \"It's like the Garden of Eden out there - Lady Mosley in her little knickers,\" he told a warden. Sir Oswald was Diana's second husband. At the age of 18, she married the Hon Bryan Guinness, of the brewing dynasty. The diarist James Lees-Milne wrote at the time of her engagement that she was \"a goddess, more immaculate, more perfect, more celestial than Botticelli's sea-borne Venus\", while an infatuated Evelyn Waugh thought her beauty \"ran through the room like a peal of bells\". She would dine with Lady Colefax and weekend at Chartwell with her cousins Clemmie and Winston Churchill. Lytton Strachey was her neighbour (she described him as \"cleverness incarnate\"), and a present from Dora Carrington, a collage made of coloured silver-foil sweet wrappers, now hangs in her room in Paris. Through friends who were to remain faithful throughout her life, such as Waugh, Sir Harold Acton, Lord Berners and Sir John Betjeman, she was to enjoy the intellectual company she craved. Amazingly, all these relationships survived her later marriage to Mosley and their joint imprisonment. More than half a century on, she is still eager to hear the latest literary gossip from London. She is thrilled by the indiscretions in James Lees-Milne's recently published posthumous volume of diaries; avid for the latest on Martin Amis and curious to hear about David Hare's new play. She expresses horror at the inadequacy of the US presidential candidates and dismay at William Hague's Euroscepticism. She is au courant. Only deafness impedes her; she relies on the fax machine which whirs continually in the background. Diana met \"my fate\" in 1931, at the age of 21. From the first encounter with Sir Oswald Mosley she \"followed him politically, absolutely blindly\". She also fell in love with him: \"I knew it would never end, except with death. Never, never was I unfaithful.\" She didn't expect the same from him, a man who had slept with most of his first wife's best friends and even her sister. \"I knew fidelity wasn't in his nature; if he had fallen for someone's mind I should have cared much more.\" In 1933, Diana began to make regular visits to Germany where, with her younger sister Unity, she met Hitler. He was entranced by her and Unity, and described them as \"angels\", while she found him \"extremely clever, incredibly frank and wonderful, charming. We were very great friends. But I didn't love Hitler any more than I did Winston.\" Does that mean, then, that she loved Hitler? \"I was very fond of him. Very, very fond.\" On October 6 1936 Diana and Mosley were secretly married in Joseph Goebbels's drawing room. Hitler came to the wedding and gave her a photograph of himself in an eagle-topped silver frame. I asked her where it is now. \"I put it in a parcel in a bank when the war began because I thought it might hurt people's feelings. I think I've got the little chit somewhere.\" While Hitler's present remains hidden in the safe of a Staffordshire bank, the 22 volumes of the works of Goethe, inscribed to \"Liebe Diana\", which the Goebbels gave her on her wedding day, sit in the small library of her Paris apartment. Until August 1939, Diana spent long evenings alone with Hitler in his hotel in Berlin, trying to persuade him to let her set up a commercial English-speaking radio station, the advertising revenue from which would help fund the BUF. She says that the subject of the Jews never came up. \"I never heard him mention them; I know that he didn't like them, that he hated them, that he murdered them...\" She hesitates; her hands flutter in front of her but her blue eyes hold my gaze unwaveringly. \"Maybe instead they could have gone somewhere like Uganda: very empty and a lovely climate.\" On the Mosleys release from prison in November 1943, on the grounds of Oswald's ill-health, Diana remembers queuing up in the local bank. When people reached the head of the queue, they would begin all over again, just to be able to continue staring at her. \"I am a famous awful person,\" she laughs without a hint of apology. Even now, the British embassy in Paris is forbidden to invite her to any function there. She was never reconciled with her sister Jessica. The communist and fascist schism between them was too deep. Since the death of her husband in 1980, she has relied on her family. Four children, 14 grandchildren, 20 great-grandchildren, their husbands and wives and her remaining sister Debo provide her with support. They all came to her 90th birthday party in June. She remains an icon to the handful who still hold her late husband's beliefs. A photograph taken on her birthday shows her sitting among 17 mild-looking, red-faced, grey-suited elderly members of BUF, not a boot or black shirt between them, who travelled to Paris on the Eurostar to raise a glass to her. Diana Mosley feels in no way exiled. Nor is she lonely. Although most of her friends have died, her apartment has become a place of pilgrimage for historians and for those who are simply curious. The old woman who still exudes a powerfully seductive charm, who loved Hitler and Churchill equally and was in turn loved by them, continues to arouse a mixture of reverence and horrors. \u00a9 Juliet Nicolson/Tatler/The Cond\u00e9 Nast Publications Ltd.

      "body": "<p>Los Angeles, spring 2000. A bright-eyed executive sits behind his/her desk in the glass-fronted offices of Dreamworks - the entertainment conglomerate founded by arch-moguls David Geffen, Jeffrey Katzenberg and Steven Spielberg - scouring for stories to turn into movie magic.</p> <p>It's a bad week for ballsy single parents triumphing against the odds; a go-slow for cute puppies saving their owners from certain doom. Then he/she chances on the latest missive from satirical website The Onion. </p> <p>Tenth Circle Added To Rapidly Growing Hell declares the headline, above an account of the underworld's upsizing to accommodate new legions of the damned: besides the flatterers and simonists, space has now been found for the publicists, award-show hosts and \"media whores\". The executive makes a call, then strikes a deal. And suddenly America's darkest, most biliously inspired comic talents are playing footsie with Hollywood. </p> <p>On paper, it looks implausible. In reality, the story's transformation from sly gag to potential blockbuster still has its author, Onion head writer Todd Hanson, reeling. \"I guess stranger things have happened\", he ponders. \"But not to us.

      "bodyText": "Los Angeles, spring 2000. A bright-eyed executive sits behind his/her desk in the glass-fronted offices of Dreamworks - the entertainment conglomerate founded by arch-moguls David Geffen, Jeffrey Katzenberg and Steven Spielberg - scouring for stories to turn into movie magic. It's a bad week for ballsy single parents triumphing against the odds; a go-slow for cute puppies saving their owners from certain doom. Then he/she chances on the latest missive from satirical website The Onion. Tenth Circle Added To Rapidly Growing Hell declares the headline, above an account of the underworld's upsizing to accommodate new legions of the damned: besides the flatterers and simonists, space has now been found for the publicists, award-show hosts and \"media whores\". The executive makes a call, then strikes a deal. And suddenly America's darkest, most biliously inspired comic talents are playing footsie with Hollywood. On paper, it looks implausible. In reality, the story's transformation from sly gag to potential blockbuster still has its author, Onion head writer Todd Hanson, reeling. \"I guess stranger things have happened\", he ponders. \"But not to us. When the call first came in we were laughing hysterically, just because the idea of Dreamworks wanting this sounded so much like one of our jokes.\" He's dead right. With its overtones of blank surrealism, the entire concept could have come straight from the archives Hanson's helped build since the then-shoestring operation started rolling in Madison, Wisconsin 12 years ago. Alongside \"Christ Announces Hiring Of Associate Christ\", \"Man With Heart Disease Eagerly Awaits Young Boy's Death\", and the definitive \"Christopher Reeve Placed Atop Washington Monument\", the notion of Spielberg's stormtroopers climbing into bed with The Onion's immaculate cynics would have slotted in nicely. But the irony doesn't end there. With Hanson hired as scriptwriter (\"Yup, they're sucking me into the whirling maelstrom with them\"), Dreamworks' plans for the finished product involve animation and - a deep breath may be advisable here - musical singalongs. Hanson knows how it sounds. \"You'd like to hope it won't end up completely toothless,\" he says dolefully. \"But I'm prepared for the possibility that by the time it comes out it'll be the story of a super-intelligent killer whale and a sickly child who learns to love again.\" In a sense, Tinseltown's attentions were inevitable. To its million-plus readers, The Onion represents a much-needed scalpel jabbing at the flabby underbelly of America's self-image. To the comedy industry, however, it's buzzword heaven: hip, edgy, and - most importantly - young, an ascendant brand name to be bought and sold like Saturday Night Live and National Lampoon before it. Diversification doesn't frighten the staff - their books, The Onion's Finest News Reporting and Our Dumb Century, have already hogged the bestseller list, while editor-in-chief Rob Siegel speaks enthusiastically of venturing into movies and TV under The Onion banner. All the same, he's aware of the horrors lurking in the entertainment shark-tank. \"We definitely want to move into other mediums, but we get prickly when we're told how to be funny. So the only way we could do it would be to have total control. We've had a lot of meetings with Hollywood people, and what usually happens is they tell us how much they love what we do right before they become the experts on how to do it.\" In other words, the \"edge\" to which the business pays such ardent lip service is precisely what makes Siegel and company such a risky investment. Because, while they can do pathos, and even a strange, twisted variant on sweet, what The Onion does best is the kind of scabrous deadpan that, as Hanson points out, most execs are \"paid to eliminate on sight\". Somehow - entertaining as the idea may be - you can't imagine studio chiefs salivating over \"Teachers Are Appalled By Poorly-Written Teen Suicide Notes\" or \"Stephen Hawking Builds Robotic Exo-Skeleton\". Equally, although various alumni have graduated to the likes of Futurama and Buffy The Vampire Slayer, the fiercely independent staff of mid-Western college drop-outs hardly fit the profile of the career-minded Ivy Leaguers typically found on the networks' payroll. The last writer Siegel took on was poached direct from a sandwich shop. \"We try not to hire rich kids from Harvard,\" he explains, \"which is the source of most TV comedy writers.

Will it be mushrooms, fried onion rings? You'll have to wait and see\", so the titles of Friends For Dinner (BBC2) muse \"Is it Jamie? Could it be Gary? Ainsley? It might be Rick?\" It is none of the above, for that is the noise of the barrel bottom being scraped. Yes, it's Antony Worrall Thompson. Now, if he turned up at my front door, I'd do what my granny used to do when the nuns came round collecting for charity - hide under the window. As it was, Stuart, who was indeed having friends for dinner, let AWT in and so began a strange affair between an odd couple. \"I like his cooking and he seems like a nice man\", Stuart said, hardly bubbling with enthusiasm. Obviously, he was still miffed that he got AWT and not JO - that's Jamie Oliver to you - to help him dans la cuisine. Mind you, had he got his mitts on Jamie, Stuart and his chums probably would have attempted to spit roast the Naked Chef. And that's not something you want to see on national television. Thus, it was leek and roquefort quiche, chocolate and prune terrine and chargrilled squid on AWT's menu. Or more accurately, straight out of a recipe book. Be still, my beating imagination. Stuart and Antony went shopping. Back at Stuart's house things got really icky when it came to squid preparation.

It is not a train, but Nasa's long-planned Pluto-Kuiper Express probe. </p> <p>The only planet yet to be visited by a spacecraft, and so the one we know least about, is Pluto. This is hardly surprising. We've known of it for but a fraction of a Pluto year. Since it was discovered in 1930 Pluto has traversed little more than a quarter of its loop around the Sun, a complete orbit taking 248 of our years. </p> <p>Tiny Pluto - only two-thirds the size of our Moon - plods around the frigid depths of space, never coming within 2.7 billion miles of the Sun. But it's not alone. In 1978 a moon of Pluto was discovered, and named Charon. Unlike most moons it is large compared to its parent. Pluto is about 1,475 miles across, Charon a little more than half that, at 750 miles. Astronomers tend to think of the two as a binary planet, taking a little over six days to pirouette around each other. </p> <p>More recently, a host of other cosmic lumps have been found in their vicinity. Since 1992 astronomers have spotted more than 300 minor planets, typically 100 miles or so in size, slowly circuiting the sun beyond Neptune. This is called the Kuiper belt, after the Dutch-American astronomer who suggested its existence in 1950. The plan was for the Pluto-Kuiper Express (PKE) space probe to fly past Pluto, then visit several Kuiper belt objects. </p> <p>Express seems a misnomer when interplanetary journeys can take decades. Nasa's Voyager 2 probe, launched in 1977, arrived at Neptune in 1989. Even that required boosts from successive fly-bys of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus. The plan is to launch PKE in 2004. An encounter with Jupiter in 2006 will use its gravitational slingshot action to throw the satellite on to a high-speed trajectory reaching Pluto in 2012. </p> <p>That plan has its drawbacks. When it gets to Pluto, PKE will be travelling at 12 miles per second, and so will whiz by, providing only a series of snapshots rather than a prolonged period of data collection. It is not feasible to give PKE an adequate rocket booster to stop it at its destination. </p> <p>The other problem is that Jupiter has to be in the right place if PKE is to use its gravity to accelerate. Jupiter will be positioned correctly until 2015 at the earliest. PKE would then reach Pluto in 2022. The researchers, who have invested a decade in planning PKE, would by then be superannuated. </p> <p>PKE's timetable is set by celestial mechanics. If it does not fly in 2004, it may be left standing for a dozen years. Someone might invent a novel propulsion technique that will work far from the Sun, but nothing could be cheaper than a free gravity assist from Jupiter in 2006. </p> <p>This seems a compelling case, if the last unexplored planet is to be reconnoitred in the near future. Enter the reality of limited budgets, and vested interests. The Nasa hierarchy says the agency cannot afford the $600m PKE would cost to build for a 2004 launch. Instead the order has been given to concentrate on a mission to Europa, one of the four large moons of Jupiter. </p> <p>Here critics think that Nasa is bowing too low to public opinion, which is bedazzled by the prospect of life elsewhere. Detractors say astrobiology is the only science with nothing to study, although it hits the headlines frequently, such as in 1996 when Nasa announced the possible identification of microfossils in a meteorite from Mars. </p> <p>Why Europa? It is largely made of ice. Many scientists think it likely that Europa has an ocean beneath the frozen crust now being inspected by the Galileo satellite, which has spent the past five years orbiting Jupiter, returning detailed images of the planet and its moons. The sine qua non of life on Earth is liquid water. If Europa has that, plus the plethora of organic chemicals we find everywhere, then some form of life is a possibility, even if it's only microbial. </p> <p>The Europa Orbiter mission will carry a radar system capable of penetrating the ice, indicating the existence of that ocean, if it's there. But new engineering technologies are needed, and their development has already caused the launch date to slip from 2003 to 2006. </p> <p>To keep even to that delayed timetable, Nasa chiefs decided that PKE must be dropped, deferring arrival at Pluto until 2020 or so. This provoked a storm of protest. The Planetary Society, the worldwide association of space exploration enthusiasts, collected 10,000 letters of support for PKE within a fortnight. </p> <p>PKE advocates say that Nasa cannot be that hard up if it has just found $200m for an additional rover vehicle to be sent to Mars in 2003, for which there is limited scientific priority but huge public interest. They also argue that the Europa Orbiter could be launched any year, whereas PKE has to go in 2004. </p> <p>Would it be that bad if PKE were delayed a decade or so? It was a surprise when, in the 1980s, Pluto was recognised to have a tenuous atmosphere, largely composed of methane. At that time Pluto was closest to the Sun (and hence the hottest) it ever gets, having dipped within Neptune's orbit from 1979 until 1999. </p> <p>As Pluto recedes, the atmosphere is expected to freeze out. This also explains why the planet is relatively bright, for its tiny size: we think it is largely coated with methane snow, replenished each orbit, and that frosting reflects much of the sunlight reaching it. </p> <p>This provides another timetable. Soon that gaseous shroud will be no more, and PKE was designed specifically for atmospheric investigations. As one PKE advocate put it: \"The last time Pluto was where it is right now, George Washington was chopping down a cherry tree. It will be more than two hundred years before we can do what we can do today with Pluto.\" </p> <p>The time to build a PKE to reach Pluto in 2012 is right now. A few years back, when astronomers discussed if Pluto should be regarded as a fully-fledged planet, there were howls of protest from the public, and the plan to demote it was abandoned. Perhaps the imperative to visit Pluto within our lifetimes, will also put enough pressure on Nasa to put the Express back on the rails. </p> <p> Duncan Steel works at the University of Salford.

      "body": "<p>I magine living in a very small cramped room with two or three people, constantly monitored like an inmate from Big Brother for months, maybe even years, at a time. It takes a certain sort of person to live like this. They are called astronauts. </p> <p>Not only do they have to live with people for extended periods, almost without privacy, they must also cope with incredible isolation and loneliness, unable to see family and friends. Despite the glamour of space travel, in reality it is composed of tedium interspersed with crises. </p> <p>The next shuttle launch on November 30 will be a 10 day trip, practically a vacation. But within the next 10 to 20 years, Nasa plans to fly to Mars, and this could take a minimum of two to three years. </p> <p>Most of us know about the physiological problems of being in space: bone wasting, muscle loss, motion sickness and stomach aches. But psychological problems can be almost as bad. Apart from feeling bored, astronauts also experience insomnia, anxiety, depression, irritability and emotional hyper-sensitivity. </p> <p>The psychiatrist Professor Nick Kanas of the University of California in San Francisco says: \"The average person can't do it. Astronauts are living in an isolated and confined environment. It's like living in the arctic, or in a submarine, and they have to adapt. They have to tolerate seeing the same person day after day, and still deal with them on a professional basis.\" </p> <p>The sort of person who can cope in this situation doesn't feel the need to please others, or crave their own space. Kanas, who has just published a paper on how the astronauts interacted during the shuttle and Mir space missions, believes such people are born, not made, but it is possible to enhance what is already there. </p> <p>For instance, during a routine operation practised on the ground, the astronauts could be observed and afterwards told how well they dealt with the rest of the crew. If they were not open enough, or didn't listen to another member of the team, they would be asked to repeat the procedure, correcting their social faux pas.

      "bodyText": "I magine living in a very small cramped room with two or three people, constantly monitored like an inmate from Big Brother for months, maybe even years, at a time. It takes a certain sort of person to live like this. They are called astronauts. Not only do they have to live with people for extended periods, almost without privacy, they must also cope with incredible isolation and loneliness, unable to see family and friends. Despite the glamour of space travel, in reality it is composed of tedium interspersed with crises. The next shuttle launch on November 30 will be a 10 day trip, practically a vacation. But within the next 10 to 20 years, Nasa plans to fly to Mars, and this could take a minimum of two to three years. Most of us know about the physiological problems of being in space: bone wasting, muscle loss, motion sickness and stomach aches. But psychological problems can be almost as bad. Apart from feeling bored, astronauts also experience insomnia, anxiety, depression, irritability and emotional hyper-sensitivity. The psychiatrist Professor Nick Kanas of the University of California in San Francisco says: \"The average person can't do it. Astronauts are living in an isolated and confined environment. It's like living in the arctic, or in a submarine, and they have to adapt. They have to tolerate seeing the same person day after day, and still deal with them on a professional basis.\" The sort of person who can cope in this situation doesn't feel the need to please others, or crave their own space. Kanas, who has just published a paper on how the astronauts interacted during the shuttle and Mir space missions, believes such people are born, not made, but it is possible to enhance what is already there. For instance, during a routine operation practised on the ground, the astronauts could be observed and afterwards told how well they dealt with the rest of the crew. If they were not open enough, or didn't listen to another member of the team, they would be asked to repeat the procedure, correcting their social faux pas. Most people would have difficulties with this kind of personal criticism, but Kanas believes astronauts would cope if they're told they are healthy people training for an unusual situation. In his research, Kanas found the Americans seemed to have more emotional problems than the Rus sians. He thinks this was because two of the three crew were Russians, and the controls were in their hands, so the Americans may have felt they had less authority. The Russians, in contrast, had financial problems. Their salary wasn't paid for months at a time. They also suffered asthemia, a kind of agitated depression, where they became irritable, couldn't sleep and started to withdraw from their colleagues. Kanas believes this is a normal response to a confined environment. In general there was very little in-fighting between the crew, be they Americans or Russians. What tended to happen was that mission control was blamed instead. Kanas calls this displacement. \"It's as if you or I had a bad day at work. We can't tell our boss he's a jerk, so we go home and kick the cat.\" The astronauts have to deal with very stressful situations: if anything goes wrong with the shuttle, they have to repair it.

      "bodyText": "Directors of Britain's only private regulatory body, Entrust, responsible for the probity of \u00a3350m of environment grants, have quietly changed their constitution so they dispose of \u00a32m as they see fit if Entrust is closed by the government, parliament was told yesterday. The scandal came to light when the Commons environment committee yesterday summoned a senior environmentalist to give evidence on a paper by him that seriously criticised Entrust, set up by John Gummer when Tory environment secretary. Malcolm Aicken, who chairs the publicly funded environment council, wrote the paper, then decided to withhold it from the committee's inquiry into the government's waste strategy. A copy was passed to the committee chairman, Andrew Bennett, Labour MP for Denton and Reddish, by the Guardian. Yesterday he made it an official inquiry document, giving its contents parliamentary privilege. The paper damns the running of Entrust, which monitors \u00a3350m given to environmental groups under the landfill tax by waste companies. It is already under fire for being dominated by the industry, which can avoid 20% of \u00a31bn a year tax by donating to the environment. In his paper Mr Aicken criticises the directors for changing their constitution in secret so they can divert \u00a32m of Entrust's levies to any institution they choose, creating a potential abuse of power. The change was made after the national audit office began inquiries into Entrust following an investigation by the Guardian this year. Ministers are also considering whether Entrust should continue. Mr Aicken's paper said: \"We do not believe that the potential temptation to divert such sums of money, levied from environmental bodies, should be placed in the hands of even the most upright, honourable and public spirited. We consider that the potential for abuse should be avoided.\" It also revealed that regulations to pay out the \u00a3350m were \"inadequate and inconsistent to the point of incompetence\", involving environmental bodies in long winded applications and enormous audit scrutiny, while Entrust itself used light touch company legislation to avoid detailed auditing. It described the monitoring of environmental bodies as \"needlessly duplicating work\" and \"wasteful of time and resources\". The report also said Entrust had no independent appeal for registering some 2,200 trusts - which have to be approved by Entrust before they can solicit cash from waste companies. Contrary to human rights legislation, they can only appeal to the chief executive, Richard Sills, who turned them down in the first place.

In brutal exchanges at question time he effectively squashed the Tory leader, William Hague.</p> <p>Senior defence officials have backed the scheme. But even they privately admit that a crucial problem remains to be resolved: how exactly the EU forces will cooperate with Nato, especially when it wants to use Nato military assets, perhaps for a peacekeeping operation in the Balkans or further afield in Africa.</p> <p>But it was the bust-up with Lady Thatcher that echoed around Westminster last night - coincidentally or not on the 10th anniversary of her enforced resignation.</p> <p>Objection to the RRF - described by John Major as \"blundering into a misconceived political proposal\" - was linked by Lady Thatcher to her passion for the US over Europe.</p> <p>Savaging the plans, she explained: \"I prefer Nato and I prefer the great alliance between Britain, Europe and America... it is that which was of great benefit to the world. We lost a lot of people on the continent defending the liberty of our country and the countries of others and we must never forget.\"</p> <p>Just as he sounded off against \"fundamentally dishonest\" reporting of the RRF during a visit to Moscow on Monday, yesterday Mr Blair used another press conference to hit back at Lady Thatcher - with interest.</p> <p>Relations between the pair, mutually flattering during 1996-97, have gradually cooled to the point where Labour's refusal to release the ailing Chilean General Augusto Pinochet from his house arrest - pending full judicial review - enraged the former prime minister.</p> <p>Mr Hague's intervention in a crowded Commons also produced blistering exchanges. The Tory leader's taunts about the creation of a 100,000 strong \"European army\" and a \"European superstate\" produced a withering description of Mr Hague's \"six word\" policy. This amounted to \"Lady Thatcher - you lead, I'll follow,\" said Mr Blair, who claimed that the opposition so constantly falls back on the European issue because it has lost on the economy, public investment and the fight against poverty.</p> <p>Mr Hague said France wanted to create a parallel EU defence structure to Nato. Mr Blair insisted he had thwarted that goal.</p> <p>The defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, was also taunted by his Tory shadow, Iain Duncan-Smith, but seized on two of his strongest cards - that the RRF had been enthusiastically welcomed by the US and it had reversed declining defence spending in Europe, which will rise in 11 of Europe's 16 Nato states next year.</p> <p>\"Not a single senior figure in the US administration is opposed to these proposals,\" Mr Hoon told MPs.</p> <p>The US secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, had described the move as \"a strongly positive development we wholly support,\" he said.</p> <p>Senior defence officials called this week's agreement in Brussels \"good news for Nato, good news for the European Union and good news for the United States\".</p> <p>By increasing the military capacity of both the EU and Nato and offering non-military options - such as civilian police - that Nato lacks, \"it is another golf club in the bag for dealing with crises\" one official said.</p> <p>In fact, it will take years before the Europeans will be in a position to catch up with the US, even on such basic tasks as troop carrying.</p>",

In a calculated repudiation of \"boom and bust\" economics, social disharmony and under-investment in public services, Mr Blair gave his second signal in as many days that he is gearing up to confront Eurosceptic politicians and their media allies as the expected May 3 election day approaches. After six years in which Mr Blair has courted the ousted Tory leader and tried to copy her forceful presidential style, he said: \"I take nothing away from those things that were done in the 1980s that we have kept, but it really is time in my view that we move British politics beyond the time of Margaret Thatcher. \"We are in a new era. Today we have to deal with those problems that we inherited from that time - the boom and bust economics, the social division, the chronic under-investment in our public services. \"A sensible, modern attitude to Europe is what we need,\" he added. Lady Thatcher triggered yesterday's confrontation by joining a chorus of criticism of Mr Blair's commitment of 12,500 British troops to the new European rapid reaction force (RRF). \"It is a piece of monumental folly that puts our security at risk in order to satisfy political vanity,\" she warned. The prime minister was already furious with Eurosceptic \"lies\" about the role of the RRF and its implications for Nato and the \"special relationship\" with Washington. In brutal exchanges at question time he effectively squashed the Tory leader, William Hague. Senior defence officials have backed the scheme. But even they privately admit that a crucial problem remains to be resolved: how exactly the EU forces will cooperate with Nato, especially when it wants to use Nato military assets, perhaps for a peacekeeping operation in the Balkans or further afield in Africa. But it was the bust-up with Lady Thatcher that echoed around Westminster last night - coincidentally or not on the 10th anniversary of her enforced resignation. Objection to the RRF - described by John Major as \"blundering into a misconceived political proposal\" - was linked by Lady Thatcher to her passion for the US over Europe. Savaging the plans, she explained: \"I prefer Nato and I prefer the great alliance between Britain, Europe and America... it is that which was of great benefit to the world. We lost a lot of people on the continent defending the liberty of our country and the countries of others and we must never forget.\" Just as he sounded off against \"fundamentally dishonest\" reporting of the RRF during a visit to Moscow on Monday, yesterday Mr Blair used another press conference to hit back at Lady Thatcher - with interest. Relations between the pair, mutually flattering during 1996-97, have gradually cooled to the point where Labour's refusal to release the ailing Chilean General Augusto Pinochet from his house arrest - pending full judicial review - enraged the former prime minister. Mr Hague's intervention in a crowded Commons also produced blistering exchanges. The Tory leader's taunts about the creation of a 100,000 strong \"European army\" and a \"European superstate\" produced a withering description of Mr Hague's \"six word\" policy. This amounted to \"Lady Thatcher - you lead, I'll follow,\" said Mr Blair, who claimed that the opposition so constantly falls back on the European issue because it has lost on the economy, public investment and the fight against poverty. Mr Hague said France wanted to create a parallel EU defence structure to Nato. Mr Blair insisted he had thwarted that goal. The defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, was also taunted by his Tory shadow, Iain Duncan-Smith, but seized on two of his strongest cards - that the RRF had been enthusiastically welcomed by the US and it had reversed declining defence spending in Europe, which will rise in 11 of Europe's 16 Nato states next year. \"Not a single senior figure in the US administration is opposed to these proposals,\" Mr Hoon told MPs. The US secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, had described the move as \"a strongly positive development we wholly support,\" he said. Senior defence officials called this week's agreement in Brussels \"good news for Nato, good news for the European Union and good news for the United States\". By increasing the military capacity of both the EU and Nato and offering non-military options - such as civilian police - that Nato lacks, \"it is another golf club in the bag for dealing with crises\" one official said. In fact, it will take years before the Europeans will be in a position to catch up with the US, even on such basic tasks as troop carrying.",

      "body": "<p>So you've filled out the forms and waited patiently but what will you be able to play when you pick up your PlayStation 2 tomorrow? </p> <p>Well, with 16 releases planned, you should not have too much trouble finding something that appeals, although it's worth bearing in mind that the first games on any new console are rarely perfect but usually simply graphically prettier renditions of older titles. </p> <p>Perhaps the most interesting title is Timesplitters. Produced by members of the team that made the splendid Goldeneye for N64, the game is a Quake-style first person shooter (FPS). But unlike the Bond classic, Timesplitters dispenses with story and character development and instead concentrates on action, reflexes and some very pretty visuals. </p> <p>Multiplayer is the biggest attraction, with split-screen carnage a mere multi-tap purchase away (the PS2 comes with only two 2 controller ports as standard). </p> <p>Elsewhere, Konami's Gradius 3&amp; 4 and Silent Scope are different takes on the shooting genre. While the former is a playable, if old-fashioned, blaster, Silent Scope is graphically impressive sniper sim that allows you pick off the baddies from afar. </p> <p>The increasingly maverick Nintendo aside, it seems every games console launch must be accompanied by the roar of numerous racing games. PS2 is no different with at least four due out tomorrow. </p> <p>Ridge Racer V is the best known release and while it is the same powersliding arcade game as before, it has spruced-up track and car visuals. Unfortunately, the two-player game is a mess, with horrendous graphical fogging marring what is, at least on your own, a fairly decent drive. </p> <p>If you like your automobiles a little different then you could sample the offroad buggy thrills of Smuggler's Run or drive the varied terrain of Wild Wild Racing. Midnight Club lets you drive around London and New York but is streets away from the similarly styled Metropolis Street Racer on Dreamcast. </p> <p>The fighting game, is well represented on PS2 launch day. Tekken Tag Tournament, the latest in the long running series, may be the best known. While little more than a pretty update, its looks at least set it apart from its dull rival, Streetfighter EX3. </p> <p>If you are looking for a different type of combat then the comedy pugilism of Ready 2 Rumble Boxing may appeal. Dynasty Warriors was a big hit in Japan but while it impresses visually, with plenty of onscreen enemies, longevity is a problem. </p> <p>For those who like a bit of plot with their combat then the Orphen is worth a look. It's no Final Fantasy but if you're seeking a Role Playing Game then this is the only launch day choice. </p> <p>Sports fans are well catered for with a varied mix of silicon team games to enjoy. Football fans are in luck with two soccer games available from the off - FIFA 2001 and ISS. The latter is the purist's choice although smarter graphics can't hide the fact that this PS2 version lacks the subtlety and realism of Pro Evolution on the original PlayStation. </p> <p>FIFA 2001 is the latest in EA's polished series and offers a decent kickabout, helped considerably by an increased skill level; scoring is now satisfyingly difficult. EA are also releasing the well-received ice-hockey game, NHL 2001, and Snowboard Supercross (SSX) - a topically wintry sporting challenge that has as much to do with style as it does with speed. </p> <p>If you are looking for something a little more original than sport, driving and fighting then the last batch of titles may be of interest. The visually appealing Rayman Revolution is the only platform game available but if you fancy something a little more cerebral then Fantavision and Aqua Aqua: Wetrix 2 are worth a look. Fantavsion is a psychedelic Japanese oddity that lets you control a fireworks display while attempting to match up colours. No less unusual is Aqua Aqua - a water-based 3D version of Tetris that sees you building up enclosed areas to stop the liquid leaking. </p> <p>Overall it's a typical launch-day mixed bag with good variety but no truly outstanding titles. However if you have managed to get hold of a PS2 then Time Splitters, FIFA 2001, Fantavision and Silent Scope are unlikely to disappoint. </p>",

      "bodyText": "So you've filled out the forms and waited patiently but what will you be able to play when you pick up your PlayStation 2 tomorrow? Well, with 16 releases planned, you should not have too much trouble finding something that appeals, although it's worth bearing in mind that the first games on any new console are rarely perfect but usually simply graphically prettier renditions of older titles. Perhaps the most interesting title is Timesplitters. Produced by members of the team that made the splendid Goldeneye for N64, the game is a Quake-style first person shooter (FPS). But unlike the Bond classic, Timesplitters dispenses with story and character development and instead concentrates on action, reflexes and some very pretty visuals. Multiplayer is the biggest attraction, with split-screen carnage a mere multi-tap purchase away (the PS2 comes with only two 2 controller ports as standard). Elsewhere, Konami's Gradius 3&amp; 4 and Silent Scope are different takes on the shooting genre. While the former is a playable, if old-fashioned, blaster, Silent Scope is graphically impressive sniper sim that allows you pick off the baddies from afar. The increasingly maverick Nintendo aside, it seems every games console launch must be accompanied by the roar of numerous racing games. PS2 is no different with at least four due out tomorrow. Ridge Racer V is the best known release and while it is the same powersliding arcade game as before, it has spruced-up track and car visuals. Unfortunately, the two-player game is a mess, with horrendous graphical fogging marring what is, at least on your own, a fairly decent drive. If you like your automobiles a little different then you could sample the offroad buggy thrills of Smuggler's Run or drive the varied terrain of Wild Wild Racing. Midnight Club lets you drive around London and New York but is streets away from the similarly styled Metropolis Street Racer on Dreamcast. The fighting game, is well represented on PS2 launch day. Tekken Tag Tournament, the latest in the long running series, may be the best known. While little more than a pretty update, its looks at least set it apart from its dull rival, Streetfighter EX3. If you are looking for a different type of combat then the comedy pugilism of Ready 2 Rumble Boxing may appeal. Dynasty Warriors was a big hit in Japan but while it impresses visually, with plenty of onscreen enemies, longevity is a problem. For those who like a bit of plot with their combat then the Orphen is worth a look. It's no Final Fantasy but if you're seeking a Role Playing Game then this is the only launch day choice. Sports fans are well catered for with a varied mix of silicon team games to enjoy. Football fans are in luck with two soccer games available from the off - FIFA 2001 and ISS. The latter is the purist's choice although smarter graphics can't hide the fact that this PS2 version lacks the subtlety and realism of Pro Evolution on the original PlayStation. FIFA 2001 is the latest in EA's polished series and offers a decent kickabout, helped considerably by an increased skill level; scoring is now satisfyingly difficult. EA are also releasing the well-received ice-hockey game, NHL 2001, and Snowboard Supercross (SSX) - a topically wintry sporting challenge that has as much to do with style as it does with speed. If you are looking for something a little more original than sport, driving and fighting then the last batch of titles may be of interest. The visually appealing Rayman Revolution is the only platform game available but if you fancy something a little more cerebral then Fantavision and Aqua Aqua: Wetrix 2 are worth a look. Fantavsion is a psychedelic Japanese oddity that lets you control a fireworks display while attempting to match up colours. No less unusual is Aqua Aqua - a water-based 3D version of Tetris that sees you building up enclosed areas to stop the liquid leaking. Overall it's a typical launch-day mixed bag with good variety but no truly outstanding titles. However if you have managed to get hold of a PS2 then Time Splitters, FIFA 2001, Fantavision and Silent Scope are unlikely to disappoint.",

The unit allows users to make temporary video recordings on to its 30 gigabyte hard disk and then, if they find something they want to archive, transfer the footage to a DVD-RAM disc. There's also a Just mode, where image quality is determined by the amount of space left on the DVD-RAM disc. Other facilities include pausing and instantly replaying live TV, the option of creating on-screen thumbnail images for each programme recorded and playback of pre-recorded DVDs and CDs. The price for the unit is expected to be 270,000 yen (\u00a31,750). Toshiba currently has no plans to sell the RD-2000 in the UK. A unit that combines a hard disk drive with a S-VHS recorder from JVC went on sale in Japan last week.",

Then drag and drop the files you want on or off the player. </p> <p>Then you're up and away with about 10 hours' life on the HipZip's rechargeable battery. It's easy to operate, has good-quality sound and comes in a neat case with a belt clip. Each disk holds 40MB - about 40 minutes at high quality. </p> <p>The demo of the HipZip came with two disks, each with a selection of prerecorded tunes that you can delete or pop on to your hard drive for later use. </p> <p>Iomega says it is going to include four disks in future. Extra disks cost between \u00a38 and \u00a310 each - cheap compared with memory sticks but expensive compared with minidiscs, which can be bought for between \u00a31 and \u00a32 and will hold 74 minutes of music. </p> <p>However, minidiscs work on Sony's Atrac 3 format and will not accept MP3 files unless you play them as audio tracks from your computer through the earphone socket - which is slower than downloading MP3 files and can reduce sound quality. </p> <p>Sharp is tackling the problem with its Voquette adaptor, a \u00a349 device that allows you to store MP3 files on a minidisc (but it appears that this is compatible only with Sharp minidisc players). </p> <p>The HipZip does have one advantage in that it will also act as a convenient portable external file store.

      "body": "<p>There's a simple way to measure your \"computer intelligence\": divide the number of folders or directories on your personal computer by the number of files and multiply the result by 1,000. If you have, on average, a hundred files in each folder, your CIQ will be 100, which is enough to function properly. If you have up to 500 files in each folder then it is time to re-organise your hard drive. </p> <p>Hard drive organisation is important, not just so that you can find things easily, and back them up, but to keep Windows running smoothly. Windows keeps a \"swap file\" on the hard drive where it stores things when it runs out of real memory. When it starts to run out of this \"virtual memory\" (swap space), Windows' performance declines dramatically. </p> <p>Organising a hard drive is like planning a library: you want to have the right number of shelves for different types of book, and you want to be able to find individual books quickly. It makes sense to reserve different folders - or different drives, or different drive partitions - for the operating system, your applications, and your data. You may also want separate sections for any particularly large collections of data, such as MP3 files. </p> <p>You can then subdivide these main areas by creating folders for different applications and different types of data. </p> <p>Microsoft has tried to encourage this approach in recent versions of Windows. The system files are stored in the Windows directory, and applications programs in a folder called Program Files. There's also a folder called My Documents where you can store your data (files created with word processors, spreadsheets, paint programs and other applications). This may also include subdirectories such as My Library, My Music, My Pictures, and My Webs. </p> <p>Highlight the My Documents folder in Windows Explorer, then select File|New|Folder to create as many subdirectories as you like, such as My Downloads and so on. And if you don't like Microsoft's approach to directory names, you can do the same thing independently somewhere else, such as D:\\Data. </p> <p>Keeping all your personal data together makes it much easier to take back ups (security copies) in case of a hard drive failure. The operating system and applications can be re-installed from original copies, but if your data is lost, it has gone for good. </p> <p>Unfortunately, not many of Microsoft's applications programmers, and very few outsiders, have got the message. Outlook and Outlook Express, for example, do not store your vital mail files in My Mail. They hide them away where you can't see them in files with extensions such as .dbx, .mbx and .pst.

      "bodyText": "There's a simple way to measure your \"computer intelligence\": divide the number of folders or directories on your personal computer by the number of files and multiply the result by 1,000. If you have, on average, a hundred files in each folder, your CIQ will be 100, which is enough to function properly. If you have up to 500 files in each folder then it is time to re-organise your hard drive. Hard drive organisation is important, not just so that you can find things easily, and back them up, but to keep Windows running smoothly. Windows keeps a \"swap file\" on the hard drive where it stores things when it runs out of real memory. When it starts to run out of this \"virtual memory\" (swap space), Windows' performance declines dramatically. Organising a hard drive is like planning a library: you want to have the right number of shelves for different types of book, and you want to be able to find individual books quickly. It makes sense to reserve different folders - or different drives, or different drive partitions - for the operating system, your applications, and your data. You may also want separate sections for any particularly large collections of data, such as MP3 files. You can then subdivide these main areas by creating folders for different applications and different types of data. Microsoft has tried to encourage this approach in recent versions of Windows. The system files are stored in the Windows directory, and applications programs in a folder called Program Files. There's also a folder called My Documents where you can store your data (files created with word processors, spreadsheets, paint programs and other applications). This may also include subdirectories such as My Library, My Music, My Pictures, and My Webs. Highlight the My Documents folder in Windows Explorer, then select File|New|Folder to create as many subdirectories as you like, such as My Downloads and so on. And if you don't like Microsoft's approach to directory names, you can do the same thing independently somewhere else, such as D:\\Data. Keeping all your personal data together makes it much easier to take back ups (security copies) in case of a hard drive failure. The operating system and applications can be re-installed from original copies, but if your data is lost, it has gone for good. Unfortunately, not many of Microsoft's applications programmers, and very few outsiders, have got the message. Outlook and Outlook Express, for example, do not store your vital mail files in My Mail. They hide them away where you can't see them in files with extensions such as .dbx, .mbx and .pst. My OE5 mail, for example, is stored in C:\\WINDOWS\\ Application Data\\Identities\\ {C333B700-C32C-11D3-8602-B49B824D1277}\\ Microsoft\\OutlookExpress\\Inbox. dbx , and how rational is that?

      "body": "<p>Hollywood seldom attempts any but the most droolingly sentimental of stories about old people, who are either possessed of the wisdom of ages or showing clear signs of senility. What they never do is have sex. And especially not in full view on the screen.</p> <p>Paul Cox, an Australian director, has just made a film, appropriately called Innocence, that dares to fly in the face of this cinematic convention that says no sex, please, we're pensioners. He suggests not that life begins at 40 but that sometimes it starts again at 70-plus. And in bed at that.</p> <p>Innocence is a full-blown if bittersweet romance in which a reasonably happy old couple have their life totally upended when the equally aged former lover of the wife comes to visit and stays for sex.</p> <p>Having started the affair all over again, the lovers decide to do what they now realise they should have done 50 years ago. The wife asks for a divorce, not because she hates her husband - she's actually quite fond of him - but because she wants to marry the man she has fallen in love with.</p> <p>She, of course, is taking the kind of risk women, bent on reinventing themselves even if generally at a younger age, are said to handle better than men. But it is the man in this film who makes the running. He is retired, has lost his wife and suddenly sees a chance to change his life for the better by simply doing what he should have done years ago, and thereby starting a new one.</p> <p>He thus does not fall into the dark side of the \"grey panthers\" category conjured up by researchers describing the increasing number of middle-aged or elderly men living alone and falling into depression and alcoholism. He is that rare bird, the man who dares and wins.</p> <p>Is this just a charmingly made fairy tale, a kind of Australian answer to Brief Encounter with a bolder view of sex and a more audacious ending? Or does it tell us an often disguised truth: that men are as good as women at taking their lives by the scruff of the neck in middle or even old age?</p> <p>Perhaps it is neither but merely a plea to us wrinklies to follow our hearts, regardless of the consequences. Cox, a film-maker who goes against most trends and has often set about trying to redefine male-female relationships, says he is telling it like it should be, but only sometimes is.</p> <p>\"Men,\" he says, \"are just as likely as women to fight against the dying of the light. More so, in fact, because they often have the greater financial means to help them do it. The only trouble is that they have more illusions about themselves as well as more money, so get into terrible difficulties. They search for the impossible: young women, a life like they wanted to live when young but didn't, the elixir of youth and all that. When they don't find it, they relapse into not trying at all.</p> <p>\"In my film, the old man who visits his former lover becomes totally convinced he can still win her. Nine times out of 10, he probably couldn't. It would be a painful illusion on his part. He knows this but he doesn't give up and, though she is the one who doubts, in the end he convinces her. She doesn't just have to trundle along in an averagely boring marriage until the end of her days.</p> <p>\"The other man in the triangle, on the other hand, is more typical. He simply can't understand what's happened. It seems inconceivable to him that she'd give up everything on an absurd romantic whim. But then that's the other side of the coin. Some men remain blissfully unaware of what's happening to their relationships till the end of their lives. I doubt if as many women do. Yes, they are much more capable of managing their emotional lives.\"</p> <p>Viewing the film, one doubts whether too many men would take such a risk. Or that many women either. But if you made the lovers 50 instead of 70, it seems likely that more women than men now have the courage to break loose. We are told one man in 10 over 60 lives alone and that by 2020 it could well be one in three - a fair number doubtless in a state of quiet desperation, beset by financial difficulties and social and emotional problems.</p> <p>But the line between desperation and fulfilment is often difficult to gauge. The truth, Oscar Wilde said, is rarely pure and never simple. A friend of mine, for instance, has reached his mid-60s minus his wife after a divorce, retired as a teacher and with a pension that is only adequate. He'd like a new life, and especially a new relationship, but, as he admits, he hasn't the courage to go out and find one.</p> <p>\"I'm not miserable,\" he says. \"I've got nice children, good friends and I love my tennis and golf. I'm not exactly bored. But there are times when I think it's all a bit meaningless unless I can find someone to share it with.\"</p> <p>Another friend of the same age, who was retired early by his firm, bitterly regrets being unable to work, even though he is happily married and has enough money for most of the things he wants to do. \"I have a good life compared with most people, who would probably kill to be in my position. But I feel completely useless because I want to contribute something and I can't.\"</p> <p>I've heard variants of these stories several dozen times. For every man in late middle age who works himself to death, there's another who is dying to work. For every veteran male who is tied to a long-lasting but unsatisfactory relationship, there is another who searches for a liaison of any sort. It is almost certainly women rather than men who can get themselves out from under such constraints in what to them is now laughingly called the evening of their lives.</p> <p>On the other hand, I went to a village market in Kent recently. There, the mostly elderly men and women stallholders and their costumers seemed to have reversed roles with surprisingly satisfactory results. The women, many of them widows and relieved of the responsibilities of caring for husbands and children, were happily discussing busy lives they could never have contemplated before, lives unconnected with the usual family chores.</p> <p>And the men? They were swapping recipes and gardening hints like, well, a lot of old women. It seemed as if male and female lifestyle roles had been conveniently reversed. Just possibly, that might be the answer to the problem of growing older gracefully.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Hollywood seldom attempts any but the most droolingly sentimental of stories about old people, who are either possessed of the wisdom of ages or showing clear signs of senility. What they never do is have sex. And especially not in full view on the screen. Paul Cox, an Australian director, has just made a film, appropriately called Innocence, that dares to fly in the face of this cinematic convention that says no sex, please, we're pensioners. He suggests not that life begins at 40 but that sometimes it starts again at 70-plus. And in bed at that. Innocence is a full-blown if bittersweet romance in which a reasonably happy old couple have their life totally upended when the equally aged former lover of the wife comes to visit and stays for sex. Having started the affair all over again, the lovers decide to do what they now realise they should have done 50 years ago. The wife asks for a divorce, not because she hates her husband - she's actually quite fond of him - but because she wants to marry the man she has fallen in love with. She, of course, is taking the kind of risk women, bent on reinventing themselves even if generally at a younger age, are said to handle better than men. But it is the man in this film who makes the running. He is retired, has lost his wife and suddenly sees a chance to change his life for the better by simply doing what he should have done years ago, and thereby starting a new one. He thus does not fall into the dark side of the \"grey panthers\" category conjured up by researchers describing the increasing number of middle-aged or elderly men living alone and falling into depression and alcoholism. He is that rare bird, the man who dares and wins. Is this just a charmingly made fairy tale, a kind of Australian answer to Brief Encounter with a bolder view of sex and a more audacious ending? Or does it tell us an often disguised truth: that men are as good as women at taking their lives by the scruff of the neck in middle or even old age? Perhaps it is neither but merely a plea to us wrinklies to follow our hearts, regardless of the consequences. Cox, a film-maker who goes against most trends and has often set about trying to redefine male-female relationships, says he is telling it like it should be, but only sometimes is. \"Men,\" he says, \"are just as likely as women to fight against the dying of the light. More so, in fact, because they often have the greater financial means to help them do it. The only trouble is that they have more illusions about themselves as well as more money, so get into terrible difficulties. They search for the impossible: young women, a life like they wanted to live when young but didn't, the elixir of youth and all that. When they don't find it, they relapse into not trying at all. \"In my film, the old man who visits his former lover becomes totally convinced he can still win her. Nine times out of 10, he probably couldn't. It would be a painful illusion on his part. He knows this but he doesn't give up and, though she is the one who doubts, in the end he convinces her. She doesn't just have to trundle along in an averagely boring marriage until the end of her days. \"The other man in the triangle, on the other hand, is more typical. He simply can't understand what's happened. It seems inconceivable to him that she'd give up everything on an absurd romantic whim. But then that's the other side of the coin. Some men remain blissfully unaware of what's happening to their relationships till the end of their lives. I doubt if as many women do. Yes, they are much more capable of managing their emotional lives.\" Viewing the film, one doubts whether too many men would take such a risk. Or that many women either. But if you made the lovers 50 instead of 70, it seems likely that more women than men now have the courage to break loose. We are told one man in 10 over 60 lives alone and that by 2020 it could well be one in three - a fair number doubtless in a state of quiet desperation, beset by financial difficulties and social and emotional problems. But the line between desperation and fulfilment is often difficult to gauge. The truth, Oscar Wilde said, is rarely pure and never simple. A friend of mine, for instance, has reached his mid-60s minus his wife after a divorce, retired as a teacher and with a pension that is only adequate. He'd like a new life, and especially a new relationship, but, as he admits, he hasn't the courage to go out and find one. \"I'm not miserable,\" he says. \"I've got nice children, good friends and I love my tennis and golf. I'm not exactly bored. But there are times when I think it's all a bit meaningless unless I can find someone to share it with.\" Another friend of the same age, who was retired early by his firm, bitterly regrets being unable to work, even though he is happily married and has enough money for most of the things he wants to do. \"I have a good life compared with most people, who would probably kill to be in my position. But I feel completely useless because I want to contribute something and I can't.\" I've heard variants of these stories several dozen times. For every man in late middle age who works himself to death, there's another who is dying to work. For every veteran male who is tied to a long-lasting but unsatisfactory relationship, there is another who searches for a liaison of any sort. It is almost certainly women rather than men who can get themselves out from under such constraints in what to them is now laughingly called the evening of their lives. On the other hand, I went to a village market in Kent recently. There, the mostly elderly men and women stallholders and their costumers seemed to have reversed roles with surprisingly satisfactory results. The women, many of them widows and relieved of the responsibilities of caring for husbands and children, were happily discussing busy lives they could never have contemplated before, lives unconnected with the usual family chores. And the men? They were swapping recipes and gardening hints like, well, a lot of old women. It seemed as if male and female lifestyle roles had been conveniently reversed. Just possibly, that might be the answer to the problem of growing older gracefully.",

Its wheels, which were fixed with a powerful glue, have independent suspension to help cornering, and promise to counter the effects of too much well-intentioned pampering.</p> <p>Mr McArthur warned that what he was doing should not be tried by pet keepers themselves and that it was for incapacitated animals only.</p> <p>\"We see some tortoise hatchlings which are just too well looked after when young. As a result, they get too heavy at a time when their carapace is still soft and forming. It sets too low [producing too deep a shell] and they have great difficulty moving - an awful prospect, when a tortoise can live for 100 years.\"</p> <p>The operation could help tortoises with spinal injuries, including the female operated on yesterday whose back legs were too damaged to let her struggle along. Only a small number would need this treatment, Mr McArthur stressed, and it was no substitute for correct care and feeding.</p> <p>Tortoises, in fact, are used to moving fairly fast occasionally - and particularly when on heat, as Gilbert White observed in June 1780. \"Timothy's exertions are remarkable, walking on tiptoe and stirring at five in the morning. His fancy becomes intent on sexual attachments, which transport him beyond his usual gravity and induce him to forget for a time his usual solemn deportment.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "A cure for the modern life of luxury which is crippling hundreds of pet tortoises has been found by a vet, with the help of his children's toys. The vet has stuck Lego wheels on to the shells of tortoises to get the grounded reptiles moving again, in an operation in Leeds where up to 10 similar applications could be carried out in the next year. Stuart McArthur, who specialises in tortoises, and who searched for ideas in Darwin's work, Voyage of the Beagle, and Gilbert White's diary of Timothy, the pet tortoise of Selborne, said yesterday: \"I tried a very large range of Lego wheels to get the right combination of size and balance.\" Yesterday, Mr McArthur completed his second successful operation, on a 2kg pet that had been unable to move properly. Its wheels, which were fixed with a powerful glue, have independent suspension to help cornering, and promise to counter the effects of too much well-intentioned pampering. Mr McArthur warned that what he was doing should not be tried by pet keepers themselves and that it was for incapacitated animals only. \"We see some tortoise hatchlings which are just too well looked after when young. As a result, they get too heavy at a time when their carapace is still soft and forming. It sets too low [producing too deep a shell] and they have great difficulty moving - an awful prospect, when a tortoise can live for 100 years.\" The operation could help tortoises with spinal injuries, including the female operated on yesterday whose back legs were too damaged to let her struggle along. Only a small number would need this treatment, Mr McArthur stressed, and it was no substitute for correct care and feeding. Tortoises, in fact, are used to moving fairly fast occasionally - and particularly when on heat, as Gilbert White observed in June 1780. \"Timothy's exertions are remarkable, walking on tiptoe and stirring at five in the morning. His fancy becomes intent on sexual attachments, which transport him beyond his usual gravity and induce him to forget for a time his usual solemn deportment.\"",

Yet yesterday's official documents, read closely, shoot a large hole in the case made for these private finance initiatives (PFI). From now on, the public sector is having to account for its \u00a3500bn worth of assets by showing depreciation and rates of return just like a commercial balance sheet. This move to \"resource accounting\" is hugely welcome since it will, in time, lead public bodies to make a much clearer declaration of why they need to hold assets. Yet this innovation cuts the ground from under the PFI. Once public investment is fully costed and justified, what need is there for the sleight of hand of the PFI - for which revenue payments are going to have to be made for decades to come?",

      "byline": "Jack Schofield at Comdex",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>When Bill Gates showed a tablet PC during his keynote speech at the opening of the Comdex computer trade show in Las Vegas last week, Jon-Erik Prichard was well pleased. Microsoft does not make tablet PCs, but Prichard's Californian company, Aqcess, does. </p> <p>\"We applaud [Microsoft's] effort, because it legitimises the tablet space, so we have less of an argument to convince buyers. But what Gates showed was a stripped down version of what we have today,\" said Prichard. </p> <p><strong> Pads and tablets</strong><br> The first version of Aqcess's Qbe (\"cube\") personal computer tablet was a Best of Comdex award winner last year. This year the company unveiled a smaller, lighter model, the Vivo (see <a href=\"http://www.qbenet.com\">www.qbenet.com</a>). This runs Windows Me or Windows 2000 and therefore lacks the \"digital ink\" feature that allows handwriting to be manipulated like word processed text, while retaining the annotations people typically make in paper notebooks. (They put words in boxes, or ring them, and add links or arrows.) </p> <p>Naturally, the Qbe will get \"digital ink\" when it is added to Windows. In the meantime, it has handwriting recognition, voice recognition, wireless networking, and a built-in camera. The Qbe models are not available in the UK but Prichard says the company is talking to European distributors. </p> <p>Tablet or pad-style computers have been around for more than a decade, GRiD's GridPad being a notable example. However, they have not been successful with consumers, though they have been used for industrial and commercial applications, including the police and health services. </p> <p>More recently there have been attempts to sell tablet computers as mobile \"internet appliances\" (IA). This trend started at Comdex two years ago, when National Semiconductor unveiled a reference design for the WebPad as a way of encouraging sales of its Intel-compatible Geode processor (see <a href=\"http://ia.national.com\" target=\"_new\">http://ia.national.com</a>). It was continued last year, when Gates demonstrated \"MSN companions\" during his keynote speech, using a Compaq device. </p> <p>Most of these tablets are not PC-compatible but use an operating system requiring fewer, cheaper hardware resources. Examples include Linux, Be's BeOS, and Windows CE. But the market has yet to take off. </p> <p>Honeywell launched its version of the WebPad only last month (Online, October 26), but at Comdex, NatSemi unveiled a revised version, the Geode WebPad Metro. This has been co-developed by Metricom, which runs the <a href=\"http://www.ricochet.com\">Ricochet wireless network</a>, and has a built in 128kbps Ricochet wireless modem. </p> <p>The WebPad Metro measures 19.8 x 24.3 x 2.8cm and weighs 2.5lbs. It runs Windows CE 3.0, though Be's BeIA and Linux will available next year. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.rsc.se\">Sweden's RSC</a> also showed a new variant of the NatSemi design in its second-generation RSC WebPad. This is also cordless (wireless) but can use a DECT PadCard, wireless network card (802.11b) or Bluetooth or GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) connection. </p> <p>Ezex showed a string of similar pad-like WebBooks, offering a choice of Intel StrongArm, Mips, and Transmeta Crusoe processors. All run Windows CE 3, with the option of Linux to follow. The WebBooks are targeted at the traditional markets: healthcare, hospitality (eg ordering systems), sales and manufacturing. See <a href=\"http://www.ezex.net\">www.ezex.net</a>.</p> <p> The advantage of PCTs (Personal Computer Tablets) such as the Qbe Vivo is that they offer the full power of a standalone PC running Windows Me/2000 in a mobile package. They are also easy to connect to other PCs and compatible devices. WebPads have the advantages of being simpler and cheaper. Both types of device are limited by the lack of wireless networks and the high price and slow connection speeds of cellular (mobile phone) networks. Sales seem unlikely to take off until cheap, fast mobile services become widely available. </p> <p><strong> Palmtops</strong><br> Gerry Purdy, founder of the Californian research company Mobile Insights, billed it as the Battle of the Century. The fact that Comdex took time out to debate whether Palm-compatibles were better than PocketPCs showed palmtop computers were being taken seriously. Far more significant was the fact that a dozen similar machines were on show in the halls from a wide range of Asian companies, including Acer, from Taiwan, and China's giant PC supplier, Legend. </p> <p>The three major stands - Palm, Handspring, and Microsoft's PocketPC arena - were all mobbed. Handspring's partner companies were showing a very impressive range of plug-in modules for its Springboard expansion slot (not available on Palm's systems). But when it came to new devices, Microsoft's PocketPC/Windows CE 3 was the only system to score. </p> <p>Leading the way was the <a href=\"http://www.cb.co.kr\">Cyberbank Multipalm</a> from Korea. This includes a palmtop with a built-in mobile phone and unlimited wireless internet access. The 4in colour screen provides full VGA graphics with 640x480 resolution, which is four times as good as a PocketPC and more than 10 times what you get on a Palm's 160x60 screen. Like other new CE-based devices, it also includes MP3/Windows Media Audio software. </p> <p>PC-EPhone, which will sell the Multipalm in the US, says it expects the device to be manufactured by Samsung in the first quarter of next year. </p> <p>InViso, an optical design company, also showed its remarkable eCase handheld with a small viewfinder that used advanced optics to provide a sharp, legible display that looked like a full-sized screen - particularly useful with the built-in Internet Explorer browser. The display meant giving up the touch-screen operation of most CE devices but Steve Timmerman, InViso's vice president of sales and marketing, said the built-in microphone provided \"the ideal interface: speech in, web out\". </p> <p>The InViso device could be in production by next summer (estimated price about $600). Pictures of the device are at <a href=\"http://www.inviso.com\">www.inviso.com</a>. </p> <p>Casio showed a range of PocketPCs running the palmtop version of Windows CE 3. The newest model, the E-500, should be slower than Compaq's popular iPaq, but the fast screen redraw made it feel very responsive. It was also available in a range of colours. The Japanese company also showed the E-125V, an updated version of the E-115, and two rugged industrial models: the IT-700, featuring a 10-key numeric pad, and the EG-800. </p> <p>Legend, which has been selling Tianji Windows CE-based palmtops in mainland China since July 1998, now has an even bigger range, with seven models. Two include pager facilities that enable the systems to download stock prices every 20 seconds. Legend also showed a Linux-based palmtop: a spokeswoman said the CE machines were targeted at the high end, and the Linux version at the low end of the market. </p> <p>Linux was used in the lightweight <a href=\"http://www.agenda computing.com\">Agenda VR3 palmtop</a> mentioned earlier in Online, and in Mobile Data Processing's DAT500 industrial handheld (See <a href=\"http://www.4p-online.com\">www.4p-online.com</a>). Agenda is selling systems to software developers now, and will have a finished version for consumers next year. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.penbex.com\">Penbex Data Systems</a>, from Taipei, Taiwan, is also hoping to benefit from a boom in palmtop computers, and has adapted its Penbex OS operating system for the task. Palmtops using Penbex OS include the Cadmus Billionton, and the Procomp, sold in China by TCL. </p> <p>Gerry Purdy's Comdex debate between the PocketPC and the Palm had ended with forests of hands. More than two thirds of the audience voted that the PocketPC team, led by Microsoft's Phil Holden, had won the argument, though more than half felt that Palm-compatible machines would still be the market leaders two years from now. No-one voted for Penbex OS, but with Asian languages favouring a stylus rather than a keyboard, there could soon be more palmtop users in China, Korea and Japan than there are in Europe and the US. </p> <p><strong> Transmeta </strong><br> Most people don't really care very much what kind of processor their computer uses, as long as it is fast and runs the software they want. David Ditzel's Transmeta Corporation, based in Califor nia, is trying to change that with its power-saving Crusoe chip, which was at the heart of a dozen machines shown at Comdex 2000. Sony, NEC, Hitachi, Fujitsu, Casio and Gateway were among the companies using it. </p> <p>The Crusoe's selling point is that lets manufacturers produce portable devices with much longer battery life. </p> <p>But how much longer is open to debate. Sony's C1VE ultraportable PC running Windows Me, reviewed here on November 9, managed more than three hours, compared with half that for the earlier PCG-1, though it also ran somewhat slower than notebooks with 600MHz Intel processors. </p> <p>At Comdex, Casio claimed its Cassiopeia FIVA subnotebook PC, shown in prototype form, would be able to keep going for \"between six and nine hours when equipped with a large-capacity, long-life battery\". This compares with three to six hours for the FIVA MPC-102, which is based on the National Semiconductor Geode processor, originally developed by Cyrix. </p> <p>The Crusoe-based FIVA is A5 sized, less than an inch thick, and weighs 2.1lbs. It has an 8.4in colour LCD screen, and will be launched in the first half of next year. </p> <p>Hitachi hedged its bets with a more powerful notebook PC that can be supplied either with a Transmeta Crusoe or with an Intel Pentium III with SpeedStep power-saving features. Hitachi's Mini-Notebook has a 12.1in screen and weighs 3.7lbs, and has a bay that can be used for a CD or DVD drive, a second hard drive, or an extra battery. </p> <p>Hitachi also showed a 2.6lb webpad based on a Transmeta Crusoe chip and Mobile Linux. A spokesman said it was already on sale in Japan but there were \"no plans at the moment\" for a European launch. </p> <p>However, IBM, which manufactures all Transmeta's chips under contract, was not sure David could beat the Goliath known as Intel. IBM had customers try the Crusoe in test versions of its ThinkPad 240 ultraportable PC before deciding not to support the chip at the moment. A week or so later, IBM appeared at Comdex with a ThinkPad 240 sporting a power-saving Intel Mobile Pentium that will not be launched until next year. </p> <p>Transmeta spent five years developing its chip, and claimed it had a five-year lead over Intel. If it is just a year ahead, or less, this is one battle that David could lose. </p> <p><strong> And the rest </strong><br> Olympus grabbed the attention of digital photography buffs at Comdex by showing the world's first 4 megapixel camera. The Camedia E-10 is a black, professional-looking system with a 4x 9-36mm zoom lens (equivalent to 35-40mm on a 35mm camera). </p> <p>It offers a range of exposure systems and can be used in manual and autofocusing modes. It should be available in the US next month for $1,999. </p> <p>InViso showed a headset that was much smaller and provided a much sharper image than rival systems such as the Olympus EyeTrak and Daeyang E&amp;C's Cy-visor (See <a href=\"http://www.personaldisplay.com\">www.personaldisplay.com</a>). It can be used with any operating system and any device that provides a digital RGB colour output, such as a portable DVD player. </p> <p>When it goes into production, InVisio expects the initial market will be among America's 7.5 million frequent flyers who want to use their notebook PCs or watch movies in privacy. </p> <p>Both Iomega and Photela showed devices that plug into a TV set to display images without requiring a computer. Iomega's FotoShow has the edge because it can use high-capacity 100MB and 250MB Zip disks. You can also connect the FotoShow to a personal computer and use it as a normal drive. Photela's TV Slideshow is a similar device but based on a floppy disk drive. </p> <p>And finally, for the family that has everything else, the e-alarm clock. <a href=\"http://www.simpledevices.com\">Simple Devices</a> showed the SimpleClock internet alarm clock which lets you go to sleep listening to your favourite MP3 tracks or an internet radio station, and wake up to updated information from the web and your personal information manager. The SimpleClock has a colour LCD screen, and a wireless connection to your home internet network. </p> <p>Sea Star Clock International's <a href=\"http://www.eclockusa.com\" target=\"_new\">E-clock</a> is a simpler device that links to a Windows PC and lets you download up to 50 seconds of sound for use by the alarm. If you want to wake up to the sound of, say, a cock crowing, this will do the job.</p>",

In the meantime, it has handwriting recognition, voice recognition, wireless networking, and a built-in camera. The Qbe models are not available in the UK but Prichard says the company is talking to European distributors. Tablet or pad-style computers have been around for more than a decade, GRiD's GridPad being a notable example. However, they have not been successful with consumers, though they have been used for industrial and commercial applications, including the police and health services. More recently there have been attempts to sell tablet computers as mobile \"internet appliances\" (IA). This trend started at Comdex two years ago, when National Semiconductor unveiled a reference design for the WebPad as a way of encouraging sales of its Intel-compatible Geode processor (see http://ia.national.com). It was continued last year, when Gates demonstrated \"MSN companions\" during his keynote speech, using a Compaq device. Most of these tablets are not PC-compatible but use an operating system requiring fewer, cheaper hardware resources. Examples include Linux, Be's BeOS, and Windows CE. But the market has yet to take off. Honeywell launched its version of the WebPad only last month (Online, October 26), but at Comdex, NatSemi unveiled a revised version, the Geode WebPad Metro. This has been co-developed by Metricom, which runs the Ricochet wireless network, and has a built in 128kbps Ricochet wireless modem. The WebPad Metro measures 19.8 x 24.3 x 2.8cm and weighs 2.5lbs. It runs Windows CE 3.0, though Be's BeIA and Linux will available next year. Sweden's RSC also showed a new variant of the NatSemi design in its second-generation RSC WebPad. This is also cordless (wireless) but can use a DECT PadCard, wireless network card (802.11b) or Bluetooth or GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) connection. Ezex showed a string of similar pad-like WebBooks, offering a choice of Intel StrongArm, Mips, and Transmeta Crusoe processors. All run Windows CE 3, with the option of Linux to follow. The WebBooks are targeted at the traditional markets: healthcare, hospitality (eg ordering systems), sales and manufacturing. See www.ezex.net. The advantage of PCTs (Personal Computer Tablets) such as the Qbe Vivo is that they offer the full power of a standalone PC running Windows Me/2000 in a mobile package. They are also easy to connect to other PCs and compatible devices. WebPads have the advantages of being simpler and cheaper. Both types of device are limited by the lack of wireless networks and the high price and slow connection speeds of cellular (mobile phone) networks. Sales seem unlikely to take off until cheap, fast mobile services become widely available. Palmtops Gerry Purdy, founder of the Californian research company Mobile Insights, billed it as the Battle of the Century. The fact that Comdex took time out to debate whether Palm-compatibles were better than PocketPCs showed palmtop computers were being taken seriously. Far more significant was the fact that a dozen similar machines were on show in the halls from a wide range of Asian companies, including Acer, from Taiwan, and China's giant PC supplier, Legend. The three major stands - Palm, Handspring, and Microsoft's PocketPC arena - were all mobbed. Handspring's partner companies were showing a very impressive range of plug-in modules for its Springboard expansion slot (not available on Palm's systems). But when it came to new devices, Microsoft's PocketPC/Windows CE 3 was the only system to score. Leading the way was the Cyberbank Multipalm from Korea. This includes a palmtop with a built-in mobile phone and unlimited wireless internet access. The 4in colour screen provides full VGA graphics with 640x480 resolution, which is four times as good as a PocketPC and more than 10 times what you get on a Palm's 160x60 screen. Like other new CE-based devices, it also includes MP3/Windows Media Audio software. PC-EPhone, which will sell the Multipalm in the US, says it expects the device to be manufactured by Samsung in the first quarter of next year. InViso, an optical design company, also showed its remarkable eCase handheld with a small viewfinder that used advanced optics to provide a sharp, legible display that looked like a full-sized screen - particularly useful with the built-in Internet Explorer browser. The display meant giving up the touch-screen operation of most CE devices but Steve Timmerman, InViso's vice president of sales and marketing, said the built-in microphone provided \"the ideal interface: speech in, web out\". The InViso device could be in production by next summer (estimated price about $600). Pictures of the device are at www.inviso.com. Casio showed a range of PocketPCs running the palmtop version of Windows CE 3. The newest model, the E-500, should be slower than Compaq's popular iPaq, but the fast screen redraw made it feel very responsive. It was also available in a range of colours. The Japanese company also showed the E-125V, an updated version of the E-115, and two rugged industrial models: the IT-700, featuring a 10-key numeric pad, and the EG-800. Legend, which has been selling Tianji Windows CE-based palmtops in mainland China since July 1998, now has an even bigger range, with seven models. Two include pager facilities that enable the systems to download stock prices every 20 seconds. Legend also showed a Linux-based palmtop: a spokeswoman said the CE machines were targeted at the high end, and the Linux version at the low end of the market. Linux was used in the lightweight Agenda VR3 palmtop mentioned earlier in Online, and in Mobile Data Processing's DAT500 industrial handheld (See www.4p-online.com). Agenda is selling systems to software developers now, and will have a finished version for consumers next year. Penbex Data Systems, from Taipei, Taiwan, is also hoping to benefit from a boom in palmtop computers, and has adapted its Penbex OS operating system for the task. Palmtops using Penbex OS include the Cadmus Billionton, and the Procomp, sold in China by TCL. Gerry Purdy's Comdex debate between the PocketPC and the Palm had ended with forests of hands. More than two thirds of the audience voted that the PocketPC team, led by Microsoft's Phil Holden, had won the argument, though more than half felt that Palm-compatible machines would still be the market leaders two years from now. No-one voted for Penbex OS, but with Asian languages favouring a stylus rather than a keyboard, there could soon be more palmtop users in China, Korea and Japan than there are in Europe and the US. Transmeta Most people don't really care very much what kind of processor their computer uses, as long as it is fast and runs the software they want. David Ditzel's Transmeta Corporation, based in Califor nia, is trying to change that with its power-saving Crusoe chip, which was at the heart of a dozen machines shown at Comdex 2000. Sony, NEC, Hitachi, Fujitsu, Casio and Gateway were among the companies using it. The Crusoe's selling point is that lets manufacturers produce portable devices with much longer battery life. But how much longer is open to debate. Sony's C1VE ultraportable PC running Windows Me, reviewed here on November 9, managed more than three hours, compared with half that for the earlier PCG-1, though it also ran somewhat slower than notebooks with 600MHz Intel processors. At Comdex, Casio claimed its Cassiopeia FIVA subnotebook PC, shown in prototype form, would be able to keep going for \"between six and nine hours when equipped with a large-capacity, long-life battery\". This compares with three to six hours for the FIVA MPC-102, which is based on the National Semiconductor Geode processor, originally developed by Cyrix. The Crusoe-based FIVA is A5 sized, less than an inch thick, and weighs 2.1lbs. It has an 8.4in colour LCD screen, and will be launched in the first half of next year. Hitachi hedged its bets with a more powerful notebook PC that can be supplied either with a Transmeta Crusoe or with an Intel Pentium III with SpeedStep power-saving features. Hitachi's Mini-Notebook has a 12.1in screen and weighs 3.7lbs, and has a bay that can be used for a CD or DVD drive, a second hard drive, or an extra battery. Hitachi also showed a 2.6lb webpad based on a Transmeta Crusoe chip and Mobile Linux. A spokesman said it was already on sale in Japan but there were \"no plans at the moment\" for a European launch. However, IBM, which manufactures all Transmeta's chips under contract, was not sure David could beat the Goliath known as Intel. IBM had customers try the Crusoe in test versions of its ThinkPad 240 ultraportable PC before deciding not to support the chip at the moment. A week or so later, IBM appeared at Comdex with a ThinkPad 240 sporting a power-saving Intel Mobile Pentium that will not be launched until next year. Transmeta spent five years developing its chip, and claimed it had a five-year lead over Intel. If it is just a year ahead, or less, this is one battle that David could lose. And the rest Olympus grabbed the attention of digital photography buffs at Comdex by showing the world's first 4 megapixel camera. The Camedia E-10 is a black, professional-looking system with a 4x 9-36mm zoom lens (equivalent to 35-40mm on a 35mm camera). It offers a range of exposure systems and can be used in manual and autofocusing modes. It should be available in the US next month for $1,999. InViso showed a headset that was much smaller and provided a much sharper image than rival systems such as the Olympus EyeTrak and Daeyang E&amp;C's Cy-visor (See www.personaldisplay.com). It can be used with any operating system and any device that provides a digital RGB colour output, such as a portable DVD player. When it goes into production, InVisio expects the initial market will be among America's 7.5 million frequent flyers who want to use their notebook PCs or watch movies in privacy. Both Iomega and Photela showed devices that plug into a TV set to display images without requiring a computer. Iomega's FotoShow has the edge because it can use high-capacity 100MB and 250MB Zip disks. You can also connect the FotoShow to a personal computer and use it as a normal drive. Photela's TV Slideshow is a similar device but based on a floppy disk drive. And finally, for the family that has everything else, the e-alarm clock. Simple Devices showed the SimpleClock internet alarm clock which lets you go to sleep listening to your favourite MP3 tracks or an internet radio station, and wake up to updated information from the web and your personal information manager. The SimpleClock has a colour LCD screen, and a wireless connection to your home internet network. Sea Star Clock International's E-clock is a simpler device that links to a Windows PC and lets you download up to 50 seconds of sound for use by the alarm. If you want to wake up to the sound of, say, a cock crowing, this will do the job.",

Twenty-two years later, he completed the circle by becoming the gallery's director, a man whose gimlet eye for detail won him notoriety as \"the Trotsky of the arts\". His flair for organisation revealed itself early. At his prep school, Haberdashers' Aske's in north London, Sir Nicholas was head boy. His mother, Beatrice - now Baroness Serota, Labour life peer and deputy speaker in the House of Lords - once awarded him a medal for not tidying his room. Sir Nicholas's father, Stanley, was a civil engineer. After graduating in history of art, Sir Nicholas won an MA at the Courtauld Institute under the tutelage of Anita Brookner. The 54-year-old's style of management developed during the 1970s when he progressed through a series of steadily more demanding jobs that taught him how to juggle the roles of part-critic, part-bean counter and part-seducer - all required of the director of a public gallery. His first position was as an exhibition organiser at the Arts Council, then as director of the Museum of Modern Art in Oxford and, in 1976, director of the Whitechapel art gallery, a position he held until landing the directorship of the Tate in 1988. It was in this capacity that Sir Nicholas's meticulousness found its fullest expression - and condemnation. \"He's a very single-minded person,\" said Norman Rosenthal, the exhibitions secretary of the Royal Academy who ran against Sir Nicholas for the Tate job. \"'How do I get there as correctly and as quickly as possible?' is how he thinks.\" \"Nick is always the final arbiter,\" said an insider at the gallery, \"even on what crisps we serve in the restaurants.\" His major acquisitions at the Tate included classic English works but as the man with the deciding vote on the Turner Prize jury, he has flashed a more radical streak. Nonetheless, he has been accused by Brian Sewell of being \"dangerously narrow in tastes and interests, too exclusive, too readily prepared to use the Tate Gallery as his personal instrument\", for which the art critic has labelled him \"the Trotsky of the arts\". Sir Nicholas's success at fundraising, however, identifies him as a man of considerable charms. While at the Whitechapel, he raised enough money to rebuild the entire gallery.

Though Fujii has made fine recordings with powerful partners (such as her former teacher Paul Bley and Tim Berne's ruthlessly inventive drummer, Jim Black), economics dictated her show was mainly a solo flight. But for part of her performance Fujii did bring on her trumpeter husband Natsuki Tamura, a player with formidable technical resources echoing Fujii's own. </p> <p>Appearing in the week after London's jazz festival, and having next to no local reputation, did nothing for the size of the house. But Fujii played as if she were in a packed hall, filling the room with thundering chord-runs, dissonant lava-like eruptions suggestive of Cecil Taylor and Don Pullen, spinning melodies within melodies - and then whispering into the same silent space with a hypnotic command of the most delicate sonics of the instrument. Her soft sounds dropped to the barely audible, and her fleeting caresses of the strings inside the instrument fluttered like soft winds. </p> <p>Sometimes her uptempo playing was reminiscent of early Abdullah Ibrahim in its pumping, seamless lines over a repeating heartbeat of left-hand chords, sometimes it had the staccato melodies and rigorously timed tempos of contemporary classical music. </p> <p>A Jimmy Giuffre tune caught both Giuffre's typical, quiet obliqueness and Fujii's fertility and fluidity of melodic invention. She apologised for her partnerless circumstances obliging her to play the part of soloist, bassist and drummer all at once, but she was so effortlessly on top of things that it was superfluous. </p> <p>Her duet with her husband in the later stages of the performance, veering between tumultuous intensity and laterally-conceived pieces played with double-taking silences between events, was an indication of just how independent a line some young jazz-based improvisors (the ones who feel they do not have to repolish \"classic jazz\") are pursuing today. </p> <p>Though the influence of Miles Davis and Lester Bowie were apparent in his work, Tamura unpacked a bag of growls, sidelong slurs, shimmering brass-band dignity, tumbling freebop runs and percussive sound effects that were all his own.

Lange has a feisty, resilient quality whereas one thinks of Mary as a pathetic victim of morphine and her husband's miserliness. But one of the surprises in Robin Phillips's excellent revisionist production is to show Mary to be as much emotional vampire as helpless addict. </p> <p>O'Neill's play was famously written \"in tears and blood\". Set in a gaunt New England house in 1912, it offers a thinly disguised portrait of the author's own family. James Tyrone is a penny-pinching actor who wasted his precious talent on a profit-making potboiler. His wife, Mary, became drug-dependent after the traumatic birth of her youngest son, Edmund, who is now an aspiring, consumptive poet. And Edmund's brother Jamie is a cynical wastrel visibly contemptuous of his skinflint father and hophead mother. </p> <p>One tends to see the play as a painful study of a family bound together by guilt, recrimination and resentment, and to some extent it is. But Phillips's beautifully sensitive production makes us see it from a fresh angle. He reminds us O'Neill is dealing with the two great themes of modern drama: the stranglehold of the past over the present and the battle between truth and illusion. But he also suggests the moral blame for the family's misery stems as much from the mother as the father. </p> <p>Lange, in a magnificently unsentimental performance, reminds us that Mary is a woman who constantly twists the knife in the family's wounds. You can argue that her addiction is to blame; and Lange captures astonishingly Mary's transition during the day from nervous, hankie-twisting tension to dreamy narcotic escape. But, without judging the character, Lange shows it is her endless picking at the familial scabs that is the real source of agony. </p> <p>Correspondingly, Charles Dance suggests that James Tyrone's parsimony stems from childhood poverty and his Dickensian sweatshop experience, and he brings out superbly the man's muted despair and quiet love. </p> <p>Even if Paul Rudd as the self-loathing Jamie and Paul Nicholls as the sensitive Edmund offer more familiar performances, you have the exhilarating experience of rediscovering the great American dramatic classic. You go in expecting an endurance-test; you emerge as if having seen O'Neill's play for the first time. </p> <p>\u0095 Until March 3. Box office: 020-7494 5045.</p>",

Stereophonic's vocalist Kelly Jones has already strutted on to the stage, wrapped up in the sort of fluffy parka that the Gallagher brothers made grimly fashionable many years ago. He has plodded through the first in a sequence of worthy acoustic strum-alongs, and he is now unbuttoning the coat and pulling it up over his head. </p> <p>Underneath the coat he is wearing a sleeveless black tank-top, and the place erupts with high-pitched screams. Thus Jones finally confirms that he is indeed the vital missing link between Ronan Keating and Ocean Colour Scene, a \"serious\" musician who hates the Spice Girls and sings \"proper\" songs, but whose audience is as likely to applaud the sight of his bare arms as they are his rather uninspiring music. </p> <p>Jones sings earnest ditties in a droning voice that obviously comes very easily to him. Some of his tunes are quite pretty but the arrangements - mostly acoustic guitar and piano - are ordinary. The subject matter of the songs varies greatly. Have a Nice Day is about an interesting taxi driver who once said some interesting things to Jones while driving him somewhere. Caravan Holiday is about being stuck in a caravan. It is evident that he wrote one of the songs when he was 19. </p> <p>Each song is preceded by hysterical giggling and followed by rapturous applause, the female shrieks bizarrely anchored by the bellowing of a tiny contingent of middle-aged dadrock fans, who are touchingly unembarrassed at being surrounded by screaming children and who seem to think that they are at a Paul Weller concert. </p> <p>It's a shame about Jones because when he isn't singing he comes across as a lovely, intelligent and funny bloke. But as soon as he launches into one of his gargling epics his personality disappears like a light-bulb being switched off. Perhaps he just needs more time to mature and develop, to realise that the elusive quality called soul means more than closing your eyes and getting the phlegm rattling. He might yet make it. </p> <p>Jones is quite right when he derides his critics in Mr Writer. Bitterness and cynicism have no place in the wonderful world of teen-pop. We must stoically accept that there will always be complacent heart-throbs such as Kelly Jones playing this kind of music to this kind of audience and getting this kind of reception. Good luck to him and all his future imitators. </p> <p>\u0095 Kelly Jones plays the Coal Exchange, Cardiff (029-2033 0220), tomorrow.</p>",
