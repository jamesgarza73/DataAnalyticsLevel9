Cureton made a dreadful hash of John Richardson's woeful back pass two minutes later. Reading's first goal came after 28 minutes.

Cureton smashed in a loose ball to herald a goal spree. </p> <p>Within a minute Oxford had equalised. Peter Fear's free-kick was driven back by Jarman and turned into his own net by Adi Viveash. In the 72nd minute Oxford did score a goal from the coaching manual when Richardson glanced in Fear's corner. Oxford's jubilant supporters sensed the shock of all shocks. But their team could not cling on, thanks to Alan Pardew's inspired substitution. He sent on Rougier, who obliged by driving in Hodges's corner which fell conveniently for him at the far post. </p> <p>Not content with his first goal for the club, the Trinidadian was no less clinical from Jim McIntyre's subsequent deep cross. The ball bounced tamely clear from Andy Linighan's outstretched leg and in a cloud of spray Rougier buried the wayward clearance to send Oxford away sodden and sad.</p>",

Within a minute Oxford had equalised. Peter Fear's free-kick was driven back by Jarman and turned into his own net by Adi Viveash. In the 72nd minute Oxford did score a goal from the coaching manual when Richardson glanced in Fear's corner. Oxford's jubilant supporters sensed the shock of all shocks. But their team could not cling on, thanks to Alan Pardew's inspired substitution. He sent on Rougier, who obliged by driving in Hodges's corner which fell conveniently for him at the far post. Not content with his first goal for the club, the Trinidadian was no less clinical from Jim McIntyre's subsequent deep cross. The ball bounced tamely clear from Andy Linighan's outstretched leg and in a cloud of spray Rougier buried the wayward clearance to send Oxford away sodden and sad.",

      "body": "<p>Television is bad for us. It corrodes the moral fabric of society and corrupts our children with relentless images of violence. Well, that's what the proponents of increased television regulation - politicians, social campaigners and certain elements of the media- would like us to believe. </p> <p>Yet events on one of the world's most remote inhabited islands tell a different and fascinating story, one which is less palatable to those who seek an convenient scapegoat for the ills of modern society. </p> <p>Five years ago, television arrived on St Helena, in the South Atlantic. Previously, the inhabitants of this isolated British sovereignty, to which Napoleon Bonaparte was exiled, had no access to broadcast television. Amid the excitement of its arrival, there was concern that exposure to television would have a detrimental impact on the island's children, previously shown to be among the best behaved in the world. </p> <p>This event provided researchers with a rare opportunity to examine the effects of television in a real-life setting both before and after its arrival. Previous research had mostly relied on studies in artificial laboratory conditions. Findings have been contradictory, with some studies providing conclusive evidence of links between television viewing and antisocial behaviour, others claiming beneficial effects and some denying any links at all. What all these studies had in common was that they lacked real life. The opportunity to gather pre- and post-TV-watching data using a whole population (rather than samples) of children was gratefully seized by myself and colleagues; here was a real chance toput television on trial. </p> <p>The St Helena research project began collecting data two years before television arrived, chiefly by observing children in classrooms and school playgrounds. Other information came from teachers and pupils themselves. These data showed children to be hard working and very well behaved. After television became available, most of the same measures were repeated in each of the next five years. Additionally, children's viewing was sampled and a content analysis of the programmes watched, indicating the amount of violence seen, was also undertaken. And in the post-TV phase, comparisons were made between viewers' and non-viewers' behaviour. Links were also investigated between children's behaviour and the levels of violence they saw. </p> <p>The project's latest findings, using observations of children's playground behaviour, are being presented today at the international meeting on children's film and media education in Varise, Italy. Contrary to most other research, they show - after five years of viewing - that television does not unequivocally or inevitably influence children's social behaviour in adverse ways. These results are entirely consonant with other findings from the project over the past four years. </p> <p>One feasible explanation for this finding came from a recorded group discussion with older students. They concluded it was difficult to engage in anti-social acts on the island 'because everyone watches you... everyone knows you... you've just got to behave'. Seemingly, family and community social controls were more persuasive in shaping children's behaviour than exposure to television. There is a ring of truth about this reasoning, as most parents will know. </p> <p>In a similar vein, research elsewhere has shown that high levels of social control and strong informal support networks are influential in shaping behaviour. Adults would be involved in both. However, the influence of significant adults is seldom considered when causes of anti-social behaviour are sought. While it hurts to admit that children's flawed behaviour is often shaped by us, a denial of this only masks untoward consequences of considerable changes in our lives. </p> <p>For instance, support networks are less conspicuous now than a generation ago. Families, neighbourhoods and communities have lost much of their unity and influence Many homes are now headed by single parents. Marriages have declined, divorce rates have risen and kinship links have weakened. </p> <p>Levels of care, compassion and togetherness have dwindled in many neighbourhoods and communities. Urban apathy is widespread and children often grow up away from the watchful eyes of close relatives. Increasingly, both parents are away from home during workday hours.

      "bodyText": "Television is bad for us. It corrodes the moral fabric of society and corrupts our children with relentless images of violence. Well, that's what the proponents of increased television regulation - politicians, social campaigners and certain elements of the media- would like us to believe. Yet events on one of the world's most remote inhabited islands tell a different and fascinating story, one which is less palatable to those who seek an convenient scapegoat for the ills of modern society. Five years ago, television arrived on St Helena, in the South Atlantic. Previously, the inhabitants of this isolated British sovereignty, to which Napoleon Bonaparte was exiled, had no access to broadcast television. Amid the excitement of its arrival, there was concern that exposure to television would have a detrimental impact on the island's children, previously shown to be among the best behaved in the world. This event provided researchers with a rare opportunity to examine the effects of television in a real-life setting both before and after its arrival. Previous research had mostly relied on studies in artificial laboratory conditions. Findings have been contradictory, with some studies providing conclusive evidence of links between television viewing and antisocial behaviour, others claiming beneficial effects and some denying any links at all. What all these studies had in common was that they lacked real life. The opportunity to gather pre- and post-TV-watching data using a whole population (rather than samples) of children was gratefully seized by myself and colleagues; here was a real chance toput television on trial. The St Helena research project began collecting data two years before television arrived, chiefly by observing children in classrooms and school playgrounds. Other information came from teachers and pupils themselves. These data showed children to be hard working and very well behaved. After television became available, most of the same measures were repeated in each of the next five years. Additionally, children's viewing was sampled and a content analysis of the programmes watched, indicating the amount of violence seen, was also undertaken. And in the post-TV phase, comparisons were made between viewers' and non-viewers' behaviour. Links were also investigated between children's behaviour and the levels of violence they saw. The project's latest findings, using observations of children's playground behaviour, are being presented today at the international meeting on children's film and media education in Varise, Italy. Contrary to most other research, they show - after five years of viewing - that television does not unequivocally or inevitably influence children's social behaviour in adverse ways. These results are entirely consonant with other findings from the project over the past four years. One feasible explanation for this finding came from a recorded group discussion with older students. They concluded it was difficult to engage in anti-social acts on the island 'because everyone watches you... everyone knows you... you've just got to behave'. Seemingly, family and community social controls were more persuasive in shaping children's behaviour than exposure to television. There is a ring of truth about this reasoning, as most parents will know. In a similar vein, research elsewhere has shown that high levels of social control and strong informal support networks are influential in shaping behaviour. Adults would be involved in both. However, the influence of significant adults is seldom considered when causes of anti-social behaviour are sought. While it hurts to admit that children's flawed behaviour is often shaped by us, a denial of this only masks untoward consequences of considerable changes in our lives. For instance, support networks are less conspicuous now than a generation ago. Families, neighbourhoods and communities have lost much of their unity and influence Many homes are now headed by single parents. Marriages have declined, divorce rates have risen and kinship links have weakened. Levels of care, compassion and togetherness have dwindled in many neighbourhoods and communities. Urban apathy is widespread and children often grow up away from the watchful eyes of close relatives. Increasingly, both parents are away from home during workday hours. And, all too easily, young family members may be left unsupervised in the home and neighbourhood. These changes have given many youngsters unlimited opportunities to learn anti-social traits from their unsupervised TV viewing, as well as freely practise them without fear of detection, let alone retribution. Cases of vandalism, theft, assaults and public-order offences have become commonplace in many of our towns and cities, yet reproaching television succeeds only in deflecting attention from the actual source of our concerns. Quite simply, it is often the case (within and outside homes) that there are too few adults around who are willing and able to supervise and check youngsters' (and others') behaviour satisfactorily. In St Helena, what we are witnessing is how healthy family, neighbourhood and community forces can combine effectively in shaping children's behaviour. Although young viewers can learn anti-social behaviour from television, opportunities to practise it are limited by the presence of watchful eyes. There are lessons to be learned from St Helena. Nevertheless, the dilemma facing most westernised communities is more about how to revive and then utilise these influential forces rather than about current arguments on watersheds and regulatory controls. \u0095 Professor Tony Charlton is a psycologist at the Centre for Behaviour Studies in Cheltenham, and part of the St Helena research team.",

Paul Merson has had a few during his life, which has had so many ups and downs it has resembled a snakes-and-ladders board at times, and the Aston Villa player must now be ruing the fact that he called time on his England career last year. </p> <p>The former Arsenal forward is 32 going on 21, which is why Villa manager John Gregory gave him a one-year extension to his contract earlier this week. </p> <p>Merson responded with a marvellous display of guile and graft against Charlton, chasing and caressing the ball in equal measure and scoring what proved to be the winner with a rare headed goal in the 41st minute. </p> <p>And with England crying out for inspiration from the middle, Merson is the sort of player the new coaching set-up can ill-afford to ignore. Certainly Gregory thinks he could be persuaded to change his mind should Peter Taylor and Steve McClaren think he is worth another chance. </p> <p>'If he got the call to play for England again I'm sure he'd jump at the opportunity,' said Gregory. 'Everything about him is good - his contribution to the team, his ability to score goals, his persona about the place.

      "bodyText": "Regrets? Paul Merson has had a few during his life, which has had so many ups and downs it has resembled a snakes-and-ladders board at times, and the Aston Villa player must now be ruing the fact that he called time on his England career last year. The former Arsenal forward is 32 going on 21, which is why Villa manager John Gregory gave him a one-year extension to his contract earlier this week. Merson responded with a marvellous display of guile and graft against Charlton, chasing and caressing the ball in equal measure and scoring what proved to be the winner with a rare headed goal in the 41st minute. And with England crying out for inspiration from the middle, Merson is the sort of player the new coaching set-up can ill-afford to ignore. Certainly Gregory thinks he could be persuaded to change his mind should Peter Taylor and Steve McClaren think he is worth another chance. 'If he got the call to play for England again I'm sure he'd jump at the opportunity,' said Gregory. 'Everything about him is good - his contribution to the team, his ability to score goals, his persona about the place. He inspires people and they look to him to score goals out of nothing.' Indeed, his goal yesterday showed that although he has been playing a deeper role in recent years, his striker's instincts are still razor sharp. When Alan Wright whipped in a cross from the left, the ball was heading for the arms of Dean Kiely until Merson appeared from nowhere to glance a header past the bemused goalkeeper.

Officials said the match was raided because it had gone 10 minutes beyond the 4pm deadline set by the Taliban supreme leader Mullah Mohammad Omar. </p> <p>The incident was typical of the growing problems since football was re-authorised in 1998 after years of Islamic prohibition - during which the Kandahars football stadium was turned over exclusively to public executions and limb amputation (attracting 35,000 capacity crowds). In July this year, members of a visiting Pakistani junior team were arrested at gun point during a game because they arrived wearing shorts. 'Only five players were able to escape,' said captain Abdul Qayuum. 'The rest were rounded up and had their heads shaven as a punishment.' Supporters, meanwhile, are forbidden to clap, and instead are obliged - again at gun point - to cheer both sides equally with chants of 'Allahu Akbar'. As a result, the game is struggling to re-establish its popularity. 'Executions and punishments here at the stadium are excellent but do not mean the Islamic Emirate is not interested in sport,' says spokesman Mullah Abdul Shukur Motmain. 'I just hope the same number of people will come to see the matches.' </p> <p><strong>Leeds row: the ref was right</strong> </p> <p>'Leeds sold down the Riva' blasted the Star last week after Rivaldo's Champions League injury time goal against Leeds: 'it was a ridiculous amount of extra time'.

Where the four extra minutes came from will remain a mystery.' Well - not quite. Observer IQ statisticans at Elland Road, using Uefa backed measures, saw straight away that the ref was right.

According to Dr Alfredo Cahe, 'this is a significant risk - although, I suppose, he cannot stay in Cuba for ever.' Maradona evidently disagrees. After admitting privately to being underwhelmed by the modest size of his new club, Almagro, he's decided to manage them from his Cuban cottage - 4,200 miles away. 'At least someone has made me an offer and I suppose that's something,' he told friends. No-one, though, seems to have warned Almagro president Dardo de Marchi. 'Having Diego here will be like touching heaven,' he said last week. 'Maradona can show the world his true self, and maybe one day a new divine Maradona will emerge.' </p> <p> <strong> Championship Manager: the winners</strong> </p> <p>Winners of last week's CM00/01 competition (1.55m copies of the series have been sold worldwide): Liam O'Donnell, Merseyside; Patrick Simkins, Surrey; Greg Gordon, Glasgow; Anton Marks, London; Samantha Warrington, London; Gill James, Rugby; David Reynolds, Walsall; Patrick Doggett, Dublin; Ben Foote, Guernsey; Philipp Lohan, Montreal, Canada. </p> <p><strong>Tales from the Tabs</strong> </p> <p><strong> STUFF YOU COLLY</strong> </p> <p> Bradford players have told Stan Collymore to forget about a long-term stay unless he proves he's not a nutter.

Maradona: the absentee gaffer A warning from Cuban doctors that Maradona's heart problem could recur after he accepted a return to football management should relax: despite 'looking forward immensely to the job' in Argentina, Maradona won't actually be leaving the country. According to Dr Alfredo Cahe, 'this is a significant risk - although, I suppose, he cannot stay in Cuba for ever.' Maradona evidently disagrees. After admitting privately to being underwhelmed by the modest size of his new club, Almagro, he's decided to manage them from his Cuban cottage - 4,200 miles away. 'At least someone has made me an offer and I suppose that's something,' he told friends. No-one, though, seems to have warned Almagro president Dardo de Marchi. 'Having Diego here will be like touching heaven,' he said last week. 'Maradona can show the world his true self, and maybe one day a new divine Maradona will emerge.' Championship Manager: the winners Winners of last week's CM00/01 competition (1.55m copies of the series have been sold worldwide): Liam O'Donnell, Merseyside; Patrick Simkins, Surrey; Greg Gordon, Glasgow; Anton Marks, London; Samantha Warrington, London; Gill James, Rugby; David Reynolds, Walsall; Patrick Doggett, Dublin; Ben Foote, Guernsey; Philipp Lohan, Montreal, Canada. Tales from the Tabs STUFF YOU COLLY Bradford players have told Stan Collymore to forget about a long-term stay unless he proves he's not a nutter. The squad turned on the striker when the signing was announced - but Collymore says he's up for the challenge. 'All I want is to do right by this club.' TITI BYE EVERYONE Titi Camara has stormed out of Anfield after being left on the bench during Liverpool's Uefa Cup game on Thursday. Camara - who signed for \u00a32.5m a year ago - wants a new Premiership club, but Man City have had an initial \u00a33m enquiry knocked back. \u0095 Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has repeated his fears for Arsenal once the new-look transfer system is in place: 'It will just make the footballing world even more unstable. You could meet your squad on a Thursday and by the Sunday after the game, half the players could've left.' Edu, meanwhile, is getting increasingly excited as his arrival in London nears: 'Arsenal is in my head and I can't get it out of my head.' \u0095 Aston Villa could make a massive bid for Chelsea's Tore Andre Flo after ruling out a \u00a313m deal for South African Benni McCarthy. Claudio Ranieiri will sell Flo for \u00a38m. \u0095 Bradford say they'll up Stan Collymore's reported \u00a313,000-a-week plus \u00a37,000-a-game salary if he scores regularly. \u0095 Charlton have taken former Arsenal reserve midfielder Guilliaume Norbert on trial. \u0095 Jesper Gronkjaer's agent has denied that the player has failed a Chelsea medical: 'It's rubbish. We've just had no decision yet.' \u0095 Cedric Roussel says Gordon Strachan is right to drop him from Coventry's first team: 'I agree with Gordon.' \u0095 Derby are still negotiating for Marseille defender Lilian Martin. \u0095 Everton's Abel Xavier is a target for Benfica. \u0095 Ipswich have denied agreeing to sell James Scowcroft to Leicester. \u0095 Leeds ' goalkeeping love-in goes on: Nigel Martyn says Paul Robinson is 'an England keeper in waiting' - Robinson says Martyn is 'number one as far as I'm concerned.' \u0095 Leicester won't be spending to end their goalscoring crisis: 'The goals we need are just around the corner,' says Peter Taylor. \u0095 Liverpool are ready to extend Erik Meijer's loan at Preston. \u0095 Norwich have taken Man City's Danny Granville on loan. \u0095 Manchester United target Phillippe Mexes is being chased by Juventus - the young defender, 'the new Laurent Blanc', is rated at \u00a35m by Auxerre. \u0095 Middlesbrough are still watching Barnsley's Chris Morgan. \u0095 Newcastle are keen on PSV defender Ernest Faber. \u0095 Southampton are finally ready to sell James Beattie to Crystal Palace. \u0095 Sunderland's Nicky Summerbee is set to quit - Bradford and Bolton are keen. \u0095 George Graham says Tottenham fans are misguided: 'I just wish the crowd would see our achievements'. \u0095 Crewe boss Dario Gradi has denied talking to West Ham about teen striker Dean Ashton.",

Other plum ties include the winners of the postponed match between Aldershot and Dover Athletic who will play high-flying Brighton, Harrow Borough who meet Lawrie Sanchez's Wycombe and Welling United or Dorchester Town who take on Wigan.",

After the heavy dew under the lights of Karachi, the bugs and insects of Lahore, what awaits the players when the sun has set in Rawalpindi? </p> <p>After the victory in Karachi on Tuesday, coach Duncan Fletcher spoke about the virtue of a settled batting order in one-day cricket.

This was lamentably lacking on Friday in Lahore. </p> <p>When England lost their first wicket, the score was 66 for one in the thirteenth over.

As it happened, Hick performed with an air of resignation throughout the match. With England shackled, he was run out in a fashion that would have prep school coaches tearing their hair out and his off-breaks were anaemic. </p> <p>Meanwhile Flintoff, the man the Pakistanis currently fear the most, was stranded with a hapless tail. What a waste. All the more so since Hussain had been carrying an ankle injury and there was every reason for him to drop down the order in Lahore. </p> <p>I sense a tension about Hussain's role in the one-day team, in particular where he should bat. </p> <p>Hussain, being a bright bloke, must be aware of his limitations and he seems hellbent on justifying his position by batting himself at three. Some have argued that he has to bat in the first three to warrant a place in the one-day side, a situation complicated by the fruitful alliance of Stewart and Trescothick as opening batsmen. I don't see why that should be the case. </p> <p>In the sort of circumstances that prevailed on Friday he could put himself at six, where his adhesive qualities would be valuable as a safety valve. He would be charged with recovering the situation if the destructive men had failed. There is no disgrace in this role. Combined with his superb fielding and his leadership skills, these are enough to justify his place in the team. </p> <p>After tomorrow, this will not be a significant issue though it will pop up again every time England embark on a one-day series. </p> <p>What England will encounter time and time again in Pakistan are dry, holding pitches and the mischievous spinners, Mushtaq Ahmed and Saqlain Mushtaq. The home side's spinners may have been neutered by the dew of Karachi and Moin Khan's decision to bat first but they were formidable in Lahore. In response England's only trump card was Ashley Giles, who hardly represents an ace in the pack. Nonetheless he did not bowl too badly in Lahore and he can look forward to a lot of work in the Test series. </p> <p>By Tuesday, that Test series will have the undivided attention of the England tourists, which brings me back to Flintoff. I think there is a strong argument for keeping him in Pakistan even though he is unable to bowl. This would be a very unEnglish thing to do, though Pakistan on tour have often ferried players to and fro apparently on a whim. </p> <p>The only recent precedent for England adding to their touring squad even though there has been no injured player to replace occurred in India on the 1992-93 tour. And it was a disaster. On that spectacularly unsuccessful tour a young Ian Salisbury accompanied the party from the start as a net bowler, to gain experience and to proffer some wrist spin. </p> <p>The idea was that he should stay for a fortnight before joining the 'A' tour. But he impressed within the comforting confines of the nets, was retained in the party and, remarkably, was picked ahead of John Emburey and Phil Tufnell for the first Test in Calcutta. Salisbury bowled poorly; the confidence of Tufnell, in particular, was shredded by Salisbury's continued presence in India and England disintegrated. </p> <p>But that experience should not deter England from keeping Flintoff in Pakistan. I can, I'm afraid, envisage a situation where England have to win a Test to share the series. In which case the option of Flintoff, who on his day just could intimidate the Pakistani spinners and who could score quickly enough to change the balance of a match, is worth having. Alternatively a bold England might want to launch a pre-emptive strike in the first Test. The continuing presence of Flintoff, whose technique is currently suited to non-seaming pitches, would at least give England another option: more flexibility, a quality not be scorned in Pakistan.</p>",

      "byline": "Stephanie Merritt",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p> 'Please don't be worried - she can't see you,' whispered Johnson, our safari guide, who was displaying an unseemly amusement at my naked terror. Clearly his expertise was the greater, but I wasn't convinced - 'she' being a lioness the size of a Shetland pony who was standing two feet from my right leg and looking right at me with luminescent yellow eyes and the same contemptuous glare Sheryl Potts used to give me in the playground as she decided whether or not to lamp me. </p> <p>'She can only see the truck,' Johnson elaborated. 'So just make sure you don't move suddenly,' he added - unnecessarily, I thought, since I was riveted to my seat. The rest of our party were cheerfully snapping away like paparazzi, but then they didn't have a lion (with teeth) sniffing their foot through the open side of the truck. </p> <p>Just then, as if on cue, the rest of the pride appeared out of the bush; about 12 altogether, females and cubs, and surrounded us, stalking quietly around the truck with a kind of haughty curiosity. There's an instinctive fear, of course, but also incredulity - you have to remind yourself that this is not a zoo, nor is it television, and no matter how much you may have paid for it, these animals are not here for your entertainment. This is Botswana, and you're in the middle of a grassy plain so vast and so flat you fancy you can see the curvature of the earth at the endless horizon, under a towering, empty sky, and these lions could kill you if they felt like it. Fortunately, they did n't, and they rarely do - unless, like the Japanese man Johnson told us about, you're actually stupid enough to get out of the truck so you can be in a photo with the lion. But their proximity makes you realise just how far from civilisation you really are out here. It's as well, then, that the Botswana guides are so highly trained; guns are banned in the national parks, which means that the animals are less wary of humans, having never heard the sound of gunshot. It also means that your only protection is the knowledge and responses of your guide, who can read the landscape and the mood of the animals from hundreds of yards away. </p> <p>We had arrived in Botswana after a two-hour flight from Johannesburg to Maun, the operations centre of the Okavango Delta, where most of the country's safari industry is based. Here we were met by Gametrackers' operations manager, Malcolm, who may have been the bastard child of Indiana Jones and Crocodile Dundee - a sort of Platonic ideal of a safari guide so replete with testosterone he made the bull elephants look limp-wristed. We then transferred by light aircraft to Savute Elephant Camp, the first of the three Gametrackers lodges, but not before I'd had a screaming fit on the landing strip when the pilot began complaining of temporary blackouts brought on by his drink problem. (Yes, I know anyone else would have realised it was a joke, but I'd only had an hour's sleep. The previous night we'd stayed in the five-star Westcliff Hotel in Johannesburg, the wine was unbelievable and, more importantly, free and half the England rugby team was in the swimming pool. Well, you wouldn't have gone to bed either.) </p> <p>Savute is situated in the Chobe National Park, on the fringe of the Kalahari desert and - as the name suggests - is home to large herds of bull elephants during the dry season. The camp is almost as spectacular as the fauna, comprising a central dining room, lounge and bar resembling some colonial residence from the last days of the Raj, with 12 cabins charmingly (and deceptively) called 'tents'. They are, in fact, plush, thatched, air-conditioned canvas chalets with electric sockets and hot showers, and are so comfortable you could easily believe yourself in a five-star hotel room were it not for the elephants truffling about outside. </p> <p>I was reminded of that old joke - 'How do you know when an elephant's been in your fridge?' 'There are footprints in the butter' - on the first afternoon I woke from a nap to find a very large elephant indeed snorting about on my verandah. Okay, it wasn't actually on the verandah, but its trunk was, and we watched each other from a distance of about three feet with a guarded mutual curiosity for a few minutes until it had snuffled up all the pods from the surrounding trees and decided to lumber off. The animals are free to wander in and out of the camp, which is why you are not allowed to go outside your tent without a guide after dark, but the elephants harrumph around during the day and you just have to wait politely for them to move on before attempting to get past. Steve and June, the camp managers, showed us evidence of nocturnal visits from the local hyena - chewed cushions, a half-eaten visitors' book - and told us of the times when lions and cheetahs had been found wandering the camp at night. Fortunately we had to contend with nothing more menacing than the monkeys who, well-versed in the camp's feeding timetable, would bounce around in the rafters of the dining room, poised to swoop down and nick the food from your plate if you were foolish enough to take your eyes off it. </p> <p>It was winter in southern Africa, so our morning and evening game drives were fairly cold, although during the day it was hot enough to swim and sunbathe. Late rains this year meant that we were lucky enough to see herds of zebra, who would usually have migrated from the area earlier, and clusters of giraffes, elegant and melancholic, strolling by the scrubby trees that dotted the grassland. There were jackals, baboons, multi-coloured hornbills, okapi, elephants - so plentiful that our guide would simply wave a hand nonchalantly whenever we saw one and say, 'A. B. E.' (Another Big Elephant) - and, my favourites, a family of warthogs, trotting cheerfully in single file across our path like cartoon characters. In the evenings, the air was thick with the smell of wild sage and warm earth, and the evening drive would include a stop by a waterhole, where our guide would unpack a hamper of cold beers and gin and tonics, and we watched the breathtaking neon sunset, listened to the cries of the birds and vowed never to go back to London. </p> <p>Unfortunately it's not quite that simple. Botswana is not a place for itinerant gap-year students and jobbing back-packers. The government has decided, very wisely, to place stringent limits on the development of the tourist industry, restricting the number of lodges, and encouraging luxury safari operators such as Gametrackers/Orient Express as part of a 'high cost, low numbers' policy. This has the advantage of preserving the landscape, leaving the parks and reservations as free from human activity and close to the animals' natural habitat as possible. </p> <p> The following day, our gung-ho Kiwi pilot returned in the little Cessna to take us from Savute to Eagle Island Camp in the heart of the Okavango Swamp. From the plane you can watch the landscape changing beneath you, from dry grassland to pools and rivulets fringed with trees and plants; the rains had been heavy this year, and our pilot pointed out rivers which were flowing for the first time in 30 years, though my fellow passengers seemed distracted from the view when I took over the controls for a few minutes. </p> <p>At Eagle Island, the layout of the camp was similar, but the game-viewing was all done by boat, and the biggest danger here was not lions but hippos. Despite their plump, smiley expressions, hippos, our guide informed us, are the nastiest beasts in Africa; while most animals would not attack you unless severely provoked, a hippo would happily charge a boat just to amuse itself. The motor boats could outrun a hippo, unless it came at you from the reeds, but the guides can tell from the beast's bellowing how far away it is and whether it's in a bad mood; to the untrained ear, however, the bellows sound as if it is just behind you. Our first boat trip was in a mekoro , a traditional dugout canoe punted by the guide with a long pole, which is entirely unhippo-proof. Sound is distorted easily over water, but the hippo I was convinced had been following us as we cruised the perimeter of the camp turned out to be a toilet flushing. At night, though, the hippos come out on to the bank and wander right up to the tents - happily, unlike the baboons, they haven't figured out how to undo the catch. </p> <p>Eagle Island is a bird-watcher's dream; there are fish eagles, storks, kingfishers, herons and cormorants of all colours. Perhaps the most exciting sight, though, was a baby crocodile sunning itself on the bank, immobile as a waxwork. Our guide, Tuelo, even took the boat right up to it, almost a foot from its snout, without it seeming at all troubled; but if you were to fall out of the boat, Tuelo warned, it would be on you quicker than you could blink. </p> <p>Wildlife aside, one of the most impressive aspects of the Gametrackers camps was the food. We'd start with breakfast at six, before the game viewing expedition, then there would be a stop for coffee and biscuits halfway round, when the guide would find an appropriate place to stop. One of the finest was a secluded island that Tuelo took us to through a seemingly impenetrable reed bed. Later there was lunch, followed almost immediately by tea, then the evening game viewing with its break for sundowners. The evening meal was a serious affair, where all the African staff of the camp would gather to welcome the guests with traditional songs in Setswana, and dance in the communal dining room as the insects chugged and whistled towards the lights and the hippos bellowed in the distance. </p> <p>The head chef for the three camps, Heather, had worked in five-star restaurants all over the world, including Princess Diana's old haunt Daphne's; we ate a lot of local fruits and vegetables, beef and fresh fish and even, on one occasion, impala steaks, which were exquisite but chafed at my conscience the next day when we came across some impala who stared at us accusingly with their big, chocolate eyes. </p> <p>The final camp, Kwai River Lodge, brought the elephants back; we would sit at the bar and watch them bathing in the river, the occasional lone hippo shambling by on the far bank. Our guide took us for a night drive in search of cheetahs, who cruise through the bush with extraordinary night vision; we found fresh tracks, but no cheetahs. The drive itself was such an experience, though, we hardly minded. The landscape seems limitless in the dark, the noises magnified, the scent of grasses and sage heavier. </p> <p>As we sat around the campfire on the last night, we began to question quite seriously why anyone would choose to live in London. Of course, daily life in Botswana is not quite like being at a Gametrackers Camp, which is why they don't come cheap, but if you're going to go on safari, you'll probably only do it once, so you might as well do it in style.

      "bodyText": "'Please don't be worried - she can't see you,' whispered Johnson, our safari guide, who was displaying an unseemly amusement at my naked terror. Clearly his expertise was the greater, but I wasn't convinced - 'she' being a lioness the size of a Shetland pony who was standing two feet from my right leg and looking right at me with luminescent yellow eyes and the same contemptuous glare Sheryl Potts used to give me in the playground as she decided whether or not to lamp me. 'She can only see the truck,' Johnson elaborated. 'So just make sure you don't move suddenly,' he added - unnecessarily, I thought, since I was riveted to my seat. The rest of our party were cheerfully snapping away like paparazzi, but then they didn't have a lion (with teeth) sniffing their foot through the open side of the truck. Just then, as if on cue, the rest of the pride appeared out of the bush; about 12 altogether, females and cubs, and surrounded us, stalking quietly around the truck with a kind of haughty curiosity. There's an instinctive fear, of course, but also incredulity - you have to remind yourself that this is not a zoo, nor is it television, and no matter how much you may have paid for it, these animals are not here for your entertainment. This is Botswana, and you're in the middle of a grassy plain so vast and so flat you fancy you can see the curvature of the earth at the endless horizon, under a towering, empty sky, and these lions could kill you if they felt like it. Fortunately, they did n't, and they rarely do - unless, like the Japanese man Johnson told us about, you're actually stupid enough to get out of the truck so you can be in a photo with the lion. But their proximity makes you realise just how far from civilisation you really are out here. It's as well, then, that the Botswana guides are so highly trained; guns are banned in the national parks, which means that the animals are less wary of humans, having never heard the sound of gunshot. It also means that your only protection is the knowledge and responses of your guide, who can read the landscape and the mood of the animals from hundreds of yards away. We had arrived in Botswana after a two-hour flight from Johannesburg to Maun, the operations centre of the Okavango Delta, where most of the country's safari industry is based. Here we were met by Gametrackers' operations manager, Malcolm, who may have been the bastard child of Indiana Jones and Crocodile Dundee - a sort of Platonic ideal of a safari guide so replete with testosterone he made the bull elephants look limp-wristed. We then transferred by light aircraft to Savute Elephant Camp, the first of the three Gametrackers lodges, but not before I'd had a screaming fit on the landing strip when the pilot began complaining of temporary blackouts brought on by his drink problem. (Yes, I know anyone else would have realised it was a joke, but I'd only had an hour's sleep. The previous night we'd stayed in the five-star Westcliff Hotel in Johannesburg, the wine was unbelievable and, more importantly, free and half the England rugby team was in the swimming pool. Well, you wouldn't have gone to bed either.) Savute is situated in the Chobe National Park, on the fringe of the Kalahari desert and - as the name suggests - is home to large herds of bull elephants during the dry season. The camp is almost as spectacular as the fauna, comprising a central dining room, lounge and bar resembling some colonial residence from the last days of the Raj, with 12 cabins charmingly (and deceptively) called 'tents'. They are, in fact, plush, thatched, air-conditioned canvas chalets with electric sockets and hot showers, and are so comfortable you could easily believe yourself in a five-star hotel room were it not for the elephants truffling about outside. I was reminded of that old joke - 'How do you know when an elephant's been in your fridge?' 'There are footprints in the butter' - on the first afternoon I woke from a nap to find a very large elephant indeed snorting about on my verandah. Okay, it wasn't actually on the verandah, but its trunk was, and we watched each other from a distance of about three feet with a guarded mutual curiosity for a few minutes until it had snuffled up all the pods from the surrounding trees and decided to lumber off. The animals are free to wander in and out of the camp, which is why you are not allowed to go outside your tent without a guide after dark, but the elephants harrumph around during the day and you just have to wait politely for them to move on before attempting to get past. Steve and June, the camp managers, showed us evidence of nocturnal visits from the local hyena - chewed cushions, a half-eaten visitors' book - and told us of the times when lions and cheetahs had been found wandering the camp at night. Fortunately we had to contend with nothing more menacing than the monkeys who, well-versed in the camp's feeding timetable, would bounce around in the rafters of the dining room, poised to swoop down and nick the food from your plate if you were foolish enough to take your eyes off it. It was winter in southern Africa, so our morning and evening game drives were fairly cold, although during the day it was hot enough to swim and sunbathe. Late rains this year meant that we were lucky enough to see herds of zebra, who would usually have migrated from the area earlier, and clusters of giraffes, elegant and melancholic, strolling by the scrubby trees that dotted the grassland. There were jackals, baboons, multi-coloured hornbills, okapi, elephants - so plentiful that our guide would simply wave a hand nonchalantly whenever we saw one and say, 'A. B. E.' (Another Big Elephant) - and, my favourites, a family of warthogs, trotting cheerfully in single file across our path like cartoon characters. In the evenings, the air was thick with the smell of wild sage and warm earth, and the evening drive would include a stop by a waterhole, where our guide would unpack a hamper of cold beers and gin and tonics, and we watched the breathtaking neon sunset, listened to the cries of the birds and vowed never to go back to London. Unfortunately it's not quite that simple. Botswana is not a place for itinerant gap-year students and jobbing back-packers. The government has decided, very wisely, to place stringent limits on the development of the tourist industry, restricting the number of lodges, and encouraging luxury safari operators such as Gametrackers/Orient Express as part of a 'high cost, low numbers' policy. This has the advantage of preserving the landscape, leaving the parks and reservations as free from human activity and close to the animals' natural habitat as possible. The following day, our gung-ho Kiwi pilot returned in the little Cessna to take us from Savute to Eagle Island Camp in the heart of the Okavango Swamp. From the plane you can watch the landscape changing beneath you, from dry grassland to pools and rivulets fringed with trees and plants; the rains had been heavy this year, and our pilot pointed out rivers which were flowing for the first time in 30 years, though my fellow passengers seemed distracted from the view when I took over the controls for a few minutes. At Eagle Island, the layout of the camp was similar, but the game-viewing was all done by boat, and the biggest danger here was not lions but hippos. Despite their plump, smiley expressions, hippos, our guide informed us, are the nastiest beasts in Africa; while most animals would not attack you unless severely provoked, a hippo would happily charge a boat just to amuse itself. The motor boats could outrun a hippo, unless it came at you from the reeds, but the guides can tell from the beast's bellowing how far away it is and whether it's in a bad mood; to the untrained ear, however, the bellows sound as if it is just behind you. Our first boat trip was in a mekoro , a traditional dugout canoe punted by the guide with a long pole, which is entirely unhippo-proof. Sound is distorted easily over water, but the hippo I was convinced had been following us as we cruised the perimeter of the camp turned out to be a toilet flushing. At night, though, the hippos come out on to the bank and wander right up to the tents - happily, unlike the baboons, they haven't figured out how to undo the catch. Eagle Island is a bird-watcher's dream; there are fish eagles, storks, kingfishers, herons and cormorants of all colours. Perhaps the most exciting sight, though, was a baby crocodile sunning itself on the bank, immobile as a waxwork. Our guide, Tuelo, even took the boat right up to it, almost a foot from its snout, without it seeming at all troubled; but if you were to fall out of the boat, Tuelo warned, it would be on you quicker than you could blink. Wildlife aside, one of the most impressive aspects of the Gametrackers camps was the food. We'd start with breakfast at six, before the game viewing expedition, then there would be a stop for coffee and biscuits halfway round, when the guide would find an appropriate place to stop. One of the finest was a secluded island that Tuelo took us to through a seemingly impenetrable reed bed. Later there was lunch, followed almost immediately by tea, then the evening game viewing with its break for sundowners. The evening meal was a serious affair, where all the African staff of the camp would gather to welcome the guests with traditional songs in Setswana, and dance in the communal dining room as the insects chugged and whistled towards the lights and the hippos bellowed in the distance. The head chef for the three camps, Heather, had worked in five-star restaurants all over the world, including Princess Diana's old haunt Daphne's; we ate a lot of local fruits and vegetables, beef and fresh fish and even, on one occasion, impala steaks, which were exquisite but chafed at my conscience the next day when we came across some impala who stared at us accusingly with their big, chocolate eyes. The final camp, Kwai River Lodge, brought the elephants back; we would sit at the bar and watch them bathing in the river, the occasional lone hippo shambling by on the far bank. Our guide took us for a night drive in search of cheetahs, who cruise through the bush with extraordinary night vision; we found fresh tracks, but no cheetahs. The drive itself was such an experience, though, we hardly minded. The landscape seems limitless in the dark, the noises magnified, the scent of grasses and sage heavier. As we sat around the campfire on the last night, we began to question quite seriously why anyone would choose to live in London. Of course, daily life in Botswana is not quite like being at a Gametrackers Camp, which is why they don't come cheap, but if you're going to go on safari, you'll probably only do it once, so you might as well do it in style. And you will seriously start plotting ways to avoid ever going home; to my disappointment, a few thinly veiled enquiries revealed that there wasn't much call for on-site writers at the camps.

      "body": "<p>'Fabulous three-bed apartment. Amazing location, within spitting distance of Buckingham Palace and the Houses of Parliament. Contemporary designer interiors. Must be seen.' </p> <p>Welcome to 51 Buckingham Gate and the secret world of the serviced apartment. The long limestone-floored hallway is gently lit, with doorways at regular intervals, leading into the living room - a huge space with tasteful art on the walls and oversized, comfy sofas in shades of cream, beige and aubergine. There is a master bedroom and two others with en suite bathrooms. The kitchen is fitted out in ultra-modern stainless steel. </p> <p>The apartment was designed by Noel Pierce, whose portfolio of work includes The Dorchester and the Peninsula Hotel in Hong Kong. He knows a thing or two about luxurious living. The bedlinen is made of the finest Egyptian cotton. The bathrooms are spacious, light and airy, with limestone floors and sleek Philippe Starck fittings - the sort you find in five-star hotels and fantasise about having in your own home. </p> <p>But this is not a showflat for some grand new loft-style development. You are not being asked for a fat deposit to buy the place. You are simply being asked for \u00a3630 to spend the night, with as many of your closest family and friends as you like. You can cook dinner. You can even throw a party and invite everyone to stay over. </p> <p>For an increasing number of travellers, hotels - even the poshest - are simply too much like, well, hotels. Some may be cosier than others. London's Covent Garden Hotel, for instance, is regularly a 'home from home' for stars, who love the fact that you can curl up with dinner in front of the fire in the upstairs lounge, topping up drinks all night from the honesty bar. Long-term guests have included Cate Blanchett, Ethan Hawke, Christina Ricci and Jessica Lange. </p> <p>But for guests who are after total privacy, or simply a place where the whole family can stay without running up huge bills on room service and breakfast buffets, the Covent Garden Hotel has another option: Durley House on Sloane Street. This is where Americans such as Blaine Trump regularly book in. She treats it not so much as a hotel, but as a pied-\u00e0-terre - with maid service, private gardens, breakfast, fluffy towels and tennis courts all included. The house is decorated by co-owner, Kit Kemp, in an elegant, modern English style. There is even a piano suite which comes complete with its own baby grand, a favourite of the conductor, Zubin Mehta, when he's in town. </p> <p>There are a surprising number of serviced apartments in London, ranging from the break-the-bank deluxe, to the basic and affordable. All are designed to have all the comforts of home - and add a maid, room service, and, in the case of 51 Buckingham Gate, your own butler if required. </p> <p>Roy McKenzie set up in business last year, with londonservicedapartments.co.uk. He acts as an online agent, pairing up clients with their dream home - however temporary. 'I still think it's a secret, but a growing one,' he says. His list ranges from Citadine in London's Covent Garden, where a basic studio apartment for two will set you back just \u00a3102 per night (less if you stay for a week or more), to the seriously chic No 5 Maddox Street in Mayfair. No 5 calls itself 'the hotel alternative' . It has just 12 apartments, and offers guests not only a fashionably bamboo-floored Zen pad to call their own for as long as they like, but the option of 24-hour room service, a chef who will cook in your kitchen for you and your guests, personal grocery shopping, a visit from the Jet Lag clinic, and Muji bikes to cycle around the city. Prices range from \u00a3215 to \u00a3550 per night. </p> <p>'The serviced apartment appeals to people at the economy end, who simply want to save on the cost of a hotel, to others who like the extra space and privacy, or the business traveller who wants to bring their family and lead a relatively normal life,' says McKenzie. He recently recommended 13 Half Moon Street in Mayfair for a film-production company in search of a traditional apartment with chandeliers. Not only is there a chandelier, there's enough room to swing on it too. And in the discreet world of the serviced apartment, no one would bat an eyelid. </p> <p> <strong> 51 Buckingham Gate</strong> <br> Luxury Suites and Apartments, London SW1 <a href=\"http://www.51-buckinghamgate.co.uk\">www.51-buckinghamgate.co.uk</a><br> phone 020 7769 7766.</p> <p> Set in a beautiful Edwardian courtyard, the apartments were built in 1901 and recently refurbished by Noel Pierce.

      "bodyText": "'Fabulous three-bed apartment. Amazing location, within spitting distance of Buckingham Palace and the Houses of Parliament. Contemporary designer interiors. Must be seen.' Welcome to 51 Buckingham Gate and the secret world of the serviced apartment. The long limestone-floored hallway is gently lit, with doorways at regular intervals, leading into the living room - a huge space with tasteful art on the walls and oversized, comfy sofas in shades of cream, beige and aubergine. There is a master bedroom and two others with en suite bathrooms. The kitchen is fitted out in ultra-modern stainless steel. The apartment was designed by Noel Pierce, whose portfolio of work includes The Dorchester and the Peninsula Hotel in Hong Kong. He knows a thing or two about luxurious living. The bedlinen is made of the finest Egyptian cotton. The bathrooms are spacious, light and airy, with limestone floors and sleek Philippe Starck fittings - the sort you find in five-star hotels and fantasise about having in your own home. But this is not a showflat for some grand new loft-style development. You are not being asked for a fat deposit to buy the place. You are simply being asked for \u00a3630 to spend the night, with as many of your closest family and friends as you like. You can cook dinner. You can even throw a party and invite everyone to stay over. For an increasing number of travellers, hotels - even the poshest - are simply too much like, well, hotels. Some may be cosier than others. London's Covent Garden Hotel, for instance, is regularly a 'home from home' for stars, who love the fact that you can curl up with dinner in front of the fire in the upstairs lounge, topping up drinks all night from the honesty bar. Long-term guests have included Cate Blanchett, Ethan Hawke, Christina Ricci and Jessica Lange. But for guests who are after total privacy, or simply a place where the whole family can stay without running up huge bills on room service and breakfast buffets, the Covent Garden Hotel has another option: Durley House on Sloane Street. This is where Americans such as Blaine Trump regularly book in. She treats it not so much as a hotel, but as a pied-\u00e0-terre - with maid service, private gardens, breakfast, fluffy towels and tennis courts all included. The house is decorated by co-owner, Kit Kemp, in an elegant, modern English style. There is even a piano suite which comes complete with its own baby grand, a favourite of the conductor, Zubin Mehta, when he's in town. There are a surprising number of serviced apartments in London, ranging from the break-the-bank deluxe, to the basic and affordable. All are designed to have all the comforts of home - and add a maid, room service, and, in the case of 51 Buckingham Gate, your own butler if required. Roy McKenzie set up in business last year, with londonservicedapartments.co.uk. He acts as an online agent, pairing up clients with their dream home - however temporary. 'I still think it's a secret, but a growing one,' he says. His list ranges from Citadine in London's Covent Garden, where a basic studio apartment for two will set you back just \u00a3102 per night (less if you stay for a week or more), to the seriously chic No 5 Maddox Street in Mayfair. No 5 calls itself 'the hotel alternative' . It has just 12 apartments, and offers guests not only a fashionably bamboo-floored Zen pad to call their own for as long as they like, but the option of 24-hour room service, a chef who will cook in your kitchen for you and your guests, personal grocery shopping, a visit from the Jet Lag clinic, and Muji bikes to cycle around the city. Prices range from \u00a3215 to \u00a3550 per night. 'The serviced apartment appeals to people at the economy end, who simply want to save on the cost of a hotel, to others who like the extra space and privacy, or the business traveller who wants to bring their family and lead a relatively normal life,' says McKenzie. He recently recommended 13 Half Moon Street in Mayfair for a film-production company in search of a traditional apartment with chandeliers. Not only is there a chandelier, there's enough room to swing on it too. And in the discreet world of the serviced apartment, no one would bat an eyelid. 51 Buckingham Gate Luxury Suites and Apartments, London SW1 www.51-buckinghamgate.co.uk phone 020 7769 7766. Set in a beautiful Edwardian courtyard, the apartments were built in 1901 and recently refurbished by Noel Pierce. They are equipped with satellite TV, DVD players and luxury kitchens. Services include health spa, 24-hour room service, concierge and butler, trained by Ivor Spencer, who provides staff for Buckingham Palace. From \u00a3240 for a deluxe studio. Durley House 115 Sloane Street, London SW1 www.firmdale.com phone 020 7235 5537 Durley House is part of the Firmdale chain of boutique hotels owned by Kit and Tim Kemp. It offers a smart address, absolute luxury and privacy, as well as its own gardens and tennis courts. Durley House is offering special Christmas rates per night from 15 December to 15 January. One-bedroom suite \u00a3200 (usually from \u00a3250); piano suite \u00a3400 (usually from \u00a3480). Athenaeum Hotel &amp; Apartments 116 Piccadilly, London W1 020 7499 3464 www.athenaeumhotel.com Next door to the grand Athenaeum Hotel in central London is a terrace of Edwardian townhouses for guests who want as little or as much hotel service as they choose. There is a twice-daily maid service and use of all the hotel facilities, including gym and spa, but, for the length of your visit at least, you can pretend that this refuge in the middle of Piccadilly is your home. Prices range from \u00a3395 per night for a studio suite, to \u00a3695 for the penthouse. No 5 Maddox Street Mayfair, London W1 020 7647 0200 email to no5maddoxst@living-rooms.co.uk These apartments claim to balance 'the peace of the East with state-of-the-art technology, contemporary design and comfort'. There are just 12 apartments, and guests can cook for themselves in their own kitchens, invite a chef to do it for them, or use the 24-hour room service. For snacks and drinks, there are two mini bars, marked 'good' and 'bad' - one of which yields Yogi tea and herbal energy drinks and the other gin and Ben and Jerry's ice cream. Prices range from \u00a3215, to \u00a3385 per night. Citadine 94-99 High Holborn, London WC1V (central reservations, phone 020 7766 3800). Basic, economy apartments but great central location close to Covent Garden and theatres. Prices start at \u00a3108 per night for a studio, to \u00a3159 for a four-person apartment. 13 Half Moon Mayfair, London W1 www.no13halfmoonstreet.co.uk Telephone 020 7409 0207 Ten traditional suites in a Georgian town house next door to the Flemings Mayfair Hotel but guests have their own entry to this 1730 listed building.

There is hardly anything in his last decades which need detain us. He had a fairly disastrous impact on English poetry, egging a lot of Victorians into a poisonous vein of the faux naif.

Previous generations used to laugh at some of Wordsworth's simplest things, seeing them as bathetic. But the whole magic of Wordsworth is in a simple word. His most marvellous things have an inexplicable gravity and solemnity. The 'Westminster' sonnet leaps into life at the lines: 'Silent, bare/ Ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie/ Open unto the fields, and to the sky;/ All bright and glittering in the smokeless air'. The lines, so often ridiculed, about the man who says: 'I measured it from side to side/ 'Twas three feet long, and two feet wide', have a quite terrifying power; how anyone could laugh at the size of the grave of a child, set out like this, is beyond explanation. </p> <p>The most famous of the 'Lucy' poems has a simple, weighty climax as far beyond criticism as the best of Blake: 'No motion has she now, no force/She neither hears nor sees;/ Rolled round in earth's diurnal course,/ With rocks, and stones, and trees'. </p> <p>Simplifying the poetic language was very much what Wordsworth claimed to be doing. But, in truth, that was only part of his achievement. The ballads are as much literary constructs as the great Pindaric ode, 'Intimations of Immortality'. He retained a highly literary, even Miltonic sense of the uses of the Latinate word - diurnal or jocund. He no more invented the literary ballad than he discovered the Lake District as a picturesque destination. Even at his high period, he is a much more varied poet than his own accounts suggest, and a much more mysterious one. </p> <p>The life is a fascinating and a rewarding one, though offering little in the way of scandalous bad behaviour. Any rumoured scandal tends to dissolve under scrutiny - the incestuous relationship with Dorothy seems unlikely, and the suggestion that he acted as a British government spy in France rests on a confusion of Wordsworth with another man of the same name. </p> <p>But Wordsworth was still extraordinary. He was a man of unique energy, capable of walking dozens of miles in a day, enterprising enough to travel to Europe in the early 1790s and see the French Revolution at first hand. He was profoundly decent, universally generous with his time and support, and continued to be interested in absolutely anything under the sun. </p> <p>Juliet Barker has written a detailed, rich and tactful biography of huge value and interest. She has delved deep, and comes up with an extraordinarily sympathetic and constantly engaging portrait. I would have welcomed a little more of a sense of Wordsworth's deep roots in eighteenth-century poetry, which here gets dismissed a little briskly, but it is difficult to argue with any conviction against a book so intricately fascinated with the period, which convinces on every page. </p> <p>You feel that she understands her subject, not excusing or glossing over his occasional lapses, such as abandoning his wife, Annette Vallon, and her daughter in France, but always seeing the reasons for his behaviour. </p> <p>The only blot is a disgracefully negligent index. In a book of this size and this value, one needs a bit of help, but Viking has produced an index which is useless, just a list of page numbers. The name of Dorothy Wordsworth is followed by nearly 400 separate page numbers, but if you want to know anything in particular, you will just have to fish around helplessly. I hope, before the paperback, Viking does one of our best biographers proud by producing an index worthy of a remarkable book.</p>",

She was just so plausible. </p> <p>'Ducks and geese are migrating birds and before migrating they gorge themselves with food and store it in their livers for the long journey ahead,' she lectured us. 'Farmed birds have lost the instinct for migration but they still have the same digestive system. Force-feeding does not hurt them because there is no obstruction in their necks, and they have a gizzard instead of a stomach. </p> <p>'The ducks feed themselves normally in the open until they are four months old,' she said - for confirmation, we asked to see them ranging free - 'then I force-feed them with a half-kilo of maize each day for 12 days, then I kill them. In those 12 days the ducks themselves do not grow but their livers grow from 50 grammes to 500 grammes.' And then, as if to clinch her argument: 'If I didn't kill them, their livers would return to normal.' </p> <p>The liver, and every other salvageable part of the duck including the gizzard and neck, is turned into pt\u00e9, terrine, rillette, galantine or confit.

That debate has been postponed, but Nick Gibb, junior Conservative DTI spokesman, intends to argue the case in the rescheduled debate later this month. It will be the first time a major political party has seriously put forward the construction of nuclear power stations since the idea for a third reactor at Sizewell was abandoned in the early Nineties.

      "body": "<p> It doesn't take long to find the essence of Alaska. Just get off the plane at Anchorage - if you're lucky it'll be above freezing - and the first person you bump into will more likely than not be called Brad, wear a lumberjack shirt, work in oil, have a pick-up truck with twin gun racks and ask you: 'Did you know Alaska is a third the size of the lower 48 states and it's only got 600,000 people, 300,000 of them are in Anchorage?' The second question they ask is: 'Have you come for the fishing?' </p> <p>Alaskans are rightly proud of their state's size. It oozes bigness. It is wild and it is empty. It has north America's highest mountain, and its last true wilderness. It has the world's most dramatic fjords with glaciers crashing into them. Before I walked from the suburbs of Anchorage up the sharp 4,500ft Wolverine Peak, the taxi driver warned me to be careful of bears. Like yeah, right by the city I thought. </p> <p>'Yeah!', said the few walkers I met, all with their bear-bells tinkling away, before regaling me with stories of bear attacks in the suburbs. </p> <p>Not that bears are the only problem. Last year, a man got trampled to death by a moose outside his son's school in Anchorage. It was caught on video, and, of course, it was shown repeatedly on the news. 'I thought that was a bit tasteless,' said an Alaskan called Brad on top of Wolverine Peak, Anchorage stretching out to the sea below, and endless wilderness behind. </p> <p>Everything about Alaska has bigness, including the people (they have to make their bar stools especially wide). Everyone has a car but they also have two-, four-, six-seater planes. With very few roads, and such vast distances, it is the only real way to get about once you leave the cities. As you drive into Anchorage, you find a lake which is a boatplane equivalent of a car park. </p> <p>Both main airports have vast areas set aside for private aircraft. That's the poor people's private planes. Anyone who is even middle income appears to have their own landing strip in their backyard. As you circle above the suburbs of Fairbanks, Alaska's second city, each house has a car on the drive and a plane on the landing strip. </p> <p>Alaska is the last frontier. On the north coast, you can visit the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. This, too, is vast, home to teeming caribou, the nearly extinct pre-historically shaggy musk ox, grizzly bears, golden eagles, moose, polar bears and snow geese. </p> <p>It has been dubbed 'America's Serengeti' but, unlike the Tanzanian park, it has no roads, not even any human trails, huts, or landing strips. It is pure wilderness, as wild as it was before the advent of man. The only way you can visit it is by chartering a plane. As you weave in and out of the mountains and foothills, the pilot will find a gravel bank of a river to land on, drop you, and agree to pick you up at the same time, same place the following week. </p> <p>In between, it's just you, your guide, and Mother Nature. </p> <p>Alaska is famous for being cold, and rightly so. In the little village of Barrow on the north coast last year, it plunged to minus 77C (-107F). It's so cold, the tyres on cars freeze solid. The flat part in contact with the road when you park stays frozen flat as you drive off, giving a bumpy ride and a noise like 'ker-klunk, ker-klunk, ker-klunk' for 10 miles until the rubber warms up. </p> <p>One Alaskan told me he didn't mind the cold: 'I look upon it as population control.' In the spring, people from the rest of the US come to Alaska, fall in love 'but by December, they're usually aching to get back,' he said. </p> <p>And while it's cold, it's dark. In winter you get little or no light - but there is some compensation. Fairbanks declares itself the 'Northern Lights capital of the world', with stunning red, green, blue curtains of light dancing across the sky 220 nights a year. In the newspapers, they carry not just weather forecasts, but aurora forecasts. The dark winter also means a light summer, when days literally never end and merge one into another at the midnight sun. </p> <p>I bumped into the Bishop of Alaska - he said it's the Anglican church's biggest diocese - while he commuted from church to church by plane. As the Right Rev Mark McDonald gave me a lift to the airport in his pick-up, he announced with delight that his wife had got buffalo for dinner: it made a nice change to caribou, which was their usual meat. 'How did she get that?' I asked. 'In the supermarket?' 'Possibly, though she might have shot it,' said the bishop. The Alaskans are big on hunting, but they do it for food. 'The one thing that unites the whites and the natives is disgust at the trophy hunters who come up here from Texas and shoot a moose just to cut its head off and stuff it,' said McDonald, 'It's just such a waste.' </p> <p>Many of the native Americans still subsist off wild animals. The Gwich'in tribe of Athabascan Indians live off the caribou that migrate through their remote land in the far north of Alaska, as they have for the last 10,000 years. </p> <p>In the community of Arctic Village, a hundred miles north of the Arctic Circle, and 100 miles from any other human habitation, the young men spend months dividing their time between hunting caribou and playing computer games. It's a haunting land of stunted trees and moss-clad tundra, encircled by hulking mountains. </p> <p>Two feet down the soil is frozen all year round, forming an impenetrable layer that forces water to coalesce into endless pools, lakes, and meandering, directionless, lazy riverlets. </p> <p>The log cabins of Arctic Village, its store with just a few tins in it, its wooden church, and gravel roads with no cars, have a cosy, friendly atmosphere. You can chat with the locals, whose mother tongue is now English, or walk up to the mountain. I went in surprisingly warm summer days, but a guide told me it was better to visit in winter: it's more unusual, haunting, and you have the staggering, almost endless displays of Northern Lights. </p> <p>The only trouble is that with temperatures so low, your plane may get 'weathered in' and you'll spend more days in there than you planned.</p> <p><strong>Getting there </strong></p> <p>Flights from London to Anchorage start at about \u00a3450, They usually require two changes </p> <p>Internal flights are available from Alaskan Airlines 00 1 800 252 7522 and also Frontier Flying Service 00 1 907 474 0014</p> <p>Tours of Arctic Village are organised by Arctic Village Tours 00 1 907 479 46 48, <a href=\"http://www.arcticvillagetours.com\">www.arcticvillagetours.com</a> or email the company on <a href=\"mailto:alaska@arcticvillagetours.com\">alaska@arcticvillagetours.com</a>.</p> <p>Trips to the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge are organised by Alaska Wilderness Journeys 00 1 907 733 4444.</p> <p>Other tours are organised by Northern Alaskan Tour Company 00 1 907 474 8600 and North Star Adventures 00 1 570 297 4015 441552.</p>",

Before I walked from the suburbs of Anchorage up the sharp 4,500ft Wolverine Peak, the taxi driver warned me to be careful of bears. Like yeah, right by the city I thought. 'Yeah!', said the few walkers I met, all with their bear-bells tinkling away, before regaling me with stories of bear attacks in the suburbs. Not that bears are the only problem. Last year, a man got trampled to death by a moose outside his son's school in Anchorage. It was caught on video, and, of course, it was shown repeatedly on the news. 'I thought that was a bit tasteless,' said an Alaskan called Brad on top of Wolverine Peak, Anchorage stretching out to the sea below, and endless wilderness behind. Everything about Alaska has bigness, including the people (they have to make their bar stools especially wide). Everyone has a car but they also have two-, four-, six-seater planes. With very few roads, and such vast distances, it is the only real way to get about once you leave the cities. As you drive into Anchorage, you find a lake which is a boatplane equivalent of a car park. Both main airports have vast areas set aside for private aircraft. That's the poor people's private planes. Anyone who is even middle income appears to have their own landing strip in their backyard. As you circle above the suburbs of Fairbanks, Alaska's second city, each house has a car on the drive and a plane on the landing strip. Alaska is the last frontier. On the north coast, you can visit the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. This, too, is vast, home to teeming caribou, the nearly extinct pre-historically shaggy musk ox, grizzly bears, golden eagles, moose, polar bears and snow geese. It has been dubbed 'America's Serengeti' but, unlike the Tanzanian park, it has no roads, not even any human trails, huts, or landing strips. It is pure wilderness, as wild as it was before the advent of man. The only way you can visit it is by chartering a plane. As you weave in and out of the mountains and foothills, the pilot will find a gravel bank of a river to land on, drop you, and agree to pick you up at the same time, same place the following week. In between, it's just you, your guide, and Mother Nature. Alaska is famous for being cold, and rightly so. In the little village of Barrow on the north coast last year, it plunged to minus 77C (-107F). It's so cold, the tyres on cars freeze solid. The flat part in contact with the road when you park stays frozen flat as you drive off, giving a bumpy ride and a noise like 'ker-klunk, ker-klunk, ker-klunk' for 10 miles until the rubber warms up. One Alaskan told me he didn't mind the cold: 'I look upon it as population control.' In the spring, people from the rest of the US come to Alaska, fall in love 'but by December, they're usually aching to get back,' he said. And while it's cold, it's dark. In winter you get little or no light - but there is some compensation. Fairbanks declares itself the 'Northern Lights capital of the world', with stunning red, green, blue curtains of light dancing across the sky 220 nights a year. In the newspapers, they carry not just weather forecasts, but aurora forecasts. The dark winter also means a light summer, when days literally never end and merge one into another at the midnight sun. I bumped into the Bishop of Alaska - he said it's the Anglican church's biggest diocese - while he commuted from church to church by plane. As the Right Rev Mark McDonald gave me a lift to the airport in his pick-up, he announced with delight that his wife had got buffalo for dinner: it made a nice change to caribou, which was their usual meat. 'How did she get that?' I asked. 'In the supermarket?' 'Possibly, though she might have shot it,' said the bishop. The Alaskans are big on hunting, but they do it for food. 'The one thing that unites the whites and the natives is disgust at the trophy hunters who come up here from Texas and shoot a moose just to cut its head off and stuff it,' said McDonald, 'It's just such a waste.' Many of the native Americans still subsist off wild animals. The Gwich'in tribe of Athabascan Indians live off the caribou that migrate through their remote land in the far north of Alaska, as they have for the last 10,000 years. In the community of Arctic Village, a hundred miles north of the Arctic Circle, and 100 miles from any other human habitation, the young men spend months dividing their time between hunting caribou and playing computer games. It's a haunting land of stunted trees and moss-clad tundra, encircled by hulking mountains. Two feet down the soil is frozen all year round, forming an impenetrable layer that forces water to coalesce into endless pools, lakes, and meandering, directionless, lazy riverlets. The log cabins of Arctic Village, its store with just a few tins in it, its wooden church, and gravel roads with no cars, have a cosy, friendly atmosphere. You can chat with the locals, whose mother tongue is now English, or walk up to the mountain. I went in surprisingly warm summer days, but a guide told me it was better to visit in winter: it's more unusual, haunting, and you have the staggering, almost endless displays of Northern Lights. The only trouble is that with temperatures so low, your plane may get 'weathered in' and you'll spend more days in there than you planned.

The accomplished Swede hails from Torsby, an area renowned not only for producing robust cross-country skiers, but locals who are excessively headstrong. </p> <p>Folklore has it that when the king once inquired of a champion skier, after a particularly gruelling race, how hard it had been, he was told: 'Go and try it yourself, old fart.' While Eriksson wouldn't dream of being impolite to royalty, nor the famous old farts at Lancaster Gate, he upholds his region's tradition of resoluteness. He can definitely stand the heat. </p> <p>The FA might just have found a face to fit. Yesterday they denied reports that the Lazio manager was out of the running after agreeing a new, long-term contract with the Italian club. Eriksson possesses a profound knowledge of European football, gathered while winning trophies all over the continent. He has an irreproachable character; never mind a skeleton in the cupboard, he barely has an enemy. </p> <p>Glenn Hysen, the former Liverpool defender who rates Eriksson as the defining influence on his career, is unequivocal. 'I don't think there is a job that has as much pressure as the England national team but he would definitely cope,' Hysen says. 'He is under pressure every day. Lazio is the kind of club where if they don't win something every year they complain. </p> <p>'The other day they lost to Verona, which was disastrous with so many big-name players, and they were slaughtered in the papers, with Sven getting his fair share too. But he waves it all off. That's the way it is, so why worry? It doesn't bother him. He's always been a very nice person, very down to earth. Still is.' </p> <p>The signs that Eriksson's unshakeable self-belief would prove a huge asset were evident from his first managerial appointment, at IFK Gothenburg. He was greeted with suspicion: only 31, fresh out of university clutching a coaching certificate, and carrying no reputation from his playing days, having spent most of his time as a defensive midfield player in the equivalent of the third division with Degerfors. </p> <p>Hysen remembers how it made for an awkward welcome: 'We thought it was a joke to start with because he was small, shy and very quiet. He doesn't look like a trainer really. He came from the forests up in V rmland. We were surprised the club had gone for someone like that.' </p> <p>An uncomfortable start was hurdled in the composed style for which he is now acclaimed. He decided to stick to his principles and offered to stand down if others didn't want to share his vision. 'We had a meeting after six or seven games, we were bottom of the table and everyone was panicking,' recalls Hysen. 'The club was upside down. He said: \"I can go if you want. We've started with a new way of playing and these things take time. If you can't be patient I can leave.\" We said: \"No, no, no.\" Nobody was against him. We carried on with the same methods and suddenly everything turned around. His training and ideas were great so everybody loved him, and responded, and made Gothenburg the well-respected club it is today. We all thank him for what he did for the club, and us, when he was there.' </p> <p>By the age of 34, Eriksson had guided IFK to an unexpected yet emphatic triumph in the Uefa Cup - in the process helping a clutch of players to develop from part-time to professional and international status. Eriksson's transformation was only just beginning. </p> <p>He moved to Benfica, who claimed the Portuguese Championship twice in succession, before beginning a love affair with Calcio. Hysen, who followed his mentor to Fiorentina, noticed how immersing himself in Italian football and culture added further strings to Eriksson's bow. Already a sound technical teacher, he broadened his tactical horizons. The pressing game he had favoured at Gothenburg became more refined. </p> <p>Personally, too, his Scandinavian reserve has been infused with a dash of Latin style and elegance, especially after his marriage to an Italian lawyer with film-star looks. At the same time Eriksson keeps his private life private, and returns once a year to the refuge of his Swedish summer house. </p> <p>His life has flourished in Italy and Hysen, now a TV commentator back in Sweden, doubts he would up sticks, for England or anywhere else. </p> <p>'To be honest, I don't think he'll take it. He's got it too good down there and I think he lives a perfect life in Italy. He's more relaxed, like Italians normally are. He said recently he's very flattered that everyone wants him - as coach for Sweden as well as England - but he's so Italian now in his way of life I don't think he'll take a job where he has to leave Italy. It's just my personal opinion. </p> <p>'If he does take the England job I don't see why he shouldn't do well,' says Hysen. But in the end it's up to the players. If the players are not good enough - and that might be the point right now - he is not a magician. He needs the players to do a job for him on the pitch.' </p> <p>That said, Eriksson's man management and motivation are the qualities that impressed Hysen most. 'The most important thing as a trainer is that he can take care of players. At big clubs like Lazio and Roma there's a group of maybe 20 good players. He has to drop six of them every game and still motivate them to go on. </p> <p>'These are big stars we are talking about. He can handle that situation no problem at all just by being human, by being himself. Some managers can be very big-headed because they are in charge of a great club, but he just takes people as they are. Some managers put you aside without an explanation, but he always tells you why. </p> <p>'He is very clever about handling players in different situations. He's exactly the same now as he was starting out with us in Gothenburg. We all had jobs outside of football because it was part-time, and now he has millionaire stars, and he talks to them exactly the same way as he talked to us. That's why everybody respects him.' </p> <p>If Ars\u00e8ne Wenger was the FA's first-choice candidate, Eriksson is from the same mould. One disadvantage is his limited first-hand knowledge of English footballers, particularly those waiting in the wings. But it's not an insurmountable problem; it just needs time. </p> <p>If Eriksson accepts an invitation to London he would probably bring his number two with him. Tord Grip, assistant to Tommy Svensson when Sweden finished fourth in the 1994 World Cup, is his trusted buffer, which could put Peter Taylor and Steve McClaren in a delicate position. </p> <p>However, it's hard not to feel dismay over the fact that Lazio have refused the FA permission to talk to Eriksson until the end of the season. It would have been interesting to see Eriksson involved, even on a consultancy basis for England's trip to Italy - you can't help feeling he would have been in his element.</p>",

That's the way it is, so why worry? It doesn't bother him. He's always been a very nice person, very down to earth. Still is.' The signs that Eriksson's unshakeable self-belief would prove a huge asset were evident from his first managerial appointment, at IFK Gothenburg. He was greeted with suspicion: only 31, fresh out of university clutching a coaching certificate, and carrying no reputation from his playing days, having spent most of his time as a defensive midfield player in the equivalent of the third division with Degerfors. Hysen remembers how it made for an awkward welcome: 'We thought it was a joke to start with because he was small, shy and very quiet. He doesn't look like a trainer really. He came from the forests up in V rmland. We were surprised the club had gone for someone like that.' An uncomfortable start was hurdled in the composed style for which he is now acclaimed. He decided to stick to his principles and offered to stand down if others didn't want to share his vision. 'We had a meeting after six or seven games, we were bottom of the table and everyone was panicking,' recalls Hysen. 'The club was upside down. He said: \"I can go if you want. We've started with a new way of playing and these things take time. If you can't be patient I can leave.\" We said: \"No, no, no.\" Nobody was against him. We carried on with the same methods and suddenly everything turned around. His training and ideas were great so everybody loved him, and responded, and made Gothenburg the well-respected club it is today. We all thank him for what he did for the club, and us, when he was there.' By the age of 34, Eriksson had guided IFK to an unexpected yet emphatic triumph in the Uefa Cup - in the process helping a clutch of players to develop from part-time to professional and international status. Eriksson's transformation was only just beginning. He moved to Benfica, who claimed the Portuguese Championship twice in succession, before beginning a love affair with Calcio. Hysen, who followed his mentor to Fiorentina, noticed how immersing himself in Italian football and culture added further strings to Eriksson's bow. Already a sound technical teacher, he broadened his tactical horizons. The pressing game he had favoured at Gothenburg became more refined. Personally, too, his Scandinavian reserve has been infused with a dash of Latin style and elegance, especially after his marriage to an Italian lawyer with film-star looks. At the same time Eriksson keeps his private life private, and returns once a year to the refuge of his Swedish summer house. His life has flourished in Italy and Hysen, now a TV commentator back in Sweden, doubts he would up sticks, for England or anywhere else. 'To be honest, I don't think he'll take it. He's got it too good down there and I think he lives a perfect life in Italy. He's more relaxed, like Italians normally are. He said recently he's very flattered that everyone wants him - as coach for Sweden as well as England - but he's so Italian now in his way of life I don't think he'll take a job where he has to leave Italy. It's just my personal opinion. 'If he does take the England job I don't see why he shouldn't do well,' says Hysen. But in the end it's up to the players. If the players are not good enough - and that might be the point right now - he is not a magician. He needs the players to do a job for him on the pitch.' That said, Eriksson's man management and motivation are the qualities that impressed Hysen most. 'The most important thing as a trainer is that he can take care of players. At big clubs like Lazio and Roma there's a group of maybe 20 good players. He has to drop six of them every game and still motivate them to go on. 'These are big stars we are talking about. He can handle that situation no problem at all just by being human, by being himself. Some managers can be very big-headed because they are in charge of a great club, but he just takes people as they are. Some managers put you aside without an explanation, but he always tells you why. 'He is very clever about handling players in different situations. He's exactly the same now as he was starting out with us in Gothenburg. We all had jobs outside of football because it was part-time, and now he has millionaire stars, and he talks to them exactly the same way as he talked to us. That's why everybody respects him.' If Ars\u00e8ne Wenger was the FA's first-choice candidate, Eriksson is from the same mould. One disadvantage is his limited first-hand knowledge of English footballers, particularly those waiting in the wings. But it's not an insurmountable problem; it just needs time. If Eriksson accepts an invitation to London he would probably bring his number two with him. Tord Grip, assistant to Tommy Svensson when Sweden finished fourth in the 1994 World Cup, is his trusted buffer, which could put Peter Taylor and Steve McClaren in a delicate position. However, it's hard not to feel dismay over the fact that Lazio have refused the FA permission to talk to Eriksson until the end of the season. It would have been interesting to see Eriksson involved, even on a consultancy basis for England's trip to Italy - you can't help feeling he would have been in his element.",

      "body": "<p>It was the moustache that told you everything you needed to know. The moment you saw the thing on Rupert Pupkin's upper lip in The King Of Comedy , you knew he was a man who thought he was funny but wasn't. More than that, he was convinced of what a tragedy it would be if the world was robbed of his comic gifts. Scorsese's 1983 classic about a man who wants his shot at fame so badly he'll kidnap his idol is brilliant and funny, yet scary. At the time, people thought the film was a step back from Taxi Driver and Raging Bull. These days, it is possible to argue that The King Of Comedy tackles the same territory as Taxi Driver but more effectively. But what you never foresaw coming out of the film was that Robert De Niro would have the most financially rewarding times of his career in mainstream comedies co-starring Saturday Night Live 's comic veterans. Still less that he would one day share the screen with a cartoon squirrel and moose duo. </p> <p>Nevertheless, there he is in The Adventures Of Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle, seeking world domination as the evil, monocled Fearless Leader in the movie adaptation of a surprisingly sophisticated kids cartoon from the Sixties that is little known this side of the Atlantic. Despite the cast (Rene Russo, Jason Alexander, Billy Crystal), it seems as likely to take off over here as a Captain Pugwash film sweeping America. </p> <p> Meet The Parents is a different matter. It has brought sweet relief to a movie industry that was experiencing severe autumn doldrums. The set-up is undeniably old-fashioned: a nervous young man (Ben Stiller) is trying to ask his girlfriend's intimidating father (De Niro) for her hand in marriage. </p> <p>Naturally, everything goes wrong as Stiller trips himself with untruths of spiralling insanity, which isn't wise when the man you are trying to impress has a lie detector handy. Neatly assembled by Austin Powers director Jay Roach, it keeps the jokes coming fast and stays almost schmaltz-free. And it has cleaned up at the box office, securing the number one spot three weeks running and heading comfortably for the critical $100 million mark. Coming after the success of Analyze This, it means De Niro, at 57, is suddenly a bankable film star for the first time. And although he has plenty of big dramatic roles in the pipeline, De Niro has admitted he is in the market for more comedies. </p> <p>That's another thing: these days, De Niro will talk the press. Not often, and when he does, he is still pretty reticent. But it is a start. At least now we know that Abbott And Costello Meet Frankenstein was a formative influence on his sense of humour. Stranger still, he is willing to do contrived magazine photo shoots. It seems he is finally unravelling the mystique he built for himself, one that backfired as the movies got worse and people decided his silence wasn't due to preserving a sense of mystery or privacy so much as truculence or plain dullness. </p> <p>Both Meet The Parents and Analyze This play on the De Niro persona. Analyze This, where he plays a troubled mob boss confessing all to shrink Billy Crystal, is a more direct parody of De Niro past. Meet The Parents just needs us to know, from the moment he appears on screen, that this will be a very intense man. And so it turns out. Equally importantly, De Niro is clearly comfortable working with Billy Crystal and Ben Stiller. Considering both what sort of man and actor De Niro seemed in the late Seventies and early Eighties, his current, self-mocking attitude is an interesting development. </p> <p>Dig a little deeper, and it turns out that comedy Bob predates mythical Seventies method madness De Niro. Almost unrecognisably round-faced and initially credited as Robert Denero, he got his start in a trio of films (The Wedding Party, Greetings and Hi, Mom!) directed by Brian De Palma (the idea that De Palma specialised in comedies back then is even weirder than De Niro's involvement). The first film he was in that involved the Mafia was a comedy called The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight, 28 years before Analyze This. That all changed when he established himself with Mean Streets and The Godfather: Part II. In the late Seventies, it would have been deemed almost insulting to ask De Niro to use his total immersion techniques for mere comedy. These days he is eager to reclaim the humourous edge to those roles. ' Taxi Driver: there's a lot of funny stuff in it. Really,' he insisted recently. </p> <p>No doubt some eager film student is writing a thesis joining the dots between Abbott and Costello and Travis Bickle right now. Still, during the decade of his pomp (1973's Mean Streets to 1984's Once Upon A Time In America) De Niro appeared in nothing that could be classified as a comedy. Which made it all the more surprising when he popped up briefly in Terry Gilliam's Brazil (1985). That seemed to launch De Niro's second comedy era, which produced one fine film (Midnight Run) and a notorious turkey (We're No Angels). Midnight Run remains the most underrated film of De Niro's career: in many ways, it's the least mannered performance he has ever given and proved once and for all that De Niro could be funny. Unfortunately, it was followed by We're No Angels. The match-up of De Niro with Sean Penn (and a script by David Mamet) looked enticing on paper but turned out to be a disaster. De Niro went back to interspersing Scorsese reunions (Goodfellas, Casino) with performances in films such as Backdraft and Frankenstein that belied De Niro's reputation as the greatest actor of his generation. One exception was the unsung Mad Dog And Glory in 1993, where De Niro and the masterful Bill Murray rubbed up effectively against each other. In the Nineties, De Niro's attempts to stretch himself were mainly involved trying to show his softer side in the likes of Awakenings and Marvin's Room. But the most his work in those films ever got him was a rather automatic admiration. </p> <p>It was another David Mamet script, for the political satire Wag The Dog, that refloated De Niro's comedy career. De Niro plays it straight, leaving Dustin Hoffman to indulge in unrestrained hamming. Wag The Dog still had the aura of a serious project about it. It was in Analyze This that it became clear he was committed to his comedy reinvention. The film may have been essentially lightweight, but it did the business. That De Niro produced both Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle and Meet The Parents shows he wasn't taking on the roles just for a quick payday. </p> <p>Not that he has stopped doing the serious parts. On its way to us is Flawless, a curiosity in which a bigoted security guard (De Niro) recovering from a stroke befriends a transsexual (Philip Seymour Hoffman). And there is Men Of Honor, in which a bigoted naval diving instructor learns to respect a courageous young black recruit (Cuba Gooding Jr). Whatever else De Niro has managed to come to terms with recently, quality control remains a problem. </p> <p>How much De Niro has really changed recently is hard to tell, simply because we continue to know so little about him. The shift in comedy seems a sharp move, especially since the gilt came off his icon a long time ago. Not only are the bulk of films De Niro appeared in the Eighties and Nineties forgettable if not downright bad, they make you question how good he really was in the good films. That is not to say that Raging Bull isn't a great film, but that Scorsese built his movies carefully around De Niro's limitations. And the extremes of method acting probably never added anything on screen, they just made for good stories. So it is probably healthier that he now seems to regard himself as a working actor, rather than conducting a continuing experiment in changing personalities. And that he can poke fun at his own legend. Which is why De Niro himself, and not just his accountant, is probably happier now he has gone from The King Of Comedy to being the king of comedy. </p> <p><strong> Comic timing: how Bob learnt to smile </strong> </p> <p><strong> Wag the Dog (1997) </strong> </p> <p>When the President is compromisingly caught with a girl scout, a ruthless spin doctor (De Niro) is called in to bury the story by whatever means including faking a war.

      "body": "<p>No matter how you dress it up, the bare facts are that we have to get a meal on the table for several people virtually every day of the year. Or, to be more accurate, several meals and snacks and treats and parties and, just now and again, we might like to have some friends round, too. No matter how much we like cooking and putting food out for others, it is still an unstoppable roller coaster of food, plates, pots and pans - and appetites. When one meal finishes we must start thinking about the next. And the next, and the next and the next. And there's more. We now need to consider the long-term implications of everything we put in our family's mouths; the likes and dislikes of everyone we are cooking for (a nightmare in itself); and cope with the nagging thought, 'Am I doing enough?' </p> <p>We alone know our own families, what they want, need, like and love. We know what they will wolf down uncomplainingly and when we may have to resort to what amounts to a softly-softly attempt at force-feeding. We alone know how far we are prepared to go to please them (answer: as far as we have to and further still). If I paint a somewhat bleak picture, I don't mean to: I mean only to be practical and to bring balance to the rose-tinted cookie-cutter images of family cooking given elsewhere. One thing I am sure of: every bone in my body believes that you should not try to force a child to eat something that he or she does not like. I say this having been one of those children who was forced to eat what my parents thought was good for me. </p> <p>Cooking for the family is more, much more, than simply getting a meal on the table for ourselves. It can and should be much more rewarding (though in truth it rarely feels like it). We can get an even bigger buzz out of it. Yet feeding others on a daily basis is different - we cannot skip supper or open a bottle of wine in lieu. We cannot (quite) put pasta on the table every night. </p> <p>I offer a few practical points here. You can find the cookie-cutter stuff elsewhere. </p> <p>\u0095 It will be easier for everyone if you get the whole family used to expecting the same food as soon as possible. I don't mean inflexibly so (we are surely past that now), but I do think there is much to be said for introducing what are considered 'adult' tastes into children's food as soon as possible. Why grate Cheddar to go on kids' pasta when they are going to have to get used to Parmesan sooner or later? Why introduce them to something that tastes skew-whiff when we are only going to have to put it right at some point anyway? </p> <p>\u0095 Most of us, I expect, don't even want to imagine a life without pasta - especially those of us with children.

For the sake of all-round peace and harmony, I think it sensible to make the most of this. </p> <p>\u0095 If noses are ever turned up at one type of pasta, then try another shape. This may sound simplistic, but I know my heart used to sink when I was presented with macaroni, while penne (those short, nib-shaped sticks) has always filled me with delight.

There is something of the feel-good factor about being the person with the overflowing ladle. </p> <p>\u0095 Introduce the family to your own spaghetti bolognaise before they start to get a taste for the ready-made stuff. </p> <p>\u0095 Get the kids cooking - or at least helping you out a bit - as soon as they show even the slightest interest in the kitchen. </p> <p>\u0095 No matter how much time it may save, don't serve up yesterday's leftovers when you come in from work. You will only feel wretched. Better to cook no more than you need of most things, except mash and boiled potatoes, which make great potato cakes and saut\u00e9ed potatoes - and are often better than they were the first time round. </p> <p>\u0095 Despite the depression that most leftovers bring to the table, I have never found a cold roast has the same effect. There is something quite cheering about finding enough cold meat left on a joint to make a sandwich or a salad. The trick is to bring it to room temperature rather than serve it straight from the fridge, and to add a fresh, pungent sauce and a groovy, knife-sharp salad. Try piquant sauce and some rocket leaves, and thinly shaved Manchego cheese. </p> <p>\u0095 It is worth remembering those dishes that do improve overnight, such as curry, stew and braised lamb. Cook them when you are in the mood and have the time, perhaps at the weekend, then refrigerate them for a night or two, bringing them out for a slow, thorough reheat one evening when you are feeling particularly exhausted. Forty-eight hours in the cool will do wonders for lamb braise and oxtail stew, for example. </p> <p>\u0095 No one can convince me that children do not like strong flavours. I know I did. Think of the tastes children enjoy: tomato ketchup, flavoured crisps, Marmite. They are all incredibly powerful flavours. How can we say olives are too strong for children when they will happily eat a bag of salt-and-vinegar crisps? Children who quail at the idea of garlic are often happy to tuck into your spaghetti bolognaise. In other words, the idea of garlic is often more frightening than the real thing. We just have to start them early enough - though we should probably abandon any attempts at getting them to eat capers. </p> <p>\u0095 Pudding is not essential and I don't think it is a habit we want to get into every day. Fruit is fine if it is ripe and luscious enough. And if you are very good you can have some ice cream, too. </p> <p>\u0095 I see no reason why we can't resort to a little bribery to get children to try something new. I mean, who hasn't occasionally found themselves trading off the odd forkful of something green and healthy for a spoonful of something more appealing? For the record, you get one small ball of Ben &amp; Jerry's for six forkfuls of spring greens. But no amount of bribery on earth would get me to like eggs when I was a child, and I still dislike them to this day. What I shall never know is whether I might have grown to like them had they not been forced down me by a well meaning but ultimately foolish parent. </p> <p>\u0095 I have always been a lone cook, finding 'help' in the kitchen more trouble than it's worth. OK, so I can't delegate, but I do rope people in to help peel the spuds, pull currants from their stalks and top-and-tail gooseberries. The kind of company I do like in the kitchen is someone who stands and gossips while I cook, and keeps the glasses topped up. But it is always nice to be asked if you need a hand. </p> <p><strong>An earthy, meal-in-a-bowl-type soup</strong></p> <p>Deep, dark, bass notes here. One of those swamp-like soups that gives much in the way of sustenance and warmth. I have offered this at big lunches for friends - a vast, bubbling cauldron of it, setting it down among the bread and cheese. Enough for 4 as a main course. </p> <p><strong> 2 small onions or 1 large one </strong><br> <strong> olive oil </strong><br> <strong> 3 or 4 cloves of garlic </strong><br> <strong> a good handful of diced unsmoked bacon or pancetta </strong><br> <strong> a small bunch of flat-leafed parsley </strong><br> <strong> a good 2 handfuls (250g) of green or brown lentils - maybe Puy or Castelluccio </strong><br> <strong> about a litre of stock or water - enough to cover the lentils completely </strong><br> <strong> 2 or 3 big handfuls of spinach </strong><br> <strong> a lemon </strong><br> <strong> a small bunch of mint - leaves only </strong></p> <p> Peel the onions and chop them quite finely, then let them cook over a moderate to low heat with a little olive oil, the peeled and sliced garlic and the diced bacon. You want all to be golden and fragrant. Chop the parsley and stir it in. </p> <p>Wash the lentils thoroughly and pick them over for little stones, then stir them into the onions and bacon. Pour over the stock or water and bring to the boil, skimming off any froth that appears on the surface. You can add a bay leaf or two if you like. Turn the heat down so that the lentils simmer merrily, then almost cover the pot with a lid and leave until they are tender but far from collapse - about 30 minutes, depending on the age of your lentils. </p> <p>Wash the spinach very thoroughly and tear it up a bit. While it is still wet and dripping, put it into a shallow pan over a high heat and shut the lid tightly - you want it to cook in its own steam. After a minute or so, it will be limp and bright emerald green. Lift it out, squeeze it dry (I do this by pressing it against the side of the pan with a draining spoon), then divide it between four warm bowls. </p> <p>Season the soup with salt, black pepper, lemon juice and the torn mint leaves, tasting it as you go. Ladle the hot soup on top of the spinach and serve with more lemon and mint for those who want it. </p> <p><strong>And more...</strong></p> <p> <strong> Haricot and tarragon soup </strong><br> Soak 250g of dried haricots overnight, then simmer them in unsalted water for 30 minutes. Drain and add to the onions and bacon. Continue as in the lentil soup above, but obviously without the lentils. Instead of mint, try tarragon leaves, but add them earlier, say 15 minutes or so before the soup is due to be ready. There is no need to offer more herbs at the table, but the lemon juice will still be welcome, as will some lovely crusty bread. </p> <p> <strong> Cannellini and chilli soup </strong><br> Soak and cook the beans as in the haricot and tarragon soup above but this time add a couple of seeded and chopped fresh red chillies to the onions and bacon. Serve with a slick of olive oil floating on top, plus the lemon and the mint. </p> <p> <strong> Lentil soup with celery and mushrooms </strong><br> Add a stalk or two of celery, finely diced, to the onions and garlic in the basic recipe above. Some button mushrooms, cut into quarters, can be added just before the lentils, so that they colour and sweeten. They will add even more earthy notes to the soup. You may need a little more lemon. </p> <p> <strong> Lentil and bok choi soup </strong><br> Spinach leaves are not the only greens. Use any of the Chinese leaves, such as bok choi, mustard greens or Chinese broccoli. Don't be tempted to try this with the tarragon mentioned in the haricot soup above. It won't sit comfortably. </p> <p> <strong> Other good things to add to the basic soup </strong> <br>Worcestershire sauce; mushroom ketchup (or mushroom seasoning as it is called nowadays); dark soy - stir it in at the end of cooking; a wine glass of Madeira (fabulous) about 15 minutes before the soup is due to be ready; crushed, dried chillies added with the onions and garlic; a few florets of broccoli instead of the spinach - too healthy-sounding, I know, but it is just brilliant if you have used the purple-sprouting sort. </p> <p><strong>A cheap spaghetti supper</strong></p> <p> It's not just that this is a cheap supper but that it is put together from things we tend to have knocking around anyway. Its practical, almost puritan background is a bonus. The point is that crisp bacon and breadcrumbs work brilliantly with the long strings of pasta. It makes a change to have pasta without a sauce. A few glugs of oil at the end are lubricant enough. You can safely use any of the thin pasta family here instead of spaghetti: tagliatelle, tagliarini, fettuccine or linguine. I have used the wide, floppy ribbons of pappardelle before now. They all work. Try to get a mixture of breadcrumb sizes, they are more interesting to eat. </p> <p>Per person:</p> <p><strong> 2 thickish slices of white bread - crusts removed </strong><br> <strong> a thick handful (about 125g) of spaghetti </strong><br> <strong> a thick slice of butter </strong><br> <strong> olive oil </strong><br> <strong> 2 good-sized rashers of streaky bacon </strong><br> <strong> a small bunch of parsley - leaves only, roughly chopped </strong></p> <p> Whiz the bread to rough crumbs in a food processor, or grate it by hand. It won't hurt at all (in fact it will be a bonus) if some of the crumbs are on the large side. Put a big pan of water on to boil, salt it generously and shove in the pasta. Let it cook for about 8 or 9 minutes, till it is tender but chewy. </p> <p>Meanwhile, melt the butter in a frying pan with a little olive oil to stop it burning. Cut the bacon into short pieces and fry it in the butter till its fat is golden and the kitchen smells wonderful. Scoop the bacon out with a slotted spoon into a large, warm serving bowl. Add a bit more butter and oil to the butter and bacon fat in the pan and tip in the breadcrumbs. Stir them from time to time in the sizzling butter till they have turned a rich gold. You need to keep an eye on them because they appear as if they are never going to brown, and then suddenly they're almost black. </p> <p>Drain the pasta and toss it with the hot crumbs and any of their butter, the bacon and the parsley, and a little olive oil to moisten and flavour. </p> <p><strong>And more:</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Spaghetti with bacon, breadcrumbs and garlic </strong> <br> Crush a clove of garlic per person into the butter before you fry the crumbs. </p> <p> <strong> And with chillies </strong> <br> Crushed, dried chillies seem to work better here than fresh. The quantity depends on your heat threshold but start with a fat pinch or two per person, stirring them in with the crumbs. </p> <p> <strong> And with lemon and thyme </strong> <br> Remove fine, young thyme leaves from their stalks and add them to the pan with the bacon. Squeeze the juice of half a lemon into the bowl as you toss everything together. </p> <p> <strong> Thin pasta with anchovies and parsley </strong> <br> Chop two or three anchovy fillets per person and cook them in a little olive oil over a low heat with a small handful of chopped parsley and a couple of cloves of finely chopped garlic. When the garlic is soft and pale gold - the anchovies will have almost melted - tip into a warm serving bowl, then continue with the crumbs as in the blueprint above. A pinch or two of dried crushed chillies, added with the anchovies, goes well here, too. </p> <p> <strong> With roast tomatoes and basil </strong> <br> Toss any of the thin pasta here with some roast tomatoes. I think it worth squashing them a little, and including their seedy juices. Basil leaves, torn to shreds, and some black pepper will produce a heady, sweet-sharp supper. There is nothing to stop you shaking some toasted crumbs over at the end if you fancy. </p> <p> <strong> And with butter and Parmesan </strong><br> For each person grate 60g Parmesan or pecorino. I know this will look like a lot but generosity is the only route to take here. Toss the hot pasta with a thick slice of your freshest butter (you really should open a new packet for this, as the sweetness of the butter is the whole point) and the grated cheese. The two will melt into a thin sauce that will lightly coat the spaghetti. Spoon over more cheese at the table - or on the floor or the sofa or in bed or wherever else you may be eating this. </p> <p><strong>Really juicy, spicy meatballs</strong></p> <p> Do you ever get an urge for food that is deeply savoury, citrus and fiery? I find the pork, lime leaves and chillies that are so much a part of Thai and Vietnamese cooking will usually do the trick. The citrus and chillies turn up in noodle soups, but sometimes the savour I want can only come from meat. These meatballs, which I often drop into a savoury chicken broth, may well be what you are after. </p> <p><strong> a handful of smoked bacon or pancetta </strong><br> <strong> 500g minced pork </strong><br> <strong> groundnut oil </strong></p> <p>For the seasoning: </p> <p><strong> 2 shallots or 4 small spring onions </strong><br> <strong> 3 or 4 small, hot, red chillies </strong><br> <strong> a small bunch of coriander </strong><br> <strong> 4 lime leaves or 2 thick stalks of lemon grass </strong><br> <strong> 3 or 4 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed </strong></p> <p> Chop the shallots or spring onions finely, then chop the chillies even finer, first removing the seeds if you don't like things too hot. Scrub the roots of the coriander and chop them and the leaves finely, discarding the stems. Roll the lime leaves up and shred them finely, then chop them; if you are using lemon grass, discard the coarse outer leaves, then chop the tender inside leaves very thinly. All this can be done in a food processor. </p> <p>Chop the bacon or pancetta and add it, with the seasoning above, to the minced pork. Mix in a good pinch of salt, then cover with clingfilm (otherwise it will taint everything in your fridge) and leave to rest and chill for half an hour or more. </p> <p>Shape the seasoned pork into small balls. The size is up to you. If you flatten them slightly you will get more of that delectable savoury crust when you fry them. I tend to start with a ball of mince the size of a walnut in its shell, then flatten it slightly. To cook them, you will need to warm a little oil in a heavy frying pan, then lay the meatballs in - without crowding them - and let them colour enticingly on both sides before turning the heat down a bit and letting them cook all the way through. You should find them done after four or five minutes. Test one by breaking it open: the centre should be juicy but not especially pink. </p> <p> <strong>And more...</strong></p> <p> <strong> A European version </strong><br> Perhaps you are after something savoury without the chilli rush. Make and cook the balls as above.</p> <p><strong> a handful of smoked bacon or pancetta </strong><br> <strong>500g minced pork </strong><br> <strong>groundnut oil </strong></p> <p>For the seasoning: </p> <p><strong>a couple of plump and juicy cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed </strong><br> <strong>fontina - or other easy-melting cheese such as Gruy\u00e8re, roughly diced </strong><br> <strong>the grated zest of 1 medium-sized unwaxed lemon </strong><br> <strong>a palmful of leaves of thyme, chopped </strong></p> <p> <strong>And more...</strong></p> <p> <strong> Meatballs in a hot, refreshing broth </strong><br> A hot, herbal, citrus-chilli supper. One of my favourite things to eat involves serving the Thai-inspired meatballs in a hot, herb-scented chicken broth. You will need some good chicken stock - about a large cupful per person, and I really think it should be home-made but I suppose bought stuff will do (sometimes it just has to). Bring it to the boil with a smashed stalk of lemon grass or a couple of lime leaves and a couple of chopped red chillies, then let it simmer for a few minutes while you fry the meatballs. Drop them into a deep soup bowl, strain over the fragrant, piping-hot stock, then stir in some chopped mint leaves and some basil or coriander. </p> <p> <strong> And in a mild, consoling one </strong><br> If you have made the Euro-version with cheese and thyme, you can still turn the meatballs into a substantial soup-supper by using the same chicken broth but flavoured with lots of chopped, vivid green parsley instead of the lemon grass and chillies. </p> <p> <strong>A sponge pudding with its own sauce</strong></p> <p> I believe passionately in the power of sweet, homely puddings to cure all manner of ills. Warm, nannying, becalming. Tucking into a dairy-rich hot pudding is, I am sure, the adult version of breastfeeding. To have some such pudding recipes to hand can prove endlessly useful, especially the good-natured ones like this, where a few grams either way matters less than is usual with baking. I am not sure you will want anything too sturdy to precede this, unless you are in the depths of winter. Enough for 6.</p> <p><strong> 100g butter </strong><br> <strong> 175g caster sugar </strong><br> <strong> 1 lemon </strong><br> <strong> 2 medium-sized oranges </strong><br> <strong> 4 eggs </strong><br> <strong> 40g plain flour </strong><br> <strong> 400ml milk </strong></p> <p> Cream the butter and sugar together until they are light and fluffy and the colour of finest double cream. It is easiest to do this is in a food mixer, though you could do it by hand if your butter is soft and you are feeling athletic. Set the oven at 180 C/Gas 4. </p> <p>Grate the zest from the lemon, making sure none of the bitter white pith comes with it, then cut the fruit in half and squeeze the juice. Do the same with the oranges. </p> <p>Separate the eggs and add the yolks to the creamed butter and sugar. The mixture will curdle but I wouldn't let it worry you. Now add the flour and milk alternately, the mixer on slow to medium, so you end up with a soft, cake-like batter. Stir in the orange and lemon zest and then the juice. </p> <p>Beat the egg whites to stiff peaks with an electric beater, then fold them carefully, so as not to knock out the air, into the batter. Scrape into a heatproof mixing bowl or souffl\u00e9 dish so that the mixture comes about halfway up the sides. Stand the basin in a roasting tin half-filled with hot water, then carefully transfer it to the oven. Bake for an hour or so, until the top is puffed and golden - press it with your finger to test; it should feel spongy - cool for five minutes before serving. </p> <p> <strong>And more...</strong></p> <p> <strong> A lemon pudding </strong><br> Drop the oranges in favour of another two medium-sized lemons. If they are particularly juicy you may only need one. </p> <p> <strong> A chocolate pudding </strong><br> Into a large bowl put 150g self-raising flour, 2 tablespoons cocoa powder, 200g light soft brown sugar, 100g roughly chopped fine, dark chocolate, 200ml milk, a large knob of butter, melted, and a beaten egg. Mix well. Pour into a buttered pudding basin. Mix together 75g dark soft brown sugar, 75g golden caster sugar and 100g cocoa powder and scatter it on top. Pour in 400ml of almost boiling water. Put the pudding in a roasting tin of hot water and bake for 35-40 minutes at 180 C/Gas 4. </p> <p> <strong> A chocolate hazelnut pudding </strong><br> Add 50g finely chopped hazelnuts to the ingredients above. </p> <p> <strong> To serve </strong><br> The tartness of the lemon and orange puddings and the obscene richness of the chocolate version are cooled by the addition of double cream. Serve it by the jugful. The idea is that it merges lusciously with the pudding's intense, integral sauce. * </p> <p>\u0095 Visit <a href=\"http://www.nigelslater.co.uk\">www.nigelslater.co.uk</a> - recipes are updated daily.</p>",

      "bodyText": "No matter how you dress it up, the bare facts are that we have to get a meal on the table for several people virtually every day of the year. Or, to be more accurate, several meals and snacks and treats and parties and, just now and again, we might like to have some friends round, too. No matter how much we like cooking and putting food out for others, it is still an unstoppable roller coaster of food, plates, pots and pans - and appetites. When one meal finishes we must start thinking about the next. And the next, and the next and the next. And there's more. We now need to consider the long-term implications of everything we put in our family's mouths; the likes and dislikes of everyone we are cooking for (a nightmare in itself); and cope with the nagging thought, 'Am I doing enough?' We alone know our own families, what they want, need, like and love. We know what they will wolf down uncomplainingly and when we may have to resort to what amounts to a softly-softly attempt at force-feeding. We alone know how far we are prepared to go to please them (answer: as far as we have to and further still). If I paint a somewhat bleak picture, I don't mean to: I mean only to be practical and to bring balance to the rose-tinted cookie-cutter images of family cooking given elsewhere. One thing I am sure of: every bone in my body believes that you should not try to force a child to eat something that he or she does not like. I say this having been one of those children who was forced to eat what my parents thought was good for me. Cooking for the family is more, much more, than simply getting a meal on the table for ourselves. It can and should be much more rewarding (though in truth it rarely feels like it). We can get an even bigger buzz out of it. Yet feeding others on a daily basis is different - we cannot skip supper or open a bottle of wine in lieu. We cannot (quite) put pasta on the table every night. I offer a few practical points here. You can find the cookie-cutter stuff elsewhere. \u0095 It will be easier for everyone if you get the whole family used to expecting the same food as soon as possible. I don't mean inflexibly so (we are surely past that now), but I do think there is much to be said for introducing what are considered 'adult' tastes into children's food as soon as possible. Why grate Cheddar to go on kids' pasta when they are going to have to get used to Parmesan sooner or later? Why introduce them to something that tastes skew-whiff when we are only going to have to put it right at some point anyway? \u0095 Most of us, I expect, don't even want to imagine a life without pasta - especially those of us with children. Whatever the xenophobic meat-'n'-two-veggists say, pasta is now our national dish. The family no longer unites over a joint of beef. It unites over a bowl of pasta. For the sake of all-round peace and harmony, I think it sensible to make the most of this. \u0095 If noses are ever turned up at one type of pasta, then try another shape. This may sound simplistic, but I know my heart used to sink when I was presented with macaroni, while penne (those short, nib-shaped sticks) has always filled me with delight. Noodles are a joy beyond belief (you can even make a silly noise while slurping them up from the bowl), yet they are possibly the messiest way there is to feed a family. \u0095 Nothing sticks to the floor quite like spaghetti with tomato sauce and Parmesan. \u0095 If the entire family likes pasta, you can bet that they will also like rice, potato-based meals and even couscous. All are equally beige and becalming. I mean this in the nicest possible way. All provide a bland and satiating base to which you can add other favourite ingredients and serve with the same bountiful earth-mother generosity as a giant bowl of pasta pesto. \u0095 In winter, a huge cauldron of bean and vegetable soup is something you can dip into and heat up in small quantities any time someone comes in cold and hungry and wanting something 'big' to eat. There is something of the feel-good factor about being the person with the overflowing ladle. \u0095 Introduce the family to your own spaghetti bolognaise before they start to get a taste for the ready-made stuff. \u0095 Get the kids cooking - or at least helping you out a bit - as soon as they show even the slightest interest in the kitchen. \u0095 No matter how much time it may save, don't serve up yesterday's leftovers when you come in from work. You will only feel wretched. Better to cook no more than you need of most things, except mash and boiled potatoes, which make great potato cakes and saut\u00e9ed potatoes - and are often better than they were the first time round. \u0095 Despite the depression that most leftovers bring to the table, I have never found a cold roast has the same effect. There is something quite cheering about finding enough cold meat left on a joint to make a sandwich or a salad. The trick is to bring it to room temperature rather than serve it straight from the fridge, and to add a fresh, pungent sauce and a groovy, knife-sharp salad. Try piquant sauce and some rocket leaves, and thinly shaved Manchego cheese. \u0095 It is worth remembering those dishes that do improve overnight, such as curry, stew and braised lamb.

An earthy, meal-in-a-bowl-type soup Deep, dark, bass notes here. One of those swamp-like soups that gives much in the way of sustenance and warmth. I have offered this at big lunches for friends - a vast, bubbling cauldron of it, setting it down among the bread and cheese. Enough for 4 as a main course. 2 small onions or 1 large one olive oil 3 or 4 cloves of garlic a good handful of diced unsmoked bacon or pancetta a small bunch of flat-leafed parsley a good 2 handfuls (250g) of green or brown lentils - maybe Puy or Castelluccio about a litre of stock or water - enough to cover the lentils completely 2 or 3 big handfuls of spinach a lemon a small bunch of mint - leaves only Peel the onions and chop them quite finely, then let them cook over a moderate to low heat with a little olive oil, the peeled and sliced garlic and the diced bacon. You want all to be golden and fragrant. Chop the parsley and stir it in. Wash the lentils thoroughly and pick them over for little stones, then stir them into the onions and bacon. Pour over the stock or water and bring to the boil, skimming off any froth that appears on the surface. You can add a bay leaf or two if you like.

Cannellini and chilli soup Soak and cook the beans as in the haricot and tarragon soup above but this time add a couple of seeded and chopped fresh red chillies to the onions and bacon. Serve with a slick of olive oil floating on top, plus the lemon and the mint. Lentil soup with celery and mushrooms Add a stalk or two of celery, finely diced, to the onions and garlic in the basic recipe above. Some button mushrooms, cut into quarters, can be added just before the lentils, so that they colour and sweeten. They will add even more earthy notes to the soup. You may need a little more lemon. Lentil and bok choi soup Spinach leaves are not the only greens. Use any of the Chinese leaves, such as bok choi, mustard greens or Chinese broccoli. Don't be tempted to try this with the tarragon mentioned in the haricot soup above. It won't sit comfortably. Other good things to add to the basic soup Worcestershire sauce; mushroom ketchup (or mushroom seasoning as it is called nowadays); dark soy - stir it in at the end of cooking; a wine glass of Madeira (fabulous) about 15 minutes before the soup is due to be ready; crushed, dried chillies added with the onions and garlic; a few florets of broccoli instead of the spinach - too healthy-sounding, I know, but it is just brilliant if you have used the purple-sprouting sort. A cheap spaghetti supper It's not just that this is a cheap supper but that it is put together from things we tend to have knocking around anyway. Its practical, almost puritan background is a bonus. The point is that crisp bacon and breadcrumbs work brilliantly with the long strings of pasta. It makes a change to have pasta without a sauce. A few glugs of oil at the end are lubricant enough. You can safely use any of the thin pasta family here instead of spaghetti: tagliatelle, tagliarini, fettuccine or linguine. I have used the wide, floppy ribbons of pappardelle before now. They all work. Try to get a mixture of breadcrumb sizes, they are more interesting to eat. Per person: 2 thickish slices of white bread - crusts removed a thick handful (about 125g) of spaghetti a thick slice of butter olive oil 2 good-sized rashers of streaky bacon a small bunch of parsley - leaves only, roughly chopped Whiz the bread to rough crumbs in a food processor, or grate it by hand. It won't hurt at all (in fact it will be a bonus) if some of the crumbs are on the large side. Put a big pan of water on to boil, salt it generously and shove in the pasta. Let it cook for about 8 or 9 minutes, till it is tender but chewy. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a frying pan with a little olive oil to stop it burning. Cut the bacon into short pieces and fry it in the butter till its fat is golden and the kitchen smells wonderful. Scoop the bacon out with a slotted spoon into a large, warm serving bowl. Add a bit more butter and oil to the butter and bacon fat in the pan and tip in the breadcrumbs. Stir them from time to time in the sizzling butter till they have turned a rich gold. You need to keep an eye on them because they appear as if they are never going to brown, and then suddenly they're almost black. Drain the pasta and toss it with the hot crumbs and any of their butter, the bacon and the parsley, and a little olive oil to moisten and flavour. And more: Spaghetti with bacon, breadcrumbs and garlic Crush a clove of garlic per person into the butter before you fry the crumbs. And with chillies Crushed, dried chillies seem to work better here than fresh. The quantity depends on your heat threshold but start with a fat pinch or two per person, stirring them in with the crumbs. And with lemon and thyme Remove fine, young thyme leaves from their stalks and add them to the pan with the bacon. Squeeze the juice of half a lemon into the bowl as you toss everything together. Thin pasta with anchovies and parsley Chop two or three anchovy fillets per person and cook them in a little olive oil over a low heat with a small handful of chopped parsley and a couple of cloves of finely chopped garlic. When the garlic is soft and pale gold - the anchovies will have almost melted - tip into a warm serving bowl, then continue with the crumbs as in the blueprint above. A pinch or two of dried crushed chillies, added with the anchovies, goes well here, too. With roast tomatoes and basil Toss any of the thin pasta here with some roast tomatoes. I think it worth squashing them a little, and including their seedy juices. Basil leaves, torn to shreds, and some black pepper will produce a heady, sweet-sharp supper. There is nothing to stop you shaking some toasted crumbs over at the end if you fancy. And with butter and Parmesan For each person grate 60g Parmesan or pecorino. I know this will look like a lot but generosity is the only route to take here. Toss the hot pasta with a thick slice of your freshest butter (you really should open a new packet for this, as the sweetness of the butter is the whole point) and the grated cheese. The two will melt into a thin sauce that will lightly coat the spaghetti. Spoon over more cheese at the table - or on the floor or the sofa or in bed or wherever else you may be eating this. Really juicy, spicy meatballs Do you ever get an urge for food that is deeply savoury, citrus and fiery? I find the pork, lime leaves and chillies that are so much a part of Thai and Vietnamese cooking will usually do the trick. The citrus and chillies turn up in noodle soups, but sometimes the savour I want can only come from meat. These meatballs, which I often drop into a savoury chicken broth, may well be what you are after. a handful of smoked bacon or pancetta 500g minced pork groundnut oil For the seasoning: 2 shallots or 4 small spring onions 3 or 4 small, hot, red chillies a small bunch of coriander 4 lime leaves or 2 thick stalks of lemon grass 3 or 4 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed Chop the shallots or spring onions finely, then chop the chillies even finer, first removing the seeds if you don't like things too hot. Scrub the roots of the coriander and chop them and the leaves finely, discarding the stems. Roll the lime leaves up and shred them finely, then chop them; if you are using lemon grass, discard the coarse outer leaves, then chop the tender inside leaves very thinly. All this can be done in a food processor. Chop the bacon or pancetta and add it, with the seasoning above, to the minced pork. Mix in a good pinch of salt, then cover with clingfilm (otherwise it will taint everything in your fridge) and leave to rest and chill for half an hour or more. Shape the seasoned pork into small balls. The size is up to you. If you flatten them slightly you will get more of that delectable savoury crust when you fry them. I tend to start with a ball of mince the size of a walnut in its shell, then flatten it slightly. To cook them, you will need to warm a little oil in a heavy frying pan, then lay the meatballs in - without crowding them - and let them colour enticingly on both sides before turning the heat down a bit and letting them cook all the way through. You should find them done after four or five minutes. Test one by breaking it open: the centre should be juicy but not especially pink. And more... A European version Perhaps you are after something savoury without the chilli rush. Make and cook the balls as above. a handful of smoked bacon or pancetta 500g minced pork groundnut oil For the seasoning: a couple of plump and juicy cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed fontina - or other easy-melting cheese such as Gruy\u00e8re, roughly diced the grated zest of 1 medium-sized unwaxed lemon a palmful of leaves of thyme, chopped And more... Meatballs in a hot, refreshing broth A hot, herbal, citrus-chilli supper. One of my favourite things to eat involves serving the Thai-inspired meatballs in a hot, herb-scented chicken broth. You will need some good chicken stock - about a large cupful per person, and I really think it should be home-made but I suppose bought stuff will do (sometimes it just has to). Bring it to the boil with a smashed stalk of lemon grass or a couple of lime leaves and a couple of chopped red chillies, then let it simmer for a few minutes while you fry the meatballs. Drop them into a deep soup bowl, strain over the fragrant, piping-hot stock, then stir in some chopped mint leaves and some basil or coriander. And in a mild, consoling one If you have made the Euro-version with cheese and thyme, you can still turn the meatballs into a substantial soup-supper by using the same chicken broth but flavoured with lots of chopped, vivid green parsley instead of the lemon grass and chillies. A sponge pudding with its own sauce I believe passionately in the power of sweet, homely puddings to cure all manner of ills. Warm, nannying, becalming. Tucking into a dairy-rich hot pudding is, I am sure, the adult version of breastfeeding. To have some such pudding recipes to hand can prove endlessly useful, especially the good-natured ones like this, where a few grams either way matters less than is usual with baking. I am not sure you will want anything too sturdy to precede this, unless you are in the depths of winter. Enough for 6. 100g butter 175g caster sugar 1 lemon 2 medium-sized oranges 4 eggs 40g plain flour 400ml milk Cream the butter and sugar together until they are light and fluffy and the colour of finest double cream. It is easiest to do this is in a food mixer, though you could do it by hand if your butter is soft and you are feeling athletic. Set the oven at 180 C/Gas 4. Grate the zest from the lemon, making sure none of the bitter white pith comes with it, then cut the fruit in half and squeeze the juice. Do the same with the oranges. Separate the eggs and add the yolks to the creamed butter and sugar. The mixture will curdle but I wouldn't let it worry you. Now add the flour and milk alternately, the mixer on slow to medium, so you end up with a soft, cake-like batter. Stir in the orange and lemon zest and then the juice. Beat the egg whites to stiff peaks with an electric beater, then fold them carefully, so as not to knock out the air, into the batter. Scrape into a heatproof mixing bowl or souffl\u00e9 dish so that the mixture comes about halfway up the sides. Stand the basin in a roasting tin half-filled with hot water, then carefully transfer it to the oven. Bake for an hour or so, until the top is puffed and golden - press it with your finger to test; it should feel spongy - cool for five minutes before serving. And more... A lemon pudding Drop the oranges in favour of another two medium-sized lemons. If they are particularly juicy you may only need one. A chocolate pudding Into a large bowl put 150g self-raising flour, 2 tablespoons cocoa powder, 200g light soft brown sugar, 100g roughly chopped fine, dark chocolate, 200ml milk, a large knob of butter, melted, and a beaten egg. Mix well. Pour into a buttered pudding basin. Mix together 75g dark soft brown sugar, 75g golden caster sugar and 100g cocoa powder and scatter it on top. Pour in 400ml of almost boiling water. Put the pudding in a roasting tin of hot water and bake for 35-40 minutes at 180 C/Gas 4. A chocolate hazelnut pudding Add 50g finely chopped hazelnuts to the ingredients above. To serve The tartness of the lemon and orange puddings and the obscene richness of the chocolate version are cooled by the addition of double cream. Serve it by the jugful. The idea is that it merges lusciously with the pudding's intense, integral sauce. * \u0095 Visit www.nigelslater.co.uk - recipes are updated daily.",

      "body": "<p>My current favourite fantasy is that I buy a certain field, put back the hedges that once quartered it, then plant up the resulting four fields with apples. One of these little sheltered fields would be an orchard with cookers, another with dessert apples, another with dual-purpose trees, and the fourth would have cider apples. Each orchard would be about three acres big with around 100 trees, reaching a slow maturity with free trunks 6ft tall and spaced seven paces apart in each direction. Unlike a modern orchard, where the trees grow in stunted rows like swollen gooseberry bushes, these would be real trees, each capable of bearing hundreds of pounds of apples in maturity. It seems that this combination of the kind of large space that only a tiny handful of gardens can afford with the human proportion of a small field filled with apple trees growing as wide as they are high is the perfect summation of cultivated land. </p> <p>Of course, this doesn't fit with the trend for stunted trees for small gardens, or ballerina trees growing in pots less like ballerinas than Giacometti spinsters, or the honourable training of trees to fit confined spaces as espaliers, cordons or fans. All these things are fine, but none will do. Orchards are the real thing, the marvels in the garden. </p> <p>I had my first orchard in Hackney. I hardly knew what I was doing - which is a great advantage when it comes to getting things done - but made for a wasted opportunity. We grew six apple trees in our garden, although I can't remember which types they were, aside from the Egremont Russet. </p> <p>I don't think I was aware of rootstocks. Consequently, they were a mixed lot of various sizes, but I stuck them in the ground, staked them and they grew and bore lovely blossom, which, in the main, flourished into fruit. Daffodils grew around their base and a little lawn was held within their curtilage. It was a good place to be. No garden has a higher purpose than that. It is irrelevant what the place is composed of as long as it is a good place to be, with all the metaphysical and psychological concomitants of that. For most of us that amounts to a seat in a sunny spot or a bend in the path, but it is invariably the hub of the garden, the reason for it. </p> <p>If you have 20ft square, then you have the room for an orchard and this becomes a field full of trees, a hidden retreat and garden. The starting point is to choose the right rootstock. This is the important part of choosing an apple tree. The box describes what rootstocks are and how to choose a suitable one for your garden. It is not just trees of course. Apple trees without apples are unconsummated. And apples are not just fruit or pudding. They inspire devotion and obsession in the same way that wine or cheese do. I am the least collectable of men, but am bewitched by apples and apple trees. I'm writing this eating a Chivers Delight, a small, orange, twang of hard-edged sweetness, and would forgo all other fruit rather than apples. I line up our 36 varieties like a child with dinky toys, weigh them up in the hand, then sniff them. I possess them. </p> <p>So choose your varieties with care, and forget Cox's Orange Pippin. They are a nightmare to grow, being weedy, scabby, ugly trees that only sporadically bear fruit. When they do, the result is a dream, but you can do better. My current favourite is Ribston Pippin, but you must choose your own. </p> <p>Now is the perfect time to eat your way to your own ideal apple tree. There are more than 2,000 varieties you could grow and at least 100 of those are available from a range of nurserymen. So don't grow the banal stuff from the supermarket, and plant yourself a treat rather than a supply. If you have space for more than one variety, stretch the season out. The first apples, such as Discovery or Tydeman's Early or Worcester, will ripen in August, whereas Sturmer Pippin won't until November. But, if you want a spread of ripening times, you will also have a spread of blossom and, as no apple is reliably self-fertile, each tree will need a pollinator, so make sure that each tree is accompanied by another apple from the same group so that they can cross-pollinate each other. What this means in practise is that an Egremont Russet (group 2) is unlikely to cross-pollinate with King of the Pippins (group 5), but Ribston Pippin, Rev Wilkes and George Cave will all do fine in conjunction with it. Don't be neurotic about this as neighbouring groups tend to pollinate each other and a good rule of thumb is that if there is another apple tree within 100ft, in flower the same time as yours for at least three days, then you should get fruit. But not every year. Many apples are biennial, which in practise means they alternate between good and bad crops. Some fruit will be scabby and others have bitterpit, and the earwigs and wasps and moths will have their day. But that is an important part of their pomaceous charm. </p> <p> <strong> Rootstocks</strong> </p> <p> It is worth trying to understand rootstocks, because it is the controlling factor in the growth and eventual size of the tree. Every apple tree is grown by grafting a bud from the named variety, which will dictate the fruit that is produced, on to different roots chosen for the desired size and vigour of the mature tree. The reason for using rootstocks is that different apples have varying growth habits if attached to their own roots. Bramleys are vigorous, whereas Worcester Pearmain grows slowly and weedy. If you grew trees on their own roots it would be impossible to get suitable spacing. This is true if you grow apples from seed or cuttings, the variety is assured but the vigour unknowable. So the system has evolved where apples are grafted on to crab apple roots of known vigour. </p> <p>Until the First World War, trees were produced on 'paradise' stock, which was originally a dwarfing rootstock from France, but there was no control or classification. 'Paradise' stock from one nursery could be different from identically named rootstock from another supplier nearby. So the East Malling research station set about sorting out rootstocks. The first it produced was called Malling Type 1, which became shortened to M1. Eventually it got to M27, but only about 10 are used at all, and four are common. </p> <p>To confuse matters, another research station, the John Innes Horticultural Institution, based at Merton, also worked on rootstocks, collaborating with East Malling. The results of this work produced stocks that were named Malling Merton, or MM. So that they would not be confused with the M types, they were numbered from 100. Hence the rootstocks MM106 and MM111. </p> <p> <strong> Characteristics of common rootstocks:</strong> </p> <p> \u0095 M27 Very Dwarfing: ideal for containers, but needs rich soil and support through its life. </p> <p> \u0095 M9 Dwarfing: makes for a small tree that comes into bearing early, with early, large fruit. Has brittle roots, so needs permanent staking. Good for cordons and containers. </p> <p> \u0095 M26 Semi-dwarfing: used in commercial orchards because it produces early, large fruit. Tolerates poorer soil than M9, but is a slow starter. Needs permanent staking. </p> <p> \u0095 MM106 Semi-dwarfing: a medium tree that grows and crops well on poor soil. Suitable for semi-standards or large bush-shaped trees. Best for espalier or cordon trees in poor soils. </p> <p> \u0095 MM111 Vigorous: ideal for standard or semi-standard trees and is drought resistant. </p> <p> \u0095 M 25 Very Vigorous: suitable for large standards and produces up to 400lb of fruit. </p> <p>Plant bare-root and pot-grown trees alike into a generous hole, loosening the subsoil and adding some compost or manure. Stake the tree before planting and firm the roots in thoroughly. Water very well. Leave a wide area (at least a metre in diameter, preferably twice that) clear of growth and mulch it thickly with compost. I do not spray or treat my trees in any way other than to prune and thin at appropriate times. These are my top 10 garden dessert apples (followed by their pollinating groups in brackets): Ribston Pippin (2); Jupiter (3); Rosemary Russet (3); King of the Pippins (5); James Grieve (3); William Crump (5); Crimson Queening (3); Chivers Delight (4); Worcester Pearmain (3) and Ashmeads Kernel (4). </p> <p>While my favourite 10 culinary apples are: Devonshire Buckland (3); Arthur Turner (3); Herefordshire Beefing (4); Glory Of England (2); Reverent Wilkes (2); Newton Wonder (5); Bramley Seedling (3); Blenheim Orange (3); Peasgood Nonsuch (3); and Tom Putt (3).</p> <p><strong>My roots: A week in Monty's garden</strong></p> <p>I hurt my shoulder. I did it in August, drunkenly lifting weights at midnight. I know, it's pathetic. But there we are, the damage was done and the hurt remains. Only driving, writing with a pen or reaching for anything in bed hurts more than gardening. A couple of hours digging or planting guarantees a couple of days real discomfort. I find this depressing because it cuts out a whole tranche of life that provides happiness. The garden does not always need me, but it rams home how much I need the garden. I have always been an evangelist of muscular horticulture, digging and sweating for a personal victory. Now I potter, trying not to reach for anything with my right hand, in a constant little swamp of pain. This is often on my mind because I have been digging up all the ligularias in the Jewel garden and moving them to the new damp garden to join the hostas that I have also moved over the past few weeks.</p> <p>The 'new' damp garden has always been damp and has never been organised before, so now it is official. As with the hostas, the amazing thing was how much space the ligularias took once they were dug up and transplanted. I split the bigger clumps and left more space than they had been used to, but the transformation is dramatic. I moved them because we had found that even in the heavy soil of the Jewel garden, they only looked happy in wet weather. A day or two without rain and they would wilt and flop. In turn, this has left spaces to be filled in the Jewel garden, but a space is not a loss but an opportunity. Mainly to thin out and redistribute the various grasses that we planted far too close together to get an instant effect for last summer's American magazine that came to do a feature on the garden. </p> <p>We have had a couple of light frosts, but not enough to damage anything other than the basil and not enough to kill off the caterpillars on the brassica. I find that they always start on the green plants, like broccoli, and then move on to the purple plants like curly kale and red cabbage. I am still picking off dozens from these plants which we grow as much for aesthetic as nourishment. But it has been a good season for rocket, all of which I have grown in soil blocks for the first year and planted out, rather than sowing in rows and then thinning. But it seems to be hotter than normal. Is this the weather or the seed? By the way, I like getting email from you, (<a href=\"mailto:montydon@btclick.com\">montydon@btclick.com</a>).</p>",

These are my top 10 garden dessert apples (followed by their pollinating groups in brackets): Ribston Pippin (2); Jupiter (3); Rosemary Russet (3); King of the Pippins (5); James Grieve (3); William Crump (5); Crimson Queening (3); Chivers Delight (4); Worcester Pearmain (3) and Ashmeads Kernel (4). While my favourite 10 culinary apples are: Devonshire Buckland (3); Arthur Turner (3); Herefordshire Beefing (4); Glory Of England (2); Reverent Wilkes (2); Newton Wonder (5); Bramley Seedling (3); Blenheim Orange (3); Peasgood Nonsuch (3); and Tom Putt (3). My roots: A week in Monty's garden I hurt my shoulder. I did it in August, drunkenly lifting weights at midnight. I know, it's pathetic. But there we are, the damage was done and the hurt remains. Only driving, writing with a pen or reaching for anything in bed hurts more than gardening. A couple of hours digging or planting guarantees a couple of days real discomfort. I find this depressing because it cuts out a whole tranche of life that provides happiness. The garden does not always need me, but it rams home how much I need the garden. I have always been an evangelist of muscular horticulture, digging and sweating for a personal victory. Now I potter, trying not to reach for anything with my right hand, in a constant little swamp of pain. This is often on my mind because I have been digging up all the ligularias in the Jewel garden and moving them to the new damp garden to join the hostas that I have also moved over the past few weeks. The 'new' damp garden has always been damp and has never been organised before, so now it is official. As with the hostas, the amazing thing was how much space the ligularias took once they were dug up and transplanted. I split the bigger clumps and left more space than they had been used to, but the transformation is dramatic. I moved them because we had found that even in the heavy soil of the Jewel garden, they only looked happy in wet weather. A day or two without rain and they would wilt and flop. In turn, this has left spaces to be filled in the Jewel garden, but a space is not a loss but an opportunity. Mainly to thin out and redistribute the various grasses that we planted far too close together to get an instant effect for last summer's American magazine that came to do a feature on the garden. We have had a couple of light frosts, but not enough to damage anything other than the basil and not enough to kill off the caterpillars on the brassica. I find that they always start on the green plants, like broccoli, and then move on to the purple plants like curly kale and red cabbage. I am still picking off dozens from these plants which we grow as much for aesthetic as nourishment. But it has been a good season for rocket, all of which I have grown in soil blocks for the first year and planted out, rather than sowing in rows and then thinning. But it seems to be hotter than normal. Is this the weather or the seed? By the way, I like getting email from you, (montydon@btclick.com).",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair moved yesterday to dampen expectations of a multi-million pound climbdown on fuel tax in next week's pre-Budget report. With the Chancellor under heavy pressure to slash the duty on petrol and motoring costs following the blockade of fuel depots, the Prime Minister said any measures taken would have to be carefully controlled. He was immediately accused by the Tories of a 'cynical' attempt to lower expectations so that the Government's eventual proposals will look generous by comparison. But Blair's comments, made during the visit to his Spanish counterpart Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar, will relieve some of the pressure on the Treasury, following repeated reports that Downing Street was pushing a reluctant Brown to appease motorists as well as pensioners who are demanding a rise in the basic state pension. The Prime Minister said the Government must ensure that any attempts to offset high prices at the petrol pumps 'does not have an adverse effect on mortgages or interest rates, because that wouldn't be of help to ordinary families'. The costs of fuel to drivers 'were caused primarily by the rise in oil prices' affecting most of the industrialised world, he added. That will be seen as a signal that the widely expected olive branch for motorists will be strictly targeted and may focus on issues such as raising barriers to entry into the haulier business or cutting road tax, rather than on tax cuts. However, Tory transport spokesman Bernard Jenkin accused the Prime Minister of a 'cynical attempt to reduce people's expectations'. He added: 'Anything less than a substantial cut in fuel duty will be a further betrayal of their tax promises.'

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Early last year I began training for one of the few polar challenges still to be achieved: an attempt to reach the North Pole solo and unsupported by the direct route from the Arctic coastline of North America. </p> <p>I estimated it would take 85 days. For safety I would carry 90 days' food. This alone would weigh more than 230lb, with fuel to melt ice to rehydrate it coming to another 60lb. All additional gear - tent, sleeping bag, mat, cooking kit, rope, axe, shovel, grapnel hook, spare ski, spare clothes, repair kit, medical kit, camera, shotgun, lithium batteries, fluorescent marker poles, paddle - would total another 220lb; too much for a single sledge travelling in Arctic rubble ice, so I had to use two sledges. </p> <p>This meant every mile gained to the north would involve three travelled on the ground. A one-sledge trip is dangerous enough, in that blizzards and white-outs are common. Perspective is wiped out and ski tracks become invisible. You are in a world of cotton wool, or white night, able to see only your own body: all else is a grey-white blur. In such conditions the need to relay sledges involves a potentially lethal risk - once you have parked the first sledge and set off for your second load, you may never find it. At some point you will decide, because of the cold, to return to the first sledge. But it, too, may be impossible to find. You will then die. </p> <p>My schedule took the extra mileage into account. If I could travel north for 10 hours every day for 80 days, with no rest day for injuries, bad weather or watery obstacles, my best progress would be 500 yards a day for the first three days, 1.4 miles daily for the next 30 days, 4.5 miles daily until day 58 and then, with a single sledge only, 11 miles daily to the Pole. </p> <p>On 14 February I flew to the most northerly of Canada's meteorological stations, at Eureka, where musk oxen and wolves roam the hills around the airstrip. After refuelling, my friend Karl Z'berg piloted the Twin Otter 100 miles further north to the north end of Ward Hunt Island, the starting point of most North Pole attempts. With lurching bumps, we were down. As the door opened, I felt the bitter cold. The sun would not show its face here for three more weeks, and then only for 30 minutes a day. I would travel by moonlight and head torch. When the ski-plane had gone, I took a bearing to geographical north. I could not use the North Star because it was almost directly overhead. </p> <p>The clothing policy I had evolved over 28 years of polar expeditions was based on non-stop movement and light, breathable clothes. Any halt, however brief, could lead to hypothermia. Once my metabolism was up and running, pumping blood furiously to my extremities, I took off my duck-down duvet and stuffed it in the sledge next to my vacuum flask and shotgun. Now I was wearing only a thin wickaway vest and long johns under a black jacket and trousers made of 100 per cent Ventile cotton. Cotton is not windproof so body heat is not sealed in. Alas, no modern material is completely breathable so, when pulling excessive loads over difficult terrain, you perspire. The sweat turns to ice inside the clothing and can quickly lead to hypothermia. Cotton is still the best compromise. </p> <p>My schedule allowed two days to reach the edge of the sea. But I kept going without a rest and established both sledges at the coastline within seven hours. This boded well, for the sledges were running easily despite their full loads, the low temperature and soft, deep snow. </p> <p>After seven hours of hard man-hauling, I was cold and tired. I erected the tent in six minutes and started the cooker in four. These two acts, which I had practised thousands of times, are the key to survival, and with two usable hands can be performed easily in extreme temperatures, high winds and blizzards. I got into my sleeping bag, drank some energy drink, ate chocolate and set my alarm watch for three hours. </p> <p>The weather was clear when I woke and the sea ice quiet to the north, a sign that the ice floes were not on the move. The moon had vanished behind the hills, meaning I would not be able to differentiate between solid ice and thinly skinned zones, so the ice-silence indicating static floes was a bonus. </p> <p>Over the past 15 years with Mike Stroud, I had three times broken the current world record for unsupported travel to the North Pole. Each time the ice conditions north of Ward Hunt Island were invariably horrible. I saw that this year the walls and rubble were split everywhere by recent breakage. My schedule of 500 yards a day for the first three miles began to look optimistic. </p> <p>I pressed on over the fissure dividing land from sea and into a broad belt of rubble. I took my skis off. For a few hundred yards I would have to haul each sledge over a vista similar to that of postwar Berlin. Between each ice slab, deep snow covered the fissures. I often fell into traps, sinking waist deep. </p> <p>I came to a wall of slabs 15ft high and decided to test the simple pulley system devised by my base leader, 'Mac' Mackenney. I attached it to the big sledge and tugged it jerkily up the 45-degree slope to the top. Too late I heard movement, and leapt towards the sledge which quickly gathered momentum in its slide over the edge of the wall. I managed to grab the rear end, but my body weight was not enough. The far side of the wall was a sheer 15ft drop on to sharp ice blocks. I landed hard. I was winded but unhurt. </p> <p>At first the sledge looked undamaged, but closer inspection revealed a 16in tear under the bow. The floatability of the sledge's hull, designed to be completely watertight, was compromised. There was no alternative but to head back to the hut on Ward Hunt Island and find substitute materials to effect a repair. </p> <p>In the mid Eighties we had erected a canvas cover over the steel skeleton of a hut long abandoned by scientists and installed a couple of wind-powered generators to provide electricity. With minimal safety gear in a bag, I skied for two hours back up my own outward trail and then headed east along the base of the mountain. The old huts looked like a ghost camp, unchanged over the 12 years since my last visit. </p> <p>After an hour spent digging out the door of our old hut, I gained entry. There were a few tools and canvas materials, so I decided to bring the sledge back to make it watertight. I skied back to the sledges and loaded minimal camping gear on to the smaller one. Then I lashed the damaged sledge on top. Uphill through soft snow was slow going, some seven hours back to the hut. </p> <p>I put my tent up inside the hut. The temperature outside had fallen to minus 49 degrees C. With the cooker on, a hot drink inside me and fully clothed, I began the repairs. Some hours later I was back at the ice edge. </p> <p>I camped on thin ice but woke to hear all manner of noises: cracking and rumbling, then silence. Then, a nearby and frightening roar that galvanised me into movement from the depths of my sleeping bag. The moon was full, the scenery startlingly beautiful. Moonshadows played about the upended ice blocks and the ice shapes took on an uncanny resemblance to animals, castles or giant mushrooms. </p> <p>I pressed on northwards. I dared not take either sledge too far, because the surface between the rubble fields consisted of very thin ice through which my probing ski-stick passed with ease into the waters below. After eight hours I had moved both sledges more than a mile to the north. My morale was high as I was making good progress. I ate a chocolate bar every two hours to ward off hypothermia, but was beginning to tire so I decided to camp on any flat surface that looked solid. I came to a zone of interlacing fractures. The moon had vanished, but whenever I stopped I heard the grumble of ice on the move. To avoid a trench of black water, I mounted a bridge of foot-thick slabs, buckled by floe pressure. I had the small sledge with me and the big one 500 yards to the south. I clambered over the slabs with my skis on. The sledge followed easily in my wake. </p> <p> There was no warning. A slab tilted under the sledge, which pulled me backwards. I fell on my back and slid down the slab. The noise that followed was the one I most hate to hear in the Arctic - a splash. The sledge was in the sea. </p> <p>I kicked out with my skis and flailed at the slab with both hands. One ski boot plunged into the sea and one gloved hand found an edge of a static slab. Taking a firm grip, I pulled my wet foot and ski out of the water and managed to unfasten my harness. I was already beginning to shiver. I squirmed around until I could sit on a flatter slab to inspect the sledge in the gloom. </p> <p>It was under water, but not sinking. Seventy days' worth of food and 30 of fuel were on that sledge - and the communications gear: without it the expedition was over. A nearby slab crashed into the sea: the ice was moving. I had to save the sledge quickly. Soon I would be dangerously cold. </p> <p>I pushed up my jacket sleeve and took off my outer mitt. In retrospect I may have been better off keeping it on, but I had to feel for the submerged rope. For a minute or so I could not find the snag. Then, by jiggling the rope sharply, it came free. I pulled hard and the sledge rose to the surface. My wet hand was numb, but I could not replace the mitt until the sledge was out of the sea. Gradually the prow rose on to a slab and water cascaded off its canvas cover. Minutes later the sledge was on 'dry land'. I danced about like a madman. Both my mitts were back on and I used my 'cold hands revival technique' to restore life to the numb fingers. This involves a fast windmill motion with the fingers. Usually the blood returns painfully to all my fingers: this time it did not. I took off the mitt. </p> <p>My fingers were ramrod stiff and ivory white. They might as well have been wooden. I knew that if I let my good hand go even partially numb, I would be unable to erect the tent and start the cooker, which I needed to do quickly for I was shivering. </p> <p>I returned to the big sledge. The next 30 minutes were a nightmare. The sledge-cover zip jammed. Precious minutes went by before I could free it and start erecting the tent. My teeth were chattering violently and my good hand was numb. I had to get the cooker going in minutes or it would be too late. I crawled into the partially erect tent, closed its door-zip and began a 20-minute battle to start the cooker. </p> <p>I could not use the petrol lighter with my fingers, but I found some matches I could hold in my teeth. Starting an extremely cold petrol cooker involves careful priming so that just the right amount of fuel seeps into the pad below the fuel jet. Using my teeth and a numb index finger, I finally worked the pump enough to squirt fuel on to the pad, but was slow in shutting the valve: when I applied the match a three-foot flame reached to the roof. Luckily I'd had a flame lining installed, so the tent was undamaged. And the cooker was alight - one of the best moments of my life. </p> <p>Slowly and painfully some life came back into the fingers of my good hand.

      "bodyText": "Early last year I began training for one of the few polar challenges still to be achieved: an attempt to reach the North Pole solo and unsupported by the direct route from the Arctic coastline of North America. I estimated it would take 85 days. For safety I would carry 90 days' food. This alone would weigh more than 230lb, with fuel to melt ice to rehydrate it coming to another 60lb. All additional gear - tent, sleeping bag, mat, cooking kit, rope, axe, shovel, grapnel hook, spare ski, spare clothes, repair kit, medical kit, camera, shotgun, lithium batteries, fluorescent marker poles, paddle - would total another 220lb; too much for a single sledge travelling in Arctic rubble ice, so I had to use two sledges. This meant every mile gained to the north would involve three travelled on the ground. A one-sledge trip is dangerous enough, in that blizzards and white-outs are common. Perspective is wiped out and ski tracks become invisible. You are in a world of cotton wool, or white night, able to see only your own body: all else is a grey-white blur. In such conditions the need to relay sledges involves a potentially lethal risk - once you have parked the first sledge and set off for your second load, you may never find it. At some point you will decide, because of the cold, to return to the first sledge. But it, too, may be impossible to find. You will then die. My schedule took the extra mileage into account. If I could travel north for 10 hours every day for 80 days, with no rest day for injuries, bad weather or watery obstacles, my best progress would be 500 yards a day for the first three days, 1.4 miles daily for the next 30 days, 4.5 miles daily until day 58 and then, with a single sledge only, 11 miles daily to the Pole. On 14 February I flew to the most northerly of Canada's meteorological stations, at Eureka, where musk oxen and wolves roam the hills around the airstrip. After refuelling, my friend Karl Z'berg piloted the Twin Otter 100 miles further north to the north end of Ward Hunt Island, the starting point of most North Pole attempts. With lurching bumps, we were down. As the door opened, I felt the bitter cold. The sun would not show its face here for three more weeks, and then only for 30 minutes a day. I would travel by moonlight and head torch. When the ski-plane had gone, I took a bearing to geographical north. I could not use the North Star because it was almost directly overhead. The clothing policy I had evolved over 28 years of polar expeditions was based on non-stop movement and light, breathable clothes. Any halt, however brief, could lead to hypothermia. Once my metabolism was up and running, pumping blood furiously to my extremities, I took off my duck-down duvet and stuffed it in the sledge next to my vacuum flask and shotgun. Now I was wearing only a thin wickaway vest and long johns under a black jacket and trousers made of 100 per cent Ventile cotton. Cotton is not windproof so body heat is not sealed in. Alas, no modern material is completely breathable so, when pulling excessive loads over difficult terrain, you perspire. The sweat turns to ice inside the clothing and can quickly lead to hypothermia. Cotton is still the best compromise. My schedule allowed two days to reach the edge of the sea. But I kept going without a rest and established both sledges at the coastline within seven hours. This boded well, for the sledges were running easily despite their full loads, the low temperature and soft, deep snow. After seven hours of hard man-hauling, I was cold and tired. I erected the tent in six minutes and started the cooker in four. These two acts, which I had practised thousands of times, are the key to survival, and with two usable hands can be performed easily in extreme temperatures, high winds and blizzards. I got into my sleeping bag, drank some energy drink, ate chocolate and set my alarm watch for three hours. The weather was clear when I woke and the sea ice quiet to the north, a sign that the ice floes were not on the move. The moon had vanished behind the hills, meaning I would not be able to differentiate between solid ice and thinly skinned zones, so the ice-silence indicating static floes was a bonus. Over the past 15 years with Mike Stroud, I had three times broken the current world record for unsupported travel to the North Pole. Each time the ice conditions north of Ward Hunt Island were invariably horrible. I saw that this year the walls and rubble were split everywhere by recent breakage. My schedule of 500 yards a day for the first three miles began to look optimistic. I pressed on over the fissure dividing land from sea and into a broad belt of rubble. I took my skis off. For a few hundred yards I would have to haul each sledge over a vista similar to that of postwar Berlin. Between each ice slab, deep snow covered the fissures. I often fell into traps, sinking waist deep. I came to a wall of slabs 15ft high and decided to test the simple pulley system devised by my base leader, 'Mac' Mackenney. I attached it to the big sledge and tugged it jerkily up the 45-degree slope to the top. Too late I heard movement, and leapt towards the sledge which quickly gathered momentum in its slide over the edge of the wall. I managed to grab the rear end, but my body weight was not enough. The far side of the wall was a sheer 15ft drop on to sharp ice blocks. I landed hard. I was winded but unhurt. At first the sledge looked undamaged, but closer inspection revealed a 16in tear under the bow. The floatability of the sledge's hull, designed to be completely watertight, was compromised. There was no alternative but to head back to the hut on Ward Hunt Island and find substitute materials to effect a repair. In the mid Eighties we had erected a canvas cover over the steel skeleton of a hut long abandoned by scientists and installed a couple of wind-powered generators to provide electricity. With minimal safety gear in a bag, I skied for two hours back up my own outward trail and then headed east along the base of the mountain. The old huts looked like a ghost camp, unchanged over the 12 years since my last visit. After an hour spent digging out the door of our old hut, I gained entry. There were a few tools and canvas materials, so I decided to bring the sledge back to make it watertight. I skied back to the sledges and loaded minimal camping gear on to the smaller one. Then I lashed the damaged sledge on top. Uphill through soft snow was slow going, some seven hours back to the hut. I put my tent up inside the hut. The temperature outside had fallen to minus 49 degrees C. With the cooker on, a hot drink inside me and fully clothed, I began the repairs. Some hours later I was back at the ice edge. I camped on thin ice but woke to hear all manner of noises: cracking and rumbling, then silence. Then, a nearby and frightening roar that galvanised me into movement from the depths of my sleeping bag. The moon was full, the scenery startlingly beautiful. Moonshadows played about the upended ice blocks and the ice shapes took on an uncanny resemblance to animals, castles or giant mushrooms. I pressed on northwards. I dared not take either sledge too far, because the surface between the rubble fields consisted of very thin ice through which my probing ski-stick passed with ease into the waters below. After eight hours I had moved both sledges more than a mile to the north. My morale was high as I was making good progress. I ate a chocolate bar every two hours to ward off hypothermia, but was beginning to tire so I decided to camp on any flat surface that looked solid. I came to a zone of interlacing fractures. The moon had vanished, but whenever I stopped I heard the grumble of ice on the move. To avoid a trench of black water, I mounted a bridge of foot-thick slabs, buckled by floe pressure. I had the small sledge with me and the big one 500 yards to the south. I clambered over the slabs with my skis on. The sledge followed easily in my wake. There was no warning. A slab tilted under the sledge, which pulled me backwards. I fell on my back and slid down the slab. The noise that followed was the one I most hate to hear in the Arctic - a splash. The sledge was in the sea. I kicked out with my skis and flailed at the slab with both hands. One ski boot plunged into the sea and one gloved hand found an edge of a static slab. Taking a firm grip, I pulled my wet foot and ski out of the water and managed to unfasten my harness. I was already beginning to shiver. I squirmed around until I could sit on a flatter slab to inspect the sledge in the gloom. It was under water, but not sinking. Seventy days' worth of food and 30 of fuel were on that sledge - and the communications gear: without it the expedition was over. A nearby slab crashed into the sea: the ice was moving. I had to save the sledge quickly. Soon I would be dangerously cold. I pushed up my jacket sleeve and took off my outer mitt. In retrospect I may have been better off keeping it on, but I had to feel for the submerged rope. For a minute or so I could not find the snag. Then, by jiggling the rope sharply, it came free. I pulled hard and the sledge rose to the surface. My wet hand was numb, but I could not replace the mitt until the sledge was out of the sea. Gradually the prow rose on to a slab and water cascaded off its canvas cover. Minutes later the sledge was on 'dry land'. I danced about like a madman. Both my mitts were back on and I used my 'cold hands revival technique' to restore life to the numb fingers. This involves a fast windmill motion with the fingers. Usually the blood returns painfully to all my fingers: this time it did not. I took off the mitt. My fingers were ramrod stiff and ivory white. They might as well have been wooden. I knew that if I let my good hand go even partially numb, I would be unable to erect the tent and start the cooker, which I needed to do quickly for I was shivering. I returned to the big sledge. The next 30 minutes were a nightmare. The sledge-cover zip jammed. Precious minutes went by before I could free it and start erecting the tent. My teeth were chattering violently and my good hand was numb. I had to get the cooker going in minutes or it would be too late. I crawled into the partially erect tent, closed its door-zip and began a 20-minute battle to start the cooker. I could not use the petrol lighter with my fingers, but I found some matches I could hold in my teeth. Starting an extremely cold petrol cooker involves careful priming so that just the right amount of fuel seeps into the pad below the fuel jet. Using my teeth and a numb index finger, I finally worked the pump enough to squirt fuel on to the pad, but was slow in shutting the valve: when I applied the match a three-foot flame reached to the roof. Luckily I'd had a flame lining installed, so the tent was undamaged. And the cooker was alight - one of the best moments of my life. Slowly and painfully some life came back into the fingers of my good hand. An hour later, with my body warm again, I unlaced my wet boot. Only two toes had been affected. Soon they would exhibit big blood blisters and lose their nails, but they had escaped frostbite. I was in no doubt as to the fate of my bad hand. I had seen enough frostbite to realise I was in trouble. I had to get to a hospital quickly to save some fingers. I set out in great trepidation. Five hours later I was back on the ice shelf. I erected the tent properly and spent three hours massaging my good hand and wet foot over the cooker. From there, the journey to the hut took for ever.
