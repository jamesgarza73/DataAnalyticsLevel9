But with conductor Christoph von Dohnanyi and the Cleveland Orchestra, a cast of soloists like Bryn Terfel, Jennifer Larmore and Vinson Cole, and a small army of singers, it proved a suitably stunning curtain-raiser for the international festival - and a star-studded christening for the newly refurbished Usher Hall. </p> <p>Inspired by Goethe's definitive romantic tragedy, Berlioz's invention in La Damnation encompasses everything from celestial choirs to drunken mobs and bloodthirsty demons. Although designed as a concert work, the piece is really an opera for the imagination. The unearthly colours that Berlioz draws from his huge orchestral resources and massed ranks of choirs are as vividly theatrical as any 19th-century horror opera. Yet somehow the oratorio format makes the work seem even more dramatic than it would be in the theatre. In passages like the final Pandemonium, with its chorus of the damned singing in an unknown tongue, and the Princes of Darkness ruled by Mephistopheles' diabolical magic, Berlioz's score completely transcends its function as a purely musical concert piece. Instead, the music's immediacy is an assault on all the senses, suggesting a kaleidoscope of images that would be impossible to realise on the stage. </p> <p>But the score needs more than mere brute force if Berlioz's visions of mortal and immortal life are to jump off the page as they should. Von Dohnanyi has been superbly convincing in realising the fantasy of Berlioz's orchestration, yet making individual scenes serve the ends of the whole drama. For all that the concluding Ride to the Abyss had a glorious, twisted grandeur, it also provided a dramatic contrast to the pastoral reverie of the earlier Dance of the Sylphes. The special magnificence of the Cleveland Orchestra's woodwind section brought to life the otherworldly choreography of Berlioz's filigree spirits. </p> <p>At the centre of the performance was Vinson Cole's Faust. Unencumbered by a score, he was by turns an innocent fool and selfish, helpless oaf, tormented by Mephistopheles' relentless pursuit of his soul. Cole caught Faust's world-weariness especially successfully in the first part, perfectly portraying Berlioz's conception of the philosophical and narcissistic side of his anti-hero. </p> <p>Bryn Terfel was magnetic as Mephistopheles. From his first entry, accompanied by a spectral crash of cymbals and shimmering strings, Terfel's presence commanded the stage just as his Mephistopheles led Faust inexorably to his doom. Terfel was the ideal vocal foil for Cole's Faust. Where Cole emphasised the languorous lyricism of his part, Terfel was chillingly assertive and uncompromising, even in the deft virtuosity of the Song of the Flea. </p> <p>Neal Davies made for a jovial Brander; Jennifer Larmore's Marguerite, however, was less sharply focused than the other solo roles, even if her set pieces in the third part were beguiling. But choruses from Cleveland and Edinburgh, along with the RSNO Junior Chorus, were mightily impressive in their roles as peasants, students and spirits, ensuring the supernatural success of Berlioz's epic.</p>",

He is seeking donations from policyholders as well as from larger investors.

What he appears to want is to secure the conversion of Standard Life into a PLC, unlocking windfalls he estimated could average almost \u00a38,000. </p> <p>The 50-year-old father of two can already claim one scalp in the form of <strong>Friends Provident</strong>, Britain's third largest mutual life insurer, which announced in May that it intends to convert to a PLC, days after coming under attack from Mr Hart's <strong> Friends Provident Vote Campaign</strong> group. Another of his targets, <strong> Scottish Provident</strong>, has agreed to review its mutual status after being targeted by another of the groups he leads, the <strong> Scottish Provident Members Alliance Group</strong>. </p> <p>Mr Hart, of Hamilton, who is a director of a telecoms company, denies he is a carpetbagger - Members' Rights Campaign is, he says, a group \"for all mutual members who believe in democracy and truth\".

Mr Hart is chairman of the internet-based Members' Rights Campaign, a group claiming to fight for the rights of policyholders of mutual financial institutions and \"find out what the members really want\". What he appears to want is to secure the conversion of Standard Life into a PLC, unlocking windfalls he estimated could average almost \u00a38,000. The 50-year-old father of two can already claim one scalp in the form of Friends Provident, Britain's third largest mutual life insurer, which announced in May that it intends to convert to a PLC, days after coming under attack from Mr Hart's Friends Provident Vote Campaign group. Another of his targets, Scottish Provident, has agreed to review its mutual status after being targeted by another of the groups he leads, the Scottish Provident Members Alliance Group. Mr Hart, of Hamilton, who is a director of a telecoms company, denies he is a carpetbagger - Members' Rights Campaign is, he says, a group \"for all mutual members who believe in democracy and truth\". He says he is no speculator, having been a Standard Life policyholder for two decades.

The most spectacular showcase for this wealth of upcoming talent was Saturday's double-decker event, which brought together all of the country's national youth-music ensembles as part of the UK-wide Millennium Festival.

Having said that, to have a good argument, you would have to have convincing reasons as to why you deserve a salary at the higher band. Normally, when a salary band is advertised in a recruitment advert, the more a candidate fits the person specification, the higher they can expect their salary to be within the offered band.

You will need to explain that you fit the person specification perfectly, or that you excel in a particular area: for example, you have more experience than they require, or higher qualifications. If you are convinced that you deserve to start right at the top range, go for it and ask for \u00a320,000. Chances are, they will compromise and offer you \u00a319,000.</p> <p>Remember, you are in the best position to ask for a pay-rise since they have openly indicated a confidence in your ability to do the job - if they weren't convinced they wouldn't have offered it you.

Customers will be able to choose from over 3,500 models by picking up a leaflet and placing an order by phone. </p> <p>The food retailer claims the main benefits are not having to deal with car salesmen and a special financing package being run through Sainbury's Bank, a joint venture between the stores group and the Bank of Scotland. </p> <p>Cars are sold under two- or three-year agreements with customers being able to choose at the end of that period whether to pay off the remaining sum or return the car. </p> <p>Customers can put down a \u00a3215 deposit and pay from \u00a3152 a month. A Peugeot 206 hatchback 1.1L would cost \u00a310,827.74 to buy after three years using an annual percentage borrowing rate of 10.9%. </p> <p>Sainsbury claims to be the first supermarket group to enter the car market but Tesco said it too had been weighing up the advantages.

      "bodyText": "A supermarket war over cars looked poised to break out last night after Sainsbury introduced a scheme to sell new vehicles and Tesco said it was considering a similar plan. Sainsbury is taking its car sales to all its stores after a successful pilot scheme in Scotland and the north of England. Customers will be able to choose from over 3,500 models by picking up a leaflet and placing an order by phone. The food retailer claims the main benefits are not having to deal with car salesmen and a special financing package being run through Sainbury's Bank, a joint venture between the stores group and the Bank of Scotland. Cars are sold under two- or three-year agreements with customers being able to choose at the end of that period whether to pay off the remaining sum or return the car. Customers can put down a \u00a3215 deposit and pay from \u00a3152 a month. A Peugeot 206 hatchback 1.1L would cost \u00a310,827.74 to buy after three years using an annual percentage borrowing rate of 10.9%. Sainsbury claims to be the first supermarket group to enter the car market but Tesco said it too had been weighing up the advantages. Like Sainsbury, Tesco has moved from food retailing into the sale of petrol and banking services. A spokeswoman said: \"We have been looking at the market for over a year and are seriously considering selling cars.\"",

Using influences as diverse as the Small Faces and Royal Trux, the Rolling Stones and the MC5, they are the Spencer Davis Group as covered by Nirvana, tight Hammond sounds fused with raw, ear-bleeding power, just as likely to make you go out and smash something as they are to get you dancing.

As Mark Boyce makes his keyboards wail and pushes them dangerously towards the front of the stage, Foreman abandons his guitar, jumps off the stage and sings in a gruff, dark voice, surrounded by the crowd. Climbing on to the shoulders of a by-stander, eyes closed, he carries on singing, until his weary carrier finally throws him back on to the stage. Before you know it, he's leading us into a \"soul clap\". This is late 60s soul, US punk style with a touch of old school showbiz thrown in. </p> <p>It's just a pity that while the performance is original, the music is a bit secondhand. While Jason Kourkounis's ragged, soaring guitars, Adam Cothren's percussion and the heavy bass of Bruce Reckahn Jnr are a heady, thumping slice of rock, the Delta 72 are too enamoured of the past to let go of it completely. Each song is sweetly dedicated to a legend - from Ronnie Lane to Booker T and the MGs - and the songs are peppered with recognisable riffs that skip into each other like a scratch CD of Great Rock Moments. But as I Feel Fine and Why Is Not an Answer see the wah-wah guitars smudging and screeching all over the place, sounding fantastic as the sweat drips down the walls of the Wag, we've all been converted. </p>",

A small cast takes parts in each time frame - daughters become mothers, sons become fathers - underlining the play's fascination with fate and the way genetics and destiny might mix to make a life. This works well, drawing the audience into the puzzle of loose ends and clues that a pathologist throws out from the body of evidence before him - a baby an elderly woman doesn't want to talk about, a genetic defect we see the tragic results of long before we know the cause. He does this from high up, towering above the players, scrubbed up in front of a blinding white backdrop. It's like the blank sheet we all start with, and the light at the end of the tunnel of life we're all chaotically heading for. Both of these - the blank beginning and the last light - and everything in between, McCartney dramatises with an emotional precision that will take your breath away. Till August 26.

Labour is on course to lift about 1.2m children and 800,000 adults out of poverty by April 2002. All families will have gained (by almost \u00a3850 a year) but poor families will have gained most of all (about \u00a31,500). This is the biggest lift for poor children since the welfare state was launched in 1948, but there will still be more than twice as many children living in poverty at the end of this parliament as there were in 1979, last year of the last Labour government.</p> <p>Labour already has an ambitious 20-year welfare goal, set out by the prime minister in a public address in 1999: \"Our historic aim will be for ours to be the first generation to end child poverty. It is a 20-year mission,\" and a 10-year target was subsequently set by the chancellor, Gordon Brown, of halving child poverty by 2009.</p> <p>Child poverty (children living in households below half average income) increased threefold in the three decades up to 1997 - from 1.4m in 1968 to 4.4m in 1997, or one out of three of all children. This was the third worst rate of child poverty in the developed world.</p> <p>The targets were also politically clever. Labour wanted to restore public support for the welfare system. What better client group to rally such support than children?</p> <p>The chancellor has promised that his new integrated child credit, which will bring together the different strands of support for children except child benefit, will lift a further 1m children out of poverty when it is introduced in 2003. Excellent, but Labour should provide the figures and a date for the next million after that.</p> <p>What should happen now?</p> <p><b> Help for poorest: </b> The most disadvantaged group in the first term has been people without work or children. These people - disabled, unemployed, chronically sick - have watched others being lifted up while their benefits have only been linked to prices.</p> <p>Without an earnings link, a further 300,000 people in this group will fall below the poverty line. If Labour is to honour the second half of its manifesto mantra (\"work for those who can, security for those who can't\"), their benefits must be earnings linked. Indeed, given how far benefits have fallen below minimum living standards, the index should be 1% above earnings to help them begin to catch up.</p> <p><b> Pensioners: </b> The second poorest people are the elderly who only have the basic pension to live on. Labour has been right to concentrate its extra resources on these 500,000 people but should have made more determined efforts to find out who they are. Some 7m of the 10.8m pensioners are now drawing an occupational or personal pension. In a society in which 2% of pensioners now pay the top tax rate, it is wrong to make an across-the-board increase.</p> <p>At present, poor single pensioners receive between \u00a311 and \u00a318.55 extra a week (according to age) through Labour's minimum income guarantee (MIG) on top of the \u00a367.50 basic pension. Poor couples receive between \u00a317.45 and \u00a326.55 extra on top of the basic (\u00a3107.90). But since the Thatcher government cut the basic pension's link with earnings in 1981, single pensioners have lost \u00a330 a week and couples \u00a348. A radical government would restore this loss to the poorest pensioners by lifting MIG to the equivalent figure. This will create problems by lifting the poorest pensioners above pensioners who have some savings, but this could be solved by a pension credit so small savers are not penalised.</p> <p><b> Social Fund:</b> The fund was set up to provide grants to poor people needing cash for exceptional items - from pots and pans which wear out, to cookers that have to be replaced. People living on benefits have no savings to which they can turn in emergencies. An offer of a better but unfurnished flat can only be accepted if there is help with bedding and second-hand furniture. But in 1988 the Conservatives changed the rules, making the fund a predominantly loan issuing body - 1.8m loans compared to 225,000 grants in 1998/99. Labour condemned the move in 1988 and its national commission on social justice in 1994 described the fund as \"perhaps the most soul-destroying aspect of income support\". The grant system should be restored. It would cost less than 0.4% of the social security budget.</p> <p><b> Sure Start:</b> This is one of the most imaginative Labour schemes - offering support to parents of poor children through a variety of different schemes - but even after the expansion announced in the July comprehensive spending review, it only reaches one third of poor homes with children.

      "body": "<p>If you have friends who work in the university world, chances are they have been acting rather strangely over the last few months. Looking abstracted; muttering angrily to themselves; tearing out their hair. Another RAE - research assessment exercise - is coming up. </p> <p>The scheme came into existence a decade ago. What happens is that every four years, each university department the length and breadth of Britain is required to list the scholarship it has produced since the last RAE. Every member of the department is expected to come up with four items - ideally four books if you're a humanist, four better mousetraps if you're a scientist. The lists have to be in by this December. </p> <p>On the basis of the submission, an external panel grades the departments, creating gigantic sets of league tables out of the country's 110 or so universities. These are published next April, when the hair-tearing will begin again. </p> <p>Grades run on a seven-point scale. A handful of winners get glory and research cash (what's called \"R\"). They will, over the next four years, have to raise less of their money from student enrolments (what's called \"T\", or teaching). Easy street for the top departments. Hard times, however, for the many losers. More classroom grind. And those colleagues who let the department down (no four books) may go to the wall. </p> <p>The RAE was born out of the late Thatcher era, when some bright spark in Whitehall realised that competition and league tables were ways of getting quality without the pain of investing money (just as \"naming and shaming\" is a way of fighting crime without the expense of hiring more police). </p> <p>With the RAE, you simply told the universities to slug it out like gladiators. Last one standing was the winner. And the effort to beat the opposition (or at least get a higher grade than last time) would, it was fondly thought, produce improvement. Competition is the law of the universe. Darwin taught us that. </p> <p>It is a lousy system. Survival of the fittest may work for the animal kingdom, but it's bugger all use for tertiary education. Since the RAE was introduced, British universities have got a lot better at competing with each other, but have fallen behind in world competition - notably vis-\u00e0-vis their American counterparts. </p> <p>It's analogous to Association Football. Britain has the most elaborate and fiercely competitive league system in the world. It takes the announcer a quarter of an hour to trawl through the results at five o'clock on Saturday. And yet we can't beat Portugal. The problem that faces British universities is not that they have become fat and lazy, but that they have been starved beyond lean efficiency into inanition. </p> <p>Belatedly, the government has acknowledged the fact with one of its periodic (and pathetically inadequate) attempts to stanch the scientific brain drain. Four million pounds doesn't qualify as a finger in the dyke; you could find that much in the Dome petty-cash box. </p> <p>Competition - like whipping a horse - undoubtedly stimulates performance. But if you don't feed the horse, you can whip all you like. You won't have a winner (although it may do well against other underfed nags). </p> <p>There are worse effects of the RAE. It leads to a crudely quantitative view of research and \"productivity\". (\"Do you have your four items?\" colleagues will nervously ask one another - whether they're any good or not is a secondary consideration.) The war of all against all creates rivals out of natural allies. The scholars at neighbouring Birkbeck English department are not the opposition. But the RAE makes me think of them that way. </p> <p>It skews appointments. Many departments, under intolerable pressure to raise their grade, go head-hunting for stars. What they don't want is the young scholar who won't have any listable piece of research for 10 years. Long-term investment in human resources? Forget it. We want our five-star next April. Appoint Professor Trendhound from the University of Cutting Edge - even if you have to break the bank to get him (oh, and by the way, he doesn't want to do any teaching and wants you to find a job for his partner). </p> <p>Like the Ofsted inspections, RAE leads to human tragedies. Most departments will have colleagues who are intensely learned but for one reason or another don't write a lot. You can't cut learning into four listable items. Fire the bum - ah, Professor Trendhound, I do hope the red carpet was to your liking.</p>",

      "bodyText": "If you have friends who work in the university world, chances are they have been acting rather strangely over the last few months. Looking abstracted; muttering angrily to themselves; tearing out their hair. Another RAE - research assessment exercise - is coming up. The scheme came into existence a decade ago. What happens is that every four years, each university department the length and breadth of Britain is required to list the scholarship it has produced since the last RAE. Every member of the department is expected to come up with four items - ideally four books if you're a humanist, four better mousetraps if you're a scientist. The lists have to be in by this December. On the basis of the submission, an external panel grades the departments, creating gigantic sets of league tables out of the country's 110 or so universities. These are published next April, when the hair-tearing will begin again. Grades run on a seven-point scale. A handful of winners get glory and research cash (what's called \"R\"). They will, over the next four years, have to raise less of their money from student enrolments (what's called \"T\", or teaching). Easy street for the top departments. Hard times, however, for the many losers. More classroom grind. And those colleagues who let the department down (no four books) may go to the wall. The RAE was born out of the late Thatcher era, when some bright spark in Whitehall realised that competition and league tables were ways of getting quality without the pain of investing money (just as \"naming and shaming\" is a way of fighting crime without the expense of hiring more police). With the RAE, you simply told the universities to slug it out like gladiators. Last one standing was the winner. And the effort to beat the opposition (or at least get a higher grade than last time) would, it was fondly thought, produce improvement. Competition is the law of the universe. Darwin taught us that. It is a lousy system. Survival of the fittest may work for the animal kingdom, but it's bugger all use for tertiary education. Since the RAE was introduced, British universities have got a lot better at competing with each other, but have fallen behind in world competition - notably vis-\u00e0-vis their American counterparts. It's analogous to Association Football. Britain has the most elaborate and fiercely competitive league system in the world. It takes the announcer a quarter of an hour to trawl through the results at five o'clock on Saturday. And yet we can't beat Portugal. The problem that faces British universities is not that they have become fat and lazy, but that they have been starved beyond lean efficiency into inanition. Belatedly, the government has acknowledged the fact with one of its periodic (and pathetically inadequate) attempts to stanch the scientific brain drain. Four million pounds doesn't qualify as a finger in the dyke; you could find that much in the Dome petty-cash box. Competition - like whipping a horse - undoubtedly stimulates performance. But if you don't feed the horse, you can whip all you like. You won't have a winner (although it may do well against other underfed nags). There are worse effects of the RAE. It leads to a crudely quantitative view of research and \"productivity\". (\"Do you have your four items?\" colleagues will nervously ask one another - whether they're any good or not is a secondary consideration.) The war of all against all creates rivals out of natural allies. The scholars at neighbouring Birkbeck English department are not the opposition. But the RAE makes me think of them that way. It skews appointments. Many departments, under intolerable pressure to raise their grade, go head-hunting for stars. What they don't want is the young scholar who won't have any listable piece of research for 10 years. Long-term investment in human resources? Forget it. We want our five-star next April. Appoint Professor Trendhound from the University of Cutting Edge - even if you have to break the bank to get him (oh, and by the way, he doesn't want to do any teaching and wants you to find a job for his partner). Like the Ofsted inspections, RAE leads to human tragedies. Most departments will have colleagues who are intensely learned but for one reason or another don't write a lot. You can't cut learning into four listable items. Fire the bum - ah, Professor Trendhound, I do hope the red carpet was to your liking.",

Brown takes up the story</em></p> <p>\"The last few wickets we've played on at Northampton have turned more as the game went on. Our plan has been to bat first and rack up a big total. But this time we lost the toss and Sussex batted first. We kept them down to 232 and then Russell Warren got a big score [151].</p> <p>\"My first wicket was Robin Martin-Jenkins. It turned from wide outside off stump, didn't bounce much and went through the gate. Wasim Khan was next. I went round the wicket, the ball was angling down the legside and there was a little nick. It was pad first then bat and it went straight into Rollie's [Adrian Rollins] hands at short leg. [Umar] Rashid played on - he went back to cut and got a bottom edge onto his stumps, and [Jason] Lewry was caught at long-on by Darren [Cousins]. It was just a big yahoo really. </p> <p>\"Darren bowled well too [Cousins took 4-36, while Brown had figures of 32.3-12-53-4]. He's done well for us this season, and has got a lot of lbws because he bowls wicket to wicket.</p> <p>\"I try to give it a rip - I like to see it turn big, like to attack. I bowl into Paul Taylor's footmarks [Northamptonshire's veteran left-arm seamer] and let the rough do the rest. I was doing OK for the Second XI before I got picked this season. The wickets weren't taking much spin, but I was getting a few four-wicket hauls. [In the first team] the coach was going with the left-armer [Davies] and the offspinner [Graeme Swann]. I think we can fit all three in the same side - we all like to turn it. And me and Graeme have complemented each other well so far. We both put pressure on, and if one of us doesn't get wickets, then the other does [in tandem with Brown, Swann has taken 32 wickets at 25.88].</p> <p>\"In the second innings I got [Toby] Peirce first, caught behind. The ball turned and there was a faint nick. Then Chris Adams. It was a slower ball - it didn't bounce, but it turned and he played back to hit it through square-leg. It hit him just above the ankle - plumb! Martin-Jenkins was caught by Rollie under the helmet at short leg. It turned and bounced, he got a faint edge onto his pad and it looped up quite easily.</p> <p>\"Rashid was playing a few shots, so I gave him the slower ball, left it behind a bit. He played forward, it turned and took the outside edge, and it was another good catch for David Ripley. He's very good standing up behind the stumps. Toby Bailey [the No. 2 keeper] is good too, but Rips has the experience.</p> <p>\"For [Justin] Bates I bowled a quicker offspinner, quite straight and full. He went for the sweep and got a top edge to Graeme Swann in the 45-degrees position round the corner. Then I threw one up outside off to Jason Kirtley - it didn't bounce and hit him halfway up. Plumb again.</p> <p>\"Tony Cottey [112] played a fabulous innings. He used his feet, was quick to the ball and swept well. He didn't look in any trouble. He was in a different class - it was the first time I'd bowled to him. He kept trying to sweep me so I was going wider and wider of off stump. Eventually he tried to sweep one from really wide and dragged it onto his stumps.</p> <p>\"At the moment I'm trying not to look too far forward. It was hard enough getting into the Northants team, and there were times when I did think about leaving, even if it had meant starting in another county's second team. But I'm now in the second year of a three-year contract, and I'll still have to work hard. If an A-team spot comes up, then great. But at the moment Robert Croft's the best spinner in the country: that's why he's playing for England.</p> <p>\"My main wicket-taking delivery is probably my stock ball that pitches about a foot outside off. If it hits the rough, then it turns sharply and either keeps low or bounces. I used to watch Embers [John Emburey, who coached Northants from 1996-98] a lot, but I bowl with a bent front knee, which is unusual for spinners. I enjoyed watching Tim May bowl too: he liked to go wide of the crease, pitch it a foot outside off and make it turn big.</p> <p>\"<a href=\"http://www.cricketunlimited.co.uk/Articles/0,5217,351491,00.html\">My batting</a> isn't really something I like talking about [laughs]. I don't get much of an opportunity really. I haven't had a net since the beginning of the season, so the only real practice I get is out in the middle. But I would like to improve my batting. If I don't get picked this winter, maybe I can work on it with David Capel, Nick Cook and Bob Carter [Northants' coach]. But I did bat all day recently for the seconds. I came in as nightwatchman against Warwickshire and saved the game with 39*.</p> <p>\"The boys are in good form at the moment. We're a close unit, we're enjoying it and there's plenty of good fun and banter in the training sessions.

Sir Humphrey should go - genuinely - and be replaced by good (non-spinning) policy advisers and departmental chief executives. These people must be professionally and technically skilled and be able work with the heads of agencies and departments experienced and competent in the actual delivery of policy.",

She denied it, of course: said she had said to him something quite other - but he knew, just knew, she was wrong about that. For all sorts, oh God - so many reasons - these were words and a meeting he would never forget. </p> <p> 'It's not impossible... I felt you were over there, anyway, even if I wasn't maybe directly, er, looking, looking. I'm Jeremy.' </p> <p> The teasing drizzle of a drinks party - soon to be maddening - was all around them, but it was just as if they were alone and together, maybe deep inside a tunnel (her words were cloaked in booming). </p> <p> 'Just last week,' she said, 'they buried my brother. A simple ceremony, by all accounts.' </p> <p> Jeremy was thinking, Did I hear that right, all that - could I have and did I? What he said was, Oh. And nor even now (or ever, face it) could he not see the way she had lowered her eyes, raised them up - was casting around, newly alert, as if for the first time registering that here were people, and that they were about her. But when she looked full at and into him, that's when he suffered somewhere strange within him the first of the convulsions this woman was destined to cause him. She nodded, before she added quite softly: </p> <p> 'And three days later ... he died. My poor brother.' </p> <p> Jeremy knew that his whole face had flickered and creased in true consternation. Some person had shunted his shoulder, and his head had gone along with that, but all he saw when he brought his gaze back to her was the same, quite simple passivity there. </p> <p> 'I'm ... sorry,' he said - still feeling No Jesus, I must have misheard her, surely to God. So saying I'm sorry should just about cover the lot - empathy with her bereavement, yes, mm - or maybe regretting having been possibly caught out by little more than an acoustic blip (but also, if I'm not more drunk than I truly am feeling - and you, girl, are not either kidding or mad), well then in that case I rue the day that persons unknown interred or entombed your poor brother no fewer than a full three days before he succumbed to the thing that customarily occasions so utter a ceremony, whether it be simple or not. (Maybe I am, I must be - rather more drunk than I truly am feeling ...) </p> <p> 'Phoebe.' </p> <p> She had no more to add to any or all of it, this time round. So maybe just nudge my way a bit deeper into the demeanour of a stupid guy at a stupid party - think so? And just go for it. Like his head had just gone with his shoulder: along with it. </p> <p> 'Can I get you a ... you're not drinking - can I get you a ...?' </p> <p> And oh wow - just look at her eyes, what they're up to now: blazing right into him. Jeremy was warmed and then seared by that - he even heard the sizzling (yes I bloody am, yes I bloody did. Christ - it's hot, quite hot in here). </p> <p> 'Drink is maybe not at all a good thing. Call me Maria.' </p> <p> 'Well I bloody well like it, that's for - here, let me get you a ... I thought you said your name was ... didn't you just say -?' </p> <p> 'What? What did you think? Do you know everyone here, all these people, or what? Why did you come? Why do we do these things, actually, Jeremy? Do you know?' </p> <p> 'Phoebe. Your name. You said it was -' </p> <p> 'Didn't. No I didn't. Why would I? It isn't.' </p> <p> 'But I'm sure you said -' </p> <p> Yes I am - damn bloody sure. I'm certainly not that much drunker than I truly am feeling - although I'm feeling more so now, I have to admit it: more and more with every single second of this (whatever this is - I still can't say). </p> <p> 'No no. Freebie. I said freebie.' </p> <p> 'You said -?!' </p> <p> 'Freebie, yup. That's what I am for you. A freebie.' </p> <p> Jeremy had hardly dared look at her at all - no, not this time. He knew he was hooked (felt its tickle, feared the prick) - and when her eyes reeled him in, he would be torn away jaggedly from just everything he had. So he looked at her now, and yes, oh Christ - he was really done for. </p> <p> 'Maria,' is what he felt he whispered. And she agreed with that by just looking up and saying Yup. </p> <p> * * * </p> <p>And later that night - in the warm dark of early, before morning proper came to whiten and spike it, Jeremy had lain across her lumpish, vast and preposterous bed (it must truly have been raised four or more feet from the ground - they had helped each other up and in) and pretended as well as he could to be slumped in a mature and deep wallow of contentment, but the only good sensation now dwelt just on his skin where it touched her: the rest of him felt picked out stark by a spurious alertness that presaged only the swaddled thickness of an impending hangover, to be followed solely by the huge and engulfing bloody thing itself, no bones about that, oh no - when it came, he'd know it. </p> <p> But worse was the feeling of deep unease: it wasn't that he didn't quite feel sure of her - he was bloody sure he didn't feel sure of her: God Almighty, all those things she had said and done at the party (I think she's asleep, now - could be asleep, think so, by the look of her, just at this moment, she is), so I'll soon start easing the memory back into the spliced and jerky rut of the party, when I've just got one or two other things, if not quite out of the way, then at least stacked up neatly. I think it's Anne I ache for. Not that, no. What I mean is, I feel hollow and then briefly nauseous when I think of the ache she soon will be suffering because of me. Do you know what happened when I told Maria I was married? Know what she said? Nothing. She didn't say a thing. She put her tongue right on deep into my ear and said it reminded her of gnocchi. </p> <p> 'Her name is Anne. My wife. Her name is.' </p> <p> 'And it tastes salty. Nice.' </p> <p> Maybe not the time to mention the children. Adrian and Donna. Their names are. </p> <p> 'Maria -' </p> <p> 'Marsha.' </p> <p> 'Marsha! What in hell do you mean Marsha! You're not telling me -' </p> <p> 'No - I did tell you. I said to you Maria. My name really is Marsha, though - I just like Maria so much better.' 'Look -' </p> <p> 'Hold me tight.' </p> <p> 'Maria - it's Maria, right? Why did you do that to that man? What on earth did you do it for? Hm?' </p> <p> And yes, behind all that lay the wail of a huger and therefore silent eruption: what in hell is it that you'll do to me? </p> <p> 'What man?' </p> <p> 'What -?! What man do you think? How many men at the party did you actually assault, then, Maria? I mean - I only caught sight of the one, just before we, oh God - left, but of course he could just have been the latest in a very long line of -' </p> <p> 'Are you always like this?' </p> <p> 'Hm? What? Like what?' </p> <p> 'Like this.' </p> <p> 'What do you mean like this? Like what? What? What am I like? I'm asking you, Christ's sake.' She raised herself over him, and the flood of warmth from her breast as it teased apart the hairs on his chest made him not just gasp but of course forget. And then she said: </p> <p> 'Hold me tight.' </p> <p> And he did. </p> <p>* * * </p> <p>And after she'd refucked him (and that is surely how it had felt to white-eyed Jeremy - bruised, he was now, somewhere around that place where mute and seemingly dead extremities connected somehow with a churned-up and inner paining that tugged him) - Maria said to him brightly that she just had to (hear her?) go and fry bacon, now. Oh Christ don't, had been Jeremy's moaned-out comeback - I just couldn't think of food, not after all that booze and stuff, and those funny kind of, what were they - those gooey sort of canap*s in little pastry cases with bits of could have been grass on top. Oh you don't have to eat it, she giggled (first time he'd heard it, the giggle - or seen her as she walked away from him naked - and this and that both stopped his heart). But surely, Maria, he had urged (and we will, then - yes? We'll settle for Maria for now, will we? Well on balance yes, was Jeremy's verdict on that - until, anyway, she emerges with something freshly minted and even barmier): surely, Maria, you couldn't think of, oh God - bacon, not now, oh God you couldn't really, could you? No! That's what she called back gaily from somewhere else entirely (kitchen, yes - must be kitchen, I suppose; quite a big flat, this - quite roomy, maybe) - of course I couldn't: anyway, I'm a vegetarian - didn't you know that? No, no - I suppose you didn't. </p> <p> Explore it? Should he have? Maybe, yes, he should. Maybe right there and then he ought to have tracked her down and sought her out: what are all these things that you say and do? What on earth are they supposed to mean? Hm? And at the party - what you did, what you said - was there meaning here, or what? And if not - well what, then? </p> <p> Among whatever other things he felt he might be feeling, it was confusion that clustered round Jeremy now. He well remembered peering through the first thin mists of it - when? Not that long ago - hardly more than just a couple of life-warping hours back at this party he very nearly didn't go to, when what she had done was ... well look, no doubt Maria'd recall it quite differently (probably deny she'd even been there at all) but this is surely how it seemed to me, the way things had gone: </p> <p> 'So you're sure, then, yes?' I had kicked back in with. 'The wine's actually pretty all right, for once - red is, anyway - and I think I saw someone with a glass of -' </p> <p> 'No.' She was emphatic, Maria. But looking too so determinedly through the press of bodies and elsewhere, far beyond, that God knows, frankly, quite what she was denying. 'I need to be clear,' she had gone on, in a tone so flat and detached as to be practically spooky (had she not seemed still so physical, and therefore magnetic). 'Drink just clouds you.' </p> <p> And I suppose I had been not much more than vaguely busy summoning up some or other deeply unmirthful rejoinder to that, when I was jerked by a pull at my elbow. </p> <p> 'Jeremy!' Hugo exclaimed - it turned out to be Hugo - 'As I live and breathe.' His face was deep pinkish, going on deeper - usual thing: drink and heat and flushed and even taken in by the simulated ecstasy that one brought to parties, and wore like a pirate's parrot. </p> <p> 'Hello, Hugo,' I said. 'Thought I might see you here.' </p> <p> Knew I'd see him here, didn't I? Course I bloody did. That was the trouble, that was the trouble - all these parties, all these do's: same old faces, same old stuff. And I was at once reminded of Maria's maybe not at all rhetorical enquiry: why do we do these things? </p> <p> 'And this,' he blustered (Hugo's like that: Hugo does that), 'if I am not very much mistaken, will be the lovely, um - what are you calling yourself, these days, lovely girl?' </p> <p> And while I knuckled down to chuntering some overloud guff about Oh - I didn't realize you two, um ... knew one another, I was just knowing that Maria wouldn't like that, wouldn't at all care for what Hugo had said. That, of course, from the off and ever since, was always one of the things about Maria - I never did, even at the end, really know the first thing about her, and yet I often seemed to be able to divine her instincts. Not enough of them, of course, to later save me. But that, as I say, came later. </p> <p> 'I don't know him,' snapped Maria. 'And he doesn't know me. What he means is that I am perceived to be the adjunct of one Mister Max Bannister - and no, Hugo, he isn't here, so you can stop, now - craning your neck and drooling for favours.' </p> <p> I was out of my depth, of course, but didn't really care. Although it rang a sort of bell, I was not at all sure I'd ever heard of this Max Bannister, for starters (although I did wonder, yes, what it was she meant by an 'adjunct'). </p> <p> 'I don't know what you mean!' is the sort of way Hugo was going - a fake yet knowing outrage, cut by an undertone of what he could well have imagined was you-and-me flirty: another big mistake, it had seemed to me - and no, I wasn't wrong. </p> <p> 'Hugo,' Maria said coldly. 'Would you like to fuck me?' And in the face of his bloated 'O' of a mouth (and she sure had my attention - and yes, that of others too) she carried on implacably - though maybe no colder than coolly, now: 'You would, wouldn't you? Yes you would. But you're not going to. Know why? Because you are hideous, Hugo. Low and reptilian as well, of course, and - I am totally reliably informed - soon to be redundant. Which, strictly, you are anyway. Yes really, Hugo - that big thing. So it's Max, isn't it, you should really be fucking. But it's too late - far too late - even for that. The reason he isn't at the party, Hugo, is that he is yet again very busy working late. And, incidentally, finishing you off, Hugo. For the very last time.' </p> <p> Hugo stared. A flicker over to me to maybe gauge just how seriously I could be taking any little part of this (not at all, surely, his eyes were pleading) - or could have been just a vain hope for some sort of shelter. But mainly he stared. And when Maria crooked her finger at him, mock-enticingly, and moved away from the two of us, he followed on wide-eyed, as I did myself. By the time we found ourselves hard by the drinks table, Hugo was already attempting some sort of complicity (can you believe it?) and oozing out bait with a softly pressured urgency. </p> <p> 'Look, um - Maria. What you were saying - all that stuff you were, you know - saying, about my - job, and everything ... you didn't really mean -? I mean - he needs me - Max wouldn't just -?' </p> <p> 'Is it this Alsace you've been drinking tonight?' cut in Maria, nearly smiling. </p> <p> 'I - uh - yes, yes it is, but -' </p> <p> 'Well have some more then.' </p> <p> And then Maria went to upend the bottle all down Hugo's front - but as his hands fluttered frantically and he veered to deflect that, I saw and knew with inexplicable alarm that she wasn't seriously inclining that bottle - no, it was not her intention to pour it out or over him. And then she swung it upwards and it cracked against his jaw and Hugo - shocked now, pitching back numbly (hurt like hell later) - took the full force and fell from view as Piers came bustling up and cried What the hell and Christ, Jeremy - is this bitch with you? Get her the hell out, Chrissake - Jesus, Jesus - Hugo, are you OK? Are you? Now, Jeremy, now - I mean it - just get her out of here, kay? </p> <p> And I did. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/firstchapters/story/0,6761,354177,00.html\">Continue</a></p>",

Jeremy was warmed and then seared by that - he even heard the sizzling (yes I bloody am, yes I bloody did. Christ - it's hot, quite hot in here). 'Drink is maybe not at all a good thing. Call me Maria.' 'Well I bloody well like it, that's for - here, let me get you a ... I thought you said your name was ... didn't you just say -?' 'What? What did you think? Do you know everyone here, all these people, or what? Why did you come? Why do we do these things, actually, Jeremy? Do you know?' 'Phoebe. Your name. You said it was -' 'Didn't. No I didn't. Why would I? It isn't.' 'But I'm sure you said -' Yes I am - damn bloody sure. I'm certainly not that much drunker than I truly am feeling - although I'm feeling more so now, I have to admit it: more and more with every single second of this (whatever this is - I still can't say). 'No no. Freebie. I said freebie.' 'You said -?!' 'Freebie, yup. That's what I am for you. A freebie.' Jeremy had hardly dared look at her at all - no, not this time. He knew he was hooked (felt its tickle, feared the prick) - and when her eyes reeled him in, he would be torn away jaggedly from just everything he had. So he looked at her now, and yes, oh Christ - he was really done for. 'Maria,' is what he felt he whispered. And she agreed with that by just looking up and saying Yup. * * * And later that night - in the warm dark of early, before morning proper came to whiten and spike it, Jeremy had lain across her lumpish, vast and preposterous bed (it must truly have been raised four or more feet from the ground - they had helped each other up and in) and pretended as well as he could to be slumped in a mature and deep wallow of contentment, but the only good sensation now dwelt just on his skin where it touched her: the rest of him felt picked out stark by a spurious alertness that presaged only the swaddled thickness of an impending hangover, to be followed solely by the huge and engulfing bloody thing itself, no bones about that, oh no - when it came, he'd know it. But worse was the feeling of deep unease: it wasn't that he didn't quite feel sure of her - he was bloody sure he didn't feel sure of her: God Almighty, all those things she had said and done at the party (I think she's asleep, now - could be asleep, think so, by the look of her, just at this moment, she is), so I'll soon start easing the memory back into the spliced and jerky rut of the party, when I've just got one or two other things, if not quite out of the way, then at least stacked up neatly. I think it's Anne I ache for. Not that, no. What I mean is, I feel hollow and then briefly nauseous when I think of the ache she soon will be suffering because of me. Do you know what happened when I told Maria I was married? Know what she said? Nothing. She didn't say a thing. She put her tongue right on deep into my ear and said it reminded her of gnocchi. 'Her name is Anne. My wife. Her name is.' 'And it tastes salty. Nice.' Maybe not the time to mention the children. Adrian and Donna. Their names are. 'Maria -' 'Marsha.' 'Marsha! What in hell do you mean Marsha! You're not telling me -' 'No - I did tell you. I said to you Maria. My name really is Marsha, though - I just like Maria so much better.' 'Look -' 'Hold me tight.' 'Maria - it's Maria, right? Why did you do that to that man? What on earth did you do it for? Hm?' And yes, behind all that lay the wail of a huger and therefore silent eruption: what in hell is it that you'll do to me? 'What man?' 'What -?! What man do you think? How many men at the party did you actually assault, then, Maria? I mean - I only caught sight of the one, just before we, oh God - left, but of course he could just have been the latest in a very long line of -' 'Are you always like this?' 'Hm? What? Like what?' 'Like this.' 'What do you mean like this? Like what? What? What am I like? I'm asking you, Christ's sake.' She raised herself over him, and the flood of warmth from her breast as it teased apart the hairs on his chest made him not just gasp but of course forget. And then she said: 'Hold me tight.' And he did. * * * And after she'd refucked him (and that is surely how it had felt to white-eyed Jeremy - bruised, he was now, somewhere around that place where mute and seemingly dead extremities connected somehow with a churned-up and inner paining that tugged him) - Maria said to him brightly that she just had to (hear her?) go and fry bacon, now. Oh Christ don't, had been Jeremy's moaned-out comeback - I just couldn't think of food, not after all that booze and stuff, and those funny kind of, what were they - those gooey sort of canap*s in little pastry cases with bits of could have been grass on top. Oh you don't have to eat it, she giggled (first time he'd heard it, the giggle - or seen her as she walked away from him naked - and this and that both stopped his heart). But surely, Maria, he had urged (and we will, then - yes? We'll settle for Maria for now, will we? Well on balance yes, was Jeremy's verdict on that - until, anyway, she emerges with something freshly minted and even barmier): surely, Maria, you couldn't think of, oh God - bacon, not now, oh God you couldn't really, could you? No! That's what she called back gaily from somewhere else entirely (kitchen, yes - must be kitchen, I suppose; quite a big flat, this - quite roomy, maybe) - of course I couldn't: anyway, I'm a vegetarian - didn't you know that? No, no - I suppose you didn't. Explore it? Should he have? Maybe, yes, he should. Maybe right there and then he ought to have tracked her down and sought her out: what are all these things that you say and do? What on earth are they supposed to mean? Hm? And at the party - what you did, what you said - was there meaning here, or what? And if not - well what, then? Among whatever other things he felt he might be feeling, it was confusion that clustered round Jeremy now. He well remembered peering through the first thin mists of it - when? Not that long ago - hardly more than just a couple of life-warping hours back at this party he very nearly didn't go to, when what she had done was ... well look, no doubt Maria'd recall it quite differently (probably deny she'd even been there at all) but this is surely how it seemed to me, the way things had gone: 'So you're sure, then, yes?' I had kicked back in with. 'The wine's actually pretty all right, for once - red is, anyway - and I think I saw someone with a glass of -' 'No.' She was emphatic, Maria. But looking too so determinedly through the press of bodies and elsewhere, far beyond, that God knows, frankly, quite what she was denying. 'I need to be clear,' she had gone on, in a tone so flat and detached as to be practically spooky (had she not seemed still so physical, and therefore magnetic). 'Drink just clouds you.' And I suppose I had been not much more than vaguely busy summoning up some or other deeply unmirthful rejoinder to that, when I was jerked by a pull at my elbow. 'Jeremy!' Hugo exclaimed - it turned out to be Hugo - 'As I live and breathe.' His face was deep pinkish, going on deeper - usual thing: drink and heat and flushed and even taken in by the simulated ecstasy that one brought to parties, and wore like a pirate's parrot. 'Hello, Hugo,' I said. 'Thought I might see you here.' Knew I'd see him here, didn't I? Course I bloody did. That was the trouble, that was the trouble - all these parties, all these do's: same old faces, same old stuff. And I was at once reminded of Maria's maybe not at all rhetorical enquiry: why do we do these things? 'And this,' he blustered (Hugo's like that: Hugo does that), 'if I am not very much mistaken, will be the lovely, um - what are you calling yourself, these days, lovely girl?' And while I knuckled down to chuntering some overloud guff about Oh - I didn't realize you two, um ... knew one another, I was just knowing that Maria wouldn't like that, wouldn't at all care for what Hugo had said. That, of course, from the off and ever since, was always one of the things about Maria - I never did, even at the end, really know the first thing about her, and yet I often seemed to be able to divine her instincts. Not enough of them, of course, to later save me. But that, as I say, came later. 'I don't know him,' snapped Maria. 'And he doesn't know me. What he means is that I am perceived to be the adjunct of one Mister Max Bannister - and no, Hugo, he isn't here, so you can stop, now - craning your neck and drooling for favours.' I was out of my depth, of course, but didn't really care. Although it rang a sort of bell, I was not at all sure I'd ever heard of this Max Bannister, for starters (although I did wonder, yes, what it was she meant by an 'adjunct'). 'I don't know what you mean!' is the sort of way Hugo was going - a fake yet knowing outrage, cut by an undertone of what he could well have imagined was you-and-me flirty: another big mistake, it had seemed to me - and no, I wasn't wrong. 'Hugo,' Maria said coldly. 'Would you like to fuck me?' And in the face of his bloated 'O' of a mouth (and she sure had my attention - and yes, that of others too) she carried on implacably - though maybe no colder than coolly, now: 'You would, wouldn't you? Yes you would. But you're not going to. Know why? Because you are hideous, Hugo. Low and reptilian as well, of course, and - I am totally reliably informed - soon to be redundant. Which, strictly, you are anyway. Yes really, Hugo - that big thing. So it's Max, isn't it, you should really be fucking. But it's too late - far too late - even for that. The reason he isn't at the party, Hugo, is that he is yet again very busy working late. And, incidentally, finishing you off, Hugo. For the very last time.' Hugo stared. A flicker over to me to maybe gauge just how seriously I could be taking any little part of this (not at all, surely, his eyes were pleading) - or could have been just a vain hope for some sort of shelter. But mainly he stared. And when Maria crooked her finger at him, mock-enticingly, and moved away from the two of us, he followed on wide-eyed, as I did myself. By the time we found ourselves hard by the drinks table, Hugo was already attempting some sort of complicity (can you believe it?) and oozing out bait with a softly pressured urgency. 'Look, um - Maria. What you were saying - all that stuff you were, you know - saying, about my - job, and everything ... you didn't really mean -? I mean - he needs me - Max wouldn't just -?' 'Is it this Alsace you've been drinking tonight?' cut in Maria, nearly smiling. 'I - uh - yes, yes it is, but -' 'Well have some more then.' And then Maria went to upend the bottle all down Hugo's front - but as his hands fluttered frantically and he veered to deflect that, I saw and knew with inexplicable alarm that she wasn't seriously inclining that bottle - no, it was not her intention to pour it out or over him. And then she swung it upwards and it cracked against his jaw and Hugo - shocked now, pitching back numbly (hurt like hell later) - took the full force and fell from view as Piers came bustling up and cried What the hell and Christ, Jeremy - is this bitch with you? Get her the hell out, Chrissake - Jesus, Jesus - Hugo, are you OK? Are you? Now, Jeremy, now - I mean it - just get her out of here, kay? And I did. Continue",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>'So who is he?' Jeremy grunted later. </p> <p> Maria was pouring tea, really quite sweetly: proper tea, proper pot. </p> <p> 'Who's who?' </p> <p> 'This ... Max - what was it? Bannister character.' </p> <p> 'Oh - you don't really want to know.' </p> <p> 'I wouldn't have asked.' </p> <p> 'He's just ... someone.' </p> <p> 'Just someone. Uh huh. And me? I'm just someone too, am I?' </p> <p> Maria smiled. 'You're Jeremy.' </p> <p> And Jeremy smiled too - partly because when she did, you just had to, but also by way of gentlemanly concession of yet another small defeat in another little battle that, oddly, no one had waged. It was just that ... oh God - this was far from being the first of these circuitous and utterly pointless exchanges: Maria could have chattered on like this for the rest of the night, and still by dawn you'd end up with nothing. Maybe give it just one more go. I don't know, though. It was that brief and fleeting mention of dawn, just there (and look at the curtains: I can make out their colour). What will Anne say? Worse: what is it that I'll end up telling her? OK, then - one more go. What's to lose? (I'm lost already.) </p> <p> 'So then - this Max person. He's your, what - bloke, is he?' </p> <p> 'What a ghastly word: bloke.' </p> <p> 'But he is, is he? And he's Hugo's boss - did I get that right?' </p> <p> 'Not any more he isn't. Sacked him. Told you.' </p> <p> 'Why did you do that to Hugo? You could have broken his -' </p> <p> 'I didn't break anything. People like Hugo expect it. Are you staying?' </p> <p> Well? Am I? Well I am, yes, in that I've been putting off getting home for as long as I possibly can - and yet, oh God, the longer I leave it ... </p> <p> 'Depends. What are we doing, Maria? What do you want of me? What are we going to do about this thing?' </p> <p> 'You know what I want of you, Jeremy. You know exactly what.' </p> <p> 'And Max?' </p> <p>'Oh God do stop going on about him, can't you? Max is just Max, OK? And you're you. That's enough, isn't it?' </p> <p> 'Well no, not really - not at all, in fact. Look, Maria - we've got to get something straight: I'm married, and -' </p> <p> 'Marsha.' </p> <p> 'What?!' 'Some days I like my real name better - today is one of those.' </p> <p> 'Yeh? Well you're going to be Maria, OK? Change name once more and I'll go crazy. Oh Christ - I've completely forgotten what I was saying now ...' </p> <p> 'Don't say anything. Just hold me tight.' </p> <p> 'Maria ...!' </p> <p> 'Just hold me. You know you want to.' </p> <p> 'I do want to, I do - but ... God, you know, Maria - I know it sounds a bit of a ... well, clich*, I suppose - you see it in films, all this, don't you? These scenes. But I feel as if I've known you for ... as if I will know you for ...' </p> <p> 'Ever. I know. Hold me.' </p> <p> 'I have to go. I have to think. There's Anne to think of ... don't you want to know anything about me? About her? And there are children - I have two. I can't hurt them - can't ever bear to hurt them.' </p> <p> 'I'm not asking you to hurt them. I'm asking you to hold me. Hold me.' </p> <p> 'Maria - please -!' </p> <p> 'Shall we go back to bed? Do you want to?' </p> <p> 'I have to go. Of course I want to!' </p> <p> 'Well come on, then. Come on. Come to bed and hold me tight.' </p> <p> 'Oh God.' </p> <p> 'Come on ...' </p> <p> 'OK, OK - all right. And then, and then - I really have to go. OK? Yes, Maria? Say yes. I leave at nine - OK? Yes? At nine sharp, I am definitely leaving.' </p> <p> But I didn't. </p> <p> Did, eventually. Eventually Jeremy did manage to peel himself away from that girl and her things. It had taken, the whole process, just about for ever because listen: first, as soon as one of Maria's cool and soothing hands had reluctantly left him, the fingers of the other would maybe snake over a shoulder, or slide into one of his - could cup his jaw or tease those stiffly electrified hairs at the back of his neck; and second ... well, second: he just didn't want to go. But then as soon as he had actually done it (I am out, yes out of there - down those stairs, away from the warm and back in the street) and conducted a rapid roll-call of not just his parts but also the state of them - then so did he feel more chilled and alone than ever he could recall; and not as he first thought by the dread of going on home - facing what had to be faced there, no - but by the very emptiness that gapingly filled him. He blinked in the consciousness of knowing that being without Maria just simply had no point: it felt all wrong and it had no point. And yet before the party that he nearly didn't go to, he had not even known she had ever been born. But everything, all of it, seemed different now. </p> <p> Better get home to Anne and the kids: hear firsthand what it is I'm going to say. (How can it be that this girl has got me? It's not as if she's even very nice.) </p> <p> * * * </p> <p> 'Christ, you know,' laughed Max, 'I really do think Hugo must have lost his bleeding mind. You listening, Feebs? Says you said I'd chucked him from the company - something - and then you upped and clocked him with a bottle! Didn't think you was even going to that bash - why did you?' </p> <p> 'Because I was bored. Wasn't going to. And then I did. Because big shot Max Bannister was working again - remember? Anyway - just can't stand that creep. What did you say to him?' </p> <p> 'Didn't get much of a chance to say anything to him, did I? Bloke marches in, first thing this morning - looking bleeding rough, I gotta say -' </p> <p> 'Oh shit ...' </p> <p> 'What?' </p> <p> 'Spilt drink. Doesn't matter. Go on.' </p> <p> 'Always spilling something, aren't you, Feebs?' </p> <p> 'Oh Christ sake don't keep calling me that. I keep on telling you Marsha. Anyway - spilling you, soon.' </p> <p> 'What? What say? Spilling what? And you can fuck off with your bleeding Marsha caper, baby - I call you Feebs cos it's your sodding name, isn't it? Phoebe? Isn't it?' </p> <p> 'Max. I just don't want to talk to you any more. Kay? Just don't want to. Don't want you to be here.' </p> <p> 'Charmed. Anyway - off soon. Meeting. So - you give Hugo a smacking or didn't you?' </p> <p> 'What did he say to you? And you don't seem to get me, Max - I mean I don't want you around.' </p> <p> 'Yeh - you said. Bleeding polite. No - what he said to me was - barged right in, like I say, and he says OK Max You Bastard - nice, ay? OK, Max you bastard, he says - I've got the fucking truth, you bloody bastard - so now I'm really warming to the guy, aren't I? So I start in with Hey Hey Hey - don't know what the fuck you're talking about, do I? And he goes Oh Yeah Like Hell - she told me the lot. Anyway, he says - and he's really worked up now, telling you: veins standing out on him - anyway, he goes - what you can do is you can stuff your crap bloody job where the stars don't twinkle, mate - you're not sacking me, you bastard, cos I'm out of here. Amazing or what? And I'm like going, excuse me? Didn't know what the prat was on about, did I? So he's really kicking into me now, you know - so I just bloody let him have it: Hugo, I said, I don't know who's been telling you what, and I don't much care about whether you think you're junked or tendering your thing - resignation, right? But you're dead on the money on one score, my friend - you're fucking out the door, that's for bleeding sure. Should've seen his face!' </p> <p> 'So he's gone?' </p> <p> 'Not many. Too right. Then he starts going for me physical! Soon put paid to that little caper. Ow ow ow, he goes - once I'd dotted his bloody i's for him, cheeky sod. And he's, like - first your bird fucking brains me with a bottle, now you've gone and broken my bloody nose! Ha ha. Gotta laugh. Prat.' </p> <p> 'Yeah he is. He tried it on with me one time, you know.' </p> <p> 'Yeah? Bastard. Should've told. Would've done for him, period.' </p> <p> 'Yeh well. He's out now. And so are you, Max, by the way. So are you. Not so much big time as all the way, yeah?' </p> <p> 'What you on about, now, darling? I own the bloody company, don't I? Ay? So what you talking about now, then, Feebs?' </p> <p> 'I mean, Max, you're out of my life. From last night. When you wouldn't even come to a party. Again.' </p> <p> 'What's ... this? You joking or what, Phoebe?' </p> <p> 'Marsha, you bastard! No, Max. No joke. I don't - do I?' </p> <p> 'Phoebe - Marsha, honey: talk to me. What's got into you, hey? Not like you to do all this on me. Not your number.' </p> <p> 'I do all this when it's over. Haven't you got a meeting to go to, Max?' </p> <p> 'Hm? Oh fuck it - meeting can wait. Listen, Feebs -' </p> <p> 'They never waited for you before, though, did they, Max? Your bloody day and night endless important meetings. Hm? And if you call me that just one more time I walk right now and that's the end of me, I'm telling you.' </p> <p> 'You're ... not kidding me, are you, love?' </p> <p> 'Got it. Not.' </p> <p> 'But listen - hey: lisssen - you and me, we're all right! We're OK, us. Look, let's go and have a spot of - let's go over to Sophie's ... you like it there, yeh? Give ourselves a really boozy lunch, ay? Ay? How about it? Then we come home and I'll change your mind. Press all the right buttons. Sound good?' </p> <p> 'Sounds ... laughable. Laughable, Max. Understand: I'm not telling you I want more attention - I used to, all the time I used to, but now I just don't. Want any. Want out. Too late. I'm not saying Hey - let's talk it over - no, Max, I'm not. I'm simply informing you that it has ceased. As from last night.' </p> <p> 'As from last night ... Just like that. Ceased.' </p> <p> 'Correct. So why don't you go to your meeting, hm? And then when it's over - well then you'll know that we are too.' </p> <p> 'Look ... Marsha, love ...' </p> <p> 'Bye, Max. Some of it was nice.' </p> <p> 'Don't ... leave me, baby. Don't just walk.' </p> <p> 'Bye. I won't say See You.' </p> <p> 'Here - you got another bloke or what, you bitch?' </p> <p> 'Yeah.' </p> <p> 'Yeah! Yeah! What you fucking mean - yeah?! Since bloody when, you slag?' </p> <p> 'As from last night. Told you.' </p> <p> 'As from ... Christ, it's not fucking Hugo, is it?' </p> <p> 'Oh God, Max - you just don't see anything.' 'Yeah? Oh yeah? Well let me just tell you, you cunt - I see this - I see this - I see bloody you for exactly what you bloody are, you ... you -' </p> <p> 'I go now.' </p> <p> 'So who is he? Hey? Who is he, this Mister Bleeding Wonderful? What's so fucking great about him, hey? He got money? Who is he? What does he do?!' </p> <p> 'What he does, Max, is he calls me Maria - which is one step further on. This is what I need and all I want, just now. It's not important if you don't understand.' </p> <p> Maria turned and easily walked away. Max bloody knew he - Christ yes - had one helluva lot more than this to hit the cow with, but found himself caught up and dumbed by the sidle of her hips, and the long legs idling away from them. His mouth was still wide open and silent as the door kissed shut quite softly behind her. </p> <p>* * * </p> <p>And then I just did, then, did I? Go home? Jeremy had often wondered at this from the distant vantage point of what could never, even then, be thought of as anything ever close to a haven, no - simply later on, is all. Time helps. Helped me along, anyway - until it comes full circle and turns and confronts you and trips you up just one more time, it can generally be relied on to do that thing people always assure you it will: heal - or anyway make it blunter and hurt less. But when you are actually in the midst of a spotlit scene that's ticking away, ticking away - even if it's horrible (and that episode with Anne, the one I'm thinking of that time when I went home the next day, God it was - it was horrible, that) - everything seems so utterly natural, no matter how strange: completely unalterable, like the lie of the down as it glistens on your forearm. What is good, though, is that after seemingly ages (but maybe only just long enough) every prickled and all-too-see-through hair begins to bunch up and thicken, before blurring into fur and softening the worst of it: a protection of sorts, and one needs and hugs it. But as you play your part, second by second in the here and now - ah well then, then there can be no defence at all, not then: you're out there, stark and alone - knowing it's real, though barely believing it can be. </p> <p> And it just had to be a Saturday, didn't it? Adrian and Donna - not at school: doesn't exactly help, does it? Well - didn't matter awfully much in Donna's case, if I'm being quite frank here. She was five then, just on - and I don't know if it's just with little girls (always more difficult with Adrian) but I always found that if you just smile in their direction and keep on fishing out treat after treat from your secret store of goodies, they just about swallow down anything, some kids - though that glint of doubt shows me clearly that they don't wholly trust themselves for doing so, let alone you, for needing their collaboration. </p> <p> Adrian, though - different, quite different. Thirteen he was then, pretty close (very close, in point of fact, because his birthday was due, I will always remember, on the Thursday of the following week - wasn't there for it: gone by then). And he's always seemed older than his years, has Adrian - always regarded him with an air of awe, maybe respect (and sometimes, inexplicably, even fear: my very own son - odd or what?). And yes, I well know that the gap between the two kids was seen to be a long one - nearly eight years, yes that's long - used even to joke about it in the old (old) days: Waaaal, I'd drawl - you get so tired, don't you, ay? Started off as a joke, anyway (don't things, often?), but soon it had become uncomfortably close to the heart of the matter: just ask Anne. No - don't bother: she'll tell you herself - she is, I'm told, unstoppable now. She'll say to you something like (I can well imagine) - Oh Jeremy, poor Jeremy - had a permanent migraine, poor darling; well - not permanent permanent: lasted from when I joined him in bed at night-time until he bounded up and out in the morning, eager to be simply anywhere else at all! Something, I should think, on those lines. And she had a point, be fair. It's not that I found her unattractive, as such - it was just that she was, well - Anne, if you see what I'm saying. And mother to Adrian and Donna. And God, they both of them - facially, you know - are so much like her it's weird, I'm telling you. Particularly Adrian. The looks he sometimes gives you - like that one that kissed me full in the face and shamingly dead centre when I did eventually get home that first morning after that first night with Maria (no hint of migraine then, I recall: came like a train - came again like another one). And look at Anne, now - just look at her, will you? Same expression as the boy - same exactly. Same face, you see: same accusatory and heavy-veiled eyes - and yes, almost certainly, same dark thoughts lurking behind them (leaving suspicion way behind, and closing in fast on outright condemnation). </p> <p> I lit a last cigarette - exhaling, I thought reasonably coolly. I never did smoke heavily, but without knowing it, I was poised on giving them up completely - that very hour and quite without trying (along with so much else - all, indeed, I ever had). Anne was fiercely grinding down a lemon half on the Juicy Salif - that jaunty and gunmetal squeezer - something, I know it sounds silly, I had asked her never to do. I'm odd, I think, among my fellow designers in that I always feel that these beautiful objects are best left alone - whatever their function: chairs or shelves, vases and bowls - even lamps and bottles, sometimes. Don't make them work, is what I'm thinking: why don't you just let them be? Not Anne. Not only would she sprawl all over the Charles Eames lounger, or recklessly nudge Corbusier's masterpiece, the chrome and leather Grand Confort, hopelessly out of square - she'd even deck them with newspapers and, oh God - cushions. This hurt me - and I don't really care how that comes over. And yes of course I now see that this is maybe - not maybe - just why she did it. Any other time and my opening line could well have been, Anne - Anne? Listen to me, Anne: I've told you, what - how many times is it now? We've got other squeezers, haven't we? Hm? We even bought that electric juicer. So why the Starck? Hey? Tell me please. Of all the gadgets, why the one that's just perfect in repose? Yes - I did, with Anne, find myself sounding quite as arch as that, and sometimes a good deal more so. Only with Anne, I think (and ever-increasingly, I now see, towards what I didn't really know would be the end). But with four hard eyes, now, burning right into me (and Donna would not be long in catching up) that is not what I thought I should say. What would have come, I couldn't tell you (I remember an almost hysterical giddiness, something approaching a mad excitement - so eager was I still to be first to hear just exactly what it was I might go for) - because it was Anne, tossing the lemon rind almost into my gleaming Brabantia wastebin (the chromework now streaky, I just had to observe) - who looked up and nearly at me and spoke: </p> <p> 'Hugo rang. Said he saw you. Good night?' </p> <p> 'Daddy,' said Adrian - truly gravely - 'have you really just come in from last night this morning?' </p> <p> 'Hugo?' I heard, the second I said it. </p> <p> 'Something about someone hit him and he's lost his job? In a terrible state, sounded like.' </p> <p> What was this voice of hers saying to me? That's what I was busy working out. </p> <p> 'Hugo?' I said again - which was thoroughly absurd, this time round. </p> <p> 'Daddy?' insisted bloody Adrian. 'Have you? Really just come home now for the very first time since last night?' </p> <p> 'Wasn't a bad party. As these things go. Usual crowd. Should've come! Met someone called - can't recall his ... new face. Insisted we go on to some bloody club or other, couldn't tell you where. Hellhole. Potential client, though, so I thought I ought. God knows where the time went.' </p> <p> Ah. So that's what it was I was going to say. </p> <p> 'Daddeeeee!' piped up little Donna, God love her and save her. 'Did you bring me anything? Daddeeeee? Did you?' </p> <p> 'And me!' shot in Adrian (no slouch when it comes to handouts: wouldn't believe he'd been judge and jury just two seconds earlier). </p> <p> 'Of course, my angels - would I forget you? Never really ever known quite what it is that Hugo actually does, you know - never really thought to ask him. You seem to know him better than I do. Can be a hell of a bore - and worse when he's pissed.' </p> <p> 'Piss,' pouted Donna, 'is naughty.' </p> <p> While I was laughing like a madman at that - it got me off, didn't it, for the moment, saying any more? - Anne started looking at me deeply: made the whole of my head twitch, when she did all that - could almost feel the insistent probing, like a dentist's cruel and gleaming tool (scraping away, scraping away) as all my nerve-ends clenched and cowered. </p> <p> 'Piss isn't naughty!' poo-pooed Adrian, at his most elevated and worldly. 'Piss is just crap.' </p> <p> Anne had the goodness to say Adrian - short and reproving - and I did, I think, snigger at the flicker of utter confusion across dear little Donna's big and trusting eyes. And then, as they do, she forgot it all completely. </p> <p> 'Well where is it, Daddeeeee?' she now was singing. 'My present - where is it?' </p> <p> 'Shouldn't expect presents,' Anne was more or less grunting. 'Just because your father's been out all night ...' (and now, by God, those two bloody piercing eyes of hers had bored their way right between mine - were nearly out the other side) '... why should we expect him to give us anything?' </p> <p> 'But he said ...' protested Donna, close to tears, now. </p> <p> 'And I meant it,' was the magnanimous retort from her great grand father. Who legged it up the stairs to his study as fast as he decently dared (thank Christ Round One's in the bag) - for there was his life-saving cache of Smarties and trolls, Pez dispensers, key-rings, felt pens, dollies, toy cars, sticker sets and comics (never much of anything too beautifully packaged, though - just couldn't bear it when they tore them apart). </p> <p>While he sat at his desk - one hand cradling his newly aching temple, the other rootling around for just the right level of diversionary tactic and conscience-appeaser (not so derisory as to be scornfully everyday, nor so lavish as to nakedly betoken a crime on his part) - Jeremy suddenly caved in with a rush of tiredness and just the temporary easing of a tension that would soon be back in place, to keep him alert and protect him. And it shocked him when all of that was slid away and in came lust - the sudden vision of Maria's long and cool and warm-hot thighs (and silky, yes - they had been silky) just before they had locked themselves to each side of his face, the appalling softness of her skin making his pre-dawn stubble ache first, and then sting. It was her legs - that and the way they had carried her over: those legs of Maria's were walking all over him. </p>",

      "bodyText": "'So who is he?' Jeremy grunted later. Maria was pouring tea, really quite sweetly: proper tea, proper pot. 'Who's who?' 'This ... Max - what was it? Bannister character.' 'Oh - you don't really want to know.' 'I wouldn't have asked.' 'He's just ... someone.' 'Just someone. Uh huh. And me? I'm just someone too, am I?' Maria smiled. 'You're Jeremy.' And Jeremy smiled too - partly because when she did, you just had to, but also by way of gentlemanly concession of yet another small defeat in another little battle that, oddly, no one had waged. It was just that ... oh God - this was far from being the first of these circuitous and utterly pointless exchanges: Maria could have chattered on like this for the rest of the night, and still by dawn you'd end up with nothing. Maybe give it just one more go. I don't know, though. It was that brief and fleeting mention of dawn, just there (and look at the curtains: I can make out their colour). What will Anne say? Worse: what is it that I'll end up telling her? OK, then - one more go. What's to lose? (I'm lost already.) 'So then - this Max person. He's your, what - bloke, is he?' 'What a ghastly word: bloke.' 'But he is, is he? And he's Hugo's boss - did I get that right?' 'Not any more he isn't. Sacked him. Told you.' 'Why did you do that to Hugo? You could have broken his -' 'I didn't break anything. People like Hugo expect it. Are you staying?' Well? Am I? Well I am, yes, in that I've been putting off getting home for as long as I possibly can - and yet, oh God, the longer I leave it ... 'Depends. What are we doing, Maria? What do you want of me? What are we going to do about this thing?' 'You know what I want of you, Jeremy. You know exactly what.' 'And Max?' 'Oh God do stop going on about him, can't you? Max is just Max, OK? And you're you. That's enough, isn't it?' 'Well no, not really - not at all, in fact. Look, Maria - we've got to get something straight: I'm married, and -' 'Marsha.' 'What?!' 'Some days I like my real name better - today is one of those.' 'Yeh? Well you're going to be Maria, OK? Change name once more and I'll go crazy. Oh Christ - I've completely forgotten what I was saying now ...' 'Don't say anything. Just hold me tight.' 'Maria ...!' 'Just hold me. You know you want to.' 'I do want to, I do - but ... God, you know, Maria - I know it sounds a bit of a ... well, clich*, I suppose - you see it in films, all this, don't you? These scenes. But I feel as if I've known you for ... as if I will know you for ...' 'Ever. I know. Hold me.' 'I have to go. I have to think. There's Anne to think of ... don't you want to know anything about me? About her? And there are children - I have two. I can't hurt them - can't ever bear to hurt them.' 'I'm not asking you to hurt them. I'm asking you to hold me. Hold me.' 'Maria - please -!' 'Shall we go back to bed? Do you want to?' 'I have to go. Of course I want to!' 'Well come on, then. Come on. Come to bed and hold me tight.' 'Oh God.' 'Come on ...' 'OK, OK - all right. And then, and then - I really have to go. OK? Yes, Maria? Say yes. I leave at nine - OK? Yes? At nine sharp, I am definitely leaving.' But I didn't. Did, eventually. Eventually Jeremy did manage to peel himself away from that girl and her things. It had taken, the whole process, just about for ever because listen: first, as soon as one of Maria's cool and soothing hands had reluctantly left him, the fingers of the other would maybe snake over a shoulder, or slide into one of his - could cup his jaw or tease those stiffly electrified hairs at the back of his neck; and second ... well, second: he just didn't want to go. But then as soon as he had actually done it (I am out, yes out of there - down those stairs, away from the warm and back in the street) and conducted a rapid roll-call of not just his parts but also the state of them - then so did he feel more chilled and alone than ever he could recall; and not as he first thought by the dread of going on home - facing what had to be faced there, no - but by the very emptiness that gapingly filled him. He blinked in the consciousness of knowing that being without Maria just simply had no point: it felt all wrong and it had no point. And yet before the party that he nearly didn't go to, he had not even known she had ever been born. But everything, all of it, seemed different now. Better get home to Anne and the kids: hear firsthand what it is I'm going to say. (How can it be that this girl has got me? It's not as if she's even very nice.) * * * 'Christ, you know,' laughed Max, 'I really do think Hugo must have lost his bleeding mind. You listening, Feebs? Says you said I'd chucked him from the company - something - and then you upped and clocked him with a bottle! Didn't think you was even going to that bash - why did you?' 'Because I was bored. Wasn't going to. And then I did. Because big shot Max Bannister was working again - remember? Anyway - just can't stand that creep. What did you say to him?' 'Didn't get much of a chance to say anything to him, did I? Bloke marches in, first thing this morning - looking bleeding rough, I gotta say -' 'Oh shit ...' 'What?' 'Spilt drink. Doesn't matter. Go on.' 'Always spilling something, aren't you, Feebs?' 'Oh Christ sake don't keep calling me that. I keep on telling you Marsha. Anyway - spilling you, soon.' 'What? What say? Spilling what? And you can fuck off with your bleeding Marsha caper, baby - I call you Feebs cos it's your sodding name, isn't it? Phoebe? Isn't it?' 'Max. I just don't want to talk to you any more. Kay? Just don't want to. Don't want you to be here.' 'Charmed. Anyway - off soon. Meeting. So - you give Hugo a smacking or didn't you?' 'What did he say to you? And you don't seem to get me, Max - I mean I don't want you around.' 'Yeh - you said. Bleeding polite. No - what he said to me was - barged right in, like I say, and he says OK Max You Bastard - nice, ay? OK, Max you bastard, he says - I've got the fucking truth, you bloody bastard - so now I'm really warming to the guy, aren't I? So I start in with Hey Hey Hey - don't know what the fuck you're talking about, do I? And he goes Oh Yeah Like Hell - she told me the lot. Anyway, he says - and he's really worked up now, telling you: veins standing out on him - anyway, he goes - what you can do is you can stuff your crap bloody job where the stars don't twinkle, mate - you're not sacking me, you bastard, cos I'm out of here. Amazing or what? And I'm like going, excuse me? Didn't know what the prat was on about, did I? So he's really kicking into me now, you know - so I just bloody let him have it: Hugo, I said, I don't know who's been telling you what, and I don't much care about whether you think you're junked or tendering your thing - resignation, right? But you're dead on the money on one score, my friend - you're fucking out the door, that's for bleeding sure. Should've seen his face!' 'So he's gone?' 'Not many. Too right. Then he starts going for me physical! Soon put paid to that little caper. Ow ow ow, he goes - once I'd dotted his bloody i's for him, cheeky sod. And he's, like - first your bird fucking brains me with a bottle, now you've gone and broken my bloody nose! Ha ha. Gotta laugh. Prat.' 'Yeah he is. He tried it on with me one time, you know.' 'Yeah? Bastard. Should've told. Would've done for him, period.' 'Yeh well. He's out now. And so are you, Max, by the way. So are you. Not so much big time as all the way, yeah?' 'What you on about, now, darling? I own the bloody company, don't I? Ay? So what you talking about now, then, Feebs?' 'I mean, Max, you're out of my life. From last night. When you wouldn't even come to a party. Again.' 'What's ... this? You joking or what, Phoebe?' 'Marsha, you bastard! No, Max. No joke. I don't - do I?' 'Phoebe - Marsha, honey: talk to me. What's got into you, hey? Not like you to do all this on me. Not your number.' 'I do all this when it's over. Haven't you got a meeting to go to, Max?' 'Hm? Oh fuck it - meeting can wait. Listen, Feebs -' 'They never waited for you before, though, did they, Max? Your bloody day and night endless important meetings. Hm? And if you call me that just one more time I walk right now and that's the end of me, I'm telling you.' 'You're ... not kidding me, are you, love?' 'Got it. Not.' 'But listen - hey: lisssen - you and me, we're all right! We're OK, us. Look, let's go and have a spot of - let's go over to Sophie's ... you like it there, yeh? Give ourselves a really boozy lunch, ay? Ay? How about it? Then we come home and I'll change your mind. Press all the right buttons. Sound good?' 'Sounds ... laughable. Laughable, Max. Understand: I'm not telling you I want more attention - I used to, all the time I used to, but now I just don't. Want any. Want out. Too late. I'm not saying Hey - let's talk it over - no, Max, I'm not. I'm simply informing you that it has ceased. As from last night.' 'As from last night ... Just like that. Ceased.' 'Correct. So why don't you go to your meeting, hm? And then when it's over - well then you'll know that we are too.' 'Look ... Marsha, love ...' 'Bye, Max. Some of it was nice.' 'Don't ... leave me, baby. Don't just walk.' 'Bye. I won't say See You.' 'Here - you got another bloke or what, you bitch?' 'Yeah.' 'Yeah! Yeah! What you fucking mean - yeah?! Since bloody when, you slag?' 'As from last night. Told you.' 'As from ... Christ, it's not fucking Hugo, is it?' 'Oh God, Max - you just don't see anything.' 'Yeah? Oh yeah? Well let me just tell you, you cunt - I see this - I see this - I see bloody you for exactly what you bloody are, you ... you -' 'I go now.' 'So who is he? Hey? Who is he, this Mister Bleeding Wonderful? What's so fucking great about him, hey? He got money? Who is he? What does he do?!' 'What he does, Max, is he calls me Maria - which is one step further on. This is what I need and all I want, just now. It's not important if you don't understand.' Maria turned and easily walked away. Max bloody knew he - Christ yes - had one helluva lot more than this to hit the cow with, but found himself caught up and dumbed by the sidle of her hips, and the long legs idling away from them. His mouth was still wide open and silent as the door kissed shut quite softly behind her. * * * And then I just did, then, did I? Go home? Jeremy had often wondered at this from the distant vantage point of what could never, even then, be thought of as anything ever close to a haven, no - simply later on, is all. Time helps. Helped me along, anyway - until it comes full circle and turns and confronts you and trips you up just one more time, it can generally be relied on to do that thing people always assure you it will: heal - or anyway make it blunter and hurt less. But when you are actually in the midst of a spotlit scene that's ticking away, ticking away - even if it's horrible (and that episode with Anne, the one I'm thinking of that time when I went home the next day, God it was - it was horrible, that) - everything seems so utterly natural, no matter how strange: completely unalterable, like the lie of the down as it glistens on your forearm. What is good, though, is that after seemingly ages (but maybe only just long enough) every prickled and all-too-see-through hair begins to bunch up and thicken, before blurring into fur and softening the worst of it: a protection of sorts, and one needs and hugs it. But as you play your part, second by second in the here and now - ah well then, then there can be no defence at all, not then: you're out there, stark and alone - knowing it's real, though barely believing it can be. And it just had to be a Saturday, didn't it? Adrian and Donna - not at school: doesn't exactly help, does it? Well - didn't matter awfully much in Donna's case, if I'm being quite frank here. She was five then, just on - and I don't know if it's just with little girls (always more difficult with Adrian) but I always found that if you just smile in their direction and keep on fishing out treat after treat from your secret store of goodies, they just about swallow down anything, some kids - though that glint of doubt shows me clearly that they don't wholly trust themselves for doing so, let alone you, for needing their collaboration. Adrian, though - different, quite different. Thirteen he was then, pretty close (very close, in point of fact, because his birthday was due, I will always remember, on the Thursday of the following week - wasn't there for it: gone by then). And he's always seemed older than his years, has Adrian - always regarded him with an air of awe, maybe respect (and sometimes, inexplicably, even fear: my very own son - odd or what?). And yes, I well know that the gap between the two kids was seen to be a long one - nearly eight years, yes that's long - used even to joke about it in the old (old) days: Waaaal, I'd drawl - you get so tired, don't you, ay? Started off as a joke, anyway (don't things, often?), but soon it had become uncomfortably close to the heart of the matter: just ask Anne. No - don't bother: she'll tell you herself - she is, I'm told, unstoppable now. She'll say to you something like (I can well imagine) - Oh Jeremy, poor Jeremy - had a permanent migraine, poor darling; well - not permanent permanent: lasted from when I joined him in bed at night-time until he bounded up and out in the morning, eager to be simply anywhere else at all! Something, I should think, on those lines. And she had a point, be fair. It's not that I found her unattractive, as such - it was just that she was, well - Anne, if you see what I'm saying. And mother to Adrian and Donna. And God, they both of them - facially, you know - are so much like her it's weird, I'm telling you. Particularly Adrian. The looks he sometimes gives you - like that one that kissed me full in the face and shamingly dead centre when I did eventually get home that first morning after that first night with Maria (no hint of migraine then, I recall: came like a train - came again like another one). And look at Anne, now - just look at her, will you? Same expression as the boy - same exactly. Same face, you see: same accusatory and heavy-veiled eyes - and yes, almost certainly, same dark thoughts lurking behind them (leaving suspicion way behind, and closing in fast on outright condemnation). I lit a last cigarette - exhaling, I thought reasonably coolly. I never did smoke heavily, but without knowing it, I was poised on giving them up completely - that very hour and quite without trying (along with so much else - all, indeed, I ever had). Anne was fiercely grinding down a lemon half on the Juicy Salif - that jaunty and gunmetal squeezer - something, I know it sounds silly, I had asked her never to do. I'm odd, I think, among my fellow designers in that I always feel that these beautiful objects are best left alone - whatever their function: chairs or shelves, vases and bowls - even lamps and bottles, sometimes. Don't make them work, is what I'm thinking: why don't you just let them be? Not Anne. Not only would she sprawl all over the Charles Eames lounger, or recklessly nudge Corbusier's masterpiece, the chrome and leather Grand Confort, hopelessly out of square - she'd even deck them with newspapers and, oh God - cushions. This hurt me - and I don't really care how that comes over. And yes of course I now see that this is maybe - not maybe - just why she did it. Any other time and my opening line could well have been, Anne - Anne? Listen to me, Anne: I've told you, what - how many times is it now? We've got other squeezers, haven't we? Hm? We even bought that electric juicer. So why the Starck? Hey? Tell me please. Of all the gadgets, why the one that's just perfect in repose? Yes - I did, with Anne, find myself sounding quite as arch as that, and sometimes a good deal more so.

'Of course, my angels - would I forget you? Never really ever known quite what it is that Hugo actually does, you know - never really thought to ask him. You seem to know him better than I do. Can be a hell of a bore - and worse when he's pissed.' 'Piss,' pouted Donna, 'is naughty.' While I was laughing like a madman at that - it got me off, didn't it, for the moment, saying any more? - Anne started looking at me deeply: made the whole of my head twitch, when she did all that - could almost feel the insistent probing, like a dentist's cruel and gleaming tool (scraping away, scraping away) as all my nerve-ends clenched and cowered. 'Piss isn't naughty!' poo-pooed Adrian, at his most elevated and worldly. 'Piss is just crap.' Anne had the goodness to say Adrian - short and reproving - and I did, I think, snigger at the flicker of utter confusion across dear little Donna's big and trusting eyes. And then, as they do, she forgot it all completely. 'Well where is it, Daddeeeee?' she now was singing. 'My present - where is it?' 'Shouldn't expect presents,' Anne was more or less grunting. 'Just because your father's been out all night ...' (and now, by God, those two bloody piercing eyes of hers had bored their way right between mine - were nearly out the other side) '... why should we expect him to give us anything?'

Who legged it up the stairs to his study as fast as he decently dared (thank Christ Round One's in the bag) - for there was his life-saving cache of Smarties and trolls, Pez dispensers, key-rings, felt pens, dollies, toy cars, sticker sets and comics (never much of anything too beautifully packaged, though - just couldn't bear it when they tore them apart).

The number of internet users in the United States is expected to reach 157.3m by 2003 - and poorer regions, too, are getting in on the act, with Latin America overcoming numerous practical hurdles to get its population online.</p> <p>Equifax, a credit reference agency based in Atlanta, Georgia, is finding a lot of business in Latin America as internet usage spreads like wildfire in the region. Equifax is one the world's biggest providers of financial information and its Equifax Secure arm aims to ensure that net transactions are safe. </p> <p>Ian McKinnon, director or Equifax Secure in Europe, says Latin America is a growth area. \"Surprisingly, we are getting a lot of business in the region,\" he said. \"The fact that they don't have massive physical infrastructure is actually an advantage.\"</p> <p>Equifax Secure's experience in Latin America shows that the internet boom is not confined to the US and Europe. The two economic giants are far ahead of the rest of the world in internet usage, but the net is catching on fast in some developing countries. In Latin America, the number of internet users, currently estimated at 10.5m, is projected to rise to between 19m and 37m by 2003.</p> <p>While analysts may differ on the potential for e-commerce in Latin America, they agree on one thing: the region has a great advantage in its young population, which is where the internet can make the most impact. The Latin American population is much younger in Europe than those of the US, Europe or Japan. </p> <p>Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, the financial services group, believes that as it matures, Latin American youth is \"more likely to embrace the net for information, entertainment and shopping than their parents or grandparents\".</p> <p>The growth of e-commerce in Latin America faces many constraints. There are fewer PC-owners. The region lacks a sophisticated telecommunications infrastructure and it suffers from weak payment systems, a rickety postal system and low credit card use. </p> <p>But these are not necessarily insuperable barriers to the spread of e-commerce. Payments can be made through cash-on-delivery couriers, and prepaid telephone cards could be adapted for internet commerce. Internet kiosks in shops, cafes, universities and other public places could make up for the low number of PCs. The lack of PCs is no deterrent to net access, judging by the experience of China, where non-PC access methods are becoming increasingly popular. Personal digital assistants, mobile phones and television set-top boxes were used to get online by nearly 590,000 people as China experiences an internet boom similar to that of Latin America.</p> <p>Internet penetration continued to skyrocket in the first six months of this year. The number of people accessing the web rose to 16.9m, an increase of 8m since the start of the year, according to the China internet network information centre. More Chinese surfers now use the net to shop online, with 14% of users buying goods or services from internet retailers. </p> <p>No wonder the Chinese government looks to the internet as an engine for economic growth, although it is also nervous at the prospect of non-party views spreading through cyberspace like a virus. The People's Daily, the official Communist party newspaper, earlier this month warned that \"enemy forces at home and abroad are sparing no effort to use this battle to infiltrate us\".</p> <p>But while net use is accelerating rapidly in Latin America and Asia, that cannot be said of Africa, which had just 2.5m users as of June this year. That total is expected to increase to only 4.4m in 2003.</p> <p>A report compiled by African portal woyaa.com and Unesco, the UN agency on educational and cultural matters, said the number of sites in all African countries, apart from South Africa, is worryingly low. This is due to the dearth of appropriate equipment and infrastructure, the lack of regulation surrounding copyright and security issues, and the low level of awareness of the benefits of the net. </p> <p>South Africa had the most diverse sites and up-to-date content, followed by sites from Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia. Sites in sub-Saharan Africa had the most room for development.</p> <p>Woyaa and Unesco call for improved training schemes and awareness campaigns as well as higher visibility for African sites through listings on international search engines.</p> <p>Public sector institutions should also provide a \"good example\" to other groups by developing comprehensive and user-friendly sites, Woyaa and Unesco argue.</p> <p>Some international effort is being mounted to help developing countries get their act together. The International Telecommunications Union, a specialised UN agency for telecommunications, is seeking to develop e-commerce in the developing world through its Electronic Commerce for Developing Countries project. </p> <p>The venture encourages developing countries to use existing infrastructures and services to join the digital economy through partnerships with the private sector. But the \u00a31.7m it has at its disposal is puny.</p> <p>Even in Latin America, which shows considerable potential, a digital divide is emerging. Brazil, Argentina and Mexico comprise more than 80% of the region's 8m internet users, while Brazil accounts for 60% of e-commerce revenues alone.</p> <p>Policy makers in the developing world thus face a twin challenge. They have to try and keep up with the US and Europe, while making sure that their own domestic digital divides do not widen.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.woyaa.com/index.html\">Woyaa.com</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://asia.internet.com/\">Asia.internet.com</a></p> <p><a href=\"mailto:mark.tran@theguardian.com\"> mark.tran@theguardian.com</a></p>",

In Latin America, the number of internet users, currently estimated at 10.5m, is projected to rise to between 19m and 37m by 2003. While analysts may differ on the potential for e-commerce in Latin America, they agree on one thing: the region has a great advantage in its young population, which is where the internet can make the most impact. The Latin American population is much younger in Europe than those of the US, Europe or Japan. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, the financial services group, believes that as it matures, Latin American youth is \"more likely to embrace the net for information, entertainment and shopping than their parents or grandparents\". The growth of e-commerce in Latin America faces many constraints. There are fewer PC-owners. The region lacks a sophisticated telecommunications infrastructure and it suffers from weak payment systems, a rickety postal system and low credit card use. But these are not necessarily insuperable barriers to the spread of e-commerce. Payments can be made through cash-on-delivery couriers, and prepaid telephone cards could be adapted for internet commerce. Internet kiosks in shops, cafes, universities and other public places could make up for the low number of PCs. The lack of PCs is no deterrent to net access, judging by the experience of China, where non-PC access methods are becoming increasingly popular. Personal digital assistants, mobile phones and television set-top boxes were used to get online by nearly 590,000 people as China experiences an internet boom similar to that of Latin America. Internet penetration continued to skyrocket in the first six months of this year. The number of people accessing the web rose to 16.9m, an increase of 8m since the start of the year, according to the China internet network information centre. More Chinese surfers now use the net to shop online, with 14% of users buying goods or services from internet retailers. No wonder the Chinese government looks to the internet as an engine for economic growth, although it is also nervous at the prospect of non-party views spreading through cyberspace like a virus. The People's Daily, the official Communist party newspaper, earlier this month warned that \"enemy forces at home and abroad are sparing no effort to use this battle to infiltrate us\". But while net use is accelerating rapidly in Latin America and Asia, that cannot be said of Africa, which had just 2.5m users as of June this year. That total is expected to increase to only 4.4m in 2003. A report compiled by African portal woyaa.com and Unesco, the UN agency on educational and cultural matters, said the number of sites in all African countries, apart from South Africa, is worryingly low. This is due to the dearth of appropriate equipment and infrastructure, the lack of regulation surrounding copyright and security issues, and the low level of awareness of the benefits of the net. South Africa had the most diverse sites and up-to-date content, followed by sites from Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia. Sites in sub-Saharan Africa had the most room for development. Woyaa and Unesco call for improved training schemes and awareness campaigns as well as higher visibility for African sites through listings on international search engines. Public sector institutions should also provide a \"good example\" to other groups by developing comprehensive and user-friendly sites, Woyaa and Unesco argue. Some international effort is being mounted to help developing countries get their act together. The International Telecommunications Union, a specialised UN agency for telecommunications, is seeking to develop e-commerce in the developing world through its Electronic Commerce for Developing Countries project. The venture encourages developing countries to use existing infrastructures and services to join the digital economy through partnerships with the private sector. But the \u00a31.7m it has at its disposal is puny. Even in Latin America, which shows considerable potential, a digital divide is emerging. Brazil, Argentina and Mexico comprise more than 80% of the region's 8m internet users, while Brazil accounts for 60% of e-commerce revenues alone. Policy makers in the developing world thus face a twin challenge. They have to try and keep up with the US and Europe, while making sure that their own domestic digital divides do not widen.

      "trailText": "<p>The battle for broadband will only have one winner - the telephone companies </p>",
      "byline": "Imogen O'Rorke",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>While the majority of the population still can't see beyond the next episode of Big Brother, the powers behind our screens - the content providers, pipes and portals, all of whom hope to be dominant players in the brave new age of broadband - are falling over themselves trying to second guess our consumption habits in 2005. </p> <p>The analysts are forecasting a radical shake-up in the way we take our daily media. According to a recent Forrester report, European Broadband Takes Off, by 2003, 18% of northern European households (27m) will have increased bandwidth, the majority through phonelines and cable, but also through satellite or fibre optics. </p> <p>Penetration in Britain will be 20% by 2005. That means 20% of households will have an \"always on\" internet connection with vastly increased speeds for data transfer, interactivity and transactions. Yes, soon we will be able to video-conference with mother. </p> <p>At the moment, the only people using broadband are young, single and male - the types who went out and bought Wap straight away - but early tests conducted with families suggest that broadband will be a much bigger hit than conventional narrowband internet: 50% of us will spend 10 hours a week online, compared to 15% today, and research predicts that we will come to rely on it more and more for high-street services. </p> <p>Cable companies such as <a href=\"http://www.chello.com\">Chello </a> and <a href=\"http://www.casema.com\"> Casema</a> have been supplying broadband for three years and currently hold 85% of the still diminutive European market. To date, the physical limitations and cost of cable have put it out of most people's reach. </p> <p>But all this is about to change. Telecommunications companies are entering the European market with aggressive expansion plans and prices will come tumbling down. Last month, <a href=\"http://www.bt.co.uk\">BT </a> launched Openworld, targeting small businesses and consumers at \u00a339.99 a month. As early as 2001 it is promising \"personalised gateways\" to content and applications across a range of mobile and static devices. </p> <p>OrangeWorld's strategy, unveiled in July, will see headlines, sports, share prices and entertainment archives delivered through voice activation and eventually video. Despite the fact that full broadband mobile services are three years away, <a href=\"http://www.orange.com\"> Orange</a> is already selling the future phone as \"your personal communications centre\" and will be rolling out a video phone capable of 12 frames a second by the end of the year. </p> <p>The Forrester report's most contentious assumption is probably that the telecoms companies will win the battle for subscribers with broadband technology (taking 53% of the market), ending the cable companies' early movers' advantage and crushing independent ISPs such as <a href=\"http://www.freeserve.com\"> Freeserve</a> and <a href=\"http://www.libertysurf.com\"> Libertysurf</a>. </p> <p>These conclusions are based on simple facts of access: 95% of European households have phone lines as opposed to 36% with cable. As soon as the telecoms firms offer TV bundles at feasible prices, the report suggests, consumers will flock to the copper wires, where they will be effectively locked in to services. </p> <p>As telecoms companies are in a position to resell network capacity to third parties such as <a href=\"http://www.virgin.com\"> Virgin</a>, <a href=\"http://www.easyeverything.com\"> easyEverything</a> and the cable companies and ISPs themselves, they are in a win-win situation, a similar state to prelapsarian <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com\"> Microsoft</a>. </p> <p>\"The bottom line is, in order to succeed in this market, you need to be broadcasting across many devices: interactive TV, PC and mobile phone,\" says Lars Goldell, co-author of the report. Only the telecoms giants have the scale (broadband networks require astronomical investment), the scope (the ability to bundle services into a cross-platform package) and the brand (it needs to be as big as PG Tips for the public to allow it into their homes). Chello, he says, is \"not strong on the mobile front\", Freeserve won't succeed because \"in resources and scale they are far behind\" and independent ISPs \"have no future as stand-alone companies and need to find partnerships right away\". </p> <p>Evan Rudowski, who next month takes over as managing director (media) of Excite Chello, the newly announced merger between Europe's largest ISP and broadband company, dismisses the report's main claim because it was compiled before the marriage was announced. \"It's not just about positioning, it's about making effective use of that positioning. Chello and Excite between them have years of experience with two-way interactive services, content and applications development, and media revenues. The deepest experience of content the telephone companies have is the phone directory.\" </p> <p>He adds that his telecom rivals' track record with competitive pricing is not good - a recent survey found that Britons were only prepared to pay one third of the proposed charge for broadband services. </p> <p>As for scale, Excite Chello, recently valued at 5.5bn euros, is positioning itself to be the European proxy of Excite@Home, which has the lion's share of the broadband market in the US. It aims to reach 30m homes across 15 countries (and by the end of 2000, have 300,000 subscribers). It has secured 400m euros for immediate development until it is floated in six months' time. </p> <p>In terms of mobile scope, it already has a wireless service and an existing relationship with BT, which owns 43% of Excite UK's narrowband service, but is \"not adverse\" to the idea of a telecoms partnership. After the merger, Rudowski asserts, \"We are not settling for second rung. We have the lead right now - no one can match our subscriber base [nearly 4m] in Europe - and we don't intend to let anyone pass us.\" </p> <p>Freeserve also relies on the argument that the telecoms firms are \"dumb pipes\" with no feel for content. \"It is content that brings significant numbers of people to our site,\" says spokesman Steve Pang. \"Our strategy is to exploit our strong UK position, migrating our 2m subscribers to broadband.\" Hence the large sums invested in its entertainment channel. </p> <p> Meanwhile, the telecoms companies are going into overdrive, securing content partnerships and applications, acquiring start-ups. BT's content deals to date (in entertainment and sports) include the Cartoon Network, Popcorn, Carlton Online, Hollywood.com, Sundance Channel, Atom Films, Sportal, Sportinglife and Extreme Sports Channel, and also encompass news, travel, finance, human resources, food, business and commerce. Orange, with its new \u00a3300m venture-capital fund focusing on broadband, is going shopping in a big way. </p> <p>There will inevitably be losers, but it won't be the content providers if they are clever. Companies like Hat Trick KPE Interactive (HKI), a marriage between a traditional terrestrial production company and an interactive media incubator, have positioned themselves to service the pipes and portals from cable companies and telecoms right through to Channel 4's forthcoming interactive channel, E4. </p> <p>\"Everyone knows it's not just the distribution platform that wins but the programming that's on it,\" says Paul Zwillenberg, managing director of HKI. \"Whether you're Freeserve, AOL or BT, your entire business is relying on subscribers' loyalty.\" HKI has a team of 10 creatives working on what it terms the \"next generation of programming\"; three-minute cartoon \"webisodes\", for example, or a fully interactive Have I Got News For You. </p> <p>Zwillenberg believes there will be room for all the big players. \"Basically, if you are a BT, an Excite Chello, a Sky, Telewest, AOL or Freeserve you are fine; if you are not, you don't have a hope in hell.\" </p> <p>According to the estimates, by 2004 a group of five broadband giants will be emerging which will make Microsoft seem like small fry. Subscriber-based services will dominate (you can forget a free broadband internet); two thirds of mobile internet users will also be accessing them through a PC and interactive TV; and two-way data flow will be so smooth that homes will have to fit personal firewalls for security purposes. The real Big Brother is only a whistle away - just don't set your video recorders yet.</p>",

      "bodyText": "While the majority of the population still can't see beyond the next episode of Big Brother, the powers behind our screens - the content providers, pipes and portals, all of whom hope to be dominant players in the brave new age of broadband - are falling over themselves trying to second guess our consumption habits in 2005. The analysts are forecasting a radical shake-up in the way we take our daily media. According to a recent Forrester report, European Broadband Takes Off, by 2003, 18% of northern European households (27m) will have increased bandwidth, the majority through phonelines and cable, but also through satellite or fibre optics. Penetration in Britain will be 20% by 2005. That means 20% of households will have an \"always on\" internet connection with vastly increased speeds for data transfer, interactivity and transactions. Yes, soon we will be able to video-conference with mother. At the moment, the only people using broadband are young, single and male - the types who went out and bought Wap straight away - but early tests conducted with families suggest that broadband will be a much bigger hit than conventional narrowband internet: 50% of us will spend 10 hours a week online, compared to 15% today, and research predicts that we will come to rely on it more and more for high-street services. Cable companies such as Chello and Casema have been supplying broadband for three years and currently hold 85% of the still diminutive European market. To date, the physical limitations and cost of cable have put it out of most people's reach. But all this is about to change. Telecommunications companies are entering the European market with aggressive expansion plans and prices will come tumbling down. Last month, BT launched Openworld, targeting small businesses and consumers at \u00a339.99 a month. As early as 2001 it is promising \"personalised gateways\" to content and applications across a range of mobile and static devices. OrangeWorld's strategy, unveiled in July, will see headlines, sports, share prices and entertainment archives delivered through voice activation and eventually video. Despite the fact that full broadband mobile services are three years away, Orange is already selling the future phone as \"your personal communications centre\" and will be rolling out a video phone capable of 12 frames a second by the end of the year. The Forrester report's most contentious assumption is probably that the telecoms companies will win the battle for subscribers with broadband technology (taking 53% of the market), ending the cable companies' early movers' advantage and crushing independent ISPs such as Freeserve and Libertysurf. These conclusions are based on simple facts of access: 95% of European households have phone lines as opposed to 36% with cable. As soon as the telecoms firms offer TV bundles at feasible prices, the report suggests, consumers will flock to the copper wires, where they will be effectively locked in to services. As telecoms companies are in a position to resell network capacity to third parties such as Virgin, easyEverything and the cable companies and ISPs themselves, they are in a win-win situation, a similar state to prelapsarian Microsoft. \"The bottom line is, in order to succeed in this market, you need to be broadcasting across many devices: interactive TV, PC and mobile phone,\" says Lars Goldell, co-author of the report. Only the telecoms giants have the scale (broadband networks require astronomical investment), the scope (the ability to bundle services into a cross-platform package) and the brand (it needs to be as big as PG Tips for the public to allow it into their homes). Chello, he says, is \"not strong on the mobile front\", Freeserve won't succeed because \"in resources and scale they are far behind\" and independent ISPs \"have no future as stand-alone companies and need to find partnerships right away\". Evan Rudowski, who next month takes over as managing director (media) of Excite Chello, the newly announced merger between Europe's largest ISP and broadband company, dismisses the report's main claim because it was compiled before the marriage was announced. \"It's not just about positioning, it's about making effective use of that positioning. Chello and Excite between them have years of experience with two-way interactive services, content and applications development, and media revenues. The deepest experience of content the telephone companies have is the phone directory.\" He adds that his telecom rivals' track record with competitive pricing is not good - a recent survey found that Britons were only prepared to pay one third of the proposed charge for broadband services. As for scale, Excite Chello, recently valued at 5.5bn euros, is positioning itself to be the European proxy of Excite@Home, which has the lion's share of the broadband market in the US. It aims to reach 30m homes across 15 countries (and by the end of 2000, have 300,000 subscribers). It has secured 400m euros for immediate development until it is floated in six months' time. In terms of mobile scope, it already has a wireless service and an existing relationship with BT, which owns 43% of Excite UK's narrowband service, but is \"not adverse\" to the idea of a telecoms partnership. After the merger, Rudowski asserts, \"We are not settling for second rung. We have the lead right now - no one can match our subscriber base [nearly 4m] in Europe - and we don't intend to let anyone pass us.\" Freeserve also relies on the argument that the telecoms firms are \"dumb pipes\" with no feel for content. \"It is content that brings significant numbers of people to our site,\" says spokesman Steve Pang. \"Our strategy is to exploit our strong UK position, migrating our 2m subscribers to broadband.\" Hence the large sums invested in its entertainment channel. Meanwhile, the telecoms companies are going into overdrive, securing content partnerships and applications, acquiring start-ups. BT's content deals to date (in entertainment and sports) include the Cartoon Network, Popcorn, Carlton Online, Hollywood.com, Sundance Channel, Atom Films, Sportal, Sportinglife and Extreme Sports Channel, and also encompass news, travel, finance, human resources, food, business and commerce. Orange, with its new \u00a3300m venture-capital fund focusing on broadband, is going shopping in a big way. There will inevitably be losers, but it won't be the content providers if they are clever. Companies like Hat Trick KPE Interactive (HKI), a marriage between a traditional terrestrial production company and an interactive media incubator, have positioned themselves to service the pipes and portals from cable companies and telecoms right through to Channel 4's forthcoming interactive channel, E4. \"Everyone knows it's not just the distribution platform that wins but the programming that's on it,\" says Paul Zwillenberg, managing director of HKI. \"Whether you're Freeserve, AOL or BT, your entire business is relying on subscribers' loyalty.\" HKI has a team of 10 creatives working on what it terms the \"next generation of programming\"; three-minute cartoon \"webisodes\", for example, or a fully interactive Have I Got News For You. Zwillenberg believes there will be room for all the big players. \"Basically, if you are a BT, an Excite Chello, a Sky, Telewest, AOL or Freeserve you are fine; if you are not, you don't have a hope in hell.\" According to the estimates, by 2004 a group of five broadband giants will be emerging which will make Microsoft seem like small fry. Subscriber-based services will dominate (you can forget a free broadband internet); two thirds of mobile internet users will also be accessing them through a PC and interactive TV; and two-way data flow will be so smooth that homes will have to fit personal firewalls for security purposes. The real Big Brother is only a whistle away - just don't set your video recorders yet.",

In spite of all sorts of massaging - price-cutting, bulk giveaways, cut-price subscriptions - there are many more minuses than pluses. In the six months from February to July, the 10 London-based national dailies sold an average of 12.72m copies, compared to 12.89m over the same period a year ago, 12.97m in 1998 and 13.21m in 1997.

It is to be hoped that Hollick hasn't learned the wrong lesson from the Daily Star's excellent sales figures in the last couple of months. It has managed to turn itself around on a shoestring, with the smallest editorial staff and an absence of promotion. If he thinks the Daily Express, not to mention its poorly performing Sunday stablemate, would benefit from a further starvation of resources he will be in for a shock. However well the Star has done, its success is modest and no journalist working for it believes it has benefited from United's strategy. </p> <p>The two Independent titles are also finding it tough going, but their owner is in it for the long haul and shows no sign of raising the white flag just yet. Instead, we might ponder the fate of the Telegraph pair. It is difficult to understand what owner Conrad Black is up to nowadays. He has sold off titles in North America and has hinted about buying a provincial group, Regional Independent Media, here. His lordship-in-waiting can't be making a fortune from the Daily and Sunday Telegraph, given the subscription deals offered to readers: only 570,000 people pay full rate for the daily, while a mere 265,000 do so for the Sunday. Some 50,000 Daily Telegraphs are given away on planes and in hotels. Could Black be the first to crack when the cold wind blows? </p> <p>Incidentally, the decline of the Sunday circulations is even worse than that of the dailies. Using the same criteria as before, in four years the six-monthly average of the nine London-based titles has dived from 14.85m to 13.57m, a fall of more than 8.5%. </p> <p>Some papers are, of course, performing well, but the overall trend is clear and the dangers are obvious. When the bad times arrive, cost-cutting is also much more difficult to achieve in nationals than in regionals, which are solving the problem through consolidation. </p> <p>The regional industry's energetic and far-sighted mouthpiece, the Newspaper Society, is now calling for a radical overhaul of the current ownership regulations and the termination of specialist media controls to ensure that more mergers and acquisitions can occur. Rules largely drawn up in the 1960s are now considered to be totally inappropriate, according to Tim Bowdler, chief executive of Johnston Press, the fourth largest regional group. He argues, somewhat unconvincingly in my view, that the threat to the regional press from \"the new media\" makes it imperative that the government dispense with all regulation. He and his fellow owners (though not, it must be said, the smaller ones) have been supported by a Nera report which recommends that newspapers should be subject simply to general competition law. </p> <p>There are sensible changes suggested by Nera, such as some relaxation of cross-media ownership regulations. And to allow a complete free-for-all, treating papers like soap powder or baked beans and ignoring the special public interest reasons for producing newspapers, may be fine for those who believe the industry is all about making money, but it's surely against the desires of those of us who wish to enjoy continuing diversity. Logical, if ruthless, demands by shareholders for higher profit margins are inimical to the demands by readers and advertisers for choice in the marketplace. As consolidation moves forward, it is already the case that the largest 20 regional press publishers now own 84% of all titles and account for 95% of total weekly circulation. These are not bad companies and their senior executives are sincere in their belief that the benefits of size enable them to produce better quality papers. But the good in this generation may well not carry over to the next. </p> <p>Size, and the power it provides, is not always conducive to the public good, nor to the health of newspapers. A putative deal between two giants - Tesco supermarkets and WHSmith, the newspaper wholesaler - threatens to rob people of the opportunity of obtaining their morning paper. If the deal goes ahead, WHSmith will exclusively distribute magazines to all Tesco stores, overturning the current way in which 102 wholesalers across Britain distribute papers on a regional basis, a system which serves the best interests of buyers because they can pick up a paper at their local newsagent. </p> <p>It is feared that such an agreement would be followed by other supermarkets and then be extended to newspapers too. By choosing a single national wholesaler, the likely result would be a closure of hundreds of little newsagents. That, in turn, would mean people have to go to a supermarket for a paper and would also threaten home delivery services. This would threaten circulations still further, turning that gentle downward drift into a spiral. It's possible to see the Tesco-WHSmith plan as the natural next step in the erosion of the corner shop, an understandable development of that economic system newspaper owners all applaud.

On his 18th birthday William Hague knocked back 32 rum and Cokes \"and was still standing\", according to a teenage chum from the South Yorkshire pubs of his youth.</p> <p>The revelation in yesterday's Mail on Sunday came after five days of controversy over the Conservative leader's claim to have drunk up to 14 pints a day while delivering beer in and around his native Wentworth.</p> <p>Like many political controversies it has split the nation between those who believe the claims, those who don't and those who deplore them, whether true or false. The Labour party is in the last two camps.</p> <p>Yesterday's revelation that Mr Hague had a sideline in spirit drinking should have lowered Labour morale. Since Wednesday the party summer campaigns team has produced a campaign beer mat, unveiled by John Prescott, deputy prime minister, on BBC1's Breakfast with Frost yesterday.</p> <p>On one side the beer mat lists what Labour has done for the NHS, specifically in modernising the accident and emergency unit at Northallerton in Mr Hague's Richmond constituency. On the other side it simply says \"Tory Froth\" besides a foaming pint. Labour hopes to link the image to the spending cuts it believes Mr Hague would have to make if he wants tax cuts in the next parliament - \u00a324m in every constituency.</p> <p>But the latest claim that Mr Hague also drank shorts, made by his old school friend, David Rusby - an audio engineer who still lives in Wentworth where young William staggered into manhood - threatens Millbank's beer mat strategy aimed at traditional heartland voters.</p> <p>Last night Labour hit back with a pledge to pursue Mr Hague into the spirit-drinking saloon bars of Middle England. \"We are going to move into the middle class range as soon as we can, cocktail napkins and swizzle sticks,\" all carrying a similar message, a party spokesman promised.</p> <p>Hague aides are delighted that the row has presented their man as not just a bookish nerd. The party chairman, Michael Ancram, explained yesterday: \"People asked was he always with his head in political books and Hansard, and he was saying he had a broader, wider life than that.\"</p> <p>But a Home Office minister, Lord Bassam, took a more censorious view of \"laddishness\" at a time when people like himself are trying to curb alcohol-related violence.</p> <p>\"The thing about 14 pints of lager or 32 rum and Cokes or whatever, it seems to me to be somewhat at odds at a time when we are trying to discourage abuse of alcohol which clearly leads to violence on the streets when it comes to football,\" he told Radio 5 Live.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Fourteen pints of beer a day? That were nothing, lad. On his 18th birthday William Hague knocked back 32 rum and Cokes \"and was still standing\", according to a teenage chum from the South Yorkshire pubs of his youth. The revelation in yesterday's Mail on Sunday came after five days of controversy over the Conservative leader's claim to have drunk up to 14 pints a day while delivering beer in and around his native Wentworth. Like many political controversies it has split the nation between those who believe the claims, those who don't and those who deplore them, whether true or false. The Labour party is in the last two camps. Yesterday's revelation that Mr Hague had a sideline in spirit drinking should have lowered Labour morale. Since Wednesday the party summer campaigns team has produced a campaign beer mat, unveiled by John Prescott, deputy prime minister, on BBC1's Breakfast with Frost yesterday. On one side the beer mat lists what Labour has done for the NHS, specifically in modernising the accident and emergency unit at Northallerton in Mr Hague's Richmond constituency. On the other side it simply says \"Tory Froth\" besides a foaming pint. Labour hopes to link the image to the spending cuts it believes Mr Hague would have to make if he wants tax cuts in the next parliament - \u00a324m in every constituency. But the latest claim that Mr Hague also drank shorts, made by his old school friend, David Rusby - an audio engineer who still lives in Wentworth where young William staggered into manhood - threatens Millbank's beer mat strategy aimed at traditional heartland voters. Last night Labour hit back with a pledge to pursue Mr Hague into the spirit-drinking saloon bars of Middle England. \"We are going to move into the middle class range as soon as we can, cocktail napkins and swizzle sticks,\" all carrying a similar message, a party spokesman promised. Hague aides are delighted that the row has presented their man as not just a bookish nerd. The party chairman, Michael Ancram, explained yesterday: \"People asked was he always with his head in political books and Hansard, and he was saying he had a broader, wider life than that.\" But a Home Office minister, Lord Bassam, took a more censorious view of \"laddishness\" at a time when people like himself are trying to curb alcohol-related violence. \"The thing about 14 pints of lager or 32 rum and Cokes or whatever, it seems to me to be somewhat at odds at a time when we are trying to discourage abuse of alcohol which clearly leads to violence on the streets when it comes to football,\" he told Radio 5 Live.",

The acknowledgement came as the government was criticised by rights groups at a UN meeting in Geneva to discuss racial discrimination.</p> <p>Britain \"remains attractive to migrants precisely because it is seen as a tolerant and diverse society,\" delegation leader Sarah Marshall told the 18-member committee on the elimination of racial discrimination.</p> <p>She noted that Britain received 71,160 asylum applications last year, up 55% on the previous year.

The acknowledgement came as the government was criticised by rights groups at a UN meeting in Geneva to discuss racial discrimination. Britain \"remains attractive to migrants precisely because it is seen as a tolerant and diverse society,\" delegation leader Sarah Marshall told the 18-member committee on the elimination of racial discrimination. She noted that Britain received 71,160 asylum applications last year, up 55% on the previous year. Although the government has tightened asylum policies, the Conservatives have attacked Labour for making Britain a \"soft touch\" for migrants and called for asylum-seekers to be put in detention centres. \"Effective immigration control systems remain the crucial platform from which more positive policies can be considered,\" Ms Marshall said, adding that Britain is working toward a more pro-active policy to integrate refugees.

You can even download a copy for your Palm organiser and beam it to friends (well, in theory, as I've crashed two people's Palm Vs trying it).

      "body": "<p>Michelle is taking vicious swipes at my bob. It's coming off, you see, for summer. Gold chains sway over her Corfu-tanned cleavage, her fuchsia nails clench her scissors, her lips are pursed in concentration. She is doing this in my bathroom, but we do not know each other: she lives down my street and offered her services the other day.</p> <p>Eventually, she says: \"You going on your summer holidays, then?\"</p> <p>Since she's asking, I tell her. \"No I'm not. It's August - I'm staying home.\"</p> <p>Michelle glances at me in the mirror, the sort of glance you might give a nun in a whorehouse. What a weirdo, she thinks. Fancy no summer holiday! I 'fess up - I'm a city girl. Yes, yes, I drink vodka, keep a cat, ravage men and fight chocolate urges - all that. I marvel at Top Shop (\"Tow Show\" to those in the know), I have 15 different types of aromatherapy massage oil in my bathroom cupboard (which never get used), a very long telephone bill and a penchant for facials. But also ... I don't want to go away for a summer holiday.</p> <p>I like the city too much at this time of year. Make all the assumptions you like about Mediterranean romances after copious bottles of wine, but me, I prefer to stay home in the summer. Why exactly shouldn't I, when the rest of this country's rain-soaked months are enough to drive you out, when September to July provide weeks of potential escapism, hundreds of days to take refuge from the monotonous drizzle that dominates our skyline?</p> <p>August, though. August is different. Nights are hot, balmy, sticky; but in the city they are also cool, breezy, edgy. In the country you hear birds, water, crickets, breeze. In the city you hear beats, conversation, the fizz of cans opening, shouts from garden patios, laughter with a stranger. Yes! Spontaneous human contact!</p> <p>August is the one month when London is actually worth living in, when Mr and Mrs Volvo have gone to their country pad, the bourgeoisie have fled to Tuscany and the politicians are back in their constituencies. And left behind, playing down my street - my sweet, north London, pastel-fronted street, with its limestone flagging and punctuated trees - are my neighbours, the people I live among but only actually know for one month of the year.</p> <p>August is when the city's million residential enclaves peel back their T-shirts and bare their skin, when curtains flap indoor conversation on to the street, when open doors waft inhabitants outside, and we all get to see what everybody else is made of. August is when the city cul-de-sacs become Ramsay Streets, when residents stop and pass the time of day, and, as afternoon turns to evening, neighbours peer over garden fences to apologise for their barbecue smoke and teatime customers stop to chat in corner shops.</p> <p>Turkish Ali, my corner-shop owner, gets a brief reprieve from his broken heart at this time of year. The bitch at number 59 led him a merry dance for three years, he says, until she moved another lover in - the same lover to whom Ali now gives pints of semi-skimmed on tick, then moans about to three cooing writers who hang out round his store during non-creative moments. They shake their heads in sympathy and squabble over which one gets his story.</p> <p>Norman, the old gent at number 23, also blooms at the back ends of August days, able to stand out on his doorstep, hands folded behind his back, flat cap still firmly wedged on, although his shirt is open, showing his white, wrinkled belly.</p> <p>Now he can nod and smile at every passer-by, instead of staring forlornly from behind his rain-flecked windowpane, trapped in his armchair, condemned to his front room. Anjelica the Croatian refugee, who simultaneously married her English teacher and - without knowing it - Arsenal FC, doesn't just walk straight past Norman today. Instead she stops, smiles and nods as his jolly gums open and close and she struggles to make sense of what he says. On her face is a look of wonder as her first city summer reveals its true colours. Across the road from her, Curtis, the DJ in a wheelchair, is blasting two-step across the pavement, the bass line making the parked cars vibrate. But Curtis has some competition, for Maggiore, the amateur opera singer, can be heard doing her warm-up exercises.</p> <p>Glad of an audience after all these years of obscurity, she fills the street with scales and octaves. Her living-room sash is pulled right up so that we can admire the red velvet cloak draped over her generous limbs, her hair piled majestically on top of her head, while upstairs from her Nick and Ash, the throwback punk couple with their mangy pitbull, Arthur, lean out of the window for a better look.</p> <p>Nick is the son of a famous mountain climber, Ash the daughter of a hippy squat that went wrong. With them lives Sid, whose lined face is framed with shocking pink hair (Sid, you are too old for it), and whose tiny son rarely lets go of his hand.</p> <p>Sid worships Maggiore, and sometimes sits transfixed, cross-legged in front of her window. His son sucks his thumb and watches the older woman's warbling throat, its flesh vibrating like a turkey's neck.</p> <p>Now it is Rita and Susie's turn to step into the limelight as the August shadows reluctantly lengthen. This hefty couple, with their whippets Lil and Let (really), sit on the curb sipping from Ali's ice-cold cans of Carling, petting each other and inspecting their latest tattoos. Craig, Jesse and Jim are having a kickabout, still demob-happy halfway through their long summer holidays, baggy T-shirts hanging around their knees, baseball caps rammed down over their scheming heads, chortling naughtily every time the ball hits a car window. And as dusk settles, Xandra (\"That's Xandra with an X\") and Austin in next door's garden clink glasses with their friends, knives scraping plates as they slice the buffalo mozzarella, candles flickering, gladioli bowing down over their table so I can't quite see their faces.</p> <p>What might they be up to? Is Austin rolling a joint? My usual guess is that he must be, and not the first one of the night, either. Their conversation, which starts off muted, polite, and kissy-kissy, becomes raucous, screaming, guffawing and Austin makes everyone - me included - laugh by falling off his chair.</p> <p>As the August night deepens, I hear my local ring last orders and listen through my open windows as the punters trip out, talking louder than they need to. Later still, the Latin couple upstairs start rowing again, each new insult hurtling into my bedroom. Soon they are crashing around so violently that my phone is in my hand, my finger poised over the number nine as the sound of shattering glass crashes through the equanimity of the street, and I think: \"That's it, that's trouble.\"</p> <p>And suddenly, all I can hear is hysterical laughter as they make up for the umpteenth time - at three o'clock in the morning. I put my phone back down, and wonder if I'll need to press the nine next time.</p> <p>These are the things I know about the people on my street. But what do they know about me? During the rest of the year, nothing at all. They might see me traipsing to work in the grey hours of winter mornings, or stumbling back late at night, dropping my cab fare all over the road. They probably call me Bridget, and snigger when I buy chardonnay from Ali. Do they tut when they see my mascara has run, thinking it's a tryst turned tearful? Do they think I'm on the edge of reason?</p> <p>At any other time of year, if I dropped dead of a heart attack in the middle of the street, only the rag-and-bone man would come along to fetch me. But if it happened now, on an August night, things might be different. In August we see each other, we look rather than peek, we smile in the corner shop rather than scowl, we make way for each other rather than pushing past.</p> <p>Michelle, with her Corfu cleavage and her fuchsia nails, knows about me now - and what a weirdo I am. She'll tell number 62, who'll tell number 48, and then it will get back to Ali who will - for one month only - make sure everyone knows who I am.</p> <p>\u0095 This series continues next Monday. Tiffanie Darke's novel, Marrow, is published by Simon &amp; Schuster, priced \u00a35.99.</p>",

Sid worships Maggiore, and sometimes sits transfixed, cross-legged in front of her window. His son sucks his thumb and watches the older woman's warbling throat, its flesh vibrating like a turkey's neck. Now it is Rita and Susie's turn to step into the limelight as the August shadows reluctantly lengthen. This hefty couple, with their whippets Lil and Let (really), sit on the curb sipping from Ali's ice-cold cans of Carling, petting each other and inspecting their latest tattoos. Craig, Jesse and Jim are having a kickabout, still demob-happy halfway through their long summer holidays, baggy T-shirts hanging around their knees, baseball caps rammed down over their scheming heads, chortling naughtily every time the ball hits a car window. And as dusk settles, Xandra (\"That's Xandra with an X\") and Austin in next door's garden clink glasses with their friends, knives scraping plates as they slice the buffalo mozzarella, candles flickering, gladioli bowing down over their table so I can't quite see their faces. What might they be up to? Is Austin rolling a joint? My usual guess is that he must be, and not the first one of the night, either. Their conversation, which starts off muted, polite, and kissy-kissy, becomes raucous, screaming, guffawing and Austin makes everyone - me included - laugh by falling off his chair. As the August night deepens, I hear my local ring last orders and listen through my open windows as the punters trip out, talking louder than they need to. Later still, the Latin couple upstairs start rowing again, each new insult hurtling into my bedroom. Soon they are crashing around so violently that my phone is in my hand, my finger poised over the number nine as the sound of shattering glass crashes through the equanimity of the street, and I think: \"That's it, that's trouble.\" And suddenly, all I can hear is hysterical laughter as they make up for the umpteenth time - at three o'clock in the morning. I put my phone back down, and wonder if I'll need to press the nine next time. These are the things I know about the people on my street. But what do they know about me? During the rest of the year, nothing at all. They might see me traipsing to work in the grey hours of winter mornings, or stumbling back late at night, dropping my cab fare all over the road. They probably call me Bridget, and snigger when I buy chardonnay from Ali. Do they tut when they see my mascara has run, thinking it's a tryst turned tearful? Do they think I'm on the edge of reason? At any other time of year, if I dropped dead of a heart attack in the middle of the street, only the rag-and-bone man would come along to fetch me. But if it happened now, on an August night, things might be different. In August we see each other, we look rather than peek, we smile in the corner shop rather than scowl, we make way for each other rather than pushing past. Michelle, with her Corfu cleavage and her fuchsia nails, knows about me now - and what a weirdo I am. She'll tell number 62, who'll tell number 48, and then it will get back to Ali who will - for one month only - make sure everyone knows who I am. \u0095 This series continues next Monday. Tiffanie Darke's novel, Marrow, is published by Simon &amp; Schuster, priced \u00a35.99.",

Sheffield Wednesday's new manager saw his goalkeeper Kevin Pressman sent off after only 13 seconds and it was a minor miracle that his big day ended in a back-slapping scrum. </p> <p>Pressman's ignominy earns him a place in the record books for the fastest dismissal in English football, erasing Mark Smith's 19 seconds for Crewe Alexandra six years ago but lagging behind the world-record 10 seconds set by Bologna's Giuseppe Lorenzo in 1990. </p> <p>Last season such a setback would have been the excuse Wednesday's players needed to roll over and accept defeat. But on this evidence Jewell has clearly instilled some of the battling qualities that served Bradford City so well during his tenure in west Yorkshire. </p> <p>After Temuri Ketsbaia had given Wolves an 18th-minute lead with a scorching goal on his debut and, despite some frenetic home pressure, it was a fair assumption that things could only get better for Jewell. Sure enough, Wednesday's defiance was rewarded by Andy Booth's equaliser 11 minutes from time. </p> <p>\"I could never have dreamed of a start like that,\" said Jewell. \"It was unbelievable - welcome to Sheffield Wednesday. The game-plan went out of the window inside 30 seconds but the way we bounced back was a credit to everyone.\" </p> <p>Normal Wednesday service seemed to have been resumed when Pressman charged out of his area to block Ketsbaia's shot, allegedly with his hands, after the Georgian broke clear. </p> <p>The dismissal by Mark Halsey was inevitable though Pressman protested his innocence, saying he would appeal. \"The ball hit me on the chest and I've got the mark on my shirt to prove it. I may have made a bit of history but I'm not particularly proud of it.\" </p> <p>With Pavel Srnicek recently sold to Brescia, Jewell's only goalkeeping cover was Chris Stringer, a 17-year-old Sheffield product making his first appearance on the bench. </p> <p>The teenager was introduced for Richard Cresswell and, although there were a few butterflies, there was little he could do prevent Wolves taking a deserved lead. </p> <p>Ketsbaia - \"the Harry Hill of Molineux,\" according to the local Pink - should flourish on a lower tier after his \u00a3900,000 move from Newcastle. His 20-yard drive into the top right-hand corner was clocked by Sky at 87mph and he was hard done by when he rifled in a deflected free-kick soon afterwards only for Halsey to order a re-take, moving the kick 10 yards forward, because of encroachment at the original effort. </p> <p>On the day that the Wolves manager Colin Lee agreed a one-year extension to his contract, everything was going swimmingly for the home side. But they paid a heavy price for their profligacy, Booth heading in Wim Jonk's corner at the near post to salvage an improbable Wednesday point.</p>",

      "bodyText": "If there is such a thing as beginner's luck, Paul Jewell will be wondering what happened to his share yesterday. Sheffield Wednesday's new manager saw his goalkeeper Kevin Pressman sent off after only 13 seconds and it was a minor miracle that his big day ended in a back-slapping scrum. Pressman's ignominy earns him a place in the record books for the fastest dismissal in English football, erasing Mark Smith's 19 seconds for Crewe Alexandra six years ago but lagging behind the world-record 10 seconds set by Bologna's Giuseppe Lorenzo in 1990. Last season such a setback would have been the excuse Wednesday's players needed to roll over and accept defeat. But on this evidence Jewell has clearly instilled some of the battling qualities that served Bradford City so well during his tenure in west Yorkshire. After Temuri Ketsbaia had given Wolves an 18th-minute lead with a scorching goal on his debut and, despite some frenetic home pressure, it was a fair assumption that things could only get better for Jewell. Sure enough, Wednesday's defiance was rewarded by Andy Booth's equaliser 11 minutes from time. \"I could never have dreamed of a start like that,\" said Jewell. \"It was unbelievable - welcome to Sheffield Wednesday. The game-plan went out of the window inside 30 seconds but the way we bounced back was a credit to everyone.\" Normal Wednesday service seemed to have been resumed when Pressman charged out of his area to block Ketsbaia's shot, allegedly with his hands, after the Georgian broke clear. The dismissal by Mark Halsey was inevitable though Pressman protested his innocence, saying he would appeal. \"The ball hit me on the chest and I've got the mark on my shirt to prove it. I may have made a bit of history but I'm not particularly proud of it.\" With Pavel Srnicek recently sold to Brescia, Jewell's only goalkeeping cover was Chris Stringer, a 17-year-old Sheffield product making his first appearance on the bench. The teenager was introduced for Richard Cresswell and, although there were a few butterflies, there was little he could do prevent Wolves taking a deserved lead. Ketsbaia - \"the Harry Hill of Molineux,\" according to the local Pink - should flourish on a lower tier after his \u00a3900,000 move from Newcastle. His 20-yard drive into the top right-hand corner was clocked by Sky at 87mph and he was hard done by when he rifled in a deflected free-kick soon afterwards only for Halsey to order a re-take, moving the kick 10 yards forward, because of encroachment at the original effort. On the day that the Wolves manager Colin Lee agreed a one-year extension to his contract, everything was going swimmingly for the home side. But they paid a heavy price for their profligacy, Booth heading in Wim Jonk's corner at the near post to salvage an improbable Wednesday point.",

      "body": "<p>Joel and Ethan Coen first approached George Clooney with the script for O Brother, Where Art Thou? while he was in Phoenix working on Three Kings. \"I was nearing the end of a very tough five-month shoot, really ready to go home, and Joel and Ethan flew into Phoenix and handed me the script,\" recalled Clooney. \"They told me they'd written it with me in mind and asked me if I'd do it. I said yes without even reading the first page.\" </p> <p>Clooney had just ended his five-year run on ER to concentrate on a film career and was amazed the Coens had thought of him. Of their directing style he says: \"You think they're both going to direct at the same time. Then you discover they don't direct you a lot. They'll come over and say, 'Yeah, um, let's do it again. Yeah, you know. Yeah.' They play dumb a little, but they let you figure it out. In the morning you get the storyboard, so you know how it'll look. They're open to trying things, and you can suggest things and they say, 'OK, you can try that,' but they've already covered all the bases.\" </p> <p>The filming took place all over Mississippi and was followed by studio work in Los Angeles. It was completed in October 1999. </p> <p>When the Coens first talked to director of photography Roger Deakins about the movie, they explained that they wanted it to look \"brown and dirty and golden, like a period picture book of the Depression\". But when Deakins was told that the film was being shot in Mississippi, he pointed out that it was \"one of the greenest parts of the States\". So, to get the look that the brothers were after, the whole movie was digitised in order to take the green out of it. \"We gave it an ochre feel,\" said Deakins. \"I kept having to say to them: 'Just imagine it'll be all yellow.' \" </p> <p><strong> Scene 1: The chain gang</strong><br> </p> <p>The Coens are preparing the film's opening shot. It is of a chain gang of black convicts in faded striped uniforms, swinging picks in unison against rocks at the side of a road in the middle of the flat Mississippi Delta countryside. They chant Po' Lazarus as they work in the noon sun. </p> <p>A few miles from the location, scores of black extras are clustered in a tent in leg irons. Some are drinking Cokes, others are sitting patiently as a make-up woman smears them with \"sweat\" and \"dirt\". A few of them walk over to look at the storyboard titled Po' Lazarus Boys. Then a signal is given for all the extras to get up and file out on to a coach that is to take them to the location. </p> <p>The men arrive at the location. It is on a levee on the delta in about 100-degree heat. The production managers have to try to keep 200 people from dehydrating. There are little canopies to protect many of the crew from the sun. Ethan and Joel are wearing straw hats and sunglasses. Joel is wearing a grey T-shirt and shorts. Sweat is staining their shirts. They look along the line of extras like prison warders. There is a man with a gun on a horse patrolling the chain gang. </p> <p>Joel briefly explains to the convicts what they're going to do. The assistant director shouts, \"Playback!\" and the singing of Po' Lazarus fills the air, as the extras swing their picks, mouthing the words. Joel watches impassively. Roger Deakins, in a black fedora, dollies along beside them on a special track built for the camera. </p> <p>The assistant director shouts: \"Cut!\" The extras are handed water bottles to slake their thirst. Then the water bottles are taken away and they line up again to break rocks. Ethan grins to himself and strokes his ginger beard. He rarely speaks. The playback of the song, as well as the sound of rocks being hammered, starts up again. The picks swing in rhythm. </p> <p>Before the next take, Joel tells them: \"The rhythm really has to be on.\" \"OK, chain gang, one more time,\" shouts the assistant director. Nobody believes the \"one more time\". Suddenly she notices they are missing a convict. \"There's a hole in the line. We have an escapee,\" she laughs. \"Go without him for this take,\" says Joel. </p> <p>Everybody is drinking a lot of water out of plastic cups. While a crane shot is being prepared, Joel sits down in the shade on his director's chair, which is beside Ethan's, both of which are marked with their names and the title of the movie. Ethan takes over the direction for a while or, at least, he is indicating to some of the extras where to move. </p> <p>After another take, the assistant director shouts to the \"prisoners\": \"You can sit down if you want. We'll bring you water.\" Ethan, Joel and Roger Deakins watch the rushes on the monitor and laugh a lot. </p> <p><strong> Scene 2: The escape</strong></p> <p>The cock-eyed caravan moves on. There are wheatfields on either side of the road on the way to the next location. Sunflowers stare up at the blue sky. The team arrives at a burnt-out forest area. The scene, about 10 minutes into the film, takes place outside a lone farmhouse. Everett (George Clooney), Pete (John Turturro) and Delmar (Tim Nelson), chained together, are advancing on the farmhouse, which belongs to Pete's cousin, Wash Hogwallop. \"If your cousin still runs this-here horse farm and has a forge and some shoein' impedimenta to restore our liberty of movement\" says Everett, before a rifle shot rings out. On the porch is a grimy-faced boy, about eight years old, in tattered overalls, holding a gun almost as big as he is. \"Hold it rah chair!\" he shouts. \"You men from the bank? Daddy told me I'm to shoot whosoever from the bank!\" The trio convinces the boy, who turns out to be Wash Hogwallop's son, they're not from the bank. </p> <p>The team is gathered outside the farmhouse. Ethan is wearing the same shirt as yesterday, or rather it has the same pattern. He has a neat haircut and trimmed beard. Joel's beard and hair are unkempt, but he has changed into a clean shirt. Clooney, wearing a brown cap, is tanned, has a five o'clock shadow, a pencil moustache and grey streaks in his hair. They are sitting around talking and laughing with the Coens, waiting for the shot to be set up. They are called for the scene. Scene 12, take 1. The three cons walk towards the shack. Then Clooney misses a line and apologises. Joel pats his star on the back reassuringly. Clooney then goes over his lines again in a huddle with Turturro and Nelson before the next take, while the make-up girl makes repairs. Ethan tells Clooney he must talk like someone who enjoys talking. \"Yeah, yeah, got you,\" says Clooney. On take two, Clooney dries. \"Sorry,\" he says. Turturro and Nelson nod sympathetically. They don't have such convoluted dialogue. Ethan paces up and down. </p> <p>The actors gather their chains to advance on the farmhouse once more. They get through their dialogue without a hitch until the shot rings out and hits a bottle on a branch of a tree. After the fourth take, which seems to have met with Joel's satisfaction, Turturro asks for another. In any case, Deakins wasn't sure the bottle was in shot. </p> <p>Joel is yawning. \"Let's actually do a rehearsal in time. See how it feels.\" He has a word with the little shaven-haired boy. The boy grins. Joel shows him how to hold the gun to make it seem heavier. Joel knows about guns. After a rehearsal in which everyone is word perfect, the boy gets begrimed by the make-up person for the first take. The boy is great. </p> <p>A group of locals have gathered on a grassy knoll, many with cameras, to watch and ogle the short scene where the three cons come out of a store just as a man in a boater emerges from his car and enters the store. Everett waits for the man to disappear, signals to the others and they pile into the man's car and drive off. </p> <p>Perhaps there would have been less interest in the shoot if George Clooney had not been in it. He signs hundreds of autographs and poses with people for photographs. \"I grew up in a small town in Kentucky where they shot a series called Centennial,\" he says, \"and I followed Raymond Burr around everywhere he went. I know what it's like to see someone in person who you've watched on television or in the movies, and I don't get upset when people approach me.\"</p> <p>O Brother, Where Art Thou? premieres at the Edinburgh film festival on August 23.

      "body": "<p>Volvo's V70 estate was already well-established and highly popular when, three years ago, someone at the company stood up and said, \"Let's off-road!\" And along came the V70 Cross Country - an out-and-out rural vehicle, with four-wheel drive and a thick metal rack on the roof to strap dead deer on to, and with the chunky look of those all-terrain vehicles which are so popular these days on the streets of, among other places, London. The Cross Country, now available in a revamped model, is essentially the V70 with lots of thick plastic cladding on it - in particular at the front end and around the wheels - so that you don't ruin your paint-job on the brambles, or, as may be, on the stray trolleys in the car park at your local Asda. </p> <p>No matter what people actually end up using it for, this is a vehicle built to climb every mountain, ford every stream - and probably to follow every rainbow, if you've got the time and can afford the petrol. It clings tenaciously to Tarmac, clay and riverbed alike. It perches 20cms off the ground, which ought to give the rabbits a sporting chance, and there's an aluminium plate bolted to the car's underside to prevent gravel, bull-rushes, voles etc from gumming up the engine. </p> <p>Test driving a spanking new clean model, with the whiff of freshly stitched leather in one's nostrils, seemed a somehow false or irrelevant experience - although a high percentage of the V70 XC's putative owners will, one imagines, keep the car neatly valeted and only go near gravel when it crops up on someone's drive. Clearly, though, the car's design insists that the wheel arches should be permanently stucco'd with mud spray. The interior should smell of wet dog and Wellington. And every time you turn a corner there should be an almighty clatter as various bridles, shooting sticks, discarded Puffa jackets, and maybe the occasional Young Farmer in a drunken stupor, slew from one side of the boot to the other. </p> <p>The boot, incidentally, is large enough to serve as a stable. Indeed, I calculate you could get a full-grown horse and two foals in there, albeit lying down and with one of the foals on top of the other. Alternatively, you can collapse the back seats and give the second foal all the space it wants. The V70 pictures a life exorbitantly stuffed with children, animals and skis, and then, big-heartedly, caters to it. (Which makes it, incidentally, very difficult to reverse into small spaces.) </p> <p>And yet it still goes very fast. I wasn't expecting what is, in effect, an elongated horsebox, to steam away so quietly and effortlessly. But I was forgetting that this is, of course, a turbo-charged, 2.4 litre, elongated horsebox, capable of beating almost anything its own size to the first jump. And, because Volvo think of everything, it has immaculately swift and unterrifying brakes as well, so you can steady yourself when the first jump looms unexpectedly fast. </p> <p>Thanks to some assiduous image cultivation, the word everyone directly associates with Volvo is \"safety\". Since the 70s it's what this famous Swedish company has been most famous and Swedish for, apart from selling fewer records than Abba. Volvo, we warmly agree, make a \"safe\" car. Of course, there can be no genuinely \"safe car\" in the absence of genuinely \"safe drivers\", and what is really meant by \"safety\" in this context is, more realistically, \"protection\" or \"idiot-proofing\" - slightly less seductive aspects from a marketing point of view, but appealing in their own way. </p> <p>Partly because of the received wisdom, but also because of the vehicle's patently obvious solidity, there is something uniquely reassuring about sitting at the wheel of a Volvo. You feel quietly confident that you are piloting the finest padded cell that Swedish research can come up with - a car with air-bags and anti-crumple zones in places you didn't know cars had places. In the V70, you feel strangely - perhaps even dangerously, which would be ironic - impervious. Pretty much whatever you hit in this car, you imagine, be it pothole or cattle, is going to come off worse than you do. </p> <p>Of course, what you're likely to hit depends upon where you drive and here Volvo and the marketplace do seem to be interestingly at cross purposes. The V70 XC is a car built to be up to its axles in slurry, but is just as likely to end up at ease on its tyres in Surrey. Its smoothness and peacefulness are a major corrective for anyone who thought all-terrain driving was about the thrill of feeling the uneven road beneath your feet and the underside of the roof on your head. Has the off-roader ever been so thoroughly pampered - so lavishly furnished with pop-out drinks holders and ticket clips and coin cubby-holes and directional air-conditioning nozzles (even for your passengers in the rear)? The driver's seat is electronically adjustable to fit the individual contours of your backside, and I don't think I have felt more comfortable in a car. I didn't set one off to find out, but it wouldn't surprise me in the least if the airbags were padded with goose down. </p> <p>Then again, maybe Volvo have simply been smart enough to spot how, for the motorist, the gap between country and city is closing - and canny enough to pitch a car neatly into what remains of the divide. Even in urban areas, the spread of traffic-calming devices makes driving any distance at all a kind of off-road experience and calls out for vehicles with big clearances and high-performance suspensions. How else are you to maintain a steady 55 through those humps and chicanes? Hell, these days, wherever you are, it's a jungle out there. The V70 Cross Country is your machete. </p> <p><strong> The lowdown</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Volvo V70 XC </strong></p> <p><strong>Price:</strong> from \u00a328,910 </p> <p><strong> Maximum speed: </strong> 130mph </p> <p><strong> Acceleration:</strong> 0-62 in 8.6 seconds </p> <p><strong> Consumption:</strong> 26.9 mpg (combined) </p> <p><strong> At the wheel:</strong> John Craven </p> <p><strong> On the stereo:</strong> Clannad </p> <p><strong> En route for:</strong> Iceland (the shop)</p>",

The Cross Country, now available in a revamped model, is essentially the V70 with lots of thick plastic cladding on it - in particular at the front end and around the wheels - so that you don't ruin your paint-job on the brambles, or, as may be, on the stray trolleys in the car park at your local Asda. No matter what people actually end up using it for, this is a vehicle built to climb every mountain, ford every stream - and probably to follow every rainbow, if you've got the time and can afford the petrol. It clings tenaciously to Tarmac, clay and riverbed alike. It perches 20cms off the ground, which ought to give the rabbits a sporting chance, and there's an aluminium plate bolted to the car's underside to prevent gravel, bull-rushes, voles etc from gumming up the engine. Test driving a spanking new clean model, with the whiff of freshly stitched leather in one's nostrils, seemed a somehow false or irrelevant experience - although a high percentage of the V70 XC's putative owners will, one imagines, keep the car neatly valeted and only go near gravel when it crops up on someone's drive. Clearly, though, the car's design insists that the wheel arches should be permanently stucco'd with mud spray. The interior should smell of wet dog and Wellington. And every time you turn a corner there should be an almighty clatter as various bridles, shooting sticks, discarded Puffa jackets, and maybe the occasional Young Farmer in a drunken stupor, slew from one side of the boot to the other. The boot, incidentally, is large enough to serve as a stable. Indeed, I calculate you could get a full-grown horse and two foals in there, albeit lying down and with one of the foals on top of the other. Alternatively, you can collapse the back seats and give the second foal all the space it wants. The V70 pictures a life exorbitantly stuffed with children, animals and skis, and then, big-heartedly, caters to it. (Which makes it, incidentally, very difficult to reverse into small spaces.) And yet it still goes very fast. I wasn't expecting what is, in effect, an elongated horsebox, to steam away so quietly and effortlessly. But I was forgetting that this is, of course, a turbo-charged, 2.4 litre, elongated horsebox, capable of beating almost anything its own size to the first jump. And, because Volvo think of everything, it has immaculately swift and unterrifying brakes as well, so you can steady yourself when the first jump looms unexpectedly fast. Thanks to some assiduous image cultivation, the word everyone directly associates with Volvo is \"safety\". Since the 70s it's what this famous Swedish company has been most famous and Swedish for, apart from selling fewer records than Abba. Volvo, we warmly agree, make a \"safe\" car. Of course, there can be no genuinely \"safe car\" in the absence of genuinely \"safe drivers\", and what is really meant by \"safety\" in this context is, more realistically, \"protection\" or \"idiot-proofing\" - slightly less seductive aspects from a marketing point of view, but appealing in their own way. Partly because of the received wisdom, but also because of the vehicle's patently obvious solidity, there is something uniquely reassuring about sitting at the wheel of a Volvo. You feel quietly confident that you are piloting the finest padded cell that Swedish research can come up with - a car with air-bags and anti-crumple zones in places you didn't know cars had places. In the V70, you feel strangely - perhaps even dangerously, which would be ironic - impervious. Pretty much whatever you hit in this car, you imagine, be it pothole or cattle, is going to come off worse than you do. Of course, what you're likely to hit depends upon where you drive and here Volvo and the marketplace do seem to be interestingly at cross purposes. The V70 XC is a car built to be up to its axles in slurry, but is just as likely to end up at ease on its tyres in Surrey. Its smoothness and peacefulness are a major corrective for anyone who thought all-terrain driving was about the thrill of feeling the uneven road beneath your feet and the underside of the roof on your head. Has the off-roader ever been so thoroughly pampered - so lavishly furnished with pop-out drinks holders and ticket clips and coin cubby-holes and directional air-conditioning nozzles (even for your passengers in the rear)? The driver's seat is electronically adjustable to fit the individual contours of your backside, and I don't think I have felt more comfortable in a car. I didn't set one off to find out, but it wouldn't surprise me in the least if the airbags were padded with goose down. Then again, maybe Volvo have simply been smart enough to spot how, for the motorist, the gap between country and city is closing - and canny enough to pitch a car neatly into what remains of the divide. Even in urban areas, the spread of traffic-calming devices makes driving any distance at all a kind of off-road experience and calls out for vehicles with big clearances and high-performance suspensions. How else are you to maintain a steady 55 through those humps and chicanes? Hell, these days, wherever you are, it's a jungle out there. The V70 Cross Country is your machete. The lowdown Volvo V70 XC Price: from \u00a328,910 Maximum speed: 130mph Acceleration: 0-62 in 8.6 seconds Consumption: 26.9 mpg (combined) At the wheel: John Craven On the stereo: Clannad En route for: Iceland (the shop)",

Pressured into action to combat night-time plantation raids and highway robberies of trucks, 24-hour police units now patrol the roads and lanes outside the town of Tequila - the heart of national production in the western state of Jalisco. \"Instead of a couple of robberies every month, we started getting three or four complaints a week, so we were getting worried,\" said Salvador Ibarra Vargas, the head of security in Tequila. But the patrols only cover a limited area with limited resources and limited success, encouraging bigger producers, such as Jose Cuervo and Sauza, to turn to private security firms to guard the plantations and escort trucks carrying their precious crop to the distilleries. \"The thieves are taking advantage of the enormous prices we are prepared to pay,\" says Gustavo Hernandez, who directs exports for the Cazadores distillery, one of the top-selling quality tequilas. The crime wave sweeping tequila country was prompted by this year's agave crunch, which triggered a crisis for the industry in the midst of a boom that had doubled production in last five years as drinkers in Mexico and around the world fell under the tequila spell. The boom has been accompanied by an education of the global palate to demand finer, purer tequilas that require much more agave to produce. Apparently intoxicated by success, many tequila distillers had failed to plan for the future, taking for granted the supply of the previously undervalued raw material. This year, however, their heads really began to spin when local growers began reneging on their contracts and demanding ever greater prices for lower quality produce. \"The problem is that agave takes seven to 10 years to mature, and in 1992 nobody foresaw that there was going to be a boom and so they should plant more,\" says Mr Hernandez who predicts that the crisis will last until 2003, putting in danger the consolidation of new markets. Last month the cost of a tonne of agave soared to 14,000 pesos (\u00a31,000), almost 25 times what it was a year ago, prompting producers and growers to negotiate a fixed price of \u00a3650 per tonne for the next two years. But according to Mr Hernandez, there are already signs that a black market is developing. Mr Hernandez says his own company has escaped the highway bandits, but has been targeted by \"ant robbers\". These teams of agave rustlers work the fields under cover of darkness, hacking off the worthless spiky leaves from the cactus-like plant to reveal its enormous pineapple-shaped core - the source of the sugary juice that will be distilled twice to make tequila. Mr Hernandez says a group of five \"ant robbers\" can harvest around 10 tonnes in a night, making themselves close to $10,000 (about \u00a36,000).

He will now miss three matches early in the Premiership campaign. </p> <p>Afterwards Sir Alex Ferguson naturally played down the significance of the defeat. His teams have lost the curtain-raiser in previous years before going on to take the bouquets and the curtain calls in the spring. But as they conceded goals to Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Mario Melchiot in the 22nd and 73rd minutes, there was a feeling that United looked short of the kind of freshness that might be expected at the start of a new season, while players who have worked together for years never looked like reproducing the sort of blend that might have brought them back into the game. </p> <p>Five thousand empty seats, equally distributed between the red and blue halves of the stadium, provided an interesting comment on the public's attitude to the start of the new season. English football is still riding the tidal wave of commercial success - this is the last season of the old television deal, after which the game will begin a three-year term in which broadcasting rights will produce revenues of more than \u00a32bn - but the momentum has to be maintained and the national team's failure to achieve success in successive international competitions has not helped to sustain the necessary level of hype. </p> <p>The game in England is in a self-questioning mode, and while the acceptance that it cannot call itself the best in the world is at least a sign of realism, there is no knowing what damage that may eventually do to the enthusiasm of the broad mass of supporters. </p> <p>There will be those searching over the coming weeks for signs that the public is ceasing to respond to the Premier League's brazen self-image, and is perhaps even beginning to react against the idea of paying inflated wages to players who are no longer good enough to perform at the top level in Italy or Spain. The cases of Alen Boksic at Middlesbrough and Benito Carbone at Bradford City, and their effect on the clubs' supporters, will be watched with particular interest. </p> <p>Neither of yesterday's opponents need resort to such desperate measures. Both are in a position to ensure that their investment in players bears some relationship to their income, with the result that their teams, even when performing below par, at least maintain their integrity. There is always a measure of ambiguity about the relevance of the Charity Shield, but yesterday's fixture was good enough to provide an appealing trailer for the English season. </p> <p>\"It was a real match,\" a delighted Gianluca Vialli said after watching his players return to Wembley to lift another piece of silverware 12 weeks and a day after they had salvaged a disappointing season with an FA Cup victory over Aston Villa . \"The players performed in a very convincing way.\" </p> <p>He was particularly pleased to have given a brief run-out to Graeme le Saux, returning after a long absence. Le Saux's ankle injury cost him the place in Kevin Keegan's Euro 2000 squad that went to the ill-starred Phil Neville, who remained on the United bench throughout yesterday's match. </p> <p>Keane's dismissal, for a foul on Gustavo Poyet, was just one of the signs that this was, indeed, a \"real match\". Although the referee, Mike Riley, found no need to use the new 10-yard rule, there were a few isolated flare-ups, the first coming when United's volatile captain left his initial mark on Poyet after 17 minutes. His second bite, 16 minutes into the second half, brought an immediate red card. </p> <p>Ferguson, who thought Keane would be \"disappointed with himself\", suggested that Riley had made a mistake in letting earlier incidents go without showing a yellow card. \"Somewhere along the line the referee was going to act,\" he said. \"I think he left it too late.\" </p> <p>But most of the genuine fighting spirit in the match came from the players in blue shirts, for whom the two Dutch goalscorers were outstanding. Hasselbaink, in his first competitive match since his \u00a315m arrival from Atletico Madrid, looked as though he will provide Chelsea with the long-desired cutting edge. </p> <p>Even when he was missing a couple of good chances, he missed them with the sort of conviction Chris Sutton could never muster. For a man left out of Frank Rijkaard's Holland squad in the summer on the curious grounds that all he does is score goals, Hasselbaink made consistently useful contributions to the approach work of a team looking better equipped than ever to mount a serious challenge for the Premiership. </p> <p>And so they should, given that Vialli has been given the means to amass a squad whose strength in depth is indicated by the presence of no fewer than six international-calibre full-backs - Melchiot and Celestine Babayaro, who started the match yesterday, Le Saux, the injured Albert Ferrer, the newly acquired Christian Panucci and poor Jon Harley, the bright England prospect who could not even command a place on yesterday's bench. </p> <p>United, by contrast, looked undermanned even before they were reduced to 10 men, particularly in defence, where it may take a long time before Ferguson can feel that he is close to recreating the solidity of the defence that won him the first of his championships. In those days, he could scribble down the names of Schmeichel, Parker, Bruce, Pallister and Irwin without a second thought. Yesterday only Fabien Barthez really looked the part, even if was a little sad to see the irrepressible hero of the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000 cast in the unaccustomed role of loser. </p> <p>But although the arrival of Barthez and Hasselbaink may help sustain the entertainment value of the Premiership, they will be of no more help to Kevin Keegan than Boksic, Carbone or the dozens of other foreign players who have arrived over the summer. The England coach, a spectator in the Royal Box, would hardly have missed the fact that of the 22 players who started yesterday's match, only four were English. Anyone who thinks that this represents a reasonable ratio, or that the game can survive for long on those terms, should have a think about those empty seats. </p> <p><strong>Chelsea (4-4-2):</strong> De Goey; Melchiot, Leboeuf, Desailly, Babayaro; Stanic, Di Matteo, Wise, Poyet; Hasselbaink, Zola. <strong>Man Utd (4-4-2):</strong> Barthez; G Neville, Johnsen, Silvestre, Irwin; Beckham, Keane, Scholes, Giggs; Solskjaer, Sheringham.</p> <p><strong>Substitutions</strong> <br>Chelsea - Morris for Di Matteo (74), Gudjohnsen for Zola (74) Le Saux for Poyet (77).<br> Man Utd - Stam for Silvestre (19), Cole for Sheringham (70), Yorke for Solskjaer (70), Fortune for Giggs (78).</p> <p><strong>Booked:</strong> Man Utd - Scholes (81)<br> <strong>Sent off:</strong> Man Utd - Keane (62)<br> <strong>Referee:</strong> Mike Riley, Leeds.</p>",

Hasselbaink, in his first competitive match since his \u00a315m arrival from Atletico Madrid, looked as though he will provide Chelsea with the long-desired cutting edge. Even when he was missing a couple of good chances, he missed them with the sort of conviction Chris Sutton could never muster. For a man left out of Frank Rijkaard's Holland squad in the summer on the curious grounds that all he does is score goals, Hasselbaink made consistently useful contributions to the approach work of a team looking better equipped than ever to mount a serious challenge for the Premiership. And so they should, given that Vialli has been given the means to amass a squad whose strength in depth is indicated by the presence of no fewer than six international-calibre full-backs - Melchiot and Celestine Babayaro, who started the match yesterday, Le Saux, the injured Albert Ferrer, the newly acquired Christian Panucci and poor Jon Harley, the bright England prospect who could not even command a place on yesterday's bench. United, by contrast, looked undermanned even before they were reduced to 10 men, particularly in defence, where it may take a long time before Ferguson can feel that he is close to recreating the solidity of the defence that won him the first of his championships. In those days, he could scribble down the names of Schmeichel, Parker, Bruce, Pallister and Irwin without a second thought. Yesterday only Fabien Barthez really looked the part, even if was a little sad to see the irrepressible hero of the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000 cast in the unaccustomed role of loser. But although the arrival of Barthez and Hasselbaink may help sustain the entertainment value of the Premiership, they will be of no more help to Kevin Keegan than Boksic, Carbone or the dozens of other foreign players who have arrived over the summer. The England coach, a spectator in the Royal Box, would hardly have missed the fact that of the 22 players who started yesterday's match, only four were English. Anyone who thinks that this represents a reasonable ratio, or that the game can survive for long on those terms, should have a think about those empty seats. Chelsea (4-4-2): De Goey; Melchiot, Leboeuf, Desailly, Babayaro; Stanic, Di Matteo, Wise, Poyet; Hasselbaink, Zola. Man Utd (4-4-2): Barthez; G Neville, Johnsen, Silvestre, Irwin; Beckham, Keane, Scholes, Giggs; Solskjaer, Sheringham. Substitutions Chelsea - Morris for Di Matteo (74), Gudjohnsen for Zola (74) Le Saux for Poyet (77). Man Utd - Stam for Silvestre (19), Cole for Sheringham (70), Yorke for Solskjaer (70), Fortune for Giggs (78). Booked: Man Utd - Scholes (81) Sent off: Man Utd - Keane (62) Referee: Mike Riley, Leeds.",

      "body": "<p>For years there had been talk of \"the gap in the women's magazine market\". Everyone over 40 or so (think Jerry Hall, Helen Mirren, Mo Mowlam, Michelle Pfeiffer) still interested in sex, life, fashion, beauty and intelligent reading matter, thought magazines ignored us. </p> <p>But last May, amidst a fanfare of publicity masterminded by Brown Lloyd James, a new women's magazine arrived on the racks. Called Aura, it came from Parkhill Publishing, based in Grays Inn Road, its editorial director (who was also the chairman of Parkhill) was former Sunday Mirror and Sunday Express editor, Eve Pollard. </p> <p>It was she who garnered most of the publicity, despite being one of four partners. But with her flair, charm and high profile that was to be expected. Eve Pollard is married to Nick Lloyd, the former editor of the Daily Express, and the Lloyd in Brown Lloyd James. </p> <p>Aura was aimed at women who had long outgrown Cosmo and Marie Claire, but didn't feel the Good Housekeeping image was what they had in mind to complement their kitten-heeled mules and Agent Provocateur bra. Even if some of them were size 16 plus, warm, good women with two or three kids, in their minds they were Agent Provocateur material. </p> <p>A masterstroke by one of the launch editors, the ex-Woman's Journal editor Deirdre Vine, resulted, after endless transatlantic negotiations, in Aura's cover shoot with Hollywood actress Susan Sarandon - draped across the floor, arms flung back, hair extensions tumbling around her head, legs in the air, wearing a feather boa, fishnet tights and high heels. This was, perhaps, the first time an adult, intelligent woman had been portrayed on a cover looking really sexy. </p> <p>More than 100,000 women and quite a few men bought the magazine. They ignored the pedestrian layout and design, and once they'd read Germaine Greer, Fay Weldon, Leslie Kenton, Cherie Booth, Erica Jong and Paula Yates and pored over David Bailey's pictures, hundreds of them wrote and emailed. </p> <p>\"The writing's brilliant\", they said. \"The fashion and style are great\", they enthused. \"We love the tone, the honesty and it's not full of ads\", they trilled. </p> <p>The poignant confessions of Germaine Greer went straight into a double-page spread in the Daily Mail, arranged by Brown Lloyd James. Yes, they did overlook the um, little matter that there'd been no prior arrangement with Greer to sell on her story to the Mail. But it was great publicity for Aura, and something was sorted out with Ed Victor, Greer's agent. </p> <p>The June issue had pictures of Joanna Trollope - with legs in the air, wearing, er, fishnet tights and a feather boa. Celebrity interviewer Chrissy Iley wrote a blisteringly good profile and Brown Lloyd James again gave it to the Mail. </p> <p>Great for Aura publicity, but Iley fumed in Hollywood. Joanna Trollope and her agents were livid in London. \"I specifically told Nick Lloyd not to offer it to the Daily Mail because it would cause huge problems with my Sunday Times contract,\" says Iley. \"I did the piece for Aura out of loyalty to Kate Carr [ex-Sunday Times commissioning editor and one of Aura's launch editors]. She's totally trustworthy. I always sign a first rights deal for many reasons: it may upset the Sunday Times and also the person I'm interviewing. They may be happy to appear in a woman's magazine but hate the thought of appearing in the newspapers.\" </p> <p>Richard Burton, the managing editor, recalls that \"there was a bit of a fuss\" over Iley's complaint, but thought it had been \"sorted out\". </p> <p>More good names came thick and fast: Lynne Truss, Kathy Lette, Trudie Styler, Muriel Gray, Terry O'Neill, Edwina Currie, Roz Miles. Paula Yates started her agony column. Vanessa Feltz, four stones lighter, posed for swimsuit shots and wrote a marvellously humorous piece for the July issue. The Daily Mail loved it. It made the front page plus another spread for Aura. But Deirdre Vine, editor of Aura, was horrified as no prior agreement had been reached with Feltz. </p> <p>\"Vanessa trusted me,\" she says. Did Nick Lloyd care? Did Eve Pollard care? \"They seem to have a complete disregard for people's rights,\" says Kate Carr. </p> <p>Iley calls Pollard and Lloyd \"an amusing but sinister double act\". \"They lack moral courtesy. They're cavalier and arrogant. Celebrities who thought they were going to appear in a glossy woman's magazine could find themselves strewn over the tabloids like dirty knickers. I'm never writing for Aura again.\" </p> <p>But subscriptions were piling in. In their hundreds. But then on July 27, as the August issue hit the stands, Parkhill Publishing, which also publishes the well-received Wedding Day, told the staff the company was running out of cash and the directors were looking for a buyer for both titles. The staff were sent home and Eve Pollard got on a plane and went to her home in the south of France. </p> <p>There was an eerie silence from the press. Strange considering Pollard's high profile? \"Not strange,\" says Iley. \"Nick Lloyd is a fully paid up member of the old boys' network. Current editors always take their calls and do their bidding.\" </p> <p>The Evening Standard used its media page that Wednesday to promote Eve, the rather dazzling new BBC entry into the grown-up woman's market. The Times's media diary was cluckingly sympathetic about Pollard's media proprietorship. \"The staff of Parkhill have grown quite fond of her in the frenzied past few months and are genuinely sad for her,\" it said. One devotee (could this be a Brown Lloyd James employee?) was quoted as saying: \"A lot of people found Eve difficult to get used to, but she really is a brilliant journalist who deserved better than this.\" </p> <p>The journalists' trade magazine, Press Gazette, blamed those two old enemies, time and money. Oh yes, and the seasonal August slump and the money being spent on Red and Eve. Nobody attached the slightest blame to Pollard, nor the way she was running her company. They wouldn't dare. </p> <p>Brown Lloyd James, writing press releases and handling all inquiries, assured everyone that the \"staff salaries\" have been paid until the end of July. But there is a sea of freelance writers, designers, photographers, stylists, assistants, contributing editors, make-up artists and even the printers who've been waiting weeks and months for their money. </p> <p>Some are furious, some are worried sick, some are resigned to not being paid. They're people with mortgages, kids, money worries, commitments. They tend not to be people like Eve Pollard and Nick Lloyd with homes in Hampstead and the south of France. But it has long been a Parkhill joke that no freelancers ever got paid until it was absolutely necessary. </p> <p>Pollard has pledged that everyone will be paid and that there is enough money in the Parkhill kitty. Most people simply don't believe her. In fact, Burton explains that there is \"a large debt book\". </p> <p>This time nobody, except staff who happened to be in the office on the day the suspension of publication was announced, has even been officially notified. Contributors may have read it in the papers or been phoned up by colleagues. </p> <p>Aura beauty editor Sarah Standing says: \"Call me unworldly but I assumed if a magazine you were working on suddenly folded and you no longer had a job, someone would let you know. I'm staggered not to have a received a letter signed by Eve Pollard. This would never happen at Cond\u00e9 Nast. Her lack of manners simply amazes me. Particularly as I'm still owed money.\" </p> <p>Some contributors are owed hundreds of pounds, some thousands. When the suspension of publication at Parkhill was announced to staff, they were told to clear their desks and go within the hour. Many refused. One editor said they had loyalties to the people they'd commissioned to do work, they had their own professional integrity and reputations at stake. They'd called in favours and the least they could do was ring people and inform them. Pollard said, in a sudden burst of empathy: \"I know exactly what you mean. I feel awful that I asked Margaret (Baroness) Jay to write a piece.\" </p> <p>What, apart from a breathtaking lack of responsibility, went wrong? From the beginning, just about everything. In the spring of 1999, Pollard, who'd been unemployed for five years save for her novel writing and fellow director David Sinclair, a former financial editor and her deputy at the Sunday Express, went to the City for venture capital. </p> <p>\"Markets were buoyant,\" says former Parkhill group ad director, Fiona Davidson. \"They raised money easily from Phildrew Ventures. Eve is brilliant at marketing and self-promotion.\" </p> <p>Davidson thought the business plan far too ambitious, devised by people who knew nothing about magazines. It is true that the management team were steeped in newspaper backgrounds. Magazines and newspapers are very different animals. But it seems Sinclair was confident that his plan - a small company, the latest technology, a small staff with the rest of the work done by freelancers or people on short-term contracts and very tight cost control - could work. </p> <p>Certainly Phildrew was impressed to the tune of over \u00a31m. So Pollard, Sinclair, Jane Sproul from the Mail on Sunday and Charles Thompson from Granville investment bank were in business. Champagne corks popped, media pages took note and the Mogulette, as Nick called his wife, was back in the hot seat. </p> <p>From day one, according to insiders, Pollard thought of it as her own company and it went \"completely to her head\". The business plan was \"blown out of the water\", said one. She hired a personal PA and a \u00a350,000-a-year executive editor, refused to use the technology and wouldn't agree to hire anyone her fellow directors had chosen. She spoke of \"your people\" versus \"my people\". A typical Pollard speech would go: \"Look, I'm the chairman of this company. I'm entitled to get what I want. I'm sure Lord Rothermere gets what he wants. Tina Brown gets what she wants.\" </p> <p>One of her team says: \"Her ego went into overdrive. Board meetings were a shambles. She refused to allow anyone to set up a management structure. What shocked me about the whole enterprise was when Phildrew came in I assumed they'd keep an eye on management, which they utterly failed to do. They were so dazzled by Eve.\" </p> <p>Within six weeks, David Sinclair had left the company. In the spring, Jane Sproul and Charles Thompson also left. The previously gung-ho and enthusiastic advertising director, Fiona Davidson, resigned on May 15. </p> <p>\"Miracles had been performed by lots of people for the first couple of issues,\" she says. \"But you just could not continue with a complete lack of structure and no business plan. I was working seven days a week\". Parkhill couldn't admit to another senior walk-out. Nick Lloyd put out a press release to the advertising industry saying that \"the board has lost confidence in Fiona Davidson and asked her to leave\". </p> <p>Next, Deirdre Vine and Kate Carr, highly intelligent, principled editors, handed in their notices, though Vine did stay on as a part-time consultant and helped to recruit an editor - former You magazine executive Jane Phillimore - who was hired too late to start work. Aura didn't have a publisher, or an advertisement director. And there wasn't a circulation director. You couldn't make it up. Ab Fab meets Fawlty Towers. </p> <p>But a new managing editor, Richard Burton, was found. It has to be said that experienced editorial jaws dropped with amazement when Burton, a back-bench sub at the Daily Telegraph, was appointed managing editor of Parkhill and managing director designate early in the year. </p> <p>Considering that he had never worked full-time on a magazine in his life, and knew nothing whatsoever about beauty or fashion shoots, or page rates, or indeed anything that might have been in a job description for managing editor of a magazine company, you could say in fairness that he did his best. </p> <p>It's true that he had acted as a contract magazine consultant and had a little business experience. He worked long hours. He said no to everyone who wanted to spend money. As he says: \"I cancelled photo shoots and pulled out of a \u00a312,000 cover-mount to ensure that we'd be solvent.\" He went to endless meetings, interviewed new staff and he tried very hard to keep Pollard happy. </p> <p>Burton says now that when the circulation director walked out after a few weeks \"in retrospect, it was foolish not to have appointed someone else\". But he, too, insists there is enough for people to get paid and says it's his \"personal crusade\" to see that they do. He is a decent man who feels morally responsible for all the staff. He's given his home and mobile numbers to everyone concerned to know what's happening and has pledged to inform them and fight on their behalf. </p> <p>Kate Carr says there was lots of money when she and Vine joined Aura in November of last year. But it became obvious, once invoices came in, that they weren't being paid. Then it snowballed. \"No one understood magazines,\" she says. </p> <p>\"They didn't understand you had to pay writers even if you didn't use the piece. As time went by, I realised I was compromising all my contacts. I was promising writers and publicists things I wasn't confident I could control. I know it will be presented as 'Parkhill, brave little fish, against all the big sharks'. But it was so unprofessional.\" </p> <p>Phildrew finally installed a financial monitor at Parkhill. The words stable door and bolted spring to mind. No one ever doubted Pollard's energy, her terrific tabloid instincts, her gift for promotion and her ability to get people to do things for her. She slapped flattery on with a trowel if she needed you. But did she have management skills? </p> <p>One of her former fellow directors thinks not. One of her longest serving Parkhill editors says: \"Whilst on a personal level she could sometimes be utterly charming, her management style is that of a Sherman tank. Browbeating, bullying, intimidating and humiliating. She rarely listened to what you said and if she didn't like what you said, she'd put her hand in front of your face to stop you speaking further.\" Ex-director Sinclair sadly reflects that it was a missed opportunity: \"The way Eve treated people meant that team spirit disappeared.\" </p> <p>Yet Pollard is genuinely baffled by the attacks. Though unwilling to speak on the record until the company's future is certain, she did say: \"I didn't have a major spat with anyone. There was no time to have a big ego because we were all working so hard. It's so easy to target La Bollard.\" </p> <p>Burton, quite separately, agrees: \"Every editor and senior executive has their own style. When you work with Eve Pollard then you know you're going to get Eve Pollard. The problem was money, not Eve's personality.\" </p> <p>Pollard was disappointed by losing Sinclair but points out that he left the company because he wished to work partially from Ireland, which was unacceptable. One of the key problems, according to both her and Burton, was the failure to obtain \"secondary funding\". Pollard adds: \"Frankly, we just didn't sell enough advertising.\" Both are convinced that Aura could find a buyer very soon, proving that it was a worthwhile magazine. So far, only one subscriber has asked for her money back. </p> <p>Wedding Day has been bought, \"for a reasonable sum\" by Crimson Publishing. Its managing director, David Lester, discovered enough to realise that it is a viable magazine but he was less sanguine about Aura. Even so, it is known that when he returns from abroad he may well reconsider. One other potential buyer is also in the offing. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Burton says his phone rings night and day with calls from contributors, agents and former staff. Having generously made himself the only point of contact, he has also received solicitors' writs. Pollard, meanwhile, is back in the south of France. </p> <p>\u0095 Marcelle d'Argy Smith was a contributing editor on Aura. Additional material by Roy Greenslade</p>",

As he says: \"I cancelled photo shoots and pulled out of a \u00a312,000 cover-mount to ensure that we'd be solvent.\" He went to endless meetings, interviewed new staff and he tried very hard to keep Pollard happy. Burton says now that when the circulation director walked out after a few weeks \"in retrospect, it was foolish not to have appointed someone else\". But he, too, insists there is enough for people to get paid and says it's his \"personal crusade\" to see that they do. He is a decent man who feels morally responsible for all the staff. He's given his home and mobile numbers to everyone concerned to know what's happening and has pledged to inform them and fight on their behalf. Kate Carr says there was lots of money when she and Vine joined Aura in November of last year. But it became obvious, once invoices came in, that they weren't being paid. Then it snowballed. \"No one understood magazines,\" she says. \"They didn't understand you had to pay writers even if you didn't use the piece. As time went by, I realised I was compromising all my contacts. I was promising writers and publicists things I wasn't confident I could control. I know it will be presented as 'Parkhill, brave little fish, against all the big sharks'. But it was so unprofessional.\" Phildrew finally installed a financial monitor at Parkhill. The words stable door and bolted spring to mind. No one ever doubted Pollard's energy, her terrific tabloid instincts, her gift for promotion and her ability to get people to do things for her. She slapped flattery on with a trowel if she needed you. But did she have management skills? One of her former fellow directors thinks not. One of her longest serving Parkhill editors says: \"Whilst on a personal level she could sometimes be utterly charming, her management style is that of a Sherman tank. Browbeating, bullying, intimidating and humiliating. She rarely listened to what you said and if she didn't like what you said, she'd put her hand in front of your face to stop you speaking further.\" Ex-director Sinclair sadly reflects that it was a missed opportunity: \"The way Eve treated people meant that team spirit disappeared.\" Yet Pollard is genuinely baffled by the attacks. Though unwilling to speak on the record until the company's future is certain, she did say: \"I didn't have a major spat with anyone. There was no time to have a big ego because we were all working so hard. It's so easy to target La Bollard.\" Burton, quite separately, agrees: \"Every editor and senior executive has their own style. When you work with Eve Pollard then you know you're going to get Eve Pollard. The problem was money, not Eve's personality.\" Pollard was disappointed by losing Sinclair but points out that he left the company because he wished to work partially from Ireland, which was unacceptable. One of the key problems, according to both her and Burton, was the failure to obtain \"secondary funding\". Pollard adds: \"Frankly, we just didn't sell enough advertising.\" Both are convinced that Aura could find a buyer very soon, proving that it was a worthwhile magazine. So far, only one subscriber has asked for her money back. Wedding Day has been bought, \"for a reasonable sum\" by Crimson Publishing. Its managing director, David Lester, discovered enough to realise that it is a viable magazine but he was less sanguine about Aura. Even so, it is known that when he returns from abroad he may well reconsider. One other potential buyer is also in the offing. Meanwhile, Burton says his phone rings night and day with calls from contributors, agents and former staff. Having generously made himself the only point of contact, he has also received solicitors' writs. Pollard, meanwhile, is back in the south of France. \u0095 Marcelle d'Argy Smith was a contributing editor on Aura. Additional material by Roy Greenslade",

Religion, current affairs, news, science, education and arts all had to be in the schedule, and locked into hard slots in case the channel controllers started to play fast and loose with the timing - which everyone I ever worked with felt compelled to do. The reason successive controllers felt frustrated with their schedule was that it was increasingly out of date.

And like it or lump it, we are all going to be digital in the end.

Unless things have changed radically in the few weeks since I left the BBC, all of its four general networks - 1, 2, 3 and 4 - will contain a mix of different genres.

Is there a future for the BBC in which it is a holding company whose large, commercially funded networks subsidise publicly funded programme-making on a much-reduced licence fee? By doing this, do we guarantee adventurous, high-quality television that will increase the BBC's global significance? Will it be good enough that the BBC is a brilliant media company dedicated to taking risks? If we fetishise the mixed schedule, we'll jeopardise even this possibility. </p> <p>If we accept this change in the terms of the debate, then we can have it honestly and above board, rather than the BBC flying the flag.

Bill Hillsman, the maverick adman who created the \"best political commercial in history\" and who has been hired to run the presidential campaign of consumer advocate and Green party candidate Ralph Nader, is ready to throw some grenades into what has so far been a lacklustre race. </p> <p>\"We're really paying the price in this country for all these years of insipid political discourse and insipid political advertising,\" says Hillsman, sitting in the offices of the ad agency of which he is president in the Warehouse district of Minneapolis. \"Corporations are being blackmailed to give money. It's gotten to such a nadir that good people don't want to run for office any more.\" </p> <p>Hillsman is famous in the advertising business for masterminding the campaign that took the wrestler and Reform party candidate Jesse Ventura to the governorship of Minnesota and for a number of other imaginative campaigns for Democrats, such as Senator Paul Wellstone, that have made a virtue of operating on a tight budget. His very funny ad for Wellstone, which showed the candidate in pursuit of his embarrassed opponent, won the \"best political commercial in history\" award from readers of Campaign magazine. </p> <p>Around $250m will be spent this year by the candidates for the White House, with Gore and Bush each accounting for more than $100m. \"More and more money is being spent and fewer and fewer people turn out,\" says Hillsman, 47, a former journalism professor who comes from Chicago but has made his home and copywriting reputation in Minnesota. \"I'm not being paranoid, but the beneficiaries of this are the Democrats and Republicans, and the people who are in league with them. I've always looked for a term like the military-industrial complex to describe them, but it's the political consultancy industry in Washington which is... filthy, totally corrupt.\" </p> <p>Hillsman believes that the opinion polls which drive so much of political debate and strategy are skewed to benefit the two main parties and that political advertising is so poor partly because ad agencies make their money on a proportion - 15% - of what is spent on buying airtime; thus the more they spend on production values, the less they have to buy commercial spots and consequently the smaller percentage they get. Hence, according to Hillsman, the low and cliched standard of much political advertising: \"There's an inherent conflict of interest.\" </p> <p>The \"nadir\" of political campaigning - Hillsman, like a good adman, notes the pun - has led to Nader running. His campaign is already making waves, causing the Democrats to warn that if Nader does well - he is around 7% in the polls - he could let George W Bush into the White House by drawing votes away from Al Gore. Hillsman is not concerned about that scenario and has even offered the Democrats, for whom he has done much work in the past decade, his services to mastermind a negative campaign against Bush. It sounds as though he has already written his first draft. </p> <p>\"George Bush is a walking corporation who has never done anything in his entire life except to have people take care of him,\" he says. Bush has already spent around $60m. This week his campaign ads have shown him in an open-necked shirt mingling with students while he intones: \"It's easy just to spend more. Let's start by expecting more.\" </p> <p>The standard of political advertising is abysmally low, according to Hillsman. \"The people who practise political media consultancy really don't understand modern communications. They are using advertising theories that were de rigueur in the 50s and the 70s.\" The former style was the repeated mention of a unique selling proposition, \"the notion that if you kept hammering away [the message] would eventually bludgeon its way into people's consciousness.\" </p> <p>In the 70s, the style was to keep mentioning the brand name and focus on the \"pack shot\". Both methods, Hillsman says, are now off-putting to a visually sophisticated audience. \"I think it's insane. The prevailing philosophy seems to be that you can annoy someone into voting for you.\" </p> <p>What many, including Hillsman, believe were the most effective presidential commercials were those run for Ronald Reagan in 1984, shot on film using a big budget and creating a warm, feel-good, homy atmosphere under the slogan of \"It's morning again in America.\" Hillsman says of the mood in the ads: \"There would be a small-town parade; people would be running the flags up the flagpole. It was total propaganda but it was so well done that it was almost impossible to resist. Meanwhile, [Walter] Mondale was doing the same old crap and not breaking through at all.\" </p> <p>George Bush senior used negative ads to effect against Democrat Michael Dukakis in 1988, most notably with a commercial showing prisoners moving through a revolving door to create the impression of someone weak on crime, always seen as a vote-winning issue. Four years later, Bush was the victim when the Clinton campaign in 1992 mocked Bush's earlier claim of \"read my lips - no new taxes.\" But there are risks in negative campaigning nowadays. \"There is more backlash against it now; it's being put more and more under scrutiny by the press,\" says Hillsman. The real negative damage, he says, is now \"below the radar\", a tactic which Bush last used against this year's defeated Republican candidate John McCain. </p> <p>Al Gore's best bet, Hillsman believes, is to have a one-to-one debate with Bush. \"The Gore people are struggling. At this point they are really hoping that the [three planned live television] debates will be the turning point in which Gore [could exploit] Bush's lack of fire power upstairs. I would not do much different for Bush. I think they're doing a very adroit job of trying to move Bush towards the centre, a typical Republican strategy, trying to soften his image - compassionate conservatism - and totally ignoring the actual truth of the situation.\" </p> <p>He dismisses the Gore camp's claims that a Nader vote will be wasted, because the Nader voters, in Hillsman's estimation, come largely from the 50% of the electorate who do not bother to vote for a president: \"They don't accept the idea of voting for the lesser evil. They don't want to vote for evil at all.\" </p> <p>On other forms of reaching the electorate, he says: \"It's an open book on how effective the internet sites are going to be in politics.\" Those using the internet to gather information on politics, he says, are almost all independents. \"They don't believe the information they get from the two main political parties and they don't really believe the established media any more.\" He believes that this will aid the Nader camp. \"Because people have such a low opinion of politicians, you start below zero on the truth meter if you're a politician. In Ralph's case, you can't get him to not tell the truth. That's a powerful weapon. He is arguably the most trusted man in America.\" </p> <p>In the current Adweek, the industry paper, Debra Goldman asks: \"Can democracy withstand a campaign so excruciatingly long that voters die of boredom long before election day?...

Before Klein transcended the traditional parameters of his trade with Primary Colors, his best-selling satire on the Clintons, he wrote a book about Woody Guthrie, the ultimate expression of the hobo troubadour and an irresistible subject for an excavator of authenticity. </p> <p>Bragg, the unfashionably leftwing Bard of Barking, and the band Wilco used some of what Klein unearthed in two albums of Guthrie's songs. \"Bragg?\" Klein repeats over a glass (just the one) of top-shelf Belvedere vodka in the impossibly elitist lobby bar of the Four Seasons hotel in Manhattan. </p> <p>\"I love him as a singer, but I think his politics are anachronistic and kind of retro.\" Klein, who set off a manhunt unparalleled in the recent history of literature by publishing Primary Colors under the name Anonymous four years ago, divides much of the world into naughty boys and goody-goodies. </p> <p>Thus George W Bush, the man most likely to be the next president of the United States, was one of the boys at the back of the class hurling spitballs (weapons of derision fashioned from paper and saliva) at the irredeemably well-behaved stationed at the front. Al Gore, Bush's Democratic opponent, was one of those closest to the teacher. </p> <p>\"Bush is a very charming guy and very authoritative when it comes to things like baseball. But, you know, the other stuff...\" And Gore? \"Gore's a good boy, he's the one you hated in high school.\" Klein, who writes for the New Yorker magazine and says he does not have a cynical sinew in his short frame, brings his vast fascination for the exercise of power and the workings of culture to a panel discussion on political spin at the Guardian Edinburgh International Television Festival at the end of the month. </p> <p>His take on the art of spinning and its practitioners is simple enough: spin is dead, it's just that no one ever told the politicians who remain addicted to its use. </p> <p>\"Bill Clinton's not bad although he's had his truly awful moments. Who does not have a knack with spin, or didn't when I was over there in 97, is Tony Blair.\" Klein, who has written for the alternative press, Rolling Stone and New York magazine, was in the UK to cover the last general election. He considers the result to have been a victory for Labour substance over spin and a hapless Conservative party. </p> <p>\"Clinton is just perfect when people haven't told him what to say. He's brilliant at defending himself. But when he's on message - one of the most hideous, reprehensible terms of the spin era - he's transparent. </p> <p>\"And what Blair was doing in 97 was transparent: the same three market-tested words - opportunity, responsibility, community. Those are the ones that Clinton used in 1991. </p> <p>\"George W Bush ran for governor of Texas with a bus that said opportunity on one side, responsibility on the other. Folk here have caught up with the fact that they are being manipulated.\" </p> <p>Journalists, of course, are incorrigible know-alls and there are those who might question the analysis of a mere scribbler born 54 years ago in Queens, New York, and raised in an ambiance not unlike that seen in Woody Allen's movie Radio Days (Klein, naturally, has discussed the matter with the director). </p> <p>But the writer can claim solid credentials in nailing spin, even if he was not exactly there at its birth. It would be as well to define what it is we are talking about here, a word appropriated by Ben Bradlee, former editor of the Washington Post, when he would ask reporters what spin they were putting on their stories. </p> <p>\"Spin is putting your own favourable interpretation on the events of the day,\" says Klein, the sleeves of his blue blazer riding up his arms as he leans into the subject. \"Who invented political spin? It certainly existed when Louis XIV said 'I am the state.' I think it obviously existed in ancient Greece. You know that Moses was spinning like crazy in Exodus XIV through XVII when the Jewish people wanted to go back and become a place again because tramping through the desert was a bit too hard.\" </p> <p>Enter Joe Klein, many years later. \"I think I had a small part in the evolution - I think I coined the term spinmeister in New York magazine in 88. I was describing the scene after one of the presidential debates that year when each of the candidates had their spinmeisters working over the press. It seemed sort of ridiculous.\" </p> <p>And with that, apparently, the effective use of the device was dead, way before the laggardly British, for instance, had even acknowledged spin as an endemic feature of political life. </p> <p>\"A journalist asked one of the candidates in 88: 'who's doing spin for you?' And I thought, just as the mainstream press realised there was such a thing as hippies when hippies staged a funeral for the concept in San Francisco, it was time to bury spin then and there. The interesting thing is that the public is so much hipper than the politicians when it comes to this stuff. They know it when they hear it. They're sick of it. Enough already.\" </p> <p>Klein, himself a back of the class kind of guy, has a soft spot for the six US senators who served in the Vietnam war, the men who represent for him the Real Stuff, and not least among them John McCain, the Republican insurgent who momentarily derailed the Bush campaign. \"McCain is obviously very candid. Or at least he was until he started winning elections and then he became a little less so.\" </p> <p>Elements of these men coalesce in the character of the hero of Klein's latest book, The Running Mate, a very human senator from a mid-western state. \"The best spin is the appearance of the absence of spin. It's genuineness. It's authenticity.

And he shrugs his shoulders and says 'what can I say? She swept me off my foot.' That'll turn my head every time. I'll give that guy the benefit of the doubt in a heartbeat.

It makes them more understanding of the flaws that the rest of us have.\" </p> <p>Klein was considered by many friends and colleagues to have revealed a flaw in the course of what might be termed his extra-journalistic relationship with the media when he denied that he was Anonymous. For six months he dismissed attempts at identification until an analysis of his handwriting on the manuscript made his authorship undeniable. </p> <p>The gimmick and the thrill of the chase drove Primary Colors to the top of the best-seller lists but Klein says that at the time there was no sign of what he was getting himself into. \"We had no idea that it was going to take off the way it did. It was a surprise to Random House. They were lowering the print run right up to the minute of publication. </p> <p>\"My best-case scenario was that it might spend a week or so on the best-seller list and that it would be a fun guessing-game in Washington and all my friends would guess that it was me within the first week, despite my proforma denial. Then it comes out and people in the White House start accusing each other of having written it and I think 'My God, this must be a lot closer than I thought it was'.\" </p> <p> Suddenly, the unmasked Klein was being told that he was now a professional celebrity, that he had been granted entrance to the parallel televisual universe composed of what he divines as a kaleidoscope of mindless rot.

I haven't heard a single American politician this convention season openly cite any area of domestic policy for which any example from overseas practice holds promise for the United States.

Britain dutifully trod the American path step by step.</p> <p>And the poverty figures, unsurprisingly, cut exactly the same way. On relative poverty (the percentage of population living on less than 40% of the median income in each country) we are comfortably top of the big EU league: at 5.3%, as against Germany's 2.4%. The statistics for absolute poverty are equally bleak.</p> <p>In sum, when economic commentators talk about Britain following the US and not the European financial cycle (so that joining the euro is a perennially dodgy enterprise) they include more than stocks, shares and inflation rates.

      "byline": "Mark Lawson",

      "body": "<p>The BBC marked the death of Sir Alec Guinness by rescreening a Parkinson interview from the late 70s. His conversation was urbane, educated, literate. In general, though, actors are the most difficult interviewees to be found among public professionals. This is because their talent is for disguise and borrowed lines. Expecting an actor to impress as himself imposes the same limitations as insisting the Home Secretary discuss prisons with John Humphrys only in the persona of the Prince of Denmark. </p> <p>For this reason, hopes were low for Channel 4's Starstruck, a four-part series about acting. But while the fault of many interviews with actors is to exaggerate the perils and risks of what they do - that notorious thespian tendency to compare a supporting role in Chekhov to swimming through shark-infested rivers - this series from Emmas Hewitt and Cahusac concentrates on genuine dangers. </p> <p>For example, this week's opening night show focuses on the sexual (and usually sexist) dynamics of casting. Renee Simone, a Hollywood hopeful, is seen living on a regime of sweat-out and water-in as she struggles to lose the final 10 pounds (she's already shed 51) which may bring her closer to the industry's anorexic definition of sexiness. For actresses, it's a paradox of casting directors that the more you vanish the more they see you. </p> <p>Renee's acting career fails to progress, but the agents and advisers around her seem certain to be cast in the next satire from Woody Allen or David Mamet on the movie business. One of the joys of the programme is that Renee's entourage are all fluent in the cinematic gangsterese which is now the lingua franca of Beverly Hills. </p> <p>One of the agents advising Renee specialises in muscular but impenetrable metaphor. \"What she projects is beach-blanket bingo,\" she complains of the still insufficiently skeletal Renee, \"and that's so OUT right now!\" As bad news continues to come in from the gym and the scales, the advisors decide temporarily to abandon the strategy of melting Renee towards leading-lady weight. \"We're going to put glasses on her and have her be a nerd. There's lots of freaks and geeks out there... Until we're ready to unveil the moth, we'll show her as a butterfly or she'll be a swan.\" </p> <p>The beach-blanket bingo butterfly is last seen going nowhere on a gym nasium treadmill and seeking a new agent. Her story is funny - especially the dialogue - but disturbing in its implications. As you watch, you want her to raise two fingers to the Hollywood system but you fear that any digits lifted would soon go down her throat. </p> <p>Renee's English co-star in the documentary is Ella Kenion, an actress from among the middle-higher dress-sizes who watches the big parts going to small women. Filmed auditioning for a Scandinavian emulsion commercial, she is warned by her agent that, in order to win the role of the screen wife watching paint dry, she mustn't come across as \"an eager beaver or a nag\". She nervously checks with the documentary's director that the cardigan she's chosen doesn't make her look \"enormous\". </p> <p>The film's thesis that cinema and television are cast as wet dreams for men isn't new, and could be as thin as the actress who wins out over Ella in selling paint to Swedes. But the power is in the evidential detail of the anecdotes - the casting session where the room was dominated by a giant mattress on which the director conducted horizontal interviews; the ageing famous actor who, as a matter of routine, pressed his erection against the backs of the junior actresses as they waited in the wings; the young American actresses now apparently having plastic surgery as an investment towards possible celebrity. </p> <p>In a therapeutic reversal of professional convention, unknowns take the lead roles in the documentary while stars have soundbite bit-parts. Where the experience of Renee and Ella demonstrates the pseudo-sex of casting, established performers describe the etiquette of faking sex on screen. </p> <p>Withnail And I writer Bruce Robinson recalls his experience as a young actor on a Zefferelli film when - failing to simulate excitement to the degree the maestro wanted - a box of strap-on phalluses of different sizes was proffered by the props man. Fay Ripley from ITV's Cold Feet reveals a kind of Geneva Convention within the profession relating to the rehearsal and performance of sex scenes. Verbal permission should be sought before the tongue is employed and teeth should be cleaned if filming after lunch. </p> <p>Ripley also admits that she was disappointed when the actor playing her husband failed to become erect during a mock marital grappling. This anecdote is reckless candour but serves the main theme of the piece, which is that actresses are encouraged to judge themselves by their ability to arouse men.

      "bodyText": "The BBC marked the death of Sir Alec Guinness by rescreening a Parkinson interview from the late 70s. His conversation was urbane, educated, literate. In general, though, actors are the most difficult interviewees to be found among public professionals. This is because their talent is for disguise and borrowed lines. Expecting an actor to impress as himself imposes the same limitations as insisting the Home Secretary discuss prisons with John Humphrys only in the persona of the Prince of Denmark. For this reason, hopes were low for Channel 4's Starstruck, a four-part series about acting. But while the fault of many interviews with actors is to exaggerate the perils and risks of what they do - that notorious thespian tendency to compare a supporting role in Chekhov to swimming through shark-infested rivers - this series from Emmas Hewitt and Cahusac concentrates on genuine dangers. For example, this week's opening night show focuses on the sexual (and usually sexist) dynamics of casting. Renee Simone, a Hollywood hopeful, is seen living on a regime of sweat-out and water-in as she struggles to lose the final 10 pounds (she's already shed 51) which may bring her closer to the industry's anorexic definition of sexiness. For actresses, it's a paradox of casting directors that the more you vanish the more they see you. Renee's acting career fails to progress, but the agents and advisers around her seem certain to be cast in the next satire from Woody Allen or David Mamet on the movie business. One of the joys of the programme is that Renee's entourage are all fluent in the cinematic gangsterese which is now the lingua franca of Beverly Hills. One of the agents advising Renee specialises in muscular but impenetrable metaphor. \"What she projects is beach-blanket bingo,\" she complains of the still insufficiently skeletal Renee, \"and that's so OUT right now!\" As bad news continues to come in from the gym and the scales, the advisors decide temporarily to abandon the strategy of melting Renee towards leading-lady weight. \"We're going to put glasses on her and have her be a nerd. There's lots of freaks and geeks out there... Until we're ready to unveil the moth, we'll show her as a butterfly or she'll be a swan.\" The beach-blanket bingo butterfly is last seen going nowhere on a gym nasium treadmill and seeking a new agent. Her story is funny - especially the dialogue - but disturbing in its implications. As you watch, you want her to raise two fingers to the Hollywood system but you fear that any digits lifted would soon go down her throat. Renee's English co-star in the documentary is Ella Kenion, an actress from among the middle-higher dress-sizes who watches the big parts going to small women. Filmed auditioning for a Scandinavian emulsion commercial, she is warned by her agent that, in order to win the role of the screen wife watching paint dry, she mustn't come across as \"an eager beaver or a nag\". She nervously checks with the documentary's director that the cardigan she's chosen doesn't make her look \"enormous\". The film's thesis that cinema and television are cast as wet dreams for men isn't new, and could be as thin as the actress who wins out over Ella in selling paint to Swedes. But the power is in the evidential detail of the anecdotes - the casting session where the room was dominated by a giant mattress on which the director conducted horizontal interviews; the ageing famous actor who, as a matter of routine, pressed his erection against the backs of the junior actresses as they waited in the wings; the young American actresses now apparently having plastic surgery as an investment towards possible celebrity. In a therapeutic reversal of professional convention, unknowns take the lead roles in the documentary while stars have soundbite bit-parts. Where the experience of Renee and Ella demonstrates the pseudo-sex of casting, established performers describe the etiquette of faking sex on screen. Withnail And I writer Bruce Robinson recalls his experience as a young actor on a Zefferelli film when - failing to simulate excitement to the degree the maestro wanted - a box of strap-on phalluses of different sizes was proffered by the props man. Fay Ripley from ITV's Cold Feet reveals a kind of Geneva Convention within the profession relating to the rehearsal and performance of sex scenes. Verbal permission should be sought before the tongue is employed and teeth should be cleaned if filming after lunch. Ripley also admits that she was disappointed when the actor playing her husband failed to become erect during a mock marital grappling. This anecdote is reckless candour but serves the main theme of the piece, which is that actresses are encouraged to judge themselves by their ability to arouse men. There are sub-plots which might have been explored - the tendency of actors playing lovers to mate for real, the eating and dieting agonies of the prettier male stars - but, unlike most of the acting profession, the programme consistently works. Starstruck, Wednesday, 9pm, Channel 4. New for old Later this year, writer Robert Hughes updates one of his hit TV series in The Fatal Shore Revisited. And another of his titles - The Shock Of The New - is punningly extended by Piers Gough in his history of British architecture, The Shock Of The Old (Sunday, 8pm, C4). The expert overview has become a controversial form of TV because of industry prejudices about economics (long documentary series consume money), democracy (should so much time be given to a single voice?) and populism (can viewers still appreciate dense ideas?). The biggest difficulty of such a series is deciding the level at which the information should be pitched. In book publishing, there is a clear division between works for experts and populist primers. A TV history must anticipate being watched by both. Any line in the script may be received simultaneously on two different sofas as patronisingly simplistic and excludingly difficult. Andrew Graham Dixon's Renaissance was criticised for being too heavy, Peter Jay's Road To Riches for straining too hard towards lightness. Gough, whose thesis is that British architecture has been consistently innovative, relies on the popularising device of the contemporary parallel, visual and verbal. The Triumphal Arch which admitted the Romans on to Watling Street is aped in the Trafford Shopping Centre. The Roman Baths were \"not so very different from a health club\". The opening episode is best when overturning expectations. Roman mosaic floors are cited as examples of shoddy workmanship. The huts in which Britons lived before the Romans are shown to have been surprisingly sophisticated homes. Gough's encomium to old technology also benefits from the new: graphics - including the 3D computer fly-through - allow an unusually vivid impression of how buildings would have looked. The first episode of The Shock Of The Old doesn't quite earn the cheeky identification with Hughes' art series, but solid foundations are there.",

      "bodyText": "Senior politicians in rival parties yesterday closed ranks behind William Hague's call for tougher penalties for paedophiles after weeks of recurring street violence over the \"naming and shaming\" of sexual offenders against children. Although neither John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, nor Simon Hughes, the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, endorsed the Conservative leader's detailed proposals, they were notably conciliatory in welcoming Mr Hague's suggestions - ideas that should be \"considered\" in the current review of the law, he suggested. After outbreaks of mob violence on some estates where ex-offenders have been housed, notably in Portsmouth, Westminster politicians have been nervously keen to lower the temperature and discourage people from taking the law into their own hands. \"However strong and understandable the emotions of those parents on the Portsmouth housing estate are, the resort to the rule of the mob is absolutely wrong,\" declared Mr Hague. After months when he has sought to make the political weather with a series of populist pronouncements on law- and-order issues, that appeared to draw a distinction between public debate and behaviour that threatens lives and the rule of law. In an article for the Sunday Times, sister paper of the News of the World, whose campaign triggered the recent disturbances, the Tory leader suggested mandatory life sentences for the worst first-time sex offenders, so they would be on licence after release. In a package designed to ally public concern after the murder of Sarah Payne, whose memorial service was held in Guildford Cathedral on Saturday, Mr Hague also proposed: \u0095Obliging those convicted of paedophile offences abroad to register their return to Britain; \u0095Extending supervision beyond the current 10-year maximum and possibly introducing the tagging of offenders for an indefinite period; \u0095Preventing released offenders living near or making contact with victims, \"one of the greatest fears of victims\".

      "body": "<p>World fish stocks are seriously depleted. More and more vessels are chasing fewer and fewer fish, and prices are soaring. Attempts to control overfishing and save the industry from collapse have failed for 30 years. Over the next three days Guardian reporters assess the crisis and ask what can be done </p> <p> Hundreds of thousands of people once dependent on the fishing industry are looking for work and many more are struggling to replace once plentiful food supplies. In Britain alone, sea fishing now employs fewer than 18,000 people. Fifty years ago it was nearly 48,000. </p> <p>Despite bigger boats with better technology, and fleets that are able to range over any stretch of the oceans that cover two-thirds of the planet, world fish catches are going down. Big species such as tuna and cod are disappearing, fished to virtual extinction in many places. </p> <p>Two years ago the UN estimated that nearly half the world's fish stocks were fully exploited and if stocks were to have a chance of recovery one in three of the world's fishing boats would have to stop fishing. Nearly 70% of the world's stocks are in need of urgent management, the UN food and agriculture organisation said. </p> <p>In June all nine of the North Sea commercial fish stocks were described by European scientists as \"outside safe biological limits\" and 67% of all stocks in the north-east Atlantic were severely depleted or in danger of becoming so. And with bigger fish in serious decline smaller species, mackerel, sardines and anchovies, are now the main targets. </p> <p>Much of this fishing effort on smaller species does not go to the shops but to make food for fish farms. With stocks of larger wild fish species decreasing, fish farming is a worldwide boom industry. This year fish farming will provide one quarter of the fish sold for human consumption. </p> <p>But in Europe, in the supermarkets, consumers will hardly notice. Prices are going up and fish is already far more expensive than meat. The varieties have changed too, but there is no obvious shortage of supplies. </p> <p>Europe's stocks of fish are badly depleted because of 20 years of disastrous EU fishing policy. Annual ritual rejections of scientific advice about reducing catches to safeguard stocks, coupled with the ducking of difficult decisions on cutting fleet sizes, have led to mismanagement on a scandalous scale. </p> <p>Elliot Morley, British fisheries minister, admits that politicians have in the past failed to prevent the depletion of stocks, but denies the EU's claim that the UK has been one of the worst offenders. </p> <p>The European commission revealed this summer that the UK fleet has been cut by only 1% in the last three years instead of the 11% the government promised in 1997. Mr Morley says \u00a350m has been spent and the fleet is down. \"Despite what they say we are cutting fishing effort,\" he said. </p> <p>Controlling net sizes, the number of days boats can go to sea and effective satellite monitoring to combat cheating could all play a part in managing stocks, Mr Morley added. </p> <p>But Franz Fischler, the EU fisheries commissioner, is angry that carefully negotiated reductions among 13 fishing nations have failed to make any impact on fishing effort in Europe. He said: \"If anything the increase in technology in that time has made it easier and easier to pinpoint and catch the few fish that remain.\" </p> <p>Cod stocks in the North Sea are down to one tenth of the level of 30 years ago and in danger of extinction. The cod quota this year is 34,301 tonnes. Catches to July 13 were 13,305 tonnes, so low because fishermen just cannot find the fish. </p> <p>But the EU has disguised its chronic inability to manage once abundant fish stocks by using its financial clout to ensure that in Europe there is always enough fish to meet consumer demand. Its fleets now deplete the fisheries of Africa and South America. They deprive local people of food and work, and as they destroy once healthy stocks round the globe, they compete with other rich nations for ever-dwindling supplies. </p> <p>The fishing boats that are stripping the world's seas are not small local vessels seen in picturesque Cornish harbours, but giant floating freezer factories equipped with the most sophisticated radar locaters and satellite technology. Fish have no chance of escape. Entire shoals are surrounded by nets and sucked in for processing and freezing, leaving nothing left in the sea to breed and replenish the stocks. </p> <p>Around \u00a370m a year is paid to developing countries to allow 1,300 European boats to fish in their waters. A similar amount is paid to ship owners in subsidies to build new superboats. The excuse is that these subsidies to shipyards and boat owners finance 20,000 direct fishermen's jobs and another 50,000 in shipbuilding and processing plants in Europe. Mr Morley says this has to end but so far Britain has been outvoted. </p> <p>It is not just a European problem. Around the world from Japan to north America ever bigger trawlers fish and freeze 24 hours a day to take advantage of faraway fishing grounds. They then dock to sell their catch at the nearest port for export to distant cities. Exotic species are being introduced to home markets to satisfy a demand that can no longer be met from fished-out local seas. </p> <p>More than half the fish consumed in Europe is now imported because of depleted home water stocks. The EU has \"bought\" a share of the stocks of 14 African countries and is looking for more. The EU can and does outbid the Russians and other rival fishing fleets for a share of the less developed fisheries. </p> <p>In theory this should be good news for both the European consumer and the long- term health of the fish stocks because the EU claims it believes in sustainable fisheries. But the community's record is appalling, according to its detractors. </p> <p>While the EU argues that \"export\" of the surplus fishing capacity from the North Atlantic by buying fishing rights in developing countries is an extension of a traditional distant water fishing effort of countries such as the UK, Spain and Portugal, there is increasing anger at misuse of the system both in Brussels and in countries that are the \"victims\" of the fleets. </p> <p>Morocco has thrown out the EU from its waters after years of allowing exploitation by Spanish boats. The EU has paid the Spanish compensation and told them to tie up their boats while they try to buy more rights elsewhere. Chile responded by closing its harbours to EU vessels. </p> <p>Euan Dunn, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds' fisheries officer, said: \"We are exporting our own mismanagement of Europe's fish stocks to the developing world. We are moving from stock to stock, systematically destroying it and moving on to the next. The EU fishing policy stinks and there will soon be very few fish to catch.\" </p> <p>Evidence is mounting that once a fish stock is overfished it may never recover. The best example is cod in the Grand Banks off Newfoundland, once the most prolific fishery in the world. </p> <p>Despite repeated warnings from scientists, the politicians allowed fishing to continue until the cod stocks collapsed. The fishery was closed in 1992 to allow stocks to recover, throwing more than 40,000 people out of work. </p> <p>At worst the fishery was expected to be closed for three years. Eight years later the cod have not come back. </p> <p>There are a number of theories why this should be, from the wrong water temperature for breeding, to seals eating them, but the most likely is that the cod's niche in the sea has been taken by other species. Predators such as dogfish eat their eggs and they may never recover. </p> <p>Despite the fact that cod stocks continued to decline, the politicians in Canada refused to take scientific advice to keep the fishery closed, and suppressed a report it had commissioned that recommended the cod be declared an endangered species. </p> <p>And there is increasing evidence that once cod are taken out of the eco-system the balance changes. </p> <p>In both Newfoundland and on the shores of the UK, where cod stocks are in dire straits, shrimps and longuistinas, the food that cod usually eat, have ballooned in numbers. In Scotland, for example, this group of prawn type species - nephrops as they are known - are now as important a catch as haddock, and sold as scampi are far more numerous and valuable than cod. </p> <p>This targeting of smaller and smaller but suddenly more numerous creatures, once the prey of larger fish which have nearly all been caught, is called \"fishing down the food chain\". Initially it leads to higher catches but then that source too is exhausted. </p> <p>The Norwegians have recently suggested harvesting the plankton, the smallest living organisms of the ocean which include the larvae of many fish and shellfish, in order to provide food for fish farms. </p> <p>Mr Dunn said: \"This is taking fishing down the food chain to its ultimate conclusion and wiping out all stocks at source, literally emptying the oceans of life and preventing any recovery. It cannot be allowed to happen.\"</p>",

The cod quota this year is 34,301 tonnes. Catches to July 13 were 13,305 tonnes, so low because fishermen just cannot find the fish. But the EU has disguised its chronic inability to manage once abundant fish stocks by using its financial clout to ensure that in Europe there is always enough fish to meet consumer demand. Its fleets now deplete the fisheries of Africa and South America. They deprive local people of food and work, and as they destroy once healthy stocks round the globe, they compete with other rich nations for ever-dwindling supplies. The fishing boats that are stripping the world's seas are not small local vessels seen in picturesque Cornish harbours, but giant floating freezer factories equipped with the most sophisticated radar locaters and satellite technology. Fish have no chance of escape. Entire shoals are surrounded by nets and sucked in for processing and freezing, leaving nothing left in the sea to breed and replenish the stocks. Around \u00a370m a year is paid to developing countries to allow 1,300 European boats to fish in their waters. A similar amount is paid to ship owners in subsidies to build new superboats. The excuse is that these subsidies to shipyards and boat owners finance 20,000 direct fishermen's jobs and another 50,000 in shipbuilding and processing plants in Europe. Mr Morley says this has to end but so far Britain has been outvoted. It is not just a European problem. Around the world from Japan to north America ever bigger trawlers fish and freeze 24 hours a day to take advantage of faraway fishing grounds. They then dock to sell their catch at the nearest port for export to distant cities. Exotic species are being introduced to home markets to satisfy a demand that can no longer be met from fished-out local seas. More than half the fish consumed in Europe is now imported because of depleted home water stocks. The EU has \"bought\" a share of the stocks of 14 African countries and is looking for more. The EU can and does outbid the Russians and other rival fishing fleets for a share of the less developed fisheries. In theory this should be good news for both the European consumer and the long- term health of the fish stocks because the EU claims it believes in sustainable fisheries. But the community's record is appalling, according to its detractors. While the EU argues that \"export\" of the surplus fishing capacity from the North Atlantic by buying fishing rights in developing countries is an extension of a traditional distant water fishing effort of countries such as the UK, Spain and Portugal, there is increasing anger at misuse of the system both in Brussels and in countries that are the \"victims\" of the fleets. Morocco has thrown out the EU from its waters after years of allowing exploitation by Spanish boats. The EU has paid the Spanish compensation and told them to tie up their boats while they try to buy more rights elsewhere. Chile responded by closing its harbours to EU vessels. Euan Dunn, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds' fisheries officer, said: \"We are exporting our own mismanagement of Europe's fish stocks to the developing world. We are moving from stock to stock, systematically destroying it and moving on to the next. The EU fishing policy stinks and there will soon be very few fish to catch.\" Evidence is mounting that once a fish stock is overfished it may never recover. The best example is cod in the Grand Banks off Newfoundland, once the most prolific fishery in the world. Despite repeated warnings from scientists, the politicians allowed fishing to continue until the cod stocks collapsed. The fishery was closed in 1992 to allow stocks to recover, throwing more than 40,000 people out of work. At worst the fishery was expected to be closed for three years. Eight years later the cod have not come back. There are a number of theories why this should be, from the wrong water temperature for breeding, to seals eating them, but the most likely is that the cod's niche in the sea has been taken by other species. Predators such as dogfish eat their eggs and they may never recover. Despite the fact that cod stocks continued to decline, the politicians in Canada refused to take scientific advice to keep the fishery closed, and suppressed a report it had commissioned that recommended the cod be declared an endangered species. And there is increasing evidence that once cod are taken out of the eco-system the balance changes. In both Newfoundland and on the shores of the UK, where cod stocks are in dire straits, shrimps and longuistinas, the food that cod usually eat, have ballooned in numbers. In Scotland, for example, this group of prawn type species - nephrops as they are known - are now as important a catch as haddock, and sold as scampi are far more numerous and valuable than cod. This targeting of smaller and smaller but suddenly more numerous creatures, once the prey of larger fish which have nearly all been caught, is called \"fishing down the food chain\". Initially it leads to higher catches but then that source too is exhausted. The Norwegians have recently suggested harvesting the plankton, the smallest living organisms of the ocean which include the larvae of many fish and shellfish, in order to provide food for fish farms. Mr Dunn said: \"This is taking fishing down the food chain to its ultimate conclusion and wiping out all stocks at source, literally emptying the oceans of life and preventing any recovery. It cannot be allowed to happen.\"",

Cheik, 16, was one of seven fishermen who had pushed out the small canoe-shaped fishing boat through the waves from the beach in Mbour, a dusty fishing village 50 miles south of Dakar on the west African coast. </p> <p>The men had planned to be at sea for three days - a long time in a boat with no shelter on the unpredictable Atlantic waters. But the fish that were once plentiful nearer to the shore have disappeared, and they have to travel further afield to find the shoals. </p> <p>It happened while the crew was sleeping. One moment they were curled up on the piles of oily nets, the next they were in the water, the pirogue splintered into matchwood. </p> <p>The steel hull of an industrial trawler, one of the many from the developed world that now ply their trade in the waters off the west African coast, had cut the small pirogue in half. The men clung on to pieces of the wreckage, calling out to each other, as the trawler ploughed on towards the horizon. </p> <p>As the waters settled the men swam together, knowing their only chance of survival was to stay close together. But there was no sign of Cheik; his crewmates said he had tied himself to the side of the boat to guard against a freak Atlantic wave tossing him overboard during the night. When the trawler hit he had been unable to free himself and was sucked under the water. They never found his body. </p> <p>The six survivors spent a cold night clinging to the driftwood, talking and praying to stop from falling asleep and slipping under the swell. The next morning the men were rescued by another pirogue fishing the same waters. </p> <p>Cheik's brother Ousseymon had suffered a serious gash to his leg in the collision, but the hard economics of life for the fishermen of Senegal meant the rescue boat could not return to Mbour until the crew had caught enough fish to cover the cost of the trip. By the time they reached shore nothing could be done to heal the suppurating wound and his leg had to be amputated. </p> <p>Anta Gueye waited on the beach, hoping her missing son had been picked up by another fishing boat. By the fourth day all hope was gone. </p> <p>For the fishermen of Senegal incidents like these have become a common occurrence. Arona Diagne, who is president of the Senegalese independent fishworkers' association, CNPS, said that more than 300 men have been lost in accidents with trawlers in the waters around Mbour over the last two decades. </p> <p>With the rapid depletion of fish stocks in Europe and Asia, trawlers from France, Spain, Italy, Japan and Taiwan as well as the former Soviet republics have targeted the fertile waters off west Africa to keep pace with their countries insatiable appetite for fish. Seventy-eight EU boats are licensed to fish in Senegal in a deal that nets the government in Dakar \u00a37.5m a year. </p> <p>The Mbour fishermen rarely know where the boats responsible for the accidents come from. Often they are fishing illegally inside an area reserved for the artisan fishermen, but the boats cover their identity numbers with mud. They turn off their lights so they cannot be seen from the shore at night, with the inevitable result they cannot be seen by the pirogues either. According to the local fishermen, when the accidents happen, the trawlers never stop. </p> <p>Even if they do identify the boats fishing illegally, they are rarely penalised. \"The industrial boats are very powerful with a lot of money and they can buy their way out of trouble,\" Mr Diagne, who is still an active fisherman in Mbour, said. \"They corrupt the persons who are meant to stop them. The bribe is everything.\" </p> <p>For the fishermen of Mbour it is not just their lives that are at stake but their livelihoods. </p> <p>The Joola is one of Mbour's largest pirogues and its catch supports a number of families in the town. Her crew, including children and old men, had set out early one morning when the sun was giving off a gentle warmth. Now it felt like razor blades on the skin. </p> <p>At the tiller was Doudou Gaye, 30, who, like generations of his family before him, has been fishing off the coast of Senegal since he was a boy. While the men brewed strong tea on a charcoal fire burning inside a car wheel hub, a look out kept a sharp eye on the ocean surface hoping to spot the tell-tale dark circle created by a shoal of sardines. </p> <p>A few miles off the coast the pirogue passed a fleet of trawlers, brimming with the latest technology to help find the fish, and trailing mile upon mile of nets. </p> <p>Apart from the addition of an outboard motor, boats almost identical to the Joola could have been seen in Senegal hundreds of years ago. </p> <p>The crew rely on the human eye and their knowledge of the sea to find the fish. But as the shore submerged to a shadow on the horizon the captain was getting restless. Fuel for the trip cost \u00a370 and with a quarter of the day gone there was no sign of the prize that would pay the bill. </p> <p>\"It used to be we could catch what we wanted when we wanted,\" he said. \"But now many of the fish are gone, some species altogether, and what we used to be able to catch in an afternoon now might take as long as three days.\" </p> <p>In the local dialect, Wolof, they call the sardine \" yaboye\" - fish of the poor. For 85% of the population of Senegal it is a staple part of their diet, providing a vital source of protein for the millions who cannot afford to buy meat. </p> <p>Its importance makes it the cornerstone of the artisan fishing industry, which directly or indirectly employs more than 400,000 people in Senegal - roughly 10% of the population - from the fishermen to the women who gut, smoke, boil and sell the catch. </p> <p>But like the higher quality fish that used to proliferate along the west African coast the number of sardines have been decreasing at an alarming rate due to the influx of industrial trawlers. The sardine is a migratory fish that makes its way up and down the coast of west Africa, passing through the territorial waters of Mauritania before they reach Senegal. The EU has an agreement with the government allowing 22 trawlers of unlimited capacity to fish the Mauritanian coastal waters. </p> <p>The main beneficiary of the deal has been the Dutch pelagic fleet and its new breed of \"super trawler\" - 144 metres long, roughly the size of a cross channel ferry, capable of carrying 7,000 tonnes of fish with a range of 22,000 miles. The Dutch boats are the biggest trawlers ever made and are equipped with state-of-the-art fish-finding and winch technology able to deliver more than three miles of net into the ocean. </p> <p>Despite the EU's stated policy of sustainable fishing, the fishermen of Senegal say the insatiable appetite of the trawlers are decimating the sardine population. </p> <p>In a cruel and twisted irony, many of the sardines caught by the trawlers are processed and canned on Las Palmas in the Canary islands, before being shipped back to within a few miles of where they were originally caught and sold on the local stalls. </p> <p>On board the Joola the lookout finally raised his arm to signal he had spotted a dark stain on the surface of the ocean. As the pirogue got closer to the shoal, the men began to pay out the nets while the captain turned hard on the tiller, circling the fish until they were completely surrounded by the nets. </p> <p>On a signal, the four youngest members of the crew, aged between seven and 10, leapt into the water and began splashing around for all they were worth. The men on board banged the side of the boat and shouted at the water, trying to scare the fish away from their escape route beneath them. </p> <p>As the men began pulling on the nets the boat tipped almost to vertical and water splashed over the gunwales, filling the bottom of the pirogue. Hauling on the ropes, the circle of net became smaller and smaller. </p> <p>Eventually, all that was left was a small circle of netting. But when the men pulled it over the side it contained little more than a handful of sardines, two octopuses and a squid. </p> <p>After four more punishing hours at sea the men of the Joola finally hauled in a net full of fish, and the boat reverberated with the sound of flapping sardines. </p> <p>But as the pirogue arrived at the beach and a seething mass of merchants bid for the catch, the captain was not happy. \"It was not enough,\" he said with a shrug of his shoulders and a disconsolate look at the fish. </p> <p>There appears to be no solution to the problem of Africa's dwindling fish stocks. The Centre of Research for the Development of Intermediary Fishing Technologies (Credetip), a non-governmental organisation set up to protect the rights of artisan fishermen throughout west Africa, wants to see the west African coastal countries adopt a common policy to fishing agreements. </p> <p>Youssoupha Gueye, the director of Credetip in Dakar, believes the only way to protect one of the continent's most important resources is for the countries to work together to insure stocks remain at sustainable levels. </p> <p>But for the governments of the region, ending the fishing agreements with the EU and other countries is not an option. Senegal is indebted to the world bank to the tune of $3.8bn and the money from the fishing contracts are a vital source of hard currency. Last year Senegal spent $323m servicing its debts - $311m more than the EU pays to plunder one of the country's only natural resources. </p> <p>The internal pressures on the fish stocks have grown astronomically in the last decade. A prolonged drought in the Sahel region has forced large swathes of the population to migrate to the coast in search of food and work. When they cannot find jobs in the seething metropolis of Dakar, many try their hand at fishing, increasing to breaking point the pressure on fish stocks. </p> <p>\"The fishing agreements are a short term solution to a long term problem,\" Mr Gueye said. \"In Senegal we have a saying: it is better to learn how to catch a fish than to be given a fish every day. At the moment the EU just gives us a fish.\" </p> <p>Arona Diagne wants to see the fishing agreements ended indefinitely before the way of life that has provided for his family for generations disappears. \"Fishing is in our blood. If we have no fish how can we survive,\" he said. </p> <p>But for the artisan fishermen of Senegal the day when their nets are empty for good may be fast approaching.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The scientists who led the world in cloning animals are withdrawing from controversial research into pigs that could provide organs for human transplant. </p> <p>Just as the government cautiously prepares to endorse the use of human embryos for research into \"therapeutic cloning\", Ian Wilmut of the Roslin Institute, near Edinburgh, which partners a commercial venture with the US biotechnology giant Geron, revealed that research into pigs-for-transplant was to end at Roslin. </p> <p>The decision follows widely voiced fears that new diseases could be passed to humans through the use of animal organs. </p> <p>On Wednesday the government is expected to publish a report by the chief medical officer, Liam Donaldson, giving the all-clear to very limited use of human embryos for studies which could end in an entirely different kind of tissue transplant. The final decision will be left to a free vote of MPs. </p> <p>Humans are made of more than 200 kinds of specialised cells for nerves, skin, liver, heart, blood, bone, and so on. All of these stem from a ball of embryonic cells that develops to form a foetus. There is a worldwide race to harness embryonic stem cells to repair nerve damage and halt degenerative diseases - and eventually to replace failing organs. </p> <p>In the meantime, victims of heart, liver and kidney failure are dying because there are too few human transplant donors, and groups in Britain and the US have been working to develop a line of genetically engineered pigs with human-compatible hearts to provide a steady supply of organs that would survive immediate rejection. </p> <p>Although firms such as Imutran, the Cambridge-based group, and more lately Geron Bio-Med at Roslin and in the US have been working on \"xenotransplantation\" - transplants from a foreign source - the British government has blocked any human trials. There have been increasing fears that unknown pig viruses might enter the human population. Microbes that do no apparent harm to one natural host can wreak havoc when they transfer to another. </p> <p>Prof Wilmut said the decision to end pig research was disappointing. He told Scotland on Sunday: \"We are reducing pig work. It has not quite finished but it will be before long. </p> <p>\"I think the concern is mainly unknown viruses. That's the frightening thing. If you know what the disease is you know how to look for it.\" </p> <p>David White, co-founder of Imutran, who developed Astrid, the world's first pig with a human-compatible heart, said he was disappointed to hear the Scottish group was no longer in the field. \"The technology Ian Wilmut and his group developed is a major advance and I think the question of the safety issues can be resolved.\" </p> <p>But even as one door closed for Roslin, another is about to open.

      "bodyText": "The scientists who led the world in cloning animals are withdrawing from controversial research into pigs that could provide organs for human transplant. Just as the government cautiously prepares to endorse the use of human embryos for research into \"therapeutic cloning\", Ian Wilmut of the Roslin Institute, near Edinburgh, which partners a commercial venture with the US biotechnology giant Geron, revealed that research into pigs-for-transplant was to end at Roslin. The decision follows widely voiced fears that new diseases could be passed to humans through the use of animal organs. On Wednesday the government is expected to publish a report by the chief medical officer, Liam Donaldson, giving the all-clear to very limited use of human embryos for studies which could end in an entirely different kind of tissue transplant. The final decision will be left to a free vote of MPs. Humans are made of more than 200 kinds of specialised cells for nerves, skin, liver, heart, blood, bone, and so on. All of these stem from a ball of embryonic cells that develops to form a foetus. There is a worldwide race to harness embryonic stem cells to repair nerve damage and halt degenerative diseases - and eventually to replace failing organs. In the meantime, victims of heart, liver and kidney failure are dying because there are too few human transplant donors, and groups in Britain and the US have been working to develop a line of genetically engineered pigs with human-compatible hearts to provide a steady supply of organs that would survive immediate rejection. Although firms such as Imutran, the Cambridge-based group, and more lately Geron Bio-Med at Roslin and in the US have been working on \"xenotransplantation\" - transplants from a foreign source - the British government has blocked any human trials. There have been increasing fears that unknown pig viruses might enter the human population. Microbes that do no apparent harm to one natural host can wreak havoc when they transfer to another. Prof Wilmut said the decision to end pig research was disappointing. He told Scotland on Sunday: \"We are reducing pig work. It has not quite finished but it will be before long. \"I think the concern is mainly unknown viruses. That's the frightening thing. If you know what the disease is you know how to look for it.\" David White, co-founder of Imutran, who developed Astrid, the world's first pig with a human-compatible heart, said he was disappointed to hear the Scottish group was no longer in the field. \"The technology Ian Wilmut and his group developed is a major advance and I think the question of the safety issues can be resolved.\" But even as one door closed for Roslin, another is about to open. Geron Bio-Med was formed to marry the technique that led to Scotland's Dolly the sheep with the research into stem cells pioneered by the Geron Corporation. The usage of donated embryos in Britain is strictly controlled, and is only permitted for fertility research. But for more than a year, British scientists have been hoping for permission to use surplus embryos to provide stem cells which could provide the basis of a new kind of cure. On Wednesday, they are likely to get it, providing MPs back the Donaldson report in a free vote. The cautious approach implied in a free vote will disappoint some MPs who would like to see Tony Blair being \"bold in defence of science\" and whipping Labour MPs through the lobbies after first exposing the hollowness of the mainly-religious opposition.",

An NBC opinion poll published yesterday shows that Al Gore has narrowed George W Bush's lead to just three points - 44% to 41% - in this year's presidential race. While other recent polls suggest Mr Bush's lead could be as much as 10 points, Mr Gore's selection of Mr Lieberman as his vice-presidential running-mate last week has clearly stopped the slide to the Republicans. Nearly a quarter of voters polled said they now felt more favourable towards Mr Gore because of his choice of the first Jew to be nominated on the presidential ticket of a major American political party. But it was Mr Lieberman's stance as a critic of the moral values of the television, music and movie industries - and of President Clinton - which was in the spotlight yesterday as the senator was given pride of place in the Gore campaign's weekend strategy. The contrast between Mr Lieberman's moral strictures and the intensive Democratic fundraising effort in Hollywood this week could hardly be greater. The start of the convention has been dominated by the presence in Los Angeles of Bill and Hillary Clinton, both of whom will address the convention tonight, and who have spent the weekend raising millions of dollars for their own projects from big name donors. The wider issue in Los Angeles is whether the convention marks the end of a decade in Democratic politics in which the party has moved sometimes unwillingly into the centre, campaigning against some of its traditional ideas in an attempt to outmanoeuvre the Republicans, a form of politics at which Mr Clinton has excelled. The build-up to the convention has been overshadowed by a row over Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez's wish - now thwarted by the Democratic high command - to hold a fundraising event at Hugh Hefner's Playboy Mansion. Pre-convention tension increased yesterday when a demonstrator slipped through the city's huge police cordon and dump a vanload of manure outside a downtown hotel.

The strikes came amid verbal attacks by Iraq on what it called \"the hireling rulers in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait\". They also followed a double public relations coup in which Saddam Hussein last week welcomed the president of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez - the first democratically elected head of state to visit Baghdad since the 1991 war - and the president of Indonesia announced that he will shortly travel to Iraq. The first allied raid, on Friday night, struck Samawa, 170 miles south of Baghdad. Iraq said a warehouse containing food and other material imported under the UN's oil-for-food programme was hit. Two people died, 19 were injured and six houses badly damaged, it said. A second raid on Saturday night hit the railway station in Samawa, causing some injuries, the official Iraqi news agency said. But the US insisted that allied aircraft had targeted Iraqi command posts and surface-to-air missile sites after Iraq opened fire on planes patrolling the southern no-fly zone. The Pentagon spokesman Rick Thomas said: \"We seek to avoid injuries to civilians and damage to civilian facilities.\" Allied planes have frequently bombed targets in the no-fly zones since Baghdad stepped up its defiance of the western-imposed restrictions in December 1998. Iraq says around 300 civilians have been killed and 900 wounded in these attacks. America disputes these figures and accuses President Saddam of deliberately placing military sites close to civilian areas. In London, a Foreign Office spokesman said yesterday that strikes on Iraq were only carried out \"in response to direct threats to our aircraft\". But the Iraqi news agency described the strikes as a response to a speech last week in which President Saddam said his Gulf neighbours had \"sold their souls\" to the US and Israel. In a protest letter to the UN, the foreign minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf accused the Saudi and Kuwaiti governments of \"providing logistical support for the American and British forces, making them contributing partners in the aggression\".

      "bodyText": "President Clinton's dilemma over whether to press ahead with a $60bn (\u00a340bn) missile defence system intensified yesterday with claims that the US covered up the loss of a nuclear bomb near an airbase that would form part of the shield. One of four hydrogen bombs on a B52 aircraft that crashed several kilometres off the Thule airbase in Greenland was probably never recovered, according to classified documents. \"US authorities hid the disappearance of this nuclear bomb on Danish territory from the Danish authorities,\" said Mogens Bosen, leader of a group of employees on the airbase. Denmark handles Greenland's foreign, security and defence policy. \"Detective work by former Thule workers indicates an unexploded nuclear bomb probably still lies on the seabed off Thule,\" said the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten. Denmark was not told about the missing bomb but the air crash 32 years ago still caused a rift in relations between the US and its Nato ally at the time. The US secretly stored about 12,000 nuclear weapons in 18 countries and nine territories at the height of the cold war, including several that forbade the practice, including Japan, Taiwan and Greenland. An official report on the accident, obtained by the Thule staff, said nothing was found of the bomb other than a parachute. But a state department document on the crash, dated five months later, said all the weapons on the crashed bomber had been accounted for, without specifying whether that meant they had been recovered. The US told the Danish government that clean-up work had been completed and abandoned the search for the bomb, said the newspaper. Politicians in Greenland were opposed to making Thule a link in the missile defence chain even before the latest allegations, which will not assist the cause of senior state department officials who will go there in seven days time to discuss the airbase's putative role in the shield. The claims come when President Clinton is under pressure to decide whether to go ahead with a national missile defence shield aimed at thwarting \"rogue\" nations, under which definition it includes North Korea, Iraq, Iran and Libya. US intelligence believes that by 2005 North Korea will have a missile capable of reaching North America. Mr Clinton is being pressed by the scheme's advocates to approve the first step, approval of a radar installation in Alaska, by the autumn if the 2005 deadline is to be met. But the system has failed in two of its three tests - the most recent was last month - and has united many of the firm and more tentative friends of the US in opposition to it. Russia says it breaches the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty, China fears that its limited supplies of the weapon would be negated, and European allies believe world stability would be damaged. But Mr Clinton, in the final months of his presidency, is important now only to the timing of the missile system and the candidates to succeed him have been vying to outdo each other in their enthusiasm for it. George W Bush, 10 points ahead in the latest poll, told the Republican convention where he accepted his nomination: \"At the earliest possible date, my administration will deploy missile defences to guard against attack and blackmail. Now is the time not to defend outdated treaties but to defend the American people.\" His opponent, vice-president Al Gore, has said: \"We must adequately prepare for homeland defence, protecting critical infrastructure, combating terrorism and developing the technology for a national missile defence system to protect against ballistic missile attacks from rogue nations.\" The Pentagon said a week ago it was still assessing the latest failed test, when the projectile that was meant to take out a warhead failed to separate from its booster rocket. Defence secretary Bill Cohen said he would brief Mr Clinton \"within the next few weeks\". US authorities would say nothing yesterday about the crashed B52 or the missing bomb.",

But in an age of socket covers, stair gates and sterilised toys, could we be producing a generation that is unable to deal with the risks of everyday life?

      "byline": "Kate Figes",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Sarah Payne's murder will have triggered alarm bells in homes up and down the country. Once again we are reminded of the need to keep our children close, constantly in view, for the loss of a child is every parent's ultimate nightmare. Few of us can imagine the pain of loss with which Sarah's parents and brothers and sister must be living. Like countless other parents I have felt the need to remind my children of age-old maxims - don't talk to strangers, never accept sweets from strangers, and never, ever go anywhere with anyone unexpectedly. Allowing my 11-year-old out to walk the dog alone for half an hour suddenly takes on a darker, more threatening hue and I wonder whether it's wise to be letting her out at all.</p> <p>When child death was a common cultural experience, devastating but seemingly determined by God, parents had little choice but to accept that a child's welfare was out of their control. Now we know better. We know more about the nature of infection, rely more on medical advances and expect our children to survive us. We do everything humanly possible to keep our precious children safe, with stair gates, car seats, socket covers and curly flexes for the kettle.</p> <p>Conscientious mothers regularly detoxify kitchen surfaces, even toys, in order to cut down risk of infection. We never let them out of our sight, drive them to schools where they are locked in for their own welfare and we never stop telling them to \"be careful\".</p> <p>It is largely because of our success at keeping them alive that all those other more hidden and uncontrollable hazards, or chance happenings of life seem disproportionately threatening in the public imagination. Paedophilia, child murder, meningitis, even the carcinogenic properties of sunshine preoccupy us because they are beyond our control. But are we actually doing more harm than good through this obsessive, modern need to keep them so close and so safe when the real world they have to negotiate is riddled with risk, danger and, of course, the fickle finger of fate?</p> <p>Detoxification, lunchboxes made from antibacterial plastic and banning pets may limit infection but exposure to some dirt is essential to build up immunity. Structured play and learning may be good for them educationally but there is also evidence that too much can limit their imagination. Children who are left alone at times learn self-sufficiency, the ability to create something out of nothing. Watching over them constantly is impossible but countless parents try in order to protect them from hurting themselves, in spite of the fact that minor accidents teach small children far more than words.</p> <p>The toddler who has never been allowed to fall over cannot find the balance required in order to be able to stand properly. The child who has never touched the side of a kettle cannot really understand the meaning of \"it's hot\". The child who is driven everywhere never learns how to cross a road with an adult before he or she attempts it alone. They also never learn how to buy a bus ticket or how to rub shoulders with silent, anonymous strangers.</p> <p>Our relentless concern for our children means that we can easily fall into the trap of overprotecting them and that can have damaging consequences for their development. Children who have everything done for them never learn how to do things for themselves. \"We don't want children to fight their own battles, even when they are very little,\" says child psychotherapist Asha Phillips. \"When there's a problem with friends or teachers we step in too quickly to try and sort things out for them and that means that children do not know how to solve social difficulties for themselves.\"</p> <p>The same is true of risk. Without an understanding of risk, there is no achievement, there is no sense of the need to strive for things and no sense of how to cope when they fail.</p> <p>Risk is crucial to life - we risk failure or humiliation with every audition or job interview, we risk physical accident with sports and competitions but that does not mean that we shouldn't try. Children have to be allowed to fail, to face risk, even danger at times, in order to recognise the emotions triggered by those events, find ways of coping with them and develop their own judgment.</p> <p>When a small child loses a parent in the playground, even for a few moments, he or she may feel fear and anxiety and have to stop and consider what to do. If, when he finds that parent, words are used to give the experience meaning: \"Were you worried when you couldn't find me in the playground?\" Such an open-ended question allows the child to understand that these feelings are normal and solutions can be discussed for the next time a child feels similar anxiety; for example: \"Don't panic, stay where you are and I'll find you, or ask another mummy close by to help you find me.\" But if that parent is so over-anxious about the child's welfare, if she assumes that he must have been frightened because she was, the child learns only that the big bad world is a place to fear, a place where he cannot survive without her and strategies for survival are likely to be thin on the ground.</p> <p>Loving parents like to eliminate as many negatives as possible from a child's life. We soothe upsets, we like to see them happy. But children who have never been allowed to feel negative emotions lack the resources to deal with bigger difficulties as they get older. They are denied opportunities to develop internal controls or to trust their own instincts.</p> <p>Jeannie Milligan is a psychotherapist who works in the adolescent department at the Tavistock Centre, London. \"I see kids who have a distorted view of life as something traumatic has happened to them and that really interferes with their capacity to develop judgment on a solid basis. \"They lose their reference points if they have had too many odd experiences without parents talking to them adequately about what is going on. But, if you flip the coin, there is a similar paralysis for children who have always had their parents step in to protect them. It's about building up a repertoire of experience as you grow up, coming to recognise what fits with your best view of your world and what is at odds with it, and each child does that uniquely.\"</p> <p>When children haven't developed a solid basis of judgment in the face of risk, adolescence may be harder to deal with. In fact, we may be unwittingly sowing the seeds for greater health-risk behaviour in teenagers due to our reluctance to let them experiment as younger children. They have to be allowed to develop their own internal controls and that comes from practice and experimentation. Parents cannot stop teenagers from taking drugs or drinking too much; they have to learn their limits for themselves. \"Taking risks is part of growing up and doing things that you haven't done before and so may be creative,\" says Milligan. \"But you also need to develop a sense of when pushing those boundaries stops being creative and becomes disturbing or self destructive. You also need to develop the confidence to know that you don't have to go along with things and that is true for a whole range of things, from whether to go out with a boy, where you need to trust your own instinct but you also have to have a go, to resisting heroin.\"</p> <p>If you are used to having everything done for you, how then do you manage the inexorable drive for autonomy that is integral to adolescence and cope with growing up? \"How do you leave home, cross the road alone or cope with the painful fact that a friend has let you down or betrayed you?\"says Milligan.</p> <p>And if children are so emotionally embroiled and dependent on parents for survival, the normal rejections and rebellions of adolescence become more complex, the emotional loss of childhood harder to bear. \"It is harder for over-protected teenagers,\" says Asha Phillips, \"partly because you feel that your parents know and control everything and partly because you need them more. You've been protected all the time and therefore don't want to lose that protection through conflict or rebellion.\"</p> <p>Such adolescents are also likely to be more secretive about their activities and find it harder to confide in, or seek guidance from, parents in case their honesty provokes upset, misunderstanding or rejection.</p> <p>We give our children so many mixed messages. We tell them not to talk to strangers yet they see us talking to strangers every day. Media obsessions with sex, drugs, violence and television soaps create the impression that daily life is awash with trauma and extreme danger and children can pick up a distorted view of life, unless given adequate explanations by parents. Yet we shy away from these subjects, reluctant to discuss them in case they should shock, frighten or offend. Without adequate discussion, children have no way of knowing that the murder of Sarah Payne was an extremely rare case. Last year, five children between the ages of five and 14 were murdered in England and Wales. \"We're constantly conveying to them that other people are untrustworthy and that only the family is safe, which often isn't true,\" says Phillips. Children are statistically at much greater risk of being abused or hurt when they are at home alone with a stepfather or Uncle Fred than by strangers.</p> <p>Our need to preserve childhood as something precious and innocent means that we have a tendency to romanticise it. But we have a duty as parents to bring up children so that they can survive and succeed within the world as it is, rather than in the idealistic fantasies of our imaginings.</p> <p>Separating our own emotions from their needs is crucial. Never letting them out alone may appease our own fears and anxieties but such a strategy fails children and denies them a fundamental human right to explore and discover for themselves. From the moment the umbilical cord is cut, parents embark on a slow process of letting the child go. There is weaning, learning to walk away, spending that first night away from home and going to school. Allowing a child out alone feels like a monumental step to take when there is so much danger out there to threaten their welfare. But, gradually, they have to go.</p> <p>When my 11-year-old daughter is 10 minutes late back from walking the dog, I imagine her being run over by a car and then abducted by paedophiles. I am at the window waiting for her to return. Sometimes I even walk out to the corner to see if I can spot them walking home. When she knocks, I smile as I open the door and have to stifle the words on the tip of my tongue (Where have you been? I've been worried sick ...) because this is my panic, my anxiety, my concern and not hers. She has had a great time, as she should have.</p> <p>Kate Figes is the author of Life After Birth, published by Penguin, priced \u00a37.99.</p>",

They have to be allowed to develop their own internal controls and that comes from practice and experimentation. Parents cannot stop teenagers from taking drugs or drinking too much; they have to learn their limits for themselves. \"Taking risks is part of growing up and doing things that you haven't done before and so may be creative,\" says Milligan. \"But you also need to develop a sense of when pushing those boundaries stops being creative and becomes disturbing or self destructive. You also need to develop the confidence to know that you don't have to go along with things and that is true for a whole range of things, from whether to go out with a boy, where you need to trust your own instinct but you also have to have a go, to resisting heroin.\" If you are used to having everything done for you, how then do you manage the inexorable drive for autonomy that is integral to adolescence and cope with growing up? \"How do you leave home, cross the road alone or cope with the painful fact that a friend has let you down or betrayed you?\"says Milligan. And if children are so emotionally embroiled and dependent on parents for survival, the normal rejections and rebellions of adolescence become more complex, the emotional loss of childhood harder to bear. \"It is harder for over-protected teenagers,\" says Asha Phillips, \"partly because you feel that your parents know and control everything and partly because you need them more. You've been protected all the time and therefore don't want to lose that protection through conflict or rebellion.\" Such adolescents are also likely to be more secretive about their activities and find it harder to confide in, or seek guidance from, parents in case their honesty provokes upset, misunderstanding or rejection. We give our children so many mixed messages. We tell them not to talk to strangers yet they see us talking to strangers every day. Media obsessions with sex, drugs, violence and television soaps create the impression that daily life is awash with trauma and extreme danger and children can pick up a distorted view of life, unless given adequate explanations by parents. Yet we shy away from these subjects, reluctant to discuss them in case they should shock, frighten or offend. Without adequate discussion, children have no way of knowing that the murder of Sarah Payne was an extremely rare case. Last year, five children between the ages of five and 14 were murdered in England and Wales. \"We're constantly conveying to them that other people are untrustworthy and that only the family is safe, which often isn't true,\" says Phillips. Children are statistically at much greater risk of being abused or hurt when they are at home alone with a stepfather or Uncle Fred than by strangers. Our need to preserve childhood as something precious and innocent means that we have a tendency to romanticise it. But we have a duty as parents to bring up children so that they can survive and succeed within the world as it is, rather than in the idealistic fantasies of our imaginings. Separating our own emotions from their needs is crucial. Never letting them out alone may appease our own fears and anxieties but such a strategy fails children and denies them a fundamental human right to explore and discover for themselves. From the moment the umbilical cord is cut, parents embark on a slow process of letting the child go. There is weaning, learning to walk away, spending that first night away from home and going to school. Allowing a child out alone feels like a monumental step to take when there is so much danger out there to threaten their welfare. But, gradually, they have to go. When my 11-year-old daughter is 10 minutes late back from walking the dog, I imagine her being run over by a car and then abducted by paedophiles. I am at the window waiting for her to return. Sometimes I even walk out to the corner to see if I can spot them walking home. When she knocks, I smile as I open the door and have to stifle the words on the tip of my tongue (Where have you been? I've been worried sick ...) because this is my panic, my anxiety, my concern and not hers. She has had a great time, as she should have.

      "body": "<p>The Beehive on the Paulsgrove estate in Portsmouth is friendlier than it looks. Described by one local as \"rough as arseholes\" the landlord prefers to refer to it as a family pub. There are goats, rabbits and birds in the back for children to look at and at the bar a strange face attracts more conversation these days than hostile stares.</p> <p>And what the conversation loses in logic it more than makes up for in moral certainty.</p> <p>Paedophiles, agree Dave and Mike (not their real names), \"need a slap\" because they have committed \"the mother of all crimes\". But nothing, they say, can condone the rioting on the estate that made the headlines last week. The trouble, they insist, with young people today is that they get away with too much. \"In my day if you got in trouble at school you'd get the cane,\" recalls Dave. \"At home you'd get the slipper and in the street then a policeman would give you a clip round the ear. But you're not allowed to hit kids nowadays and they just run riot.\"</p> <p>In short, there is so much violence because there is not enough violence. Between them, a few pints and a few hours, they come up with a wish list of things needed to put the country right that is long and broad as their tattooed arms. They flit between national service, longer prison sentences, greater parental control and order in Northern Ireland. They are no more contradictory or less cogent than barroom philosophers anywhere else in the country and their arguments are held together with the same strong, thin thread of political reasoning. It is called populism; and increasingly, in the presence of new technologies and the absence of meaningful, mainstream agendas, it is dominating the British political landscape.</p> <p>The latest example is the News of the World campaign to avenge the murder of eight-year-old Sarah Payne by \"naming and shaming\" paedophiles and establishing \"Sarah's Law\". But before then there was the drive to keep Section 28. And in between came Tony Martin, the Have-a-Go Harry who earned brief folkloric status when he murdered a teenage burglar, dump the pump and the standoffs at Drumcree in the north of Ireland.</p> <p>Not all have been successful, since, where populism is concerned, success depends not on the power of the argument or the possible benefits of any particular outcome but on the degree to which those involved manage to locate the right nerve at the right time and in the right way. That is the very art of the populist. To tap a nerve that pits the wrath of the many against the perceived vested interests of a few. Dump the pump failed miserably; Sarah's law has made a definite but ill-defined impact; Section 28 still stands in England.</p> <p>Whatever the outcome they share some common attributes. Each has at its root some visceral, atavistic nugget of \"common sense\" - \"a man has a right to protect his property\", \"life should mean life\" or \"homosexuality is not natural\" - through which any shaded argument, empirical evidence or moral alternative is first refracted to the point of distortion and then eliminated. And in order to have any hope of success each has had to rely on lowest common denominator politics that are necessarily crude and majoritarian.</p> <p>Populism, while not a coherent set of political beliefs is nonetheless a coherent political strategy for cohering disparate forces. It draws its legitimacy from the support in enjoys among the working class. But it rarely draws its leaders from them. The campaign against Section 28 in Scotland was bankrolled by millionaire Brian Souter; in England it was lead by the unelected Lords. If populism's proletarian footsoldiers behave themselves they are idealised as \"ordinary folk\"; if they misbehave, as they did in Paulsgrove, their former allies disown them as an \"uncouth mob\".</p> <p>Therein lies both the strength and the weakness of populism. It stands above party and beyond many, but by no means all, established social and economic constituencies in a bid to galvanise large numbers of people over one issue. Very occasionally its targets might be privileged and effete - high street banks, fox hunters or fat cats - but for the most part they comprise the weakest and the most vulnerable - asylum seekers, drug addicts, single mothers or gays and lesbians - who are less well equipped to defend themselves.</p> <p>These scapegoats are never picked at random or in relation to the threat they may pose at any one time - none of the mothers in Paulsgrove could recall the last time there was a sex offence against a child in the area. They are deliberately identified as the group which would attract the broadest swathe of opposition and the deepest levels of resentment at any one time.</p> <p>So while there is nothing intrinsically reactionary in populism, it rarely lends itself neatly to progressive causes either. Ken Livingstone and Jesse Jackson are two of the most talented populists on the left. But the list on the right, which would include Ian Paisley, Silvio Berlusconi, J\u00f6rg Haider and Vladimir Zhirinovsky, is far longer and more powerful.</p> <p>Wherever they exist, the populist cause has been greatly facilitated by both the internet and special phone lines.

      "bodyText": "The Beehive on the Paulsgrove estate in Portsmouth is friendlier than it looks. Described by one local as \"rough as arseholes\" the landlord prefers to refer to it as a family pub. There are goats, rabbits and birds in the back for children to look at and at the bar a strange face attracts more conversation these days than hostile stares. And what the conversation loses in logic it more than makes up for in moral certainty. Paedophiles, agree Dave and Mike (not their real names), \"need a slap\" because they have committed \"the mother of all crimes\". But nothing, they say, can condone the rioting on the estate that made the headlines last week. The trouble, they insist, with young people today is that they get away with too much. \"In my day if you got in trouble at school you'd get the cane,\" recalls Dave. \"At home you'd get the slipper and in the street then a policeman would give you a clip round the ear. But you're not allowed to hit kids nowadays and they just run riot.\" In short, there is so much violence because there is not enough violence. Between them, a few pints and a few hours, they come up with a wish list of things needed to put the country right that is long and broad as their tattooed arms. They flit between national service, longer prison sentences, greater parental control and order in Northern Ireland. They are no more contradictory or less cogent than barroom philosophers anywhere else in the country and their arguments are held together with the same strong, thin thread of political reasoning. It is called populism; and increasingly, in the presence of new technologies and the absence of meaningful, mainstream agendas, it is dominating the British political landscape. The latest example is the News of the World campaign to avenge the murder of eight-year-old Sarah Payne by \"naming and shaming\" paedophiles and establishing \"Sarah's Law\". But before then there was the drive to keep Section 28. And in between came Tony Martin, the Have-a-Go Harry who earned brief folkloric status when he murdered a teenage burglar, dump the pump and the standoffs at Drumcree in the north of Ireland. Not all have been successful, since, where populism is concerned, success depends not on the power of the argument or the possible benefits of any particular outcome but on the degree to which those involved manage to locate the right nerve at the right time and in the right way. That is the very art of the populist. To tap a nerve that pits the wrath of the many against the perceived vested interests of a few. Dump the pump failed miserably; Sarah's law has made a definite but ill-defined impact; Section 28 still stands in England. Whatever the outcome they share some common attributes. Each has at its root some visceral, atavistic nugget of \"common sense\" - \"a man has a right to protect his property\", \"life should mean life\" or \"homosexuality is not natural\" - through which any shaded argument, empirical evidence or moral alternative is first refracted to the point of distortion and then eliminated. And in order to have any hope of success each has had to rely on lowest common denominator politics that are necessarily crude and majoritarian. Populism, while not a coherent set of political beliefs is nonetheless a coherent political strategy for cohering disparate forces. It draws its legitimacy from the support in enjoys among the working class. But it rarely draws its leaders from them. The campaign against Section 28 in Scotland was bankrolled by millionaire Brian Souter; in England it was lead by the unelected Lords. If populism's proletarian footsoldiers behave themselves they are idealised as \"ordinary folk\"; if they misbehave, as they did in Paulsgrove, their former allies disown them as an \"uncouth mob\". Therein lies both the strength and the weakness of populism. It stands above party and beyond many, but by no means all, established social and economic constituencies in a bid to galvanise large numbers of people over one issue. Very occasionally its targets might be privileged and effete - high street banks, fox hunters or fat cats - but for the most part they comprise the weakest and the most vulnerable - asylum seekers, drug addicts, single mothers or gays and lesbians - who are less well equipped to defend themselves. These scapegoats are never picked at random or in relation to the threat they may pose at any one time - none of the mothers in Paulsgrove could recall the last time there was a sex offence against a child in the area. They are deliberately identified as the group which would attract the broadest swathe of opposition and the deepest levels of resentment at any one time. So while there is nothing intrinsically reactionary in populism, it rarely lends itself neatly to progressive causes either. Ken Livingstone and Jesse Jackson are two of the most talented populists on the left. But the list on the right, which would include Ian Paisley, Silvio Berlusconi, J\u00f6rg Haider and Vladimir Zhirinovsky, is far longer and more powerful. Wherever they exist, the populist cause has been greatly facilitated by both the internet and special phone lines. It is from the web that the list of \"paedophiles\" in Paulsgrove emerged and through it that the ill-fated dump the pump attempted to organise. Which shows that with the right subject it has the unique ability to create, forge and mobilise political communities literally out of thin air. They have also taken to erecting parallel and impromptu pastiches of democracy to endorse their position. Brian Souter financed a \"referendum\" in Scotland; most news-based websites invite you to vote on an issue of the day; tabloids publish telephone referenda as a daily affair on anything from Hague's pints to the nation's paedophiles. At a time when attendance at the polls is plummeting we have become a dial and click democracy. The number of votes cast last week to evict either Caroline or Thomas from Big Brother is only fractionally below the number of votes cast in both Scotland and Wales in last year's European elections. By the end of this week it will almost certainly have overtaken those who voted for London mayor. The reaction of the political class to this new wave of populism has been uneven.

      "bodyText": "Police last night promised to maintain a higher profile at sectarian flashpoints in Northern Ireland after a group of 50 gunmen went on the rampage through a nationalist area of north Belfast early yesterday. The gang ran through the streets off the Limestone Road waving guns in the air to terrorise residents. The Ulster Defence Association and the Ulster Freedom Fighters were blamed for the attacks. Last week the UFF threatened to break its ceasefire in retaliation for attacks on Protestant homes. A woman suffered a minor injury after being assaulted, while paint and bricks were thrown at houses and cars. RUC Superintendent Roger Maxwell said: \"This is the latest in a number of attacks across Belfast on both sides of the community in recent days and is a worrying trend. I want to reassure people that we will be making every effort to bring the culprits to justice,\" he said. \"We will be raising the police profile in the area and working with community contacts to prevent a recurrence.\" John White of the Ulster Democratic party, the UDA's political wing, said the attack appeared to be in response to similar attacks in loyalist areas. But Gerard Brophy, a Sinn Fein councillor, said it was an attempt to provoke a reaction from young nationalists. On Saturday night a house off the Serpentine Road in north Belfast was attacked with a petrol bomb. Police were also seeking a motive for an attempted pipe bomb attack on a house in Ballymoney, Co Antrim. The device - long associated with loyalist terrorists - was defused by army bomb disposal experts. The UFF threatened earlier in the summer to to shoot anyone attacking Protestant homes. The threat was suspended within days but reinstated on Thursday night by the terror group as it staged a show of strength in the loyalist Shankill area of the city. Last night the Loyalist Volunteer Force issued a statement supporting the UFF's position and warning it would take similar action \"if necessary\". \u0095 On Saturday a deal between nationalists and loyalists in Londonderry was hailed a success after a large Protestant parade passed off without serious trouble. More than 10,000 Apprentice Boys and 170 bands took part in the parade. About half a dozen bottles were thrown by a crowd of nationalists watching the main demonstration and insults were exchanged as the demonstration passed the flashpoint Diamond area. But police and parade stewards kept the two sides apart and the event was relatively trouble-free.",

Both are using the power of privilege and big corporate money to compensate for their mediocrity, both stand for precisely the same inconsequential things. </p> <p>If Gore imagined that he could surf to power on the back of the strength of the US economy, he has been rudely awakened. For him, this is crunch time; he needs this week's Democratic convention to put some oomph into his dreary campaign. There is broad agreement that Gore's priority is to beat back Bush's invasion of the middle ground of American politics, where the Republicans have made a beach-head with their appeal to a \"caring conservatism\". </p> <p>It is now the accepted norm that this strategy is the only way to win elections, not just in America but in Britain as well. According to this theory, the death of class as an economic force means that class politics are also dead. The days when politicians like Roosevelt or Truman could appeal to a natural working class constituency are gone. We are all middle class now, and that requires parties to hug the centre ground and pay as much attention to lifestyle as to economics. </p> <p>This is a beguiling notion, particularly for those who have done splendidly well out of the status quo of the past two decades, because it means that nothing ever really changes, or needs to change. Yes, of course, there is a bit of tinkering around at the edge when a Democrat is in the White House, but nothing that would put the wind up Wall Street. As the American economist Robert Pollin said in a recent New Left Review: \"The core of Clinton's programme has been global economic integration, with minimum interventions to promote equity in labour markets or stability in financial markets. Gestures to the least well-off have been slight and back-handed, while wages for the majority have either stagnated or declined. Wealth at the top, meanwhile, has exploded.\" </p> <p>Clinton, according to Pollin, has presided over a country which has experienced greater poverty and lower real wages than under Richard Nixon, which may explain why Gore is having so much trouble enthusing his party. Under Democrats and Republicans, the centre of gravity of politics has moved steadily to the right. </p> <p>But the political strategy only really makes sense if the basic premise - that class no longer matters - is correct. Our own Industrial Society published an example of the new thinking a couple of weeks ago, claiming that Britain was now teeming with free workers. \"Three transformations - the waves of white collar downsizing in the 80s and 90s, the rise in the proportion of value added by skilled workers and the explosion of IT - have combined to create a fertile breeding ground for a new kind of worker. Hearts hardened by the decline of corporate job protection, these workers are demanding, mobile and self-reliant. They are high on human capital and low on loyalty.\" </p> <p>Now, banish from your mind any unworthy thought that the author of this breathless prose has to be a) male, b) white, c) university educated, and d) part of the metropolitan in-crowd. Ask the question: is it really true that the working class no longer exists? </p> <p>For all the talk, America actually remains a country in which the clear majority of people are working class. When asked, 55% of Americans said they were working class, which pretty much tallies with an occupational breakdown of the US jobs market. The US department of labour's projection for the 10 occupations that would offer the most new jobs in the first years of the millennium were cashiers, janitors and cleaners, retail salespersons, waiters and waitresses, registered nurses, general managers and top executives, systems analysts, home health aides, guards, and nurses aides, orderlies, and attendants. Not much sign of the end of the working class there. </p> <p>The picture is much the same in Britain. There has been a modest increase in the number of managers and professionals, but the government's own figures show that Britain is a nation of tradesmen, secretaries, machine operatives and care workers rather than a nation of \"free workers\". </p> <p>Class only ceases to matter in the workplace if it is assumed that class is linked to whether you are employed in a blue collar or white collar job. But in reality class is not about whether you can wear what you like to the office, or whether your boss lets you dress down on Fridays. It is about power. </p> <p>Michael Zweig says in his new book The Working Class Majority*: \"Our society's growing inequality of income and wealth is a reflection of the increased power of capitalists and the reduced power of workers. In the last two decades the working class has experienced lower real incomes, longer hours at work, fewer protections by unions or government regulations, and inferior schools.\" </p> <p>Zweig's argument is that the political power of the economic elite is at least as great as it was in the 1920s, and perhaps even greater since it is no longer effectively challenged by other class interests. His view is that the Third Way does not amount to an effective defence of working class interests. The elite likes Clinton because he poses no real threat. </p> <p>But isn't it the case that the standards of living of working people have increased dramatically in the past 50 or 100 years? Isn't it true that capitalism has delivered not just for the capitalists but for everybody? This is a reasonable point, and it is true that the spread of home and car ownership, the increase in overseas travel and the blanket coverage of many consumer durables mean that the sort of lifestyle that was only available to a small minority in mid-century is now enjoyed by large chunks of the working class. </p> <p>Zweig's first point is that everybody has seen their living standards rise over the past 50 or 100 years, and that there is scant evidence that the working class has caught up with the middle class, let alone the capitalist class. Secondly, working class families have improved their lot when they have been able to take home in higher pay (or shorter working hours) a share of the increased wealth they have created through their higher productivity. As the graph shows, in the post-war period up to 1972, real wages rose in line with productivity. After 1972, productivity and output carried on rising but real wages fell for a quarter of a century until starting to rise again in 1997 as America returned to full employment. Instead of being captured by workers, America's productivity gains were captured by capital. </p> <p>Nor is this picture likely to change much. It is in the interests of the Republicans and the Democrats, reliant as they are on big business funding to give the impression that everybody is now on the same side. So while Clinton has nudged up the level of the minimum wage and raised the earned income tax credit, he has done nothing to change the power dynamics of the American economy. </p> <p>None of this means that Gore is doomed. Given that Bush appears to be a couple of spare ribs short of a barbecue, the Democrats still have a good chance of victory. But apathy will be the real winner. Gore might argue that America's working people simply do not grasp what their leaders are doing. The reality is that America's working class seems to understand only too well. </p> <p> *Michael Zweig: The Working Class Majority; ILR/Cornell University Press.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Orange, which hopes to become the first company to allow people with pre-paid mobile phones to top up their call time at cash machines, could have a scheme in place by January. </p> <p>The scheme could result in lower costs for pre-paid mobile phone users because at present they have to buy top-up vouchers from shops, and an estimated 15%-25% of the value of these goes to the retailer. </p> <p>It is understood that Orange, Britain's third-largest mobile operator, hopes to allow people to load credit on to their mobiles at cash machines within months. Vodafone is also thought to be pursuing the idea. </p> <p>The scheme would involve banks and building societies teaming up with the major mobile phone companies, which would probably issue their customers with plastic cards on to which they could transfer money over from their current account to increase their call time. A customer would insert their debit card into the cash machine, select the pre-paid phone option on the screen, and then insert their plastic card. </p> <p>Pre-paid phones are the fastest-growing sector of the mobile phone market, and now account for around 60% of all mobile phones in use. These packages are popular because they allow people to buy phone handsets without paying monthly bills. </p> <p>At present, in order to obtain call time a customer usually buys a voucher from a shop, rings the phone company's credit line and enters the number on the voucher. This tops up the phone with the amount of credit purchased. </p> <p>Potentially giving people access to up to 27,000 cash machines would enable the phone companies to dramatically reduce the amount that retailers earn from selling the vouchers. The bank or building society owning the cash machine would presumably earn a commission but it is unlikely to be nearly as large as that taken by shops. </p> <p>Orange said that it was still in contractual negotiations about the scheme. A spokesman said: \"Nothing has been signed.\" </p> <p>Vodafone has already said of the cash machine plan that \"it is certainly something we are working toward\".</p>",

      "bodyText": "Orange, which hopes to become the first company to allow people with pre-paid mobile phones to top up their call time at cash machines, could have a scheme in place by January. The scheme could result in lower costs for pre-paid mobile phone users because at present they have to buy top-up vouchers from shops, and an estimated 15%-25% of the value of these goes to the retailer. It is understood that Orange, Britain's third-largest mobile operator, hopes to allow people to load credit on to their mobiles at cash machines within months. Vodafone is also thought to be pursuing the idea. The scheme would involve banks and building societies teaming up with the major mobile phone companies, which would probably issue their customers with plastic cards on to which they could transfer money over from their current account to increase their call time. A customer would insert their debit card into the cash machine, select the pre-paid phone option on the screen, and then insert their plastic card. Pre-paid phones are the fastest-growing sector of the mobile phone market, and now account for around 60% of all mobile phones in use. These packages are popular because they allow people to buy phone handsets without paying monthly bills. At present, in order to obtain call time a customer usually buys a voucher from a shop, rings the phone company's credit line and enters the number on the voucher. This tops up the phone with the amount of credit purchased. Potentially giving people access to up to 27,000 cash machines would enable the phone companies to dramatically reduce the amount that retailers earn from selling the vouchers. The bank or building society owning the cash machine would presumably earn a commission but it is unlikely to be nearly as large as that taken by shops. Orange said that it was still in contractual negotiations about the scheme. A spokesman said: \"Nothing has been signed.\" Vodafone has already said of the cash machine plan that \"it is certainly something we are working toward\".",

In 1966, she sued NBC for $2.5m when they used the introductions to her old TV shows, because the 1950s fashions dated her; she sued them again in 1972, and won $600,000 for their unlawful exhibition of her TV shows abroad. In 1969, she sued 20th Century-Fox for $54,000 because the movie Myra Breckinridge contained clips from her films, used without her permission.

      "body": "<p>Large scale football violence is becoming increasingly common with hooligans using the internet and mobile phones to arrange confrontations.</p> <p>Figures released by the national criminal intelligence service, show that violence is again marring the domestic game, much of it taking place away from grounds or after matches have finished.</p> <p>The figures will embarrass government and football officals who have insisted that hooliganism usually takes place abroad when the national team is playing.</p> <p>While the overall number of arrests for hooliganism fell slightly to 3,137 last season, from 3,341 in the season 1998-1999, attacks were more violent and better organised, often involving weapons.</p> <p>Last season, there were 83 particularly violent incidents. In one of the most serious confrontations Stoke City and Cardiff City supporters battled throughout the day and into the night when the two teams met in a second division match. Other organised confrontations involved supporters of Wolverhampton Wanderers, Chelsea, Sunderland and Manchester City.</p> <p>There were a number of mass arrests with dozens of hooligans being rounded up to prevent trouble. In one incident, 168 Chelsea fans were arrested as they planned to attack Tottenham Hotspur fans.</p> <p>The number of arrests for racist chanting also increased with 34 people arrested compared to 25 during the 1998-99 season. Missile throwing also made an unwelcome return with 88 fans arrested for the offence last season compared to 42 the season before.</p> <p>Sunderland top the arrest league with 223 arrests last season followed by Chelsea, with 168 arrests. Macclesfield and Wycombe Wanderers had no arrests at their grounds while Manchester United had 88 arrests from a total crowd of 1.04m who attended their matches last season.</p> <p>There were 1,461 arrests in the Premiership, 831 in division one, 586 in division two and 259 in division three.</p> <p>With CCTV cameras installed at all league grounds and many matches heavily policed, the criminal intelligence service said most violence now takes place away from stadiums, particularly in town centres or as fans are travelling to or away from matches.</p> <p>The stereotype of the hooligan is changing, with many from middle class backgrounds working in the professions. The organisers are also involved in other criminal activity such as drug dealing and theft and are using technology to arrange confrontations. Bryan Drew, head of strategic and specialist intelligence at NCIS said: \"Football hooliganism is more sophisticated than it was.</p> <p>\"Invariably, the incidents are away from grounds and are therefore more difficult to police.

      "bodyText": "Large scale football violence is becoming increasingly common with hooligans using the internet and mobile phones to arrange confrontations. Figures released by the national criminal intelligence service, show that violence is again marring the domestic game, much of it taking place away from grounds or after matches have finished. The figures will embarrass government and football officals who have insisted that hooliganism usually takes place abroad when the national team is playing. While the overall number of arrests for hooliganism fell slightly to 3,137 last season, from 3,341 in the season 1998-1999, attacks were more violent and better organised, often involving weapons. Last season, there were 83 particularly violent incidents. In one of the most serious confrontations Stoke City and Cardiff City supporters battled throughout the day and into the night when the two teams met in a second division match. Other organised confrontations involved supporters of Wolverhampton Wanderers, Chelsea, Sunderland and Manchester City. There were a number of mass arrests with dozens of hooligans being rounded up to prevent trouble. In one incident, 168 Chelsea fans were arrested as they planned to attack Tottenham Hotspur fans. The number of arrests for racist chanting also increased with 34 people arrested compared to 25 during the 1998-99 season. Missile throwing also made an unwelcome return with 88 fans arrested for the offence last season compared to 42 the season before. Sunderland top the arrest league with 223 arrests last season followed by Chelsea, with 168 arrests. Macclesfield and Wycombe Wanderers had no arrests at their grounds while Manchester United had 88 arrests from a total crowd of 1.04m who attended their matches last season. There were 1,461 arrests in the Premiership, 831 in division one, 586 in division two and 259 in division three. With CCTV cameras installed at all league grounds and many matches heavily policed, the criminal intelligence service said most violence now takes place away from stadiums, particularly in town centres or as fans are travelling to or away from matches. The stereotype of the hooligan is changing, with many from middle class backgrounds working in the professions. The organisers are also involved in other criminal activity such as drug dealing and theft and are using technology to arrange confrontations. Bryan Drew, head of strategic and specialist intelligence at NCIS said: \"Football hooliganism is more sophisticated than it was. \"Invariably, the incidents are away from grounds and are therefore more difficult to police. The criminal hooligan element often know when a game is going to be 'police free' and far from being mindless they are often organised and adept at exploiting spontaneous situations.\" With the English football season starting last Saturday and the Premiership begining this weekend, police and football officals are hoping that the Football Spectators Act which comes into force next month will curb hooliganism. The law will prevent known hooligans from attending matches, either in Britain or abroad, and police will have the power to detain those they suspect of planning violence. The Home Office minister Lord Bassam said on Radio 4's The World this Weekend: \"Ten years ago we had something like 10,000 arrests (for football hooliganism) annually. Now that is down to around 3,000. We should not be complacent. There was a big problem at Euro 2000 and we have taken measures to stop it. \"The overall total number of arrests maybe down but the hooligans are still with us and there is clearly a hard core of thugs trying to have weekly pre-organised fights some way from the stadium.\" A spokesman for the Football Association said: \"They are not football supporters, they are criminals.\" Trouble spots for fans Cardiff City v Millwall, August 9, 1999, Nationwide League Div 2 and return fixture December 12 At Cardiff, a six-year-old girl received head injuries after being hit by a missile after clashes between 500 home fans and Millwall supporters. The return fixture saw trouble all day. At the game's end 90 seats were ripped up and thrown on to the pitch by Cardiff fans. Arsenal v Manchester United, August 22, Premiership At Holloway Road underground station 10 Arsenal supporters looking for opposing fans attacked a man on a train leaving him unconscious. England v Argentina, February 22, international Ten Derby fans attacked drinkers in a pub popular with Spurs fans. The Derby fans were chased out and received serious injuries. One nearly had an arm severed. Birmingham City v Wolverhampton Wanderers, April 1, Nationwide League Div 1 A petrol bomb was thrown as 100 fans clashed with bottles, pool cues and bricks, leaving two men seriously injured. Bristol Rovers v Stoke City, April 1, Nationwide League Div 2 The Stoke goalkeeper was attacked in quick succession by two Bristol fans. Leicester City v Everton, April 8, Premiership After this fixture a group of Muslims who were distributing leaflets in the city centre were attacked. One sustained a broken jaw. Their attackers were identified as Leicester City supporters. Stoke City v Cardiff City, April 4, Nationwide League Div 2 A group of around 300 Cardiff supporters under police escort to the stadium were repeatedly ambushed by a group of around 600-800 Stoke supporters. Searches of fans yielded a circular saw and 100 Stanley knives. Rotherham v Swansea, May 6, Nationwide League Div 3 This was a high profile fixture with the championship to be decided. During disturbances a Swansea supporter sustained fatal injuries. \u0095 Source: NCIS Arrests over one or two decks 1999/2000 arrests while travelling or at matches Premiership Sunderland 223 Chelsea 168 Leeds United 116 Tottenham Hotspur 96 Bradford City 93 Arsenal 89 Manchester United 88 Everton 80 Liverpool 80 Sheffield Wed 78 Newcastle United 68 West Ham United 62 Leicester City 41 Middlesbrough 37 Aston Villa 34 Coventry City 32 Derby County 32 Wimbledon 22 Watford 21 Southampton 15 Division One Manchester City 165 Birmingham City 77 Barnsley 60 W'hampton Wan 47 Queens Pk Rangers 40 Nottingham Forest 39 West Bromich Albion 36 Huddersfield Town 35 Portsmouth 29 Sheffield United 28 Grimsby Town 27 Bolton Wanderers 26 Ipswich Town 23 Blackburn Rovers 22 Fulham 22 Swindon Town 19 Charlton Athletic 18 Crystal Palace 17 Norwich City 15 Port Vale 14 Stockport County 12 Tranmere Rovers 12 Crewe Alexandra 6 Division Two Millwall 102 Cardiff City 83 Stoke City 56 Burnley 48 Wigan Athletic 48 Bristol City 44 Bristol Rovers 31 Luton Town 26 Preston North End 21 Reading 21 Wrexham 10 Blackpool 9 Notts County 9 Bournemouth 8 Scunthorpe United 8 Brentford 6 Cambridge United 6 Oldham Athletic 6 Bury 5 Colchester United 5 Chesterfield 4 Gillingham 3 Wycombe Wanderers 0 Division Three Swansea City 30 Brighton and Hove Albion 25 Rotherham United 23 Hartlepool United 22 Plymouth Argyle 21 Darlington 17 Hull City 16 Northampton Town 16 Exeter City 13 Peterborough United 13 Carlisle United 11 Lincoln City 9 Rochdale 7 Halifax Town 6 Leyton Orient 6 Mansfield Town 5 Cheltenham Town 4 Shrewsbury Town 4 Southend United 4 Barnet 3 Chester City 2 York City 2 Torquay United 1 Macclesfield Town 0 \u0095 Source: National Criminal Intelligence Service",

While the Democrats assemble downtown for the razzmatazz coronation of Al Gore and the Reform party disperses in chaos in Long Beach, the North American Anarchist Conference has been meeting quietly at the weekend in a crowded studio just north of Dodger Stadium, the home of one of Los Angeles's baseball teams. For the coming week Los Angeles will be the focal point of US protest, and the American anarchists have a tradition of involvement in such battles, stretching back to the beginning of the last century. This has made them suspicious of the police and the media, and many of those on the door at the studio building have obscured their faces with Zapatista-style bandanas and wear badges naming them as Idiot, Corpse, Sativa or Stream.

      "bodyText": "Observer Arriva, the buses and car dealership group, is being stalked by a private equity group and could be the subject of a takeover bid. Both Arriva and Go-Ahead could be taken over this year, according to analysts. Abbey National and Alliance &amp; Leicester are expected to face increasing pressure from shareholders to put themselves up for sale following Barclays' takeover of Woolwich, according to the Observer. The newspaper did not name its source, but said Abbey is rumoured to have held talks with a number of potential suitors, including Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland, but chief executive Ian Harley appears to be determined to retain his independence. Sunday Business ONdigital, the digital terrestial broadcaster owned by ITV companies Carlton and Granada, is to float on the stock market within six months with a price tag of about \u00a32bn. Isabel Maxwell, eldest daughter of disgraced tycoon Robert Maxwell, is to enter the British business world by joining the board of internet start up Espotting.com. Online auctioneer QXL is pondering a substantial cut in its offer for the German online auction house Ricardo.de. The all-share bid was originally worth \u00a3670m, but it is now valued at \u00a3230m and is expected to be marked down further. Sunday Times Sir Martin Laing, chairman of Nursing Home Properties, Britain's biggest nursing home group, is to hold a crisis meeting with chief executive, Richard Ellert, this week after the collapse in the share price. Fund managers want more aggressive performance-related pay for company directors, bringing Britain into line with the US where the most successful executives can have salary packages worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Royal &amp; Sun Alliance is planning a New York stock exchange flotation this autumn. Sources say the company is believed to be in discussions with US regulators about the details and timing of the listing, due at the end of October. Sunday Telegraph Telesens, the German software services group, is poised to acquire KSCL, the Scottish software company owned by Kingston Communications, the Hull telecoms group, 3i and Royal Bank Development Capital, for up to \u00a3300m. Singer &amp; Friedlander has made a takeover approach to BWD Securities in an effort to transform itself into a pure investment management group. Bankers believe Singer &amp; Friedlander is likely to have to pay at least \u00a3160m to buy the business. Merrill Lynch is thought also to be in talks to buy the business for up to \u00a3300m. GKN, the engineering and aerospace group, has put Westland Heliport up for sale offering the buyer a chance to own central London's only helicopter landing site ITM Activate, the media company which has the rights to operate the National Union of Students' internet business, is to float for up to \u00a31bn next spring in a move which should provide the student organisation with a welcome windfall worth up to \u00a350m. Abbey National is working on plans to hand over the running of its credit card, general insurance and mortgage processing operations in an attempt to cut costs by more than \u00a3150m a year. Mail on Sunday Only two of the scores of creditors of Boo.com, crashed internet retailer, will receive any of the \u00a330m they are owed by the company. NatWest Bank's Lombard Finance and GE Capital had claims over computers used and are likely to get some money back. Boo's 250 former employees get \u00a3800 each. Sunday Express Actress Melanie Griffith has told friends that she expects to make $100m from an internet business she co-founded. However executives were unable to explain how she arrived at her lofty projections. IoS Partners in Andersen Consulting could receive shares worth $10m (\u00a36.7m) each if the firm decides to float after winning its freedom from sister company Arthur Andersen. Sir Stanley Kalms In a report on Saturday, we said that Sir Stanley Kalms had seen his annual pay increase by \u00a340,000.

      "body": "<p>So far so good. Japan abandoned its zero interest rate policy on Friday and raised the cost of borrowing for the first time in 10 years. The markets took the announcement in their stride. </p> <p>The move came too late in the day to have much impact in the far east, but in Europe and the US it prompted little reaction. By the end of trading in London, the yen, which some thought would strengthen, was unchanged at 108.7 to the dollar. </p> <p>Masaru Hayami, the Bank of Japan's governor, will no doubt have felt vindicated. Yet, the longer they think about it, the more the markets might begin to doubt the wisdom of his action. </p> <p>Despite a mild recovery of company profitability and a pick up in investment spending, largely due to the buoyancy of global demand, the domestic economy remains weak and consumer prices are still falling. Few independent analysts share Mr Hayami's belief \"that the economy has reached the stage where deflationary concern has been dispelled\". </p> <p>At the same time that the economy's cyclical position is in doubt, a programme of structural reform is under way which, while ultimately beneficial, could depress demand in the short term. The collapse last month of the Sogo department store group, Japan's largest non- financial bankruptcy, shows that banks and corporations are at last beginning to wake up to to the reality of rising loan-losses and bad assets. </p> <p>Instead of focusing on providing lifetime employment, firms are putting profitability first. In the long run, this should ensure their survival, but the dole queue is likely to lengthen and nervous consumers could become even more wary of spending. </p> <p>Mr Hayami's determination to increase interest rates - he has been agitating to do so since April - was intended to spur the reform process by taking away the crutch of free money. But the danger is that the economy will fall over. In a report published on Friday, the IMF said that reform was best carried out against a backdrop of a recovery and that today's upswing remained \"fragile and subject to downside risk\". </p> <p>The early removal of a stimulatory monetary policy could send the economy back into recession, it warned. </p> <p>In 1997, the Japanese government tightened fiscal policy prematurely. It subsequently spent far more in stimulatory fiscal packages than the savings it originally planned to make. </p> <p>The markets will be watching the Japanese economic data due out over the next few weeks with a keener interest than usual in order to judge whether Mr Hayami has made a similar mistake over monetary policy.</p>",

      "bodyText": "So far so good. Japan abandoned its zero interest rate policy on Friday and raised the cost of borrowing for the first time in 10 years. The markets took the announcement in their stride. The move came too late in the day to have much impact in the far east, but in Europe and the US it prompted little reaction. By the end of trading in London, the yen, which some thought would strengthen, was unchanged at 108.7 to the dollar. Masaru Hayami, the Bank of Japan's governor, will no doubt have felt vindicated. Yet, the longer they think about it, the more the markets might begin to doubt the wisdom of his action. Despite a mild recovery of company profitability and a pick up in investment spending, largely due to the buoyancy of global demand, the domestic economy remains weak and consumer prices are still falling. Few independent analysts share Mr Hayami's belief \"that the economy has reached the stage where deflationary concern has been dispelled\". At the same time that the economy's cyclical position is in doubt, a programme of structural reform is under way which, while ultimately beneficial, could depress demand in the short term. The collapse last month of the Sogo department store group, Japan's largest non- financial bankruptcy, shows that banks and corporations are at last beginning to wake up to to the reality of rising loan-losses and bad assets. Instead of focusing on providing lifetime employment, firms are putting profitability first. In the long run, this should ensure their survival, but the dole queue is likely to lengthen and nervous consumers could become even more wary of spending. Mr Hayami's determination to increase interest rates - he has been agitating to do so since April - was intended to spur the reform process by taking away the crutch of free money. But the danger is that the economy will fall over. In a report published on Friday, the IMF said that reform was best carried out against a backdrop of a recovery and that today's upswing remained \"fragile and subject to downside risk\". The early removal of a stimulatory monetary policy could send the economy back into recession, it warned. In 1997, the Japanese government tightened fiscal policy prematurely. It subsequently spent far more in stimulatory fiscal packages than the savings it originally planned to make. The markets will be watching the Japanese economic data due out over the next few weeks with a keener interest than usual in order to judge whether Mr Hayami has made a similar mistake over monetary policy.",

In 1979, the top rate of income tax was 83% and the basic rate 33%; VAT was levied at 8%. Geoffrey Howe's first budget in June 1979 cut the top rate to 60% and the basic rate to 30%, while pushing VAT up to 15%. The next big move was made by Nigel Lawson in 1988, when he reduced the top rate to 40% (where it remains) and dragged the basic rate down to 25%. VAT was raised to 17.5% by Norman Lamont in 1991 to pay for the abolition of the poll tax. And the basic rate is now 22% courtesy of Gordon Brown.</p> <p>All this has made the tax system less progressive because the rich, especially the top 1% of the population, have been the main beneficiaries of cuts in direct taxation. The poor spend a higher proportion of their incomes on goods that incur VAT and excise duties.

Tax increases that raise the price of cigarettes by 10% worldwide would increase revenues by about 7% on average. \"The evidence indicates that young people are more responsive to price changes than adults.

The time for joy or disconsolation will be tomorrow, when the Guardian will give the results of its latest ICM poll.</p> <p>Our guess is that the figures may give rather more pleasure to Labour than to the Conservatives. This comes from the sense that Labour in the past two or three weeks has wrested back control of the agenda. Before that, William Hague had been making the running and Labour was running scared. But then came Gordon Brown's announcement of a hefty, and overdue, boost for public spending. That thumped a message across which most people were eager to hear. We know, it said, that the services you depend on are nowhere near good enough and we plan to deploy all the resources we can to give you the deal you deserve. It is only a promise, of course, and promises have been broken before, and saying you mean to do something is a long way from delivering. But here at least was a message of hope: and engendering hope is good for political parties.</p> <p>A further aspect of Gallup needs noting in the light of Labour's midsummer panic. The persistent theme of all those lugubrious memos - Philip Gould several times to Tony Blair, Tony Blair to his close associates - was that Labour had drifted out of touch with the electorate. Gallup seems to endorse that: 65% of respondents agreed with the Blair/Gould judgment that Tony Blair and his government were \"somehow out of touch with gut British interests\"; 32% disagreed. In a further show of solidarity with Labour's memo-producers, 55% per cent did not trust the government, against 41% who did.</p> <p>These are worrying figures for a government not so far away from a general election. And yet they are only part of the picture. What Gallup suggested last week was that, while 65% faulted the government for failing to tap the national gut, a commanding 47% still none the less thought they would vote Labour in a general election tomorrow, against 32% (hardly better than at their nadir in 1997) who would back the Conservatives. And Labour had a 10-point lead over the Tories as the party best equipped to steer the nation through economic trouble; and a mighty 87% (including 79% of intending Conservative voters) backed the boost for government spending. Crucially, too, though this poll was taken too early to reflect any possible lift for Mr Hague from the news of his drinking feats in Rotherham in his youth, almost half the electorate rated Tony Blair as the leader best equipped to run the country, against just 22% (10 points below the figure of those who said they would vote Conservative) who think Mr Hague is the man for the job.</p> <p>In other words: the government is not perfect; there is much that it needs to work on; but the nation sees it, quite rightly, as streets ahead of the only real alternative. On this evidence - we shall need to watch whether subsequent figures confirm the pattern - the kind of nervy improvisations which followed Philip Gould's warnings a couple of months ago may be at least as great a threat to its reputation as any of the omens that so much trouble its leader.</p>",

We know, it said, that the services you depend on are nowhere near good enough and we plan to deploy all the resources we can to give you the deal you deserve. It is only a promise, of course, and promises have been broken before, and saying you mean to do something is a long way from delivering. But here at least was a message of hope: and engendering hope is good for political parties. A further aspect of Gallup needs noting in the light of Labour's midsummer panic. The persistent theme of all those lugubrious memos - Philip Gould several times to Tony Blair, Tony Blair to his close associates - was that Labour had drifted out of touch with the electorate. Gallup seems to endorse that: 65% of respondents agreed with the Blair/Gould judgment that Tony Blair and his government were \"somehow out of touch with gut British interests\"; 32% disagreed. In a further show of solidarity with Labour's memo-producers, 55% per cent did not trust the government, against 41% who did. These are worrying figures for a government not so far away from a general election. And yet they are only part of the picture. What Gallup suggested last week was that, while 65% faulted the government for failing to tap the national gut, a commanding 47% still none the less thought they would vote Labour in a general election tomorrow, against 32% (hardly better than at their nadir in 1997) who would back the Conservatives. And Labour had a 10-point lead over the Tories as the party best equipped to steer the nation through economic trouble; and a mighty 87% (including 79% of intending Conservative voters) backed the boost for government spending. Crucially, too, though this poll was taken too early to reflect any possible lift for Mr Hague from the news of his drinking feats in Rotherham in his youth, almost half the electorate rated Tony Blair as the leader best equipped to run the country, against just 22% (10 points below the figure of those who said they would vote Conservative) who think Mr Hague is the man for the job. In other words: the government is not perfect; there is much that it needs to work on; but the nation sees it, quite rightly, as streets ahead of the only real alternative. On this evidence - we shall need to watch whether subsequent figures confirm the pattern - the kind of nervy improvisations which followed Philip Gould's warnings a couple of months ago may be at least as great a threat to its reputation as any of the omens that so much trouble its leader.",

      "bodyText": "Tensions were rising in the northern Kosovo town of Mitrovice yesterday amid signs of an imminent security operation described by UN officials as an attempt to \"regain control\" of the region. A company of the 2nd Battalion, Royal Fusiliers, was reported to have been drafted in from its base in Pristina. Ten people were arrested in the Serb-dominated part of Mitrovice on Saturday night and a cache of grenades, ammunition and radios was seized by French K-For troops. At the same time, a Serb radio station, Radio S, was ordered to close after UN officials said it had failed to apply for a broadcasting licence. Reports in the local press have been predicting a raid on the lucrative Zvecan smelting works, which is part of the Trepca mining complex and has been blamed by the UN for high pollution levels in the town. The factory, which ethnic Albanians long to control, is currently run by Serb authorities and employs at least 4,000 people. UN sources have confirmed that more troops are being brought into Mitrovice to seize control of the factory; the commander of British troops in Pristina was seen talking to UN officials in the town yesterday. Danish soldiers positioned to the north of the town are also expected to be redeployed to Mitrovice. Officials say that the operation will be part of a broader attempt to establish the UN's control of the region; municipal authorities are expected to be targeted, with members of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's ruling Serbian Socialist party, who have been accused of trying to wrest control of the town, arrested and expelled. Mitrovice has been an embarrassment to the UN's mission in Kosovo since its peacekeeping troops took control of it in June 1999. Serb men, known as \"bridge watchers\", equipped with Motorola radios appear to control much of Mitrovice, stopping cars and checking people's identities. The self-appointed leader of the Serb community in Mitrovice, Oliver Ivanovic, has predicted an angry reaction to plans to take over the smelter. Mr Ivanovic said he was planning to hold demonstrations today if the factory is taken over. \"We have to deal with people's fear for their jobs. They are afraid for their future. They are afraid that K-For and [the UN administration] Unmik will bring in Albanians to the north [of the segregated town].\"",

Yet compared to other industries, such as car manufacture or telecommunications, the clothing industry is backward, and fashion designers deeply conservative. Apart from the odd technical fibre here and utility pants there, clothes are made in much the way they were 2,000 years ago: spin fibre into thread, weave thread into cloth, cut into pieces, then sew back together again. This is about to change.</p> <p>Few fashion designers will be prepared for the first collection from three visionary partners when it goes on sale later this month. Levi's ICD+ is an unprecedented collaboration between Philips, Europe's largest electronics company, Levi's, one of the world's largest clothing manufacturers, and designer Massimo Osti, who was last year voted most influential designer of the 90s by menswear magazine Arena Homme Plus. Between them, the trio hope to produce the first really credible, successful range of technical clothing. The first ICD+ range incorporates Philips mobile phone and MP3 technology into a range of jackets designed by Osti and made by Levi's.</p> <p>But the project goes much further than jeans with mobile phone pockets. Superficial \"utility-look\" clothing is over: this is a serious attempt to merge fashion and electronics. \"Levi's heritage is based on the tradition of workwear, but our first miner's pants were launched in 1873 - we needed to examine what people need from workwear today. We identified a group we call nomads who are constantly on the move, always in taxis or airports and need to be wired, so we began looking for partners,\" says Peter Ingwersen, of Levi's.</p> <p>Philips has been working away quietly for years on a project called Philips Wearable Electronics, and this collaboration with Levi's is the first to bear fruit. The project mission statement is \"Philips technology in every shirt and skirt\" and the result will be widely available following this autumn's launch.</p> <p>The electronics group envisions a future in which all garments will contain micro-computers. \"This first collection is the equivalent of laying the first brick in The Great Wall of China. Our goal is to give the objects around us intelligence, so they become our subjects, and this includes our clothes,\" says Stefano Marsano, managing director of Philips Design.</p> <p>Philips is not alone in developing wearable electronics, but it is leading the field. Watch manufacturers including Swatch, Casio and Citizen have announced that they are developing wrist phones, pagers, ski passes and translators. The textile groups Courtaulds and Dupont are working on conductive fibres but so far, the only fashion brand to commit to commercial production of wearable electronics is Levi's.</p> <p>The possibilities are mindboggling. This autumn's jackets feature phones which can be dialled using voice recognition technology, and a microphone and earphones built into the hood or collar. The MP3 player automatically cuts out when the phone rings, and the whole lot is machine washable. Everything is controlled via a keypad hidden beneath a pocket flap. The most challenging aspect of the project, according to Osti, has been to soften and humanise the technology. \"The challenge is not miniaturisation as we currently think of it - making something smaller - but to make it flat and flexible so it becomes a second skin, completely invisible. We aim to massage the technology into the garment,\" say Osti.</p> <p>His name is not widely known, even in fashion circles, because he doesn't use his name on the label, doesn't stage fashion shows and says he isn't interested in being liked by the fashion crowd. But starting in 1975 with the labels Stone Island and CP Company, and later with Left Hand, Massimo Osti Production, and the more recent Equipment for Legs project for Dockers, Osti has consistently put functionality into fashion.</p> <p>At his studio in Bologna, in Italy, he has a collection of more than 25,000 garments, mainly military uniforms, which provide inspiration. Now he wants to use his 25 years of research into fabric and function to bring the latest technology to the masses. \"We want to make ICD+ as ubiquitous as the mobile phone,\" he says. This is just the beginning. In the future, we may see global positioning systems, just like the ones in cars, incorporated into clothes. So when you fly to a new city you'll be able to give the cab driver directions to your destination, using a built-in translator.</p> <p>More outlandish ideas include a face-recognition camera in the hood which discreetly tells you a person's name and vital information when you meet them again. Parents could keep an eye on children through miniature cameras. And all this technology will be invisible, submerged in the fabric. However, one of the reasons for wearing clothes is to look good and a triumph of function over fashion simply won't sell. But, says Osti: \"These clothes contain a lot of technology but don't appear too sci-fi. As always with my designs, form follows function and this is the next step in functionalism. It's important they look beautiful and I struggled to achieve the right level of fashionability because these garments are built to last.\"</p>",

The electronics group envisions a future in which all garments will contain micro-computers. \"This first collection is the equivalent of laying the first brick in The Great Wall of China. Our goal is to give the objects around us intelligence, so they become our subjects, and this includes our clothes,\" says Stefano Marsano, managing director of Philips Design. Philips is not alone in developing wearable electronics, but it is leading the field. Watch manufacturers including Swatch, Casio and Citizen have announced that they are developing wrist phones, pagers, ski passes and translators. The textile groups Courtaulds and Dupont are working on conductive fibres but so far, the only fashion brand to commit to commercial production of wearable electronics is Levi's. The possibilities are mindboggling. This autumn's jackets feature phones which can be dialled using voice recognition technology, and a microphone and earphones built into the hood or collar. The MP3 player automatically cuts out when the phone rings, and the whole lot is machine washable. Everything is controlled via a keypad hidden beneath a pocket flap. The most challenging aspect of the project, according to Osti, has been to soften and humanise the technology. \"The challenge is not miniaturisation as we currently think of it - making something smaller - but to make it flat and flexible so it becomes a second skin, completely invisible. We aim to massage the technology into the garment,\" say Osti. His name is not widely known, even in fashion circles, because he doesn't use his name on the label, doesn't stage fashion shows and says he isn't interested in being liked by the fashion crowd. But starting in 1975 with the labels Stone Island and CP Company, and later with Left Hand, Massimo Osti Production, and the more recent Equipment for Legs project for Dockers, Osti has consistently put functionality into fashion. At his studio in Bologna, in Italy, he has a collection of more than 25,000 garments, mainly military uniforms, which provide inspiration. Now he wants to use his 25 years of research into fabric and function to bring the latest technology to the masses. \"We want to make ICD+ as ubiquitous as the mobile phone,\" he says. This is just the beginning. In the future, we may see global positioning systems, just like the ones in cars, incorporated into clothes. So when you fly to a new city you'll be able to give the cab driver directions to your destination, using a built-in translator. More outlandish ideas include a face-recognition camera in the hood which discreetly tells you a person's name and vital information when you meet them again. Parents could keep an eye on children through miniature cameras. And all this technology will be invisible, submerged in the fabric. However, one of the reasons for wearing clothes is to look good and a triumph of function over fashion simply won't sell. But, says Osti: \"These clothes contain a lot of technology but don't appear too sci-fi. As always with my designs, form follows function and this is the next step in functionalism. It's important they look beautiful and I struggled to achieve the right level of fashionability because these garments are built to last.\"",

Her choice of architect, the 69-year-old Mexican Ricardo Legorreta, seems exactly right. His love of vibrant colour is a perfect match for Rhodes's. Legorreta has designed a wide range of buildings inspired by Mexican tradition. He likes \"the supremacy of solid over voids, the use of colour to enclose wall space\".

Take the early-14th century. Now, imagine yourself in Salisbury watching the last stones of the 404ft spire being winched into place. Down below are gathered some grandees. Look at the womenfolk. Some are wearing steeple hats, as vertiginously Gothic as the spire of the ambitious cathedral, while their long, brilliantly embroidered gowns are as rich and as decorative as the frescoed walls inside the long, tall nave of the magnificent church. Here, for a special moment, couture and cathedral, fashion and architecture are in near- perfect harmony. The lofty ideals of knightly chivalry, too, are somehow wrapped up in this meeting of Gothic cloth and stone. The pointed Early English architecture of the sky- piercing cathedral also recalls the suits of armour that were perfected, aesthetically, at this time: a fully armoured knight resembled a kind of kinetic Gothic building. </p> <p>Leap now, across a void of 300 years, across the full-blown Gothic of the 15th century, across the great houses of the 16th and 17th centuries, across the Baroque dome of Wren's St Paul's and land discreetly in front of a new Palladian house, say, Chiswick, by Lord Burlington, or Mereworth by Colen Campbell. Palladian architecture, all the vogue in Britain and Ireland between 1715 and 1740, was a mathematically correct, chaste and polite form of design that went scented-hand-in-silk-glove with the rise of the much celebrated \"English\" gentleman.

As rich as a box of the most improbable Italian chocolates, Rococo was a style too far for the relatively sedate British, who were often appalled by the sheer, unmitigated extravaganza (or vulgarity) of the land that had given them, via Andrea Palladio in the Veneto and Inigo Jones at home, the very Palladian strictures and structures that they had made so much their own. </p> <p>It was, perhaps, from the beginnings of Romanticism towards the end of the 18th century that architecture and fashion became self-consciously related. As the passion for all things Gothic grew, wealthy architects started to look the part, dressing up first as monks and, later, the most intense Goths began to dress in more or less authentic garb. This, though, was less a coincidence or tailored match between architec ture and fashion, than a form of wilful eccentricity, or perversity. Even so, as Gothic Revival twisted its way into the Aesthetic movement and art nouveau it sometimes became difficult to tell the new Wildean residents of, say, deeply fashionable Chelsea, from their furniture and fittings. </p> <p>The Modern movement, an iconoclastic response to the perceived architectural excesses of the 19th century, saw the re-emergence of severe, almost classical dress among its protagonists and clients. Look at Le Corbusier or Mies van der Rohe as they walked together through the radical white housing complex they designed, in Stuttgart in 1927; in their sombre coats, bankers' hats, brollies and polished shoes they look every bit the \"English\" gentleman. As their houses were a kind of one-step back, two-steps forwards take on the classical tradition (Le Corbusier's famous Villa Savoye, Poissy, 1929-31 was identified by the critic Colin Rowe writing in the Architectural Review in the early 50s as a take on a Palladian villa), so they adopted the sombre garb of a sober gent. </p> <p>Of course all this may simply be a case of architecture as self-portraiture. The peerless architectural cartoonist Louis Hellman quotes, in his book Archi-tetes, Samuel Butler's The Way of all Flesh: \"Every man's work, whether it be literature or music or architecture or anything else, is always a portrait of himself\". The \"id in the grid\", as Hellman shows in his cartoons, is there for anyone with a sharp, and perhaps a little inventive, eye to see.

The actual performance of the songs, therefore, leaves much to the musicians' imagination. \"I think this helps to keep the songs alive,\" reasons McCue, \"even when a song from an oral tradition, once committed to paper, can no longer be said to belong to an oral tradition at all.\" \"We want the concerts to have a 'busky' feel,\" adds Wellington. \"It shouldn't be too staid. We have chosen to work with the cream of the classical and traditional Scots singers and instrumentalists and we asked them to interpret the songs how they will. We intend to get up and fair enjoy ourselves.\" The series Work, Sex and Drink: Scots and Their Songs is in rep at the Hub (0131-473 2000) from August 15 to September 1.",

He was strong, silent and sexy. But not for long. His personal obsessions with boxing, drinking and the IRA led to critically derided fare like Homeboy (1988, boxing), Barfly (1987, drinking) and A Prayer For The Dying (1987, the IRA). He hit a low point with 1991's Harley Davidson And The Marlboro Man, co-starring with Don Johnson. The whole of the 90s was a bit of a career low for Rourke, who diversified into professional boxing, became co-owner of a West Hollywood gym and got arrested for spousal abuse in 1994. But he did manage to make one good film in the 90s. Vincent Gallo got a great performance from Rourke - as a bookie in his directorial debut, Buffalo 66. And there might be hope for Rourke yet, set to star in a new, incredibly violent, version of Get Carter and, with Gallo, in Peaces Of Ronnie. </p> <p><strong> The role:</strong> Teddy Lewis, criminal acquaintance of sleazy Florida lawyer Ned (William Hurt). </p> <p><strong> Best line:</strong> When Ned wants Teddy's help, Teddy says: \"Any time you try a decent crime you got 50 ways you can fuck up. If you can think of 25 of them then you're a genius. And you ain't no genius.\" </p> <p><strong> Cringe factor:</strong> Low. It's pretty much the same role that Rourke played for most of his early career. It's what happened to him later that makes you want to cringe. </p> <p><strong> Other wannabes:</strong> Ted Danson, pre-Cheers, but post-hairpiece. </p> <p><strong> Critical judgement:</strong> Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times: \"Body Heat is good enough to make film noir play like we hadn't seen it before.\" </p> <p><strong> Also not starring in:</strong> Steven Spielberg's 1979 comedy 1941, as Private Reese. </p> <p> Body Heat, Sky Cinema, Wednesday August 16, 10pm.</p>",

Since 1714, in fact, when Vivaldi premiered his own opera Orlando Finto Pazzo. It ran for six disastrous performances before being put in a drawer for three centuries.</p> <p>\"It is totally awesome to think when I open my mouth nobody has heard this for almost 300 years,\" Mr Watson said of the opera, which opened at the Battersea Arts Centre in London on Friday.</p> <p>Vivaldi is now best known for his Four Seasons, massacred in a million lifts and supermarkets, but he also wrote a wealth of religious and secular music, and several operas.</p> <p>Orlando was staged when he was musical director of the Teatro Sant Angelo in Venice. It was merely unfortunate that its creator launched the opera just as fantastic plots, sorcery, disguises and magic potions were going out of fashion. A few lines of the plot summary give the flavour of the piece: \"As her fairies bewitch Or lando with their songs, Eresilla becomes smitten with Brandimarte, who uses this to rescue Orlando. Grifone tries to capitalise on his reluctant disguise to get closer to Tigrinda by becoming her handmaiden. Origille, now disguised as a man, interrupts them...\"</p> <p>The director, Bill Bankes-Jones, and the conductor, Orlando Jopling, spent months in Italy tracking down and translating the 300-page score and the libretto. \"It was a very strange experience,\" Mr Bankes-Jones said. \"We began to feel we were wandering around in somebody else's script.\"</p> <p>The quest - the texts were in separate cities - took them to Turin, Elba and Venice. The libretto by Grazio Bracciolo exists in a printed version, the music only in Vivaldi's own handwritten copy.</p> <p>Eventually they won the approval of the Instituto di Antonio Vivaldi, and were startled to learn that after three centuries of neglect they had only just pipped a rival production, due to be staged in October in Prague.</p> <p>Transcribing the score had brought them particularly close to the master, Mr Bankes-Jones said. \"It was an extraordinarily personal document. It had wine and food stains, and you could see his writing faltering where he was getting tired and stressed. An aria for one of his women singers, which he rewrote twice, has scrawled on top of it: 'If you don't like this I'm never going to write any music again'.\"</p> <p>The two men founded Tete a Tete opera on a shoestring three years ago, and have mounted three eclectic seasons at the Battersea Arts Centre.</p> <p>The first was The Flying Fox, a version of Die Fledermaus which Johann Strauss might struggle to recognise.

      "bodyText": "When Keel Watson takes a deep breath, fills his enormous lungs, and booms out Orlando's magnificent entrance line - \"Here is the entrance leading to the dark temple!\" - he is singing something which has not been heard on a public stage for some time. Since 1714, in fact, when Vivaldi premiered his own opera Orlando Finto Pazzo. It ran for six disastrous performances before being put in a drawer for three centuries. \"It is totally awesome to think when I open my mouth nobody has heard this for almost 300 years,\" Mr Watson said of the opera, which opened at the Battersea Arts Centre in London on Friday. Vivaldi is now best known for his Four Seasons, massacred in a million lifts and supermarkets, but he also wrote a wealth of religious and secular music, and several operas. Orlando was staged when he was musical director of the Teatro Sant Angelo in Venice. It was merely unfortunate that its creator launched the opera just as fantastic plots, sorcery, disguises and magic potions were going out of fashion. A few lines of the plot summary give the flavour of the piece: \"As her fairies bewitch Or lando with their songs, Eresilla becomes smitten with Brandimarte, who uses this to rescue Orlando. Grifone tries to capitalise on his reluctant disguise to get closer to Tigrinda by becoming her handmaiden. Origille, now disguised as a man, interrupts them...\" The director, Bill Bankes-Jones, and the conductor, Orlando Jopling, spent months in Italy tracking down and translating the 300-page score and the libretto. \"It was a very strange experience,\" Mr Bankes-Jones said. \"We began to feel we were wandering around in somebody else's script.\" The quest - the texts were in separate cities - took them to Turin, Elba and Venice. The libretto by Grazio Bracciolo exists in a printed version, the music only in Vivaldi's own handwritten copy. Eventually they won the approval of the Instituto di Antonio Vivaldi, and were startled to learn that after three centuries of neglect they had only just pipped a rival production, due to be staged in October in Prague. Transcribing the score had brought them particularly close to the master, Mr Bankes-Jones said. \"It was an extraordinarily personal document. It had wine and food stains, and you could see his writing faltering where he was getting tired and stressed. An aria for one of his women singers, which he rewrote twice, has scrawled on top of it: 'If you don't like this I'm never going to write any music again'.\" The two men founded Tete a Tete opera on a shoestring three years ago, and have mounted three eclectic seasons at the Battersea Arts Centre. The first was The Flying Fox, a version of Die Fledermaus which Johann Strauss might struggle to recognise. It was a hit, perhaps because most of the production budget went on a half bottle of champagne per head to encourage the audience to join in and swell the chorus. It got rave reviews, and transferred to the Purcell Room on the South Bank. Last year the company produced Shorts, an evening of new operatic compositions, which was also a box office and critical success and will be revived in a national tour next year. The company will perform only extracts and one complete act of Orlando rather than the entire opera, which would run for up to four hours. But whatever the reaction of the audience to the new production, the opera's reception can only be an improvement on its last time out. Orlando Plays Mad is at Battersea Arts Centre, London, for six performances only. Lengthy waits in the wings \u0095 Another of Vivaldi's works was recently aired for the first time after it was discovered among 80 perfectly preserved manuscripts in the private collection of a family of Piedmontese aristocrats. The unpublished manuscript of L'Improvisataas played in public for the first time in three centuries at Christie's in Rome this summer. \u0095 A collection of 63 Irish jigs written by Beethoven during his \"silent period\" are to be revived after 170 years of neglect. The folk songs, written in the last 10 years of the composer's life as he struggled against growing deafness, will be adapted for full orchestral performances to be aired next May. \u0095 Manuscripts missing for more than 50 years and containing music by Johann Sebastian Bach and his children were unearthed in the Ukraine last August.

      "bodyText": "The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists is considering making a complaint to the Press Complaints Commission over a Mail on Sunday story which claims the college believes that having an abortion can increase a woman's chances of developing breast cancer. The college is incensed by the front page story, which it describes as \"very inaccurate\" and \"the worst kind of journalism\". \"To say we have 'agreed there is a link' is completely false,\" said Allan Templeton, the college's honorary secretary and chairman of its guidelines development committee. \"This story will cause great anxiety, and we probably need to go to the Press Complaints Commission because it is totally inappropriate.\" The newspaper claimed that, after analysing US research, based on 28 separate studies, \"the RCOG has agreed there is a risk of developing cancer after a termination\". Millions of women would be warned by their doctors of the \"worrying link\", and the British Pregnancy Advisory Service - the biggest provider of abortions in the country - would echo this anxiety. Some 180,000 terminations are conducted each year in England and Wales and 12,000 in Scotland, with at least a third of all women having an abortion by the time they reach 45. But yesterday, the royal college said that, after assessing two reviews of all the available research on the subject, it was still not satisfied there was a link. \"We concluded that the evidence as it stood was inconclusive, that there was no evidence definitely pointing towards a link and that, on the other hand, there was much evidence that suggested there was no link at all,\" said Professor Templeton. The Mail on Sunday's story had been based on research, conducted by Joel Brind of the City University of New York, which suggested that women who terminate pregnancies run a 30% greater chance of developing breast cancer. But Prof Templeton cast doubt on the validity of this work, since it relied on case control studies in which women are required to be honest about whether they had had an abortion. Separate research has found that women with breast cancer are more likely to admit to having had an abortion, in the hope of shedding light on a possible cause, than healthier women, who are more preoccupied with stigma. In contrast, studies based on linking national registers of induced abortion with instances of breast cancer were less open to bias, said Prof Templeton. \"Two such studies have not shown any significant association,\" he added. He continued: \"The newspaper has taken one study out of context of the rest of the evidence ... When only those studies least susceptible to bias are included, the evidence suggests that induced abortion does not increase a woman's risk of breast cancer in later life.\" The consultant obstetrician also dismissed the newspaper's claims that, while pregnancy protects a woman from breast cancer, having an abortion deals a \"hormonal blow\" by exposing immature breast cells to carcinogens.

      "body": "<p>Prison service chiefs have redoubled their efforts to tackle the problem of suicide among inmates, amid worrying signs that the number of deaths is likely to reach record levels this year.</p> <p>Martin Narey, the prison service's director-general, has voiced his concern that despite a package of measures to prevent acts of self-harm, the number of prisoners who will take their own lives this year looks set to be even higher than last year's record of 91 deaths.</p> <p>\"I regret to say that the number of suicides does not seem to abate,\" Mr Narey told a conference organised by Unlock, the organisation for ex-offenders. \"We have had 53 suicides so far this year, and for reasons none of us under stand, we seem to have more suicides in the later months of the year. The awful truth is we may have more than 91 suicides this year... We have to find some way of tackling this terrible scourge.\"</p> <p>Prison service chiefs are alarmed that the rate at which suicides are increasing is outstripping the rise in the prison population. More than 20% of male inmates have tried to take their lives at some point before being sent to prison.</p> <p>A great deal of effort has gone into developing ways to help inmates who are contemplating taking their own lives. The practice of isolating vulnerable prisoners in \"strip cells\" has been abandoned, and confidential \"listener schemes\" run by the Samaritans have been greatly expanded. There are also more \"crisis suites\" for those who show suicidal signs.</p> <p>One factor has been the sharp rise in the number of mentally ill people being sent to prison, which has increased seven-fold since the introduction of \"care in the community\" policies.</p> <p>Mr Narey said the prison service planned to modernise its health care centres and would end the practice of employing medical officers whose qualifications would not allow them to work as general practioners in the community.</p> <p>The difficulties facing the prison service over suicides contrast sharply with the progress it is making in combatting illiteracy among prisoners. A major drive to teach reading and numeracy skills has led to 21,000 inmates leaving prison this year with a level 2 national vocational qualification (NVQ) - equivalent to the level achieved by a 14-year-old in school. In the case of many inmates, this would be enough to enable them to break into the job market for the first time in their lives.</p> <p>More than 62,000 NVQ basic skills units were completed by inmates in the past year, which Mr Narey believes provides further evidence that Britain does not have an \"abnormal\" prison population but an uneducated one: \"They are not stupid or incapable,\" he said.</p> <p>Mr Narey also reported that initial research into the effectiveness of sex offender treatment programmes in prisons has proved encouraging. A new study showed that convicted sex offenders released from prison between 1992 and 1996 had reconviction rates that were 59% lower for high risk offenders and 79% lower for low to medium risk offenders if they had undergone a treatment programme before being released.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Prison service chiefs have redoubled their efforts to tackle the problem of suicide among inmates, amid worrying signs that the number of deaths is likely to reach record levels this year. Martin Narey, the prison service's director-general, has voiced his concern that despite a package of measures to prevent acts of self-harm, the number of prisoners who will take their own lives this year looks set to be even higher than last year's record of 91 deaths. \"I regret to say that the number of suicides does not seem to abate,\" Mr Narey told a conference organised by Unlock, the organisation for ex-offenders. \"We have had 53 suicides so far this year, and for reasons none of us under stand, we seem to have more suicides in the later months of the year. The awful truth is we may have more than 91 suicides this year... We have to find some way of tackling this terrible scourge.\" Prison service chiefs are alarmed that the rate at which suicides are increasing is outstripping the rise in the prison population. More than 20% of male inmates have tried to take their lives at some point before being sent to prison. A great deal of effort has gone into developing ways to help inmates who are contemplating taking their own lives. The practice of isolating vulnerable prisoners in \"strip cells\" has been abandoned, and confidential \"listener schemes\" run by the Samaritans have been greatly expanded. There are also more \"crisis suites\" for those who show suicidal signs. One factor has been the sharp rise in the number of mentally ill people being sent to prison, which has increased seven-fold since the introduction of \"care in the community\" policies. Mr Narey said the prison service planned to modernise its health care centres and would end the practice of employing medical officers whose qualifications would not allow them to work as general practioners in the community. The difficulties facing the prison service over suicides contrast sharply with the progress it is making in combatting illiteracy among prisoners. A major drive to teach reading and numeracy skills has led to 21,000 inmates leaving prison this year with a level 2 national vocational qualification (NVQ) - equivalent to the level achieved by a 14-year-old in school. In the case of many inmates, this would be enough to enable them to break into the job market for the first time in their lives. More than 62,000 NVQ basic skills units were completed by inmates in the past year, which Mr Narey believes provides further evidence that Britain does not have an \"abnormal\" prison population but an uneducated one: \"They are not stupid or incapable,\" he said. Mr Narey also reported that initial research into the effectiveness of sex offender treatment programmes in prisons has proved encouraging. A new study showed that convicted sex offenders released from prison between 1992 and 1996 had reconviction rates that were 59% lower for high risk offenders and 79% lower for low to medium risk offenders if they had undergone a treatment programme before being released.",

The media, angry parents, the government and the judiciary would do more to help protect children if they were stressing the need for education, training and support that would effectively equip children with the knowledge, skills and understanding they need to a) recognise the inappropriate behaviour of adults; b) have strategies to counter the coercion of the abuser; and c) know how and where to seek help, in the security they will be believed and listened to.</p> <p>Many survivors of abuse say that if only they had understood what was happening and knew what to do about it, they may well have been able to stop it happening to themselves and others.</p> <p>Marion Lovell-Jones, Bristol</p> <p>\u0095Thirty-five years ago, when I was five, I was sent to see the headmistress at my infant school. The young teacher who sent me didn't know how to deal with me telling her, falteringly, of the sexual abuse inflicted on me by my father. The headmistress listened briefly and then spoke, including the words police and prison. In turmoil, it seemed I had only one option. I said I'd made it all up. My memories had to be buried deep and for many years only re-emerged at times of further abuse.</p> <p>Recent years have allowed me to accept those events. I have periods of deep depression, but have much happiness in my life. Two wonderful sons and a loving extended family and many friends. Even with this, attempting suicide has often seemed the only option.</p> <p>I hope it's apparent, but penal sentences for paedophilia (which is usually incest), a public register, doesn't help anyone. It's not helpful for paedophiles, society, certainly not little girls and boys, or even a 40-year-old survivor. (PS Childline doesn't have enough volunteers or resources to answer all its calls.)</p> <p>Name and address supplied</p> <p>\u0095The home is where the vast majority of child sex abuse takes place. By focusing on the \"monster\" out there, there is a danger that children witnessing this outpouring of public anger will find it even more difficult to disclose what might be happening to them. Such children often feel isolated and fearful of the consequences of revealing that a family member, who might be trusted and loved, is abusing them.

      "bodyText": "Most reporting has failed to reiterate that most sexual abuse is perpetrated not by strangers, but by adults well known to children, in positions of trust and within families; by fathers, grandfathers, brothers and uncles and even female relatives on occasion (Chorus of fear and loathing swells, August 12). The media, angry parents, the government and the judiciary would do more to help protect children if they were stressing the need for education, training and support that would effectively equip children with the knowledge, skills and understanding they need to a) recognise the inappropriate behaviour of adults; b) have strategies to counter the coercion of the abuser; and c) know how and where to seek help, in the security they will be believed and listened to. Many survivors of abuse say that if only they had understood what was happening and knew what to do about it, they may well have been able to stop it happening to themselves and others. Marion Lovell-Jones, Bristol \u0095Thirty-five years ago, when I was five, I was sent to see the headmistress at my infant school. The young teacher who sent me didn't know how to deal with me telling her, falteringly, of the sexual abuse inflicted on me by my father. The headmistress listened briefly and then spoke, including the words police and prison. In turmoil, it seemed I had only one option. I said I'd made it all up. My memories had to be buried deep and for many years only re-emerged at times of further abuse. Recent years have allowed me to accept those events. I have periods of deep depression, but have much happiness in my life. Two wonderful sons and a loving extended family and many friends. Even with this, attempting suicide has often seemed the only option. I hope it's apparent, but penal sentences for paedophilia (which is usually incest), a public register, doesn't help anyone. It's not helpful for paedophiles, society, certainly not little girls and boys, or even a 40-year-old survivor. (PS Childline doesn't have enough volunteers or resources to answer all its calls.) Name and address supplied \u0095The home is where the vast majority of child sex abuse takes place. By focusing on the \"monster\" out there, there is a danger that children witnessing this outpouring of public anger will find it even more difficult to disclose what might be happening to them. Such children often feel isolated and fearful of the consequences of revealing that a family member, who might be trusted and loved, is abusing them. These children often love the perpetrators too and cannot contemplate being separated from them, let alone feel responsible for unleashing such potential violence as demonstrated by the vigilantes, fuelled by sections of the press. We understand the need to keep the spotlight on child abuse, but by demonising certain perpetrators and emphasising the danger without, we run the risk of becoming complacent about the abuse which takes place within families from all backgrounds, races and cultures. Where the emphasis is on the few perpetrators outside the home, safety is an illusion and countless victims remain effectively silenced, unseen and overlooked. Yvonne Harris and Megan Walters Child counsellors, Manchester \u0095I know not how a person becomes a paedophile, be it by nature or nurture, but all paedophiles once were children. I think those people with their lists should consider the possibility that among them are parents of a boy who will become a paedophile. Syd Hambly, Manorbier, Pembrokeshire",

      "bodyText": "A gold wreath 2,350 years old, discovered last month by a farmer in his field outside Salonika, is being brandished by Greeks as the latest evidence of the Greekness of ancient Macedonia, the region now embraced by the Greek province of that name and the independent Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Archaeologists believe the wreath, bearing 30 leaves and two bunches of berries, will provide clues to the worship of Dionysus, the ancient Greek god of wine and revellery. Paintings show gold wreaths being worn by priests attending the often riotous symposia in his honour. It is the third of its kind to have been found, and similarities between the three suggest that they are the work of the same hand. The wreath is being cleaned and assessed by conservators at the Archaeological Museum in Salonika, which was besieged at the weekend by Dionysians disappointed at not being allowed to see it. The director, Chrysanthi Koukouli, said it was likely to be the precursor of a much bigger find in the region. \"If it proves to be the spot [in which it originated], then we may well find an important tomb where some distinguished, well-off and reputable Macedonian citizen was buried,\" he told the daily To Ethnos. Archaeology has often been used in the row over the right to the name Macedonia. Although passions have subsided since the former Yugoslav republic's claim to the name filled Greeks with dread that their landlocked neighbour was laying claim to the Greek province - and its port Salonika - the fear remains. Most liberal-minded Greeks use the title - abbreviated to Fyrom - that the country was given by the UN 1993, and when not referring to its people as Skopjians, after Skopje, the capital, call them Fyromians: a name Slav Macedonians very much hope to drop when the squabble is finally settled later this year.",

Regan, in his magazine Scallywag, had falsely accused the then prime minister of having an affair with Clare Latimer, a Downing Street caterer. Major and Latimer issued writs against Scallywag, its distributor and printer, and against the rather longer established New Statesman. Later Regan, and Scallywag's distributors, were worsted in a legal action brought by Julian Lewis, now a Conservative MP.</p> <p>While legal matters gave Scallywag's founding editor a high public profile, they did not boost its life expectancy. It was, observed Regan in 1999, \"libelled out of existence by actions against innocent retailers\". But, he went on to argue, it had first published many allegations which later received wider publicity.</p> <p>In the 1980s, Regan was living in Weymouth, working as a PR and editing, as a one-man operation - supported by Smartie the parrot and Smokey the cat - Butterfly News. With this magazine, he took on Coca-Cola, the National Farmers Union and the butterfly establishment.</p> <p>Scallywag too began in Dorset. Regan was inspired by Private Eye of the early 1960s, but his magazine started with a narrower range of targets: estate agents, local councils and the nearby brewery.</p> <p>Some 66 issues later he returned to London. With two of his brothers he set up Scallywag as a London, and then, purportedly, a national magazine. Unlike Private Eye, which had succumbed to the lawyers' embrace and in his opinion had been tamed, Scallywag took its chances. But, as anyone who has had connections with such magazines can testify, this is a brisk path to the law courts. There was understandable talking up of its success. Alleged print-runs fuzzed into circulation figures; there was hope, when Major launched his legal attack, of a 100,000 circulation.</p> <p>Regan was born and raised in Hampstead in a multi-tenanted mansion owned by his grandmother, surrounded by card-carrying communists and eccentric east European intellectuals. Educated at Haverstock Hill Comprehensive school, he began his writing career in his teens with poems in John O'London's magazine. He became a journalist in Weymouth before joining the News of the World in 1967.</p> <p>The NoW (\"as British as roast beef and Yorkshire pudding\" as its veteran editor Stafford Sommerfield proclaimed) was one year away from takeover by the then Australian Rupert Murdoch. But its 1940s-austerity diet of sex and scandal was boosted by Regan with his \"probes\" into counter-cultural drugs, debauchery and Trotskyite student conspiracy. He was, he explained in the Guardian this year, smoking a lot of dope, and turning on senior NoW staff, Sommerfield included, with his cannabis-infused cake-mix gateaux.</p> <p>Regan left the NoW in the mid-1970s. Undistinguished biographies of Prince Charles, Princess Margaret and Rupert Murdoch followed. In 1981 he attracted considerable publicity when he obtained what he claimed were transcripts of affectionate phone conversations between Prince Charles and his fianc\u00e9e Lady Diana Spencer. An injunction followed. Then came the return to Weymouth, butterflies and Scallywag.</p> <p>After its death on the news-stands, the magazine lived on, until two years ago, on the Internet. It was a curiously contemporary resort for a journalist whose career was the stuff of George Gissing's great Victorian novel of hackery, New Grub Street. He penned a sub-Auberon Waugh column dedicated to misogyny; through all that work there is a pervasive tone of desperate, old-devil Tory nihilism.

If Andrea Millet is named \"holy mother\" there, she would become an important national symbol of black culture.</p> <p>The succession will be decided officially by the throwing of six seashells and seeing how they land, which in the religion's culture is how the gods make their choice known to the material world.</p> <p>However, the tradition at Gantois has always been for leadership to be passed down to a close female relative. There is strong speculation that the gods will chose Ms Millet, the granddaughter of the previous holy mother.</p> <p>Worshippers have just finished a week of ceremonies marking the 14th anniversary yesterday of the death of their penultimate leader, which clears the way for the new selection within 30 days.</p> <p>Gantois is the best known community of Candomble. Services are often held in Yoruba, an African language, using songs that have been passed down over hundreds of years.</p> <p>The importance of Gantois is due to Maria Escolastica de Nazare, known as \"Mother Little Girl\", who was holy mother there for 64 years before her death, aged 92, in 1986.</p> <p>The country's most charismatic and longstanding Candomble leader, she oversaw the religion's transformation from a hidden cult to an accepted and cherished part of Brazilian heritage.</p> <p>Mother Little Girl was also one of the first Candomble leaders to attract the interest of the white middle classes, when leftwing intellectuals sought refuge within Candomble communities amid the climate of intolerance of the 1950s.</p> <p>Prominent Brazilians including the novelist Jorge Amado, the singer Caetano Veloso and the senate leader Antonio Carlos Magalhaes - all sought her counsel and consider themselves \"children of Gantois\".</p> <p>\"She modernised Candomble without letting it be exploited by tourists. She had prestige because of the credibility she inspired. She never gave up her convictions,\" the historian Cid Teixeira said.</p> <p>Brazil's economy was based on slavery for centuries. The country received more slaves than any other in the west, with most coming through the northeastern state of Bahia. Almost 80% of the population of the state capital, Salvador, is black or of mixed race.</p> <p>Despite Candomble's underground popularity in Bahia, its followers suffered persecution until a law requiring police permission to hold ceremonies was scrapped in the 1970s.</p> <p>The liberalisation coincided with a dramatic growth in worship. In Bahia there are now 3,670 separate Candomble communities.</p> <p>\"I have no doubt that the state has more Candomble houses than it has churches,\" said Antoniel Ataide Bispo, secretary of the Bahian Federation of Afro-Brazilian Worship.</p> <p>In Brazil overall, about 80% of the population is Catholic, making it the world's largest Catholic country.</p> <p>Candomble is now an important part of black identity. In Salvador there are giant sculptures of its orixas - its gods - in the city centre lake.</p> <p>After Mother Little Girl's death the Gantois leadership was passed to her daughter Cleuza. With Cleuza's death in 1998 the house has been in the transition period between holy mothers that can take up to three years.</p> <p>Because of the history of Gantois - the name comes from the French slave trafficker Fran\u00e7ois Gantois who had a property on the land where the house is situated - there is wide regional interest in the succession.</p> <p>The two women thought most likely to be chosen are Cleuza's sister Carmen and Andrea. Cleuza's daughter has reportedly ruled herself out.</p> <p>There is concern that Andrea is too young to take on the job of holy mother, which gives her the responsibility to dispense advice and coordinate the rituals. Mother Little Girl was 28 when she started.</p> <p>Shortly before she died Cleuza appeared to single out the youngest relative.</p> <p>\"Andrea has such a capacity for looking after the [religious energy] that has surprised me. She is only seven, but she is very dedicated and serious,\" she said.</p>",

The succession will be decided officially by the throwing of six seashells and seeing how they land, which in the religion's culture is how the gods make their choice known to the material world. However, the tradition at Gantois has always been for leadership to be passed down to a close female relative. There is strong speculation that the gods will chose Ms Millet, the granddaughter of the previous holy mother. Worshippers have just finished a week of ceremonies marking the 14th anniversary yesterday of the death of their penultimate leader, which clears the way for the new selection within 30 days. Gantois is the best known community of Candomble. Services are often held in Yoruba, an African language, using songs that have been passed down over hundreds of years. The importance of Gantois is due to Maria Escolastica de Nazare, known as \"Mother Little Girl\", who was holy mother there for 64 years before her death, aged 92, in 1986. The country's most charismatic and longstanding Candomble leader, she oversaw the religion's transformation from a hidden cult to an accepted and cherished part of Brazilian heritage. Mother Little Girl was also one of the first Candomble leaders to attract the interest of the white middle classes, when leftwing intellectuals sought refuge within Candomble communities amid the climate of intolerance of the 1950s. Prominent Brazilians including the novelist Jorge Amado, the singer Caetano Veloso and the senate leader Antonio Carlos Magalhaes - all sought her counsel and consider themselves \"children of Gantois\". \"She modernised Candomble without letting it be exploited by tourists. She had prestige because of the credibility she inspired. She never gave up her convictions,\" the historian Cid Teixeira said. Brazil's economy was based on slavery for centuries. The country received more slaves than any other in the west, with most coming through the northeastern state of Bahia. Almost 80% of the population of the state capital, Salvador, is black or of mixed race. Despite Candomble's underground popularity in Bahia, its followers suffered persecution until a law requiring police permission to hold ceremonies was scrapped in the 1970s. The liberalisation coincided with a dramatic growth in worship. In Bahia there are now 3,670 separate Candomble communities. \"I have no doubt that the state has more Candomble houses than it has churches,\" said Antoniel Ataide Bispo, secretary of the Bahian Federation of Afro-Brazilian Worship. In Brazil overall, about 80% of the population is Catholic, making it the world's largest Catholic country. Candomble is now an important part of black identity. In Salvador there are giant sculptures of its orixas - its gods - in the city centre lake. After Mother Little Girl's death the Gantois leadership was passed to her daughter Cleuza. With Cleuza's death in 1998 the house has been in the transition period between holy mothers that can take up to three years. Because of the history of Gantois - the name comes from the French slave trafficker Fran\u00e7ois Gantois who had a property on the land where the house is situated - there is wide regional interest in the succession. The two women thought most likely to be chosen are Cleuza's sister Carmen and Andrea. Cleuza's daughter has reportedly ruled herself out. There is concern that Andrea is too young to take on the job of holy mother, which gives her the responsibility to dispense advice and coordinate the rituals. Mother Little Girl was 28 when she started. Shortly before she died Cleuza appeared to single out the youngest relative. \"Andrea has such a capacity for looking after the [religious energy] that has surprised me. She is only seven, but she is very dedicated and serious,\" she said.",
