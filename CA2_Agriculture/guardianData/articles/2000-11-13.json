Saudi Arabia and other Opec nations want compensation for any potential losses from reduced oil exports. Sinks The biosphere and the oceans store and release carbon and are part of the global carbon cycle. However, planting trees rather than reducing emissions from fossil fuels will not save the global climate. The biosphere cannot store all the carbon we could release, which is currently underground in the form of oil, gas and coal.

As they are included now, we argue for accounting rules that will make it impossible for parties to count activities such as normal forest harvesting as climate protection measures. Flexible mechanisms Flexible mechanisms were created under the Kyoto agreement to enable industrialised countries to achieve emissions cuts or buy emission \"credits\" abroad, reducing the need for domestic action. There are three of these mechanisms: Joint Implementation (JI), the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and International Emissions Trading (IET). JI allows projects to reduce emissions in other developed countries (ie deals between Annex 1 countries). The CDM allows for similar projects in developing countries (ie deals between Annex 1 and non-Annex 1 countries). Both those will enable Annex 1 countries to claim emission credits. IET will allow Annex 1 countries that have achieved emissions reductions over and above those required by their Kyoto target to 'sell' their excess to countries finding it more difficult or expensive to meet their commitments. The US, Canada and others argue for maximum use of emissions trading. The EU wants a limit to use of the mechanisms, obliging countries to countries meet at least half of their emissions reductions targets through domestic action.

Friends of the Earth and other environmentalists would like to see at least an 80% requirement for domestic action. The economies of the developed countries must be greened if action to fight climate change is to be effective in the long term. Compliance It is crucial that Kyoto obligations be enforced. Otherwise the targets will lose all credibility. Japan and Russia are currently opposing binding consequences altogether. The USA and others want \"borrowing\". Countries that do not fulfil their obligations would able to deduct the excess emissions from their next commitment period budget, without further sanctions. The EU suggests a \"compliance fund\" which would mean that countries have to pay money into a fund which would then be used to either buy credits abroad or to implement real reduction projects. Solutions Climate scientists have suggested that atmospheric CO2 concentrations should be kept below 450ppm, or approximately twice pre-industrial concentrations, in order to avoid catastrophic consequences. This will require first stabilisation, and then substantial reduction of global CO2 emissions from current levels. Friends of the Earth argues that to achieve this, industrialised countries must make deep cuts in their greenhouse gas emissions, of up to 90% by 2050. Developed countries will need to switch from dependence on fossil fuels to investment in renewable energy sources and energy efficiency measures.

Much of this energy is emitted back into space in the form of long wave radiation, but some of this radiation is trapped in the atmosphere by a blanket of water vapour and trace gases called 'greenhouse gases'. Without this natural greenhouse effect, the earth would be about 30\u00b0C colder than it is today.</p> <p>The main naturally occurring greenhouse gases are water vapour, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Additional greenhouse gases are released by industrial processes: artificial chemicals called halocarbons (CFCs, HFCs, PFCs) and long-lived gases such as sulphur hexafluoride (SF6).</p> <p>Carbon dioxide is the most important greenhouse gas generated by mankind, accounting for about two thirds of the human-induced greenhouse effect.</p> <p>Plants and animals have exchanged carbon dioxide with the atmosphere in a carbon cycle that has remained in balance for the last 10,000 years. However, since the industrial revolution, human activities have disturbed this balance mainly through burning fossil fuels (oil, coal and gas) which produces CO2, the destruction of forests, which releases stored carbon, and the intensive rearing of cattle and high scale plantation of rice, which produces methane.</p> <p>Carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere have increased by about 30% in the last 200 years, from less than 280 parts per million (ppm) to 368 ppm today.</p> <p>If we continue to burn fossil fuels at our current rate, atmospheric carbon dioxide will be twice pre-industrial levels by 2030, and three times that figure by 2100.</p> <p><strong>It's getting warmer</strong></p> <p>As concentrations of greenhouse gases rise, the earth's atmosphere is warming up.</p> <p>The global average temperature has risen by almost 0.7\u00b0C over the last century, very probably as a result of human activity.

      "body": "<p>After \"sorry\", a word the Australian prime minister John Howard still refuses to utter to the country's Aborigines, the most contentious word in Australia at the moment is probably \"nigger\".</p> <p>A tale of two nicknames unfolded last week. As a white judge ruled that it was okay for whites to call another white man \"nigger\", a black activist was under fire from whites for naming himself the politicians' \"pet nigger\".</p> <p>On Friday, a federal court judge said that a Queensland sports ground, with a stand that was named after local rugby player ES \"Nigger\" Brown in the 1960s, did not contravene Australia's racial discrimination laws.</p> <p>The trustees of Toowooba's Athletic Oval said that the stand commemorated Edwin \"Nigger\" Brown, the town's first international rugby league player, who toured Britain in the 1920s.</p> <p>\"Nigger\" Brown, who died in 1972, was white, not Aborigine. Local whites said he had earned his \"ironic\" nickname because of his extremely fair complexion and incongruous surname.</p> <p>The judge accepted that the use of \"nigger\" could be racist, but ruled that it was not in this context, striking out a claim by a local Aborigine, Stephen Hagan, that the sign was offensive.</p> <p>Implying that no stone mason could be racist, the judge noted that even Mr Brown's gravestone bore the words Edward Stanley \"Nigger\" Brown.</p> <p>Meanwhile, several thousand kilometres north west of Toowoomba, in the arid north of Australia's \"top end\", another man with a contentious nickname, Tracker Tilmouth, stirred up anger in the Northern Territory branch of the Labour party.</p> <p>Mr Tilmouth was nicknamed \"Tracker\" years ago by a fellow Aboriginal politician, because his initials, LBT, spelt out \"little black Tracker\".</p> <p>It was a joke: since European settlement, whites have exploited Aborigines for their hunting skills, forcing them to track down everything from stray bullocks to escaped prisoners.</p> <p>Now Tracker was truly domesticated - more like Labour's \"pet nigger\", he told a local newspaper. \"I'm allowed to mow the lawns, but I'm not allowed on the veranda,\" he explained, criticising Labour for marginalising its Aboriginal members, choosing non-Aboriginal candidates and failing to act in the interests of Aborigines.</p> <p>He warned that, in future elections, the Labour party could not continue to rely on the black vote in the region.</p> <p>Local Labour politicians were furious. \"In today's Australia, the only Aboriginal people treated, to use Tracker's most unfortunate expression, as pet niggers, are people who allow themselves to be treated like that,\" said former Northern Territory senator Bob Collins.</p> <p>\"I just put it down to Tracker and his colourful language,\" said Northern Territory Labour leader Clare Martin dismissively.</p> <p>Political friends of Mr Tilmouth suggest his frustration at the lack of headway Aborigines are making in Australia's white-dominated political institutions simply got the better of him.</p> <p>He was widely tipped to become a Labour senator three years ago, but was opposed by factions in the NT Labour party. One of those who was reported to have blocked his nomination was Mr Collins.</p> <p>Aborigines make up a third of the Northern Territory's population. Two of Labour's seven politicians in the 25-member legislative assembly are Aboriginal, but the party is stuck in permanent opposition and there are no other Aboriginal members in the assembly.</p> <p>The state, governed by the conservative Country Liberal party, is famous for its mandatory sentencing laws, which lead to the \"zero tolerance\" jailing of many Aborigines for minor offences.</p> <p>For instance, last week, an Aboriginal man was jailed for 14 days in the Northern Territory for stealing a six-pack of beer while drunk two-and-a-half years ago.</p> <p>Nationally, there are more than 400,000 Aborigines in Australia, just over 2% of the country's population.</p> <p>But none of the current federal government or the Labour opposition are Aboriginal.

      "bodyText": "After \"sorry\", a word the Australian prime minister John Howard still refuses to utter to the country's Aborigines, the most contentious word in Australia at the moment is probably \"nigger\". A tale of two nicknames unfolded last week. As a white judge ruled that it was okay for whites to call another white man \"nigger\", a black activist was under fire from whites for naming himself the politicians' \"pet nigger\". On Friday, a federal court judge said that a Queensland sports ground, with a stand that was named after local rugby player ES \"Nigger\" Brown in the 1960s, did not contravene Australia's racial discrimination laws. The trustees of Toowooba's Athletic Oval said that the stand commemorated Edwin \"Nigger\" Brown, the town's first international rugby league player, who toured Britain in the 1920s. \"Nigger\" Brown, who died in 1972, was white, not Aborigine. Local whites said he had earned his \"ironic\" nickname because of his extremely fair complexion and incongruous surname. The judge accepted that the use of \"nigger\" could be racist, but ruled that it was not in this context, striking out a claim by a local Aborigine, Stephen Hagan, that the sign was offensive. Implying that no stone mason could be racist, the judge noted that even Mr Brown's gravestone bore the words Edward Stanley \"Nigger\" Brown. Meanwhile, several thousand kilometres north west of Toowoomba, in the arid north of Australia's \"top end\", another man with a contentious nickname, Tracker Tilmouth, stirred up anger in the Northern Territory branch of the Labour party. Mr Tilmouth was nicknamed \"Tracker\" years ago by a fellow Aboriginal politician, because his initials, LBT, spelt out \"little black Tracker\". It was a joke: since European settlement, whites have exploited Aborigines for their hunting skills, forcing them to track down everything from stray bullocks to escaped prisoners. Now Tracker was truly domesticated - more like Labour's \"pet nigger\", he told a local newspaper. \"I'm allowed to mow the lawns, but I'm not allowed on the veranda,\" he explained, criticising Labour for marginalising its Aboriginal members, choosing non-Aboriginal candidates and failing to act in the interests of Aborigines. He warned that, in future elections, the Labour party could not continue to rely on the black vote in the region. Local Labour politicians were furious. \"In today's Australia, the only Aboriginal people treated, to use Tracker's most unfortunate expression, as pet niggers, are people who allow themselves to be treated like that,\" said former Northern Territory senator Bob Collins. \"I just put it down to Tracker and his colourful language,\" said Northern Territory Labour leader Clare Martin dismissively. Political friends of Mr Tilmouth suggest his frustration at the lack of headway Aborigines are making in Australia's white-dominated political institutions simply got the better of him. He was widely tipped to become a Labour senator three years ago, but was opposed by factions in the NT Labour party. One of those who was reported to have blocked his nomination was Mr Collins. Aborigines make up a third of the Northern Territory's population. Two of Labour's seven politicians in the 25-member legislative assembly are Aboriginal, but the party is stuck in permanent opposition and there are no other Aboriginal members in the assembly. The state, governed by the conservative Country Liberal party, is famous for its mandatory sentencing laws, which lead to the \"zero tolerance\" jailing of many Aborigines for minor offences. For instance, last week, an Aboriginal man was jailed for 14 days in the Northern Territory for stealing a six-pack of beer while drunk two-and-a-half years ago. Nationally, there are more than 400,000 Aborigines in Australia, just over 2% of the country's population. But none of the current federal government or the Labour opposition are Aboriginal. Black judges are also practically unheard of. So the name game goes on. \"You look at it in a couple of contexts,\" said one local Aborigine, Wally McCarthy, during the long-running Toowoomba sports ground saga. \"We use 'nigger' a lot. You know, we've got black people that we call 'nigger'... [but] I'm 65 and I'll fight if somebody calls me 'nigger'.\" However, the absence of Aborigines at the apex of Australian society underlines that it is more commonly white judges and white politicians who determine when \"nigger\" is nice and when it is nasty.

      "bodyText": "Foul-mouthed Channel 4 technicians have earned the channel a slapped wrist from TV watchdogs after they were caught swearing during the broadcast of this year's Party in the Park. Five viewers complained to the Independent Television Commission about two uses of four-letter words during Channel 4's T4 coverage of the Capital Radio event, which went out at 12.30pm. Viewers were treated to shouted instructions next to an open mike during the live broadcast. Channel 4 protested that the event had a \"previously unblemished\" record for strong language and said they had taken steps to prevent the accidental broadcasting of bad language. Nevertheless the ITC found Channel 4 in breach of section 1.4 of its programme code, which bans \"profanity\" before the 9pm watershed. MTV got itself into hot water after Iggy Pop and Boyzone's Shane Lynch uttered a string of expletives on its annual MTV Music Awards, some of which went out before the watershed. MTV said that it was impossible to prevent bad language altogether. Channel 5's raunchy show, X Certificate, also came under fire for the explicit nature of its clips. The broadcaster argued that it was a late-night show and that the material shown was available in video shops. But the ITC still found some scenes offensive. The ITC's findings come in the wake of the resignation of Lord Holme, chief executive of the other broadcasting watchdog, the Broadcasting Standards Commission, following News of the World revelations about his private life.",

At the Drumchapel disabled action group, a body with close links to Mr Dewar, chairman Andrew McNaught worried that Anniesland would never find another politician to match him. \"It may be a Labour stronghold, but they are going to have to do a lot of work to try to convince the electorate that these are the men to take over Donald's mantle,\" he said. \"I don't think they will have the rapport with the electorate that Donald had. He came here a lot, and he used to say he didn't feel that our opportunities should be any less because of where we lived. You felt he meant it. You felt he was one of us.\" 1997 general election result Donald Dewar (below) Lab 20,951 William Wilson SNP 5,797 Andrew Brocklehurst C 3,881 Christopher McGinty LD 2,453 Labour majority 15,154 But past loyalty and respect for the dead do not win ballots.

After three defeats on the trot, all the talk last week was of Real Madrid in crisis. This week it's Bar\u00e7a's turn. </p> <p>After crashing out of the Champions League in midweek, the Catalans plunged new depths with a 2-1 home defeat against Villarreal in a game that saw 13 yellow cards (but miraculously no red ones). Bar\u00e7a were 1-0 down after just 32 seconds - none of their players had even touched the ball when V\u00edctor beat Arnau with embarrassing ease to open the scoring. The home side equalised through Cocu, but were made to pay for a whole host of missed opportunities when V\u00edctor clinched Villarreal's victory minutes into the second half. </p> <p>The defeat leaves Barcelona outside the Uefa Cup places and manager Lorenzo Serra Ferrer deep in trouble. The Mallorcan has a problem - the same problem that Robson and Van Gaal had, in fact - he's not Johan Cruyff. But at least Robson and Van Gaal managed to win things. Serra Ferrer, on the other hand, has done little to suggest that he's going to bring any nice shiny trophies to the Catalan capital. Actually, maybe he has. Maybe it's all part of a master plan - the Uefa Cup has to be easier to win than the Champions League, after all. </p> <p>The manager can't be blamed for losing Luis Figo, of course, and most of the cul\u00e9s were happy enough when he dismantled Van Gaal's Ajax team - and delighted when Jari Littmanen disappeared from the starting line-up. </p> <p>Serra Ferrer also successfully broke up the De Boer brothers at last, selling Dire De Boer to Rangers - where, amazingly, he passed the medical - and keeping Decent De Boer at the Nou Camp. But his summer signings haven't impressed. Comedy Keeper Dutruel and Marc Overmars have been especially unpopular. Meanwhile, Gerard, and Alfonso - who seems to have left his white scoring boots in Bruges - have spent most of the season on the bench. A number of players have already expressed their doubts about Serra Ferrer's system. And who wouldn't with Manu Petit playing at left back?</p> <p>Bar\u00e7a president Joan Gaspart is openly looking for a manager for next season, but it won't be a surprise to see Serra Ferrer packing his bags sooner rather than later.</p> <p>There is nothing like disaster at Bar\u00e7a to cheer up the madridistas - throw in a 5-1 victory and delirium sets in. To add the finishing touch, arch-centralist and Bar\u00e7a-hater, Fernando Hierro was the main man with two goals. And it could have been even better, too, had the captain not missed a last minute penalty after \u00c1lvaro had brought down McManaman. Guti, the latest addition to Camacho's national squad, Savio and Ra\u00fal completed the scoring. </p> <p>Amid the delight, spare a thought for the Mayor of Las Palmas, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Soria L\u00f3pez. It was all rather too much for him to take and he had to be rushed to hospital after the game - although he's since been given the all clear.</p> <p>Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a and Valencia lead the table, both on 20 points. Depor saw off Zaragoza 2-0, with two goals either side of half time from Diego Trist\u00e1n. Trist\u00e1n lobbed Zaragoza keeper Juanmi for the first, before completing the scoring in the second half with an excellent finish after a fine Depor move. </p> <p>Valencia didn't enjoy life quite so much this weekend and had to rely on a last minute goal from Diego Alonso to secure a 2-2 draw against Rayo at the Mestalla. Rayo had taken the lead with two fabulous goals. The first was a classic 50-yard lob from Elvir Bolic that made James Beattie's effort at the weekend look like what it was - an aimless hoof that got lucky. </p> <p>Midfielder M\u00edchel scored the second with another (not quite so) great strike in the 52nd minute. It was the brilliant Mendieta - of course - who led Valencia's comeback with a goal ten minutes later, before John Carew set up Diego Alonso for the equaliser right on time. </p> <p>Things are looking bleak at the bottom of the table for Real Sociedad, who lost 1-0 against Oviedo, thanks to another goal from local hero Oli. No disgrace there - Radi Antic's side, who are unbeaten in the New - and very impressive - Carlos Tartiere, boast the best home record in the division. If only their away form was as good. </p> <p>Just above Real Sociedad are Racing and Osasuna who, true to form, played out a 0-0 draw yesterday. Above them lie Athletic (who beat Celta 2-1), M\u00e1laga and Espanyol (who between them produced another 0-0 bore), and Valladolid who miraculously avoided yet another 1-1 draw with a winner 17 minutes from time against high-flying Alav\u00e9s. </p> <p>Never ones to shy away from publicity, Spanish referees are back in the news. From January the Hijos de Puta will be sponsored by digital television company QuieroTV and will wear the company's logo on their shirts. Francesc Fern\u00e1ndez Ontineros, secretary general of Media Park, the company that helped broker the deal, claimed that this was a \"step forward on the road to the professionalisation of referees\". Yeah, right. That's what it is. It surely won't be long till QuieroTV offers its viewers all sorts of wonderful new angles from its revolutionary RefCam. </p> <p>Rumours that SpecSavers are lining up a similar deal in the Premiership are yet to be confirmed.

I am ready to receive my reward in heaven - travelling.</p> <p>I have long been consumed with the desire to travel. Pre-divorce, it was camping and car-sick children, with an occasional trip to France. It is one of life's small mysteries as to why all teachers are such Francophiles. In seven post-divorce years I have only been able to manage three holidays: a first-time skiing trip to Italy - experiencing an equal measure of terror and exhilaration; a walking trip in Romania - feeling a curious mixture of envy and guilt at the simple but harsh peasant life; and a cheap week in Kefalonia where the beauty of the island took my breath away every single day. I am currently saving for a trip to Nepal. At this rate I will have to live to the age of 150 to make a small dent on where I want to go.</p> <p>My just-graduated son is also applying to be a Netjetter but I say to him and all the young: sod off. Let him watch Big Brother and read The Beach [not bother with the film]. He will have other chances. Which of us would be the most excited by the adventure, the most awe-struck by of the wonders of this planet, the most appreciative of the diversity of its cultures? I would consider it an honour to represent the Shirley Valentines and Bridget Joneses of this world. I would try my hardest to live up to all the dreams of middleagedwomankind - we are a feisty lot!</p> <p>Where do I want to go? EVERYWHERE and ANYWHERE - definitely every continent. I do not know if a detailed itinerary is required. I can't be bothered to work that out now. It is too exciting just to think about the whole concept. I will just throw out a few places high on my wish list: Prague, Krakow, St Petersburg, on to China, Nepal, into India, join the backpackers in South-East Asia, pop to Australia and New Zealand, across to South America, any part will do but must include Peru, up to the Caribbean, I suppose I must include the States, if only to test out my long-held prejudices, Canada if time... I have just looked at an atlas and realised I have missed out Africa! I am sure I can fit it in somewhere.The beauty of six months and a world-wide ticket would be the freedom to be side-tracked, to be guided by other travellers and Guardian Unlimited readers, to go where the nose or the eyes lead. My heart is beating so fast just thinking about it.</p> <p>I may not have a job to come back to. I would certainly have a lot of debts. It would be well-worth it! I could live off the memories for the same amount of time it would take me to pay off the debts - probably the rest of my life. My family [apart from my son] and colleagues think I am mad to even apply - I probably am... but I can dream.</p> <p>I want to be a Netjetter.</p>",

      "bodyText": "I want to be a Netjetter. I am fifty, fairly fit and fed-up. I am overworked, underpaid (public sector - worthy work but worthless pay) and impoverished by student offspring. I am ready to receive my reward in heaven - travelling. I have long been consumed with the desire to travel. Pre-divorce, it was camping and car-sick children, with an occasional trip to France. It is one of life's small mysteries as to why all teachers are such Francophiles. In seven post-divorce years I have only been able to manage three holidays: a first-time skiing trip to Italy - experiencing an equal measure of terror and exhilaration; a walking trip in Romania - feeling a curious mixture of envy and guilt at the simple but harsh peasant life; and a cheap week in Kefalonia where the beauty of the island took my breath away every single day. I am currently saving for a trip to Nepal. At this rate I will have to live to the age of 150 to make a small dent on where I want to go. My just-graduated son is also applying to be a Netjetter but I say to him and all the young: sod off. Let him watch Big Brother and read The Beach [not bother with the film]. He will have other chances. Which of us would be the most excited by the adventure, the most awe-struck by of the wonders of this planet, the most appreciative of the diversity of its cultures? I would consider it an honour to represent the Shirley Valentines and Bridget Joneses of this world. I would try my hardest to live up to all the dreams of middleagedwomankind - we are a feisty lot! Where do I want to go? EVERYWHERE and ANYWHERE - definitely every continent. I do not know if a detailed itinerary is required. I can't be bothered to work that out now. It is too exciting just to think about the whole concept. I will just throw out a few places high on my wish list: Prague, Krakow, St Petersburg, on to China, Nepal, into India, join the backpackers in South-East Asia, pop to Australia and New Zealand, across to South America, any part will do but must include Peru, up to the Caribbean, I suppose I must include the States, if only to test out my long-held prejudices, Canada if time... I have just looked at an atlas and realised I have missed out Africa! I am sure I can fit it in somewhere.The beauty of six months and a world-wide ticket would be the freedom to be side-tracked, to be guided by other travellers and Guardian Unlimited readers, to go where the nose or the eyes lead. My heart is beating so fast just thinking about it. I may not have a job to come back to. I would certainly have a lot of debts. It would be well-worth it! I could live off the memories for the same amount of time it would take me to pay off the debts - probably the rest of my life. My family [apart from my son] and colleagues think I am mad to even apply - I probably am... but I can dream. I want to be a Netjetter.",

      "body": "<p><strong>WOUND WITH A VIEW</strong></p> <p>The England squad is like a night out with Billie Piper - people are falling down all over the place. This morning saw loveable young thug Alan Smith drop out due to \"tiredness\" and Manchester United's Wes Brown withdraw with seafood poisoning, oh alright then, a knee injury. This afternoon brought even worse news for Peter Taylor, as Paul Scholes and Michael Owen won't be playing either. Fortunately, Paul Ince should still be waiting on standby (he's heard it's a high stakes game).</p> <p>Owen only did a spot of light training this morning, but that was still enough to exacerbate a back injury which will stop him from travelling. Scholes managed a full session, but will not risk the thigh he strained during United's 2-1 win over Boro on Saturday. Gareth Southgate will be fit, however, having failed to be inconvenienced by a cheek injury. \"I think it will be very difficult to stop Gareth going anywhere,\" said John Gregory, who has managed to stop him from leaving Villa Park for ages.</p> <p>One piece of good news - unless you possess a copy of No Surrender to the IRA on 7-inch - is that Svennis looks likely to take part-time charge of England for the two World Cup qualifying matches next March. Lazio had sounded frosty about letting their coach do two jobs at once, but club vice-president Dino Zoff said today: \"We want to do everything we can to help the English Football Association. It will be difficult because of his commitment to Lazio, but Mr Eriksson is very keen to get involved for the games and we want to help him.\" Astonishing! Please excuse the Fiver while we faint in the toilets.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>McFIVER'S RESTAURANT</strong></p> <p>Hungry for burgers? Then come to McFiver's - the home of football-related fast food where the surfaces are wiped clean nearly every day! Once you've sunk your teeth into one of our meaty baps, we guarantee you'll be hooked. Take the Big Merse, for example. It's a 100% ham topped with plenty of cheese, and every one comes served with a liberal helping of chippy comment.</p> <p>So take a bite and let the unctuous flavour of 'urging Aston Villa to buy some more players to make sure of a place in Europe' ooze out. \"People like McDonald's are at the top of their sphere, selling more fast food than anyone else. But they still pump more and more money into advertising because they want to stay top dogs. Villa have to adopt the same philosophy in terms of football.\"</p> <p>Also, if you buy a Big Merse as part of a Smiles Meal, you'll get a free plastic talking dinosaur which insists that Villa should settle for nothing less than Big Cup football. \"This is a better team than when I came here two years ago. You have to be realistic and say that Manchester United and Arsenal are a long way clear. But the top three is realistic for us if we strengthen. That's what I believe otherwise there would be no point coming into training every day.\" Mmm, that sure tastes booze-renouncin' good!!!</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"It happened in slow motion. But now I've this kind of lease of life like, isn't it good to be alive!\" - Parma coach Alberto Malesani in reflective mood upon being airlifted to hospital after fracturing his collar bone in a near-fatal car crash.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>HOUSE MEETING</strong></p> <p>As far as the Fiver is concerned, Liverpool's dock area has never been the same since Richard and Judy migrated south. Yes, it's a far livelier place, with lots of interesting things to do and far fewer plebs in matching macs squashing their faces against a window in the hope of getting on TV. And this Saturday, Everton fans will vote on whether to improve the area even further by ditching the venerable Goodison Park and building a new 50,000-plus ground on the King's Dock.</p> <p>While club officials look set to reject calls for an American-style vote, whereby voters punch a hole in Peter Johnson, there is a lot of anticipation ahead of the weekend. Although the Everton faithful were polled on leaving Goodison Park in 1997, this is the first time they've been offered an actual alternative to the current ground. However, rumours that fans will be able to vote on the inclusion of in-ground escalators and snack machines at the end of every row remain just that.</p> <p>For chief Toffee Bill Kenwright, there is a lot riding on this vote. The theatrical impresario (you should see his Chichester Festival Hall) is currently facing down rumours of continuing financial difficulty at the club, and talk that Walter Smith might resign as manager - fears today refuted by Smith himself. He is also trying to revive a foundering \u00a326m investment deal with NTL, for whom the promise of a new stadium could be crucial. So it's a big vote and no mistake. Let's hope it goes well or they may get a new 70,000-seater Pat Buchanan.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Internazionale striker Robbie Keane is set to move to Reggina on loan until the end of the season, according to reports in Italy.</p> <p>Celtic have denied making a bid for Leicester midfielder Neil Lennon. \"Somebody said I had put in a \u00a37m offer but that is nonsense,\" said manager Martin O'Neill. \"I will keep speculation for another time.\"</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>NEWS IN BRIEF</strong></p> <p>Derby have signed Scotland defender Brian O'Neil in a swap deal which takes Stefan Schnoor to Wolfsburg. Meanwhile, Taribo West also joined the Rams today on a three-month loan from Internazionale after securing a work permit.</p> <p>Kaiserslautern have signed Tottenham Hotspur winger Jose Dominguez for an unspecified fee.</p> <p>Middlesbrough defender Gianluca Festa has handed in a transfer request after dropping behind Ugo Ehiogu, Gary Pallister, Colin Cooper, Steve Vickers and Dean Gordon in the Riverside pecking order.</p> <p>Patrik Berger has undergone knee surgery in the US and the operation has been declared a success.

      "bodyText": "WOUND WITH A VIEW The England squad is like a night out with Billie Piper - people are falling down all over the place. This morning saw loveable young thug Alan Smith drop out due to \"tiredness\" and Manchester United's Wes Brown withdraw with seafood poisoning, oh alright then, a knee injury. This afternoon brought even worse news for Peter Taylor, as Paul Scholes and Michael Owen won't be playing either. Fortunately, Paul Ince should still be waiting on standby (he's heard it's a high stakes game). Owen only did a spot of light training this morning, but that was still enough to exacerbate a back injury which will stop him from travelling. Scholes managed a full session, but will not risk the thigh he strained during United's 2-1 win over Boro on Saturday. Gareth Southgate will be fit, however, having failed to be inconvenienced by a cheek injury. \"I think it will be very difficult to stop Gareth going anywhere,\" said John Gregory, who has managed to stop him from leaving Villa Park for ages. One piece of good news - unless you possess a copy of No Surrender to the IRA on 7-inch - is that Svennis looks likely to take part-time charge of England for the two World Cup qualifying matches next March. Lazio had sounded frosty about letting their coach do two jobs at once, but club vice-president Dino Zoff said today: \"We want to do everything we can to help the English Football Association. It will be difficult because of his commitment to Lazio, but Mr Eriksson is very keen to get involved for the games and we want to help him.\" Astonishing! Please excuse the Fiver while we faint in the toilets. * * * * * * * * * * * * * McFIVER'S RESTAURANT Hungry for burgers? Then come to McFiver's - the home of football-related fast food where the surfaces are wiped clean nearly every day! Once you've sunk your teeth into one of our meaty baps, we guarantee you'll be hooked. Take the Big Merse, for example. It's a 100% ham topped with plenty of cheese, and every one comes served with a liberal helping of chippy comment. So take a bite and let the unctuous flavour of 'urging Aston Villa to buy some more players to make sure of a place in Europe' ooze out. \"People like McDonald's are at the top of their sphere, selling more fast food than anyone else. But they still pump more and more money into advertising because they want to stay top dogs. Villa have to adopt the same philosophy in terms of football.\" Also, if you buy a Big Merse as part of a Smiles Meal, you'll get a free plastic talking dinosaur which insists that Villa should settle for nothing less than Big Cup football. \"This is a better team than when I came here two years ago. You have to be realistic and say that Manchester United and Arsenal are a long way clear. But the top three is realistic for us if we strengthen. That's what I believe otherwise there would be no point coming into training every day.\" Mmm, that sure tastes booze-renouncin' good!!! * * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"It happened in slow motion. But now I've this kind of lease of life like, isn't it good to be alive!\" - Parma coach Alberto Malesani in reflective mood upon being airlifted to hospital after fracturing his collar bone in a near-fatal car crash. * * * * * * * * * * * * * HOUSE MEETING As far as the Fiver is concerned, Liverpool's dock area has never been the same since Richard and Judy migrated south. Yes, it's a far livelier place, with lots of interesting things to do and far fewer plebs in matching macs squashing their faces against a window in the hope of getting on TV. And this Saturday, Everton fans will vote on whether to improve the area even further by ditching the venerable Goodison Park and building a new 50,000-plus ground on the King's Dock. While club officials look set to reject calls for an American-style vote, whereby voters punch a hole in Peter Johnson, there is a lot of anticipation ahead of the weekend. Although the Everton faithful were polled on leaving Goodison Park in 1997, this is the first time they've been offered an actual alternative to the current ground. However, rumours that fans will be able to vote on the inclusion of in-ground escalators and snack machines at the end of every row remain just that. For chief Toffee Bill Kenwright, there is a lot riding on this vote. The theatrical impresario (you should see his Chichester Festival Hall) is currently facing down rumours of continuing financial difficulty at the club, and talk that Walter Smith might resign as manager - fears today refuted by Smith himself. He is also trying to revive a foundering \u00a326m investment deal with NTL, for whom the promise of a new stadium could be crucial. So it's a big vote and no mistake. Let's hope it goes well or they may get a new 70,000-seater Pat Buchanan. * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Internazionale striker Robbie Keane is set to move to Reggina on loan until the end of the season, according to reports in Italy. Celtic have denied making a bid for Leicester midfielder Neil Lennon. \"Somebody said I had put in a \u00a37m offer but that is nonsense,\" said manager Martin O'Neill. \"I will keep speculation for another time.\" * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Derby have signed Scotland defender Brian O'Neil in a swap deal which takes Stefan Schnoor to Wolfsburg. Meanwhile, Taribo West also joined the Rams today on a three-month loan from Internazionale after securing a work permit. Kaiserslautern have signed Tottenham Hotspur winger Jose Dominguez for an unspecified fee. Middlesbrough defender Gianluca Festa has handed in a transfer request after dropping behind Ugo Ehiogu, Gary Pallister, Colin Cooper, Steve Vickers and Dean Gordon in the Riverside pecking order. Patrik Berger has undergone knee surgery in the US and the operation has been declared a success. The Liverpool midfielder could be back in action by March. Former AIK Stockholm boss Stuart Baxter has claimed Hearts are considering him for the vacant manager's job at Tynecastle. \"All I know right now is that they Hearts have shown an interest, nothing more,\" said Baxter. But chief executive Chris Robinson has denied the claim: \"The club have not spoken to or approached anyone but Stuart Baxter has come forward of his volition.\" Napoli, bottom of Serie A, have sacked coach Zdenek Zeman after five months in charge. The chain-smoking Czech will be replaced by Emiliano Mondonico, formerly coach of Torino. John Sheran has taken over as Montrose manager on a permanent basis. Sheran had been caretaker boss since Kevin Drinkell's departure last month. Ian McPhee has left his post as manager of Forfar by mutual consent. * * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO ITV: Uefa Big Cup Weekly (11.30pm) The upper classes at play.

Ms Frostrup's presence and her subject matter - reality TV shows - simply did not curry favour with Panorama's heartland viewers, many of whom defected either to ITV for the first programme in the third series of Cold Feet or to Channel 4's movie, the English Patient. The Sunday night special attracted 2.7m viewers, 13% of audience share and the second lowest figure since the programme was moved from Monday night five weeks ago. And although a BBC News spokeswoman stressed that viewing figures were in line with what Panorama's been getting since the programme was shifted, the experiment is not likely to have been seen as a success. Using a celebrity presenter to front the programme was always a risk and viewing figures suggest that the further the programme veers from its old-school, hard current affairs format, the more viewers it loses. The last ever programme in the Monday slot, the acclaimed Who Bombed Omagh? fronted by John Ware, attracted 4.2m viewers, substantially more than last night's programme. The following week's special on child labour in third world factories run by big brands such as Nike and Gap pulled in 3.2m, a significant drop from the hard-hitting investigation into the worst ever IRA atrocity, but still head and shoulders above the reality show special. Could it be that audiences have finally had enough of Big Brother? Going up against a double-bill of Cold Feet was never going to be easy. The popular thirty-something saga attracted 8m and a 36% share at 9pm, while the English Patient on Channel 4 roped in 3.1m, 16% of share. Panorama did, however, beat Channel 5's Earthquake in New York, which got 2m viewers, 9% of share. In an otherwise uneventful weekend, Friday's Have I Got News For You (BBC1) suffered from the absence of Germaine Greer, who graced the programme with the presence the previous Friday.

      "bodyText": "Inspector Morse's creator, author Colin Dexter, today said he was astonished and disappointed that the adaptation of his final work was not premiered on ITV. \"I am extremely surprised. I know nothing about it being shown in Australia,\" he said. \"Everyone here felt Wednesday was the first showing. Carlton are obviously relaxed about it, but I don't think anybody else would have been happy about this. \"Most people would have felt that the first public showing of the last Morse should have taken place, as directed and commissioned by the ITV network, on ITV. When told that Carlton was justifying Australia's worldwide premiere by pointing out that Sydney was 14,000 miles away, Mr Dexter said: \"I suppose it is true that it won't spoil it for viewers here, but I don't know if any amount of distance can justify letting another country show it first.\" Mr Dexter, who decided to kill off Inspector Morse in his final book, The Remorseful Day, has enjoyed a close working relationship with ITV over the past 13 years. He wrote at total of 13 Morse books, all of which have been adapted for ITV.",

But the channel, which consistently comes second in the Australian ratings to Kerry Packer's Channel Nine, did not trumpet the showing of Morse as a world first. ITV, which kept the British date of the eagerly anticipated adaptation of Colin Dexter's final Morse novel under wraps for months, is running Inspector Morse's final two hours on Wednesday evening. Last night the pulling power of John Thaw, who plays the Oxford-based chief inspector, and his sidekick Lewis (Kevin Whately), was pitched against Samuel L Jackson and Kevin Spacey, as Channel Nine premiered The Negotiator. No ratings for the battle have been released yet. Inspector Morse's grouchy countenance is a familiar face to Australian viewers, to whom Morse has regularly been syndicated. The inspector even visited the country in one feature-length episode.

As are the illicit fishermen plucking sandy oysters out of the retreating tide, or the crusty town kids charged with rifling the dustbins at their local Intermarche. In younger, ruder hands, The Gleaners and I would surely have wound up a far more abrasive affair, touching as it does on the charged issue of direct action among a disenfranchised underclass. Except that Varda shies decorously away from obvious political conclusions. Instead, her line of inquiry is gentle, curious, her role more that of a browser than a director. The tack pays off in a film that is at once airily free-form and oddly profound. In shooting her documentary, Varda spent six months with France's modern-day gleaners; these millennial Wombles feeding from society's over-spill. She comes away with a digital scrapbook of beguiling social vignettes. That and a pair of high-backed chairs for her sitting room at home. \u0095 At the National Film Theatre, London SE1, today.

      "body": "<b>What is happening in the Hague?</b> <br> A massive international conference (its formal title is the 6th Conference of the Parties, or COP6) has begun. It aims to establish the ways in which the international community can combat climate change - and then hold them to their promises. <p><b>Haven't there been conferences before?</b><br> Yes - lots. This latest gathering is the culmination of a decade of international negotiations. In 1992 at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was opened for signature. This expressed concern about the effects of climate change (such as the movement of agricultural zones, the melting of polar ice caps and rising sea levels). And in 1997, governments established the Kyoto protocol, ratification of which would set up targets for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p><b>What are the targets?</b><br> Developed countries agreed to cut their collective greenhouse emissions by an average of 5.2% below 1990 levels over the years 2008-2012. Different countries adopted different targets: the EU committed to a cut of 8%, the US to 7% and Japan to 6%. Russia and the Ukraine agreed to stabilise at 1990 levels.</p> <p><b>So what is new about the Hague meeting?</b><br> It is a make-or-break gathering at which countries will accept or refuse the terms of the Kyoto protocol. In order for the protocol to come into practice, it must be ratified by 55 parties to the convention. Some of them must be developed industrial countries, which account for 55% of the carbon dioxide emissions.</p> <p><b>Why does this matter?</b><br> Because the world's climate appears to be changing. During the closing years of the last century, record temperatures and a run of extreme weather caused havoc around the world. Scientists at the UK meteorological office say that average temperatures have risen by about 0.6C since 1860 (when global records began). Six of the warmest years on record occurred during the 90s, with 1998 the warmest year since records began and 1999 not far behind.</p> <p><b>So what are the causes of climate change?</b><br> Some of the changes are probably part of the earth's natural climatic cycles, but most scientists agree that man has had a big impact. The intergovernmental panel on climate change says that rising temperatures are \"unlikely to be entirely natural in origin\".</p> <p><b>How does it occur?</b><br> Energy that comes from the sun in the form of short-wave radiation reaches the earth's surface undisturbed and warms it. Most of this energy is emitted back into space in the form of long-wave radiation, but some of this radiation is trapped in the atmosphere by a blanket of water vapour and trace gases called greenhouse gases. The main naturally occurring greenhouse gases are: water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N20). Additional greenhouse gases are created by industrial processes: they are artificial chemicals called halocarbons (CFCs, HFCs and PFCs) and long-lived gases such as sulphur hexafluoride (SF6). </p> <p><b>But how has man upset the process?</b><br> Plants and animals have exchanged carbon dioxide with the atmosphere in a carbon cycle that has remained in balance for the last 10,000 years. Since the industrial revolution, humans have disturbed this balance - by burning fossil fuels (such as oil, coal, and gas), by destroying forests, releasing stored carbon; and by agricultural practices such as the intensive rearing of cattle and high-scale plantation of rice (which produces methane). </p> <p><b>What's the evidence?</b><br> Carbon dioxide is the most important man-made greenhouse gas, accounting for about two-thirds of the human-derived greenhouse effect. Carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere have increased by about 30% in the last 200 years, from less than 280 parts per million (ppm) to 368 ppm today. The lobby group Friends of the Earth forecast that if we continue to burn fossil fuels at our current rate, atmospheric carbon dioxide will be at twice pre-industrial levels by 2030, and three times that figure by 2100.</p> <p><b>What are the effects of climate change?</b><br> One prediction suggests that if current trends persist, air temperatures could rise by 1-3.5C by 2100. Recent research published in the magazine Nature has suggested this rise could be more like 6C in the next century. As the world warms, the average sea level is expected to rise - by between 15cm and 95cm by 2100 relative to 1990 - as a result of thermal expansion of the oceans and melting of the glaciers and ice sheets. The 90s were not only the warmest decade of the 20th century, but also of the millennium. In addition to this trend of high temperatures, we can expect intense precipitation, long dry spells, frequent hurricanes and extremely high temperatures sometimes.</p> <p><b>What is the worst-case scenario?</b><br> The worst-case scenario forecast by scientists is the \"runaway greenhouse effect\" in which all the factors that cause global warming would eventually override the factors which work against it. Forests, for example, are thought to counter carbon dioxide emissions, because plants absorb carbon dioxide. So one of the suggested solutions to climate change is to plant vast forests. </p> <p>Recent research published in Nature, however, suggests that planting forests on areas which were formerly covered with ice would darken the earth's surface, making it absorb more of the sun's radiation. Further research from Nature suggests that forests will only absorb carbon up to a point, after which plants will become saturated, and will begin to emit it. </p> <p>There are also fears that if the Arctic tundra begins to melt, then organic matter stored in the ice will be oxidised. This could release huge amounts of carbon dioxide and methane. The melting of the Arctic ice cap would also reduce the amount of solar radiation the planet reflects, allowing more heat to be trapped.</p> <p><b>So will countries agree to the Kyoto protocol?</b><br> It is far from clear that they will. Many campaigning groups are concerned about a technical detail in the Kyoto protocol, which allows countries to offset their domestic emissions. In short, it allows a participant meeting its emissions reduction target to trade their surplus with another country. This could be by richer countries to avoid making significant cuts to their emissions. The Hague meeting will decide how much countries will be able to use these mechanisms to avoid actual cuts in domestic emissions. </p> <p><b>Who is involved in this?</b><br> The USA, Canada, Japan, New Zealand and Australia want to reduce the impact on their economies of the Kyoto agreement. They want most of their emissions targets to be fulfilled by these emissions-trading mechanisms. The EU has been keener to make real cuts in emissions. But many EU governments, including the UK, want the US to ratify the Kyoto agreement, so may be forced to make concessions. Meanwhile, the developing countries are divided on some issues and in agreement on others. The key forces are China and India. Saudi Arabia and other Opec countries are asking for compensation for lost revenues from the export of oil. </p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.unfccc.int/\" target=\"_new\">United Nations framework convention on climate change</a><br> <a href=\"http://cop6.unfccc.int/modules/none.asp?pageid=16\" target=\"_new\">COP6 website</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.cf.ac.uk/uwcc/earth/pace/\" target=\"_new\">Permafrost and climate in Europe (PACE)</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.law.pace.edu/env/energy/globalwarming.html\" target=\"_new\">Global warming central</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.rochesterenvironment.org/\" target=\"_new\">Center for environmental information</a><br></p>",

The former chief inspector of schools, Chris Woodhead, enraged academics last year when he suggested that much of the \u00a370m national education research effort was not worth funding. Researchers coordinating the programme have listed a number of areas in which they were unable to commission projects due to the lack of high-quality applications from academics.

The \u00a312.5m teaching and learning programme, commissioned by the Economic and Social Research Council, aims to support research that will improve the achievement of learners at all ages and stages of education. A review of UK educational research for the programme has revealed that \"expertise is widely and unevenly distributed.\" John Kanefsky, assistant director of the programme, said that some researchers lack the skills necessary to conduct large-scale, quantitative research and experimental studies. The teaching and learning programme aims to improve research capacity in the area with a series of training and networking programmes. Nine major research projects were launched at a conference last week.

      "body": "<p>Journalists are not used to taking up cudgels for copyright. But now a number of recent high-profile disputes over the issue have begun to make many of them sit up and start fighting for their rights on the web. </p> <p>Last month, leading online journal <a href=\"http://www.Salon.com\">Salon.com</a> sent out contracts to its freelance writers. For most, this was the first contract the publication had ever sent them. The contracts asked the writers to give up resale rights to their published work in exchange for 25% of the resale fee. </p> <p>Salon managing editor Scott Rosenberg told the Village Voice the contracts were an \"honest attempt to secure resale rights individually - we make no claims to have the rights until a writer signs - and to compensate writers for those rights.\" </p> <p>Not true, say a number of writers, including San Francisco-based Sam Witt and Sean Durkin and Media-week (US) columnist Catherine Seipp, who claim Salon is selling work on which they still own copyright. And what's more, with Salon's stock dropping below $1 (70p), many US pundits saw the contracts as nothing more than a transparent rights grab. </p> <p>The dispute followed a number of high-profile cases in the US and UK over freelance rights. Steve Brill, the self-appointed watchdog of the US media and one-time editor of Brill's Content, got into trouble when he launched his massive e-publishers, <a href=\"http://www.Contentville.com\">Contentville.com</a> in June. He angered hundreds of writers when he began selling work on which they held copyright direct to the public without their consent. </p> <p>Then, in September, the Authors Guild, the largest advocacy and trade group representing writers in the US, filed a lawsuit in New York against five corporations - including Dow Jones Interactive, Reuters and Reed Elsevier - accusing them of years of systematic copyright infringement of thousands of freelance writers' articles. And next month the National Writers Union will appeal to the Supreme Court in a case against the New York Times. </p> <p>Back in the UK, Serena Mackesy, a former contributor to the Independent and best-selling author of The Temp, found sections of her novel for sale on US search engine Northern Light. Mackesy had originally written The Temp as a column in the Independent. She retained copyright and went on to sell it as a novel to Random House.

Last month, David Wallis, seven years a contributor to the New York Times (and incidentally one of Steve Brill's most vocal critics) launched <a href=\"http://www.Featurewell.com\">Featurewell.com</a>. The site is an electronic marketplace that enables editors to read and then purchase the rights to publish articles by what it claims are the world's finest journalists. The site is effectively an online agency for writers. There is no subscription fee, editors pay for the rights to publish stories on an \u00e0 la carte basis. </p> <p>Wallis, who has written for most of the UK broadsheets, says he got the idea for Featurewell after managing to be the only print journalist to interview Manuel Noriega while he was in prison in 1998. Wallis sold the same article 21 times and made more than $20,000. </p> <p>\"As the internet took hold, I noticed how contracts that I and other writers would receive had become more stringent,\" says Wallis. \"I thought we could turn the tables and efficiently market our work and maybe also motivate writers to cross out clauses in their contracts.\" </p> <p>Traditionally, the rights to the article revert back to the writer after a gap of between one and 90 days. The paper or magazine can work directly on reselling the writer's work and, if successful, the writer will, more than likely, receive 50% of \"spot sales\". However, most publications work through a third party - the large syndication houses. Then the third party takes 50% and the remainder is split evenly between the writer and the publication, leaving the writer with 25% of the sale. </p> <p>Featurewell is offering writers 60% of resale and the writer retains copyright on all material sold. Of the 40% that is left, Wallis claims to split this with the publication in which the piece first appeared. This, says Wallis, gives Featurewell the cachet of being associated with top publications and clean copy that requires no further editing. </p> <p>\"First of all I believe it is good business to treat writers well and fairly and I think if it is left to corporations to decide, then the writer will always be the one to get the short end of the stick,\" argues Wallis. \"So I thought it would be good business and politically satisfying to start a company that paid more to writers and allowed editors to shop around.\" </p> <p>Wallis insists that there is a market out there - and cites his own career as a prime example. \"I've probably earned a third of my living over the past few years solely on foreign sales of pieces I've already written,\" he says. He claims he makes $60,000 a year on average. His list of writers is impressive: Pulitzer Prize winner Justin Kaplan, Claudia Dreifus of the New York Times and a number of expatriate Brits, namely Alex Kershaw of the New York Times and the freelancer Tessa Souter. Now Wallis wants to appeal to UK writers and editors, too, and has signed a deal with British translation company Pretorious to offer foreign language editions. And soon he hopes to offer original content as well. </p> <p>In the first month of operation, Featurewell has sold more than $5,000 worth of articles - about a dozen pieces. Not much, but Wallis says that this was all through word of mouth, and calls it \"a really encouraging start\". But will there be a market? After all, if so many writers are being asked to sign away their electronic rights (or have already done so), who will be left to write for Featurewell? Wallis says that we are beginning to see a backlash against stringent contracts. \"The more publications try to issue these contracts, the more [writers] will rebel, the more content I will be able to get my hands on.\" </p> <p>Last but not least is the issue of money. \"Writers are remarkable,\" he says. \"On the one hand they are some of the most literate people in the world, but on the other they barely read their contracts.

      "bodyText": "Journalists are not used to taking up cudgels for copyright. But now a number of recent high-profile disputes over the issue have begun to make many of them sit up and start fighting for their rights on the web. Last month, leading online journal Salon.com sent out contracts to its freelance writers. For most, this was the first contract the publication had ever sent them. The contracts asked the writers to give up resale rights to their published work in exchange for 25% of the resale fee. Salon managing editor Scott Rosenberg told the Village Voice the contracts were an \"honest attempt to secure resale rights individually - we make no claims to have the rights until a writer signs - and to compensate writers for those rights.\" Not true, say a number of writers, including San Francisco-based Sam Witt and Sean Durkin and Media-week (US) columnist Catherine Seipp, who claim Salon is selling work on which they still own copyright. And what's more, with Salon's stock dropping below $1 (70p), many US pundits saw the contracts as nothing more than a transparent rights grab. The dispute followed a number of high-profile cases in the US and UK over freelance rights. Steve Brill, the self-appointed watchdog of the US media and one-time editor of Brill's Content, got into trouble when he launched his massive e-publishers, Contentville.com in June. He angered hundreds of writers when he began selling work on which they held copyright direct to the public without their consent. Then, in September, the Authors Guild, the largest advocacy and trade group representing writers in the US, filed a lawsuit in New York against five corporations - including Dow Jones Interactive, Reuters and Reed Elsevier - accusing them of years of systematic copyright infringement of thousands of freelance writers' articles. And next month the National Writers Union will appeal to the Supreme Court in a case against the New York Times. Back in the UK, Serena Mackesy, a former contributor to the Independent and best-selling author of The Temp, found sections of her novel for sale on US search engine Northern Light. Mackesy had originally written The Temp as a column in the Independent. She retained copyright and went on to sell it as a novel to Random House.

I will give him the benefit of the doubt on this occasion, after all few things are more boring than cheering on no goals in a live game.

      "bodyText": "Current totals (from their initial \u00a3100 kitties):, Scott Murray = \u00a3165.21, Sean Ingle = \u00a3108.86, Paul MacInnes = \u00a356.46, Football Unlimited punters collective = \u00a347.77 Scott Murray: Preston v Crewe: no goalscorer \u00a35 @ 10/1. Bet lost. Can it really be true? A Scott Murray speculative 10/1 punt doesn't come off! Has the world gone mad? I'm so used to congratulating Mr M on landing yet another long-odds winner I really don't know what to say when faced with failure. One good thing, at least, is that Scott is now backing no goalscorer rather than no goals. I seem to remember that wasn't the case a few weeks ago so at least I have achieved something in the brief time allowed to me to warp young minds. What is slightly worrying though is the frequency with which Mr M seems to choose live games to bet on. I will give him the benefit of the doubt on this occasion, after all few things are more boring than cheering on no goals in a live game. But it is all too easy to fall into the trap of having an 'interest bet', giving yourself a financial interest to spice up what might otherwise be a fairly uninteresting game. Does anyone out there recognise themselves in that description? Of course most of us do it, and I'm not saying there is no place in life for interest bets - far from it in fact, betting should be fun. But if you want to be a disciplined and winning gambler then these types of bets must be avoided. But enough, this is doubtless a mere hiccup in the unstoppable march towards the \u00a3200 mark by the inestimable Mr M. He's done nothing wrong, but one can't expect every 10/1 shot to come off. Sean Ingle: \u00a35 double: Bradford v Everton 0 or 1 Goals @ 2/1 and Valladolid to draw with Alaves @ 2/1. Bet lost. He is the bane of my life is Mr Ingle. Well maybe not THE bane, I reckon that title can safely go to my forever-nearly-finished-but-never-actually-finished PhD, but he certainly qualifies as a bane. And he knows it. And he does it on purpose I'm sure. This week's Ingle bet is, predictably enough, another two fingers up to all I hold dear. A double consisting of 0 or 1 goals and a draw, three offences for the price of one. Now that is value.

Laith Amiry, who writes for Weekend Football, a betting prediction site: \u00a310 treble -Ipswich to beat Charlton @ evens, Sunderland to beat Southampton @ 4/7, and Chelsea to beat Leeds @ 4/5.

      "body": "<p>Collection tins and sponsored events may be the public face of charity fundraising, but a huge variety of skills and experiences lie behind this \u00a313bn-a-year industry. Today's charity fundraisers are as likely to deal with blue-chip companies as with blue-rinse charity-shop volunteers. The results can be hugely rewarding, both in terms of meeting financial targets and in working for a good cause.</p> <p>Charities raise funds from a number of sources. Donations from the public usually account for a large proportion of income, while other sources include grants from trusts or foundations, National Lottery funding and donations from companies. Most charities now rely on a range of fundraising techniques to bring in the cash. These include direct mail, events, face-to-face dialogue and, more recently, internet fundraising. </p> <p>Fundraisers fall into two categories - specialists and generalists. A large charity will usually have fundraisers who specialise in a different technique. A small charity will employ fewer fundraisers, but will choose people with more general experience.</p> <p>Salaries now rival those in the commercial sector, although regional charities may not be able to match their London equivalents. A fundraising assistant can expect to earn at least \u00a315,000; a director of fundraising or marketing can command around \u00a350,000, and as much as \u00a370,000 in some cases. According to Charity Rewards, an annual survey of salaries in the charity sector, fundraisers are becoming increasingly scarce as demand for them rises in line with charities' desire to diversify and increase their income. </p> <p>There is no single way of becoming a charity fundraiser. A graduate with experience of organising events at college could join a charity as an events co-ordinator. A marketing director in the commercial sector could make the switch to the voluntary sector as a director of fundraising.</p> <p>Ideally, you will have some experience of marketing, public relations or promotions work. A fundraiser's tasks will depend on the charity and field, but could include presenting sponsorship proposals to corporate donors, designing fundraising initiatives for schools or employee groups, liaising with regional fundraisers, and completing grant application forms. \"There are opportunities at almost every level and multiple routes to getting in,\" says Janet Cummins, chief executive of specialist recruitment company Charity and Fundraising Appointments.</p> <p>Nine years ago, Jane Harris was working in public relations for a holiday tour operator, taking travel agents around Spain. Today, she's the corporate support manager for YHA, the hostels and education charity, with responsibility for building relationships with the business sector. After leaving PR, Harris spent seven months volunteering for the Samaritans and also helped with street collections for a local disability charity. This experience led to her first charity-sector job, as fundraising assistant at Victim Support. \"I think that they were quite impressed that I had volunteered, as it showed I was interested in the sector,\" she says. </p> <p>As well as interest and commitment, a potential fundraiser should also demonstrate persistence and powers of persuasion. \"You get an awful lot of 'no's' on the way to the 'yes's',\" says Cummins. \"The ability to think creatively and laterally is also important, as are good interpersonal skills.\"</p> <p>Cummins stresses that professional development is essential once you're in post. \"Fundraising is not just about local people running coffee mornings. You need to know about the law, managing volunteers and working with trustees.\" For those with little or no fundraising training, there are courses available to suit different needs, times and budgets. Providers include the Institute of Charity Fundraising Managers, the Open University and the Directory of Social Change. </p> <p>Ian Ventham, head of fundraising and marketing at the Royal National Lifeboat Institute, says the sector has grown up over the last 15 years. \"Fundraising has become more sophisticated and fundraisers more professional,\" he says. Ventham, whose experience includes stints at Help the Aged and the NSPCC, adds that demands on fundraisers are constantly changing. \"Different donors have different needs, at different stages of their lives. The fundraiser's job is to understand and meet those needs.\"</p> <p><strong>Case study<br> Liz Monks, 31 - deputy director, Shelter</strong><br> \"My background is in marketing. I worked for five years for a small financial services company, handling their trade PR and business-to-business work. I was volunteering at the Terence Higgins Trust (THT) at the time, and started to look at jobs going there because I really believed in what they were doing.</p> <p>\"In 1995, a job came up as corporate and community fundraiser, which I applied for and got. The job involved organising all the charity's big events, so it was very good experience. After three years, I wanted another challenge. You think you go into charity fundraising selflessly but, in reality, you continue to want challenges. So, in 1998, I took a job as head of corporate and community fundraising at the Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID). It was completely different to THT - it was a 90-year-old charity and the cause was not perceived as sexy in fundraising terms. I found my commercial experience quite valuable there and RNID was made charity of the year by several companies, including WH Smith and Virgin. </p> <p>\"In July this year, I came to work at Shelter as deputy director of fundraising. It's a very interesting cause and, to be honest, you have to believe in it. When you're in front of funders, you have to be able to feel passionate about what you're pitching to them. Another reason for coming here was to work with my old boss from RNID, as we complement each other's skills very well. </p> <p>\"When I first came into the sector, I took a huge pay cut but I'm now probably earning what I would if I'd stayed in the commercial sector. You can achieve things at quite a young age in this sector and it's a seller's market right now. Fundraising gives you the ability to change people's lives. How often can you say that about the business sector?\"</p> <p><strong>Five tips for fundraisers</strong><br> \u0095 If you're currently working in the commercial sector, become a volunteer. \"Think of a cause close to your heart and offer your services,\" says Cummins. \"Even if it's not on the fundraising side, it will be valuable experience and will help you to understand the charity sector's culture.\"<br> \u0095 Know your strengths - and your weaknesses. If you don't like juggling too many balls, specialise in one area of fundraising. If you enjoy the challenge, pick a job that requires general experience. <br> \u0095 Don't be afraid to ask for advice and support. In many organisations, you may be the only person doing that job, so it's important to meet other fundraisers and discuss ideas.<br> \u0095 Keep learning. \"Fundraising is a wide and complicated subject. Different areas require different knowledge,\" says Cummins.<br> \u0095 Network, network, network. \"Fundraising is all about friend-raising,\" says Cummins. \"You have to build and maintain relationships.\"</p>",

After leaving PR, Harris spent seven months volunteering for the Samaritans and also helped with street collections for a local disability charity. This experience led to her first charity-sector job, as fundraising assistant at Victim Support. \"I think that they were quite impressed that I had volunteered, as it showed I was interested in the sector,\" she says. As well as interest and commitment, a potential fundraiser should also demonstrate persistence and powers of persuasion. \"You get an awful lot of 'no's' on the way to the 'yes's',\" says Cummins. \"The ability to think creatively and laterally is also important, as are good interpersonal skills.\" Cummins stresses that professional development is essential once you're in post. \"Fundraising is not just about local people running coffee mornings. You need to know about the law, managing volunteers and working with trustees.\" For those with little or no fundraising training, there are courses available to suit different needs, times and budgets. Providers include the Institute of Charity Fundraising Managers, the Open University and the Directory of Social Change. Ian Ventham, head of fundraising and marketing at the Royal National Lifeboat Institute, says the sector has grown up over the last 15 years. \"Fundraising has become more sophisticated and fundraisers more professional,\" he says. Ventham, whose experience includes stints at Help the Aged and the NSPCC, adds that demands on fundraisers are constantly changing. \"Different donors have different needs, at different stages of their lives. The fundraiser's job is to understand and meet those needs.\" Case study Liz Monks, 31 - deputy director, Shelter \"My background is in marketing. I worked for five years for a small financial services company, handling their trade PR and business-to-business work. I was volunteering at the Terence Higgins Trust (THT) at the time, and started to look at jobs going there because I really believed in what they were doing. \"In 1995, a job came up as corporate and community fundraiser, which I applied for and got. The job involved organising all the charity's big events, so it was very good experience. After three years, I wanted another challenge. You think you go into charity fundraising selflessly but, in reality, you continue to want challenges. So, in 1998, I took a job as head of corporate and community fundraising at the Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID). It was completely different to THT - it was a 90-year-old charity and the cause was not perceived as sexy in fundraising terms. I found my commercial experience quite valuable there and RNID was made charity of the year by several companies, including WH Smith and Virgin. \"In July this year, I came to work at Shelter as deputy director of fundraising. It's a very interesting cause and, to be honest, you have to believe in it. When you're in front of funders, you have to be able to feel passionate about what you're pitching to them. Another reason for coming here was to work with my old boss from RNID, as we complement each other's skills very well. \"When I first came into the sector, I took a huge pay cut but I'm now probably earning what I would if I'd stayed in the commercial sector. You can achieve things at quite a young age in this sector and it's a seller's market right now. Fundraising gives you the ability to change people's lives. How often can you say that about the business sector?\" Five tips for fundraisers \u0095 If you're currently working in the commercial sector, become a volunteer. \"Think of a cause close to your heart and offer your services,\" says Cummins. \"Even if it's not on the fundraising side, it will be valuable experience and will help you to understand the charity sector's culture.\" \u0095 Know your strengths - and your weaknesses. If you don't like juggling too many balls, specialise in one area of fundraising. If you enjoy the challenge, pick a job that requires general experience. \u0095 Don't be afraid to ask for advice and support. In many organisations, you may be the only person doing that job, so it's important to meet other fundraisers and discuss ideas. \u0095 Keep learning. \"Fundraising is a wide and complicated subject. Different areas require different knowledge,\" says Cummins. \u0095 Network, network, network. \"Fundraising is all about friend-raising,\" says Cummins. \"You have to build and maintain relationships.\"",

      "body": "<p>The sort of Europe I want to see in 2010 is a Europe with which everyone in this country can be comfortable. A wider Europe. A prosperous Europe. A safer Europe. A stable Europe. And a strong Europe.</p> <p>A wider Europe because by 2010 we shall be well on the way to reuniting Europe. With up to a dozen new member states, the EU will have become the whole of the Continent, from the Arctic to the Mediterranean and from the Black Sea to the Atlantic. The Eurosceptics should reflect on why they want us to get off the bus when so many are queuing to get on.</p> <p>And the British people need a prosperous Europe. We are already part of the world\u00d5s biggest Single Market. Three million British jobs now depend on our trade with the rest of the EU. One million jobs have been created in this country since we joined the Social Chapter in 1997. By 2010 we want more. The economic reform agenda which we developed at Lisbon will turn the EU into the world\u00d5s leading knowledge-based economy. We can meet this objective, and create more jobs, by modernising and renewing the European social model which has always valued labour as a resource worth investing in, not just as a factor of production. Higher growth, greater prosperity and more jobs throughout Europe are all in Britain\u00d5s national interest.</p> <p>I am not going to give the journalists their headlines for tomorrow morning by saying now whether I think Britain will be part of the Euro by then. It is astonishing how many acres of newsprint ministers can receive on the Euro by stating the obvious. Our policy is well-known, and we will continue to make the case for British membership. So let me put it this way: If the Euro is successful, if the economic tests have been met following our assessment early in the next Parliament, we will recommend entry to the British people in a referendum. And if the economic case is strong, I believe the British people will support entry.</p> <p>A safer Europe because that is the best way to build a safer Britain. In 2010 I want a Britain safer from cross-border criminals, terrorists, drug dealers and people traffickers. Crime knows no boundaries and the fight against crime should know no boundaries. That is why we are already working with our neighbours in the EU to make Europe an area of freedom, security and justice. The more countries of Europe join the EU, the safer we will be. British people want to know that there is no hiding place for criminals or the proceeds of their crimes anywhere in Europe.</p> <p>And I want to see a Europe of strength in the world. It is a delusion to imagine that Britain is stronger if it is isolated. The best way to project British values and British interests is by doing so in partnership with those who share our values: democracy, human rights, justice and freedom.</p> <p>The British people gain because Britain and the rest of Europe speak with a single voice in international negotiations on trade and the environment. In the WTO, Britain on its own would be a significant influence, but our message and interests might be drowned out among competing European voices. By pooling our interests with those of our European partners, we are transformed into one of the two key actors in global trade negotiations. The same is true in the environment, where the EU is a model for the world of how to combine prosperity and opportunity with a healthy environment, and, because of that, an increasingly powerful voice in global environmental debates. Britain\u00d5s voice will be heard more clearly in the world because our interests are backed by a Union of 15 or 25 countries which share our outlook.</p> <p>And each of these countries will be a member of a Europe of stability. The European Security Initiative reinforces our ability to respond to crises where NATO is not engaged. By 2010 we could see a joint EU operation bringing order in place of instability, safeguarding Britain\u00d5s national interests and enhancing respect for Britain\u00d5s military skills.</p> <p>This prospect of Europe in 2010 is an exciting vision. And Britain will reap the full benefits \u00d0 security, prosperity and strength. Which makes it hard to fathom why so much of the discussion about Europe here \u00d0 whether in the media, Parliament or political debates around the country \u00d0 is dominated by fear and anxiety, not excitement.</p> <p>What sort of EU do parts of the British media foresee in 2010? An EU in which jackbooted Eurocops roam the streets of Britain, arresting anyone eating bent bananas or drinking beer in pints. A Europe where lollipop ladies are harmonised, where darts are banned from British pubs and where rubber ducks are banned from the great British bathtub. All of which, and more, have passed recently through the pages of our press.</p> <p>Euromyths provide great fun for journalists. The media has a mission to entertain. And some of them rise magnificently to that goal. But they are failing in their other mission \u00d0 to inform. That is the conclusion we must draw from a recent Eurobarometer survey which showed that just two per cent of the British people believe what they hear about Europe in the media. Those of us who want the public to have a proper understanding of the benefits we derive from our membership of the EU have a strong interest in turning the tide of EU reporting. From now on the Government will be rebutting all such stories vigorously and promptly. You will be hearing the catchphrase \u00d4Facts, not Myths\u00d5, until that is the way the EU is reported.</p> <p>Turning the tide of the national debate about Europe is about more than correcting error. We need to develop a positive storyline about Europe. This is not something the Government can or should be doing on its own. There are many national publications, and many journalists working for them, who do not share the ideological Euroscepticism of the Daily Mail. But, with the exception of the Financial Times, no newspaper in this country has a consistently objective narrative about Europe.</p> <p>The biggest Euromyth of all is the myth of the superstate. There will not be a superstate because the British people would never allow it. And neither would the French people, the German people, the Italian people or the people of Poland, Hungary, Latvia or the other countries now queuing up to join the EU because they know it will make them stronger.</p> <p>Last week Romano Prodi made an important speech in this country, in which he exploded the myth of the European superstate, and stressed the primacy of national identities in Europe. He praised what Tony Blair had said about the future of Europe last month in Warsaw. But how was he reported the following morning? \u00d4Britain rejected calls yesterday from Romano Prodi to abandon its veto on key areas of policy.\u00d5</p> <p>Note how this opening line presents President Prodi\u00d5s speech, in which he agreed with the British Prime Minister, as a challenge to the Prime Minister. Note how Britain is being portrayed on the defensive \u00d0 rejecting pressure on it from Europe. Note how it is assumed that any reduction in unanimous decision making is a threat to the British national interest. And note also that this intro is not culled from the Daily Mail, where it belongs, but from The Guardian.</p> <p>How can we hope to convince the public of the case for Europe, if even those papers who profess to support Europe, consistently present it to their readers as a threat?</p> <p>We need the sensible, mainstream press to stop dancing to the Eurosceptic tune. The pro-European papers should be saying why they believe our place is in Europe, not why others believe our place is outside. Those who believe Britain\u00d5s interests are best served by strengthening our influence in Europe should come out of the closet. They have nothing to be ashamed of. Pro-Europeanism is a respectable cause. It has a distinguished history in British political thought, and contains a more reasoned vision of the future than the isolationism which would betray our national interests.</p> <p>It is patriotism, it is national self-interest, to argue for Britain\u00d5s full engagement as a leading partner in Europe. It is a betrayal of our nation and our future constantly to obstruct every fresh opportunity for cooperation in Europe. On Thursday, I shall be expanding the long-term positive case for engagement in Europe and the British principles which underpin it. But before we get to the horizon we must first traverse the foreground. Today I want to present the good news story that an objective press should be preparing to report from Nice next month.</p> <p>Many of them are already tipping their pens with doom and fear. But we should be looking forward to Nice with positive anticipation. It is the next important step towards building the sort of Europe we want to see by 2010.</p> <p>The Nice Summit is good news because it will produce two things Britain supports: Reform and Enlargement. Nice is about clearing the way for the accession of the first new member states. It is about reuniting Europe and releasing the benefits of prosperity, stability and strength for Europe\u00d5s new democracies in the East. But admitting them to the EU is not just an exercise in altruism. Britain is a champion of EU enlargement also because of a hard-headed calculation of the benefits it will bring to the British people. More allies in the fight against our joint enemies \u00d0 cross-border crime, pollution, drugs, poverty and unemployment. More jobs because our companies will be operating in a domestic Single Market of half a billion consumers. More clout in an increasingly multilateral and globalised world because a whole continent will be batting for our interests.</p> <p>The Nice Summit is good news because it will reinforce the place of human rights in our political culture. The Charter of Rights will be a political declaration, not a binding document. It will set down, for the first time in one place, the rights to which the EU\u00d5s residents are already entitled. The political rights enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights, and the economic and social rights contained in the EU Treaties and the member states\u00d5 own national laws and practices.</p> <p>The Eurosceptics don\u00d5t like the Charter. What is it they so dislike? The Charter will help people know their rights. Who could object to that? It will guide the EU institutions on what they need to do to respect those rights. Surely that can\u00d5t be the problem. It won\u00d5t damage business \u00d0 the CBI have welcomed it. Nor will it become legally binding unless we agree. I can only conclude that those who dislike the Charter dislike the rights within it \u00d0 the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty, the right to dignity, the right to freedom of expression. Only in the perverse logic of Euroscepticism could rights be considered a threat to Britain and the interests of the British people.</p> <p>The Nice Summit is good news because it will make Britain stronger. Our negotiating objective is to get more votes in the Council of Ministers and increase our relative weight for the first time since we joined in 1973. Nice will make sure Britain\u00d5s influence is felt still more strongly in a wider Europe.</p> <p>The Nice Summit is good news because it means we can go on building an EU which works for us. Some in Britain think we should have a veto on everything. But they forget that if we have a veto, so does everyone else. I don\u00d5t want everyone to have a veto on our initiatives. In the last two years there were 85 votes on QMV in the Council. Britain was outvoted just five times. We have been rather successful in making majority voting work for Britain\u00d5s interests.</p> <p>That means there were 80 occasions when other countries could have used a veto to stop outcomes we wanted. Measures like the e-commerce rule which several countries opposed but which we got through in the interests of British business. Or the right of British chocolate makers to sell their products throughout the EU. And a ban on driftnets which has saved countless dolphins and turtles from death was passed under our Presidency despite opposition from three other countries.</p> <p>We are supporting more QMV at Nice where it will make the EU work better in our interests. We don\u00d5t want countries to be able to veto improvements to the way the European Court of Justice speeds up its work, or to veto much-needed reforms to streamline the Commission\u00d5s accounting procedures. But we will retain consensus in areas which are essential to our national identity like tax, social security, border controls, defence or treaty amendment.</p> <p>That does not mean Nice is the last word on the EU\u00d5s institutional shape. There is still a democratic deficit in the institutions. Paradoxically, this is partly because of the very strength and vigour of the national democracies which make up the EU. The parliaments and governments of the nation states are where the will of the people finds its most expressive voice. If we want to find ways of making sure that Europe\u00d5s priorities in 2010 are the people\u00d5s priorities, we can do so by leveraging the strength of Europe\u00d5s national democracies for our collective interests.</p> <p>Tony Blair, in his speech last month in Warsaw, floated some ways of doing this. Representatives of national parliaments could sit in a second chamber of the European Parliament. This chamber would harness the strength of Europe\u00d5s national democracies. It would not legislate, but preserve the balance between what the Union does and what the member states do.</p> <p>Britain has always been an outward-looking nation. It would be extraordinary if we were now to allow isolationists to throw the opportunity of Europe away. I want to re-cast the debate about Europe in this country. A debate based on facts, not myths. I want to bury the myth of a superstate \u00d0 national identities are too strong. I want to bury the myth that Brussels is Them. Brussels is us.</p> <p>I want to bury the myth that Britain can only win when Europe loses, or vice versa. In the EU we can all be winners.</p> <p>It is a delusion of the Eurosceptics that a stronger Europe necessarily means a weaker Britain. On the contrary the stronger Europe is in the world the stronger will be Britain. A weak Europe means a weak Britain.</p> <p>Where Britain will be in 2010 depends on who wins the debate on Europe today. If the debate is won by the Eurosceptics, 2010 will find Britain isolated and weaker. A Britain at best marginalised in the key decisions of its neighbours. A Britain at worst outside the biggest trading bloc in the world.</p> <p>If the debate is won by those who believe in Britain in Europe, 2010 will find a more confident Britain. A Britain playing a leading part in the world\u00d5s largest union of nation states, delivering the economic opportunity, the clean environment, the safe streets, and the regional peace that the British people want.</p> <p>Those are the alternative futures for Britain that hang on the present European debate. I know which future I want for Britain. And I know that many in the press want that future too. It is time that all of us who share that vision of our future made sure that the British people can hear the positive reasons why they should choose a stronger Britain in a wider Europe.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The sort of Europe I want to see in 2010 is a Europe with which everyone in this country can be comfortable. A wider Europe. A prosperous Europe. A safer Europe. A stable Europe. And a strong Europe. A wider Europe because by 2010 we shall be well on the way to reuniting Europe. With up to a dozen new member states, the EU will have become the whole of the Continent, from the Arctic to the Mediterranean and from the Black Sea to the Atlantic. The Eurosceptics should reflect on why they want us to get off the bus when so many are queuing to get on. And the British people need a prosperous Europe. We are already part of the world\u00d5s biggest Single Market. Three million British jobs now depend on our trade with the rest of the EU. One million jobs have been created in this country since we joined the Social Chapter in 1997. By 2010 we want more. The economic reform agenda which we developed at Lisbon will turn the EU into the world\u00d5s leading knowledge-based economy. We can meet this objective, and create more jobs, by modernising and renewing the European social model which has always valued labour as a resource worth investing in, not just as a factor of production. Higher growth, greater prosperity and more jobs throughout Europe are all in Britain\u00d5s national interest. I am not going to give the journalists their headlines for tomorrow morning by saying now whether I think Britain will be part of the Euro by then. It is astonishing how many acres of newsprint ministers can receive on the Euro by stating the obvious. Our policy is well-known, and we will continue to make the case for British membership. So let me put it this way: If the Euro is successful, if the economic tests have been met following our assessment early in the next Parliament, we will recommend entry to the British people in a referendum. And if the economic case is strong, I believe the British people will support entry. A safer Europe because that is the best way to build a safer Britain. In 2010 I want a Britain safer from cross-border criminals, terrorists, drug dealers and people traffickers. Crime knows no boundaries and the fight against crime should know no boundaries. That is why we are already working with our neighbours in the EU to make Europe an area of freedom, security and justice. The more countries of Europe join the EU, the safer we will be. British people want to know that there is no hiding place for criminals or the proceeds of their crimes anywhere in Europe. And I want to see a Europe of strength in the world. It is a delusion to imagine that Britain is stronger if it is isolated. The best way to project British values and British interests is by doing so in partnership with those who share our values: democracy, human rights, justice and freedom. The British people gain because Britain and the rest of Europe speak with a single voice in international negotiations on trade and the environment. In the WTO, Britain on its own would be a significant influence, but our message and interests might be drowned out among competing European voices. By pooling our interests with those of our European partners, we are transformed into one of the two key actors in global trade negotiations. The same is true in the environment, where the EU is a model for the world of how to combine prosperity and opportunity with a healthy environment, and, because of that, an increasingly powerful voice in global environmental debates. Britain\u00d5s voice will be heard more clearly in the world because our interests are backed by a Union of 15 or 25 countries which share our outlook. And each of these countries will be a member of a Europe of stability. The European Security Initiative reinforces our ability to respond to crises where NATO is not engaged. By 2010 we could see a joint EU operation bringing order in place of instability, safeguarding Britain\u00d5s national interests and enhancing respect for Britain\u00d5s military skills. This prospect of Europe in 2010 is an exciting vision. And Britain will reap the full benefits \u00d0 security, prosperity and strength. Which makes it hard to fathom why so much of the discussion about Europe here \u00d0 whether in the media, Parliament or political debates around the country \u00d0 is dominated by fear and anxiety, not excitement. What sort of EU do parts of the British media foresee in 2010? An EU in which jackbooted Eurocops roam the streets of Britain, arresting anyone eating bent bananas or drinking beer in pints. A Europe where lollipop ladies are harmonised, where darts are banned from British pubs and where rubber ducks are banned from the great British bathtub. All of which, and more, have passed recently through the pages of our press. Euromyths provide great fun for journalists. The media has a mission to entertain. And some of them rise magnificently to that goal. But they are failing in their other mission \u00d0 to inform. That is the conclusion we must draw from a recent Eurobarometer survey which showed that just two per cent of the British people believe what they hear about Europe in the media. Those of us who want the public to have a proper understanding of the benefits we derive from our membership of the EU have a strong interest in turning the tide of EU reporting. From now on the Government will be rebutting all such stories vigorously and promptly. You will be hearing the catchphrase \u00d4Facts, not Myths\u00d5, until that is the way the EU is reported. Turning the tide of the national debate about Europe is about more than correcting error. We need to develop a positive storyline about Europe. This is not something the Government can or should be doing on its own. There are many national publications, and many journalists working for them, who do not share the ideological Euroscepticism of the Daily Mail. But, with the exception of the Financial Times, no newspaper in this country has a consistently objective narrative about Europe. The biggest Euromyth of all is the myth of the superstate. There will not be a superstate because the British people would never allow it. And neither would the French people, the German people, the Italian people or the people of Poland, Hungary, Latvia or the other countries now queuing up to join the EU because they know it will make them stronger. Last week Romano Prodi made an important speech in this country, in which he exploded the myth of the European superstate, and stressed the primacy of national identities in Europe. He praised what Tony Blair had said about the future of Europe last month in Warsaw. But how was he reported the following morning? \u00d4Britain rejected calls yesterday from Romano Prodi to abandon its veto on key areas of policy.\u00d5 Note how this opening line presents President Prodi\u00d5s speech, in which he agreed with the British Prime Minister, as a challenge to the Prime Minister.

The station, which has been running for 11 years, has tried to win contracts with ITV in the past but was not deemed a suitable supplier by TV watchdog the Independent Television Commission. Sky is still regarded an unsuitable bidder, but Mr Pollard is pressing ahead in the hope he can win status as an official ITC \"nominated news supplier\". At the moment it is disqualified from bidding because Rupert Murdoch's stake in the company is too big. However Sky bosses are said to be in talks about a joint venture, possibly with Scottish and Ulster TV and Channel TV on the Channel Islands. Sources say last week's talks were with ITV news controller Steve Anderson and commercial director John Hardie. \"Sky would not go this far, if they didn't think there was a way forward. They are trying to find a way around the brick wall, rather than rush headlong into it,\" said one source. Earlier this summer Mr Pollard wrote to the ITC seeking approval as a \"nominated news provider\", a prerequisite to pitch for the ITV news contract. Today the ITC said it had written to Sky reiterating the fact that it was barred from being an ITV supplier because of Rupert Murdoch's dominant share in the company. Under the rules, shareholdings in the company supplying ITV with its news must be limited to 20%. Mr Murdoch owns 37.5% of Sky, automatically disqualifying the station from supplying ITV. This legal snag would be removed if Sky set up a joint venture with another company.",

And even more interesting for Mr Mosey and BBC director general Greg Dyke - what audience it could have had if the Nine O'Clock News had remained intact? Mr Mosey also dismisses the argument that the Nine O'Clock News would be getting big audiences if it still existed.

In the longer term, Mr Anderson says ITV remains committed to the news scheduling deal agreed with the ITC in September, while continuing to run peak-time news specials when big stories break. But he believes the events of the past fortnight show that the BBC's strategy for moving its news is \"coming apart on every level\". \"They said they were moving from nine to 10pm to get bigger news audiences - we've demonstrated that there are far more people watching news at nine.\" The official BBC line is that the 10pm news move will be assessed as part of the annual BBC1 performance review, published in the annual report next summer.

The most popular items were holidays, books, computer games and music, said the survey, produced by global information company Experian, which questioned more than 500,000 internet users. The research showed that online shoppers were mainly young and wealthy. It said that 37% of internet shoppers surveyed said they did not consider the worldwide web to be a valuable educational resource.

      "bodyText": "One of the industry's most distinguished executives, Rick Fizdale, is retiring from active management after nearly 30 years. The BCOM3 boss will leave the company on December 31. Mr Fizdale, the group's vice-chairman and one of the key figures behind its launch, will continue to serve on the BCOM3 board of directors as vice-chairman but will no longer play an active role in running the business. His departure from the business ends a career that started in the creative department of Leo Burnett. He is one of the few in the industry who have successfully made the transition to management. BCOM3 was formed in March this year after the merger of Leo Burnett and MacManus and backed by Dentsu, Japan's biggest ad agency, with a multi-million pound investment. Prior to the merger, Mr Fizdale was chairman at Leo Burnett. Fizdale has spent his entire career at the agency. He joined in 1969 as a copywriter, rising through the ranks of the creative department. He became senior vice president of creative operations in 1979 and deputy director of creative services in 1982. He was named president and chief creative officer for Leo Burnett three years later and became chief creative officer for the agency's global network in 1985. In 1992 he added the title of chairman and chief executive officer. Under Mr Fizdale's watch as CEO from 1997, Leo Burnett grew from a global network of 84 offices in 75 countries to one that includes nearly 300 operating units in 90 countries. The agency also picked up major new business assignments from Heinz, Procter &amp; Gamble, Coca Cola and Delta Airlines. Roger Haupt will take over as chief executive officer. \"No one has done more to uphold the agency's creative standards, client-focused philosophy and work ethic than Rick has,\" said Linda Wolf, current CEO of Leo Burnett USA.",

      "body": "<p>It was, all too appropriately, a march to absolutely nowhere. The 500 Hackney residents and council workers, who joined last Monday's demonstration against proposed emergency cuts to council services, trudged through the wind and the rain on a long, circuitous route that took them only from Hackney Town Hall all the way back to Hackney Town Hall. </p> <p>For the poor benighted citizens of this poorest of London boroughs - a place that should serve as a warning to us all about what can happen when local government goes pitifully wrong - it just reinforced what they had always thought: in Hackney, nothing ever seems to move on. </p> <p>It was there, even in the style of the protest. Had it been shot in black and white by Path\u00e9 it could not have looked more like a relic from an earlier age. </p> <p>There were the Socialist Workers' Party placards. There were the fluttering union banners and the votes of support from striking health workers from distant corners of the nation. And there, too, were the rousers of the rabble with their rhythmic call-and-response chants by megaphone and their insistence that the solution was to 'Tax the rich. Make them pay'. </p> <p>This is the borough described by one resident as 'Britain's North Korea. It's the place modern politics forgot'. The protesters' chants at least had the virtue of simplifying the situation down to a failure of leftist will by local councillors. But it is not that straightforward, however much you might wish it to be so. True, the crisis is down to a failure on the part of councillors but, as with everything in this deprived corner of East London, there are lots of other people more than deserving of blame. </p> <p>Last month the Borough Treasurer, George Jenkins, announced that Hackney did not have enough money to meet the commitments it had made up to the end of this financial year. In short, like New York in the Seventies, it was going bust. Under the terms of local government legislation Jenkins was forced to issue a Section 114 order, which immediately barred the council from spending any money until it had agreed budget cuts, which means finding savings of around \u00a34.5 million this year and \u00a318m next. </p> <p>Coming in the same week as Chancellor Gordon Brown was opening up his bulging exchequer to buy off pensioners and fuel protesters, the proposed cuts made Hackney look like the council that New Labour had left behind. </p> <p>The effect of the 114 order was almost immediate. Headteachers across the borough passed a vote of no confidence in their education service - already part-privatised due to previous failures - and wrote to parents informing them that, because they would not be able to employ supply teachers, their children might not have classes to go to. Parks and gardening trucks ran out of fuel and were told not to fill up. Council work men were given orders to do the minimum work possible. </p> <p>In one instance, a council tenant had a new bath fitted but was told he couldn't have any taps because that would mean extra expense. Another was told they could fix the stopcock in his toilet cistern but not the leaking pipe to it, leaving him unable to flush. </p> <p>Wetherell Day Nursery closed because of a leaking roof nobody could afford to fix. Then a manager in the council's waste service dismissed all the temporary staff, and rubbish collections, always erratic, stopped. This weekend the streets overflow with rotting garbage. The rats, at least, are getting fatter. </p> <p>It was supposed to be so different. In June, Hackney gained a new managing director, Max Caller, former chief executive of Barnet council, who answered an advert looking for somebody willing to take on 'the job from hell'. It was by no means underselling the challenge: there had been damning Ofsted reports on Hackney schools and part of the social services department had already come under direct central government control. </p> <p>The month Caller started work, proclaiming a commitment to give the people of Hackney 'a better deal and a joined-up council doing the right things for them', the District Auditor issued a report that uncovered widespread mismanagement and inadequate accounting on a vast scale. Last week, just as the council was meeting to discuss the latest cuts, there was yet another damning report, this time by the new Best Value Inspection Service set up under recent local government legislation. </p> <p>'Hackney is not a well-run council and is letting down the people who live in the borough,' said Wendy Thomson, director of inspection at the Audit Commission. 'It is simply not delivering best value in council tax collection, payment of housing benefit, refuse collection, street sweeping or children's services.' No fewer than 17,000 people, she said, were awaiting payment of housing benefit. </p> <p>At the same time, Caller issued his own report, stuffed full of staggering allegations. Almost nothing at all, he said, was known about who was spending what. Local managers would hide the true costs of their services or would tell democratically elected members what they thought they wanted to hear instead of the truth. As a result, a \u00a35m contract with a private company for rubbish collection had to be delayed when it emerged that the cost of running the service was double that. Managers were also ignoring orders. </p> <p>When the council passed a resolution insisting no more permanent staff be employed, managers simply employed temporary ones, who turned out to cost more. It was clear, Caller announced, 'that the various moratoriums that were imposed were either not understood, ignored or subverted'. </p> <p>Ask the political classes of Hackney how it got to be this way and they will sigh and tell you it is a very long story. Partly, they will say, it is simple economics. The borough has few pockets of wealth and receives the fourth-highest central government grant in the country - \u00a31,220 per head of population. There are deep, dark pools of unemployment and poverty and areas where crime and drug abuse are rife. </p> <p>It was not always like this. Though there has long been poverty here, it was once a thriving borough with big department stores on the high streets and fine Georgian and Regency Squares now left isolated in the midst of dilapidated council estates. </p> <p>Throughout its history, those with money who have soaked up its rich diverse culture have eventually moved out. (In the Eighties, for example, a young married couple with promising careers as barristers lived in the Mapledene area of Hackney. In time they, too, decided to move to up-and-coming Islington and never looked back. Their names were Tony and Cherie Blair.) </p> <p>But economic deprivation does not explain all or, at least, not the most recent problems. 'There's simply been a failure of political culture in Hackney,' says Jules Pipe of the Labour Group who, with his Tory colleague Eric Ollerenshaw, now leads the council. He points at a split in Labour in 1996, when more than a dozen Labour members left the party. 'You will never get to the bottom of that split. It was just two groups of people who mutually hated each other. But the moment it became a hung council the idea of an administration with a scrutinising opposition went out the window. In short, there was an absence of administration.' </p> <p>Councillors busied themselves with feverish infighting to such a degree that the then chief executive, Tony Eliston, said he would install traffic lights in the council chamber to control floor-crossing by members. (One councillor, David Phillips, has sat as Labour, Hackney New Labour - nothing to do with the Blair-Mandelson version - Conservative, Independent, LibDem and now Green Party.) </p> <p>Meanwhile, without any scrutiny by councillors to trouble them, unelected managers set about creating fiefdoms within the council. </p> <p>In 1997 a new plan, 'Transforming Hackney', placed budgets in the hands of individual managers in an attempt to get council services closer to residents. Without any central financial management at all, Hackney council was at the mercy of legions of incompetent council officials. </p> <p>The question Hackney residents are now asking themselves is whether the severe cuts announced last week - up to 500 jobs may go, employees are being given new working terms and conditions, council trading units are being closed down, services are being withdrawn - are merely a symptom of the chronic disease or the cure. </p> <p>Pipe is in no doubt they are curing their ills. Labour and the Conservatives have decided to co-operate - shoving the Lib Dems into opposition - and so there is now a form of political stability for the first time in four years. 'Under Max Caller and his new team we also have management in place which has finally been able to identify the problems,' he says. </p> <p>Caller agrees. 'We have been able to take the decision that needed to be taken. We have introduced management controls which make it possible to handle the finances. I am determined to get best value for the people of Hackney.' Budget cuts, he says, are not necessarily the same as cuts in services. 'We simply need to improve efficiency and productivity.' How that will be done, he does not say. </p> <p>Whether the cuts agreed last Monday night will achieve all of this is open to question. Several are in complete contradiction to central government policy. For example, next year Hackney will cut more than \u00a3600,000 from its budget for early education at the same time as the Government is shoving it to the top of its agenda. </p> <p>Likewise, the borough has cut 48 beds from its residential care services for people coming out of hospital and slashed away at the budget for home care. The most likely outcome is that, because there will be nowhere to discharge them to, patients will lock up hospital beds, thus lengthening waiting lists. </p> <p>Even Caller admitted, in his report to the council, that this will have 'immediate repercussions on health, particularly through the winter period'. Likewise he admitted the changes he was proposing to the social services would mean cutting back on preventative work, even though it is a statutory requirement of all councils. </p> <p>Despite all of this, Whitehall will not be intervening to bail out Hackney. </p> <p>'I'm horrified by the position there,' said Local Government Minister Hillary Armstrong. 'It's a position no council should have got itself into. It's a position no residents should have to experience. But throwing money at the problem is not the solution. They have to get their own house in order.' </p> <p>So is she abandoning Hackney? 'Far from it. We will back them all the way. We just have to hope that they've got to the bottom of the deficit and that nobody's hiding any more debt.' </p> <p>Perhaps most worrying for the people of Hackney is that, technically, the borough is still bust. Despite the cuts, the budget is in no way balanced and it is only because of loan facilities agreed with central government late on Friday that the council can continue to spend money at all. </p> <p>Should there be any problems at all with these loans and the budget falls short, the Borough Treasurer will be forced to issue another Section 114 order. All spending will cease immediately. </p> <p>Toilets will remain unfixed. Roofs will leak. Rubbish will go uncollected. For the long-suffering people of Hackney, it will be business as usual.</p>",

The 500 Hackney residents and council workers, who joined last Monday's demonstration against proposed emergency cuts to council services, trudged through the wind and the rain on a long, circuitous route that took them only from Hackney Town Hall all the way back to Hackney Town Hall. For the poor benighted citizens of this poorest of London boroughs - a place that should serve as a warning to us all about what can happen when local government goes pitifully wrong - it just reinforced what they had always thought: in Hackney, nothing ever seems to move on. It was there, even in the style of the protest. Had it been shot in black and white by Path\u00e9 it could not have looked more like a relic from an earlier age. There were the Socialist Workers' Party placards. There were the fluttering union banners and the votes of support from striking health workers from distant corners of the nation. And there, too, were the rousers of the rabble with their rhythmic call-and-response chants by megaphone and their insistence that the solution was to 'Tax the rich. Make them pay'. This is the borough described by one resident as 'Britain's North Korea. It's the place modern politics forgot'. The protesters' chants at least had the virtue of simplifying the situation down to a failure of leftist will by local councillors. But it is not that straightforward, however much you might wish it to be so. True, the crisis is down to a failure on the part of councillors but, as with everything in this deprived corner of East London, there are lots of other people more than deserving of blame. Last month the Borough Treasurer, George Jenkins, announced that Hackney did not have enough money to meet the commitments it had made up to the end of this financial year. In short, like New York in the Seventies, it was going bust. Under the terms of local government legislation Jenkins was forced to issue a Section 114 order, which immediately barred the council from spending any money until it had agreed budget cuts, which means finding savings of around \u00a34.5 million this year and \u00a318m next. Coming in the same week as Chancellor Gordon Brown was opening up his bulging exchequer to buy off pensioners and fuel protesters, the proposed cuts made Hackney look like the council that New Labour had left behind. The effect of the 114 order was almost immediate. Headteachers across the borough passed a vote of no confidence in their education service - already part-privatised due to previous failures - and wrote to parents informing them that, because they would not be able to employ supply teachers, their children might not have classes to go to. Parks and gardening trucks ran out of fuel and were told not to fill up. Council work men were given orders to do the minimum work possible. In one instance, a council tenant had a new bath fitted but was told he couldn't have any taps because that would mean extra expense. Another was told they could fix the stopcock in his toilet cistern but not the leaking pipe to it, leaving him unable to flush. Wetherell Day Nursery closed because of a leaking roof nobody could afford to fix. Then a manager in the council's waste service dismissed all the temporary staff, and rubbish collections, always erratic, stopped. This weekend the streets overflow with rotting garbage. The rats, at least, are getting fatter. It was supposed to be so different. In June, Hackney gained a new managing director, Max Caller, former chief executive of Barnet council, who answered an advert looking for somebody willing to take on 'the job from hell'. It was by no means underselling the challenge: there had been damning Ofsted reports on Hackney schools and part of the social services department had already come under direct central government control. The month Caller started work, proclaiming a commitment to give the people of Hackney 'a better deal and a joined-up council doing the right things for them', the District Auditor issued a report that uncovered widespread mismanagement and inadequate accounting on a vast scale. Last week, just as the council was meeting to discuss the latest cuts, there was yet another damning report, this time by the new Best Value Inspection Service set up under recent local government legislation. 'Hackney is not a well-run council and is letting down the people who live in the borough,' said Wendy Thomson, director of inspection at the Audit Commission. 'It is simply not delivering best value in council tax collection, payment of housing benefit, refuse collection, street sweeping or children's services.' No fewer than 17,000 people, she said, were awaiting payment of housing benefit. At the same time, Caller issued his own report, stuffed full of staggering allegations. Almost nothing at all, he said, was known about who was spending what. Local managers would hide the true costs of their services or would tell democratically elected members what they thought they wanted to hear instead of the truth. As a result, a \u00a35m contract with a private company for rubbish collection had to be delayed when it emerged that the cost of running the service was double that. Managers were also ignoring orders. When the council passed a resolution insisting no more permanent staff be employed, managers simply employed temporary ones, who turned out to cost more. It was clear, Caller announced, 'that the various moratoriums that were imposed were either not understood, ignored or subverted'. Ask the political classes of Hackney how it got to be this way and they will sigh and tell you it is a very long story. Partly, they will say, it is simple economics. The borough has few pockets of wealth and receives the fourth-highest central government grant in the country - \u00a31,220 per head of population. There are deep, dark pools of unemployment and poverty and areas where crime and drug abuse are rife. It was not always like this. Though there has long been poverty here, it was once a thriving borough with big department stores on the high streets and fine Georgian and Regency Squares now left isolated in the midst of dilapidated council estates. Throughout its history, those with money who have soaked up its rich diverse culture have eventually moved out. (In the Eighties, for example, a young married couple with promising careers as barristers lived in the Mapledene area of Hackney. In time they, too, decided to move to up-and-coming Islington and never looked back. Their names were Tony and Cherie Blair.) But economic deprivation does not explain all or, at least, not the most recent problems. 'There's simply been a failure of political culture in Hackney,' says Jules Pipe of the Labour Group who, with his Tory colleague Eric Ollerenshaw, now leads the council. He points at a split in Labour in 1996, when more than a dozen Labour members left the party. 'You will never get to the bottom of that split. It was just two groups of people who mutually hated each other. But the moment it became a hung council the idea of an administration with a scrutinising opposition went out the window. In short, there was an absence of administration.' Councillors busied themselves with feverish infighting to such a degree that the then chief executive, Tony Eliston, said he would install traffic lights in the council chamber to control floor-crossing by members. (One councillor, David Phillips, has sat as Labour, Hackney New Labour - nothing to do with the Blair-Mandelson version - Conservative, Independent, LibDem and now Green Party.) Meanwhile, without any scrutiny by councillors to trouble them, unelected managers set about creating fiefdoms within the council. In 1997 a new plan, 'Transforming Hackney', placed budgets in the hands of individual managers in an attempt to get council services closer to residents. Without any central financial management at all, Hackney council was at the mercy of legions of incompetent council officials. The question Hackney residents are now asking themselves is whether the severe cuts announced last week - up to 500 jobs may go, employees are being given new working terms and conditions, council trading units are being closed down, services are being withdrawn - are merely a symptom of the chronic disease or the cure. Pipe is in no doubt they are curing their ills. Labour and the Conservatives have decided to co-operate - shoving the Lib Dems into opposition - and so there is now a form of political stability for the first time in four years. 'Under Max Caller and his new team we also have management in place which has finally been able to identify the problems,' he says. Caller agrees. 'We have been able to take the decision that needed to be taken. We have introduced management controls which make it possible to handle the finances. I am determined to get best value for the people of Hackney.' Budget cuts, he says, are not necessarily the same as cuts in services. 'We simply need to improve efficiency and productivity.' How that will be done, he does not say. Whether the cuts agreed last Monday night will achieve all of this is open to question. Several are in complete contradiction to central government policy. For example, next year Hackney will cut more than \u00a3600,000 from its budget for early education at the same time as the Government is shoving it to the top of its agenda. Likewise, the borough has cut 48 beds from its residential care services for people coming out of hospital and slashed away at the budget for home care. The most likely outcome is that, because there will be nowhere to discharge them to, patients will lock up hospital beds, thus lengthening waiting lists. Even Caller admitted, in his report to the council, that this will have 'immediate repercussions on health, particularly through the winter period'. Likewise he admitted the changes he was proposing to the social services would mean cutting back on preventative work, even though it is a statutory requirement of all councils. Despite all of this, Whitehall will not be intervening to bail out Hackney. 'I'm horrified by the position there,' said Local Government Minister Hillary Armstrong. 'It's a position no council should have got itself into. It's a position no residents should have to experience. But throwing money at the problem is not the solution. They have to get their own house in order.' So is she abandoning Hackney? 'Far from it. We will back them all the way. We just have to hope that they've got to the bottom of the deficit and that nobody's hiding any more debt.' Perhaps most worrying for the people of Hackney is that, technically, the borough is still bust. Despite the cuts, the budget is in no way balanced and it is only because of loan facilities agreed with central government late on Friday that the council can continue to spend money at all. Should there be any problems at all with these loans and the budget falls short, the Borough Treasurer will be forced to issue another Section 114 order. All spending will cease immediately. Toilets will remain unfixed. Roofs will leak. Rubbish will go uncollected. For the long-suffering people of Hackney, it will be business as usual.",

      "bodyText": "The Beatles today launched their first official release in cyberspace. Fans can get a Ticket To Ride on the information superhighway when the \u00a32m site goes live to coincide with today's release of the group's new greatest hits package. Web designers from around the world have been recruited to come up with the site which - like most of their releases - has been coordinated at London's Abbey Road studios. Each section of the site is based around one of the 27 tracks on the new album 1, all of which have been number ones. For the I Feel Fine section, a Paris-based company has come up with a new video for the song animation using monochrome images taken from stills. In the Yellow Submarine area, fans can play a Space Invaders-style game firing at the Blue Meanies, which featured in the Beatles' animated movie. Another game area, Help!, allows players to become members of the band and interact with other fans from around the world. The I Want To Hold Your Hand section allows web surfers to see the famous Studio 2 at Abbey Road as the Beatles themselves would have seen it. By clicking on Ringo Starr, for example, they can see the view he had from his drum stool. Anthony Couchi of record company EMI, who was project manager for the site, said the remaining members of the band were personally involved in setting it up. When the site launches today it will have just 10 sections, building up to the full 27 over the next three months. The greatest hits collection, The Beatles 1, went on sale today and HMV in London's Oxford Street opened for one hour from midnight to allow fans to buy the album. About 15 fans gathered at the store for the special opening, including Beatles fanatic Naoto Ito, who camped outside the shop from 7.30pm yesterday to become the first person to buy the album in Britain.

      "body": "<p>Imagine the following contemporary motoring dilemma: you are the driver of a top-of-the-range saloon car, probably provided for you by your place of work and updated annually, or as soon as the carpets get a bit scruffy. Your vehicle is, more likely than not, made in Germany and gets a weekly valet. And you are entirely happy that it answers to your desires for comfort, power, needless in-car gadgetry and shameless salary-flaunting. </p> <p>Yet something nags you. You see the way the market is going. The saloon car's hitherto unquestioned top role in the arena of status definition is now under pressure from (of all places) the sports utility vehicle - and in crude and worrying ways. People are driving vehicles that are much, much bigger than yours, although they may in fact be cheaper. With increasing frequency, people are questioning both your sexuality and your earning power by drawing alongside you in cars whose wheels come up to your roof. </p> <p>If this is you, then what you do next is very simple. You contact the company's fleet department and ask them to move you along to a Lexus RX300. As a saloon person, you'll feel immediately at home with the RX300 from the minute you open the door and the smell of several square miles of quality leather hits you. </p> <p>Indeed, all of the things one associates with a luxury saloon are present and correct in the Lexus: the CD-changer mounted in the glove compartment, the heated front seats (God forbid that your buttocks should ever go unpoached, even for a minute), the electric sunroof, the touch-screen navigation system. </p> <p>And yet, unlike your old saloon, the RX300 is the size of a minibus. It's set up to go booming across mountain ranges the hard way: the distance from the top of the wheels to the wheel arches (a crucial status signifier in this area) is a journey all by itself. The driving seat posts you up high for enhanced visibility and superior sneering possibilities. Indeed, it puts you right up there at the level of bus drivers and mounted policemen. And all this with the comforts of your old Audi entirely intact. </p> <p>It's that canny hybrid, then: an executive sports utility vehicle or, to use the market terms, a premium off-roader. The big question remains: having paid a premium price, who would wish to take a car like this off the road? It might get scratched. Anyway, the premium off-roader is not an original idea, though Lexus can perhaps be credited with having put their own twist on it by producing a hitherto unthought-of meeting between the SUV and a brand of quiet style. </p> <p>The RX300 looks like a Range Rover after a year spent learning some manners. Note the total absence, on the front of the vehicle, of the anti-elephant devices and snow-shovels that encumber the leading edges of the traditional SUV. Note the tasteful invisibility of the spare wheel. And note overall the general favouring of gentle slopes and smooth arcs over the blunt ends and comically muscular haunches typical of the genre. </p> <p>The overall design has gone down well in America, where Lexus was most famous for its saloons but where the RX300 is now its best-seller. Here, it makes the other vehicles in its class look hulking and brutish, with the possible exception of the BMW X5, but that will cost you nearly half as much again, and it's only fair that \u00a345,000 should buy you a car that doesn't look entirely like a steel bucket. </p> <p>At around \u00a330,000, the RX300's genuine rivals for price are the Jeep Grand Cherokee and the Land Rover Discovery. As befits an attack vehicle, the Jeep is a big bunch of hard lines and does not easily please the eye; while the Discovery is a rural monster, which should be driven only by people with ponies to deliver. On style grounds, the RX300 cleans up. </p> <p>The extent of the illusion within is uncanny. You know you are in an SUV because you have to pull your self up into the seat slightly and because your wing mirrors are the size of portable television screens. Rumour has it that, on a clear day, you can see seven adjoining counties in those wing mirrors. </p> <p>But despite all that, you have, at the wheel, the nearly seamless impression of sitting inside a saloon, albeit a particularly capacious one with flatteringly comfortable seats. (Your passenger is a chaste arm's length away from you, as if in business class. The people in the back? You can forget about them. They're miles behind.) </p> <p>And, just like a top-grade saloon, the RX300 seems determined to eliminate all discomfort caused by that old motoring bugbear - contact with the road. The engine whispers almost inaudibly, somewhere out in the front. In any case, the gearbox is automatic, so the engine has its own agenda. You just have to sit there, your foot lightly on the accelerator, feeling your own worth coursing through the leather. </p> <p>Just about the only indication that you are in motion at all is the fact that the petrol tank sheds a gallon every 21 miles or so. It's not an astoundingly economical choice, the executive SUV, but you would probably have realised that already.

But even he surpassed himself when the Fulham bus got becalmed in traffic and he ordered his players to do their pre-match warm-up by jogging two miles to the stadium. </p> <p>Fulham carried their unpredictability on to the pitch and it was all too much for this featureless Wimbledon side to handle. On a filthy afternoon in south London they gradually capitulated, Fulham retaking their rightful place at the top of the table. </p> <p>\"I watched them four times before this game and a lot of good it did me,\" said the Wimbledon manager Terry Burton. \"They've got lots of options and they can hit you from all sides.\" </p> <p>Fulham simply proved that they are the best side outside the top flight and probably better than a third of those in it. It was not just their skill and fluidity that caused the opposition problems on Saturday but their willingness to stand up to Wimbledon aggression and keep coming back for more. \"Everyone talks about their passing ability but they are the hardest-working team in this league,\" said Burton. </p> <p>Also the most inspirational, their improviser-in-chief was Louis Saha, the young Frenchman who is currently setting the First Division alight. He continued to build on a jaw-dropping start to his Fulham career by scoring twice to take his tally to 17 this season. \"My ambition is to do well in the Premier League with Fulham next season,\" he said. </p> <p>It is a remarkable record considering that there seemed little to suggest, before Tigana made him his first signing this summer at \u00a32.1m from Metz, that he was capable of such a sudden impact. Although he played for the French Under-18s he appears to have scored only four times for Metz and a loan spell at Newcastle in January 1999 proved frustrating. He made 11 appearances for the club, five as substitute, producing two goals and a fractured cheekbone that interrupted his progress. </p> <p>\"He's got unbelievable pace and a great touch and if teams are playing tight and pushing up we can just get the ball over the top and he's on to it in a flash. The only problem is we can't keep up with him,\" said Fulham's midfielder Lee Clark. </p> <p>Tigana has compared the 22-year-old to Thierry Henry and the comparison is apt. Both are lithe, brave, lightning fast and ruthless. If anything, Saha is the more two-footed as he showed with his goals. </p> <p>The first came out of nothing, a sudden turn into space outside the box and an explosive right-foot shot. The second was a penalty after Alan Kimble had felled Luis Boa Morte, confidently dispatched left-footed. Barry Hayles rounded off an impressive team effort with a tap-in but the day belonged to Saha.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Jean Tigana, as both player and manager, could have taught John Coltrane a thing or two about improvisation. But even he surpassed himself when the Fulham bus got becalmed in traffic and he ordered his players to do their pre-match warm-up by jogging two miles to the stadium. Fulham carried their unpredictability on to the pitch and it was all too much for this featureless Wimbledon side to handle. On a filthy afternoon in south London they gradually capitulated, Fulham retaking their rightful place at the top of the table. \"I watched them four times before this game and a lot of good it did me,\" said the Wimbledon manager Terry Burton. \"They've got lots of options and they can hit you from all sides.\" Fulham simply proved that they are the best side outside the top flight and probably better than a third of those in it. It was not just their skill and fluidity that caused the opposition problems on Saturday but their willingness to stand up to Wimbledon aggression and keep coming back for more. \"Everyone talks about their passing ability but they are the hardest-working team in this league,\" said Burton. Also the most inspirational, their improviser-in-chief was Louis Saha, the young Frenchman who is currently setting the First Division alight. He continued to build on a jaw-dropping start to his Fulham career by scoring twice to take his tally to 17 this season. \"My ambition is to do well in the Premier League with Fulham next season,\" he said. It is a remarkable record considering that there seemed little to suggest, before Tigana made him his first signing this summer at \u00a32.1m from Metz, that he was capable of such a sudden impact. Although he played for the French Under-18s he appears to have scored only four times for Metz and a loan spell at Newcastle in January 1999 proved frustrating. He made 11 appearances for the club, five as substitute, producing two goals and a fractured cheekbone that interrupted his progress. \"He's got unbelievable pace and a great touch and if teams are playing tight and pushing up we can just get the ball over the top and he's on to it in a flash. The only problem is we can't keep up with him,\" said Fulham's midfielder Lee Clark. Tigana has compared the 22-year-old to Thierry Henry and the comparison is apt. Both are lithe, brave, lightning fast and ruthless. If anything, Saha is the more two-footed as he showed with his goals. The first came out of nothing, a sudden turn into space outside the box and an explosive right-foot shot. The second was a penalty after Alan Kimble had felled Luis Boa Morte, confidently dispatched left-footed. Barry Hayles rounded off an impressive team effort with a tap-in but the day belonged to Saha.",

      "trailText": "<p>Under David Yelland, the Sun has wised up but lost readers. However, if the red-top thinks it can turn to the chattering classes for extra circulation it is mistaken.</p>",
      "byline": "Roy Greenslade",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In a London club, which must remain nameless because of the rules, you understand, a gentleman who once worked in the higher echelons of the Daily Mirror, as it was then called, was asked what he thought of the Sun at present. Unhesitatingly, he replied: \"I think it's becoming a serious political paper. Very good, very good.\" </p> <p>A neighbour, a distinguished former executive at a serious broadsheet newspaper, nodded in agreement. \"Don't see it much,\" he said. \"But people show it to me. Yes, better, I think. More serious, yes.\" </p> <p>If Sun editor David Yelland had been there he would have preened himself at burgeoning credibility for his paper among the chattering class. Indeed, he may be smiling as he reads this. There is little doubt that Yelland has devoted more space to politics than his predecessor, Stuart Higgins, with splashes, full-page leading articles, and all manner of spreads. </p> <p>This is no accident, because he has made it clear in the past that he wants the Sun to be at the heart of Britain's political discourse. He has also chosen to do so in a traditional Sun way. Hence \"the most dangerous man in Britain\" tag applied to Tony Blair, and the plastering of William Hague's head on to a parrot, first deceased and then resurrected. </p> <p>Political editor Trevor Kavanagh is given plenty of chances to air his views. Hardly a day passes without a leader disparaging the idea of the European single currency. </p> <p>Yelland's current agenda reminds me of the Sun during Larry Lamb's final years as editor. Previously, he had managed to maintain a delicate balance between serious and trivial editorial content. Then, after his knighthood and drawn closer still to Westminster and Whitehall through his friendship with Margaret Thatcher, he overdid the politics. </p> <p>It wasn't that his political diatribes were out of step with the majority viewpoint of his audience. What clearly upset readers was not only the fact that politics dominated the paper, but that it was too hectoring, too lacking in subtlety, too unappetising for palates used to a less meaty diet. The result? Readers began to drift away. Lamb's Sun plunged from almost 4m at the end of 1978 to 3.6m at the beginning of 1981. And the main beneficiary? Not the Daily Mirror, which continued its downward drift, but none other than the Daily Star, launched in November 1978 and selling more than 1.5m by the middle of 1981. </p> <p>Yelland might well consider this history lesson as he studies the latest sales figures in the table on the right. The Sun fell below 3.6m in October. </p> <p>Yet its deserters do not appear to be climbing aboard the Mirror ship which is finding it tougher still to hang on to circulation, and is some 2.5% down on last year. Instead, the red-top that is bucking the trend by adding sales is the Daily Star: up last month by almost 6% over October last year and almost 3% up on its six-monthly average too. </p> <p>Of course, the overall numbers are small, and the continuing contribution of its Dublin-based Irish edition remains crucial. But it's not too improbable to surmise that some Sun readers are turning to the Star in its less strident, less fleshy guise under editor Peter Hill and his deputy, Hugh Whittow. </p> <p>With Express Newspapers up for sale (and please, Clive Hollick, don't give us that claptrap about it not being so) the Star's modest, but significant, turn-around in fortunes couldn't be better timed. With the Sun selling virtually 3m more than the Star, Yelland and his boss, Rupert Murdoch, are hardly going to panic. On the other hand, they might just wonder if the paper is now unbalanced. </p> <p>The Sun's dilemma, trying to \"wise up\" its material without alienating its core audience, raises a wider point about the famed \"dumbing down\" debate which rages persistently around the broadsheets. The Guardian's editor, Alan Rusbridger, last week countered the widely-held notion that the serious press is just not serious enough any longer. </p> <p>Implicit in his article, which points out the need to appeal to a wider audience, is the insistence that broadsheets are the natural inheritors of the future newspaper-reading audience. </p> <p>This isn't entirely true, of course.

      "bodyText": "In a London club, which must remain nameless because of the rules, you understand, a gentleman who once worked in the higher echelons of the Daily Mirror, as it was then called, was asked what he thought of the Sun at present. Unhesitatingly, he replied: \"I think it's becoming a serious political paper. Very good, very good.\" A neighbour, a distinguished former executive at a serious broadsheet newspaper, nodded in agreement. \"Don't see it much,\" he said. \"But people show it to me. Yes, better, I think. More serious, yes.\" If Sun editor David Yelland had been there he would have preened himself at burgeoning credibility for his paper among the chattering class. Indeed, he may be smiling as he reads this. There is little doubt that Yelland has devoted more space to politics than his predecessor, Stuart Higgins, with splashes, full-page leading articles, and all manner of spreads. This is no accident, because he has made it clear in the past that he wants the Sun to be at the heart of Britain's political discourse. He has also chosen to do so in a traditional Sun way. Hence \"the most dangerous man in Britain\" tag applied to Tony Blair, and the plastering of William Hague's head on to a parrot, first deceased and then resurrected. Political editor Trevor Kavanagh is given plenty of chances to air his views. Hardly a day passes without a leader disparaging the idea of the European single currency. Yelland's current agenda reminds me of the Sun during Larry Lamb's final years as editor. Previously, he had managed to maintain a delicate balance between serious and trivial editorial content. Then, after his knighthood and drawn closer still to Westminster and Whitehall through his friendship with Margaret Thatcher, he overdid the politics. It wasn't that his political diatribes were out of step with the majority viewpoint of his audience. What clearly upset readers was not only the fact that politics dominated the paper, but that it was too hectoring, too lacking in subtlety, too unappetising for palates used to a less meaty diet. The result? Readers began to drift away. Lamb's Sun plunged from almost 4m at the end of 1978 to 3.6m at the beginning of 1981. And the main beneficiary? Not the Daily Mirror, which continued its downward drift, but none other than the Daily Star, launched in November 1978 and selling more than 1.5m by the middle of 1981. Yelland might well consider this history lesson as he studies the latest sales figures in the table on the right. The Sun fell below 3.6m in October. Yet its deserters do not appear to be climbing aboard the Mirror ship which is finding it tougher still to hang on to circulation, and is some 2.5% down on last year. Instead, the red-top that is bucking the trend by adding sales is the Daily Star: up last month by almost 6% over October last year and almost 3% up on its six-monthly average too. Of course, the overall numbers are small, and the continuing contribution of its Dublin-based Irish edition remains crucial. But it's not too improbable to surmise that some Sun readers are turning to the Star in its less strident, less fleshy guise under editor Peter Hill and his deputy, Hugh Whittow. With Express Newspapers up for sale (and please, Clive Hollick, don't give us that claptrap about it not being so) the Star's modest, but significant, turn-around in fortunes couldn't be better timed. With the Sun selling virtually 3m more than the Star, Yelland and his boss, Rupert Murdoch, are hardly going to panic. On the other hand, they might just wonder if the paper is now unbalanced. The Sun's dilemma, trying to \"wise up\" its material without alienating its core audience, raises a wider point about the famed \"dumbing down\" debate which rages persistently around the broadsheets. The Guardian's editor, Alan Rusbridger, last week countered the widely-held notion that the serious press is just not serious enough any longer. Implicit in his article, which points out the need to appeal to a wider audience, is the insistence that broadsheets are the natural inheritors of the future newspaper-reading audience. This isn't entirely true, of course. The Daily Mail has shown that it is possible to use the tabloid format without adopting a red-top agenda. Indeed, its creators - Vere Rothermere and David English - always maintained that their aim in transforming the broadsheet Mail into a tabloid was to synthesise the two. The fact that their experiment took more than 20 years, and the editorship of Paul Dacre, to become successful, shows how difficult a task it was. It also illustrates how improbable it is for red-tops, trapped by the majority of their declining readership into supplying tits and trivia , to effect change. They cannot broaden their agenda in the way that broadsheets have done to satisfy people who now have a greater range of interests than ever before. This isn't about dumbing down. It is a concrete recognition of a cultural change. Hang on, Yelland might well say. Look at the figures. The Guardian isn't taking away our readers. The Times is drifting downwards. The Daily Telegraph struggles to keep its sale over 1m. The Independent is relying on bulks and printing abroad to give its circulation a gloss. But this is a snapshot view, a superficial argument that overlooks the long-term trend. In general, the British population is becoming more middle class, enjoying better educational standards, social conditions and economic benefits. Though broadsheets are finding the market difficult at present, using similar devices to boost sales as the red-tops, these are the papers gearing themselves more obviously to a changed audience. Their larger, more diverse, packages are more appealing both to readers and advertisers. If we turn to the Sundays, there is clearer proof of this trend. The red-tops are losing sales by the month and the Sunday Express is, to be frank, at crisis point. Only the broadsheets and the Mail on Sunday offer any sign of stability, with the Sunday Times at 1.4m and the Observer enjoying a renaissance. The Sunday Telegraph is finding life more difficult and the Independent on Sunday is also treading water. But these titles offer better value for money than their rivals, provide better quality, and unashamedly plug celebrity interviews alongside intelligent analyses of the American presidential election. In the end, I am sure that class will count. Are you still smiling, Mr Yelland?

Or was it the later bulletin to the effect that George Bush, and not Gore, had won Florida, and, hence, the presidency? In fact, it was neither. The above reactions occurred in the autumn of 1938, when Orson Welles mischievously chose to heighten the dramatic effect of his American radio presentation of War of the Worlds by making it seem that a Martian spacecraft had landed in a small New Jersey town. </p> <p>Ah, what a simple, guileless people we must have been. How often, and with what condescension did later generations of journalists look back and laugh at Welles's spoof, scoffing at the widespread panic it caused. </p> <p>That had been, of course, before the dawn of the Information Age, and at a time when not even a Wellesian imagination could have conjured anything resembling the internet. </p> <p>You might think, nonetheless, that as Americans, we'd take a dose of scepticism with our scoops. After all, we've learned to mistrust. The school of hard knocks to the heart that opened in the 1960s taught us that nothing was as it seemed; that glittering image more often than not was merely a mask for sordid reality. </p> <p>Many of the most affecting images carried into our homes, hearts and minds by TV were every bit as spurious as Orson Welles's \"Martians\". The Camelot so carefully crafted for television by Kennedy courtiers turned out to be pasteboard facade; our government used television to repeatedly lie to us about every aspect of the Vietnam war; and, despite millions of dollars spent on commercials designed to persuade us of the opposite, we discovered that cigarettes did cause cancer, alcohol did destroy lives, automobiles were not inherently safe, and - most of all - politicians were not to be trusted. </p> <p>From my own first book, The Selling of the President, 1968, I carried forward as a mantra the dictum of the adviser to Richard Nixon that, \"it's not what's there that counts; it's what's projected\". He meant, of course, projected by and through television. </p> <p>\"The medium is the message,\" Marshall McLuhan wrote in those same long-ago 60s, but what he intended as a warning to the masses became instead a guiding light for the politically savvy and media elite, who understood instinctively the potential for distortion and deception it implied. </p> <p>One is tempted, therefore, to see it as progress when, after decades during which politicians spent near-infinite amounts of time and money using television to deceive the people, at long last - and however inadvertently - came television's turn to trick the tricksters. </p> <p>\"If we say somebody carried a state, you can take that to the bank,\" Dan Rather proclaimed on CBS, only moments before he said: \"Al Gore has won the state of Florida.\" An hour later, however - withdrawing our deposit and hiding it under the mattress, as it were - Rather said Florida was \"too close to call\". But not for long: the networks thrive by purporting to be voices of authority and uncertainty is not a welcome guest behind their walls. In less time than it would have taken a Martian to propel himself from Grovers Mill, New Jersey to New York City, Rather's CBS and the other four networks announced that it had not been Gore, as they'd earlier said, but instead George Bush who'd taken Florida. </p> <p>And with that wee-hours announcement, champagne corks popped, skyrockets soared, and strangers kissed strangers (of the opposite sex, it must be stressed) all over Austin. </p> <p>The ever-effusive Rather confusingly exhorted viewers to, \"Sip it, savour it, photostat it, hang it out on a wall: George Bush is the next president of the United States!\" </p> <p>Hearing that, candidate Gore called candidate Bush to concede. After all, if they'd seen it on television (and did not recognise it as one of their own manipulations), it must be true. </p> <p>But then NBC's Tom Brokaw intoned without a shred of irony, \"What the networks giveth, the networks taketh away,\" and, quick as a wink, both Florida's electoral votes and Bush's putative presidency vanished into a murky Everglades swamp, the bottom of which we've apparently not yet seen. </p> <p>Still, as Americans, we rest easy. Let others fret about messy, confusing reality. We can just go on living in the simple two-dimensional world our television networks have constructed for us, in order to assure that none of us is ever tempted to have an original thought.</p>",

He meant, of course, projected by and through television. \"The medium is the message,\" Marshall McLuhan wrote in those same long-ago 60s, but what he intended as a warning to the masses became instead a guiding light for the politically savvy and media elite, who understood instinctively the potential for distortion and deception it implied. One is tempted, therefore, to see it as progress when, after decades during which politicians spent near-infinite amounts of time and money using television to deceive the people, at long last - and however inadvertently - came television's turn to trick the tricksters. \"If we say somebody carried a state, you can take that to the bank,\" Dan Rather proclaimed on CBS, only moments before he said: \"Al Gore has won the state of Florida.\" An hour later, however - withdrawing our deposit and hiding it under the mattress, as it were - Rather said Florida was \"too close to call\". But not for long: the networks thrive by purporting to be voices of authority and uncertainty is not a welcome guest behind their walls. In less time than it would have taken a Martian to propel himself from Grovers Mill, New Jersey to New York City, Rather's CBS and the other four networks announced that it had not been Gore, as they'd earlier said, but instead George Bush who'd taken Florida. And with that wee-hours announcement, champagne corks popped, skyrockets soared, and strangers kissed strangers (of the opposite sex, it must be stressed) all over Austin. The ever-effusive Rather confusingly exhorted viewers to, \"Sip it, savour it, photostat it, hang it out on a wall: George Bush is the next president of the United States!\" Hearing that, candidate Gore called candidate Bush to concede. After all, if they'd seen it on television (and did not recognise it as one of their own manipulations), it must be true. But then NBC's Tom Brokaw intoned without a shred of irony, \"What the networks giveth, the networks taketh away,\" and, quick as a wink, both Florida's electoral votes and Bush's putative presidency vanished into a murky Everglades swamp, the bottom of which we've apparently not yet seen. Still, as Americans, we rest easy. Let others fret about messy, confusing reality. We can just go on living in the simple two-dimensional world our television networks have constructed for us, in order to assure that none of us is ever tempted to have an original thought.",

Well, we are increasingly the gatekeepers to crucial access for a story, barring the way to a simple quote by a bureaucratic procedure that can look like, and sometimes is, a way of buying time and agreeing \"a line\" first.

      "body": "<p>Tucked away in a far corner of the BBC News empire in west London sits a tiny group of journalists who last week found they'd suddenly become very fashionable indeed. I've come to a once well-kept secret, The Working Lunch. This snappy daily half hour of live business and money news is broadcast at 12.30pm every weekday on BBC2 to pensioners, home workers, and students - sandwiched incongruously between schools programmes and Fireman Sam. </p> <p>Until Greg Dyke praised it for innovation at the CBI conference last week, Working Lunch, though running for six years, was virtually ignored by BBC news bosses, who love their politics and define a good day's work as making waves with the Today programme. The Lunch team simply toils away, head down from 5.30 each morning. This explains how the shirtsleeved presenters Adam Shaw and Adrian Chiles, a gritty Brummie who could pass as Warren Clarke's son, have honed their unconventional style, mixing a dash of slapstick and repartee with informed reporting. (On one notable occasion, M&amp;S knickers were brandished to demonstrate the store's problems). </p> <p>It also goes to explain how they alighted on a key weapon, their own broadcast truck, which trundles from the Rolls Royce shopfloor in Derby, via a Dudley aluminium factory and on to the Lewes floods for a story about insurance claims, giving the programme a non-metropolitan, even non-BBC feel.

      "bodyText": "Tucked away in a far corner of the BBC News empire in west London sits a tiny group of journalists who last week found they'd suddenly become very fashionable indeed. I've come to a once well-kept secret, The Working Lunch. This snappy daily half hour of live business and money news is broadcast at 12.30pm every weekday on BBC2 to pensioners, home workers, and students - sandwiched incongruously between schools programmes and Fireman Sam. Until Greg Dyke praised it for innovation at the CBI conference last week, Working Lunch, though running for six years, was virtually ignored by BBC news bosses, who love their politics and define a good day's work as making waves with the Today programme. The Lunch team simply toils away, head down from 5.30 each morning. This explains how the shirtsleeved presenters Adam Shaw and Adrian Chiles, a gritty Brummie who could pass as Warren Clarke's son, have honed their unconventional style, mixing a dash of slapstick and repartee with informed reporting. (On one notable occasion, M&amp;S knickers were brandished to demonstrate the store's problems). It also goes to explain how they alighted on a key weapon, their own broadcast truck, which trundles from the Rolls Royce shopfloor in Derby, via a Dudley aluminium factory and on to the Lewes floods for a story about insurance claims, giving the programme a non-metropolitan, even non-BBC feel. They've also \"adopted\" two pensioners, to comment acidly on government concessions. Programme editor Tracey Hobbs says: \"We don't ram business down the audience's throats. I like to think we make it relevant to people's lives.\" Their worry is that Dyke's new-found enthusiasm could be a poisoned chalice, subjecting them to far more scrutiny - hence less risk taking, and more boring conventional news packages. Dyke's decision, as the corporation's editor-in-chief, to hire Sunday Business editor Jeff Randall in an attempt to make business as important as politics and foreign affairs means that the whole BBC machine has to sit up and take notice. His traditionally liberal-minded staff may be sceptical - not least the all-powerful news programme editors - but even Newsnight is getting its own dedicated business reporter, joining 11 existing on-air business journalists. Dyke's proposals contained a specific commitment to experiment with an hour-long Working Lunch from December 11 - a commitment that has not met with unbridled enthusiasm. Randall says the idea of a business programme at lunchtime is bizarre, pointing out that most business professionals are only available to watch or listen at around 7am or after 10pm. But Randall is not alone in having doubts. Here on the shopfloor the team are not entirely thrilled. Sure, they are preparing extra material: Adrian and Adam spent an afternoon last week working at a firm selling Christmas hampers, a follow-on from their look at the micro-economics of running a fish and chip shop. As Hobbs says: \"An evening slot would be lovely\". The problem is obvious: people who would genuinely find the programme relevant and take viewing figures over 1m- business employers and employees - are all working at 12.30pm. The presenters are mobbed when they go to events attended by small investors, but virtually ignored at the CBI. And they share a common problem with all other news programmes. Business leaders by and large refuse to go on television or radio, recorded or live, expecting to be monstered. Chiles points out that the financial services authority, devised to protect investors, hates speaking to Working Lunch, as do the big banks. Hobbs says she's inundated by new internet companies, desperate for a mention, while most press officers of quoted companies refuse to let the team through to their chief executives. She was part of Dyke's charm offensive at the CBI and finds she is wringing acceptances from bosses by meeting them at dinners. \"They need to come on and be answerable\".

      "bodyText": "What is it? \"A delicious blend of barley, malt and cocoa fortified with eight vitamins and minerals,\" according to marketing. Best known as the bedtime tipple of Alan Bennett characters and Val Doonican fans. Likely to make anyone over 25 break into song and bring back hazy memories of a cheerful country girl with a sheaf of wheat and a basket of eggs. What's the problem? Declining sales. Manufacturer Novartis is battling rival Horlicks, but both have struggled in recent years. So? Novartis is launching a \u00a32m campaign to highlight the drink's energy-giving properties. Marketing manager Paul Simpson says: \"People think it's designed to make you go to sleep, but actually for all of the last century, it was promoted as an energy-giving drink.\" History First made by Dr George Wander, a Swiss chemist, in 1909. A year later, his son Albert set up a company to manufacture Ovaltine in Hertfordshire. It was recognised as an official sports drink at the 1948 Olympic Games at Wembley, where 25,000 cups were served to athletes. Muhammad Ali has claimed to drink the stuff and it has been supplied to every Mount Everest expedition since 1933, including Sir Edmund Hillary's successful attempt in 1953. Who drinks it? 50% of drinkers are women; 40% men and 10% children. The company is mainly targeting women over 35. What the experts say Tim Barson of brand consultancy Identica believes Ovaltine faces an uphill struggle. \"I'd question the wisdom of spending all that money on advertising when the basic product's still the same. If you want to change people's perceptions, you have to look at the taste, format and distribution of the product. Otherwise it's likely to be wasted money.\" The future Trendy cafes and bars across the country. Vodka Ovaltine, anyone?",

The stock was marked down nearly 45% or 217.5p to 272.5p, a quarter of its peak value this year at 937p. In a statement to the Stock Exchange, the company blamed the mark-down on the re-evaluation of its French business earlier this year. Future Network was forced to call in accountants Deloitte &amp; Touche after a \u00a31.1m shortfall was discovered. The company also blamed the \"continued softness\" of the computer games market in the final months of the year, pointing to Sony's announcement of a cutback in its allocation of PlayStation 2 units in Europe by nearly 20%, following a 50% allocation in the US.

      "body": "<p>An extensive and harrowing salvage operation to uncover the victims of a fire which engulfed an Alpine train in Austria got under way last night. The 155 victims so far have been identified with \"90% certainty\".</p> <p>For much of the day rescue teams were prevented from approaching the remains of what was once described as the world's safest train by extreme temperatures, toxic fumes and concerns that the 5cm thick cable by which the wreckage is suspended could snap and send it plummeting towards the valley below.</p> <p>Forensic scientists worked with rescue workers in the tunnel, using special lighting. \"It will take a very long time, and it's dark and very cold,\" Franz Schausberger, governor of the province of Salzburg, said.</p> <p>A fireman hinted at the horror. \"It looked absolutely terrible,\" he said, \"so much so that I can't even begin to describe what I saw because I don't want to upset the victims' relatives.\"</p> <p>Two railway workers who went into the tunnel on Saturday reported that the train's metal base was all that remained following the 1,000C blaze.</p> <p>The fire, whose cause is as yet unknown, began at the lower end of the train's single carriage with the train 600m into the tunnel. Just 18 people reacted quickly enough to save themselves.For the rest there was no hope.</p> <p>One survivor told doctors that he used a hammer to smash a window and throw his daughter to safety. At least 10 others followed him. Another survivor, a woman, said: \"My only thought was to get out and I could save myself in the last second because a window was kicked in and I could fight my way outside.\" Another six people waiting at the station at the top of the tunnel also escaped.</p> <p>The Austrian chancellor, Wolfgang Sch\u00fcssel, called the Kaprun disaster \"the biggest tragedy in the history of Austrian winter sport\". Joined in Kaprun on a visit to relatives of the victims by the vice chancellor, Susanne Riess-Passer, he said that the whole country had been stunned by the tragedy. \"We're here as a sign of solidarity,\" he said.</p> <p>But he stressed that Austria continued to be \"one of the safest countries in the world\" for winter sports. \"The safety guarantee is still top of our agenda for visitors to Austria,\" he said. \"We have an extremely high level of safety. We invest billions in our lift companies every year and we need our best experts to work out what happened and we'll do our best to solve it.\"</p> <p>The buzz of rescue helicopters was the only sound cutting through a crisp autumn day, a repeat of Saturday's perfect skiing conditions that drew crowds of young skiers and snowboarders for a gala opening to the winter season.</p> <p>Empty cable-car gondolas, used on Saturday to evacuate 2,500 people, floated above pylons carrying the track up a one-in-two gradient to the mouth of the tunnel, which still belched out occasional clouds of smoke more than 24 hours after the fire.</p> <p>A sign in the ticket window said simply: \"We are mourning\". Another rescue worker shook his head as he remembered the predominantly young skiers and snowboarders packed into the train. \"They had no chance,\" he said.</p> <p>It remains unclear how the fire began. Rumours in Kaprun circulated all day with suggestions that fireworks, cooking gas canisters, a cigarette or a can of diesel on board may have been to blame. Erix Buxbaumn, Austria's head of public security, speculated that a fire on the tracks, possibly caused by an electrical fault, set the train on fire.</p> <p>\"We have received information that the light of a fire was already visible to outside witnesses as the train was entering the tunnel,\" said Mr Buxbaumn. He indicated that if the driver had spotted the fire it would have been too late to stop. A second train, thought to have been carrying just a driver, was travelling down the tunnel at the time of the fire. The driver is presumed dead.</p> <p>Pressure is bound to mount on the cable car operating company, Gletscherbahn Kaprun, which admitted that there was no contingency plan for a fire in the tunnel. \"It wasn't provided for - we were taken by suprise,\" said Manfred Mueller, head of technical operations.</p> <p>There were no fire extinguishers on board and the automatic doors are understood to have locked shut, trapping the skiiers in what within minutes became a tomb. The end would have been brief. The tunnel, raked upwards at an angle of 45 degrees, sucked up heat and smoke.</p> <p>Once the blaze began consuming oxygen it would have created a vacuum that set more air rushing towards it, to fan itself from a small flame into a big one.

      "bodyText": "An extensive and harrowing salvage operation to uncover the victims of a fire which engulfed an Alpine train in Austria got under way last night. The 155 victims so far have been identified with \"90% certainty\". For much of the day rescue teams were prevented from approaching the remains of what was once described as the world's safest train by extreme temperatures, toxic fumes and concerns that the 5cm thick cable by which the wreckage is suspended could snap and send it plummeting towards the valley below. Forensic scientists worked with rescue workers in the tunnel, using special lighting. \"It will take a very long time, and it's dark and very cold,\" Franz Schausberger, governor of the province of Salzburg, said. A fireman hinted at the horror. \"It looked absolutely terrible,\" he said, \"so much so that I can't even begin to describe what I saw because I don't want to upset the victims' relatives.\" Two railway workers who went into the tunnel on Saturday reported that the train's metal base was all that remained following the 1,000C blaze. The fire, whose cause is as yet unknown, began at the lower end of the train's single carriage with the train 600m into the tunnel. Just 18 people reacted quickly enough to save themselves.For the rest there was no hope. One survivor told doctors that he used a hammer to smash a window and throw his daughter to safety. At least 10 others followed him. Another survivor, a woman, said: \"My only thought was to get out and I could save myself in the last second because a window was kicked in and I could fight my way outside.\" Another six people waiting at the station at the top of the tunnel also escaped. The Austrian chancellor, Wolfgang Sch\u00fcssel, called the Kaprun disaster \"the biggest tragedy in the history of Austrian winter sport\". Joined in Kaprun on a visit to relatives of the victims by the vice chancellor, Susanne Riess-Passer, he said that the whole country had been stunned by the tragedy. \"We're here as a sign of solidarity,\" he said. But he stressed that Austria continued to be \"one of the safest countries in the world\" for winter sports. \"The safety guarantee is still top of our agenda for visitors to Austria,\" he said. \"We have an extremely high level of safety. We invest billions in our lift companies every year and we need our best experts to work out what happened and we'll do our best to solve it.\" The buzz of rescue helicopters was the only sound cutting through a crisp autumn day, a repeat of Saturday's perfect skiing conditions that drew crowds of young skiers and snowboarders for a gala opening to the winter season. Empty cable-car gondolas, used on Saturday to evacuate 2,500 people, floated above pylons carrying the track up a one-in-two gradient to the mouth of the tunnel, which still belched out occasional clouds of smoke more than 24 hours after the fire. A sign in the ticket window said simply: \"We are mourning\". Another rescue worker shook his head as he remembered the predominantly young skiers and snowboarders packed into the train. \"They had no chance,\" he said. It remains unclear how the fire began. Rumours in Kaprun circulated all day with suggestions that fireworks, cooking gas canisters, a cigarette or a can of diesel on board may have been to blame. Erix Buxbaumn, Austria's head of public security, speculated that a fire on the tracks, possibly caused by an electrical fault, set the train on fire. \"We have received information that the light of a fire was already visible to outside witnesses as the train was entering the tunnel,\" said Mr Buxbaumn. He indicated that if the driver had spotted the fire it would have been too late to stop. A second train, thought to have been carrying just a driver, was travelling down the tunnel at the time of the fire. The driver is presumed dead. Pressure is bound to mount on the cable car operating company, Gletscherbahn Kaprun, which admitted that there was no contingency plan for a fire in the tunnel. \"It wasn't provided for - we were taken by suprise,\" said Manfred Mueller, head of technical operations. There were no fire extinguishers on board and the automatic doors are understood to have locked shut, trapping the skiiers in what within minutes became a tomb. The end would have been brief. The tunnel, raked upwards at an angle of 45 degrees, sucked up heat and smoke. Once the blaze began consuming oxygen it would have created a vacuum that set more air rushing towards it, to fan itself from a small flame into a big one. Confined fires always burn more furiously than unconfined fires, and the tunnel, drawing oxygen at an accelerating rate from below it, is a perfect example of a confined space. For those who did not react immediately, the consequences were terrible and swift. Machines are built of steel and alloy, but parts will burn, if there is enough heat around. Human flesh will start to suffer mild injury after one second at 65C but fires generate 10 times that, and go on getting hotter as oxygen supplies roar in. Fires under such circumstances accelerate with amazing speeds. At such temperatures, metals buckle and melt, stone chars and anything else bursts into flame. Polymers burn furiously at around 1200 C, releasing clouds of smoke also rich in combustible gases - and poisonous ones such as hydrogen cyanide. But the main killer in such cases is carbon monoxide. Even small quantities can begin to stupefy victims. Inhaled in large quantities, unconsciousness is followed swiftly by death. Identification of the dead promises to be exacting. Officials and Red Cross volunteers spent much of yesterday compiling the names of some 2,500 hotel guests and local skiers thought to have planned to ski Kitzsteinhorn on Saturday. As many of them returned to hotels or contacted helplines they were removed from the list of possible victims. Last night the number of Japanese victims fell from 17 to 10, after a party of missing Japanese who were on their way home were located. The number of Austrian victims stood at 52, Germans accounted for 42, and there were eight American citizens, two Slovenes, a Croat, and 40 people whose nationality is unknown. Bill McGuire, professor of geohazards at University College London, and a keen skier who has used the tunnel, said such tunnels were inherently dangerous. \"This is the in way of getting up the Alps these days. A lot of cable cars are being replaced by these things: they plunge through the mountains and take people up to 7,000 feet in a couple of minutes,\" he said.

      "body": "<p><strong> Tom Hammond - political director, CNN</strong> </p> <p> We have a great many regrets. We had many problems calling the race incorrectly and we're looking at why that happened. We were part of the conglomerate that commissioned the exit polls and like all the other American networks we trusted the data we were looking at and got it wrong not once, but twice. We all share responsibility for what happened and we're going to take a good look at precisely what went wrong. Once we've determined that, we're going to make sure that there's no opportunity for that to happen again. We're still going to use exit polls because we have a pretty good record of using them and we always compete to be first. We just have to compete even harder to be right. </p> <p> <strong> David Dimbleby - BBC1</strong> </p> <p> Luckily, we were not on the air when the American networks called the election for Bush, having finished at 6am English time. When we were on air, what I said when Florida was first given to Gore was: \"Florida has been called for Gore.\" I didn't say: \"We're calling it,\" so we were reporting second-hand what the American networks were saying. And we were very sceptical about it in the studio, saying this combination of exit polling and real votes is, at best, slightly dodgy. </p> <p>American elections are usually unbelievably boring to cover because nothing ever happens. But this time the emotion of it all came through to the studio guests who were swaying one way or another as the results came in. And Peter Snow's graphics were brilliant, so much better than the American networks'. Quite beautiful. </p> <p>I think the American channels found the whole thing extremely discomforting. Dan Rather's face was an absolute picture. He was virtually saying he regretted it all. In every way it was very enjoyable. Confusion is always attractive. It allows you to see where people really stand. I loved it. It was well worth doing. </p> <p> <strong> John Humphrys - Today</strong> </p> <p> I actually put it down to the fact that I wasn't there. I've covered five presidential elections and I decided I did not want to do anymore ever again because I got bored of them. I suspect that's why it went to pieces. The coincidence is considerable. But I can't say I wished I was there - of course it's exciting but it's also a shambles. As hacks we're all talking about and patronising the frightful American media, but the fact is we've done it ourselves, haven't we? It's a case of physician heal thyself. We all want to be the first to call things and we all use exit polls and sometimes they leave us with a great deal of egg on our faces, as has happened to the BBC in the past. We're all guilty. It wouldn't be a bad idea if we concentrated more on reporting what has happened and a wee bit less on anticipating what we believe is going to happen. But, of course, if we did that the Today programme would have difficulty filling its three hours every morning. </p> <p> <strong> Peter Snow - BBC1</strong> </p> <p> It was very exciting and dramatic. Although Gore was behind throughout most of it, it was clear he could jump ahead when we got to California and I hope I was making that point on the programme. But the other issue was, of course, whether we were getting the real results or not. We've always taken the network polls to be pretty reliable in the past. I don't remember any other cases of having to change states from one colour to another because they'd made a mistake. It has been a lesson for everybody - us as much as them. In future we have to wonder whether, even if the network is calling it in the states, should we call it too? Unless we have our people at every count - which would be a hugely expensive operation - how on earth do we know that they're getting their call right? </p> <p>The lesson for us this time is that we should explain to people in more detail precisely what we are reporting, which is essentially a forecast of a result. We need to alert the viewer to the possibility - which in this case turned out to be a fact - that this forecast could change. It's quite wrong to give a forecast until you're absolutely sure that it's right. We've learned to take them with a bit more than a pinch of salt next time. </p> <p> <strong> Jeremy Paxman - Newsnight</strong> </p> <p> The great slew of stuff happened after we were off the air, so I was watching all of the American channels. CNN seemed to do quite well. I don't know who was the first to start making the mistakes but all I can say is it's bad enough miscalling a state once. To miscall it twice is very, very unfortunate. I get the strong impression that the commercial pressure that they're under to be ahead of the game was certainly what led to them making such a big mistake. </p> <p> <strong> John Suchet - ITN</strong> </p> <p> I was on the ITN news channel and they had to prise me out of the chair because I just did not want to get up. It was the most exciting television news that I've been involved in since the outbreak of the Gulf War. The real star of our show was our Washington correspondent Tom Bradby. He just happened to walk past a TV with CBS on and heard out of half an ear that Florida was in doubt after all, and it may be that Bush hadn't won. He crashed onto the programme and half way through telling us it suddenly occurred to him he may have misheard it. He started saying, \"Well John, I'm beginning to wonder whether or not I did hear that and I can only say I hope I did, and I hope I'm getting it right.\" Well, he was getting it right. We must have had it on air within seconds of the Americans saying it was all in doubt because of Tom Bradby's alert one ear. </p> <p> <strong> Alec Russell - the Telegraph.</strong> </p> <p> We had \"Gore Captures Key State\" as one of our early headlines but the copy did say the election was still on a knife-edge despite that dramatic early twist. That went to print just after Florida had been recalled. It was a bit unfortunate, but there was nothing we could do. </p> <p>It was a superb night. It was almost like old-fashioned journalism again when front pages are being changed on a great running story. We had an edition that went at 5am so we weren't really that worried about the early editions because there was nothing you can do. When Florida was called it looked like a significant moment so we felt we had to make the point. In fact, when it was recalled it happened about five minutes before another edition went, so we breathed a huge sigh of relief - because then the final edition would have kept the fact that Gore was supposedly winning Florida. After that, two of us sort of staggered round the corner to the local hotel and slept from 5am until 8am before we started up again. </p> <p> <strong> Jon Snow - Channel 4 News</strong> </p> <p> I was chasing around in Washington DC between the Democrats and the Republicans and trying to find out what was going on but it was one of those moments when practical, on-the-ground journalism provided rather less than sitting in front of the television. But then sitting in front of the television provided considerable confusion. </p> <p>NBC had a brilliant guy called Tim Russert and his equipment was not any sort of computer console, but rather a piece of plasticised cardboard - a kind of rub-clean effort with a washable felt tip pen. He was doing sums all night and he was basically saying that it was all down to Florida. And, of course, he turned out to be right. I thought initially the thing was some kind of elaborate joke. That perhaps their computer had broken down. But as the night went on, the camera spent more and more time transmitting this extraordinary piece of cardboard and it turned out that he was the man of the night. </p> <p>But of course the thing was a shambles and is a lesson in not co-operating on exit polls. They all dived into the same dark hole of one wrong exit poll which it made it pretty difficult for the American consumer, let alone the British media, to follow. </p> <p> <strong> Edward Pilkington - the Guardian</strong> </p> <p> As editors, in our blood, the instinct was, how far can we go? Can we write \"Gore heading for the White House\"? As it happens, we were very fortunate to have Martin Kettle in Washington who had done a full list of all the states and who they would probably go to. By using that we realised that most of those states sweeping to Gore in the middle of the night were all on our checklist. So that dampened down our excitement which was very valuable because we decided to continue to be cautious and that's really how we managed to avoid any major embarrassments. We went with what we thought was certain and we'd been advised all through the night that Hillary was a certain win. It was a good decision that made us look more alive and focused than other papers. There was one very scary moment when the last edition had gone when the BBC swung over to the Hillary headquarters and said even that looked in doubt. We thought we were in trouble but our New York correspondent said that it was OK. As I was leaving the office and listening to the car radio, Lazio came on and gave his concession speech. That was a moment of relief. </p> <p> <strong> Mark Dowdney - the Mirror</strong> </p> <p> We had a nightmare because, like everyone else, we were misled by the early declaration of Florida for Gore. We were a bit suspicious of it even though all the American networks seemed sure. Both I and our US editor had advised extreme caution because it was so close beforehand, so we went with \"Al roaring\" as a headline. We didn't actually make a prediction for president and we were fortunate that there was a very, very strong home story that we could splash instead. </p> <p> <strong> Julia Somerville - ITN</strong> </p> <p> It was wonderful that we came out of the studio almost as ignorant as we went in several hours earlier. We reported that Gore had won Florida, but we credited the fact that it came from the networks. The highlight of the night for me, though, had to be Dan Rather saying: \"Mothers of America go wake up the children and bring them down into the living room because tonight, history is being made.\" Wonderful old ham. </p> <p> <strong> Nick Pollard - Sky News</strong> </p> <p> I think it's fair to say we were very much dependent on how the American networks interpreted the Voter News Service data. We followed their lead and reported when they called the states, but my view is that they were slow realising what the story was. One of the difficulties for all of us was that, when it was clear that the entire focus of attention was Florida, it was extremely difficult to get any coverage there. My overall sense of the American networks' coverage was that it was incredibly studio-bound. So in that sense, I have to say British television covered the whole thing a lot better.</p>",

Both I and our US editor had advised extreme caution because it was so close beforehand, so we went with \"Al roaring\" as a headline. We didn't actually make a prediction for president and we were fortunate that there was a very, very strong home story that we could splash instead. Julia Somerville - ITN It was wonderful that we came out of the studio almost as ignorant as we went in several hours earlier. We reported that Gore had won Florida, but we credited the fact that it came from the networks. The highlight of the night for me, though, had to be Dan Rather saying: \"Mothers of America go wake up the children and bring them down into the living room because tonight, history is being made.\" Wonderful old ham. Nick Pollard - Sky News I think it's fair to say we were very much dependent on how the American networks interpreted the Voter News Service data. We followed their lead and reported when they called the states, but my view is that they were slow realising what the story was. One of the difficulties for all of us was that, when it was clear that the entire focus of attention was Florida, it was extremely difficult to get any coverage there. My overall sense of the American networks' coverage was that it was incredibly studio-bound. So in that sense, I have to say British television covered the whole thing a lot better.",

      "body": "<p>What is the most asinine buzz phrase in television? A couple of years ago it would have been \"high quality\" - a term used indiscriminately and without definition to justify any programme or schedule. More recently \"dumbing down\" was top, itself an excruciatingly dumb accusation usually aimed at entertainment, which has always been a primary function of broadcasting. But now \"public service\" has sprinted up the charts. Its use and abuse are, at best, lazy and, at worst, dishonest. The forthcoming communications white paper has to grapple with what public service means in a multi-media age. </p> <p>So what is public service broadcasting? Is its name taken in vain when a politician who doesn't watch television at all insists news should be not just in primetime but bang in the middle of primetime? Or when documentary makers say Channel 4 and the BBC should commission more of their work as of right? How much credence should we give to the squeals of commercial broadcasters when BBC1 revamps to present a more competitive schedule, as it has done many times before? All these positions are completely self-serving. Public service broad casting, like Humpty Dumpty's speech to Alice, means whatever they want it to mean. </p> <p>An unnamed ITV executive was quoted last week as saying \"BBC1 had seven hours of public service broadcasting in weekday peak last year, whereas there wasn't a single PSB programme in the same period this year.\" This is, of course, ludicrous. When is a programme PSB and when is it not? My own company's series, Changing Rooms, was broadcast at the time. I like to imagine it is informative and entertaining. This matches the BBC's charter. So who is to say Changing Rooms is not public service? Obviously ITV would rather BBC1 did not compete so hard since it is the only other mass audience channel. But if ITV wants to clip its wings, with PSB obligations as the weapon, it will have to do better than this. </p> <p>It is time to insist on a rational approach, beginning with a truistic but useful definition of PSB: the publicly beneficial services we require broadcasters to supply in return for the privilege of the spectrum they occupy. These requirements are enforced by the government via regulators. That is all there is to it. So examples of the BBC's PSB responsibility are news and education; Channel 4 is required to provide specified amounts of multi-cultural programming; ITV must broadcast defined hours of regional programmes. We can argue that, say, the BBC's requirements should be wider, or better regulated. But it is dishonest merely to invent them as it suits. </p> <p>Perhaps the woolliest attitudes are revealed by those who hark back to the \"golden age\" of BBC1 when Kenneth Clark strode purposefully through the schedules. He had to because there was no other terrain. The idea of scheduling Civilisation in BBC1 peaktime now would be ridiculous and pointless when there is BBC2 and, shortly, BBC3 &amp; 4 to accommodate a whole range of programming. BBC1's job, albeit with a mixed schedule, is to remain one of our two mainstream channels with an entertainment-driven schedule. </p> <p>Michael Tracey has written a lament for the supposed golden age (The Decline and Fall of Public Service Broadcasting, OUP). He sets out eight distinguishing principles for PSB, including being universally available and universally appealing, not just to broad audiences but a range of minorities too. He also singles out a commitment to public education and independence from vested interests such as advertisers. Who could disagree with such a wish list? But on a practical level such objectives need to be defined as responsibilities of particular broadcasters. They can then meaningfully be referred to as public service programmes without the prejudice and inaccuracy that currently plagues the debate. </p> <p>The only useful definition of PSB is services we ask broadcasters to provide in return for the privilege of the spectrum they occupy. Broadcasters could, of course, merely be asked to pay for that privilege rather than taking on any PSB responsibilities. And all the resultant monies, along with the BBC's licence fee, could become a PSB fund for any programme makers and broadcasters to bid for. After 2006 the BBC will have to prove that it is the most beneficial way of providing the bulk of the PSB that we want.

      "bodyText": "What is the most asinine buzz phrase in television? A couple of years ago it would have been \"high quality\" - a term used indiscriminately and without definition to justify any programme or schedule. More recently \"dumbing down\" was top, itself an excruciatingly dumb accusation usually aimed at entertainment, which has always been a primary function of broadcasting. But now \"public service\" has sprinted up the charts. Its use and abuse are, at best, lazy and, at worst, dishonest. The forthcoming communications white paper has to grapple with what public service means in a multi-media age. So what is public service broadcasting? Is its name taken in vain when a politician who doesn't watch television at all insists news should be not just in primetime but bang in the middle of primetime? Or when documentary makers say Channel 4 and the BBC should commission more of their work as of right? How much credence should we give to the squeals of commercial broadcasters when BBC1 revamps to present a more competitive schedule, as it has done many times before? All these positions are completely self-serving. Public service broad casting, like Humpty Dumpty's speech to Alice, means whatever they want it to mean. An unnamed ITV executive was quoted last week as saying \"BBC1 had seven hours of public service broadcasting in weekday peak last year, whereas there wasn't a single PSB programme in the same period this year.\" This is, of course, ludicrous. When is a programme PSB and when is it not? My own company's series, Changing Rooms, was broadcast at the time. I like to imagine it is informative and entertaining. This matches the BBC's charter. So who is to say Changing Rooms is not public service? Obviously ITV would rather BBC1 did not compete so hard since it is the only other mass audience channel. But if ITV wants to clip its wings, with PSB obligations as the weapon, it will have to do better than this. It is time to insist on a rational approach, beginning with a truistic but useful definition of PSB: the publicly beneficial services we require broadcasters to supply in return for the privilege of the spectrum they occupy. These requirements are enforced by the government via regulators. That is all there is to it. So examples of the BBC's PSB responsibility are news and education; Channel 4 is required to provide specified amounts of multi-cultural programming; ITV must broadcast defined hours of regional programmes. We can argue that, say, the BBC's requirements should be wider, or better regulated. But it is dishonest merely to invent them as it suits. Perhaps the woolliest attitudes are revealed by those who hark back to the \"golden age\" of BBC1 when Kenneth Clark strode purposefully through the schedules. He had to because there was no other terrain. The idea of scheduling Civilisation in BBC1 peaktime now would be ridiculous and pointless when there is BBC2 and, shortly, BBC3 &amp; 4 to accommodate a whole range of programming. BBC1's job, albeit with a mixed schedule, is to remain one of our two mainstream channels with an entertainment-driven schedule. Michael Tracey has written a lament for the supposed golden age (The Decline and Fall of Public Service Broadcasting, OUP). He sets out eight distinguishing principles for PSB, including being universally available and universally appealing, not just to broad audiences but a range of minorities too. He also singles out a commitment to public education and independence from vested interests such as advertisers. Who could disagree with such a wish list? But on a practical level such objectives need to be defined as responsibilities of particular broadcasters. They can then meaningfully be referred to as public service programmes without the prejudice and inaccuracy that currently plagues the debate. The only useful definition of PSB is services we ask broadcasters to provide in return for the privilege of the spectrum they occupy. Broadcasters could, of course, merely be asked to pay for that privilege rather than taking on any PSB responsibilities. And all the resultant monies, along with the BBC's licence fee, could become a PSB fund for any programme makers and broadcasters to bid for. After 2006 the BBC will have to prove that it is the most beneficial way of providing the bulk of the PSB that we want. There are alternatives.

      "body": "<p>I was interviewed for my job shortly after graduating from Manchester University in the summer. As with so many jobs in new and old media, it was what I had done in my spare time at university rather than anything I had learned on my course that swung it. </p> <p>NUS was looking for someone with experience of writing and editing for students. I had worked part-time for three years on my college newspaper, Student Direct, doing exactly that. The valuable and transferable skills I had developed there, working against deadlines, proofreading messy copy, writing and devising snappy headlines, were suddenly able to command a salary. Crucially, I had also gained some web experience, having helped establish an online version of Student Direct. Largely on the strength of this, I got the job. </p> <p>There seems to be no clear or established route into new media jobs akin to the regional papers and broadcasters, traineeships and postgraduate courses that dominate entry into traditional media. Most schools of journalism now offer modules or whole qualifications in online journalism, but these are yet to produce a sufficient number of graduates to satisfy the considerable demand for labour of the ever-expanding web. </p> <p>The majority of these jobs have been taken by experienced media professionals who have transferred their skills, be it from television or print, to the net. But increasingly graduates will want to start their careers online and, similarly, websites will want to recruit directly from university or college. What is less clear is how they will do that.

      "bodyText": "I was interviewed for my job shortly after graduating from Manchester University in the summer. As with so many jobs in new and old media, it was what I had done in my spare time at university rather than anything I had learned on my course that swung it. NUS was looking for someone with experience of writing and editing for students. I had worked part-time for three years on my college newspaper, Student Direct, doing exactly that. The valuable and transferable skills I had developed there, working against deadlines, proofreading messy copy, writing and devising snappy headlines, were suddenly able to command a salary. Crucially, I had also gained some web experience, having helped establish an online version of Student Direct. Largely on the strength of this, I got the job. There seems to be no clear or established route into new media jobs akin to the regional papers and broadcasters, traineeships and postgraduate courses that dominate entry into traditional media. Most schools of journalism now offer modules or whole qualifications in online journalism, but these are yet to produce a sufficient number of graduates to satisfy the considerable demand for labour of the ever-expanding web. The majority of these jobs have been taken by experienced media professionals who have transferred their skills, be it from television or print, to the net. But increasingly graduates will want to start their careers online and, similarly, websites will want to recruit directly from university or college. What is less clear is how they will do that. Many, like me, might move quickly from amateur to professional journalism without any formal training. Others may take the route of a course to put themselves - expensively - ahead of the pack. However there are certain factors that give any web wanabee a clear headstart. Work experience, as with all media and indeed most professions, is vital.

When Jez, who had been attacked by Steve's father, found himself in the same hospital as his enemy, he tried to smother helpless Steve, but instead collapsed and died himself, with blood dripping from his mouth; it transpired a broken rib punctured his lung. </p> <p>In an implicit endorsement of the soap's place in a gentler Britain, four viewers complained that the scene was too violent for a family audience. The Independent Television Commission agreed. Yesterday it stated that Jez Quigley's character \"clearly enjoys inflicting pain\". Such depiction of violence was in breach of the programme code, it ruled. </p> <p>Granada, the show's maker, argued the scene should have been taken in the context of the storyline: the scene was menacing rather than violent, and viewers would have been prepared for the confrontation. </p> <p>However, the commission ruled \"menace may itself be an issue - up to this point Jez's character had injected some humour into this violent storyline\". Depicting Jez enjoying inflicting pain \"could be disturbing to younger children\".</p>",

      "bodyText": "Coronation Street, folk memory of a world long gone, has been criticised by the TV regulator for being sadistic. The episode in question, in September, had Jez Quigley trying to murder Steve McDonald for testifying against him. When Jez, who had been attacked by Steve's father, found himself in the same hospital as his enemy, he tried to smother helpless Steve, but instead collapsed and died himself, with blood dripping from his mouth; it transpired a broken rib punctured his lung. In an implicit endorsement of the soap's place in a gentler Britain, four viewers complained that the scene was too violent for a family audience. The Independent Television Commission agreed. Yesterday it stated that Jez Quigley's character \"clearly enjoys inflicting pain\". Such depiction of violence was in breach of the programme code, it ruled. Granada, the show's maker, argued the scene should have been taken in the context of the storyline: the scene was menacing rather than violent, and viewers would have been prepared for the confrontation. However, the commission ruled \"menace may itself be an issue - up to this point Jez's character had injected some humour into this violent storyline\". Depicting Jez enjoying inflicting pain \"could be disturbing to younger children\".",

His own Arab fighters take part in the battle at the frontline. No amount of US pressure is likely to persuade Mullah Omar to give up bin Laden. The Taliban may be medieval. They are certainly uncompromising. And they are often barbarous. But the uncomfortable reality for western policy makers is that they now control 95% of Afghanistan. With help from Pakistan, the US's erstwhile cold war ally, the Taliban are poised to complete their victory over the opposition led by General Ahmad Shah Masood, possibly as early as next summer. If Mr Bush or Mr Gore ever make it to the White House, they need to begin a robust but constructive dialogue with Afghanistan. The alternatives are far worse: the spread of jihad, and the spectre of an Islamic revolution in nuclear Pakistan.

Randall, who last week swiped the \"BBC business editor\" half of Jay's title, was once an impressionable 20-something aspiring hack who won an essay prize which took him to a rather grand party in Washington DC. There he was shepherded around the great and the good by a well-meaning professor who boomed, \"That's your ambassador over there, you must say hello.

The current affairs department was apparently livid that the Panorama team didn't produce the show, which was edited by the ratings-minded Mark \"Pops\" Popescu of the Six O'Clock News. A source at BBC newsgathering reveals the reason why the Panorama lot were reduced to merely a contributing role: \"They were too slow, too busy thinking about it while we got on and did it. And anyway, we've got all the waders.\" </p> <p>\u0095 The appointment of a chief executive for the ITV network looks as remote as ever. No progress has been made, despite the desperate bleatings of advertisers. In fact the whole thing has been pulled back for a rethink, says a relaxed Leslie Hill, network chairman.

And you can see why: it was back in March 1999 that Michael Jackson, who commissioned the Saturday Night Armistice at BBC2, proudly announced that he'd poached the team back, and in the spring channel high-ups were predicting a series this autumn; now the earliest one could appear is April. A record gestation period for comedy? </p> <p>\u0095 Radio 2 may be getting trendier, but the list of \"defining artists\" of the 70s, 80s and 90s who will top the playlist of its digital spin-off, Network Y, suggests uncertainty away from easy-listening territory. Among the defining artists of - presumably - the 70s are: the Beatles (disbanded 1970); the Beach Boys (effectively disbanded 1967); Jimi Hendrix (died 1970) and Janis Joplin (died 1970). Not classified as defining artists of any decade, on the other hand, are Madonna, Prince and Oasis. </p> <p>\u0095 Channel 4 is planning the second series of Big Brother, to be screened some time next year. One idea under consideration, apparently, is to start the show off with two houses and merge them later, just as Survivor! starts off with two tribes on a desert island who come together for the finale. One lot of insufferable egotists was bad enough, but some C4 execs are balking at the prospect of a double dose of Nasty Nicks. Meanwhile the channel has been boasting to its advertisers that the press frenzy over Big Brother 1 pulled in coverage worth \u00a315m if the same space had been bought for ads, and \"in excess of \u00a350m\" taking into account that it was editorial. Monkey is proud to note that the top four papers who contributed to this were the Sun, the Star, the Mirror and the Guardian. </p> <p>\u0095 CNN's London office went to great pains and expense last week with a glitzy US election night party in the River Room of the Savoy, providing champagne and canapes throughout the night for all those Brits not on the US Embassy guest list.

      "body": "<p>The sex business is clever. It helped establish VHS as the video format of the past 20 years. It relied on a silent yet enormous market for material, millions of enthusiasts who realised that a small machine in the living room meant they no longer had to hide projectors under the bed, or take the risk and creep into Soho clubs. </p> <p>Today, the same business is driving another revolution - the internet. The phenomenal demand for porn and the ease of access via the net has put the new young e-businesses that supply it at the forefront of a media revolution. The audience for adult material is computer literate - research by the Adult Channel in the UK shows that the rate of computer ownership is significantly higher for those who log on to their SXTV site than the national average. </p> <p>The epicentre of the development of adult material via the web is Amsterdam. When Channel 4 asked us to make a series about the liberal city, we saw first hand exactly how the sex industry is driving internet business expansion. It has been so successful that in as little as two years, pornography will have broken through the barriers of broadband technology, building on its current pre-eminence in ADSL and video on demand. </p> <p>While broadcasters in the UK scratch their heads and wonder where they fit in with this technological progress, young, dynamic companies such as Amsterdam's Interclimax, which we found and filmed behind the scenes for Channel 4, have solved the problems and are making big money. With more than 1m visits a day, the Interclimax site is an extraordinary commercial success, and adult channels in the UK are beginning to look at these businesses to see what lessons can be learned. </p> <p>When you walk into Interclimax in Amsterdam, it's like walking into a sexual Big Brother. Cameras are everywhere in the \"voyeur house\", including the toilets and under the receptionist's seat. Many of the girls live in and it feels like a 21st-century version of the Nevada brothel Nick Broomfield filmed in Chicken Ranch. </p> <p>Downstairs, 21 chat rooms are taking hits from punters 24 hours a day. The ambience recalls an upmarket facilities house in Soho, not a sex business. Interclimax pumps out movies on associated websites, and traffic on its main site (even with its stop-frame action) is building every day. Credit card details ripple through the screen as money is taken - it is porn chat and action on demand. One of its most valued employees is the wonderful Natasha, whose job is to spend all day every day digitising hardcore gay porn for transmission. Only in Amsterdam. </p> <p>But Interclimax's founder, ex-porn star Claudia Von Lubak, sees herself as running a media business that just happens to be about hardcore sex. \"We are constantly expanding and in two years we aim to float on the stock market with full support from Dutch banks. They don't care what we produce just as long as we make money,\" she says. </p> <p>In the meantime Interclimax is busy receiving 40m visits a month, producing its own porn films to be shown online and setting up a specialist porn and sports internet magazine to crack the vast Asian PC market. Many companies see Asia as a lucrative gap to be filled while other clients are tucked up in bed in the middle of the American or European night. </p> <p>The audience for adult material may not be vocal, but its characteristics and habits are one stage evolved from the average viewer. A combination of the arrival of the web and the growth of premium sports and movie channels is developing a pay-per-view culture in the UK, but in porn this is already well established. </p> <p>This audience is used to subscription and last-minute decisions. The Adult Channel describes its highly successful pay-per-night service as \"an impulse buy\". The sex business has cleverly realised that it has a product that people will seek out and buy, and the financial success this brings puts companies such as Interclimax at the forefront of media developments. </p> <p>Convergence, via broadband, will allow adult businesses to become broadcasters, driving ever-increasing traffic to sites and services which are all metered.

      "bodyText": "The sex business is clever. It helped establish VHS as the video format of the past 20 years. It relied on a silent yet enormous market for material, millions of enthusiasts who realised that a small machine in the living room meant they no longer had to hide projectors under the bed, or take the risk and creep into Soho clubs. Today, the same business is driving another revolution - the internet. The phenomenal demand for porn and the ease of access via the net has put the new young e-businesses that supply it at the forefront of a media revolution. The audience for adult material is computer literate - research by the Adult Channel in the UK shows that the rate of computer ownership is significantly higher for those who log on to their SXTV site than the national average. The epicentre of the development of adult material via the web is Amsterdam. When Channel 4 asked us to make a series about the liberal city, we saw first hand exactly how the sex industry is driving internet business expansion. It has been so successful that in as little as two years, pornography will have broken through the barriers of broadband technology, building on its current pre-eminence in ADSL and video on demand. While broadcasters in the UK scratch their heads and wonder where they fit in with this technological progress, young, dynamic companies such as Amsterdam's Interclimax, which we found and filmed behind the scenes for Channel 4, have solved the problems and are making big money. With more than 1m visits a day, the Interclimax site is an extraordinary commercial success, and adult channels in the UK are beginning to look at these businesses to see what lessons can be learned. When you walk into Interclimax in Amsterdam, it's like walking into a sexual Big Brother. Cameras are everywhere in the \"voyeur house\", including the toilets and under the receptionist's seat. Many of the girls live in and it feels like a 21st-century version of the Nevada brothel Nick Broomfield filmed in Chicken Ranch. Downstairs, 21 chat rooms are taking hits from punters 24 hours a day. The ambience recalls an upmarket facilities house in Soho, not a sex business. Interclimax pumps out movies on associated websites, and traffic on its main site (even with its stop-frame action) is building every day. Credit card details ripple through the screen as money is taken - it is porn chat and action on demand. One of its most valued employees is the wonderful Natasha, whose job is to spend all day every day digitising hardcore gay porn for transmission. Only in Amsterdam. But Interclimax's founder, ex-porn star Claudia Von Lubak, sees herself as running a media business that just happens to be about hardcore sex. \"We are constantly expanding and in two years we aim to float on the stock market with full support from Dutch banks. They don't care what we produce just as long as we make money,\" she says. In the meantime Interclimax is busy receiving 40m visits a month, producing its own porn films to be shown online and setting up a specialist porn and sports internet magazine to crack the vast Asian PC market. Many companies see Asia as a lucrative gap to be filled while other clients are tucked up in bed in the middle of the American or European night. The audience for adult material may not be vocal, but its characteristics and habits are one stage evolved from the average viewer. A combination of the arrival of the web and the growth of premium sports and movie channels is developing a pay-per-view culture in the UK, but in porn this is already well established. This audience is used to subscription and last-minute decisions. The Adult Channel describes its highly successful pay-per-night service as \"an impulse buy\". The sex business has cleverly realised that it has a product that people will seek out and buy, and the financial success this brings puts companies such as Interclimax at the forefront of media developments. Convergence, via broadband, will allow adult businesses to become broadcasters, driving ever-increasing traffic to sites and services which are all metered. The UK audience is becoming far more tolerant and interested in hardcore material and now has the means to purchase it discreetly and at a low cost.

      "body": "<p>Today, world leaders are meeting in the Hague to discuss climate change and what - if anything - can be done to combat global warming. Their discussions will be full of abstractions about \"carbon trading\" and \"flexible mechanisms\". But for many us here, the issue has suddenly become far from abstract. Extreme weather conditions have brought home the fact that our climate is changing - and changing fast. It may be easy to be fatalistic about it, but the truth is that although we humans have caused the problem, we also have the solution. \"Think global and act local,\" said Friends of the Earth founder David Bower, who died last week. In many small but important ways we can make a difference. Here are my top tips for how to begin: </p> <p> <strong> 1 Count your food miles</strong> </p> <p> What you eat and where you buy it affects global emissions. Pollution from transport is the fastest growing source of carbon dioxide emissions, so it is madness to fly out-of-season vegetables across the world to supermarkets. Supermarket treatment of British food is also absurd; centralised distribution means food is taken miles by lorry to another area, often returning back to the starting point. We should lobby supermarkets for a system of classifying food according to the distance travelled: 0 for local food, 1 for British, 2 for Europe, and 3 for intercontinental. Better still, we should shop at farmers' markets. Local growers get more money: less transportation means less pollution. Ideally, says Sustain, \"You should also buy organic, not just for health reasons but because it is sustainably produced. It avoids conventional pesticides which are petro-chemically based, and it uses more human labour which is renewable energy.\" </p> <p> <strong> 2 Airmiles: no smiles</strong> </p> <p> By 2020, there will be 1.56bn tourists, double the current numbers. We should think about the impact of our own journeys. Are there alternatives to flying? Could we manage without hiring a car? How can we conserve energy in our host country (other than sleeping by the pool all day)? The Association of British Travel Agents found 85% of British tourists on package holidays believe it is important not to damage the environment. But the vast majority don't do anything: only 18% said they switched off air-conditioning in hotels to save energy, only 17% said they ask for towels not to be washed daily. </p> <p> <strong> 3 Recycle this newspaper</strong> </p> <p> Use the recycling bin. Astonishingly, the UK still only recycles between 8% and 9% of everything that can be recycled. Newspapers, magazines and notepaper make up 30% of household rubbish. Waste disposal is a major contributor to greenhouse gasses. Even better, avoid buying things you don't really want, and shun unnecessary packaging. What better time to start than in the run-up to Christmas. \"Making things to throw away uses up natural resources and wastes energy,\" says the Women's Environmental Network, \"only buy what you need. Buy goods that are durable, that have components which can be re-used or recycled.\" </p> <p> <strong> 4 Turn off anything that winks at you</strong> </p> <p> A video recorder on standby uses almost as much electricity as one playing a tape. Small changes in small habits make big differences. Turning down the thermostat by one degree, not leaving TV and music centres on standby, turning off lights, putting lids on cooking pots, and only half-filling kettles can cut energy consumption by 30%, saving you money as well as saving the planet, as they used to say in more innocent times. </p> <p> <strong> 5 Buy your electricity at the windfarm</strong> </p> <p> This is one the door-to-door power sales sharks won't offer you, but you can buy green energy if you ask. Many suppliers now offer it. For some suppliers it means investing in the development of renewable energy technology, such as wind power. Others pledge to use energy from existing renewable energy supplies, putting into their supplies green electricity to match the amount used by green consumers. Future Energy runs an accreditation scheme to check suppliers are as green as they claim. Friends of the Earth will soon publish a green league table so you can compare suppliers. So far only 16,000 have signed up, significantly less than in green-conscious Germany and Holland. If 1m chose green energy in the UK, 5% of our power supplies would be renewable, considerably reducing harmful emissions. </p> <p> <strong> 6 Do the obvious: lag the loft</strong> </p> <p> We all know about saving energy in the home, don't we? In reality only 1.4% of the population has bought energy-efficient white goods such as dishwashers or washing machines even though 50% claim they have, according to a survey by WWF and Energy Saving Trust released today. One quarter of the UK's overall carbon dioxide emissions come from our homes but less has been done to reduce pollution from this area than any other. Each house emits six tonnes of carbon dioxide every year, more than the average car. Simple improvements, such as lagging the loft, fitting double-glazing and using low-energy light bulbs make a huge difference. People know about these but are surprisingly ignorant about other things they can do. When you buy new appliances, look for the European Union eco-symbol: energy-efficient appliances use 25% less energy than ordinary ones. </p> <p> <strong> 7 Let the worms do the work</strong> </p> <p> Half of all our waste is biodegradable. Buy a kitchen compost bin; it can save as much as a ton of rubbish per household per year. You can even help the process. Women's Environmental Network's home composting guide says: \"Wee on it - the nitrogen accelerates the process.\" To take this to its logical conclusion, arrange a natural burial for yourself or a loved one. Green Burials offers the woodland coffin which comes flat packed and can be assembled in 10 minutes. It is ideal for a woodland burial. </p> <p> <strong> 8 Leave the rainforest where it is</strong> </p> <p> Check all wooden furniture and timber comes from sustainable sources. Rainforests may not be the fashionable symbolic cause they once were, but they are still the planet's lungs. Their products pop up all over the place. WWF says the only guarantee that timber comes from forests which are socially and environmentally well-managed is Forestry Stewardship Council approval. Only buy wood with the FSC symbol. </p> <p> <strong> 9 Just stop using petrol</strong> </p> <p> Yes you can, and the car industry may (eventually) help you. Hydrogen-powered cars are loved by car designers and could become a reality in about 10 years. Meanwhile, consider converting to liquified petroleum gas (LPG). You won't be alone: a new pump for this is opening every day. Visit the Powershift website to find out how. Meanwhile, you can cut down on conventional petrol use just by changing driving habits - the one positive lesson that can be learned from the fuel protests: no rapid acceleration, lower speeds, keeping tires at the right pressure. Join the Environmental Transport Association. It offers all the services of the AA and RAC, but is not part of the road lobby. </p> <p> <strong> 10 Well, you can always walk</strong> </p> <p> Or cycle. The majority of car journeys are less than five miles and, honestly, once you've stepped out, you'll find it's really not that bad. The only energy used is your own and that's healthy. You only have to look at the collective girths of the people's fuel lobby to know this makes sense. </p> <p>These changes will save you money which you should invest in an ethical saving account. They are profitable and they put the pressure on business to clean up its act. </p> <p> Contact Energy Efficiency Hotline 0345 277 200 </p> <p> <strong>Useful links</strong><br> Friends of the Earth's website: <a href=\"http://www.foe.org.uk\">www.foe.org.uk</a> <br>World Wide Fund for Nature's website: <a href=\"http://www.panda.org\">www.panda.org</a> <br>Women's Environmental Network website: <a href=\"http://www.wen.org.uk\">www.wen.org.uk</a> <br> Energy Savings Trust's website: <a href=\"http://www.est-powershift.org.uk\">www.est-powershift.org.uk</a> and <a href=\"http://www.saveenergy.co.uk\">www.saveenergy.co.uk</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>British Airways is virtually certain to fly Concorde alone if the investigation into the Air France crash drags on indefinitely, Whitehall sources confirmed last night.</p> <p>On the eve of an Anglo-French meeting in Paris to examine progress on the accident investigation, the sources backed BA's view that Concorde will fly again as soon as possible.</p> <p>The remaining stumbling block is the reissuing of the plane's certificate of airworthiness by the civil aviation authority. The certificate was withdrawn pending a CAA inquiry into possible flaws in Concorde's fuel tanks. According to a preliminary report by investigators into the Air France Concorde crash near Paris in July, in which 113 people died, the fuel tanks could have been hit by debris from the tyres or the runway.</p> <p>The Whitehall sources said BA had wanted to await the outcome of the French investigation and relaunch Concorde at the same time as Air France. But if the French inquiry goes on for months, BA may act by itself.</p> <p>BA has been cooperating with the CAA and the aerospace industry in producing a modification to the design to protect the fuel tanks.</p> <p>Reports from within the industry suggest that the British inquiry is almost complete, and that its findings will satisfy the CAA.

      "bodyText": "British Airways is virtually certain to fly Concorde alone if the investigation into the Air France crash drags on indefinitely, Whitehall sources confirmed last night. On the eve of an Anglo-French meeting in Paris to examine progress on the accident investigation, the sources backed BA's view that Concorde will fly again as soon as possible. The remaining stumbling block is the reissuing of the plane's certificate of airworthiness by the civil aviation authority. The certificate was withdrawn pending a CAA inquiry into possible flaws in Concorde's fuel tanks. According to a preliminary report by investigators into the Air France Concorde crash near Paris in July, in which 113 people died, the fuel tanks could have been hit by debris from the tyres or the runway. The Whitehall sources said BA had wanted to await the outcome of the French investigation and relaunch Concorde at the same time as Air France. But if the French inquiry goes on for months, BA may act by itself. BA has been cooperating with the CAA and the aerospace industry in producing a modification to the design to protect the fuel tanks. Reports from within the industry suggest that the British inquiry is almost complete, and that its findings will satisfy the CAA. A certificate of airworthiness for BA's seven Concordes, it is said, would then be a formality. BA's service between Heathrow and New York could restart by the summer. BA has continued to pay its Concorde staff of 200 and pilots are being kept fully trained. The crash has raised doubts about how long BA can continue to fly Concorde, even though the Air France disaster was the first in Concorde's 25 year history. The original plan was to fly it beyond the end of the decade, but it seems likely that it will have to be withdrawn from commercial service before then.",

      "body": "<p>In a secret location in London a team of internet investigators surf the net hunting for sites that publish pirated software. Fed with leads from emails, a phone hotline and tip-offs from industry sources the Business Software Alliance works to stem the flow of unlicensed software online. </p> <p>\"We keep the location a secret to protect our staff from reprisals by angry pirates,\" says Margo Miller, head of the BSA's European enforcement unit. </p> <p>The web is the latest battlefield in a piracy war which, the BSA estimates, last year alone cost the software industry worldwide \u00a37bn in missed revenue. </p> <p>\"In the UK 26% of new business software installed last year was illegal,\" says Miller. \"That's one in every four computers running a complete suite of pirated programs.\" </p> <p>And that is before the figures for games and non-business software are factored in. Industry insiders estimate the total amount of illicit software installed stands closer to 35%. </p> <p>The BSA's sponsoring partners include Adobe, Macromedia, Microsoft and Symantec. \"If you take that figure of 35%, then we missed out on $50m in sales last year,\" says Sue Thexton, vice-president of Macromedia Europe. </p> <p>\"All that could have gone towards research and development costs.\" </p> <p>Miller says: \"Every single software product you can think of is available somewhere illegally on the internet. You can get everything from direct program downloads, serial numbers and cracked software, to compilation CDs put together by professional racketeers who sell pirate software through online stores and in auction sites.\" </p> <p>In the past three months Miller's team sent out 846 \"cease and desist\" warnings to ISPs (internet service providers), 91% of which lead to the closure of offending web sites. Online auction sites are a particular problem - BSA investigators found over 80% of software sold there was illicit. </p> <p>On the web, professional fraudsters run only a small portion of the pirate software, or \"warez\", sites. Most sites are \"not-for-profit\", run as a service for friends. \"We find many warez sites are run by teenagers,\" says Miller. </p> <p>Dan, a 15-year-old schoolboy from Alberta, Canada, recently set up a site offering everything from the latest version of Microsoft Office, to the graphics package Adobe PhotoShop and scores of PC games. </p> <p><strong> Pornography</strong><br> </p> <p> \"Lots of warez sites are full of pornography and dead links. I wanted to create a site where you could find what you wanted quickly without having to click through tens of ads,\" he says. Dan uses one of the big free online US sites to host the illicit files. \"That way it's easier to set up again if someone closes you down. I don't see I'm doing any harm. The people who use this software usually can't afford the real thing anyway, like students. No one is losing anything.\" </p> <p>Miller sees things differently. \"I think we perhaps should make an example of one of these kids to send a message that piracy is illegal in every form.\" </p> <p>Steve Keyser, owner of Tera-byte, the ISP that hosts Dan's web site, can't see what the fuss is all about: \"If you follow through half the warez links I think you'll usually find there's nothing at the end, just endless ads. And the software you do find probably doesn't work, or might well have a virus in it. You'd be a fool to use pirate software.\" </p> <p>Yet millions of people do. For the BSA and ISPs alike the problem is that as soon as one site is shut down another will pop up under a different name or on another ISP. Type \"warez\" into any search engine and the list of matching sites will run to hundreds of thousands. With a little persistence you will find what you want. </p> <p>Though most ISPs co-operate with the BSA, there is a hard-core of defiant companies which ignore the organisation's demands. Miller suspects these are probably run by pirates themselves. \"In the UK alone there are three ISPs who have not complied with our repeat warnings. We are considering legal action if they do not come into line soon,\" she says. </p> <p>Mike Newton, who lobbies the European parliament for the BSA, says: \"ISPs should take responsibility for what is on their servers. We will be publishing guidelines for ISPs in a few months. But there's no use tackling this just in Europe. It is a global problem and we have to have global laws.\" </p> <p>The BSA has announced a reward of up to \u00a310,000 for information on organisations using illegal software. Meanwhile, Microsoft is taking matters into its own hands. The company announced a truce to anyone using pirated software: \"It's not an amnesty,\" explains Julia Phillpot, Microsoft UK's anti-piracy manager. </p> <p>\"If you've bought a packaged copy of a Microsoft product that looks like the real thing and you have proof of purchase we will swap the package for one authentic unit.\" The aim is to build up evidence of professional pirate traders to help with future legal action against them. </p> <p>Microsoft is installing anti-piracy precautions in its next release of Office. \"We have built in what we call the Office Automation Wizard,\" says Phillpot. \"It's an online registration system that is very hard to break. If, after 50 uses, you don't register your new software then the program will lock up until you do.\" </p> <p>But with the imminent introduction of broadband internet access, and the increased popularity of file-sharing systems like Napster, Hotline, Gnutella and Freenet, downloading pirated software from the net will soon be as quick and easy as sending an email. </p> <p>Laurence Westwood, chief investigator at the Foundation Against Software Theft, admits the situation is going to get much, much worse: \"With the introduction of these file sharing systems and as bandwidth increases we're going to have a very big headache.\" </p> <p><strong> Robin Hood</strong><br> </p> <p> For Nick, a London music producer in his late twenties, the rise of online piracy is inevitable: \"I've long used Hotline (an ancestor of Napster) to get all my software.

      "bodyText": "In a secret location in London a team of internet investigators surf the net hunting for sites that publish pirated software. Fed with leads from emails, a phone hotline and tip-offs from industry sources the Business Software Alliance works to stem the flow of unlicensed software online. \"We keep the location a secret to protect our staff from reprisals by angry pirates,\" says Margo Miller, head of the BSA's European enforcement unit. The web is the latest battlefield in a piracy war which, the BSA estimates, last year alone cost the software industry worldwide \u00a37bn in missed revenue. \"In the UK 26% of new business software installed last year was illegal,\" says Miller. \"That's one in every four computers running a complete suite of pirated programs.\" And that is before the figures for games and non-business software are factored in. Industry insiders estimate the total amount of illicit software installed stands closer to 35%. The BSA's sponsoring partners include Adobe, Macromedia, Microsoft and Symantec. \"If you take that figure of 35%, then we missed out on $50m in sales last year,\" says Sue Thexton, vice-president of Macromedia Europe. \"All that could have gone towards research and development costs.\" Miller says: \"Every single software product you can think of is available somewhere illegally on the internet. You can get everything from direct program downloads, serial numbers and cracked software, to compilation CDs put together by professional racketeers who sell pirate software through online stores and in auction sites.\" In the past three months Miller's team sent out 846 \"cease and desist\" warnings to ISPs (internet service providers), 91% of which lead to the closure of offending web sites. Online auction sites are a particular problem - BSA investigators found over 80% of software sold there was illicit. On the web, professional fraudsters run only a small portion of the pirate software, or \"warez\", sites. Most sites are \"not-for-profit\", run as a service for friends. \"We find many warez sites are run by teenagers,\" says Miller. Dan, a 15-year-old schoolboy from Alberta, Canada, recently set up a site offering everything from the latest version of Microsoft Office, to the graphics package Adobe PhotoShop and scores of PC games. Pornography \"Lots of warez sites are full of pornography and dead links. I wanted to create a site where you could find what you wanted quickly without having to click through tens of ads,\" he says. Dan uses one of the big free online US sites to host the illicit files. \"That way it's easier to set up again if someone closes you down. I don't see I'm doing any harm. The people who use this software usually can't afford the real thing anyway, like students. No one is losing anything.\" Miller sees things differently. \"I think we perhaps should make an example of one of these kids to send a message that piracy is illegal in every form.\" Steve Keyser, owner of Tera-byte, the ISP that hosts Dan's web site, can't see what the fuss is all about: \"If you follow through half the warez links I think you'll usually find there's nothing at the end, just endless ads. And the software you do find probably doesn't work, or might well have a virus in it. You'd be a fool to use pirate software.\" Yet millions of people do. For the BSA and ISPs alike the problem is that as soon as one site is shut down another will pop up under a different name or on another ISP. Type \"warez\" into any search engine and the list of matching sites will run to hundreds of thousands. With a little persistence you will find what you want. Though most ISPs co-operate with the BSA, there is a hard-core of defiant companies which ignore the organisation's demands. Miller suspects these are probably run by pirates themselves. \"In the UK alone there are three ISPs who have not complied with our repeat warnings. We are considering legal action if they do not come into line soon,\" she says. Mike Newton, who lobbies the European parliament for the BSA, says: \"ISPs should take responsibility for what is on their servers. We will be publishing guidelines for ISPs in a few months. But there's no use tackling this just in Europe. It is a global problem and we have to have global laws.\" The BSA has announced a reward of up to \u00a310,000 for information on organisations using illegal software. Meanwhile, Microsoft is taking matters into its own hands. The company announced a truce to anyone using pirated software: \"It's not an amnesty,\" explains Julia Phillpot, Microsoft UK's anti-piracy manager. \"If you've bought a packaged copy of a Microsoft product that looks like the real thing and you have proof of purchase we will swap the package for one authentic unit.\" The aim is to build up evidence of professional pirate traders to help with future legal action against them. Microsoft is installing anti-piracy precautions in its next release of Office. \"We have built in what we call the Office Automation Wizard,\" says Phillpot. \"It's an online registration system that is very hard to break. If, after 50 uses, you don't register your new software then the program will lock up until you do.\" But with the imminent introduction of broadband internet access, and the increased popularity of file-sharing systems like Napster, Hotline, Gnutella and Freenet, downloading pirated software from the net will soon be as quick and easy as sending an email. Laurence Westwood, chief investigator at the Foundation Against Software Theft, admits the situation is going to get much, much worse: \"With the introduction of these file sharing systems and as bandwidth increases we're going to have a very big headache.\" Robin Hood For Nick, a London music producer in his late twenties, the rise of online piracy is inevitable: \"I've long used Hotline (an ancestor of Napster) to get all my software. I've downloaded thousands of pounds worth to my machine. It's just a way of life, and once the download speeds increase I'm sure everyone will be doing it.\" For others getting software free is a matter of Robin Hood-like pride: \"I never pay for software if I can help it,\" says Bill, a web designer. \"The industry is rich enough as it is, and the corporations pay more than enough for their software licences. Most people can't afford it anyway, why should they start paying now?\" Meanwhile Miller and her minions will keep on hunting. But the smart money would be wise to think of a business model that avoids piracy altogether, rather than try to fight the flood.",

      "bodyText": "A high court judge will be asked today on behalf of the two killers of James Bulger, who are now 18, to extend the bar on the media publishing information on them when they get out of jail. If they succeed, they will create case law that could open the door for Myra Hindley, Rosemary West and other killers to assume new identities protected from disclosure on their release. Lawyers for Jon Venables and Robert Thompson will ask Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, president of the high court's family division, to extend a temporary ban on publicity, even though they have passed their 18th birthdays. There is no precedent in English law for a blanket ban on publication to protect a childhood killer who subsequently reaches adulthood. An injunction protecting Mary Bell, who was convicted in 1968 for killing two small children when she was aged 11, was in fact granted to protect her daughter; the latter was made a ward of court for the purpose, and her protection will lapse in a few years' time when she reaches 18. If Thompson and Venables win their case, she will be able to apply for a publicity ban in her own right. Dame Elizabeth granted the two a temporary injunction in July, just before they turned 18 in August. She decided it would be unfair to make a final decision without hearing full argument \"on the difficult issues, raising points so far untouched in English law which will be likely to affect other cases\". In a three-day hearing that starts today, lawyers for four newspaper groups, led by News Group Newspapers, will argue against the injunction. Lawyers for the home secretary, the attorney general and the official solicitor will endorse the plea by Thompson and Venables that the ban should be extended. Lawyers predict that the pair will succeed, though the case could go as far as the House of Lords. They were boys of 10 when they abducted the two-year-old and battered him to death on a railway line in Liverpool in February 1993. Last month Lord Woolf, the lord chief justice, recommended that their tariff - the minimum term in prison required for retribution and deterrence - should expire immediately. They could be released on licence as early as February, with new identities to facilitate their reintegration into society. Their lawyers argue that this would be endangered if the media were free to publish pictures of them or details about their new lives. The case will be the first important test of how the English courts will weigh up the competing rights of privacy and freedom of expression since the Human Rights Act came into force last month. The act incorporated the European convention on human rights into British law - making its guarantees, including privacy and free speech rights, enforceable in UK courts. Venables's QC, Edward Fitzgerald (who also acts for Hindley), will argue that the young men's right to a private life, and the restriction on the right of free speech that prevents the disclosure of information received in confidence, entitle them to an injunction. A further argument, backed by the home secretary and the attorney general, is that there is a statutory right to rehabilitation, continuing after release on licence, and this would be defeated by allowing publicity. Mr Fitzgerald won a ruling last year from three appeal court judges, headed by Lord Woolf, which will give strength to this argument. In a case brought by Broadmoor special hospital to try to stop publication of a book by a schizophrenic patient, the judges ruled that courts can grant injunctions to prevent interference with the performance by public bodies of their public responsibilities.",

      "bodyText": "A bizarre hijacking operation, in which a Russian domestic flight diverted in the middle of the night from its route to Moscow to an airfield in the Israeli desert, was peacefully resolved yesterday with the surrender of the man responsible. No one was able to explain why the lone hijacker had undertaken the highly dangerous operation, which swept 58 passengers and crew thousands of miles across the world in an ageing Russian Tupolev 154, running critically low on fuel. Israeli officials described the man - believed to be a Chechen national carrying a fake bomb - as \"disturbed\" and said his demands had been wildly contradictory, rambling and incoherent. All of the crew and passengers - most of them Dagestani football fans who had been hoping to see their team play in Moscow -left the Vnukovo Airlines plane unharmed, after the hijacker gave himself up to Israeli security forces. Nevertheless, that the incident occurred at all threatened to prove embarrassing for the Russian security forces and an investigation was expected. The aircraft took off from Makhachkala, the capital of Dagestan, which borders Chechnya to the east, where security measures have been placed on high alert since the start of Russia's campaign in the region last year. The Dagestani finance minister was travelling on the plane, accompanied by four armed bodyguards from the Russian security force, the FSB. The hijacker, who was unarmed, is understood to have persuaded them to hand over their weapons. At first it was believed that the hijack was an attempt to bring the Chechen rebels' cause to the world's attention, but later there was confusion over what had motivated the hijacker to start threatening to blow up the plane unless the pilot diverted to Israel. Israeli officials said he had initially declared he was supporting the Palestinians in their continuing uprising against Israel, but subsequently claimed to be backing the Chechens' campaign for independence from Russia. Later he produced video and audio tapes, and two letters - one addressed to the \"emperor of Japan\" - warning of a conspiracy for world dominance by the Japanese. During negotiations, the hijacker said he had been sent by his father to pass on a message \"to the world and the emperor of Japan\"; he had been instructed to deliver the two letters which \"warned the world about the yellow race taking control of the white race,\" according to the chief of the Israeli army's southern command, Major General Yomtov Samia. Gen Samia described the statements and the letters as \"a load of nonsense, which indicate the mental condition of the writer and of the hijacker\". A Russian embassy official, who travelled to the military base in the southern Negev desert where the plane had landed, agreed that the hijacker \"needs a psychiatric examination\". Confusion deepened when a Dagestani official tentatively identified the hijacker as Zagir Guseinov, a Chechen national living in Dagestan, who had a previous criminal record and was \"an active member of extremist organisations\". Israeli sources said the man was called Amarchenov Avmerchan, but gave no further details. The crisis began late on Saturday night, soon after the plane had taken off from Dagestan. Initially, the hijacker demanded that the aircraft fly to Tel Aviv, but permission was refused and the plane was directed to the desert airfield. The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, was travelling to the US for talks on how to end recent Israeli-Palestinian violence at the time of the hijack. His plane changed direction twice as Mr Barak decided to return to Israel to help resolve the crisis, then decided to press ahead to Washington when the hijacker surrendered.",

      "body": "<p>'They say some bosses are closer to their secretary than to their wife - and at times it really felt like that with John,\" says Claire Trattles, who worked for five years as PA to the finance director of a publishing company. \"We spent so much time together; and if he was out, we'd speak on the phone three or four times a day. I knew his favourite places for lunch, what he thought of all his clients, what perfume to buy for his wife. He had a very happy marriage, as I did, but our relationship was so comfortable. He could be stroppy at times, but so could I. Everything was very equal.\" </p> <p>The happy state of affairs came to an abrupt end when Trattles' boss announced he was taking early retirement. \"I was horrified,\" she admits. \"I guess I thought things would just continue the same way. The worst of it was that, because he wasn't going to another job, I couldn't move with him. I was really upset, and when the new candidate was appointed, I couldn't help comparing him constantly with John.\" </p> <p>This, according to business psychologist Charles Kay, is a serious error. \"It can be hard to lose someone with whom you've had a close working relationship, but once that person has left the company you have to move on,\" he says. \"If you try to compare a person you don't know with someone you have worked with for years, they are invariably going to come off worse. It's imperative to give the new person time to settle in, and allow time for you to get to know them.\" </p> <p>\"It's getting easier, slowly,\" admits Trattles, \"but it's a totally different sort of relationship. He's incredibly pernickety - he wants to see and sign everything and I feel almost as though I've been demoted. Logically, I know that he's new to the job and he just wants to ensure that everything is running smoothly, but I can't help resenting his manner - it's like he's constantly behind me, looking over my shoulder.\" </p> <p>In many ways, it is inevitable that a new boss will bring his or her own ideas and methods of working, but if these seem to be changing the PA's role, it is important to try to address the problem. </p> <p>\"It's not uncommon for a secretary or PA to come to see me if they have a new boss,\" says Martine Morgan, human resources director for a large consulting firm. \"They may feel that they have lost some of their areas of responsibility, or that the new manager doesn't have the same trust in their abilities. It can be quite an insulting feeling and it does make people resentful. </p> <p>\"We advise them to talk about it with their manager, to say that they feel they are capable of more. It may be that the new manager hasn't realised the PA's competency and is simply working the way they did with their previous secretary.\" </p> <p>Sometimes, however, a new boss can be like a breath of fresh air. \"When my boss left I was quite relieved,\" says Jeanne Wade, who works in a large IT firm. \"David was a really nice guy but he was totally disorganised. He was always forgetting meetings or lunches, he'd lose memos or forget he'd sent letters out, and blame me. It was never meant nastily, but whatever structures or administrative systems I tried to put in place never worked.\" </p> <p>When a new boss was appointed, Wade took the opportunity to change the way she worked. \"I was determined to present it as if things had always been this way,\" she says. \"I made up whereabouts sheets, got a second desk diary so that I could have my own for him, pencilled in a weekly time for him to have a meeting with me. I was determined to try to take control of how things would be done from an administrative perspective, and make it seem that this was how I'd always done things.\" </p> <p>\"Close relationships at work are very positive, but they also mean things can get stuck in a rut,\" says Kay. \"If you get on well with someone, and work comfortably together, it can be very difficult to instigate change. But when a new person joins, it can be a fresh start - there is no history between the two of you and it's a chance to streamline your working methods. </p> <p>\"Think about your old manager and rather than just thinking about how wonderful he was, try to remember what annoyed you about him, what made your working life difficult. Then put in place structures to ensure that it doesn't happen with the new boss. Try to concentrate on what you may have gained, rather that what you have lost.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>By the age of 26, Jo Bareham found that her career had reached an impasse. At the time, she was working in the compliance department of a bank, doing the administrative work necessary to keep the bank on the right side of the financial regulations. She wanted to progress, but when she tried to change jobs she encountered a familiar problem. \"The banking agencies wouldn't consider me because I was a secretary,\" she says. \"And the secretarial agencies weren't listening to what I wanted.\" </p> <p>Then, on her trip round the agencies, it was suggested to her that she should consider a career on the other side of the interview desk. It was not an idea that would have occurred to her, although her CV included a short spell in a human resources department. The change of career was a risk - even her parents voiced doubts on the matter - but four and a half years later she is happy she made the switch. </p> <p>In case you have ever wondered where recruitment consultants come from, Bareham's story is far from unique. About a quarter of her colleagues at Joslin Rowe, where she began her new career and where she still works, have secretarial experience. Bareham herself would never consider working in any other field of recruitment. Having been there herself, she knows how secretaries feel. \"I can understand their frustration,\" she explains. </p> <p>She is also in a position to understand how and why secretaries all too frequently fail to exploit their potential. It is well known that most secretaries hope that their current jobs will prove a stepping stone to something else. Over on the recruitment side of the desk, there is wide agreement that these hopes are well-founded. </p> <p>\"Secretarial skills are highly transferable,\" says one recruitment consultant at Maine-Tucker who also made the jump from secretary to her current position. She should know, having joined a recruitment consultancy as office manager with a view to forging a career in recruitment. The job appealed to her, she says, because \"it uses such a wide variety of skills\". But she also liked \"the autonomy, being in charge of your own desk.\" </p> <p>For Bareham, this new independence was the scariest element of the change. She found it easy to establish rapport with her candidates, but going out to sell herself to potential clients was initially intimidating. </p> <p>Of course, making the jump is far easier if you know where you want to land. For many secretaries, the problem is that they feel they could do more, but have no idea where they want to go. In which case, says the consultant at Maine-Tucker, they should cast the net wider and be more open-minded about where they work. </p> <p>Mark Rodgerson, head of the secretarial division at secretarial re-cruitment consultancy Zarak Hay, cites the case of an ambitious secretary who was committed to banking. He persuaded her to try a job in a shipping firm. In a comparatively short time she was promoted to partner. </p> <p>Nevertheless, a certain amount of of pessimism can creep in. Sally, who is almost 30, is a secretary at a firm of surveyors and utterly miserable in her job. She would like to move on, but, she says, \"this is all I know how to do\". </p> <p>With the benefit of a view from both sides of the interview desk, how would the PAs-cum-consultants steer secretaries towards improving their job and career prospects? According to Bareham, there is one common flaw in CVs which can be easily amended - provided the candidate is prepared to invest the time. \"Education is very important, especially as far as the banks are concerned,\" she says. \"I often find myself advising a candidate to go to college part-time and improve their grades, especially if they are young.\" </p> <p>Education aside, there are other influences at work, not of all of them fair. Personality is a big factor. Bareham confesses: \"I have had candidates with weak CVs but marvellous personalities, which is great. I can send them out straightaway.\" </p> <p>Personality is difficult to change, but the answer to the problem is to match the personality to the job. \"Loud people don't go down very well in back office jobs, such as compliance,\" says Bareham, \"and quiet types should stay away from the trading floor.\" </p> <p>A degree of unfairness is unavoidable in the secretarial job market, however, which is why you need a recuitment consultant on your side. A similar administrative position will pay \u00a325,000 in one bank and \u00a318,000 in another for no particular reason. Moreover, some people underestimate their own potential. Bareham recently saw a graduate candidate in search of a junior secretarial position. Instead, she steered her into a job which involved research, and which also had the potential to return her to the job market with far stronger prospects. </p> <p>The campaign to improve your career should begin with your current job, says Bareham. \"It is important to be recognised for what you are doing in the company you are in.\" There is little to be gained from everyone realising how much they will miss you after you have handed in your notice. </p> <p>Jumping back to the other side of the desk, how should secretaries assess a consultant? Bareham is disarmingly candid: the point of the consultant is to get the candidate a better job. \"My reputation is on the line over this, so obviously there are some people out there who think I am a great recruitment consultant and others who think I'm useless.\" But life as a recruiter is not always quite as brutal as this. \"I do get candidates ringing me up and saying someone else has found me a job, but I wish it had been you, you've done so much for me.\" This, says Bareham, is about the highest accolade she could wish for - and it does happen. </p> <p>From her own days of job-hunting, she recalls visiting consultants who would go through the interview process without even discussing the job she had enquired about. This naturally creates a bad impression, and rightly so. A good recruitment consultant should take the trouble to talk to the candidate and make her (or him) feel as if she is the only person the consultant is working for. </p> <p>In point of fact she won't be. A typical recruitment consultant will have about 100 candidates on the database at any one time. It is not surprising, then, that Bareham lists a good memory as an important asset for a consultant. But there is also an onus on the candidate to make sure she or he is remembered. It is important to keep in touch, even if it is just via the occasional email, to remind a consultant that you are still out there, and still hungry.</p>",

With traffic congestion, pollution and global warming on the increase, not to mention recent gales that have seen many ripped up and blown down, tree planting to keep the capital's natural cycle going is an essential task. </p> <p>Trees for London is an independent charity inspired by the simple philosophy that trees are of enormous importance to everyone who lives and works in the capital. \"The organisation was started by a group of friends who were getting increasingly fed up with the high level of pollution in London,\" explains Emma Hill, who has been the project administrator for Trees for London for two and half years. \"They were big party people and hit on the idea of charging people to come to their parties and using the profits to fund tree planting. They managed to provide a few schools and community projects with some new trees, and it carried on like that for a couple of years until they realised that the scheme had great potential but it couldn't go any further without full-time paid staff.\" Graham Simmonds, who has since become the charity's chief executive, was initially appointed to find sponsorship and worked alone for six months until there was sufficient funding in place to employ Hill. </p> <p>Hill had been working as an arts administrator for the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts and Commerce (RSA). Her first job after leaving school was in an attorney's office in South Africa and she travelled extensively before returning to England to complete an art founda tion course. She then moved to London where, after a stint of temping, she joined the RSA. </p> <p>\"I enjoyed working there, but my career just didn't seem to be going in the right direction,\" says Hill. \"When I joined Trees for London, the post was only three days a week so I had to survive on a fraction of my former salary, but I knew it was too good an opportunity to miss.\" There are now five members of staff, based in Prince Consort Lodge in Kennington Park, but for a while it was just Simmonds and Hill. \"We shared a desk in a Soho PR company's office and had just one phone and one computer between us,\" she says. </p> <p>One of their first projects was to re-landscape a stretch of community woodland at Lismore Circus in Gospel Oak, north London. \"It had deteriorated into a scrub area,\" Hill explains. \"Michael Palin lives nearby and he kindly launched the project for us, and we planted an oak which is actually a descendent of the original Gospel Oak.\" </p> <p>Projects are funded in a variety of ways. Sometimes a school or a community centre will make a request and Trees for London will find a way to raise the funds for the scheme. Quite often, organisations already have established links with a sponsor and have the finance in place, but need Trees for London to help them carry out their plans. \"For instance, there is a school in Poplar that has a very good relationship with a large investment bank in the City. The bank approached us and asked us to provide the school with some more trees so I went to see the head teacher to discuss what sort of trees would be suitable. You have to take into account what trees are already there and where they'll be at least risk. In this instance, the head wanted trees to provide colour and softness.\" </p> <p>Hill is always accompanied on these initial visits by an arboriculturalist (\"I don't have the knowledge to make the assessments although I am studying for the Royal Horticultural Society certificate in horticulture\"), who writes a report following the site visit. Hill then draws up a plan of action. \"For example, if we're planting at a school I'll set up a workshop for the children so that they're really fired up about the trees. I'll get quotes from tree suppliers and if there's any landscaping to do, I'll get quotes from contractors, too. </p> <p>\"I'm constantly sending out letters to all the people concerned to make sure that everyone's up to date with what is happening. It's also very important to make sure that the sponsors are free to come on the planting day.\" </p> <p>The recent heavy gusts and gales have not significantly increased Trees for London's work. \"Sadly, we don't have the resources to replace trees immediately,\" Hill explains. \"Each council has at least one tree officer with whom we work very closely, and if they have the money the tree might get replaced. But usually by this time of year their planting budget has been already been allocated so the tree will just be chopped up and replaced next year. Of course, it's a huge shame when this happens. Even if the tree is replaced, it will probably be at least another 60 or 70 years before it will look anything like its predecessor.\"</p>",

In London, for example, flooding closed Hyde Park to cars but not to bikes. \"I had the park to myself this morning,\" said one happy cyclist, a woman more accustomed to risking her life daily on her five-mile commute. </p> <p>Similarly, September's fuel crisis revived interest in cycling. \"We had lots of calls,\" says Peter Lewis, director of the London Cycle Campaign (LCC). \"We had three days of cleaner air and less traffic on the road. It showed how things could be.\" </p> <p>Under normal conditions, it is estimated that 170,000 brave souls cycle to work in the capital - about the same number go through the gates of a single central London Underground station in the rush hour. These cyclists are not the types who ride on pavements after dark, they are out in the middle of the road in all weathers.

      "bodyText": "This autumn's depressing travel conditions, both natural and man-made, have at least benefited one group - cyclists. In London, for example, flooding closed Hyde Park to cars but not to bikes. \"I had the park to myself this morning,\" said one happy cyclist, a woman more accustomed to risking her life daily on her five-mile commute. Similarly, September's fuel crisis revived interest in cycling. \"We had lots of calls,\" says Peter Lewis, director of the London Cycle Campaign (LCC). \"We had three days of cleaner air and less traffic on the road. It showed how things could be.\" Under normal conditions, it is estimated that 170,000 brave souls cycle to work in the capital - about the same number go through the gates of a single central London Underground station in the rush hour. These cyclists are not the types who ride on pavements after dark, they are out in the middle of the road in all weathers. And their major complaint is that they are all but invisible, not just to the travelling public, but to individual drivers. There is also some irony in the fact that although cycling is, on paper, the cheapest form of travel, it is easier for the privileged, because the problems city cyclists face do not end when they come off the road.

Robin Cook, another dome-sceptic, allegedly suggested: \"We could always blame the Tories if we stop it now.\"</p> <p>Ministers who backed the project included John Prescott, persuaded at the last minute by Mr Blair, Harriet Harman, Jack Straw, Mo Mowlam and Lord Richard, later sacked as leader of the lords.</p> <p>\"I start from the premise that someone has done this to damage Tony. It's designed to throw a spanner in the works,\" said one cabinet member last night. He believes the leak to be genuine. \"It sounds fairly accurate,\" admitted another cabinet member, also quoted verbatim.</p> <p>Freed from the need for ministerial caution, David Clark, one of the then-cabinet ministers correctly identified as opposing the dome, said: \"It's a very serious issue that confi dential cabinet discussions have been leaked to the press because it's crucial that everyone feels free to speak their minds at cabinet.\"</p> <p>The new row comes days after the National Audit Office condemned persistent and over-optimistic mismanagement of the dome, while opposition parties clamoured for the resignation of Lord Falconer, the minister responsible for the dome.</p> <p>While No 10 was dismissive of the new report, cabinet ministers past and present gave weight to the story in the Mail on Sunday. Several of those quoted by the newspaper agreed that the words attributed to them - 17 of the 21 cabinet members are quoted in direct speech - were broadly accurate.</p> <p>That led some to the conclusion that someone had passed over not the formal cabinet minutes which are famously bland and impersonal but the more extensive notes taken at all cabinet meetings by officials of under-secretary rank or higher.</p> <p>Such minutes are not normally seen by ministers themselves, but are filed, electronically and on paper, by the cabinet secretariat as \"confidential annexes\" in the cabinet office registry adjoining No 10. The prime minister's private office also gets a copy, as does the Queen.</p> <p>The timing is highly convenient for William Hague, whom Mr Blair blamed for his role in the early planning of the dome in 1996-97 when the Tory leader was Welsh secretary and sat on a cabinet committee called Gen(eral)36 chaired by Michael Heseltine.</p> <p>The prime minister's use of that committee - and the key decisions it took - to taunt Mr Hague at Commons question time last Wednesday may have triggered the leak. Some MPs listening felt the exchange implied that Mr Blair had been shown the cabinet committee minutes of the previous government.</p> <p>\"He's not supposed to see them and a civil servant may have counter-leaked. Access to a previous government's papers is one of the elements of power which officials have over cabinet ministers,\" said one senior Labour MP.</p> <p>It left some to wonder whether a disaffected official or a computer hacker had passed on the document to the Mail group, traditionally the prime recipient of anti-Labour leaks and sponsor of damaging books.</p> <p>Given that Whitehall mandarins do not have shorthand and cabinet meetings are rarely tape-recorded, it also made MPs ask if a minister is keeping a diary.</p> <p>Last summer a series of leaks to the Murdoch press of sensitive memos to and from Mr Blair were eventually blamed on raids on the dustbins outside the home of his pollster, Philip Gould.</p> <p>Some MPs offered a simpler explanation. They pointed to previous reports in the Mail on Sunday, based on interviews not documents, including an alleged account of Mr Brown's tax strategy.</p> <p>Entitled \"Cabinet papers expose Brown tax ploy\", it was presented as an official version of the chancellor's policy brief to the cabinet a few weeks after yesterday's similarly \"verbatim\" account of the dome cabinet on June 19 1997.</p> <p>The tax story was discredited and yesterday's report contained what ministers said were two obvious discrepancies. Both Lord Irvine, the Lord Chancellor (\"we need to know about the content\") and the home secretary, Jack Straw (\"every large project has risks\") were quoted as speaking after Mr Blair left. Yet both attended the same church service.</p> <p>Last night Peter Hennessy of Queen Mary and Westfield College, an authority on Whitehall, pronounced yesterday's account almost certainly genuine. He confirmed it is much more detailed than any minister would receive.</p> <p>\"That looks to me like the near verbatim notes taken by the cabinet secretariat. Now that is a Grade I listed leak. It's really terrific isn't it? It's blow by blow. Heaven knows where they've got it from or how,\" said Dr Hennessy. But he ruled out a civil service leak.</p> <p>Downing Street was quick to dismiss the account as fiction. \"Simon Walters [the report's author] has just written his first novel, now he's written his first play,\" quipped one senior official.</p> <p>Asked about a leaks inquiry - a notoriously ineffectual response - another despairingly said: \"We will ask the usual questions.\"</p> <p>Mr Brown was dismissive. \"I am not sure reading it if this is the meeting I was actually at,\" he told BBC1's Breakfast with Frost. \"I did not know about this minute, I have never seen this minute. I have never seen this report, it has never been circulated to me.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Senior ministers were last night facing up to the possibility of a high-level mole among officials or advisers at the heart of government after a newspaper published what it claimed to be minutes of the cabinet's crucial 1997 discus sion before deciding to build the Millennium Dome in Greenwich. Mr Blair, who left the cabinet early to attend a service at St Margaret's Church, Westminster, was quoted as saying, \"If it's a success it could even make money.\" Gordon Brown worried about the cost of turning round what Chris Smith called \"a shambles inherited from the Tories.\" David Blunkett said he was deeply against it, while Clare Short predicted it would be \"a political disaster\". Robin Cook, another dome-sceptic, allegedly suggested: \"We could always blame the Tories if we stop it now.\" Ministers who backed the project included John Prescott, persuaded at the last minute by Mr Blair, Harriet Harman, Jack Straw, Mo Mowlam and Lord Richard, later sacked as leader of the lords. \"I start from the premise that someone has done this to damage Tony. It's designed to throw a spanner in the works,\" said one cabinet member last night. He believes the leak to be genuine. \"It sounds fairly accurate,\" admitted another cabinet member, also quoted verbatim. Freed from the need for ministerial caution, David Clark, one of the then-cabinet ministers correctly identified as opposing the dome, said: \"It's a very serious issue that confi dential cabinet discussions have been leaked to the press because it's crucial that everyone feels free to speak their minds at cabinet.\" The new row comes days after the National Audit Office condemned persistent and over-optimistic mismanagement of the dome, while opposition parties clamoured for the resignation of Lord Falconer, the minister responsible for the dome. While No 10 was dismissive of the new report, cabinet ministers past and present gave weight to the story in the Mail on Sunday. Several of those quoted by the newspaper agreed that the words attributed to them - 17 of the 21 cabinet members are quoted in direct speech - were broadly accurate. That led some to the conclusion that someone had passed over not the formal cabinet minutes which are famously bland and impersonal but the more extensive notes taken at all cabinet meetings by officials of under-secretary rank or higher. Such minutes are not normally seen by ministers themselves, but are filed, electronically and on paper, by the cabinet secretariat as \"confidential annexes\" in the cabinet office registry adjoining No 10. The prime minister's private office also gets a copy, as does the Queen. The timing is highly convenient for William Hague, whom Mr Blair blamed for his role in the early planning of the dome in 1996-97 when the Tory leader was Welsh secretary and sat on a cabinet committee called Gen(eral)36 chaired by Michael Heseltine. The prime minister's use of that committee - and the key decisions it took - to taunt Mr Hague at Commons question time last Wednesday may have triggered the leak. Some MPs listening felt the exchange implied that Mr Blair had been shown the cabinet committee minutes of the previous government. \"He's not supposed to see them and a civil servant may have counter-leaked. Access to a previous government's papers is one of the elements of power which officials have over cabinet ministers,\" said one senior Labour MP. It left some to wonder whether a disaffected official or a computer hacker had passed on the document to the Mail group, traditionally the prime recipient of anti-Labour leaks and sponsor of damaging books. Given that Whitehall mandarins do not have shorthand and cabinet meetings are rarely tape-recorded, it also made MPs ask if a minister is keeping a diary. Last summer a series of leaks to the Murdoch press of sensitive memos to and from Mr Blair were eventually blamed on raids on the dustbins outside the home of his pollster, Philip Gould. Some MPs offered a simpler explanation. They pointed to previous reports in the Mail on Sunday, based on interviews not documents, including an alleged account of Mr Brown's tax strategy. Entitled \"Cabinet papers expose Brown tax ploy\", it was presented as an official version of the chancellor's policy brief to the cabinet a few weeks after yesterday's similarly \"verbatim\" account of the dome cabinet on June 19 1997. The tax story was discredited and yesterday's report contained what ministers said were two obvious discrepancies. Both Lord Irvine, the Lord Chancellor (\"we need to know about the content\") and the home secretary, Jack Straw (\"every large project has risks\") were quoted as speaking after Mr Blair left. Yet both attended the same church service. Last night Peter Hennessy of Queen Mary and Westfield College, an authority on Whitehall, pronounced yesterday's account almost certainly genuine. He confirmed it is much more detailed than any minister would receive. \"That looks to me like the near verbatim notes taken by the cabinet secretariat. Now that is a Grade I listed leak. It's really terrific isn't it? It's blow by blow. Heaven knows where they've got it from or how,\" said Dr Hennessy. But he ruled out a civil service leak. Downing Street was quick to dismiss the account as fiction. \"Simon Walters [the report's author] has just written his first novel, now he's written his first play,\" quipped one senior official. Asked about a leaks inquiry - a notoriously ineffectual response - another despairingly said: \"We will ask the usual questions.\" Mr Brown was dismissive. \"I am not sure reading it if this is the meeting I was actually at,\" he told BBC1's Breakfast with Frost. \"I did not know about this minute, I have never seen this minute. I have never seen this report, it has never been circulated to me.\"",

Mae Hyang-ri - home of the biggest US bombing range in Asia - is the focus of a growing \"Yankee Go Home\" movement in South Korea. Most Koreans are grateful for the US presence, which bolsters defences against the army in the North, but in recent years, there has been a sharp change in the political scene and the public mood. For most of the past 50 years of cold war, opponents of the US military were dismissed as communist sympathisers.

Each week, they drop tons of practice bombs and thousands of rounds of armour-piercing shells, which end up polluting the seabed and the tidal flats. The local people have silently endured this relationship for almost 50 years, but in recent months they have started to speak up about their misery and the fatal accidents which they claim they have been forced to cover up. Lee Chun-bun says her 16-year-old son was killed by a 12kg training shell that dropped without warning out of a clear blue sky in the late 1950s. \"When I lifted him in my arms, his face looked the same as ever, but the whole of the back of his head was missing,\" she recalls. \"We were too frightened to complain; the Americans had guns and if you spoke out against them, you were labelled a communist. \"We wrapped the body in a blanket, then my husband buried it secretly in the hills.

Fairness and justice (in so far as they're coterminous) must prevail. Any debacle can always be gift-wrapped in the star-spangled banner. Take a week or three and it will all be over, pavilioned in familiar self-congratulation.</p> <p>Well, perhaps. But nobody has an easy way - indeed, any sure way - of getting from here to there. George W's duly summoned federal judge, Donald M Middlebrooks, could grant an injunction in Miami today and stop the rash of hand recounts spreading across the state: the unquantified number of overseas ballot envelopes due to be opened on Friday could, as expected, put a few thousand more votes in the Republican column: Al Gore could graciously concede and leave for a new career in touch football.</p> <p>If you were betting, I suppose that might be the rosiest scenario for a resolution. Certainly the few hundred grey souls of Palm Beach County who think they might have punched the Buchanan rather than the Gore hole on election night are a pretty frail hook to hang your hat on. The ballot form, when examined, is no design triumph - but (a point the Democrats shrink from) electoral law gives you three ballot forms and three attempts to get it right; and you can always ask for help. The fact that some voters were too shy or confused to make certain may be deeply regrettable, but it doesn't justify White House limbo, especially when there's no means of proving what any individual actually did - as opposed to what they say or think they did. Tough cheddar.</p> <p>The Buchanan glitch, however, is no longer the real point. Its role in history is merely as the broken lock on Pandora's box. Take some irate voters - the Buchanan confused - and move on to the 19,120 county ballots on the night deemed invalid for one reason or another. Those are the difference between a Democratic and a Republican victory in Florida and thus in America. Yesterday's small hand count - showing marked Gore gains - is good enough evidence for that. Extrapolate them in Palm Beach alone and Al's the big winner. And since we all know that now, since those figures swirl from every TV screen, Judge Middlebrooks can't make us forget it.</p> <p>If Mr Bush gets his injunction, he'll be seen as the man who used the law to seize the Oval Office - justice without fairness. If he loses in court (and the judge is a Clinton appointment) then he'll have to get into the hand recount business himself - elsewhere in Florida Republican territory and in Iowa, Wisconsin and Oregon. Weeks, possibly months, not days. Perhaps Camelot might like to bid for the franchise.</p> <p>It is not, you will see, much of a process: and, worse, it leaves out the human element. I was sitting quietly in a Florida hotel lobby watching cable news when Bush announced his legal crusade and the reaction of the Americans around me was, to put it gently, pretty damned irate. They'd been told for four days that Gore had been wrong to encourage lawsuits - now here was the monster hypocrite doing it himself. What a lousy piece of work!</p> <p>And there lies the real, the burgeoning problem. Not that a solution, in extremity, can't be fudged out somehow: but that one half or other of this bemused, divided nation will never bring itself to accept it. This quagmire isn't about Palm Beach County any longer. If that county, with its 19,000 invalid forms, ballots again, then why not Dade and Broward and Jacksonville, all of them piling up invalids a mile high? Why not rerun the whole shooting match in every state that was too close to call? A constitutional doomsday solution to give bureaucrats and politicians alike the shakes.</p> <p>There is, alas, no intrinsic fairness here. There is only the fairness of what politically appointed election officials or politically appointed judges decide. There is no way of stopping the argument.</p> <p>For the moment, we see George W fingering his boil and looking perplexed, with Dick Cheney leering over his shoulder like a ventriloquist operating a dummy. We see Jim Baker - silkiest of fixers - delivering absurd lectures on the wonder of 40-year-old voting machines the manufacturers don't make any more. We see clearly, for the first time, what a Bush White House would be like. Texan outsiders marching on Washington as promised? No, the same gang of Old Pappy Bush's Washington outsiders wearing stetsons on camera.</p> <p>This is not a fresh and healing administration in waiting. It's the lot America got rid of in 1992 reclaiming its turf. The election leaves it with no agenda for governing such division, even if it claims a victory. And the wretched thing is that Al Gore is no better placed.</p> <p>He may, prudently, be staying quiet, toiling behind the scenes to flood Florida with lawyers and, perhaps, beginning to dent the shell of Bush confidence. But what if Middlebrooks lets the hand counts go on? What if the winner of the popular vote can eventually boast that he just about won the electoral college vote as well? How then would a President Gore work with a Senate and house which both have Republican majorities who believe \"we was robbed\"?</p> <p>Americans, having rather little history, are prone to make too much of the history they have. The airwaves continue thick with learned professors prognosticating on what Grover Cleveland or Benjamin Harrison, let alone Harry S Truman, might have done. But history doesn't include a race like this, locked in increasingly visceral dispute, one which panders to all the worst instincts of the new breed of attack dogs on Capitol Hill. There is no kindly light at the end of this tunnel. A winning Gore would start losing from the moment he took the oath of office.</p> <p>Does gridlock matter? Wall Street, last Wednesday morning, thought not. Its plump gurus emerged to praise a supposed result in which nobody would be able to do anything controversial and accustomed profits would flow. But Wall Street has got the jitters since, fretting over uncertainty - and the total certainty of total uncertainty looms. Both Bush and Gore have lost badly in the past few days. Neither Bush nor Gore - trading insults - will be able to do much more than preside for the next four years.

      "bodyText": "Too many endgames and no sign of an end. The official message, of course, is keep calm, trust the process, show the resilience of American democracy. Fairness and justice (in so far as they're coterminous) must prevail. Any debacle can always be gift-wrapped in the star-spangled banner. Take a week or three and it will all be over, pavilioned in familiar self-congratulation. Well, perhaps. But nobody has an easy way - indeed, any sure way - of getting from here to there. George W's duly summoned federal judge, Donald M Middlebrooks, could grant an injunction in Miami today and stop the rash of hand recounts spreading across the state: the unquantified number of overseas ballot envelopes due to be opened on Friday could, as expected, put a few thousand more votes in the Republican column: Al Gore could graciously concede and leave for a new career in touch football. If you were betting, I suppose that might be the rosiest scenario for a resolution. Certainly the few hundred grey souls of Palm Beach County who think they might have punched the Buchanan rather than the Gore hole on election night are a pretty frail hook to hang your hat on. The ballot form, when examined, is no design triumph - but (a point the Democrats shrink from) electoral law gives you three ballot forms and three attempts to get it right; and you can always ask for help. The fact that some voters were too shy or confused to make certain may be deeply regrettable, but it doesn't justify White House limbo, especially when there's no means of proving what any individual actually did - as opposed to what they say or think they did. Tough cheddar. The Buchanan glitch, however, is no longer the real point. Its role in history is merely as the broken lock on Pandora's box. Take some irate voters - the Buchanan confused - and move on to the 19,120 county ballots on the night deemed invalid for one reason or another. Those are the difference between a Democratic and a Republican victory in Florida and thus in America. Yesterday's small hand count - showing marked Gore gains - is good enough evidence for that. Extrapolate them in Palm Beach alone and Al's the big winner. And since we all know that now, since those figures swirl from every TV screen, Judge Middlebrooks can't make us forget it. If Mr Bush gets his injunction, he'll be seen as the man who used the law to seize the Oval Office - justice without fairness. If he loses in court (and the judge is a Clinton appointment) then he'll have to get into the hand recount business himself - elsewhere in Florida Republican territory and in Iowa, Wisconsin and Oregon. Weeks, possibly months, not days. Perhaps Camelot might like to bid for the franchise. It is not, you will see, much of a process: and, worse, it leaves out the human element. I was sitting quietly in a Florida hotel lobby watching cable news when Bush announced his legal crusade and the reaction of the Americans around me was, to put it gently, pretty damned irate. They'd been told for four days that Gore had been wrong to encourage lawsuits - now here was the monster hypocrite doing it himself. What a lousy piece of work! And there lies the real, the burgeoning problem. Not that a solution, in extremity, can't be fudged out somehow: but that one half or other of this bemused, divided nation will never bring itself to accept it. This quagmire isn't about Palm Beach County any longer. If that county, with its 19,000 invalid forms, ballots again, then why not Dade and Broward and Jacksonville, all of them piling up invalids a mile high? Why not rerun the whole shooting match in every state that was too close to call? A constitutional doomsday solution to give bureaucrats and politicians alike the shakes. There is, alas, no intrinsic fairness here. There is only the fairness of what politically appointed election officials or politically appointed judges decide. There is no way of stopping the argument. For the moment, we see George W fingering his boil and looking perplexed, with Dick Cheney leering over his shoulder like a ventriloquist operating a dummy. We see Jim Baker - silkiest of fixers - delivering absurd lectures on the wonder of 40-year-old voting machines the manufacturers don't make any more. We see clearly, for the first time, what a Bush White House would be like. Texan outsiders marching on Washington as promised? No, the same gang of Old Pappy Bush's Washington outsiders wearing stetsons on camera. This is not a fresh and healing administration in waiting. It's the lot America got rid of in 1992 reclaiming its turf. The election leaves it with no agenda for governing such division, even if it claims a victory. And the wretched thing is that Al Gore is no better placed. He may, prudently, be staying quiet, toiling behind the scenes to flood Florida with lawyers and, perhaps, beginning to dent the shell of Bush confidence. But what if Middlebrooks lets the hand counts go on? What if the winner of the popular vote can eventually boast that he just about won the electoral college vote as well? How then would a President Gore work with a Senate and house which both have Republican majorities who believe \"we was robbed\"? Americans, having rather little history, are prone to make too much of the history they have. The airwaves continue thick with learned professors prognosticating on what Grover Cleveland or Benjamin Harrison, let alone Harry S Truman, might have done. But history doesn't include a race like this, locked in increasingly visceral dispute, one which panders to all the worst instincts of the new breed of attack dogs on Capitol Hill. There is no kindly light at the end of this tunnel. A winning Gore would start losing from the moment he took the oath of office. Does gridlock matter? Wall Street, last Wednesday morning, thought not. Its plump gurus emerged to praise a supposed result in which nobody would be able to do anything controversial and accustomed profits would flow. But Wall Street has got the jitters since, fretting over uncertainty - and the total certainty of total uncertainty looms. Both Bush and Gore have lost badly in the past few days. Neither Bush nor Gore - trading insults - will be able to do much more than preside for the next four years. Neither Bush nor Gore, whoever concedes in the court of public opinion, has any obvious way of claiming the only legitimacy that matters, emotional legitimacy. Welcome to the land of happy endings, to American faith in the American way. But power, by the minute, is becoming detached from the public support - or acquiescence - that gives it meaning. Sometimes there are no happy endings. peter.preston@theguardian.com",

It's not something that's going to happen in three months.\" </p> <p>Mr Hoerner has taken drastic action, axeing the firm's Principles for Men chain and closing 400 stores in a turnaround strategy called Brandmax. There have been encouraging signs since August, with retail sales density up 7.3%. and like-for-like sales up 4.8%.</p> <p><strong>Fashion, style and the prickly Rose</strong></p> <p>With his slick haircut, immaculate suits and ready one-liners, Stuart Rose cuts a confident and distinctive figure in the retailing world. </p> <p>The 50-year-old rattles out speech like a machine gun and seems constantly restless to move on.

      "bodyText": "Sunday Times EMI investors are set to receive a bonus of at least \u00a31.50 a share - \u00a31.2bn in total - if they agree to merge their company with Bertelsmann's music offshoot BMG. The two top jobs within the merged group would be taken by EMI's Eric Nicoli and Ken Berry. The government could reap billions from a further auction of the radio spectrum if it decides to sell the area used by the Ministry of Defence. Industrial group Tomkins, at the centre of a scandal over directors' perks, has suspended three executives. There is no suggestion the three abused their perks, and staff remain puzzled. Sunday Telegraph Life insurance group CGNU is understood to have pulled out of the auction for mutual insurer Equitable Life, which was forced to put itself up for sale in July. The move will leave Prudential as the last remaining bidder for Equitable, which could be worth up to \u00a34.5bn. Pubmaster, the pub company which was part of the Brent Walker empire, is to be sold to a group of pub trade and property buyers backed by German bank WestLB, for around \u00a3200m. Mail on Sunday Nasdaq chief executive Frank Zarb, below, is planning to visit Britain to open merger talks with his counterparts at the London Stock Exchange. The move follows last week's failure of a \u00a3940m hostile bid for the LSE by Sweden's OM Group. Sunday Express One of Canada's biggest mutual funds, Trimark, has dumped almost half its holding in Huntingdon Life Sciences, the company being targeted by animal rights protesters. Observer Allied Domecq, the drinks company, is on the verge of sealing a deal to buy Stolichnaya, the vodka manufacturer and world's biggest-selling spirits brand. The deal gives Allied US distribution rights and marks an outmanoeuvring of Diageo, which lost the Stolichnaya rights after concerns in Russia that it was promoting its Smirnoff brand more heavily in the US. Goldman Sachs, the world's biggest investment bank, is crunching the numbers this weekend for a possible \u00a315bn bid from Barclays for Abbey National. Barclays is now the City's favourite to intervene for the former building society ahead of Lloyds TSB after Abbey put itself in play with a spurned bid for Bank of Scotland 10 days ago. Under pressure from City institutions, advisers to Abbey and BoS are trying to resurrect their \u00a324bn merger. Sunday Business BT is set to reopen partial merger talks with America's AT&amp;T after extensive restructuring moves by both companies in the past three weeks. Brewer Scottish &amp; Newcastle is expected finally to complete the long awaited sale of its Center Parcs division this week. It is expected to be sold to a joint venture between Deutsche Bank and French holiday company Pierre et Vacances for about \u00a3650m. German holiday company Condor &amp; Neckermann is believed to be ready to pay \u00a3600m-\u00a3700m for Thomas Cook. IoS Marks &amp; Spencer is considering dropping the M&amp;S name from up to 50 of its stores. It plans a revamp of the stores in depressed areas, reintroducing them as a new downmarket concept. Leisure group Rank wants a high street bookmaker and has put Ladbrokes, owned by Hilton, at the top of its target list.

      "trailText": "<p>More than a century after his death, Isambard Kingdom Brunel is still the greatest engineer Britain has ever produced. <strong>Jonathan Glancey</strong> hails a visionary who refused to compromise</p>",
      "byline": "Jonathan Glancey",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Isambard Kingdom Brunel (1806-59) was one of the greatest of all engineers. His protean works shaped the way we now view Victorian Britain - a waistcoated thing of cocksure, masculine endeavour - and the fast-disappearing industrial landscape that once made Britain the workshop of the world. To have designed and built the Royal Albert bridge in Saltash and the Clifton Suspension near Bristol alone would have made Brunel's name near-immortal. Add to these, in a life of just 53 years, the revolutionary Great Western and Great Eastern steamships, Paddington station, a prefab hospital for Florence Nightingale in the Crimea, the fastest railway locomotives of the day and an entire mainline railway - the Great Western from Paddington to Bristol - and you have a 19th-century Hercules. </p> <p>Today, in the suitably hushed and cathedral-like setting of London's Design Museum, Brunel's life and legacy are celebrated in a calm, intelligent exhibition that makes you marvel not just at how one man could have achieved so much, but at how he led several revolutions in design, engineering and architecture. Certainly Brunel proves to be hard for modern commentators to cope with: in the past fortnight he has been described as \"an architect\" and even as \"product designer\" in reviews of the exhibition. </p> <p>He was neither of these things. He was an engineer from the straps of his battered boots to the lofty rim of his stove-pipe hat. You can see that he was bursting with energy and had precious little time for the etiquette of his age in Robert Howlett's iconic photograph of him standing beside the massive chains of the \"checking drum\" from the Great Eastern steamship in 1857. Brunel's stance suggests a man who finds being photographed a damned bore. His restless hands are thrust into his high trouser pockets, one leg is bent as if he is ready to stride out of the camera's frame. His gaze is far off. There is a cigar cantilevered aggressively to one side of his wide mouth. So much to do, says Howlett's unforgettable portrait, so little time. </p> <p>The Design Museum's exhibition, designed by Nicholas Grimshaw and Partners, is worthwhile because instead of trying to encompass the entire canon of Brunel's work, it focuses on seven key projects. There are commentaries by architects and engineers such as Grimshaw and Tony Hunt, who remain in thrall to their Victorian mentor. David Marks and Julia Barfield, architects of the London Eye, capture Brunel's perennial appeal nicely when they suggest that he remains a role model for designers, architects, engineers, artists and managers. \"He had energy, talent and determination, creating visionary designs and applying new engineering principles, as well as co-ordinating and motivating people from all walks of life. He transformed the British landscape and changed peoples' lives.\" </p> <p>He could also be silly. It sounds the stuff of music-hall song but Brunel once swallowed a gold sovereign while performing a trick at a children's party. The coin got stuck in one of his lungs.

      "bodyText": "Isambard Kingdom Brunel (1806-59) was one of the greatest of all engineers. His protean works shaped the way we now view Victorian Britain - a waistcoated thing of cocksure, masculine endeavour - and the fast-disappearing industrial landscape that once made Britain the workshop of the world. To have designed and built the Royal Albert bridge in Saltash and the Clifton Suspension near Bristol alone would have made Brunel's name near-immortal. Add to these, in a life of just 53 years, the revolutionary Great Western and Great Eastern steamships, Paddington station, a prefab hospital for Florence Nightingale in the Crimea, the fastest railway locomotives of the day and an entire mainline railway - the Great Western from Paddington to Bristol - and you have a 19th-century Hercules. Today, in the suitably hushed and cathedral-like setting of London's Design Museum, Brunel's life and legacy are celebrated in a calm, intelligent exhibition that makes you marvel not just at how one man could have achieved so much, but at how he led several revolutions in design, engineering and architecture. Certainly Brunel proves to be hard for modern commentators to cope with: in the past fortnight he has been described as \"an architect\" and even as \"product designer\" in reviews of the exhibition. He was neither of these things. He was an engineer from the straps of his battered boots to the lofty rim of his stove-pipe hat. You can see that he was bursting with energy and had precious little time for the etiquette of his age in Robert Howlett's iconic photograph of him standing beside the massive chains of the \"checking drum\" from the Great Eastern steamship in 1857. Brunel's stance suggests a man who finds being photographed a damned bore. His restless hands are thrust into his high trouser pockets, one leg is bent as if he is ready to stride out of the camera's frame. His gaze is far off. There is a cigar cantilevered aggressively to one side of his wide mouth. So much to do, says Howlett's unforgettable portrait, so little time. The Design Museum's exhibition, designed by Nicholas Grimshaw and Partners, is worthwhile because instead of trying to encompass the entire canon of Brunel's work, it focuses on seven key projects. There are commentaries by architects and engineers such as Grimshaw and Tony Hunt, who remain in thrall to their Victorian mentor. David Marks and Julia Barfield, architects of the London Eye, capture Brunel's perennial appeal nicely when they suggest that he remains a role model for designers, architects, engineers, artists and managers. \"He had energy, talent and determination, creating visionary designs and applying new engineering principles, as well as co-ordinating and motivating people from all walks of life. He transformed the British landscape and changed peoples' lives.\" He could also be silly. It sounds the stuff of music-hall song but Brunel once swallowed a gold sovereign while performing a trick at a children's party. The coin got stuck in one of his lungs. Doctors came and, as they charged their fees, said there was no cure for this disease - so Brunel devised a vertical turntable on to which he was strapped. As it turned, the coin was expelled. He wasn't always successful either. The Great Eastern - at 692ft long and 18,915 tons (no bigger ship was built for 40 years) - proved to be, in the words of naval architect Fred M Walker, \"designed for a market that had not been properly researched. She was just too large and built too soon for the technology of the time.\" Brunel's determination to design on a colossal scale was both in tune with the ambitions of the ever-expanding British Empire and a godsend to those in charge of his physical legacy today. Famously, when he built the Great Western Railway during the late 1830s and 1840s, he did so to a track gauge of 7ft 1 / 4 in. This \"broad-gauge\" track enabled GW trains to run quickly and smoothly at a time when rail travel was a decidedly bumpy experience, although perhaps not quite as bad as the west-coast mainline today. The tracks of the rest of Britain's rail network were just 4ft 8 1 / 2 in apart.

Not that this stopped them pursuing victory with equal intensity, campaigning up and down the country right into the crucial last few hours. </p> <p>The nail-biting finish proved to be more interesting than the contest itself, with the victor finally pulling ahead after a tense week that exposed both sides as power-hungry masters of PR. In an emotional concession speeech, the loser declared, \"At the end of the day, it's about the big picture, not just this country,\" and flounced off to Gucci. </p> <p>In a week when Britain seemed to be going to hell on a fast train (had any been running) and the rest of the world was focused on Bush and Gore, it's reassuring to know that we've got our priorities right. Westlife's ultimately successful struggle with the Spice Women for number one album figured heavily in the press all last week, with the tabloids even running daily counts ahead of yesterday's final chart positions. </p> <p>The combatants did their damnedest to convince us the rivalry was personal. Westlife's Kian warned, \"We're going to do as much as we can to kick their asses\", while Mel C displayed a Liam Gallagheresque grasp of invective: \"Westlife are a useless bunch of talentless tossers who don't deserve to be in the charts. They'll probably beat us to number one, which sums up how shit music is at the moment.\" Obviously, Ms C is in no way responsible for the manufactured teen-pop bands who have strangled the UK charts for the past three years. </p> <p>Both camps held launch parties at London clubs within yards of each other on the same night. If nudity counts, the Spice bash was the runaway winner, with the previously demure Baby flashing hemispheres of bosom, while Posh was naked save for wisps of green chiffon. But Westlife put on more of a show, inviting not just a Spice tribute band but - oh, unkindest cut - Mel C's ex-boyfriend, J from Five. There wasn't much atmosphere at either bash, though, until Mels B and C directed an unprovoked string of F-words at a group of journalists. </p> <p>We all enjoyed this scrap between two lots of dancers who, in a more righteous age, would have enjoyed careers as understudies to the First Elf in a provincial production of Cinderella. But it is a sad reminder that we live in a time when ambition is deemed more important than talent, and \"music\" is something that helps pop stars pass the time on the way to Camp Famous. As Kian put it, \"If we don't go in at number one, I don't know where we go from here.\" May I suggest the chorus line of Riverdance? </p> <p>So it has been an ignominious battle, pitting a band who took time out from solo careers for a temporary show of unity against a band who have had seven chart-topping singles, none of which most people could name. And the public has become increasingly sophisticated about the dark art of public relations: we've seen too many false \"relationships\" and \"feuds\" in the last few years to believe that this is anything more than massive hype to line the pockets of all concerned. </p> <p>It gives the last big chart rivalry, the 1995 Blur/Oasis squabble (let's forget Victoria Beckham's catfight with Sophie Ellis-Bextor last summer), the feeling of a lost golden age. It may have been equally contrived, with Damon Albarn changing Blur's release date to challenge Oasis, but there was a sense of fun, like yobbos squaring off in the playground. While neither song (Roll With It and Country House) was outstanding, each could only have come from Gallagher or Albarn's pen. </p> <p>By comparison, the Westlife/Spice contest, and the albums themselves, feel utterly impersonal. The whole affair has little to do with music and everything to do with making sure RCA and Virgin shareholders have a happy Christmas, and the protagonists can keep shopping at Prada. </p> <p>However unconvincing the hissing and spitting, retailers were delighted with so-called Super Monday, which also saw the release of Fatboy Slim's Halfway Between the Gutter &amp; The Stars - unexpectedly consigned to a dismal eighth place with only 21,000 sales by last Friday. \"We've definitely had more people in because of these albums, and this really gets the ball rolling for Christmas,\" says Gennaro Castaldo of HMV. He's echoed by Paul Williams of trade magazine Music Week: \"It's excellent news for retail. This is the most high-profile battle in years, and the media interest has generated plenty of sales. Record companies study each other's release schedules and usually avoid releasing in the same week as big records, but RCA [Westlife's label] were determined to be up against the Spice Girls. They wanted the battle to be played out.\" </p> <p>Westlife had more to lose if they missed out on number one. Unlike the Spices, they have yet to break America, so a British chart-topper provides them with a foundation for another try. One of this year's hot industry topics has been the British and Irish inability to crack the US: in 1999, acts from these islands accounted for a total of 0.2% of the American chart, compared with 32% in 1986. George Michael, whose Wham! were part of that 32%, has blamed the downturn on a glut of manufactured, stage-school bands. But Westlife may be the biggest hope for success by a British-signed act in the land of Limp Bizkit. It's not that we haven't got a plethora of groovy young rock acts to throw at them, such as Coldplay and Doves, it's just that none of them is big enough to be considered sexy in a country where, if your last album didn't sell 10m copies, you're small potatoes. </p> <p>The last huge British or Irish hit there was, of course, by the Spices, who are currently in transition from cultural icondom to...who knows what? If there are any lessons to be learned from the WestSpice stand-off, it's that Girl Power now exists only in 20th-century phrasebooks, and that winning is more important than anything else. </p> <p>Last week Emma Bunton nicely summed up this sad ethos: \"Westlife really deserve to be number one with the amount of promotion they've been doing.\" Not because they've made a good record, but because they've promoted it well.

A police spokesman refused to comment on how long the operation would last. \"It all depends on GAM,\" he said. \"They are causing the trouble and we are just trying to maintain order.\"</p> <p>The Indonesian president, Abdurrahman Wahid, blamed the violence on rogue troops.</p> <p>Foreign witnesses and rights groups say it is a clearly orchestrated operation.</p> <p>Sidney Jones, the Asia director of Human Rights Watch, fears a massive crackdown. \"The Indonesian armed forces seem to be reverting to the worst days of the Suharto era,\" she said, referring to the former dictator. \"In the misguided notion that the push for a referendum is led by GAM, the army and police are turning their guns on civilians.\"</p> <p>GAM was formed in 1976 and Jakarta began to crack down in earnest in 1990.

But with people pouring towards the city, officials had no idea how to respond, except with the deadly tactics used by the previous regime. A British researcher, Lesley McCulloch, said she witnessed \"uncontrolled police and army brutality\" several times last week. \"I saw people being shot at,\" she said. \"I saw people being forced to sing Indonesian songs and pray to the police at gunpoint... All this was because they wanted to attend the rally in Banda Aceh.\" The tension is likely to remain high because organisers said the rally would continue until all those who wanted to attend could do so. \"We are not going to give up,\" coordinator Muhammad Nazar said. \"We owe it to all the people of Aceh to stay here so they can come and register their views.\" He said GAM had nothing to do with the rally but that the rebels would support it \"because just about everyone here wants independence\". At least 50,000 people reached Banda Aceh's main mosque to mark the first anniversary of the referendum movement. The rally was peaceful but at least three incidents of police shooting at civilians were reported later in the day. Agus Suwandi, the leader of the Commission on Victims of Violence, said one person died in those attacks and that six bodies were found yesterday in the east of the province. \"Local villagers suspect the bodies are those of people who were arrested earlier in the week while trying to reach Banda Aceh,\" he said. \"If what we are hearing is correct, this is likely to be repeated many times over this week.\" Armoured cars continued to patrol Banda Aceh yesterday and were blocking all main roads into the city. A police spokesman refused to comment on how long the operation would last. \"It all depends on GAM,\" he said. \"They are causing the trouble and we are just trying to maintain order.\" The Indonesian president, Abdurrahman Wahid, blamed the violence on rogue troops. Foreign witnesses and rights groups say it is a clearly orchestrated operation. Sidney Jones, the Asia director of Human Rights Watch, fears a massive crackdown. \"The Indonesian armed forces seem to be reverting to the worst days of the Suharto era,\" she said, referring to the former dictator. \"In the misguided notion that the push for a referendum is led by GAM, the army and police are turning their guns on civilians.\" GAM was formed in 1976 and Jakarta began to crack down in earnest in 1990. About 6,000 have died since then, including more than 230 in the last five months, during which an informal truce has theoretically been in existence.",

      "body": "<p>For the many tipsy revellers making their way from one Palm Beach nightclub to another, it was a bewildering sight. A huge throng of journalists and television cameramen were lined up outside an office building, staring for hours on end at the scene within.</p> <p>On the other side of the plate glass window, there were no movie stars or national leaders, just a tableau of exhausted bureacrats slumped in their chairs holding manila rectangles of cardboard up to the fluorescent light, like connoisseurs comparing notes.</p> <p>As far as the mostly oblivious Saturday night partygoers were concerned, it could have been a regular meeting of the cardboard collectors' club, but the reality was far stranger. Somewhere in those flimsy yellow rectangles lay the coded fate of the US and perhaps the world, and this sleep-derived group of local civic leaders from this affuent seaside resort had been entrusted with the task of deciphering it.</p> <p>The more you peered into that coldly-lit room, the odder it seemed. The panel inside the media fishtank were poring over the cardboard in search of something called \"chad\", which in the past 48 hours has become to the US electoral process what the \"quark\" is to physics - a tiny and obscure particle on which absolutely everything may hinge.</p> <p>This is what is known so far about \"chad\": It can be both singular and plural, it comes in a variety of forms including \"hanging chad\", \"swing-door chad\", \"tri-chad\" and even \"pregnant chad\", and it can be more visible to the naked human eye than it is to machines.</p> <p>Chad occurs when voters are asked to express their preferences with punchcards dotted with very small perforated rectangles. On the Palm Beach ballot, there were 228 of such little perforations.</p> <p>The voter is supposed to use a pointed instrument to knock out the tiny rectangles alongside his or her choice of candidate. What \"alongside\" means precisely is a point of bitter debate, but more of that later. If the perforated rectangle is punched but manages to cling on by one or more of the cardboard slivers connecting it to the card, it becomes \"chad\" and a threat to democracy.</p> <p>It is a menace because when the voter's card is fed through an automatic vote-counting machine, the \"chad\" is often smoothed back into the hole, in effect nullifying the vote. It does not happen often, but with the margin between Governor George W Bush and Vice-President Al Gore in the decisive state of Florida a mere 327 votes out of some 9m cast across the state, it could be decisive.</p> <p>Palm Beach county had opted to use something called a \"butterfly ballot\", on which the names of candidates were arranged on both sides of a central strip of punch-holes, which, in a few thousand cases, appears to have caused confusion as to which candidate was alongside which hole. According to the automated count, more than 29,000 votes - an unusually high number - were recorded as spoilt because they had been punched too many times, or not at all.</p> <p>A manual recount was ordered in Palm Beach and three other counties which had problems of their own. In Palm Beach Here among the hotels and nightclubs, the task fell to the three-member canvassing board, consisting of Theresa LePore, the hapless elections supervisor who had designed the butterfly ballot, Charles Burton, a county judge, and Carol Roberts, a county commissioner. But for the sake of (literal) transparency, they were to be watched by the world's media and accompanied by assorted political observers.</p> <p>The count, of a sample 1% of the county's votes, started at 2pm on Saturday with a solemn invocation from Ms LePore: \"Never touch the chad\".</p> <p>At the outset the board tried to gauge how much light was showing through the little holes, bringing shouts of \"There is light through there\", and \"that's just a micron of light\".</p> <p>It was soon clear that this was not going to work. No one, least of all the Republican and Democratic observers, was going to agree on what constituted enough light. So the board reverted to a 1990 rule, which stipulated that if any of the slivers holding the perforated rectangle to the voting card had been broken, it would count as a vote.</p> <p>Three slivers was known as a \"tri-chad\", two slivers would be a \"swing-door chad\", one sliver was a \"hanging chad\". If the rectangle had been pressed so it protruded without any of its slivers being bro ken, it was a \"pregnant chad\", or sometimes a \"dimple chad\", and it did not count as a vote. As Judge Burton pointed out on more than one occasion: \"You can't be a little bit pregnant\".</p> <p>The board examined 4,695 ballots and it took them 11 hours, deep into the early hours of yesterday morning.</p> <p>\"It was amazing\", said the Green party's excited observer, Medea Benjamin, as she emerged into the warm night air. \"The fate of the most powerful country in the world hangs in the balance with those stacks of cards.\"</p> <p>After the recount, Mr Gore's vote total was up 33, and Mr Bush's by 14, a net gain of 19. If that was just 1% of the Palm Beach vote, the Democrats argued, then a total manual recount over the whole county could swing the election in Florida in the vice-president's favour.</p> <p>In an exemplary stab at open democracy, the three board members stood in front of the cameras argued out the merits of calling a full recount, but they were clearly exhausted and sometimes struggled for coherence.</p> <p>Carol Roberts, a Democrat, insisted that the board vote on the spot on whether to hold a recount. Judge Burton, a less committed Democrat, said the board should wait until Monday to ask for advice.</p> <p>It was left to Theresa LePore to decide. She is also a Democrat who has reportedly cried every day since it was discovered that her ballot design could have cost the party the presidency. She looked pale and barely conscious. She initially seconded both Ms Roberts and Judge Burton's proposals, but when she was told she could not, she sided with Ms Roberts.</p> <p>Ms Roberts, a petite middle-aged woman in steel-rimmed glasses, always seemed likely to win out. She remained grimly determined. The other two looked as if they would say anything to get some sleep.</p> <p>The vote-counters dispersed into the night to rest before another few days of chad-squinting, barring a successful Republican injunction against the manual recount today. In the empty room a discarded election-day sign stood propped against a wall. \"I Count, I Vote\" it declared.</p> <p>In the pre-dawn hours yesterday that seemed debatable, at best.</p>",

      "bodyText": "For the many tipsy revellers making their way from one Palm Beach nightclub to another, it was a bewildering sight. A huge throng of journalists and television cameramen were lined up outside an office building, staring for hours on end at the scene within. On the other side of the plate glass window, there were no movie stars or national leaders, just a tableau of exhausted bureacrats slumped in their chairs holding manila rectangles of cardboard up to the fluorescent light, like connoisseurs comparing notes. As far as the mostly oblivious Saturday night partygoers were concerned, it could have been a regular meeting of the cardboard collectors' club, but the reality was far stranger. Somewhere in those flimsy yellow rectangles lay the coded fate of the US and perhaps the world, and this sleep-derived group of local civic leaders from this affuent seaside resort had been entrusted with the task of deciphering it. The more you peered into that coldly-lit room, the odder it seemed. The panel inside the media fishtank were poring over the cardboard in search of something called \"chad\", which in the past 48 hours has become to the US electoral process what the \"quark\" is to physics - a tiny and obscure particle on which absolutely everything may hinge. This is what is known so far about \"chad\": It can be both singular and plural, it comes in a variety of forms including \"hanging chad\", \"swing-door chad\", \"tri-chad\" and even \"pregnant chad\", and it can be more visible to the naked human eye than it is to machines. Chad occurs when voters are asked to express their preferences with punchcards dotted with very small perforated rectangles. On the Palm Beach ballot, there were 228 of such little perforations. The voter is supposed to use a pointed instrument to knock out the tiny rectangles alongside his or her choice of candidate. What \"alongside\" means precisely is a point of bitter debate, but more of that later. If the perforated rectangle is punched but manages to cling on by one or more of the cardboard slivers connecting it to the card, it becomes \"chad\" and a threat to democracy. It is a menace because when the voter's card is fed through an automatic vote-counting machine, the \"chad\" is often smoothed back into the hole, in effect nullifying the vote. It does not happen often, but with the margin between Governor George W Bush and Vice-President Al Gore in the decisive state of Florida a mere 327 votes out of some 9m cast across the state, it could be decisive. Palm Beach county had opted to use something called a \"butterfly ballot\", on which the names of candidates were arranged on both sides of a central strip of punch-holes, which, in a few thousand cases, appears to have caused confusion as to which candidate was alongside which hole. According to the automated count, more than 29,000 votes - an unusually high number - were recorded as spoilt because they had been punched too many times, or not at all. A manual recount was ordered in Palm Beach and three other counties which had problems of their own. In Palm Beach Here among the hotels and nightclubs, the task fell to the three-member canvassing board, consisting of Theresa LePore, the hapless elections supervisor who had designed the butterfly ballot, Charles Burton, a county judge, and Carol Roberts, a county commissioner. But for the sake of (literal) transparency, they were to be watched by the world's media and accompanied by assorted political observers. The count, of a sample 1% of the county's votes, started at 2pm on Saturday with a solemn invocation from Ms LePore: \"Never touch the chad\". At the outset the board tried to gauge how much light was showing through the little holes, bringing shouts of \"There is light through there\", and \"that's just a micron of light\". It was soon clear that this was not going to work. No one, least of all the Republican and Democratic observers, was going to agree on what constituted enough light. So the board reverted to a 1990 rule, which stipulated that if any of the slivers holding the perforated rectangle to the voting card had been broken, it would count as a vote. Three slivers was known as a \"tri-chad\", two slivers would be a \"swing-door chad\", one sliver was a \"hanging chad\". If the rectangle had been pressed so it protruded without any of its slivers being bro ken, it was a \"pregnant chad\", or sometimes a \"dimple chad\", and it did not count as a vote. As Judge Burton pointed out on more than one occasion: \"You can't be a little bit pregnant\". The board examined 4,695 ballots and it took them 11 hours, deep into the early hours of yesterday morning. \"It was amazing\", said the Green party's excited observer, Medea Benjamin, as she emerged into the warm night air. \"The fate of the most powerful country in the world hangs in the balance with those stacks of cards.\" After the recount, Mr Gore's vote total was up 33, and Mr Bush's by 14, a net gain of 19. If that was just 1% of the Palm Beach vote, the Democrats argued, then a total manual recount over the whole county could swing the election in Florida in the vice-president's favour. In an exemplary stab at open democracy, the three board members stood in front of the cameras argued out the merits of calling a full recount, but they were clearly exhausted and sometimes struggled for coherence. Carol Roberts, a Democrat, insisted that the board vote on the spot on whether to hold a recount. Judge Burton, a less committed Democrat, said the board should wait until Monday to ask for advice. It was left to Theresa LePore to decide. She is also a Democrat who has reportedly cried every day since it was discovered that her ballot design could have cost the party the presidency. She looked pale and barely conscious. She initially seconded both Ms Roberts and Judge Burton's proposals, but when she was told she could not, she sided with Ms Roberts. Ms Roberts, a petite middle-aged woman in steel-rimmed glasses, always seemed likely to win out. She remained grimly determined. The other two looked as if they would say anything to get some sleep. The vote-counters dispersed into the night to rest before another few days of chad-squinting, barring a successful Republican injunction against the manual recount today. In the empty room a discarded election-day sign stood propped against a wall. \"I Count, I Vote\" it declared. In the pre-dawn hours yesterday that seemed debatable, at best.",

The National Alliance said councils that under its control would set up a \"panel of experts\" to vet reading lists. The party also controls the region of Lazio, which includes Rome.

Alleged bias includes twisting Mussolini's war record, ignoring partisan atrocities against fascists and distortions about recent events. A history book by Augusto Camera and Renato Fabietti stands accused of assassinating the character of Silvio Berlusconi, the opposition leader who included the National Alliance in his 1994 government. Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia party distanced itself, saying that bias existed but that a panel was inappropriate. \"The problem is finding the right cure,\" a spokesman said.

The black lump known as Graham Island is threatening to reappear 169 years after a British naval captain planted a union flag and proclaimed it part of the empire. To bolster their case, Sicilians, who call it Ferdinandea, summoned the descendant of the Bourbon King of Naples. In a ceremony filmed by a flotilla of camera crews, Prince Carlo di Bourbon lowered a plaque into the waves and told cheering locals: \"It will always be Sicilian.\" The island, 30 miles off the town of Sciacca, was first recorded in 10BC. Concentric wave patterns suggest that the volcano, now six metres below the surface, is likely to rise in the near future, said the Italian National Institute of Geophysics. When it last surfaced on July 18 1831, Capt Humphrey Le Fleming Senhouse led a British naval party to the summit and named it after the first lord of the admiralty, Sir James Robert George Graham. The King of Naples, Ferdinand II, was furious at losing a potentially strategic base and sent a warship to replace the union flag. A French party also landed and named it Giulia, setting the scene for a three-way war which was only averted when the island sank again on January 12 1832. Lobbied by fishermen and sailors, Ignazio Cucchiara, the mayor of Sciacca, invited Prince Carlo to attend the ceremony with his wife, Countess Camilla Cruciani. To accommodate television crews the plaque was lowered well before reaching the shoal, which is a danger to shipping. Choppy waters forced divers to postpone until this week an attempt to plant Sicily's flag, which features a Medusa's head surrounded by three naked legs - a sign that is traditionally interpreted as \"keep away\".16",

It also has a national government which has a say across both entities.</p> <p>In the central parliament, social democrats, conservatives and liberal parties from both entities look set to form a majority coalition without the nationalists.</p> <p>In the Federation, the Social Democratic party, led by a 46-year-old computer science professor, Zlatko Lagumdzija, looks set to win a majority. In the Serb-controlled half, the nationalist Serbian Democratic party (SDS) expects to win but may not have enough seats to rule alone. That should pave the way for Mladen Ivanic's Party of Democratic Progress (PDP) and the prime minister Milorad Dodik's Independent Social Democrats (SNSD) to share power with them.</p> <p>Full results of the elections should become clear once the votes of up to 1m refugees and displaced persons are counted.</p> <p>The Dayton peace accords which brought the war to an end in December 1995 are full of contradictions, allowing considerable power to be held by the two entities, but also the possibility of bolstering the institutions of the central state.</p> <p>Overseeing the rebuilding of Bosnia is the international high representative, the Austrian diplomat Wolfgang Petritsch, who risks appeasing nationalists and alienating progressive forces by not doing enough to build central institutions.</p> <p>In Sarajevo yesterday, Mr Petritsch announced the imposition of six laws to strengthen the central state. The laws include the establishment of a state court with jurisdiction in both halves of the country, and a law on pensions - both of which had been stalled by nationalists in the outgoing parliament.</p> <p>Each ethnic group now believes it has lost the war: the Serbs because they failed to prevent the independence of Bosnia from Yugoslavia; the Bosnyaks - the Bosnian Muslims, the largest ethnic group - because of the continued existence of a Serbian republic created by the murder and expulsion of non-Serbs; and the Croats because they feel outnumbered and unheard.</p> <p>But with unemployment running at over 40% in both halves of the country, and the continued exodus of young people, job creation has become the central platform of all parties, even nationalists.</p> <p>Outside a polling station near the centre of the Serbian entity's capital, Banja Luka, people said that the economy had dictated who they had voted for. \"To help our children get jobs, and to live in the prosperity we used to have before the war,\" said one middle-aged woman. She and her husband had split their votes between the economically conservative PDP and the more leftwing SNSD.</p> <p>\"Identity is less and less important here by the day,\" said Dragana Stoisavljevic, a 33-year-old secretary and interpreter. \"People have realised that what they need is a job, and a place on the road to European integration.\"</p> <p>Few are willing to predict how that future might be brought about. As Zeljko Kopanja, editor of the Banja Luka weekly, Nezavisne Novine, says: \"The truth is always buried deep within the Bosnia mountains.\"</p> <p>Mr Kopanja describes the likely winners in the Serbian republic, the SDS, as a terrorist group which should be banned - a feeling shared by the US ambassador to the UN, Richard Holbrooke. Mr Kopanja's own newspaper's investigation into Serb war crimes led to a car bomb attack on him in October last year in which he lost both his legs.</p> <p>Mr Kopanja views the election as an important milestone in turning Bosnia and its neighbours into normal countries again and placing them \"on the reserve bench of the European Union\".</p>",

      "bodyText": "For the first time since the end of the war in Bosnia five years ago, parties not based on ethnic lines look set to win majorities in two of the country's three parliaments following elections this weekend. The need for jobs pushed ethnic issues far down the agenda in Saturday's general election. Bosnia remains split into two entities - the Federation, where most of the Muslim and Croat population live, and the Serbian Republic. It also has a national government which has a say across both entities. In the central parliament, social democrats, conservatives and liberal parties from both entities look set to form a majority coalition without the nationalists. In the Federation, the Social Democratic party, led by a 46-year-old computer science professor, Zlatko Lagumdzija, looks set to win a majority. In the Serb-controlled half, the nationalist Serbian Democratic party (SDS) expects to win but may not have enough seats to rule alone. That should pave the way for Mladen Ivanic's Party of Democratic Progress (PDP) and the prime minister Milorad Dodik's Independent Social Democrats (SNSD) to share power with them. Full results of the elections should become clear once the votes of up to 1m refugees and displaced persons are counted. The Dayton peace accords which brought the war to an end in December 1995 are full of contradictions, allowing considerable power to be held by the two entities, but also the possibility of bolstering the institutions of the central state. Overseeing the rebuilding of Bosnia is the international high representative, the Austrian diplomat Wolfgang Petritsch, who risks appeasing nationalists and alienating progressive forces by not doing enough to build central institutions. In Sarajevo yesterday, Mr Petritsch announced the imposition of six laws to strengthen the central state. The laws include the establishment of a state court with jurisdiction in both halves of the country, and a law on pensions - both of which had been stalled by nationalists in the outgoing parliament. Each ethnic group now believes it has lost the war: the Serbs because they failed to prevent the independence of Bosnia from Yugoslavia; the Bosnyaks - the Bosnian Muslims, the largest ethnic group - because of the continued existence of a Serbian republic created by the murder and expulsion of non-Serbs; and the Croats because they feel outnumbered and unheard. But with unemployment running at over 40% in both halves of the country, and the continued exodus of young people, job creation has become the central platform of all parties, even nationalists. Outside a polling station near the centre of the Serbian entity's capital, Banja Luka, people said that the economy had dictated who they had voted for. \"To help our children get jobs, and to live in the prosperity we used to have before the war,\" said one middle-aged woman. She and her husband had split their votes between the economically conservative PDP and the more leftwing SNSD. \"Identity is less and less important here by the day,\" said Dragana Stoisavljevic, a 33-year-old secretary and interpreter. \"People have realised that what they need is a job, and a place on the road to European integration.\" Few are willing to predict how that future might be brought about. As Zeljko Kopanja, editor of the Banja Luka weekly, Nezavisne Novine, says: \"The truth is always buried deep within the Bosnia mountains.\" Mr Kopanja describes the likely winners in the Serbian republic, the SDS, as a terrorist group which should be banned - a feeling shared by the US ambassador to the UN, Richard Holbrooke. Mr Kopanja's own newspaper's investigation into Serb war crimes led to a car bomb attack on him in October last year in which he lost both his legs. Mr Kopanja views the election as an important milestone in turning Bosnia and its neighbours into normal countries again and placing them \"on the reserve bench of the European Union\".",

      "body": "<p>Typical, isn't it? You wait all year for some decent drama on TV, and then two come along at once. Quite literally at once: <strong> Cold Feet</strong> (ITV) and <strong> The Stretch </strong> (Sky One) occupied the airwaves from 9pm to 11pm on Sunday night, forming a rare quality zone that the rest of the week will be hard pushed to match. </p> <p>The Stretch was Sky One's \"Event Of The Week\" and reunited Leslie Grantham and Anita Dobson for the first time since their EastEnders heyday. While the hype surrounding this \"legendary acting partnership\" had to be taken with a pinch of salt, there was little doubt that Grantham and Dobson still make sparks fly, and have good claim to be regarded as the Spencer Tracey/Katharine Hepburn of the criminal underclasses. </p> <p>Terry Green (Grantham) had been sent down for a murder that he said he didn't commit. This left estranged wife Sam (Dobson) as caretaker manager of his criminal empire. At first she was unsure, and expressed this through facial tics and a largely fawn wardrobe. After half an hour, though, she'd overcome her moral scruples to become The Godmother, striding around in a long black coat and a pashmina, being generally fierce. There was little opportunity for interplay between the principals in this first (of two) episodes, but when they did meet (usually during visiting time) it was magical. Imagine a post-watershed Angie and Den. \"Fuck you, Terry Green, fuck you and the horse you rode in on,\" she spat. Terry was imperturbable. \"You kiss our kids with that mouth?\" he asked, with those infuriating hooded eyes and half-smile that used to enliven Albert Square. </p> <p>Most of Sunday's episode belonged to Dobson, and she grabbed the opportunity with both hands. Confronting her daughter's wife-beating husband, she stripped the varnish off the office panelling with a stream of red-hot invective. Toying with the corrupt police officer who seems to have framed Terry, she went all breathy and girly before delivering a verbal kick in the nuts. Occasionally she huddled, fragile but brave, in the back of a chauffeured car, staring out over bleak London landscapes like a lonely monarch. She even got to sing a song (Sam Green was, we discovered, \"the former dancer and 70s singer\") to welcome Terry home from prison. This took place in the nightclub in which Terry had shares, the sort of place that always features in crime dramas, replete with pole dancers. Pole dancers are getting a lot of TV work these days, as a cipher for criminality. In The Stretch, they even featured in the title sequence. </p> <p>Apart from Grantham and Dobson, there were some tasty cameos and supporting performances.

      "bodyText": "Typical, isn't it? You wait all year for some decent drama on TV, and then two come along at once. Quite literally at once: Cold Feet (ITV) and The Stretch (Sky One) occupied the airwaves from 9pm to 11pm on Sunday night, forming a rare quality zone that the rest of the week will be hard pushed to match. The Stretch was Sky One's \"Event Of The Week\" and reunited Leslie Grantham and Anita Dobson for the first time since their EastEnders heyday. While the hype surrounding this \"legendary acting partnership\" had to be taken with a pinch of salt, there was little doubt that Grantham and Dobson still make sparks fly, and have good claim to be regarded as the Spencer Tracey/Katharine Hepburn of the criminal underclasses. Terry Green (Grantham) had been sent down for a murder that he said he didn't commit. This left estranged wife Sam (Dobson) as caretaker manager of his criminal empire. At first she was unsure, and expressed this through facial tics and a largely fawn wardrobe. After half an hour, though, she'd overcome her moral scruples to become The Godmother, striding around in a long black coat and a pashmina, being generally fierce. There was little opportunity for interplay between the principals in this first (of two) episodes, but when they did meet (usually during visiting time) it was magical. Imagine a post-watershed Angie and Den. \"Fuck you, Terry Green, fuck you and the horse you rode in on,\" she spat. Terry was imperturbable. \"You kiss our kids with that mouth?\" he asked, with those infuriating hooded eyes and half-smile that used to enliven Albert Square. Most of Sunday's episode belonged to Dobson, and she grabbed the opportunity with both hands. Confronting her daughter's wife-beating husband, she stripped the varnish off the office panelling with a stream of red-hot invective. Toying with the corrupt police officer who seems to have framed Terry, she went all breathy and girly before delivering a verbal kick in the nuts. Occasionally she huddled, fragile but brave, in the back of a chauffeured car, staring out over bleak London landscapes like a lonely monarch. She even got to sing a song (Sam Green was, we discovered, \"the former dancer and 70s singer\") to welcome Terry home from prison. This took place in the nightclub in which Terry had shares, the sort of place that always features in crime dramas, replete with pole dancers. Pole dancers are getting a lot of TV work these days, as a cipher for criminality. In The Stretch, they even featured in the title sequence. Apart from Grantham and Dobson, there were some tasty cameos and supporting performances. Luke Goss (yes, that Luke Goss) played a nasty modelling agent, all moisturiser and hair gel, who tried to intimidate our Sam in a posh restaurant. Nicholas Day was all jowly threat as dodgy DCI Frank \"Raquel\" Welch, groping Sam with one hand and faking forensics with the other. Next week, Grantham gets a bigger bite of the cherry; we can only hope that there's a future for Terry and Sam Green thereafter. Cold Feet returned for its third series as lively and as original as ever. At the beginning, it was all looking a bit too much like a life insurance advert, with healthy young couples and obliging toddlers running around in sunny parks.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Jacques Chaban-Delmas, who has died aged 85, was prime minister of France between 1969 and 1972, and played a high-profile role in his country's politics for more than 40 years. He was a leading figure in the Gaullist movements of the fourth and fifth republics and sat in the national assembly almost continuously from 1951 until his death. He was also one of France's most celebrated regional political bosses, using his position as mayor of Bordeaux to build up a network of alliances and clients, which transcended party barriers and led to him becoming known as the Duke of Aquitaine.</p> <p>A man of liberal views, ingratiating charm and inexhaustible energy - he played tennis at international level - Chaban-Delmas possessed driving ambition, and yearned to scale the summits of the state. Yet his 1974 candidature in the presidential election that followed the death of Georges Pompidou failed disastrously, and he never quite overcame the suspicion of his colleagues that he lacked the political substance, and perhaps even the integrity, to be president.</p> <p>Chaban-Delmas was born into a relatively modest Parisian family. Educated at the Lyc\u00e9e Lakanal and, like his political adversary and personal friend Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand at the Ecole libre des Sciences Politiques, he entered the French administration during the Vichy regime. He played a major role in the internal military resistance - Alain Delon played him in the film, Is Paris Burning? - and, at the liberation, was appointed military delegate in General de Gaulle's provisional government.</p> <p>His resistance record gave him the double-barrelled surname he had lacked - \"Chaban\" was his wartime pseudonym - and, more importantly, a powerful launch-pad into postwar French politics. Originally a member of the centrist Radical party, he soon threw in his lot with de Gaulle's anti-fourth republic Rassemblement pour la France, founded in 1947.</p> <p>He also decided to make Bordeaux the basis for his political operations, and became its deputy-mayor. This was an astute choice in that the Bordeaux bourgeoisie needed an authentically patriotic, yet modernising, leader to help it overcome its notably unheroic record during the occupation.</p> <p>Chaban-Delmas quickly demonstrated an ability to ride the two horses of liberal reformism and Gaullist nationalism that became the hallmark of his appeal. On the one hand, he served in several fourth republic governments, including one formed in 1954 by the liberals' hero, Pierre Mendes France; on the other, he was a member of de Gaulle's court in exile, which was happy to ignore constitutional proprieties in order to bring their champion back to power. Thus, as defence minister in the Gaillard government, he participated in the plots and plans which, in 1958, took advantage of the worsening Algerian crisis to bring down the hated fourth republic.</p> <p>With de Gaulle back in power, Chaban-Delmas showed his drive, and his talent to please, by getting himself elected president of the national assembly against the general's own candidate. The truncated role of the assembly in the new republic was not to stop government governing, and he proved a diligent agent of Gaullist power. But he also took care to flatter the susceptibilities of his parliamentary colleagues and develop his reputation as a progressive reformer. In a regime whose characteristic style was repressive authoritarianism, these were substantial assets, especially when allied to a lounge lizard style that led him to be nicknamed Charming Delmas.</p> <p>Surrounded by bright, young civil servants, and even some trade unionists, Chaban-Delmas developed a programme of achievable social reform, which could transcend the rigid absolutes of Gaullism and communism. Although the national assembly was utterly irrelevant to the drama that exploded on to the streets of Paris in May 1968, its president, who used the crisis to launch his Kennedyesque vision of a new society, began to look increasingly attractive to a right, which badly needed to demonstrate that it, too, had a social conscience. Thus he was an obvious choice for prime minister once Pompidou had won the presidential election which followed de Gaulle's resignation in 1969.</p> <p>As prime minister, Chaban-Delmas tried to turn his new-society theories into concrete policies aimed at softening the harshnesses of France's system of social relations. With the help of a reformist socialist, Jacques Delors, he introduced measures to liberalise an authoritarian broadcasting network and improve industrial relations, which were characterised on both sides by sullen ill-will.</p> <p>Unlike any of his predecessors, he visited the downside of France's much trumpeted economic miracle, the dreadful slums around Paris, in which many immigrants had to live. Even Mitterrand acknowledged his sincerity.</p> <p>Yet good fortune soon deserted him. He lacked the personal authority to impose his views on his colleagues; on the parliamentary Gaullist party, which, once the 1968 panic was over, was all for cracking down on lefty subversion; and, above all, on President Pompidou. Urged on by political advisers who detested Chaban- Delmas as an irresponsible reformer and a frivolous politician, Pompidou rarely concealed his scepticism for what he contempt- uously referred to as the \"so-called new society\", and was irritated by what he saw as its creator's failure to recognise presidential supremacy.</p> <p>By 1972, Chaban-Delmas's government was in trouble, and he, himself, was under attack. After the poor result of the referendum on British membership of the EEC, Pompidou demonstrated his displeasure by depriving him of all responsibility for broadcasting. In May, Chaban-Delmas tried to consolidate his position by asking for, and getting, a massive vote of confidence from the national assembly. But he failed to obtain presidential approval for this act of independence, and, six weeks later, Pompidou sacked him. It was a brutal demonstration of where real power lay in the fifth republic.</p> <p>Out of office, Chaban-Delmas sought to establish himself as heir apparent to the Gaullist legacy - or, to put it more bluntly, as the natural successor to the dying Pompidou. Once again, however, things went wrong. While he was still prime minister, the Canard Enchain\u00e9 newspaper had revealed that he had used tax breaks to pay no tax for several years, an omission which, though perfectly legal, cast a shadow over his claims to desire a socially more united France, and came on top of a series of corruption scandals which damaged the credibility of the Gaullist governing class.</p> <p>His innumerable sexual conquests, another point in common with Mitterrand, went uncriticised, but the messy circumstances surrounding the end of his second marriage accorded ill with the conserv-ative morality to which ordinary Gaullists clung.</p> <p>Things unravelled rapidly after Pompidou died in April 1974. Chaban-Delmas was never convincing on television, and the speed with which he announced his presidential candidacy, even before Pompidou was in his grave, offended many. He also came up against the implacable enmity of the dead president's advisers, and, in particular, of Jacques Chirac, who held the key post of interior minister. Chirac has some claim to be regarded as his political assassin since he ruthlessly used his office to discredit Chaban-Delmas's electoral credibility, and to advance the cause of the rival conservative candidate, Valery Giscard d'Estaing.</p> <p>By the end of the first-round campaign, the former prophet of the new society looked as archaic as the Gaullist old guard, whose prisoner he appeared to be. In a phrase that became famous, the journalist Francoise Giroud observed that to criticise his campaign was like firing at an ambulance. In the first ballot, he obtained only 15% of the vote, and was eliminated from the contest.</p> <p>It was the end of Chaban-Delmas's presidential ambitions, but not of his career. He was still the boss of Bordeaux, and remained an avid player in the political game. He kept on preaching the virtues of the new society, in the hope that that their reasonableness, and his ability to transcend party lines, might yet bring him office.</p> <p>To an extent, his hopes were realised. In 1978, he regained the national assembly presidency as the candidate of his erstwhile rival, Giscard, against that of his irreconcilable enemy, Chirac; and, in 1986, his name was again cited as a possible prime minister in the new climate produced by the need for cooperation between a socialist president and a rightwing assembly. Nothing came of it, but he returned, for the last time, to the national assembly presidency.</p> <p>By the 1990s, Chaban-Delmas's control over Aquitaine was weakening. Ill health forced him to give up Bordeaux town hall in 1995, after a period in which he had cut a faintly ridiculous figure, endlessly running up stairs when the television cameras were present to prove that his youthful dynamism was intact. There were also signs that his management would not be spared its share of corruption scandals.</p> <p>If Chaban-Delmas's national policy achievement was slender, his record in Bordeaux shows how much boss politics can achieve in big-city France. For a time, he had managed to present a more attractive face of Gaullism than that offered by many of his rivals, and the pragmatic reformism of the new society has lasted better than the grandiloquent alternatives with which it was unfavourably compared in the early 1970s.</p> <p>Although he lacked the ruthlessness of Mitterrand, there were some similarities between their personal and political styles. This may help to explain why Chaban-Delmas was never fully acceptable to the hard men of power who turned Gaullism from a heroic myth into a conservative party.</p> <p>He is survived by the last of his three wives and by his four children.</p> <p>Jacques Pierre Michel Chaban-Delmas, politician, born March 7 1915; died November 10 2000</p>",

But he also took care to flatter the susceptibilities of his parliamentary colleagues and develop his reputation as a progressive reformer. In a regime whose characteristic style was repressive authoritarianism, these were substantial assets, especially when allied to a lounge lizard style that led him to be nicknamed Charming Delmas. Surrounded by bright, young civil servants, and even some trade unionists, Chaban-Delmas developed a programme of achievable social reform, which could transcend the rigid absolutes of Gaullism and communism. Although the national assembly was utterly irrelevant to the drama that exploded on to the streets of Paris in May 1968, its president, who used the crisis to launch his Kennedyesque vision of a new society, began to look increasingly attractive to a right, which badly needed to demonstrate that it, too, had a social conscience. Thus he was an obvious choice for prime minister once Pompidou had won the presidential election which followed de Gaulle's resignation in 1969. As prime minister, Chaban-Delmas tried to turn his new-society theories into concrete policies aimed at softening the harshnesses of France's system of social relations. With the help of a reformist socialist, Jacques Delors, he introduced measures to liberalise an authoritarian broadcasting network and improve industrial relations, which were characterised on both sides by sullen ill-will. Unlike any of his predecessors, he visited the downside of France's much trumpeted economic miracle, the dreadful slums around Paris, in which many immigrants had to live. Even Mitterrand acknowledged his sincerity. Yet good fortune soon deserted him. He lacked the personal authority to impose his views on his colleagues; on the parliamentary Gaullist party, which, once the 1968 panic was over, was all for cracking down on lefty subversion; and, above all, on President Pompidou. Urged on by political advisers who detested Chaban- Delmas as an irresponsible reformer and a frivolous politician, Pompidou rarely concealed his scepticism for what he contempt- uously referred to as the \"so-called new society\", and was irritated by what he saw as its creator's failure to recognise presidential supremacy. By 1972, Chaban-Delmas's government was in trouble, and he, himself, was under attack. After the poor result of the referendum on British membership of the EEC, Pompidou demonstrated his displeasure by depriving him of all responsibility for broadcasting. In May, Chaban-Delmas tried to consolidate his position by asking for, and getting, a massive vote of confidence from the national assembly. But he failed to obtain presidential approval for this act of independence, and, six weeks later, Pompidou sacked him. It was a brutal demonstration of where real power lay in the fifth republic. Out of office, Chaban-Delmas sought to establish himself as heir apparent to the Gaullist legacy - or, to put it more bluntly, as the natural successor to the dying Pompidou. Once again, however, things went wrong. While he was still prime minister, the Canard Enchain\u00e9 newspaper had revealed that he had used tax breaks to pay no tax for several years, an omission which, though perfectly legal, cast a shadow over his claims to desire a socially more united France, and came on top of a series of corruption scandals which damaged the credibility of the Gaullist governing class. His innumerable sexual conquests, another point in common with Mitterrand, went uncriticised, but the messy circumstances surrounding the end of his second marriage accorded ill with the conserv-ative morality to which ordinary Gaullists clung. Things unravelled rapidly after Pompidou died in April 1974. Chaban-Delmas was never convincing on television, and the speed with which he announced his presidential candidacy, even before Pompidou was in his grave, offended many. He also came up against the implacable enmity of the dead president's advisers, and, in particular, of Jacques Chirac, who held the key post of interior minister. Chirac has some claim to be regarded as his political assassin since he ruthlessly used his office to discredit Chaban-Delmas's electoral credibility, and to advance the cause of the rival conservative candidate, Valery Giscard d'Estaing. By the end of the first-round campaign, the former prophet of the new society looked as archaic as the Gaullist old guard, whose prisoner he appeared to be. In a phrase that became famous, the journalist Francoise Giroud observed that to criticise his campaign was like firing at an ambulance. In the first ballot, he obtained only 15% of the vote, and was eliminated from the contest. It was the end of Chaban-Delmas's presidential ambitions, but not of his career. He was still the boss of Bordeaux, and remained an avid player in the political game. He kept on preaching the virtues of the new society, in the hope that that their reasonableness, and his ability to transcend party lines, might yet bring him office. To an extent, his hopes were realised. In 1978, he regained the national assembly presidency as the candidate of his erstwhile rival, Giscard, against that of his irreconcilable enemy, Chirac; and, in 1986, his name was again cited as a possible prime minister in the new climate produced by the need for cooperation between a socialist president and a rightwing assembly. Nothing came of it, but he returned, for the last time, to the national assembly presidency. By the 1990s, Chaban-Delmas's control over Aquitaine was weakening. Ill health forced him to give up Bordeaux town hall in 1995, after a period in which he had cut a faintly ridiculous figure, endlessly running up stairs when the television cameras were present to prove that his youthful dynamism was intact. There were also signs that his management would not be spared its share of corruption scandals. If Chaban-Delmas's national policy achievement was slender, his record in Bordeaux shows how much boss politics can achieve in big-city France. For a time, he had managed to present a more attractive face of Gaullism than that offered by many of his rivals, and the pragmatic reformism of the new society has lasted better than the grandiloquent alternatives with which it was unfavourably compared in the early 1970s. Although he lacked the ruthlessness of Mitterrand, there were some similarities between their personal and political styles. This may help to explain why Chaban-Delmas was never fully acceptable to the hard men of power who turned Gaullism from a heroic myth into a conservative party. He is survived by the last of his three wives and by his four children. Jacques Pierre Michel Chaban-Delmas, politician, born March 7 1915; died November 10 2000",

She works as a staff nurse.</b> <p> <b> 6.30am</b> I get up and start getting everything ready for the children. This is the quietest time of the whole day for me. I separated from my partner two years ago and at the same time Sebastian became ill with ME. </p> <p> <b> 6.45am</b> I wake Sebastian up. He is making progress and has gone back to school but I never know how he'll be in the morning. Sometimes he has aches and pains but today he doesn't seem too bad. This is the time of day when the children are most likely to tell me things - it also happens to be the most inconvenient time to listen. </p> <p> <b> 7.30am</b> To the bus stop to drop Sebastian off, then it's back home and Tippi gets ready for school and I get ready for work. Drop Tippi off, park my car nearby and walk one and a half miles to the hospital - there's never any parking there. </p> <p> <b> 9.30am</b> I start work on the colo-rectal surgical ward. It's physically demanding and emotionally draining because a lot of the patients have cancer, so they need lots of support. </p> <p> <b> 3pm</b> Grabbed a 15-minute break and a sandwich a couple of hours ago, but by now I'm on my knees. It's an extremely busy ward and a lot of the care is very technical: pumps, drips, drains and epidurals. The patients really appreciate the little things you do for them. I washed one's feet and cleaned her teeth, and managed to arrange a wheelchair so a man who's been here since September can have a day out with his family. </p> <p> <b> 3.30pm</b> Pick up Tippi, then Sebastian, then go home for half an hour's quiet time. I'm lucky because my ward manager has been wonderful about allowing me to work flexible hours to fit around school. </p> <p> <b> 4.30pm</b> Supervise homework, prepare food and get the children ready for bed. It all takes a long time. </p> <p> <b> 9.30pm</b> I've read a story and now the children are in bed. I try not to let the day's tasks drag on much longer. I feel tired most of the time. </p> <p> <b> Claire Curtis-Thomas, Labour MP for Crosby, lives in Liverpool with husband Michael, niece Angel, 17, and children Georgina, 12, Carla, 10, and Lewis, two.</b> </p> <p> <b> 1am</b> Carla has got food poisoning and is projectile vomiting. I clean her up and change her sheets. </p> <p> <b> 6.30am</b> Eight changes of sheets later, I emerge from Carla's room to see to the other children, making sure they're bathed and dressed and ready for school and nursery. Meanwhile Michael deals with the night's washing and looks after Carla. </p> <p> <b> 8.30am</b> The children go to school. I have to delay travelling to Westminster to take Carla to the doctor while Michael collects the others from school. He's given up work so he can stay at home and look after the children while I commute to parliament. I phone Westminster to say I'll be later than expected. </p> <p> <b> 4.30pm</b> I finally leave for London. On a normal day, I'm in the office first thing and spend the first two or three hours going through all the correspondence that has arrived. No time to grab any food. </p> <p> <b> 11.30pm</b> It takes me seven hours to travel down today, but I do answer 60 constituents' letters on the train. The kids call me on the mobile, asking me to arbitrate on a row over who has possession of the TV remote control. I've missed the meetings, debates and committees I'd normally attend during the day, but I'm still in time for a late sitting which doesn't finish until after 2am. We usually get one night a week when the debate ends at 10pm but then there can be eight votes that take you up to midnight. The other nights, business can go on until 2am, 3am or even 4am. I don't think keeping these hours does anything for the quality of the debate - and it takes me a month during recess to get over it. I'm looking forward to the concession on hours which means we'll finish at 10pm. This situation is very wearing for everyone and my children can't escape the stress. It's said finishing at 10pm is family-friendly but it's pretty strange families that work until 10 every night. I don't see why we can't work 9-5. </p> <p> <b> Mya Elmalem is a single parent who lives in London with four-year-old Jake. She has a full-time job as a youth worker and is also studying for a distance learning degree in informal and community education.</b> </p> <p> <b> 7.30am</b> The mornings are the part of the day I find hardest with Jake because he always says he doesn't want to go to school and refuses to get dressed. Today I go through the usual performance with him. He just sits on the sofa and refuses to get ready. I shout at him because we're going to be late. </p> <p> <b> 9.30am </b> Back home from school and time to study for my degree. I have to be very disciplined about getting my work done. It's a nightmare combining this with the youth work job, which is 35 hours a week, and looking after Jake, but I know it will be worth it in the end. I'm 21 now but when I'm 25 and Jake is eight, I will have my degree and will be able to walk into a well-paid job in youth work which could mean much more civilised hours than the ones I work now - usually afternoons, some evenings and some weekends. </p> <p> <b> 3pm</b> I go to work and Jake goes to an after-school club. Then he is picked up by his childminder. She collects him two days a week, I collect him two days a week and my mum collects him one day a week. I do get support from my family but I also pay out a fortune in childcare and it takes army precision to make sure that everything is sorted out for Jake and I get my work done. Work is very busy. Today I'm doing cooking with a group of boys. Many of them have never even picked up a can opener before and nobody's tried to teach them because they can be quite wild. </p> <p> <b> 10pm</b> I finally get home. Jake won't go to sleep until he's seen me and his bedtime is the best part of the day because everything is more relaxed. I read him lots of stories: his favourite is Guess How Much I Love You. </p> <p> <b> 11pm</b> The day finally ends. I try to study for a little while, but I'm exhausted. I know my life won't always be this stressed but this is the way I have to live for the next four years if I want to improve things for Jake and myself. </p> <p><b> Alison Dishington lives in London with husband Neil, who works with computers in a city bank, and Izzy, six, James, five, and Matthew, two. She does not go out to work.</b> </p> <p> <b> 7am </b> Matthew comes into our bedroom to wake us up. I go downstairs with him because I don't want him to wake the other two children up yet. </p> <p> <b> 7.30am</b> Izzy and James come down for breakfast, then disappear back upstairs and I have to hound them to get dressed while I do their lunchboxes. We finally leave for school and just make it for the 8.50 bell. </p> <p> <b> 9am</b> I do something with Matthew most mornings, take him to a music group or mother and toddler group. I think it's important for him to socialise with children his own age, so it's back to horrible-coffee-and-disgusting-biscuit mornings. </p> <p> <b> 2pm</b> Matthew goes to sleep. This is an oasis in the day and it's nice just to have the silence. I can shower, make calls and cook without having the children round my ankles . Before I had them, I worked for a company that makes wedding dresses. I kept on a bit of work for them after Izzy was born, but once James arrived I simply didn't have the time. </p> <p> <b> 3.20pm</b> Matthew wakes up and we collect Izzy and James from school. James has one of his friends over and I help them make chocolate crispie cakes, which they love. I'm getting lots of questions from all of them about when Christmas is - they don't have any real sense of time, so don't realise it's a way off yet. </p> <p> <b> 6.45pm</b> Bathtime. I find the hours after school go so quickly, especially now they have things to do at home. I listen to Izzy read and try to have them in bed by 7.30pm. This is about the time Neil gets home, so he doesn't always see them before bedtime. </p> <p> <b> 8pm</b> Neil and I have a meal, then listen to music or watch TV, and before we know it, it's bedtime. The time just flies by. When Izzy and James were little, we used to take life as it came and it didn't matter if we were still in our pyjamas at noon but now school is a factor we can't take things that casually any more.</p>",

Its latest manifestation is Bush buddy James Baker's outrageous bid to persuade Miami's federal court to block a full manual recount in Palm Beach county today. Mr Baker, openly suggesting that local poll officials may fiddle the outcome, also wants a halt to recounts elsewhere. This is a blatant attempt to thwart an accurate return in a state election awash with irregularities. What are the Republicans scared of? Judging by a partial manual recount in Palm Beach that showed Democrat Al Gore gaining votes, and given that the nationally decisive, state-wide margin between him and George W Bush is down to about 283, the answer is plain.</p> <p>What has happened to the Republicans' oft-repeated argument that voters, not lawyers, should decide last Tuesday's presidential election? By becoming the first of the two parties to take federal court action, George W Bush and his advisers perform a complete volte-face after claiming to be guided by lofty, altruistic principles. They are terrified that the final, official, certified Florida result, whenever it comes, may go against them. Hence Mr Baker's desire for a quick, unrevised verdict and his sudden concern about \"human error\". Mr Baker should know all about the latter.

      "bodyText": "Fight the Florida fix. Its latest manifestation is Bush buddy James Baker's outrageous bid to persuade Miami's federal court to block a full manual recount in Palm Beach county today. Mr Baker, openly suggesting that local poll officials may fiddle the outcome, also wants a halt to recounts elsewhere. This is a blatant attempt to thwart an accurate return in a state election awash with irregularities. What are the Republicans scared of? Judging by a partial manual recount in Palm Beach that showed Democrat Al Gore gaining votes, and given that the nationally decisive, state-wide margin between him and George W Bush is down to about 283, the answer is plain. What has happened to the Republicans' oft-repeated argument that voters, not lawyers, should decide last Tuesday's presidential election? By becoming the first of the two parties to take federal court action, George W Bush and his advisers perform a complete volte-face after claiming to be guided by lofty, altruistic principles. They are terrified that the final, official, certified Florida result, whenever it comes, may go against them. Hence Mr Baker's desire for a quick, unrevised verdict and his sudden concern about \"human error\". Mr Baker should know all about the latter. It was his hapless campaign strategy that cost George Bush Snr his re-election bid in 1992 and ushered in eight years of Clinton-Gore. Fight the Florida fix. Palm Beach aside, evidence of malpractice grows in poor, urban, Democratic-inclined Miami-Dade, an area with a history of fraud, and two other counties. These are not wild claims.

A hospital spokeswoman said: \"He is not an in-patient at the moment.\" Sir Martin Rees, astronomer royal and a colleague, said yesterday that Prof Hawking appeared to be well a week ago, and showed no sign of injuries. He is looked after at his Cambridge home by private nurses. In 1990 he left Jane, his wife of 25 years and mother of their three children, to live with his nurse, Elaine Mason, the wife of the computer engineer who designed his voice synthesiser. They married in 1995.",

It took over a millennium and a half of Christianity before any return to the Greeks' supremacy in science, literature and democracy. As to human rights, while some Christians have obviously supported them, all too often their institutions have opposed them - and still do. Such institutions still treat women as inferior, and tell gays they should have no sex life. Some, perhaps most, Anglican bishops want Christian values to override human rights and voted (unsuccessfully) against the churches being subject to the Human Rights Act in the House of Lords. Keith Porteous Wood General secretary, National Secular Society \u0095 Modern international human rights law is no more \"a Christian gift\", as Hywel Williams puts it, than it is a threat to Christian values, as some bishops would have it. The 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights was a response to the descent into barbarism which culminated in the second world war. Its profound moral vision reflected the diverse influences of its drafters, including all the main religions, Confucianism, liberalism, communitarianism, socialism and social democracy. It is partly for this reason that human rights values can be embraced by those of any religion and of none. Francesca Klug Academic director, Human Rights Act Research Unit, King's College, London \u0095 So that's what the Inquisition was doing - defending human rights! And I thought they were just persecuting subversives. Hywel Williams's partial and comforting view of the history of Christianity misses out all of the appalling suffering inflicted in its name and fails to engage with the central argument of Joan Smith's piece (So the British have become atheists, October 30) which is that all religions deal in fairy tales. The fact that Christianity may or may not have incidentally contributed some ideas that, in their time, were socially progressive, doesn't make the principal tenets of its belief system any less nonsensical for most people today than any other religion. Jeff Wells London \u0095 If Christianity were true, it wouldn't be so easy to make fun of. David McKeegan Coventry dave@mckeegan.u-net.com",

      "byline": "Clare Dyer",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In just a few months, the two young men who killed the toddler James Bulger will slip out of the secure units in the north of England which have been their homes for the past eight years. They will begin new lives in different parts of the country with new identities and carefully manufactured histories designed to obliterate all traces of the past.</p> <p>The photographs of their 10-year-old selves, endlessly recycled in the media's iconography of evil, bear little resemblance to the stocky 18-year-olds they have become. But will the edifice built to protect them from exposure to the mob hold up? Ralph Bulger, James's father, has vowed to hunt them down, and the tabloids which called for them to be locked up for life are not going to forget them. \"Recent experience tells us that if they were to be named and shamed by the media it would put them, and anyone else who resembles them, at grave risk of vigilante attacks,\" said Rob Allen, director of research at Nacro, the National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders.</p> <p>Today, lawyers for Robert Thompson and Jon Venables will ask the high court to impose a \"Mary Bell\" order - a permanent injunction banning the media from revealing the slightest detail of their new lives, names or whereabouts.</p> <p>The pair could be released as early as February, and the construction of their new life stories has already begun. If they succeed, they will live out the rest of their lives under a shroud of secrecy, their true identities hidden from all but a handful of people. \"If Thompson and Venables win, the effect will be to prohibit anyone from naming them or photographing them,\"says Martin Partington, a solicitor for Trinity Mirror, one of the newspaper groups fighting the injunction. \"They will effectively become non-people.\"</p> <p>No criminal leaving custody has had such protection before. The blanket ban protecting Mary Bell, jailed aged 11 in 1968 for the murder of two small children and released 12 years later, was actually granted to safeguard her daughter, who was made a ward of court and is still under 18. There is no precedent in English law for a court to grant such a ban to protect an adult. Indeed, it seemed questionable whether there was any mechanism for doing it - at least until last month, when the Human Rights Act came into force.</p> <p>The act made the European Convention on Human Rights part of English law, creating for the first time a right of privacy enforceable in our courts. But the convention also enshrines a right to freedom of expression. Lawyers have been keenly awaiting the first big test case to see how the English courts would deal with the clash between the right of privacy and the media's right to inform the public. Few foresaw that the first beneficiaries would be not pop stars or politicians but child killers.</p> <p>Since their trial in 1993, Thompson and Venables have been protected by an injunction imposed by the trial judge, Mr Justice Morland, banning the media from publishing their whereabouts or any details of their daily lives. Last July, as their 18th birthdays loomed, four newspaper groups went to the high court to clarify what would happen to that injunction when the pair came of age. Would it automatically lapse? The president of the high court's family division, Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, ruled that the injunction should stay in place until today's three-day hearing. The case is seen as so important for the penal system and the protection of young offenders that separate legal teams will represent the Home Office, the attorney-general and the official solicitor, as well as Thompson, Venables and the newspapers.</p> <p>In deciding cases that raise human rights issues, our courts have to take account of case law from the European court of human rights in Strasbourg, though they need not follow it slavishly. Judgments from Strasbourg show that the court rates privacy as an important right, but puts the right to free speech higher, as an essential safeguard in a democratic society.</p> <p>Our senior judges, however, have been keen to carve out a right of privacy since the case of Gorden Kaye, the 'Allo 'Allo actor who was ambushed in his hospital bed by a Sunday Sport reporter and photographer while still heavily sedated after an accident. In that case, the judges reluctantly decided there was nothing they could do. Now there is something they can do and Thompson and Venables may be the first to reap the benefit.</p> <p>Apart from the right to privacy, the European convention on human rights expressly allows limits on freedom of expression to prevent \"the disclosure of information received in confidence\". The English courts have in recent years begun to impose a duty of confidence on snoopers who obtain information by unethical means, such as trespass, listening devices or long-lens cameras.</p> <p>In addition to these arguments, Venables' QC, Edward Fitzgerald - who also represents Myra Hindley - produced a novel suggestion at the July hearing that the injunction could be justified to protect the statutory right of offenders to rehabilitation. Dame Elizabeth, who will preside over this week's hearing, described that as \"a most interesting question which has not yet been addressed by any court to my knowledge\".</p> <p>Should Thompson and Venables win, the way could be open for those other icons of evil, Myra Hindley and Rosemary West, if they ever regain their freedom, to disappear from our sight. Partington says: \"The Thompson and Venables case could make new law because there has never been a situation where people have effectively asked a court to sanction them not to be people any more. It's quite a dangerous precedent. If juveniles who commit serious crimes and are not released till they are adults are given anonymity, why shouldn't everyone have it?\"</p> <p>The Strasbourg court has not had to rule on many clashes between the rights of privacy and freedom of expression. The closest to Thompson and Venables' case may be Z v Finland, in which the court held that the right to privacy of a woman with HIV was violated when her name, linked with the infection, was mentioned in a court judgment passed to the press. Her lawyers had argued that the revelation had dramatically affected her private and family life by exposing her to opprobrium and the risk of ostracism.</p> <p>In Thompson and Venables' case, exposure could not only endanger their chances of rehabilitation and a normal life; it could put their lives at risk from revenge attacks. But protecting them may not be so simple. What about the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act, which will oblige them to reveal their murder conviction to any prospective employer?</p> <p>And in the internet age, is it even possible to become a non-person? A high court injunction would ban the media in England and Wales from blowing their cover. Separate injunctions could cover Scotland and Northern Ireland. But there would be nothing to stop anonymous postings on foreign websites, or stories in any of the thousands of foreign newspapers whose online editions are freely accessible to readers here. Judges in the case of the conjoined twins Jodie and Mary allowed the press to reveal that their parents came from Gozo after learning that the information was freely available on the internet.</p> <p>Whatever the outcome, the Thompson and Venables case could go all the way to the House of Lords. Lord Bingham, now the senior law lord, revealed his views in a lecture four years ago. He believed the law should protect personal privacy, but \"the right must be narrowly drawn, to give full effect to the right of free speech and the public's right to know\". He concluded, however: \"I think it almost inevitable that cases will arise in which the need to give relief is obvious and pressing; and when such cases do arise, I do not think the courts will be found wanting.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "In just a few months, the two young men who killed the toddler James Bulger will slip out of the secure units in the north of England which have been their homes for the past eight years. They will begin new lives in different parts of the country with new identities and carefully manufactured histories designed to obliterate all traces of the past. The photographs of their 10-year-old selves, endlessly recycled in the media's iconography of evil, bear little resemblance to the stocky 18-year-olds they have become. But will the edifice built to protect them from exposure to the mob hold up? Ralph Bulger, James's father, has vowed to hunt them down, and the tabloids which called for them to be locked up for life are not going to forget them. \"Recent experience tells us that if they were to be named and shamed by the media it would put them, and anyone else who resembles them, at grave risk of vigilante attacks,\" said Rob Allen, director of research at Nacro, the National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders. Today, lawyers for Robert Thompson and Jon Venables will ask the high court to impose a \"Mary Bell\" order - a permanent injunction banning the media from revealing the slightest detail of their new lives, names or whereabouts. The pair could be released as early as February, and the construction of their new life stories has already begun. If they succeed, they will live out the rest of their lives under a shroud of secrecy, their true identities hidden from all but a handful of people. \"If Thompson and Venables win, the effect will be to prohibit anyone from naming them or photographing them,\"says Martin Partington, a solicitor for Trinity Mirror, one of the newspaper groups fighting the injunction. \"They will effectively become non-people.\" No criminal leaving custody has had such protection before. The blanket ban protecting Mary Bell, jailed aged 11 in 1968 for the murder of two small children and released 12 years later, was actually granted to safeguard her daughter, who was made a ward of court and is still under 18. There is no precedent in English law for a court to grant such a ban to protect an adult. Indeed, it seemed questionable whether there was any mechanism for doing it - at least until last month, when the Human Rights Act came into force. The act made the European Convention on Human Rights part of English law, creating for the first time a right of privacy enforceable in our courts. But the convention also enshrines a right to freedom of expression. Lawyers have been keenly awaiting the first big test case to see how the English courts would deal with the clash between the right of privacy and the media's right to inform the public. Few foresaw that the first beneficiaries would be not pop stars or politicians but child killers. Since their trial in 1993, Thompson and Venables have been protected by an injunction imposed by the trial judge, Mr Justice Morland, banning the media from publishing their whereabouts or any details of their daily lives. Last July, as their 18th birthdays loomed, four newspaper groups went to the high court to clarify what would happen to that injunction when the pair came of age. Would it automatically lapse? The president of the high court's family division, Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, ruled that the injunction should stay in place until today's three-day hearing. The case is seen as so important for the penal system and the protection of young offenders that separate legal teams will represent the Home Office, the attorney-general and the official solicitor, as well as Thompson, Venables and the newspapers. In deciding cases that raise human rights issues, our courts have to take account of case law from the European court of human rights in Strasbourg, though they need not follow it slavishly. Judgments from Strasbourg show that the court rates privacy as an important right, but puts the right to free speech higher, as an essential safeguard in a democratic society. Our senior judges, however, have been keen to carve out a right of privacy since the case of Gorden Kaye, the 'Allo 'Allo actor who was ambushed in his hospital bed by a Sunday Sport reporter and photographer while still heavily sedated after an accident. In that case, the judges reluctantly decided there was nothing they could do. Now there is something they can do and Thompson and Venables may be the first to reap the benefit. Apart from the right to privacy, the European convention on human rights expressly allows limits on freedom of expression to prevent \"the disclosure of information received in confidence\". The English courts have in recent years begun to impose a duty of confidence on snoopers who obtain information by unethical means, such as trespass, listening devices or long-lens cameras. In addition to these arguments, Venables' QC, Edward Fitzgerald - who also represents Myra Hindley - produced a novel suggestion at the July hearing that the injunction could be justified to protect the statutory right of offenders to rehabilitation. Dame Elizabeth, who will preside over this week's hearing, described that as \"a most interesting question which has not yet been addressed by any court to my knowledge\". Should Thompson and Venables win, the way could be open for those other icons of evil, Myra Hindley and Rosemary West, if they ever regain their freedom, to disappear from our sight. Partington says: \"The Thompson and Venables case could make new law because there has never been a situation where people have effectively asked a court to sanction them not to be people any more. It's quite a dangerous precedent. If juveniles who commit serious crimes and are not released till they are adults are given anonymity, why shouldn't everyone have it?\" The Strasbourg court has not had to rule on many clashes between the rights of privacy and freedom of expression. The closest to Thompson and Venables' case may be Z v Finland, in which the court held that the right to privacy of a woman with HIV was violated when her name, linked with the infection, was mentioned in a court judgment passed to the press. Her lawyers had argued that the revelation had dramatically affected her private and family life by exposing her to opprobrium and the risk of ostracism. In Thompson and Venables' case, exposure could not only endanger their chances of rehabilitation and a normal life; it could put their lives at risk from revenge attacks. But protecting them may not be so simple. What about the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act, which will oblige them to reveal their murder conviction to any prospective employer? And in the internet age, is it even possible to become a non-person? A high court injunction would ban the media in England and Wales from blowing their cover. Separate injunctions could cover Scotland and Northern Ireland. But there would be nothing to stop anonymous postings on foreign websites, or stories in any of the thousands of foreign newspapers whose online editions are freely accessible to readers here. Judges in the case of the conjoined twins Jodie and Mary allowed the press to reveal that their parents came from Gozo after learning that the information was freely available on the internet. Whatever the outcome, the Thompson and Venables case could go all the way to the House of Lords. Lord Bingham, now the senior law lord, revealed his views in a lecture four years ago. He believed the law should protect personal privacy, but \"the right must be narrowly drawn, to give full effect to the right of free speech and the public's right to know\". He concluded, however: \"I think it almost inevitable that cases will arise in which the need to give relief is obvious and pressing; and when such cases do arise, I do not think the courts will be found wanting.\"",

Manufacturers now label domestic appliances to show how much energy each product uses - from the most efficient to the least. Changing to environmentally friendly electricity - green electricity - will help decrease our dependency on fossil fuels. As Europe's largest wildlife conservation organisation with over a million members, the RSPB decided to do our bit and launched our own \"green energy\" scheme. This scheme, in conjunction with Scottish and Southern Energy, supplies electricity from 100% renewable sources. Half of the \"green electricity\" comes from existing hydro plants and the rest from existing wind, sewage and gas landfill. We are actively looking for opportunities for our own nature reserves to produce green electricity - particularly through solar and wind power. Everyone wants to live in a cleaner, healthier world. Most people want to help the environment. But it isn't easy - it requires genuine lifestyle changes - the way we live, work and behave. Let no one doubt the power of the consumer to change things. Because climate change is largely man made, we can all do our bit to limit it. One of the simplest options is to switch to using energy from renewable sources. These will be big steps towards helping the environment and our wildlife. Useful link RSPB and green electricity",

Here we list the five definitions published by the agency. </p> <p>Certificate level</p> <p>The holder of a Certificate of Higher Education will have a sound knowledge of the basic concepts of a subject, and will have learned how to take different approaches to solving problems. He or she will be able to communicate accurately, and will have the qualities needed for employment requiring the exercise of some personal responsibility. A Certificate may be a first step towards obtaining higher level qualifications.</p> <p>Intermediate level</p> <p>Holders of qualifications at this level will have developed a sound understanding of the principles in their field of study, and will have learned to apply those principles more widely. Through this, they will have learned to evaluate the appropriateness of different approaches to solving problems. Their studies may well have had a vocational orientation, enabling them to perform effectively in their chosen field. They will have the qualities necessary for employment in situations requiring the exercise of personal responsibility and decision making. The intermediate level includes higher diplomas, ordinary (non-honours) degrees, and the Foundation Degree.</p> <p>Honours level</p> <p>An honours graduate will have developed an understanding of a complex body of knowledge, some of it at the current boundaries of an academic discipline. Through this, the graduate will have developed analytical techniques and problem solving skills that can be applied in many types of employment. The graduate will be able to evaluate evidence, arguments and assumptions, to reach sound judgements, and to communicate effectively. An honours graduate should have the qualities needed for employment in situations requiring the exercise of personal responsibility, and decision making in complex and unpredictable circumstances. Honours degrees form the largest group of higher education qualifications. Typical courses last for three years (if taken full time) and lead to a Bachelors degree with honours, having a title such as Bachelor of Arts (BA) or Bachelor of Science (BSc). Also at this level are short courses and professional 'conversion' courses, based largely on undergraduate material, and taken usually by those who are already graduates in another discipline, leading to Graduate Certificates or Diplomas.</p> <p>Masters level</p> <p>Much of the study undertaken at Masters level will have been at, or informed by, the forefront of an academic or professional discipline. Students will have shown originality in the application of knowledge, and they will understand how the boundaries of knowledge are advanced through research. They will be able to deal with complex issues both systematically and creatively, and they will show originality in tackling and solving problems. They will have the qualities needed for employment in circumstances requiring sound judgement, personal responsibility and initiative in complex and unpredictable professional environments. Masters degrees are awarded after completion of taught courses, programmes of research, or a mixture of both. Longer, research based programmes often lead to the degree of MPhil. Most Masters courses are taken by honours graduates, but some Masters degrees in science and engineering are awarded after extended undergraduate programmes that last, typically, a year longer than honours degree programmes. Also at this level are advanced short courses, often forming parts of Continuing Professional Development programmes, leading to Postgraduate Certificates and Diplomas. (NB The MAs granted by the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge are not academic qualifications.)</p> <p>Doctoral level</p> <p>Doctorates are awarded for the creation and interpretation of knowledge, which extends the forefront of a discipline, usually through original research. Holders of doctorates will be able to conceptualise, design and implement projects for the generation of significant new knowledge and/or understanding. Holders of doctorates will have the qualities needed for employment requiring the ability to make informed judgements on complex issues in specialist fields, and innovation in tackling and solving problems. The titles PhD and DPhil are commonly used for doctorates awarded on the basis of original research. Doctoral programmes with a substantial taught element lead usually to degrees that include the name of the discipline in their title (eg EdD for Doctor of Education).</p> <p> Full details of the new qualifications framework can be found on the QAA's website at: http://www.qaa.ac.uk</p>",

Also at this level are short courses and professional 'conversion' courses, based largely on undergraduate material, and taken usually by those who are already graduates in another discipline, leading to Graduate Certificates or Diplomas. Masters level Much of the study undertaken at Masters level will have been at, or informed by, the forefront of an academic or professional discipline. Students will have shown originality in the application of knowledge, and they will understand how the boundaries of knowledge are advanced through research. They will be able to deal with complex issues both systematically and creatively, and they will show originality in tackling and solving problems. They will have the qualities needed for employment in circumstances requiring sound judgement, personal responsibility and initiative in complex and unpredictable professional environments. Masters degrees are awarded after completion of taught courses, programmes of research, or a mixture of both. Longer, research based programmes often lead to the degree of MPhil. Most Masters courses are taken by honours graduates, but some Masters degrees in science and engineering are awarded after extended undergraduate programmes that last, typically, a year longer than honours degree programmes. Also at this level are advanced short courses, often forming parts of Continuing Professional Development programmes, leading to Postgraduate Certificates and Diplomas. (NB The MAs granted by the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge are not academic qualifications.) Doctoral level Doctorates are awarded for the creation and interpretation of knowledge, which extends the forefront of a discipline, usually through original research. Holders of doctorates will be able to conceptualise, design and implement projects for the generation of significant new knowledge and/or understanding. Holders of doctorates will have the qualities needed for employment requiring the ability to make informed judgements on complex issues in specialist fields, and innovation in tackling and solving problems. The titles PhD and DPhil are commonly used for doctorates awarded on the basis of original research. Doctoral programmes with a substantial taught element lead usually to degrees that include the name of the discipline in their title (eg EdD for Doctor of Education). Full details of the new qualifications framework can be found on the QAA's website at: http://www.qaa.ac.uk",

And then on Saturday he nearly died. The Parma coach was on the way back from training when he lost control of his car on the motorway. In the resulting crash, he fractured his collar bone and had to be airlifted to hospital. But not even a close encounter with the grim reaper could stop the indefatigable Malesani. \"I stared death in the face but tomorrow I'll be back on the bench,\" he defiantly told reporters from hospital. And so he was. </p> <p>And Parma were able to display the same stubborn qualities as their coach, as they edged past Serie A leaders Udinese with two goals in the last six minutes. </p> <p>Malesani's side, inspired by Portuguese winger Sergio Conceicao, was dominant throughout.

The Lupi were simply too strong, and despite Tiabi's best efforts they scored the winner through Montella after 72 minutes.</p> <p>Afterwards, Reggina's Franco Colomba had nothing but praise for Roma. \"I think we lost to a good team,\" was his gracious assessment. Meanwhile Capello was typically coy, praising Montella as a \"good penalty box player,\" but refusing to say why he has preferred playing Marco Delvecchio alongside Batistuta. \"I try to play the best elements available at any given time,\" he stated, his poker-face giving nothing away.</p> <p>On Saturday the big game between Juventus and Lazio at the Stadio Delle Alpi fizzled out to a 1-1 draw, after Marcello Salas's 25-yard scorcher cancelled out Igor Tudor's opener for Juve. But unfortunately the match will be remembered more for events off the pitch. </p> <p>Sadly, the Lazio fans are at it again - this time directing their racist abuse at Edgar Davids. And then, after the taunting came the violence. During the game TV cameras showed a man being kicked unconscious for several minutes, before the police finally decided to act. An ominous forerunner for England's friendly against Italy - also at the Stadio Delle Alpi - on Wednesday night, perhaps? Elsewhere, lowly Lecce - famous for the garishness of their MCC tie-esque shirts as much as the quality of their football - displayed gladiatorial levels of courage to beat Internazionale in the San Siro for the first time in their history.</p> <p>Things started badly for Lecce when they conceded a penalty after ten minutes, but keeper Antonio Chimenti made a brilliant save to thwart Laurent Blanc. And so the pattern of the match was established: Inter shots, Chimenti saves - and the only time it was broken was in the 21st minute when Davor Vugrinec put Lecce ahead. </p> <p>Incredibly the scored stayed at 1-0, even though Lecce were reduced to ten men just before half-time when Alberto Malusci was sent off for hacking down Sukur.

She didn't disappoint. Vocally she was on glorious form, every note beautifully placed, each inflection expressive, her phrases seamless. Her Katya was a human being rather than a tragic heroine - even in her final scene there were no histrionics. Her interpretation allowed the audience to see to the depths of Katya's vulnerability, and the audience warmed to both character and singer as a result. </p> <p>In this staging, directed by David Edwards, it's not strictly up to the singers to conjure feelings of impending meltdown - Maria Bj\u00f6rnson's designs do that adequately enough. The action takes place in a cold, glistening whirlpool, ready to suck Katya down even before her fate is sealed. A huge, sweeping net curtain hangs in front; at its root this opera is a tragedy of family relationships. David Harvey's wan, chilly lighting only warms around Katya herself. For some reason, amid all this stark abstraction, real horses pull Tikhon's carriage. It's all rather discomforting, and doesn't leave much room for intimacy - but then, in this work all the truly passionate exchanges are left unseen. </p> <p>Katya's nemesis is her mother-in-law, Kabanicha. Josephine Barstow was herself a renowned Katya in her day; her Kabanicha, a clipped, sour-faced old harridan, treads the line between being seriously unpleasant and comically so, staying just on the right side. Occasionally her look and tone hint at the bitter disappointments and regrets that have made the woman what she is. </p> <p>There were several other notable performances on stage: Marianna Tarasova as Varvara, Robert Dean Smith as Boris, Timothy Robinson as Kudrjas. Yet the production didn't quite achieve the opera's full sense of latent passion and violence. This was down to those in the orchestra pit. Janacek's music is economic in its expression, but it needs more light and shade, much more space than conductor Simone Young was prepared to yield.

Leeds dancer David Hughes is widely acknowledged as one of the most gifted contemporary dancers around, and his debut one-man show, MAP, is one to treasure, not least for his enthralling stage presence and enormous versatility. </p> <p>Hughes has worked with the major UK companies from London Contemporary to Rambert and Adventures in Motion Pictures; he is a highly focused dancer who performs with great passion and volcanic, yet controlled power. Christopher Bruce, artistic director of Rambert, Wayne McGregor, artistic director of Random, Robert Cohan, ex-London Contemporary Dance Theatre, and Siobhan Davies have all been inspired by his exceptional qualities and the works that they have made for him proclaim his gifts. </p> <p>MAP charts how Hughes's physical vocabulary has been shaped by the demands of different dance-makers and is also a personal rite of passage. The solos are such a box of goodies you are spoiled for choice, but Bruce's Hurricane, which he terms a pantomime, is a knockout. It's based on the story of American boxer Reuben \"Hurricane\" Carter, framed and jailed for 20 years for triple murder. The piece has Bruce stamped through it like a stick of rock and it suits Hughes well: fast and tricky, it packs a punch against injustice and is a great vehicle for the dancer's dramatic expression. </p> <p>Face painted white, Hughes takes on all the roles in Bob Dylan's drawling narration of the story that accompanies the piece. Hands bandaged, eyes innocently wide, he skips in a boxing ring of barred gold light, then switches from swaggering, brutish cops, to all-white jury, then trussed-up victim in commedia dell'arte style. The piece is athletic and punishing and timing is all as Hughes flings away his rope for the next bout of action. Like the jokey Vaudeville of Swan Song, his plea for human rights in South America, Bruce loves to expose wrongs with his own brand of irony. The vulnerable clown he has created for Hughes is another triumph and Hurricane had the audience calling for more. </p> <p>Every sinew of Hughes's body seems to have been choreographed in McGregor's strobe-fast solo, After Pneuma. The title refers, not to pneumatic muscles, but to the Greek for spirit. It also means genius. Set to haunting electronic blips, this is an exciting, demanding mix of freneticism and stillness, almost a parody of ballet class with slicing arms, angular moves, jerks and deliberately awkward gyrations. Robotic yet fluid, it is full of contrasts and Hughes stretches his body to the limit, as if McGregor has him on strings. </p> <p>In contrast, Cohan's Adagietto, danced to Mahler's Fifth Symphony, offers intensely moving images of personal struggle. Hughes sits on a chair with his back to us, sinuous arms outstretched. He raises them heavenwards, only to fall back in quiet desperation. The action shifts from staccato spins and rolls to moments of measured stealth. Vaslav Nijinsky is a hard act to follow, but the Davies version of L'Apr\u00e8s-Midi d'un Faun deploys Hughes's fluidity and control as he unfurls his body and luxuriates in the heat. MAP is a celebration of Hughes's talent and a tribute to him from those who recognise it. </p> <p>\u0095 At the New Electric Theatre, Barnsley College, tomorrow and Wednesday.
