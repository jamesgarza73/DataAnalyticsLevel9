He has filled his orchestral canvas with big, strongly characterised musical ideas and teeming filigree textures, organising the whole with harmonic sureness. </p> <p>There's no explicit programme for Fresco, but in the careful integration of the thematic material, and the ordered return of significant ideas, there is the whiff of a single-movement symphony. Perhaps it is five minutes too long but Lindberg is such a master of instrumental sonority that the fine print of his score is constantly absorbing. It would have been good to hear more of the inner lines than one did, but that was the hall's fault. </p> <p>The acoustics befuddled many of the mid-range textures in Oramo's account of The Planets too. This was the first time that Holst's suite had been performed in London with Colin Matthews's codicil, Pluto - the Renewer. </p> <p>Matthews has added another scherzo to the three in Holst's original scheme, and it is as different in character from them as they are from each other. Pluto moves very fast, and often very quietly, opening a wholly new and elusive musical dimension. Designed to grow seamlessly out of the ending of Holst's last movement, Neptune, the piece still manages to define its own musical space. While introducing new material, Matthews also refers back to the opening of the whole suite. If such a \"completion\" had to be done at all, it is hard to imagine that anyone could have done it better than him. </p> <p>On Friday another London premiere was the centrepiece of the BBC Philharmonic's second proms appearance of the week.

Perhaps it does in some respects, but there is no real sense that the latest work is any kind of convincing apotheosis. Although there are some marvellous, stirring passages, especially in the slow third movement, the problems of Davies's symphonic writing - the predictable manipulation of dramatic tension, the matt colouring of the orchestration, the lack of really strong melodic ideas - seem no nearer to solution now than they were a quarter of a century ago.</p>",

Probably the moment you give an order that someone else takes exception to. Getting your own way doesn't necessarily come any easier when you have the word manager in your job title. Leaders can only lead when others agree to be led. </p> <p> Even if you are not a manager by title your job will still include management skills. The five-way manager manages upward, sideways, downwards and outwards. This means that you manage your boss and those above you; your colleagues and other members of your team; the people you delegate work to; and external clients and suppliers. Oh, and you also manage yourself, which can be the hardest job of all. Below we explain how not to behave if you want to get things done, and offer tips on the gentle art of workplace persuasion.</p> <p><strong>1. The spoilt brat</strong></p> <p>If sulking were an Olympic sport you'd win the gold. In your quest to bend others to your will, you leave no stone unturned in terms of childish and brattish behaviour. You are moody, temperamental and the queen of the flounce. It was a dark day when they invented the open-plan office because it meant there were no doors left for you to slam in your wake. Your bottom lip is jutted so often you've begun to resemble a bulldog taking part in a gurning contest.</p> <p><strong>2. The wobbly-thrower</strong></p> <p>It's easy to spot the symptoms when someone says no to you. Your face reddens and your eyes bulge. All the devil-may-care sophistication strips away like nose-skin after sunburn and you start to lose it, big-time. Threats and ultimatums are your house style, although muttered revenge is another popular option and one you will share with all your long-suffering colleagues. They will hear your shriek of disbelief three floors down in IT and everyone will make a mental note to keep clear of the loos for the rest of the day because it is there that you will set up camp to regale anyone unfortunate enough to pop in for a pee with the details of your most recent slight.</p> <p><strong>3. The manipulator</strong></p> <p>You study people for a living and know just which strings to pull to get your own way. You are a stranger to the word dignity and will stoop lower than a turtle's undercarriage to get what you want. One of your most nauseating displays is the girlie routine that you employ regularly on both male and female colleagues alike. This involves hand-clutching body language, and a voice that would make a five-year-old blush with shame. \"Would oo like to do this likkle job for moi?\" is the sort of verbal treacle that trickles out of your mouth. People do what you want just to avoid an attack of projectile vomiting.</p> <p><strong>4. The martyr</strong></p> <p>You will never ever ask for what you want at work. In fact, if and when it is offered you will usually turn it down. And then you will play the martyr, falling silent for days, with your face twisted into a mask of suffering that would turn a saint green with envy. You think delegation is for wimps, and your favourite phrase is: \"If you want anything done around here you have to do it yourself.\" What you are hoping for is that all your colleagues will feel so guilty at the sight of your suffering that they will bend so far backward that you will be able to snap them in two. </p> <p><strong>5. The bossy-boots</strong></p> <p>Never persuade when a simple command will suffice is your motto. And if that command is relayed via a shout, so much the better. You are an aggressive bully who uses spoken or implied threats to get your own way. You are so task-focused you see no need to consider who you tread on to get the job done. It's a matter of ends, not means with you.

It pitched nine inches outside the off stump, turned down the slope sufficiently to penetrate the gap between bat and pad and to clip the off bail. Illy would probably have been proud of that one; Gough certainly was. Mullally soon accounted for Campbell, prodding limply to cover, while Johnson threatened with several trademark square drives. But in attempting another, he was bowled off the inside edge by Caddick.</p> <p>So the Flowers had to dig in and England allowed them no liberties.

It is amazing to think that his place was in jeopardy last autumn or that he was omitted from the one-day squad in Southern Africa last winter.</p> <p>The likeliest lads to replace him, Paul Nixon and Rob Turner, are fading. Chris Read flickered but there are still doubts about the quality of his keeping (I remember wandering around Old Trafford last year with Bob Taylor, who was aghast at Read's foot movements when standing up to the spinners). </p> <p>There was a time when the English viewed their wicketkeepers like their goalkeepers, making the happy assumption that they were the best in the world. That no longer applies in football or cricket. There are still some doughty keepers on the circuit, who are not much younger than Stewart, like Adrian Aymes and Karl Krikken. Keith Piper has good hands, but is reckoned to be inconsistent and a modest run scorer. I've heard good reports of James Foster from Essex, another Durham student, but he's yet to play a first class game. The conclusion is that Stewart, if he stays fit (not to be taken for granted) and hungry (never much doubt about that) could keep the job until he's 40. </p> <p>Moreover the requirements of the modern wicketkeeper have changed. Now he must be able to bat; in the past this was merely a bonus; it was possible for ordinary batsmen like Bob Taylor or Keith Andrew to justify a place in the England team simply because of their keeping. No longer. This change of emphasis now applies to almost every kind of cricketer. Only a paceman or a wrist-spinner (if there are any good ones) can anticipate an international cap despite being unable to contribute with the bat. The age of the specialist is fast disappearing. </p> <p>This is especially true of finger spinners. For example, the English selectors will be mulling over which spinner to take to Old Trafford for the next Test, which starts on 3 August. In Manchester the wicket usually demands at least one slow bowler in the side. Arguably the best available finger spinners are still Peter Such and Phil Tufnell, but neither will be summoned away from county cricket next week. (In fact Such has only just won his place back in the Essex side.) For they offer nothing but their bowling. </p> <p>So the choice for the Old Trafford Test will be between Robert Croft, who can bat a bit and bowl a length, or possibly Warwickshire's Ashley Giles, a better batsman than Croft but an unproven spinner at the highest level. Likewise look at the two Northamptonshire off-spinners. Jason Brown is clearly a better bowler than Graeme Swann, but it was the multi-purpose Swann who made England's winter tour party. </p> <p>Selectors and coaches everywhere now crave dual purpose cricketers. Yet true all-rounders seem to be becoming a rarer commodity (we were spoilt in the decades of Ian Botham, Imran Khan and Kapil Dev). So the brightest sparks to join the England side - Michael Vaughan and Marcus Trescothick - not only bat but can toss down a few useful overs of off-spin and medium pace respectively. We are in a mix-and-match era. </p> <p>Only the exceptional cricketer can now afford to neglect any aspect of their game. This is a pragmatic rather than romantic advance. There was a bizarre delight in watching Devon Malcolm or Tufnell bat or David Gower bowl. I hope this trend does not mean that the truly gifted 'one-dimensional' cricketer is not scorned immediately - because he's slow in the field and incapable of bowling or batting. But any intelligent youngster must now devote himself to every discipline of the game. </p> <p>However, in the past fortnight I've noticed one modern trend being reversed. Prior to last year's World Cup there was much talk about England's one-day 'specialists' being drafted into the squad - the likes of Vince Wells, Ian Austin and Adam Hollioake. I didn't like the idea much then and it appears the selectors have had second thoughts now. Apart from Mark Ealham, who is a very worthwhile member of the one-day team, all the members of the side playing against Zimbabwe yesterday are in the selectors' minds for Old Trafford. The disparity between the Test team and the one-day team has been greatly reduced and that is a good sign. For it reassures us that quality counts.</p>",

So the brightest sparks to join the England side - Michael Vaughan and Marcus Trescothick - not only bat but can toss down a few useful overs of off-spin and medium pace respectively. We are in a mix-and-match era. Only the exceptional cricketer can now afford to neglect any aspect of their game. This is a pragmatic rather than romantic advance. There was a bizarre delight in watching Devon Malcolm or Tufnell bat or David Gower bowl. I hope this trend does not mean that the truly gifted 'one-dimensional' cricketer is not scorned immediately - because he's slow in the field and incapable of bowling or batting. But any intelligent youngster must now devote himself to every discipline of the game. However, in the past fortnight I've noticed one modern trend being reversed. Prior to last year's World Cup there was much talk about England's one-day 'specialists' being drafted into the squad - the likes of Vince Wells, Ian Austin and Adam Hollioake. I didn't like the idea much then and it appears the selectors have had second thoughts now. Apart from Mark Ealham, who is a very worthwhile member of the one-day team, all the members of the side playing against Zimbabwe yesterday are in the selectors' minds for Old Trafford. The disparity between the Test team and the one-day team has been greatly reduced and that is a good sign. For it reassures us that quality counts.",

      "body": "<p>When one of the world's richest men - and certainly one of its most generous - invites you to be his guest, it's not an offer you want to turn down. When he's inviting you to his own cricketing Shangri-la, it's irresistible. </p> <p>So it was last Sunday that I made for Wormsley Park, the magnificent 2,500-acre Oxfordshire estate of Sir Paul Getty, alias John Paul Getty II, the American-turned-Briton and son of the late oil billionaire. He was hosting the match between his own select XI and the MCC. This was definitely a red-ringed date in my diary. </p> <p>Cricket in the Chilterns? Oh yes. This Getty venue is already becoming the stuff of legend, secluded behind the kind of security one would expect at such a family's private retreat. He has created a superb oval ground, carved partly out of a hillside, and it is only a few years since I was privileged to run up the Wormsley Park flag above the splendid thatched pavilion for the first time. You see Sir Paul (the address is formal now following his 1986 KBE and subsequent 1998 metamorphosis from American citizen to British subject) is a complete cricket nut. </p> <p>Strange, perhaps, to think of a man whose wealth was estimated at \u00a31.3 billion in the mid-Nineties to be so taken with this most English of games. But taken he is. Very taken indeed. </p> <p>I can't honestly remember the first time I met Sir Paul but I knew of his fascination with the game long before he asked me to raise his standard above the pavilion for the first time when the ground opened. Yet his introduction to the game was somewhat bizarre. </p> <p>It goes back, so he tells it, some years when he owned a villa on the Caribbean island of Mustique and Rolling Stone Mick Jagger was one of his near neighbours. Jagger's love of cricket is well known and he would have the videos of England's Test matches flown in to the island long before satellites made such steam-engine technology obsolete. At the time, Getty was suffering from a serious bout of insomnia, so Jagger suggested he might get some satisfaction, so to speak, by spending the wee small hours watching some top class cricket. </p> <p>Once hooked, it was inevitable that Sir Paul would make a big impact. This, remember, is the man who has seen fit to give away some \u00a3140 million of his fortune, according to some shrewd observers. He tells the story of a request from an African who wrote complaining that he was always sacked from jobs because he suffered from sleeping sickness. He asked Getty for \u00a31m, and it may not be apocryphal that a cheque was duly despatched. </p> <p>Causes closer to his adopted home have benefited greatly. New works for the National Gallery? \u00a330m? No problem, in fact let's make it \u00a350m. The British Film Institute? Here's \u00a320m. Cricket was not forgotten. Before concentrating on his own oval, the new Mound Stand at Lord's was underpinned by \u00a32m worth of Getty largesse. </p> <p>Last Sunday's slice of generous hospitality began with drinks for guests on arrival late morning: Pimms, Buck's fizz or Champagne. Sir Paul emerged later to greet players and guests. He is a lovely man and I was saddened to see him watching the action in a wheelchair. I knew he had been poorly recently but his determination to be a lively host remains undimmed and he joined my wife, Veronica, and I for a chat. There was only one subject: cricket. </p> <p>There could be nothing else on the agenda when other great companions were around this charming ground, with its thatched scoreboard complementing the pavilion, its majestic playing area meticulously prepared and picturesque marquees for the guests. </p> <p>There was Keith Miller, my old Aussie sparring partner and great mate. He was a sporting god in his pomp and he lived hard and played hard - harder than he like to let on in the middle. He was a terrific bowler, as fast as anyone when he let his quick one go, and a very dangerous batsman. He could turn a game with bat or ball in just a few overs. </p> <p>Our paths first crossed in 1953 - the final Test at The Oval when England won back the Ashes - but I always remind him of the Lord's Test in the 1956 series when I got him out in both innings. For his part, he reminded me (again) of his 260-odd for the Aussies against the Combined Services when I was in the RAF. I remember it too. I marked out my run-up at the start of the innings only to be told by some Colonel Blimp that I'd not been told I was bowling. I rather lost interest after that and at one point I sat on the sightscreen. The colonel reprimanded me at the end of the game and said I'd never play for Combined Services again. 'Too right,' I replied. 'I'm getting my discharge papers tomorrow.' </p> <p>Keith was a giant of a player, so I'd been concerned to hear that he was using a frame to help him walk - even if he is an old man of 80 now. I need not have worried as he was walking well, aided only by a stick. Age does creep up on us all, however, and I felt mine when chatting to another guest, Sir Richard Hadlee. I recalled that I'd played for Yorkshire against his father, Walter, who skippered the 1949 Kiwis. Richard's nickname is 'Paddles' because of his huge feet. </p> <p>There was Ted Dexter, a great mate, and his wife Suzie; Colin Ingleby-Mackenzie stopped to chat - he never changes, a big loveable, affable bear of a man. Like Keith and myself, he probably finds some aspects of today's game a little foreign_ even our host, Sir Paul, is in that club. </p> <p>Miller, for one, does not understand this era of helmets and arm and chest protectors, not to mention \u00a3500,000-a-year cricketers. But on this Sunday afternoon at Wormsley Park, all that is forgotten. For Sir Paul lets it be known that the England - and the game - he fell in love with is not necessarily the 21st century version. </p> <p>This ground, he tells me, is a joy to him. It reeks of old England. To me, it is like a Tardis, transporting me back to the days of playing in front of stately homes or in some noble lord's grounds. I'm taken back to playing on Lord Scarborough's estate. It's not just the face of old pal Brian Johnson wrought into the weather vane atop the pavilion; not just the Pimms. It's the people, the old friends, the striped blazers and dazzling, colourful summer dresses. It is Old England, brought to us on a plate by a 67-year-old child of San Francisco. </p> <p>No wonder Getty says: 'It's probably true that the Britain I love is not the Britain which exists today. But it is still closer to that than anything else.' </p> <p>It's a reflection that suggests his contentment with his British way of life after years of well-chronicled mid-life excess. He spent years in Italy after leaving his father's business and, if rum was his favourite tipple, then many other temptations eventually prompted him to seek sanctuary and cleansing in the London Clinic. Stability with his third wife, Victoria, has reached a new, high plane on the Wormsley estate. </p> <p>His generosity also peels back layers of apparent contradictions. He has confessed to being a great admirer of Margaret Thatcher and enjoyed the company of fellow cricket lover John Major, yet he was quick to write a cheque for \u00a3100,000 to support the striking miners during their 1984 conflict with the Thatcher government. </p> <p>He bridles at suggestions that it takes big Getty bucks to bring cricketing greats to play at his paradise in the Chilterns. Pay them? Not at all. Their reward is a good lunch (beef wellington), a hot shower and a clean towel. </p> <p>And then it's over. Sir Paul's side wins by three wickets, boosted by a Graham Gooch century. My wife and I head back for the Yorkshire Dales and, as I'm driving, I've ignored the Pimms and bubbly. As for Sir Paul, it's clear that he enjoys the company of cricketers. He had the 1997 Australians here - he was overheard describing that as 'the greatest day of my life' - hosted the Sri Lankans last year and the West Indians will be coming to play soon. He genuinely likes the men who play this game - and how the game is played: 'It is so much more than a game_ It's the surroundings as well. I love it all. I think that's what sets cricket apart. There is a whole way of life about it which I adore. And I like cricketers. Not because they all have names with four initials - they come from all walks of life and then tend to be wonderful people.' </p> <p>I drink to that when I can - when I'm out of my car and back in Yorkshire later that night with a bag of fish and chips, washed down by a glass of wine at last. I'd been to a different world - but a wonderful one.</p>",

Next to a busy bar he fell unseen into the swimming pool and drowned. </p> <p>This summer 5,000 Thomson holidaymakers will arrive in Lanzarote every week. While the majority will enjoy a trouble-free holiday, sometimes things do go badly wrong. </p> <p>I always thought of holiday reps as people with ready smiles keen to sell excursions at ubiquitous 'welcome meetings'. But my day spent with Nicola Stone, guest service manager for Thomson Holidays, gave an insight into the behind-the-scenes world of the rep. </p> <p>The boy's distraught mother and grandmother needed a doctor for sedation, the holidaymaker who had dived into the swimming pool in a vain rescue attempt was distressed and wanted to be flown home, while the hotel owner was inconsolable. Only the previous week a 45-year-old British man had died at his hotel of a heart attack. </p> <p>Extra staff were drafted in from neighbouring resorts to help counsel guests who were in shock. Throughout the day teddy bear tributes appeared at the poolside. </p> <p>Nicola's colleague Tracy did not leave the bereaved family's side. She organised visits to the Chapel of Rest and got hold of the family priest. She also had to persuade the family that the best thing to do was to go home. After hours of gentle persuasion they agreed. </p> <p>This summer Thomson has launched a new concept for its in-resort service - troubleshooters who focus on trying to sort out a customer's problem in resort. The idea was trialled in Majorca and Lanzarote last year before it was rolled out to all of Thomson's main summer sun resorts with the more sedate name of guest service manager. They have a dual role - to handle customer complaints and oversee the quality aspects in resort. They also have the power to hand out compensation on the spot. From this summer any rep who fails to sort out a client's problem will call in a guest service manager who guarantees to be there within the hour. 'Sometimes I feel like Anneka Rice,' said Nicola. </p> <p>She is often telephoned in the middle of the night after couples have rowed. 'Domestics are awful - particularly when alcohol or drugs are involved.' Recently Nicola was called out at 2am after a woman complained that her boyfriend had hit her. She wanted to press charges. 'As a female it can be difficult as you have to walk in and calm things down. Sometimes people throw up all over you.' But the next day when Nicola went to follow up the incident it had all changed. 'The girl was holding hands with her boyfriend and they were madly in love again. I asked her if she wanted to do a report but she didn't want to know.' Such happy reconciliations may be gratifying but hard to bear when you have been woken in the middle of the night to resolve them. </p> <p>The night before I arrived a couple had been mugged and a Thomson rep had to organise an interpreter to go to the police station with them and report the incident. Another family had complained that the hotel security guard had manhandled their son. It was up to Nicola and her colleagues to sort it out. </p> <p>Many guests have become professional complainers. Nicola said: 'This one man had only been on the island an hour when he said he was worried his son might stand on the patio furniture on his first-floor balcony room and fall off.' He said that last year another tour operator had given him \u00a350, a hire car and free trip after he had complained. Nicola upgraded the man and his family to a four- star property at no extra charge but he was still not happy. </p> <p>'He rang the Holiday Helpline and insisted that he would take it further but it did not warrant any compensation. He was in a hotel that cost \u00a3400 more than he had paid and I had even stumped up for his taxi fare to inspect it before he moved.' </p> <p>Nicola says clients are now much more aware of their rights. They often bring a copy of the brochure on holiday with them and when they want to complain they ask for the Holiday Report Form by name. </p> <p>In stark contrast, some clients who are unhappy with their holiday fail to tell the reps. The first thing Thomson knows about it is when it receives a letter on the client's return to the UK. 'Some of the letters are very petty but it is a shame because we weren't even given a chance to help them.' </p> <p>Large groups of people getting together to complain are becoming increasingly common. 'It is like a kangaroo court. We had one group who were unhappy about work being carried out on the swimming pool and called a meeting with us. It can be quite intimidating if you have got 100 people shouting at you.' </p> <p>In this case their unhappiness was justified. A large section of the pool was being renovated. Thomson ended up paying \u00a316,000 in compensation, which it aimed to get back from the hotelier who had broken his contract by carrying out the work. </p> <p>A big part of Nicola's job is focused on quality. She has to check that work has been carried out on swimming pools and that other promised facilities are due to open on time. If they are not she has to make sure clients are informed before they travel. </p> <p>Clients can often cause embarrassment to Thomson staff when they steal things from their rooms. One apartment owner complained that all the toasters and kettles were being taken and there were footprints over his newly decorated walls. Another client had lost his room key and broken down the door instead of asking reception for another key. Nicola had to liaise between the client and an angry hotelier demanding that he pay for half the damage. </p> <p>Nicola, 32, has been working in the resort for seven years and still enjoys the job. Her mobile phone rings constantly, even on her one day off. But the burn-out rate for many holiday reps is high. Long hours and sometimes difficult clients can take their toll. </p> <p>'What you have to remind yourself is that many of our clients have saved up all year to have a holiday in the sun,' said Nicola. Like the thousands of British reps working in resorts she will try to help any holidaymaker who has a problem. Sadly there are some things a holiday rep can't put right.</p> <p><strong>How to complain </strong></p> <p>Under the 1992 Package Travel Regulations, tour operators are responsible for the hotel, transfers and airline contracted as part of the package. For example, if the brochure says the hotel features a gym but it is closed when you arrive you may be entitled to compensation. </p> <p>If you do have a problem with an aspect of your package you should contact the tour operator's rep in the resort.

Not a good start for the centrepiece of the millennial Bastille Day, the 'Incroyable pique-nique' - a nation-long linear banquet stretching, with a few gaps, 1,000 kilometres from Dunkirk in the North to Prats-de-Mollo, on the Spanish border, in the South. It is designed to celebrate and inaugurate the 'Meridianne Verte' - a mighty row of trees planted this year through the centre of the country along the Paris meridian in a living tribute to the millennium. </p> <p>One of the areas hardest hit by the weather is the Cantal, a rural d\u00e9partement of rounded hills and unspoilt villages at the southern end of the Auvergne. In the village of Mourjou (pop. 354), one of 337 communes along the line of the great picnic, the day begins with a flurry of phone calls. Is it going ahead or not? Two villages have cried off entirely. Who's still on? In the end Genevi\u00e8ve won't come to the picnic, V\u00e9ronique and Michel will, and Peter (slightly grudgingly) and Richard. But we opt out of the walk which was planned to work up people's appetites. Only 30 or so brave hikers start out from the tricolour-bedecked mairie on the 10km trek to lunch. </p> <p>For us, the initial omens are not good. After a 20-minute drive through the drizzly countryside, we arrive at a sodden hillside field, the original destination, to be redirected to a more sheltered spot in nearby Cassaniouze. </p> <p>Rain drips from the trees and the sky is heavy as a plate of cold aligot. But inside the shelter, set with tables spread with rolls of a 600km length of red-and-white checked tablecloth, specially made for the occasion, the mood is quite different. The atmosphere is one of shared defiance and good humour, laced with the unmistakable sense of a deserved enjoyment of the rewards of shared fortitude - very much like an English picnic, in fact. </p> <p>As the meal progresses, the separate groups of diners noisily coalesce. An accordionist with a weather-sculpted face looms out of the damp to play vigorous Auvergnat tunes. A Cassaniouze stalwart passes round a bottle of home-made prune wine, completing the integration process. The tablecloth is ceremonially cut up into souvenir-sized pieces. It's the longest single piece of cloth ever made by the manufacturing firm. </p> <p>Back in Mourjou, after a well lubricated evening meal for 100 or so at the mairie, most of the village packs the hall to listen to a storyteller, une conteuse , who for an hour and a half holds young and old with a graphic telling of local legends and myths. In a mixture of French and Occitan (the language of Proven\u00e7ale), it's a remarkable performance. The biggest laugh of the evening: when she weaves into one of her tales a derogatory mention of McDonald's. </p> <p>After all, this is close to Millau, where the court case against the French farmers' leader Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9, for having 'dismantled' a new McDonald's outlet in 1998, led to a proto- pique-nique - a celebration of localness, diversity and the right to oppose everything the Great Hamburger is seen to stand for. </p> <p>Whether in rainswept Cassaniouze, in Paris, or in the tiny village of Mosset where my godson Theo lives with his parents Rosemary and Miles, the pique-niqueurs play out the Revolutionary theme. Passing through 20 d\u00e9partements, the Meridianne on which they sit (or shelter) is itself a symbol of unity and difference, a living link from the flat fields of the Pas de Calais to the mountainous Pyrenees, by way of Paris in the middle. Local and national at the same time, the 'Incroyable pique-nique' is democratic fraternity in action. </p> <p>The walkers in search of their lunch are also following a revolutionary route. For the Meridianne traces the path chosen by the revolutionary authorities in 1792 as the line along which to measure the exact distance from the North Pole to the Equator. </p> <p>One ten-millionth of that length was to be the metre, the keystone of a new measurement system that (far from being the artificial imposition sometimes represented in Britain) would free the poor for ever from ' deux poids deux mesures ' - arbitrary changes to weights, measures and currency with which the ruling class had long oppressed them. The French wanted the Paris meridian, not Greenwich, to be the baseline for calculations of world time and longitude. Paris Mean Time wasn't to be, but the metric system commemorated in the Meridenne Verte remains one of the most liberating, egalitarian achievements of the Revolution. </p> <p>So it may not have been a beautiful day on 14 July in a meteorological sense.

Celtic history, Arthurian legend, Cumbrian crafts and Lake District alumnus William Wordsworth have been brought together in a \u00a315 million seven-acre development Rheged (also known as the Upland Kingdom Discovery Centre). </p> <p>Housed inside Britain's largest grass-covered building, Rheged (named after an ancient Celtic kingdom) aims to give visitors an insight into 2,000 years of history, from the mysteries of stone circles and Arthurian legend to Wordsworth and the present day. The centrepiece is the first all-British large format film, Rheged: the Lost King dom , while the Made in Cumbria exhibition markets traditional products from more than 400 local organisations, including ceramics from Alston, hand-forged ironwork from Ravenstonedale and turned wood from Sedbergh. </p> <p>Although Rheged has just opened to the public, an official opening by Melvyn Bragg, who is from Cumbria, is scheduled for 4 August. The attraction is close to junction 40 on the M6 near Penrith.

Not only is there a new range of Bagpuss soft toys - press the inside of his mouth and listen to his famous yawn! - but he has also been modified into a backpack. Prices range from \u00a35.99 for the beanies to \u00a319.99 for the backpack. </p> <p>It wasn't only man who landed on the moon in 1969: the Clangers made it into space too. They have also been accorded the honour of their own soft toy range: squeeze them to hear that special Clanger whistle. (Clanger toys, \u00a35.99)</p> <p>The toys make perfect rewards for good behaviour, but the proportion sold to nostalgia-hungry twentysomethings will remain open for debate.

      "bodyText": "Legends lurk in the Lakes Something is stirring in the Lake District this summer. Celtic history, Arthurian legend, Cumbrian crafts and Lake District alumnus William Wordsworth have been brought together in a \u00a315 million seven-acre development Rheged (also known as the Upland Kingdom Discovery Centre). Housed inside Britain's largest grass-covered building, Rheged (named after an ancient Celtic kingdom) aims to give visitors an insight into 2,000 years of history, from the mysteries of stone circles and Arthurian legend to Wordsworth and the present day. The centrepiece is the first all-British large format film, Rheged: the Lost King dom , while the Made in Cumbria exhibition markets traditional products from more than 400 local organisations, including ceramics from Alston, hand-forged ironwork from Ravenstonedale and turned wood from Sedbergh. Although Rheged has just opened to the public, an official opening by Melvyn Bragg, who is from Cumbria, is scheduled for 4 August. The attraction is close to junction 40 on the M6 near Penrith. Tel: 01768 868000 or try www.rheged.com (tickets: adults \u00a34.95, children \u00a33.50, family \u00a314.50) \u0095Cumbria has just become the world's first Green Globe destination - meeting sustainable tourist targets set at the Rio Earth Summit. Bagpuss is back! Bagpuss, the saggy old cloth cat recently voted top BBC children's character of all time, is back. Not only is there a new range of Bagpuss soft toys - press the inside of his mouth and listen to his famous yawn! - but he has also been modified into a backpack. Prices range from \u00a35.99 for the beanies to \u00a319.99 for the backpack. It wasn't only man who landed on the moon in 1969: the Clangers made it into space too. They have also been accorded the honour of their own soft toy range: squeeze them to hear that special Clanger whistle. (Clanger toys, \u00a35.99) The toys make perfect rewards for good behaviour, but the proportion sold to nostalgia-hungry twentysomethings will remain open for debate.

      "body": "<p>Back in 1972 when he was one of the hottest directors in Hollywood, William Friedkin had what he referred to, with typically grandiose style, as 'an epiphany'. One of his heroes, director Howard Hawkes, questioned his earlier adaptation of Mart Crowley's gay-themed play The Boys In The Band because 'people don't want any of that psychological shit. Every time I make a film with a lotta good guys against bad guys it had a lotta success.' </p> <p>The sentiment hit home. Friedkin was converted. 'What we were doing wasn't making fucking films to hang in the Louvre,' the born-again Friedkin later explained. 'We were making films to entertain people and if they didn't do that first then they didn't fulfil their primary purpose.' He immediately abandoned the slightly esoteric movies he'd been concerning himself with (previous notable efforts had included a celluloid adaptation of Pinter's The Birthday Party ) and, while the New Wave of American directors continued to look towards Truffaut and Goddard, he committed to directing the hard-boiled corrupt cop story The French Connection. It garnered him his first Oscar. </p> <p>Next he spotted the potential in horror pot boiler The Exorcist , a project that had been dropped by directors as diverse as Mike Nichols, John Boorman and Bonnie And Clyde' s Arthur Penn as impossible to adapt both because of its intense imagery - a pre-pubescent girl masturbating with a crucifix while spewing vomit and obscenities was daring even to the New Hollywood - but because the film hinged on a credible performance by a teenager. He promptly gained a nomination for a second golden statue. He seemed destined to become one of America's leading blockbuster directors combining an avowed populism with an eye for edgy, exploitative material. </p> <p>And then, nothing. It would be almost 25 years before he had his next commercial hit. It opens in cinemas next month. Friedkin pulls his coat up around himself against the unseasonably chilly breeze in the back of a poolside cabana at the Hotel Du Cap in Antibes. We are 20 miles away from the chaos of the Cannes Film Festival and, though Friedkin, 61, will not be attending the festivities, he is celebrating. His latest film, Rules Of Engagement, has topped the US box office for a fortnight and got the kind of controversial reception he has sought since The French Connection . </p> <p>The film follows a US Marine (Samuel L. Jackson), who massacres 80 people in an embassy siege in Yemen, is defended by a past-his-sell-by-date military lawyer (Tommy Lee Jones), delivers a heady dose of barely disguised American triumphalism and has had mixed reviews ('It has something to offend every political sensibility,' remarked Time magazine), led to the odd Arab protest and, apparently, delighted the punters. </p> <p>'There are reports of audiences standing at the end of the movie and cheering,' he smiles. 'Make of that what you will. I expect a little controversy. It's not unusual. I don't enjoy it. But the subjects that interest me attract that. Often, at the time, I don't understand why there were protests.' He argues that the scene that leads to the whooping and hollering - the verdict - is in fact ambiguous and open to misinterpretation by audiences. But it's not beyond the realm of possibility that it was precisely the potentially incendiary subject matter that drew Friedkin to the project, which had languished in development hell for a full decade before it was sent to him. </p> <p>In the past he has not been above whipping up his own brouhaha when the public has not obliged. During the making of The Exorcist he was the main, though covert, source of the 'cursed set' rumour as well as the bizarre assertion that the famous levitation sequences were achieved with 'magnetic fields' rather than the more prosaic 'piano wire'. What is not in doubt is that to have any movie making its money back at the box office must be a massive relief. </p> <p>What is most surprising about Friedkin is that, unlike the other Seventies directors whose careers stalled at the end of that decade, he above them all should have been a success in the Eighties and Nineties. Unlike Francis Ford Coppola, Robert Altman, Peter Bogdanovich and most of the rest of the New Wave, he was acutely aware of commercial potential and the importance of immediately engaging an audience. </p> <p>His background had been in live television ('I'd directed over 2,000 live shows before I even looked through a film camera viewfinder,' he says) and employed the disciplines of dramatic immediacy and intimacy in both The Exorcist and The French Connection. </p> <p>His sensationalist style could certainly have found a home. Dutch director Paul Verhoeven (Basic Instinct, Total Recall), whose in-your-face showmanship and crass populism most closely resemble Friedkin's, made the decade his own. What Friedkin had lost was the ability to spot unique material that had served him so well in the Seventies and so his career fell off a cliff. </p> <p>'I never set out to make a bad film,' he says. 'I thought in each case they were going to be as good or better than anything I had done. I went through this long period of wondering why I wasn't being received in the same way. Now I've reached the point where I know why. These films just weren't any fucking good.' Immediately after The Exorcist came Sorcerer, an ill-fated attempt to remake The Wages of Fear, which foundered critically and at the box office. (Friedkin, who had begged Wages director Henri-George Clouzot for permission to remake his classic, asked his assistant what he had said to the director when he gave his assent. 'You said you promised you'd not make it better than he did,' the assistant recalled. 'I was right,' Friedkin grimly confirmed.) </p> <p>The plummet continued with Cruising, a garish murder mystery set against the gay S&amp;M scene. Predictably, American homosexuals were less than delighted with the director's attentions. Neither was the American ratings board, which demanded that Friedkin make cuts. </p> <p>'But at the time we made Cruising, around 1980, that aspect of gay life had not been portrayed in a mainstream film in the United States,' he says. 'I could certainly understand them not wanting to feel that this was representative of all gay life. But most of the journals that condemned the film originally have reversed their opinion.' </p> <p>Given that many of the criticisms of the film were precisely on the subject of accuracy (among other alarming gaffes the movie had star Al Pacino applying mascara before visiting an S&amp;M club), this is, at best, doubtful. But the decline continued relentlessly. TV work for cheap horror anthologies such as The Twilight Zone and Tales From The Crypt was followed by the at best average thriller To Live And Die In LA before his career hit its nadir in the shape of lamentable 'haunted tree' movie The Guardian. 'I was misguided,' he sighs. 'I came to the view, shortly after making it, that it was rubbish. I had a bum-steer. The attempt was to make a sort of fairytale - the brothers Grimm set in modern times. Even at early audience previews it seemed to be working.' </p> <p>In fact many critics found it difficult to decide whether it was the tree or Jenny Seagrove who delivered the most plank-like performance. After the equally appalling thriller Jade he was reduced to a made-for-cable remake of Sidney Lumet classic 12 Angry Men, which boasted an eclectic cast including Jack Lemmon and Who's The Boss star and one-time TV pin-up Tony Danza. And then Rules Of Engagement arrived. </p> <p>'I think most Americans regard the government as either corrupt or inept,' he says when asked what in the movie had struck a cord with US audiences. 'And most of the military believe that about the bureaucracy that controls them. The film is really an examination of the actions of this man. Was what he did an act of extreme courage? To me that is an open question in the film. The verdict given is not necessarily the verdict that I find satisfactory.' </p> <p>Hmmm. Friedkin and ambiguity. Frankly you're reminded of Mel Brooks's comment regarding subtlety. 'Subtlety? I got subtlety blowin' outta my ass!' In his darker moments it appears that Friedkin is well aware of unfulfilled potential.'The thing that drove me and keeps me going is Citizen Kane . I hope to one day make a film to rank with that. I haven't yet,' he told Peter Biskind, author of the seminal Seventies chronicle Easy Riders Raging Bulls. </p> <p>Whatever the merits of Rules Of Engagement, it has put Friedkin back on the map. Whereas he used to wait years for a project only last week he used the platform of the Moscow Film Festival to announce his next - a biopic of boxer Sonny Liston with Ving Rhames in the lead role. But given Friedkin's continuing form, Orson Welles can rest easy. </p> <p>\u0095 Rules of Engagement opens 11 August</p>",

Jackson), who massacres 80 people in an embassy siege in Yemen, is defended by a past-his-sell-by-date military lawyer (Tommy Lee Jones), delivers a heady dose of barely disguised American triumphalism and has had mixed reviews ('It has something to offend every political sensibility,' remarked Time magazine), led to the odd Arab protest and, apparently, delighted the punters. 'There are reports of audiences standing at the end of the movie and cheering,' he smiles. 'Make of that what you will. I expect a little controversy. It's not unusual. I don't enjoy it. But the subjects that interest me attract that. Often, at the time, I don't understand why there were protests.' He argues that the scene that leads to the whooping and hollering - the verdict - is in fact ambiguous and open to misinterpretation by audiences. But it's not beyond the realm of possibility that it was precisely the potentially incendiary subject matter that drew Friedkin to the project, which had languished in development hell for a full decade before it was sent to him. In the past he has not been above whipping up his own brouhaha when the public has not obliged. During the making of The Exorcist he was the main, though covert, source of the 'cursed set' rumour as well as the bizarre assertion that the famous levitation sequences were achieved with 'magnetic fields' rather than the more prosaic 'piano wire'. What is not in doubt is that to have any movie making its money back at the box office must be a massive relief. What is most surprising about Friedkin is that, unlike the other Seventies directors whose careers stalled at the end of that decade, he above them all should have been a success in the Eighties and Nineties. Unlike Francis Ford Coppola, Robert Altman, Peter Bogdanovich and most of the rest of the New Wave, he was acutely aware of commercial potential and the importance of immediately engaging an audience. His background had been in live television ('I'd directed over 2,000 live shows before I even looked through a film camera viewfinder,' he says) and employed the disciplines of dramatic immediacy and intimacy in both The Exorcist and The French Connection. His sensationalist style could certainly have found a home. Dutch director Paul Verhoeven (Basic Instinct, Total Recall), whose in-your-face showmanship and crass populism most closely resemble Friedkin's, made the decade his own. What Friedkin had lost was the ability to spot unique material that had served him so well in the Seventies and so his career fell off a cliff. 'I never set out to make a bad film,' he says. 'I thought in each case they were going to be as good or better than anything I had done. I went through this long period of wondering why I wasn't being received in the same way. Now I've reached the point where I know why. These films just weren't any fucking good.' Immediately after The Exorcist came Sorcerer, an ill-fated attempt to remake The Wages of Fear, which foundered critically and at the box office. (Friedkin, who had begged Wages director Henri-George Clouzot for permission to remake his classic, asked his assistant what he had said to the director when he gave his assent. 'You said you promised you'd not make it better than he did,' the assistant recalled. 'I was right,' Friedkin grimly confirmed.) The plummet continued with Cruising, a garish murder mystery set against the gay S&amp;M scene. Predictably, American homosexuals were less than delighted with the director's attentions. Neither was the American ratings board, which demanded that Friedkin make cuts. 'But at the time we made Cruising, around 1980, that aspect of gay life had not been portrayed in a mainstream film in the United States,' he says. 'I could certainly understand them not wanting to feel that this was representative of all gay life. But most of the journals that condemned the film originally have reversed their opinion.' Given that many of the criticisms of the film were precisely on the subject of accuracy (among other alarming gaffes the movie had star Al Pacino applying mascara before visiting an S&amp;M club), this is, at best, doubtful. But the decline continued relentlessly. TV work for cheap horror anthologies such as The Twilight Zone and Tales From The Crypt was followed by the at best average thriller To Live And Die In LA before his career hit its nadir in the shape of lamentable 'haunted tree' movie The Guardian. 'I was misguided,' he sighs. 'I came to the view, shortly after making it, that it was rubbish. I had a bum-steer. The attempt was to make a sort of fairytale - the brothers Grimm set in modern times. Even at early audience previews it seemed to be working.' In fact many critics found it difficult to decide whether it was the tree or Jenny Seagrove who delivered the most plank-like performance. After the equally appalling thriller Jade he was reduced to a made-for-cable remake of Sidney Lumet classic 12 Angry Men, which boasted an eclectic cast including Jack Lemmon and Who's The Boss star and one-time TV pin-up Tony Danza. And then Rules Of Engagement arrived. 'I think most Americans regard the government as either corrupt or inept,' he says when asked what in the movie had struck a cord with US audiences. 'And most of the military believe that about the bureaucracy that controls them. The film is really an examination of the actions of this man. Was what he did an act of extreme courage? To me that is an open question in the film. The verdict given is not necessarily the verdict that I find satisfactory.' Hmmm. Friedkin and ambiguity. Frankly you're reminded of Mel Brooks's comment regarding subtlety. 'Subtlety? I got subtlety blowin' outta my ass!' In his darker moments it appears that Friedkin is well aware of unfulfilled potential.'The thing that drove me and keeps me going is Citizen Kane . I hope to one day make a film to rank with that. I haven't yet,' he told Peter Biskind, author of the seminal Seventies chronicle Easy Riders Raging Bulls. Whatever the merits of Rules Of Engagement, it has put Friedkin back on the map. Whereas he used to wait years for a project only last week he used the platform of the Moscow Film Festival to announce his next - a biopic of boxer Sonny Liston with Ving Rhames in the lead role. But given Friedkin's continuing form, Orson Welles can rest easy. \u0095 Rules of Engagement opens 11 August",

      "body": "<p>Splashing happily in my bath with its glorious view of the Zambezi uninterrupted by anything so mundane as a window, or even a screen, I heard someone chuckling slowly through a tuba. 'Hunh-hunh-hunh,' he laughed, from somewhere below my verandah. 'Hunh-hunh-hunh.' I shifted uneasily and took another slug of gin and tonic. Next, the chuckler started crashing through the undergrowth, snapping and splintering the dead branches on the riverbank. I sat up sharply. What's the form for a crisis when you're in the bath? Stay put, I decided and lit a cigarette. And then I figured it out - hippopotamus. 'Hunh-hunh-hunh.' </p> <p>Given what you hear and read about Africa - Aids, malaria, war, corruption, poverty - there's a level of guilt involved in staying in an exclusive and, frankly, idyllic resort like the River Club, watching hippos from your bath. But then you remember that Hoovering as much cash as possible off wealthy tourists is a better alternative to what is happening on the south bank of the Zambezi, in Zimbabwe. For the River Club is in Zambia, near the old colonial hub of Livingstone, on the unspoilt side of Victoria Falls. And people still want to come here. </p> <p>On the Zimbabwean side, where tacky shopping malls and hotel complexes have sprung up alongside the overbearingly colonial Victoria Falls Hotel, things are preternaturally quiet, a direct consequence of the political upheavals and violence that have dominated the headlines. People are not booking safaris anymore. Small beer, you might think, in a country facing economic collapse and where 25 per cent of the population suffers from HIV. Who cares if a few white tourists have their holiday plans disrupted in the face of so much misery? </p> <p>But Zimbabwe is also a country where sources of foreign exchange are drying up faster than its currency devalues. The crisis in tourism has been a blow to the national economy and devastating to the industry. </p> <p>The streets of Harare had more than a whiff of a medium-sized English town in the mid-1970s, right down to the branch of Woolworth's with its pic'n'mix counter. The Foreign Office had warned travellers not to go to the capital, but I didn't feel particularly threatened, just hassled by the hundreds of desperate young men trying to sell cheap souvenirs to a wildly diminished number of tourists. </p> <p>There could be another price to be paid by Zimbabwe's sudden fall from grace as a formerly popular long-haul destination, this time by its wildlife. A few days after my hippo encounter at the River Club, I arrived at Water Wilderness, a handful of houseboats moored on the waters of Lake Kariba inside the Matusadona National Park. This is one of the few regions of the world where you can still see black rhino. (They are not black, of course, and neither are white rhinos white. 'White' is an English corruption of the Afrikaans for 'wide', referring to its lip. Black rhinos, by contrast, have a prehensile upper lip.) Given that a kilo of black rhino horn fetches several thousand dollars, and a mature animal can yield more than three kilos, you can appreciate why there are so few of them. </p> <p>Matusadona has been designated an Intensive Protection Zone by the Zimbabwean government and, soon after putting ashore near the national park headquarters where young rhinos are given round-the-clock armed protection, we saw a park warden ambling through the bush with an AK-47 across his shoulders. He did not want to be photographed and there was a wary distance as he spoke to our guides. </p> <p>In the long term, a live black rhino is worth considerably more to the Zimbabwean economy than a dead one, but if political uncertainty turned into civil war, or corruption undermined the integrity of the national parks, then short-term personal gain would take over again. Rolf Neimeyer, who together with his Afrikaans wife Katinka, runs the Water Wilderness lodge, is a good-humoured and optimistic man who is proud of the fact that black rhino numbers in the Matusadona have recovered from a handful of animals to scores in the past 10 years. He stoops to rub the belly of an 18-month-old rhino called Vora, the Shona word for water. The creature's eyes close in sleepy contentment. Vora weighs 1,000kg and its snout is already worth a small fortune. </p> <p>Another guide was less hopeful. 'So far the protection zone has worked,' he says, 'but you could wipe out the rhino here in a week. If they get the chance the poachers will be back. The dealers in rhino horn want to see the animal extinct. It would increase the value of their stocks.' In one attempt to thwart the poachers, rangers in Zimbabwe sawed the horns off rhino to make them commercially worthless. But poachers killed them anyway, to save themselves the trouble of tracking the same animal a second time. With tourists gone and the revenue they brought drying up, the rhino will be under more pressure than ever from such a ruthless trade. </p> <p>When the rhinos in Matusadona are old enough, they are released into the wild and, despite their early contact with their handlers, seem to revert fully to an inherent distrust of human beings. </p> <p>Elsewhere in the park, we stood mesmerised as a fully grown rhino, Jane, led her two-week-old baby through the thick bush. Over the years, Jane has trashed a grounded helicopter and a couple of Jeeps and watching her clomping through the trees it was easy to see how. Her baby looked impossibly vulnerable, the horn-bud on its nose like some kind of self-inflicted betrayal. Standing in the open only 30 or 40 yards from an adult rhinoceros and its young is not something you easily forget. Nor is the sight of the skulls of dead rhinos outside the park headquarters, the fronts of their faces hacked off with a machete. </p> <p>'Here,' said Rolf, pointing to two deep cuts above the eye sockets. 'These blows were gratuitous. Just for fun.' </p> <p>Two hundred miles to the south-west, in the Hwange National Park, there are wildlife problems of a different kind. The park, with its managed system of pumped water holes, is struggling to deal with a huge number of elephants, as many as 28,000, that are threatening to overwhelm the park's bio-diversity. </p> <p>At dusk we pulled up in our Jeep at a water hole and watched as three separate families of elephants puffed towards us, kicking up clouds of dust in the evening haze, their trunks swinging into the air like periscopes to test our scent. Standing a few yards from a group of animals that appear to be arguing, joking, embracing and teasing each other like any human family, it is impossible to understand why anyone would want to shoot one of these creatures for fun. But then in the topsy-turvy world of nature conservation, such bunny-hugger attitudes are misguided. 'It's quite simple,' Chris, one of the senior guides at Makolo Plains lodge, said. 'This area can support 14,000 elephants. We have 28,000. At times of stress that kind of over-population can strip the vegetation completely. Then lots of elephants will die of starvation. And of course everything else that was relying on that vegetation will die of starvation as well.' There are Western tourists who will pay as much as \u00a3150,000 to kill an elephant - and Western tourists who will pay as much again to keep them alive. Thank goodness we really can't talk to the animals. What would we say? </p> <p>Most people, I would guess, have an image of safaris that involves people sitting in vehicles being driven around, as though Africa were some documentary on an enormous television screen. </p> <p>Of course, it can be like that, but walking across the grasslands of Hwange felt very different. Chris, a gun in his hand for any little emergency, would point out the most insignificant detail, the angle of broken grass or the marks left by a colony of ants, and extrapolate a whole world from them, like guessing the subject of a jigsaw from a single piece. </p> <p>'Look at this buffalo skull,' he said as we paused in the middle of the vast plain under a sky so big it kept dragging my head up to look at it. 'See these deposits under the horns? Those are left by the larvae of a moth that lays its eggs on them.' Then he tossed the skull away and carried on walking. </p> <p>'Is it safe?' people asked when I got back. Perfectly so, it seemed to me, for a tourist. For the people and creatures who live there and seem bedevilled by so many problems, it's a whole different question. </p> <p>\u0095 Ed Douglas travelled to Zimbabwe with Air Zimbabwe, which flies daily to Harare from Gatwick.

      "bodyText": "When John Swinney comes home to Blairgowrie tomorrow morning after a holiday in England, he will be taking one thing at a time. He is the favourite, of bookies and pundits alike, to win the leadership of the SNP in succession to Alex Salmond. But Swinney, 36, a methodical man with an immense capacity for hard work, believes in due process. And so, he told The Observer last week, he will consult colleagues and friends before deciding to take on Alex Neil, 48, who has already thrown his hat into the ring for the election, which is to be held at the party's annual conference in Inverness in September. Last week Salmond, who stunned the Scottish political world with his announcement on Monday that after 10 years as leader he had decided to 'hand on the torch while it was burning brightly', was in relaxed and cheerful mood. Yesterday he went to the Open Championship at St Andrews, continuing to assert that behind his decision to stand down there was no hidden agenda. He challenged the Scottish press, its ears cocked for the rattle of skeletons in the cupboard, to investigate his affairs as thoroughly as it liked. There was nothing to find, he insisted. He will continue as an MSP and will undertake any job the party asks him to do. But his immediate aim is go back to his old m\u00e9tier - he is a professional economist - of developing the party's economic policies. He believes that a consensus is building, among Tories and Liberal Democrats, as well as Nationalists, that the Scottish Parliament should have fiscal autonomy. Yet many analysts think that behind his decision lies a curious and interesting subtext. They argue that the leadership contest Salmond has so suddenly provoked is a showdown with his old enemy, Jim Sillars. But the two old gunfighters will stay in the saloon while their proxies fight it out on the street. Their enmity, a running sore in the party since 1990 when Salmond beat Margaret Ewing for the leadership and Sillars stood aside, broke into the open last week. Sun columnist Sillars greeted the leader's departure with rare biliousness. 'I will not join in the hypocritical praise that will be heaped upon Alex Salmond now that he has snuffed out his political life at the top. He was never big enough for the times. He was nothing but a manipulator, and remains so right to the end.' Sillars's wife, the MSP Margo MacDonald, who has for long made little secret of her dislike of Salmond, also believes that the retiring leader has underestimated the resentment that has built up among ordinary party members. 'They are fed up with autocratic decisions being imposed on them,' she said last week. 'The party does not like being bounced into policy positions.' She believes that Neil has a fighting chance of winning. The leadership, she says, has also underestimated the support Neil has built up by indefatigably cultivating the branches up and down the country. Even his celebrated gaffe - when he compared George Robertson, then Shadow Scottish Secretary, to 'Lord Haw Haw' at a party conference - will not hurt him. 'It never really bothered party members anyway,' she said with a chuckle, though to many observers the comment, re-run on television last week as soon as Neil announced he was standing, continues to pose a question about his judgment. Neil is nothing if not a Sillars acolyte, his constant sidekick from the days when Sillars first came to prominence in Ayrshire as a rising Labour star, through the brief and traumatic life of the breakaway Scottish Labour Party in 1975, to both men's final migration into the SNP. He has been policy vice-convener since 1994 and is MSP for Central Scotland . Criticism of Salmond centres on the election campaign for the Scottish Parliament last May. He is accused of making serious misjudgments and arriving at key decisions without adequate consultation. Among his errors, his critics say, were his decision to denounce the Nato action in Kosovo, to campaign on the slogan of 'Scotland's penny' (reversing Labour's tax cut) and, when the going got tough, to waste the party's money on a tabloid paper that 'nobody read'. At last year's conference MacDonald told members that some people had 'lost the plot'. Forget buzzwords like modernisation, she said: the real issue, neglected by the leadership, was independence. It was at the conference, too, that Salmond's problems with party treasurer Ian Blackford surfaced. Blackford implicitly held Salmond accountable for the party's mounting debts - recently put at \u00a3400,000 but now being paid off - and explicitly denounced his 'dereliction of duty' in failing to make independence the party's top pri ority. In June the party executive passed a vote of no confidence in Blackford in his absence. Salmond's friends saw in the episode the hand of Sillars once again. 'Blackford,' said one last week, 'is just a Sillars cypher.' This skirmish, as much as anything, seems to have convinced Salmond that the time had come to crush the Sillars faction. This interpretation is lent weight by Salmond's continuing buoyancy. This is not a man tired of life or of politics. His predecessor, Gordon Wilson, quit after 10 years in the job because the workload in his Dundee legal practice was overwhelming him. Wilson, now an elder statesman on the party's National Council, recollected last week: 'Things which were once interesting and exciting became drudgery.' His verdict on Salmond is a generous one. 'The absence of his debating gifts, for example, will be a real loss.' Yet Wilson also acknowledges that the party has been given the chance to reassess its constitutional options as the general election app-roaches. It will be fighting all 72 seats and more than half the candidates have already been chosen. But its six Westminster MPs have all chosen Holyrood instead. Strategists believe that in its eagerness to establish its credibility in the Scottish Parliament the party has allowed its core message to become muted. The manifesto for the Scottish elections last year, for example, made no mention of seeking to expand the Parliament's powers. Such anxieties spread beyond the Sillarsite faction. Matters came to the boil at a National Council in March when a motion sponsored by Salmond - that the party should campaign at elections for a referendum on independence - was passed but by a majority narrow enough to amount to something of a rebuff. The motion was seen as a dilution of the party's traditional view that a majority of seats at Westminster or votes at Holyrood would be a mandate for independence. The leadership has since changed tack and modified its rhetoric to reassert the core aims. Expanding the Parliament's powers is now a key theme.

      "bodyText": "Mo Mowlam triggered fresh controversy yesterday by admitting that she approved the bugging of a car used by Sinn Fein leaders during peace talks. The former Northern Ireland Secretary defended the operation during the recording of a television chat show to be broadcast tomorrow night. It was condemned by Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, as a 'hugely serious breach of faith' when the tracking device was found by republicans last year. But while the confirmation that she authorised the bugging will not surprise anyone involved, it breaks a long-held convention that politicians do not comment in public on security matters. Tories yesterday accused her of an 'appalling' indiscretion, while republican sources suggested she could be called on to defend her actions in court. The bug was discovered inside the body of a Ford Mondeo loaned by a woman supporter to Adams and Martin McGuinness - education minister in the devolved Northern Ireland executive - amid speculation that their driver was the real surveillance target. Asked about the bugging on the pre-recorded BBC1 show You Only Live Once , hosted by Nick Hancock, Mowlam said it was part of efforts to break a deadlock on decommissioning, adding: 'Lives were being lost. A lot was done to make sure we knew what was going on.' Although the Government has always refused even to confirm that British intelligence services were involved, it was clear at the time such a politically sensitive operation could only have been cleared at the highest levels within the Northern Ireland Office. But it is thought to be the first time a secretary of state has discussed the bugging of political opponents so openly. A Sinn Fein spokesman said her admission was 'disappointing but not surprising. There can be little doubt that this was part of a \"securocrat\" agenda which is still intent on subverting the peace process. 'Bad faith is a trait which appears inherent in the British Government particularly when dealing with Ireland,' he added.

'These are delicate security matters which are also politically sensitive, so I am appalled that Mo Mowlam has seen fit to blab on a television chat show. It would have been wiser particularly at a time when the process is moving on, for her to remain silent.' Mowlam makes a point of appearing on unorthodox programmes, arguing that politicians need to reach out to voters who would switch off from a dry current affairs show: her candour and warmth also suit chat shows. Her recent appearance on the camp Channel 4 show So Graham Norton , giving away a bearded collie in a 'dog wedding' and telling bawdy jokes, went down a storm with viewers but raised the odd eyebrow in Westminster. Chat shows carry pitfalls for unwary politicians: former Northern Ireland minister Peter Brooke was unwisely inveigled into singing My Darling Clementine on Ireland's The Late, Late Show on the day of the 1992 Teebane massacre in which seven people were killed.",

Tel: 01947 603 568. </p> <p> <strong> Why?</strong> St Hilda's shrouded ghost has been seen in one of the windows, but a more tragic story is attached to the other ghost, believed to be Constance de Beverley. She broke her vows by falling for a knight named Marmion and as punishment she was led to cell, bricked in and left to die. </p> <p> <strong> Scarborough Castle, <br>Yorkshire </strong></p> <p><strong>Who?</strong> Piers Gaveston, Edward II's lover. </p> <p> <strong> Where?</strong> The site has been strategically important since the Iron Age, but became a royal stronghold in the north in the twelfth century. Open daily from 10am to 6pm (adults \u00a32.30, children \u00a31.20). Tel: 01723 372451. </p> <p> <strong> Why? </strong> The Earl of Warwick drove Gaveston to the castle, and beheaded him. The headless ghost still haunts the remains and is said to try to push sightseers off the castle battlements. </p> <p> <strong> Okehampton Castle, Devon </strong></p> <p><strong>Who?</strong> 'Wicked' Lady Howard. </p> <p> <strong> Where? </strong> Another set of ruins, this time of the largest castle in Devon, but also with decidedly uneerie woodland walks and picnic spots. Open daily 10am to 6pm (adults \u00a32.30, children \u00a31.20). Tel: 01837 52844 </p> <p> <strong> Why?</strong> Lady Howard is alleged to have murdered all four of her husbands and then is supposed to have built a coach from their bones. Appropriately, it is also said that she employed a headless coachman and headless horses and rides to the castle every night. Watch out for the one-eyed dog. </p> <p> <strong> Blickling Hall, Norfolk </strong></p> <p><strong>Who? </strong> Anne Boleyn. </p> <p> <strong> Where?</strong> Blickling, a superb Jacobean house with parkland and a lake, is open Wednesday to Sunday from 1pm to 4.30pm (\u00a36.50; garden only, \u00a33.70). Tel: 01263 738030. </p> <p> <strong> Why?</strong> Anne Boleyn spent much of her childhood in a medieval house around which Blickling Hall was built. Rumour suggests she still returns to the place where she was happy. </p> <p> <strong> Buckland Abbey, Devon</strong> </p> <p><strong> Who?</strong> Sir Francis Drake. </p> <p> <strong> Where?</strong> Drake secretly bought Buckland from a rival, Sir Richard Grenville, just before setting off with the Armada. It is open daily except Thursdays (adults \u00a34.50, family \u00a311.20). Tel: 01822 853 607. </p> <p> <strong> Why?</strong> Drake seems to have inspired many supernatural stories. On display inside the house, along with banners from the Golden Hind, is his drum which is said to sound whenever England is in danger. The last time it was supposed to have been heard was when the German fleet were gathering during the First World War. </p> <p> <strong> Magdalen College, Oxford </strong></p> <p><strong>Who?</strong> Various black-clad figures. </p> <p> <strong> Where?</strong> The college, on The High in Oxford, was founded in 1458 by Bishop Waynflete and its original site included a thirteenth-century hospital and burial ground. </p> <p> <strong> Why?</strong> It easy to be sceptical, but it appears that these are not apparitions of the alcoholic variety. The most recent manifestation was in February 1987 when a resting language student was woken by the sound of mysterious mutterings and saw the locked door of her room open. A presence then leant over her. The Rev Jeffrey John even felt it was necessary to bless her room. In 1968 a student walking towards the Colonnade arches saw a silent gliding figure, but inside the cowls of its gown there was no face and it vanished in brighter light.

A knight, Sir Guy the Seeker, and a maiden. Where? The cliffhanging ruins of fourteenth-century Dunstanburgh, still hinting of its original grandeur, can be found near Alnwick. It is open daily from 10am to 6pm (adults \u00a31.80, children 90p). Tel: 01665 576 231. Why? The story goes that when Sir Guy rode up to the castle he found the drawbridge lowered and a lantern leading him to an ornate chamber in which a beautiful woman was trapped. He was offered the choice of a sword or a horn to help her and chose to summon help with the horn - at which point the vision vanished. His ghost can be seen lamenting the wrong decision, while the maiden still waits in the ruins for rescue. Whitby Abbey, Yorkshire Who? Two nuns, one of whom is St Hilda, the founder. Where?

He haunts Britain's second highest mountain, Ben Macdhui in the Cairngorms. Climbers since 1831 have reported the sound of his footsteps, then feelings of intense melancholy and despair, followed by terror.

      "body": "<p>British judges have traditionally undervalued freedom of the press and of speech. That is why cases like Thalidomide (contempt of court), Spycatcher (breach of confidence), Harriet Harman (contempt of court), Tolstoy (libel damages), and Goodwin (journalist's refusal to disclose confidential source) were taken successfully to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. Until recently, only a tiny minority of British judges took free speech seriously. Today, the position is changing dramatically. Our courts, influenced by the European Court of Human Rights, are giving judgments based on a strong commitment to human rights.</p> <p>Last week's landmark rulings in the Shipman and Shayler cases show how senior judges are protecting free speech more strongly on the eve of the coming into force of the Human Rights Act 1998 on 2 October.

      "bodyText": "British judges have traditionally undervalued freedom of the press and of speech. That is why cases like Thalidomide (contempt of court), Spycatcher (breach of confidence), Harriet Harman (contempt of court), Tolstoy (libel damages), and Goodwin (journalist's refusal to disclose confidential source) were taken successfully to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. Until recently, only a tiny minority of British judges took free speech seriously. Today, the position is changing dramatically. Our courts, influenced by the European Court of Human Rights, are giving judgments based on a strong commitment to human rights. Last week's landmark rulings in the Shipman and Shayler cases show how senior judges are protecting free speech more strongly on the eve of the coming into force of the Human Rights Act 1998 on 2 October. Their decisions mean that the Strasbourg Court will probably be less burdened with future British cases fettering freedom of information and public discussion.

      "body": "<p>Four years ago, in the Libyan coastal city of Sirte, there was a small explosion. It scattered the cavalcade of Colonel Gadaffi, who was attending a party congress in his home town and alternative capital. In the shoot-out that followed between the Libyan leader's personal bodyguards and Islamic fundamentalists hoping to spark a coup, several innocent civilians were killed.</p> <p>At the time, apart from a few lines in the Arab press, the attack attracted little media coverage - another day, another attempt on the Libyan leader's life. Such is the haziness surrounding the events, it is still not known whether the explosion was caused by a bomb under one of the cars in the cavalcade or a grenade thrown from the crowd. The fundamentalists had failed where many had tried before.</p> <p>But last week, the shockwaves from that blast in an obscure part of a distant and barely understood country reverberated through the highest courts in England. On Friday, in Court No1 of the Royal Courts of Justice, Lord Justice Igor Judge found that the Guardian and The Observer were right to resist police attempts to force them to hand over documents relating to claims by former MI5 officer David Shayler that the British intelligence service had been involved in the Sirte bombing.</p> <p>Invoking the spirit of Voltaire and Pitt the Elder, the judge made the most ringing defence of freedom of expression heard in an English courtroom for many years. He said freedom of expression was 'bred in the bone' of English Common Law.</p> <p>His decision established, beyond all doubt, the right of the press to investigate and report allegations of serious crime even when they involve members of the security services. Recognising the full gravity of the alleged assassination attempt, Lord Justice Judge said: 'If true, it is difficult to overestimate its enormity: a conspiracy to murder the head of another state, resulting not in his death, but in the deaths of innocent people who were not its intended targets.'</p> <p>He added: 'Again, if true, the circumstances in which such a plan was conceived and developed, and the identity of those who were informed about and approved it, or turned a blind eye to it, and equally those who were deliberately kept in ignorance, raise critical public issues about the activities of the security services and those responsible for them.'</p> <p>In a ringing endorsement of the role of the press in a free society, he added: 'The story of the Gadaffi plot is either true or it is false, and unless there are compelling reasons of national security, the public is entitled to know the facts, and as the the eyes and ears of the public, journalists are entitled to investigate and report the facts, as I hope they would, dispassionately and fairly, without prejudgment or selectivity.'</p> <p>When Shayler's claims were originally made public in August 1998, the Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, described them as 'pure fantasy'. A top secret document that appeared on the internet in February appeared to undermine this claim. The so-called CX-report demonstrated that MI6 had full knowledge of a plot to kill Gadaffi in 1995. Shayler, who worked in the Libyan section of MI5 at the time, claimed that an MI6 officer paid money to the plotters and later claimed credit for the assassination attempt.</p> <p>The Mail on Sunday originally attempted to publish his claims in August 1998. Hours after editors at the paper submitted the article to government lawyers, who decided it was too hot to publish, French intelligence officers swooped on the Paris hotel where Shayler was staying and arrested him for extradition to Britain. Journalists who worked on the story for the Mail on Sunday remain convinced the two events are connected. Shayler spent three months in La Sant\u00e9 prison in Paris before the French courts threw out Britain's extradition request. The story of the plot was eventually revealed in a BBC Panorama programme and published in an American newspaper before the British press felt able to publish.</p> <p>Lord Justice Judge made it clear that, in future, the police should not interfere with journalists investigating the Shayler affair. As one journalist involved in the story told the human rights magazine Index on Censorship: 'They put us in the position that we have to break the law to break the news.'</p> <p>The police first approached The Observer and the Guardian for documents in March this year. The Guardian had printed a letter from Shayler complaining about an article by their resident expert on the intelligence services, Richard Norton-Taylor. In court, the police argued that they needed a copy of the original email sent by Shayler to the Guardian because it might reveal his email address and prove that the former MI5 man had made revelations that were in breach of the Official Secrets Act. Last week's judicial review hearing threw this out without ceremony.</p> <p>In the words of the judgment, The Observer case was 'more difficult'. On 27 February 2000, we published a story entitled 'Two Spies Named in Libya Plot'. In this we claimed that Shayler had written to Jack Straw in November 1999 with full details of what he knew about the assassination attempt. He demanded a full investigation and identified the officers he thought were responsible, or knew about the plans.</p> <p>After legal advice and discussions with the Treasury Solicitor and MI5, no injunction was sought against the paper. Only afterwards did the police inform the newspaper that there had been a serious breach of national security. On Wednesday of the following week, Special Branch told The Observer that it was investigating offences, not only under Section One of the Official Secrets Act, which refers to revelations by former employees, but also Section Five, which refers to the passing on of information by third parties, such as journalists.</p> <p>At the end of March the newspapers were in court for refusing to produce the documents. After three days of argument in the Old Bailey, Judge Martin Stephens QC stated: 'In my judgment, it is in the public interest that the material sought should be made available.' It was this decision that was successfully appealed on Friday.</p> <p>The arguments in this case have largely concentrated on rights enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights, which is expected to become part of British law on 2 October. Lawyers acting for the newspapers said that the police action was clearly in breach of Article 10 of the convention, which guarantees freedom of expression. But they also argued that the action was in breach of Article 6, which guarantees the rights of suspects not to incriminate themselves. As the Crown Prosecution Service had consistently refused to give an undertaking that The Observer journalists would not face prosecution, it was said that they were protected by the convention.</p> <p>Lord Justice Judge stated that most of the rights being claimed by the newspapers' lawyers were already enshrined in English common law. His remarks were therefore as much a celebration of the English judicial system as they were a celebration of free speech. In an extraordinary flourish he turned to the words of former first minister William Pitt who famously said: 'The poorest man may in his cottage bid defiance to all the forces of the Crown.'</p> <p>In a clear swipe at Europe he added that 'these principles were clearly understood in this country while an absolute monarch still reigned in France.' He said that the Bourbon monarch Louis XV would simply not have tolerated such language. Voltaire, he said, imprisoned twice by the French government, had a great respect for the English constitution. It is something of an irony in this case that while, in the 18th century, Voltaire had to find refuge in London for speaking out, David Shayler has been forced to find refuge in Paris.</p> <p>The full implications of Lord Justice Judge's decision will take some time to emerge. But his conclusions about the inadequacy of the police operation will certainly have an immediate effect on the way Special Branch proceeds against newspapers in the future. The judge said: 'Inconvenient or embarrassing revelations, whether for the security services or for public authorities should not be suppressed. Legal proceedings directed towards the working papers of an individual journalist or the premises of a newspaper or television programme publishing his or her reports, or the threat of such proceedings tends to inhibit discussion.'</p> <p>Some believe this judgment will have serious implications for the future of the Official Secrets Act. People who blow the whistle tend to do so to the press. It is hard to imagine how the police will be able to secure convictions without being able to gather evidence from journalists. The forthcoming trial of Shayler, who is expected to return to Britain at the end of August, will be an interesting test case.

      "bodyText": "Four years ago, in the Libyan coastal city of Sirte, there was a small explosion. It scattered the cavalcade of Colonel Gadaffi, who was attending a party congress in his home town and alternative capital. In the shoot-out that followed between the Libyan leader's personal bodyguards and Islamic fundamentalists hoping to spark a coup, several innocent civilians were killed. At the time, apart from a few lines in the Arab press, the attack attracted little media coverage - another day, another attempt on the Libyan leader's life. Such is the haziness surrounding the events, it is still not known whether the explosion was caused by a bomb under one of the cars in the cavalcade or a grenade thrown from the crowd. The fundamentalists had failed where many had tried before. But last week, the shockwaves from that blast in an obscure part of a distant and barely understood country reverberated through the highest courts in England. On Friday, in Court No1 of the Royal Courts of Justice, Lord Justice Igor Judge found that the Guardian and The Observer were right to resist police attempts to force them to hand over documents relating to claims by former MI5 officer David Shayler that the British intelligence service had been involved in the Sirte bombing. Invoking the spirit of Voltaire and Pitt the Elder, the judge made the most ringing defence of freedom of expression heard in an English courtroom for many years. He said freedom of expression was 'bred in the bone' of English Common Law. His decision established, beyond all doubt, the right of the press to investigate and report allegations of serious crime even when they involve members of the security services. Recognising the full gravity of the alleged assassination attempt, Lord Justice Judge said: 'If true, it is difficult to overestimate its enormity: a conspiracy to murder the head of another state, resulting not in his death, but in the deaths of innocent people who were not its intended targets.' He added: 'Again, if true, the circumstances in which such a plan was conceived and developed, and the identity of those who were informed about and approved it, or turned a blind eye to it, and equally those who were deliberately kept in ignorance, raise critical public issues about the activities of the security services and those responsible for them.' In a ringing endorsement of the role of the press in a free society, he added: 'The story of the Gadaffi plot is either true or it is false, and unless there are compelling reasons of national security, the public is entitled to know the facts, and as the the eyes and ears of the public, journalists are entitled to investigate and report the facts, as I hope they would, dispassionately and fairly, without prejudgment or selectivity.' When Shayler's claims were originally made public in August 1998, the Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, described them as 'pure fantasy'. A top secret document that appeared on the internet in February appeared to undermine this claim. The so-called CX-report demonstrated that MI6 had full knowledge of a plot to kill Gadaffi in 1995. Shayler, who worked in the Libyan section of MI5 at the time, claimed that an MI6 officer paid money to the plotters and later claimed credit for the assassination attempt. The Mail on Sunday originally attempted to publish his claims in August 1998. Hours after editors at the paper submitted the article to government lawyers, who decided it was too hot to publish, French intelligence officers swooped on the Paris hotel where Shayler was staying and arrested him for extradition to Britain. Journalists who worked on the story for the Mail on Sunday remain convinced the two events are connected. Shayler spent three months in La Sant\u00e9 prison in Paris before the French courts threw out Britain's extradition request. The story of the plot was eventually revealed in a BBC Panorama programme and published in an American newspaper before the British press felt able to publish. Lord Justice Judge made it clear that, in future, the police should not interfere with journalists investigating the Shayler affair. As one journalist involved in the story told the human rights magazine Index on Censorship: 'They put us in the position that we have to break the law to break the news.' The police first approached The Observer and the Guardian for documents in March this year. The Guardian had printed a letter from Shayler complaining about an article by their resident expert on the intelligence services, Richard Norton-Taylor. In court, the police argued that they needed a copy of the original email sent by Shayler to the Guardian because it might reveal his email address and prove that the former MI5 man had made revelations that were in breach of the Official Secrets Act. Last week's judicial review hearing threw this out without ceremony. In the words of the judgment, The Observer case was 'more difficult'. On 27 February 2000, we published a story entitled 'Two Spies Named in Libya Plot'. In this we claimed that Shayler had written to Jack Straw in November 1999 with full details of what he knew about the assassination attempt. He demanded a full investigation and identified the officers he thought were responsible, or knew about the plans. After legal advice and discussions with the Treasury Solicitor and MI5, no injunction was sought against the paper. Only afterwards did the police inform the newspaper that there had been a serious breach of national security. On Wednesday of the following week, Special Branch told The Observer that it was investigating offences, not only under Section One of the Official Secrets Act, which refers to revelations by former employees, but also Section Five, which refers to the passing on of information by third parties, such as journalists. At the end of March the newspapers were in court for refusing to produce the documents. After three days of argument in the Old Bailey, Judge Martin Stephens QC stated: 'In my judgment, it is in the public interest that the material sought should be made available.' It was this decision that was successfully appealed on Friday. The arguments in this case have largely concentrated on rights enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights, which is expected to become part of British law on 2 October. Lawyers acting for the newspapers said that the police action was clearly in breach of Article 10 of the convention, which guarantees freedom of expression. But they also argued that the action was in breach of Article 6, which guarantees the rights of suspects not to incriminate themselves. As the Crown Prosecution Service had consistently refused to give an undertaking that The Observer journalists would not face prosecution, it was said that they were protected by the convention. Lord Justice Judge stated that most of the rights being claimed by the newspapers' lawyers were already enshrined in English common law. His remarks were therefore as much a celebration of the English judicial system as they were a celebration of free speech. In an extraordinary flourish he turned to the words of former first minister William Pitt who famously said: 'The poorest man may in his cottage bid defiance to all the forces of the Crown.' In a clear swipe at Europe he added that 'these principles were clearly understood in this country while an absolute monarch still reigned in France.' He said that the Bourbon monarch Louis XV would simply not have tolerated such language. Voltaire, he said, imprisoned twice by the French government, had a great respect for the English constitution. It is something of an irony in this case that while, in the 18th century, Voltaire had to find refuge in London for speaking out, David Shayler has been forced to find refuge in Paris. The full implications of Lord Justice Judge's decision will take some time to emerge. But his conclusions about the inadequacy of the police operation will certainly have an immediate effect on the way Special Branch proceeds against newspapers in the future. The judge said: 'Inconvenient or embarrassing revelations, whether for the security services or for public authorities should not be suppressed. Legal proceedings directed towards the working papers of an individual journalist or the premises of a newspaper or television programme publishing his or her reports, or the threat of such proceedings tends to inhibit discussion.' Some believe this judgment will have serious implications for the future of the Official Secrets Act. People who blow the whistle tend to do so to the press. It is hard to imagine how the police will be able to secure convictions without being able to gather evidence from journalists. The forthcoming trial of Shayler, who is expected to return to Britain at the end of August, will be an interesting test case. The trial of Nigel Wylde, the army intelligence officer who is the alleged source for Tony Geraghty's book about secret British Army operations in Ireland, The Irish War, will raise similar questions. The case also raises issues around the so-called Defence Advisory or 'D-notice' committee, a loose collection of civil servants and senior journalists to which reporters can submit articles before publication to assess whether they breach national security. The system was not used by The Observer when it published the story about the Libyan plot. Some believe that journalists are effectively submitting to state censorship by working within the system. Stephen Dorril, author of MI6: Fifty Years of Special Operations, published this year, said: 'This judgment is great news. But if editors want to put more teeth into investigative journalism, the first thing they should do is withdraw all co-operation from the D-notice committee. It is totally corrosive.' Others welcomed Friday's ruling while regretting the case had been brought at all. Ian Hargreaves, professor of journalism at Cardiff University and former editor of the Independent, was surprised such a decision was needed under a progressive government: 'There has been a shocking inattentiveness to basic values. It is a pretty extraordinary thing for those of us who have supported this government, that it is consistently left to judges or the House of Lords to assert these kinds of principles.' He added: 'What is going on with this Government, which claims its commitment to freedom of information, but consistently shows slight and insufficient regard for basic personal liberty and personal expression.' Hargreaves said recent legislation initiated by Straw on Internet encryption and football hooliganism and the watering down of Freedom of Information legislation all caused serious concern. Meanwhile, the Government has consistently refused to set up an inquiry into the Libyan affair. There is no doubt that the decision in the Royal Courts of Justice struck a blow for freedom of expression in this country, but it is still likely to be a long time before we get anywhere near the full truth about that explosion in an obscure city in northern Libya.",

Cleav'd, cleaving, heaving clear to murder: <br> The unicorn of crime-beasts. White sweat-flecked in dreams, yet fled when awake, and only empty black remains <br></p> <p>Anyway, there you go. A bit under 30 seconds to write that little gem, and you get the idea. It is as easy to write bad poetry as to breathe - easier, perhaps, if like me you've been dry-heaving for most of the week over the cloacal bilge lapping the privileged toes of Britain's favourite granny/appeaser, snob of ballroom and Blitz, our very own rhinestone Flintstone - goodness and this bad writing's catching, but you know who I mean. </p> <p>Most of us grow out of poetry shortly after those terrible bits of scribbled teenage angst (Roses are red/Violets are blue/I hate my parents), leaving us with only two strains worth watching: the memorably bad and the memorably good. There's a heap of fun to be had researching the first - my favourites must be the line from Acadia, by Joseph Howe (1804-73), which runs: 'The gay moose in jocund gambol springs', closely followed by Browning's fantastically shitty 'Irks care the crop-fed bird?' - but the second's a bit harder to deal with. </p> <p>For there are good poets. There were, are, a host of British poets who still manage, as Motion describes, to 'link that side of our minds which is writerly, readerly, and that side of our minds which frankly hasn't a clue what's going on in this primeval swamp, until suddenly, instantly, they're together, and the hairs go up on the back of your neck.' </p> <p>Whether Motion - who, as our Poet Laureate, last week wrote a tribute to the Queen Mum without quite outraging or delighting poets or monarchists - manages this often enough depends on who you listen to. It's probably a bad idea to listen to professional poets, for their closed world is so bitchy it makes your average gay ballet mafia look like a WWII fighter crew; and many harbour a certain bitterness towards him for having taken the post in the first place. </p> <p>Motion, a friend of New Labour and a low-fat monarchist, accepted the job, and argues now that had the post been allowed to die that would have been a poor thing for poetry. But how did he cope, a year on, caught between the sneers of fellow poets and the sighs of those such as Auberon Waugh who think that, if he's going to do it, then at least it should rhyme ? </p> <p>'Well, it's a badge of honour for any self-respecting poet to be criticised by Auberon Waugh. But in a lot of ways my poems are very conventional, and it's no big deal for me to write a poem in either free verse or strict form; modern poets can, and do, do both.' </p> <p>What, I wonder, of his predecessor (and friend), Ted Hughes, whose royal poems, brimming with animal metaphors, were mercilessly lampooned? 'It's difficult to answer this because Ted thought there was a very primitive connection between monarchy and poetry - historically deeply founded, back to the mead hall. And even though few people agreed with him, he was on to something.' (Later, talking about the death of Diana, he comes back to this. He was reported then to be impressed by the quality of the public's poetry. He wasn't, he says. Most of it was 'awful'. But he was impressed by the need to turn to poetry, the primitive connection). </p> <p>'But yes, Ted was probably over-optimistic, and exposing himself to ridicule.' Even, gently, from Motion: I ask about an oblique salmon reference in last week's poem and he grins. 'Yes. That was a sort of homage.' </p> <p>So he's used to ridicule, ready for it, but argues strongly that he was right to take the post and keep it alive. 'Thanks partly to the kind of poets that we now have and partly to funding, there's been a gigantic shift in the way poetry is perceived... Poems on the Underground, poets in schools, football clubs, zoos. </p> <p>'I wanted to reimagine the role, in a way that was respectful of its traditional responsibilities but made them part of a wider pattern of poetry about national incidents, events, preoccupations; and to spend a great deal of time going to schools trying to demystify poetry. While also, importantly, not wanting to dumb it down or pretend the days of 'difficult' poetry are over, because we live in a pluralist culture and there's room for 'difficult' poetry alongside rap and everything else. And poetry won't be for everyone, but everyone should have the choice. </p> <p>Did he consider not doing the Queen Mum's poem? Or inserting a bit more caustic comment? </p> <p>'Yes, it did cross my mind. But I think it would be very strange for me having accepted the position in the first place to write a knocking piece. But it would be equally difficult for me to write a piece which didn't want to be realistic. I tried to create a space in the poem where people can think those thoughts if they choose. </p> <p>'But I can't and don't ever want to write bell-yanking confetti-tossing hat-throwing poems. If people want that they can read Betjeman again. </p> <p>'So over the last year I've tried to come out of the curious sacred wood in which a lot of laureates have lived. I did the TUC conference, the Paddington rail crash - which produced an extraordinary response - Childline, Mandela.' </p> <p>Would he write on politics, I wonder, after he's spoken of his 'deep disappointment' at the leaked Blair memo? 'I might, some day. I am a party member so I'll need a lot of persuading to go against them. Although ... I have kind of written up over the door into my mind a phrase of Keats', where he says \"We hate poetry that has a palpable design on us.\" In other words if you pursue a narrow line on anything the chances are it will damage what is poetic in your poem. If we want to read pure ideas we read essays or philosophy; if we want to feel ideas, on our pulses, then we read poems.' </p> <p>Neither Downing Street nor Buckingham Palace, he says, tells him what to write, 'and I'm not going to write something if it doesn't chime with thoughts I'm having already. The Dome asked me, and I thought about writing on Prince William's birthday, but if nothing chimes... words in order are not enough, these have got to be poems, and I could probably turn something out but it wouldn't be a poem, it would be a ditty.' </p> <p>He's a charmer, our Poet Laureate, a smoothie. Sandy and suave and mellifluous, a delight to talk to, and one of those easy languid types who can always turn the charm up one more notch when needed; I can't help the suspicion that had I been wearing a skirt the wattage would have moved to open flirting. By the end I've almost forgiven him for the poem. Almost.</p>",

There's a heap of fun to be had researching the first - my favourites must be the line from Acadia, by Joseph Howe (1804-73), which runs: 'The gay moose in jocund gambol springs', closely followed by Browning's fantastically shitty 'Irks care the crop-fed bird?' - but the second's a bit harder to deal with. For there are good poets. There were, are, a host of British poets who still manage, as Motion describes, to 'link that side of our minds which is writerly, readerly, and that side of our minds which frankly hasn't a clue what's going on in this primeval swamp, until suddenly, instantly, they're together, and the hairs go up on the back of your neck.' Whether Motion - who, as our Poet Laureate, last week wrote a tribute to the Queen Mum without quite outraging or delighting poets or monarchists - manages this often enough depends on who you listen to. It's probably a bad idea to listen to professional poets, for their closed world is so bitchy it makes your average gay ballet mafia look like a WWII fighter crew; and many harbour a certain bitterness towards him for having taken the post in the first place. Motion, a friend of New Labour and a low-fat monarchist, accepted the job, and argues now that had the post been allowed to die that would have been a poor thing for poetry. But how did he cope, a year on, caught between the sneers of fellow poets and the sighs of those such as Auberon Waugh who think that, if he's going to do it, then at least it should rhyme ? 'Well, it's a badge of honour for any self-respecting poet to be criticised by Auberon Waugh. But in a lot of ways my poems are very conventional, and it's no big deal for me to write a poem in either free verse or strict form; modern poets can, and do, do both.' What, I wonder, of his predecessor (and friend), Ted Hughes, whose royal poems, brimming with animal metaphors, were mercilessly lampooned? 'It's difficult to answer this because Ted thought there was a very primitive connection between monarchy and poetry - historically deeply founded, back to the mead hall. And even though few people agreed with him, he was on to something.' (Later, talking about the death of Diana, he comes back to this. He was reported then to be impressed by the quality of the public's poetry. He wasn't, he says. Most of it was 'awful'. But he was impressed by the need to turn to poetry, the primitive connection). 'But yes, Ted was probably over-optimistic, and exposing himself to ridicule.' Even, gently, from Motion: I ask about an oblique salmon reference in last week's poem and he grins. 'Yes. That was a sort of homage.' So he's used to ridicule, ready for it, but argues strongly that he was right to take the post and keep it alive. 'Thanks partly to the kind of poets that we now have and partly to funding, there's been a gigantic shift in the way poetry is perceived... Poems on the Underground, poets in schools, football clubs, zoos. 'I wanted to reimagine the role, in a way that was respectful of its traditional responsibilities but made them part of a wider pattern of poetry about national incidents, events, preoccupations; and to spend a great deal of time going to schools trying to demystify poetry. While also, importantly, not wanting to dumb it down or pretend the days of 'difficult' poetry are over, because we live in a pluralist culture and there's room for 'difficult' poetry alongside rap and everything else. And poetry won't be for everyone, but everyone should have the choice. Did he consider not doing the Queen Mum's poem? Or inserting a bit more caustic comment? 'Yes, it did cross my mind. But I think it would be very strange for me having accepted the position in the first place to write a knocking piece. But it would be equally difficult for me to write a piece which didn't want to be realistic. I tried to create a space in the poem where people can think those thoughts if they choose. 'But I can't and don't ever want to write bell-yanking confetti-tossing hat-throwing poems. If people want that they can read Betjeman again. 'So over the last year I've tried to come out of the curious sacred wood in which a lot of laureates have lived. I did the TUC conference, the Paddington rail crash - which produced an extraordinary response - Childline, Mandela.' Would he write on politics, I wonder, after he's spoken of his 'deep disappointment' at the leaked Blair memo? 'I might, some day. I am a party member so I'll need a lot of persuading to go against them. Although ... I have kind of written up over the door into my mind a phrase of Keats', where he says \"We hate poetry that has a palpable design on us.\" In other words if you pursue a narrow line on anything the chances are it will damage what is poetic in your poem. If we want to read pure ideas we read essays or philosophy; if we want to feel ideas, on our pulses, then we read poems.' Neither Downing Street nor Buckingham Palace, he says, tells him what to write, 'and I'm not going to write something if it doesn't chime with thoughts I'm having already. The Dome asked me, and I thought about writing on Prince William's birthday, but if nothing chimes... words in order are not enough, these have got to be poems, and I could probably turn something out but it wouldn't be a poem, it would be a ditty.' He's a charmer, our Poet Laureate, a smoothie. Sandy and suave and mellifluous, a delight to talk to, and one of those easy languid types who can always turn the charm up one more notch when needed; I can't help the suspicion that had I been wearing a skirt the wattage would have moved to open flirting. By the end I've almost forgiven him for the poem. Almost.",

In an age where a single picture of Posh and Becks can generate an avalanche of gossip, why have so few heard of Griffith's OneWorldLive or Jackson's HollywoodTickets? Atom Films, an entertainment site which licenses short films, believes the net community simply is not interested in stars. 'Certainly there's an audience that always goes to see Julia Roberts,' said Matt Hulett, Atom's chief online officer. 'But the internet visitor isn't the same breed of audience: our films starring George Clooney (pictured) and Cate Blanchett have proved far less popular than our animated Bikini Bandit series or the Joe Cartoon clips, where you get to mutilate gerbils.' There seems to be a distinct parting between Hollywood and the internet audience, which wants interactivity. 'Are the celebrities coming to the net willing to dismantle those walls, get their hands really dirty in the day-to-day of a dotcom?' asked Janelle Brown, an internet journalist. 'The celebrity site is just another boring dotcom unless the star chooses to get down with those fans and evangelises interactively.'",

      "body": "<p>Nothing tempts like a tart. The buttery crust crumbles under your fork, the savoury filling quivers. You lift it slowly, carefully, from plate to mouth so as not to lose even the tiniest bit down your shirt. The pastry melts in your mouth, the filling dissolves on your tongue. A crumb falls, a crumb that you will rescue later with a licked finger. No roast, no cake, no fruit can tempt and please the way a slice of warm, home-baked tart does. </p> <p>The other day, a book appeared on my kitchen table which reminded me of this. A book filled with the sort of recipes dreams are made of. Not a vast tome, but a slim and understated one. A book for a day when you have no one but yourself to cook for, a kitchen all to yourself. It was an entire book devoted to the tart. There were tarts of seafood and cream, of spinach and anchovies, of lemons and cherries. There were round potato tarts, oblong pissaladi\u00e8res and crinkle-edged bacon quiches. There were big tarts of leeks and tiny ones of haddock, fat tarts, thin tarts, and tarts to make you laugh, by which I mean one laced with tobacco that has apparently been banned from the American edition. The book had the come-hither title of The Art of the Tart (\u00a316.99, Cassell). </p> <p>There is something about baking a pastry case and filling it with something good that appeals to me as much as making any cake or tray of biscuits. Every moment of such a recipe is a moment of pure rapture - from the satiny feel of the dough as you push it into the tin with your floury fingers to the quiver of the custard as you proudly take your handiwork from the oven. This is the sort of cooking you always promise yourself you will do more of, because it turns making supper into a recreation rather than work. Making Bakewell tart ain't cooking, it is pure therapy. </p> <p>Of course, this is not supper in seconds (though a tomato tart can be on the table in 20 minutes), it is cooking in layers. First you must tend to the pastry and bake it, then mix the filling, carefully loading the tart so that it is thick and generous, but not so full that it overflows its crust. You must carry your laden tin oh-so-carefully to the oven, watching the custard ebb and flow perilously toward the rim. And try your best not to lose concentration at the last minute, your egg and cream custard dribbling and burning on the hot oven door. </p> <p>According to Tamasin Day-Lewis, author of The Art of the Tart, there is nothing complicated about this sort of cooking, it is just that the process is simply longer. Perhaps that explains why I get such quiet delight from it. Nothing complex or showy, just slow, peaceful pottering in the kitchen. You pick your day, making sure you will not be interrupted, and set to it. I think that Radio 4 should be on, or perhaps even some music. Then there is the softly tactile quality of sifted flour in your palms, the richesse of the butter (nothing less will do) and the luxury of the double cream. The raw pastry feels as soft as silk and the smell from the oven is the finest antidote there ever was to the Working Week. </p> <p>Gazing dreamily at the pictures of Flamiche and Brandade tart, it is easy to forget how practical a great cartwheel of a pie can be. I know it is tempting to do more, but this is what to put on the table when people come round for a light lunch. I do think the pastry should be warm, fresh from the oven, but the rest can be a hotchpotch of the bought and the ready-made. Some hunks of cheese, slices of ham from the bone and some salad (perhaps flageolet beans and rocket) can be scattered round the table for guests to help themselves. Nothing we can make and offer our friends is likely to go down better than home baking. Especially if that baking is savoury. Those of us who do get round to putting pastry in a tart tin are more than likely to do so with pudding in mind. Something filled with vegetables or fish is likely to win even more smiles. </p> <p>Today I decided on a tart of haddock and watercress. To be honest, it had been a bit of a toss-up between that and one with crab and cream. But the haddock won. Softly smoky, the fish was held lightly in a small amount of custard. An enchanting recipe, but one that took less time than I had envisaged, so I just had to make tomato tarts as well. The crisp pastry, the luscious centre, those elusive crumbs, all sitting on their baking sheet in my kitchen. Nothing, but nothing tempts like a tart. </p> <p><strong> Tamasin Day-Lewis's tart pastry</strong></p> <p><strong> 120g plain, white organic flour <br> 60g unsalted butter</strong></p> <p> Sift the flour and a pinch of salt into the food processor, then cut the cold butter into small pieces on top of it. I process it for 20-30 seconds, then add ice-cold water through the top, 1 tbsp at a time, with the machine running. About 2 to 2 should do it. If the paste is still in crumbly little bits after a minute or two, add 1 tbsp more of water, but remember, the more water you use, the more your pastry will shrink when you bake it blind. The moment it has cohered into a single ball, stop, remove it, wrap it in clingfilm and put it in the fridge for 30 minutes. </p> <p><strong> Smoked haddock and watercress tart</strong> </p> <p>A lovely recipe from The Art of the Tart. It would make a good first course, although I treated it as a main dish and served it warm the other day with a very plain and straightforward green salad. A good dish for this unpredictable summer. Serves 6. </p> <p><strong>22cm shortcrust pastry case, chilled, made to the above recipe <br> beaten egg for brushing <br> 325g undyed smoked haddock<br> 300ml Jersey milk<br> 30g butter <br> 1 small onion, finely chopped <br> 1 stick of celery, finely chopped <br> 30g plain flour <br> nutmeg <br> a bunch of watercress, stalks removed, finely chopped<br> 2 eggs, beaten<br> 2 tbsp grated Parmesan</strong></p> <p> Preheat the oven to 190 C/gas mark 5. Bake the pastry blind for 10 minutes, then remove the baking beans, prick the base with a fork and brush with beaten egg. Return to the oven for 5 more minutes.</p> <p> Put the haddock and milk in a saucepan and bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for a further 10 minutes. Remove and skin the fish and flake into a bowl. Reserve the milk separately. </p> <p> Heat the butter in a saucepan, add the onion and celery and cook gently, until softened. Stir in the flour and cook for a few minutes, then add the reserved poaching milk and stir until the sauce has thickened. Season with a little salt, pepper and the grated nutmeg. Remove from the heat and stir into the fish, adding the watercress and beaten eggs. </p> <p>Pour into the pastry case and sprinkle the top with grated Parmesan. Bake for 25 minutes, when the tart will have risen and be crusted a delectable golden brown. Leave to cool slightly before turning out and eating hot. </p> <p><strong> Tomato tarts</strong></p> <p> A recipe I have made for years - but it only really comes to life with the sweet-sharp cherry tomatoes that are around now. I sometimes put in some chopped anchovy with the oil and basil, in which case I tend to use less salt. Makes 6. </p> <p><strong>425g puff pastry <br> 4 tbsp peppery, extra-virgin olive oil<br> a small bunch of basil <br> 2 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed<br> the leaves of a couple of sprigs of thyme<br> about 30 small cherry tomatoes </strong></p> <p>Set the oven at 230 C/gas mark 8. Roll out the pastry - you want it to be really thin, about the same thickness as a pound coin. Using a large saucer as a template, cut six discs of pastry and lift them on to a baking sheet. Place a smaller saucer or large cup in the centre of each circle and score round it without cutting right through the pastry to give a wide rim that will rise and enclose the tomatoes. Prick the centre circles of the pastry lightly with a fork. </p> <p>Pour the oil into a mixing bowl, tear up the basil finely and add it to the oil with the crushed garlic, thyme leaves and a seasoning of salt and quite coarse black pepper. Cut the tomatoes in half, then toss them in the seasoned oil. </p> <p> Pile the tomatoes on to inner circles of the pastry, then brush the edges with some of the oil. Brush the tomatoes generously with any remaining oil. Bake for about 12-15 minutes, watching carefully that they don't burn. Drizzle with any remaining basil oil and serve immediately.</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Collingbourne Ducis is a pretty silly name for a restaurant, even one amid the Georgian splendour and Romanesque ruins of Bath. It sounds like a firm of solicitors or a difficult gymnastics manoeuvre. ('And now Ms Korbet will attempt a triple Collingbourne Ducis.') It certainly doesn't sound like a place you would go for something nice to eat. </p> <p> The owner, Andrew Mellon, who up until now has been cooking for obscenely wealthy private clients in the United States, says it is the name of the West Country village where his parents live and, for good measure, that it was mentioned in Kazuo Ishiguro's novel Remains of the Day. Collingbourne Ducis has that very establishment, 'been here since the Doomsday Book' feel, which was just what he was looking for. Doubtless, Americans will love it; but Mellon is keen to argue that his new place is not only for US tourists - the locals are getting very excited about it too, apparently, and they are bound to form a major part of the clientele. </p> <p>I was, I must admit, not hugely inclined to like the place. The first thing they sent me was not a menu - heaven forfend - but a set of annotated architect's plans complete with schematics for the toilets. I like to know where to go in an emergency as much as the next chap, but I don't need directions in advance. There were also horribly fussy textile samples from the interior designers: lots of heavy red and green stripes for the furniture, and pistachio twill for the uniforms. Again, a kind of faux Englishness that might appeal to those damned colonials, trudging about Bath in search of the echt experience of Albion. </p> <p>Having now been there, though, I have to accept that while, on paper, Collingbourne Ducis is a little contrived, the finished article has a lot going for it and promises greater things to come. It looks not unlike one of those 80s country-house hotels in miniature, only without the bedrooms. There is a pretty, sunlit dining room upfront with a completely over-the-top rococo ceiling, and out back is a woodlined snug of a 'library' for the taking of after dinner drinks and cigars. </p> <p>That said, the dinner service, which is yet to start, is clearly only a part of the deal. Collingbourne Ducis is designed as an all-day affair: home-made muffins and Irish porridge oats at breakfast, croissants and pastries at morning coffee, salads and sandwiches at lunchtime, scones and cakes and cream and jam at tea, leaving just enough time for Welsh rarebit and kedgeree for high tea.

      "bodyText": "Collingbourne Ducis is a pretty silly name for a restaurant, even one amid the Georgian splendour and Romanesque ruins of Bath. It sounds like a firm of solicitors or a difficult gymnastics manoeuvre. ('And now Ms Korbet will attempt a triple Collingbourne Ducis.') It certainly doesn't sound like a place you would go for something nice to eat. The owner, Andrew Mellon, who up until now has been cooking for obscenely wealthy private clients in the United States, says it is the name of the West Country village where his parents live and, for good measure, that it was mentioned in Kazuo Ishiguro's novel Remains of the Day. Collingbourne Ducis has that very establishment, 'been here since the Doomsday Book' feel, which was just what he was looking for. Doubtless, Americans will love it; but Mellon is keen to argue that his new place is not only for US tourists - the locals are getting very excited about it too, apparently, and they are bound to form a major part of the clientele. I was, I must admit, not hugely inclined to like the place. The first thing they sent me was not a menu - heaven forfend - but a set of annotated architect's plans complete with schematics for the toilets. I like to know where to go in an emergency as much as the next chap, but I don't need directions in advance. There were also horribly fussy textile samples from the interior designers: lots of heavy red and green stripes for the furniture, and pistachio twill for the uniforms. Again, a kind of faux Englishness that might appeal to those damned colonials, trudging about Bath in search of the echt experience of Albion. Having now been there, though, I have to accept that while, on paper, Collingbourne Ducis is a little contrived, the finished article has a lot going for it and promises greater things to come. It looks not unlike one of those 80s country-house hotels in miniature, only without the bedrooms. There is a pretty, sunlit dining room upfront with a completely over-the-top rococo ceiling, and out back is a woodlined snug of a 'library' for the taking of after dinner drinks and cigars. That said, the dinner service, which is yet to start, is clearly only a part of the deal. Collingbourne Ducis is designed as an all-day affair: home-made muffins and Irish porridge oats at breakfast, croissants and pastries at morning coffee, salads and sandwiches at lunchtime, scones and cakes and cream and jam at tea, leaving just enough time for Welsh rarebit and kedgeree for high tea. I can't help but feel a warm surge of affection for a place that resurrects high tea, complete with Welsh rarebit and kedgeree. I went there for lunch on a rainy summer's day when the dining room, with space for only a couple of dozen, was still comfortably unencumbered by anybody else resembling a customer.

      "body": "<p>As an uneasy adolescent growing up in Cornwall, Ken Lukowiak had a friend called Bob who had once been in the Parachute Regiment. His red beret hung on a hook in his bedroom and to Ken, the son of Jehovah's Witnesses, desperate for escape, it was everything. He determined to join the Paras. 'If it was manhood I was looking for,' he would later say, 'they were the ones for me. They were the \u00e9lite.' In 1979, aged 20, he finally did join the army. And, as he had hoped, it changed his life, but not in the way he expected. He became a writer. </p> <p>He made his name almost a decade after his discharge from the army, with his first book, A Soldier's Song, published in 1993. It's an unflinching portrait of what it was like to fight in the Falklands War. In raw and staccato language he described the smell of the Argentinian dead and the callous disregard for their sanctity of British troops. He described the crush of noise from jets overhead so loud it would leave him with a fear of sharp noises that endures to this day. And he described, with great compassion, the men who wept their way through windswept nights under fire at Goose Green. 'We could do with fewer artistic visionaries from imaginary worlds and a few more like Lukowiak,' announced Literary Review upon its publication. </p> <p>Now he has published his second book, Marijuana Time, and once again it draws on his military life. It is the story of what happened immediately after the events of A Soldier's Song, when he was posted to Belize. He travelled the country, met the people and, as the title suggests, bought enormous amounts of high-grade grass off them. Eventually he became involved in a drug-smuggling operation which led to a great fall, the break-up of his marriage and a spell in prison. </p> <p>'When I was first seeing publishers about A Soldier's Song ,' he says now, 'I had this fear that because I'd done dope smuggling and gone to prison they wouldn't want the book. I was ashamed of it, frankly.' When he told them his dirty secret he discovered it was his problem and nobody else's. 'These people didn't care. They didn't care at all.' </p> <p>Lukowiak had discovered his Unique Selling Point: he was a man who had done things - not because some editor had sent him out to do them in the name of reportage, but because that just happened to be the way his life had panned out. And now he could write about it all. </p> <p> Marijuana Time is unlikely to have the kick of A Soldier's Song ; few books could. Nevertheless it is an engaging read told in the authentic voice of the ex-Para. It tells an intriguing story: of the man conditioned by British Army training to believe he could manage any situation, who instead got so far out of his depth he could barely see the surface let alone gulp down air. </p> <p>I first met Lukowiak in the mid-Nineties when he came to write freelance features for a Sunday newspaper supplement where I was also working. Back then we called him Combat Kenny and sent him off to war. What else do you do with a writer who was once a paratrooper, with time in Northern Ireland and the Falklands under his belt? It seemed to make sense. </p> <p>'We were sending someone with combat experience to describe combat,' says a former editor of that supplement. He went to Bosnia for us three times and managed to get in to the Croat-controlled west side of Mostar when no other journalists were there. He reported the darkness of Rwanda twice and went to Argentina to confront the ghosts of the war he had fought against its people and was almost lynched for his efforts.' </p> <p>In retrospect it seems odd, this appetite for conflict. A Soldier's Song had been a very visceral and clear-eyed argument against war. And yet, when his writing had secured him a release from the post-army life of the ex-squaddie, he went back into battle. 'I'm Ken, the ex-fucking Para,' he says simply, over a beer (always over a beer; he could drink us soft-bellied hacks under the table any day). 'War is what people wanted me to do so to get work I had to go. On the one hand I hated it but on the other it kept me hanging in there as a writer.' For Lukowiak, staying in the writing game is now what it's all about. </p> <p>The new book is dedicated to Jill Tweedie, the great feminist writer and journalist, who died of motor neurone disease in 1993 and who, with her husband Alan Brien, was responsible for getting A Soldier's Song published in the first place. Lukowiak met them in the early Nineties when, after a miserable stretch on the dole, he had started making his living as a decorator and was sent to paint their house. </p> <p>Although he didn't know who Tweedie was, he did know she made her living as a writer. He decided to show her the first part of what eventually became his Falklands book. She in turn sent the manuscript to friends at the Guardian, who decided to publish it, all 15,000 words. 'I knew from the moment I received that first cheque from the Guardian that I never wanted to work again.' </p> <p>Today Lukowiak knows there are a lot of people in the media and literary circles in which Tweedie moved who mutter darkly about the dynamic of his relationship with her. They will accuse him of using her memory for his gain or of overplaying the strength of their relationship. They will say that, in her last months, he took up too much of her time, stole her away and isolated her from her friends. 'Fuck 'em,' he says, at first. 'I've got nothing else to say.' </p> <p>But then it turns out he has much more to say. He keeps returning to the subject, niggling away at it even when it seems he is done. It drives him crazy, this rumour and innuendo. 'I always felt the reason I met Jill was not so she could get me published but so I could be there for her at the end,' he says. 'I was the one who could carry her.' Later he says: 'Anyway, I'd already been published by then so I didn't need to hang around.' And he comes back to it once more; changes the subject from dope and Belize and stretches in prison in an attempt to set the record straight: 'I just adored her. I loved her in a way I've never loved another woman in my life, though it wasn't sexual.' </p> <p>So why the bitching? 'I don't know. When Jill was very ill I answered the phone a lot and nobody got to speak to Jill unless they went through me or Alan. A lot of the time she wasn't able to speak and I'd say that. And they - I call them the Hampstead crowd - it was almost as if they blamed me. That the only reason they couldn't talk to her was because of me.' Finally he says: 'She gave me a soul. By the time she met me I was a piece of human shit. My soul had gone. And I felt that if this woman could love me there had to be some good in me.' </p> <p>Did you buy dope for her? 'I grew the gear for her. We had a whole bunch of plants. Big buggers they were. She was never a regular smoker but once she became ill she smoked more, a couple of joints a day maybe. The doctors were even suggesting it. Try a bit of that, they'd say. And it was nice to grow it for her because I wasn't contaminating her with any criminality because I didn't have to go out and score.' </p> <p>And do you still smoke? He smiles. 'Every day,' he says. 'In all honesty I don't really know where I am with it. It doesn't even get me stoned any more. My girlfriend would tell you I need it, and maybe she's right. The people who say marijuana isn't addictive are talking bollocks. But then again maybe I've got an addictive personality.' He says that normally, when he sleeps, he does not dream. 'If I do stop smoking then I start dreaming again.' That, it is clear, is a Very Bad Thing. Lukowiak does not want to dream. He has far too much to dream about. </p> <p>The curious thing is that he comes across in the book as a truly terrible dope smoker, prone to awful bouts of paranoia. He is forever regretting the weed just purchased, and the last joint smoked. 'Maybe a military environment is not the best one to be getting stoned in.' Too many large men carrying guns. Too many tanks. 'That's the thing about this book,' he says. 'Dope smokers will like it but so will Jack Straw. It's not a positive book about drugs. It's a very dark book. I end up in a very dark place.' It is, he says, the same as A Soldier's Song. 'Mad squaddies loved it and so did the anti-war lobby. It cut both ways.' </p> <p>He says that everything he does now is in the service of A Soldier's Song ; it is the one piece of work that matters. 'I'll probably never write that well again because I'll probably never feel that much again.' That said there are limits to what he will do in its memory. He intends never to return to a war zone. He lives in Cornwall now, away from the noise and riot of London. He's 41 and he wants a little peace. </p> <p>'I remember the first night I was in Bosnia I was in a flat and there was fighting going on outside. I was pacing up and down and wondering what I was doing there. This war had nothing to do with me and yet I was there. The truth is I have no wish to be really scared again.' </p> <p>Whether he will truly be able to disengage though, is another question. He can be prone to acts of sweeping emotion. On returning from one trip to Bosnia, for example, he discovered that his then girlfriend, Sarah Macaulay, had started a relationship in his absence with a Labour politician called Gordon Brown. He used his key to her flat to let himself in and, finding a pile of men's suits, doused them with a pot of emulsion paint. It turned out the suits did not belong to the Chancellor-in-waiting but to Sarah's brother. 'People always overplayed that story,' Ken says now. 'They said it was gloss paint. Emulsion's a very different thing. I should know, I've been a decorator.' </p> <p>Two years ago he spent a few weeks at the Edinburgh Festival where a stage adaptation of A Soldier's Song was being performed and even there, amid the face painters and jugglers and endless productions of Berkoff, he managed to fight a mini-war all of his own. He identified a performer in a production about Bosnia as a former officer in the murderous Bosnian Croat militia and, through appearances on television and in print, managed to chase him out of the country. Anybody who met Lukowiak in Edinburgh's bars that week would have found a man raging with incandescent fury; there is something intimidating about an angry man when you know he has fought in wars. </p> <p>He smiles at the memory. 'One of the tools I have - a weapon in my writer's armoury - is my honesty,' he says. 'I just have to be honest. That's what made my name, the honesty of A Soldier's Song .' So that's what he does, whether in Bosnia or a wine bar in Edinburgh: he carries on being honest. 'Anything I do writing-wise is always about how I feel. That's my thing.' </p> <p>The problem is he may be running out of material to have feelings about. He accepts that there have been two parts to his life, the experiences and the writing about them. But now the experience bank is all but empty. He has a contract to write another book, a collection of his journalism expanded to fill a volume and that, he says is enough to keep him in the game for a couple more years. Then he will have to find something else to write about. And that means only one thing: Lukowiak, the reluctant war reporter, will have to have more adventures. It's what he does. </p> <p>\u0095 Marijuana Time by Ken Lukowiak is published by Orion, price \u00a39.99.</p>",

He can be prone to acts of sweeping emotion. On returning from one trip to Bosnia, for example, he discovered that his then girlfriend, Sarah Macaulay, had started a relationship in his absence with a Labour politician called Gordon Brown. He used his key to her flat to let himself in and, finding a pile of men's suits, doused them with a pot of emulsion paint. It turned out the suits did not belong to the Chancellor-in-waiting but to Sarah's brother. 'People always overplayed that story,' Ken says now. 'They said it was gloss paint. Emulsion's a very different thing. I should know, I've been a decorator.' Two years ago he spent a few weeks at the Edinburgh Festival where a stage adaptation of A Soldier's Song was being performed and even there, amid the face painters and jugglers and endless productions of Berkoff, he managed to fight a mini-war all of his own. He identified a performer in a production about Bosnia as a former officer in the murderous Bosnian Croat militia and, through appearances on television and in print, managed to chase him out of the country. Anybody who met Lukowiak in Edinburgh's bars that week would have found a man raging with incandescent fury; there is something intimidating about an angry man when you know he has fought in wars. He smiles at the memory. 'One of the tools I have - a weapon in my writer's armoury - is my honesty,' he says. 'I just have to be honest. That's what made my name, the honesty of A Soldier's Song .' So that's what he does, whether in Bosnia or a wine bar in Edinburgh: he carries on being honest. 'Anything I do writing-wise is always about how I feel. That's my thing.' The problem is he may be running out of material to have feelings about. He accepts that there have been two parts to his life, the experiences and the writing about them. But now the experience bank is all but empty. He has a contract to write another book, a collection of his journalism expanded to fill a volume and that, he says is enough to keep him in the game for a couple more years. Then he will have to find something else to write about. And that means only one thing: Lukowiak, the reluctant war reporter, will have to have more adventures. It's what he does. \u0095 Marijuana Time by Ken Lukowiak is published by Orion, price \u00a39.99.",

      "body": "<p>Last year at the Chelsea Flower Show there was a garden by James Alexander-Sinclair that he described as a 'tame-flower meadow'. Among other elements, it used the pheasant grass Stipa arundinacea, with biennials and herbaceous perennials poking up through it. This compressed the effect of a meadow with flowers rising up above the soft heads of grass. I liked it very much, especially as Sarah had been rethinking the use of grasses in our jewel garden. Any such planting is not remotely like a real meadow, of course, any more than tropical plants in the garden are like a 'real' jungle. Gardens are not for that. If you want to see nature at its most naturalistic, simply ignore your garden altogether and let it get along without you. </p> <p>We wanted to add the lightness of touch that grasses give to a border. Also, our jewel garden looks best in the low, slanting light of evening, and grasses pick up that light almost better than any other plant, holding it in the flowerheads and panicles like gentle torches. A real meadow depends on soil with low enough fertility to discourage the grass and encourage the flowers to flower fast, so they can produce seed before running out of nutrients or water. </p> <p>Too much fertility is always the element that ruins an amateur gardener's wildflower aspirations. Our borders are fat with fertility. The soil breeds itself like a yeast. This is good for raising vegetables, flowers or Herefordshire cattle, but not at all right for a wildflower meadow, which would turn into lush grass in a couple of years. But make a parody of that inside the literal framework of a border and you can get the best of both worlds, with the fullness of a perennial border and the lightness and airiness of an unsprayed hayfield in June. The grasses add veils and layers and constantly move, transcending the slightly stuffy heaviness that a mixed border can arrive at in mid- and late summer. </p> <p>Last year we planted Stipa giganteas in midsummer and they have grown this year to stupendous, majestic plants. We also had some Deschampsia flexuosa, which looked especially good interplanted with Cosmos atrosanguineus, and the combination kept going right into November. The success of the grasses we had meant we ordered a whole load of them. They were planted last autumn and we can now start to evaluate their effect, although a few will take a couple of years to get established. </p> <p>We bought the Stipa arundinacea that James Alexander-Sinclair used and, at the moment, it is still modest, not yet in flower and has only a touch of the rusty fringes that make it such a good autumnal grass. We also have quite a few more Stipa gigantea. These must be planted to catch the evening light, as the flower heads will catch the low sunlight and glow like slow-motion sparklers. The initial plant only develops its flower spike in the second season, but if you plant in the autumn it will work next summer. Stipa gigantea are prone to being bashed by the wind and difficult to support, so they should not be in an exposed spot. It is difficult to know whether to plant them in a relatively open position - to enjoy their leaves as well as the extraordinary leaping tracer of flower - or to have them appearing out of a welter of flower at their base. Both look good. </p> <p>One thinks of grasses as fundamentally green, but both these stipas rely on gold or russet, and if you look at any summer meadow it is hardly green at all - more fawn. It means the green foliage of your flowers does not disappear into the grassiness but works with and against it. I have to admit that this is all pathetically well tried and tested, but I am gleefully enjoying the change it brings to our borders. </p> <p>I remember doing a bit on grasses on a TV programme, and when I produced the brown sedge Carex comans 'Bronze Form', I would not have inspired more instant revulsion if I had casually held up a dead rat to the camera. But I love it. Any sense of deadness is belied by its obvious vigour: it spills out of itself like a demented pekinese and if given half-decent drainage needs no attention and lasts nearly all year round. </p> <p>Add to that Carex buchananii, which is similar but has charming wiggly bits at the ends of its leaves, and Carex flagellifera is a really useful extra foil for the border which works well with glaucous leaves such as cardoons, thalictrums, melianthus, macleayas and onopordums as well as lyme grass (Leymus arenarius) and the steely blue of Festuca glauca . By no means all the carex are brown - we have a variegated one called Carex hachijoensis 'Evergold' which has a pale golden stripe down its leaf. </p> <p>The brown carex looks dry to the touch. As a contrast this is fine but the incredible tactility of some of the grasses comes as a welcome relief. Deschampsia flexuosa is called 'wavy-hair grass', as much for the way that it feels as for its looks, and we have some near enough to the edge to ruffle as you pass. But the most sensually tactile of all is Stipa tenuissima (sometimes labelled Stipa tenuifolia). If you plant it in groups of about five the upright clumps are like the finest, softest handfuls of hair. </p> <p> Imperata cylindrica ' Rubra' is a mouthful of a name that rather solemnly describes one of the best grasses of all for a mixed border. When it does get going the tips of the leaves are flushed with a blood red. This spreads down the whole leaf as summer progresses, providing a fantastic foil for yellows, blues and surrounding greens. It loves our rich, rather damp soil and prefers not to be in full sun. </p> <p>We have put in various miscanthuses to get height and volume, including M sinensis strictus, which has horizontal yellow bands. M malpartus has plum-pink flowers and M sinensis 'Silberfeder' has silver-pink ones. Miscanthus nepalensis produces rich, tawny gold plumes 'which can only be described as delicate strands of gold thread' according to Hopecroft Plants' catalogue. We have no plumes yet to report. </p> <p>I have a tray of Melica altissima 'Atropurpurea' to be planted out. I've never grown this before but Sarah assures me they have deep purply brown panicles with black seeds, and she knows about these things. Among all these grasses the Knautia macedonica looks fantastic and Ligularia przewalskii is an ideal accompaniment. In fact any spikes or spires of flower look good in this tame-flower set up. The delphiniums, when they were in flower, looked just right as do the hollyhocks, inulas, heleniums and echinacea - as well as the gentler sprawlings of the Geranium 'Anne Folkhard', sprawling Clematis viticella and even the roses. It all sings.</p> <p> <strong>My roots</strong></p> <p>The rain has given the snails a second wind and they have wiped out my first planting of French beans and are doing their best to eat through the third wave of lettuces before they get big enough for us. I cut comfrey to seduce them and perhaps it works, but I never know how you measure the success of these things. </p> <p>The potatoes got blight at the end of the first week of July. I cut the tops off and used the flame thrower to burn off the haulms and kill the fungal spores. Potato blight indicates a turning point in the year. By the beginning of July the vegetable garden is becoming rich and full, the borders are sliding into sumptuousness and a fat softness takes over. Then it seems to become dissolute almost overnight: the potatoes are hacked back, the hedges are cut, delphiniums cut back and roses over. What is left is sharper, harder, experienced.</p> <p>It is not worse, but it is certainly something else. One of the areas of the garden that is affected most dramatically is the herb garden, which looks positively tatty if it is not cropped right back by now. It comes again, but looks like a fleeced sheep for a few weeks.</p> <p>For my birthday the other day, my son Adam gave me Smiling in Slow Motion by Derek Jarman - my favourite garden writer. Derek Jarman's Garden is my favourite gardening book: Howard Sooley's photographs seem so in tune with the subject and it transcends the bleedin' obvious that dogs so much of what is written about gardening.</p> <p>Jarman's sexuality and illness (he died of Aids in February 1994) are central to the book, but the garden on the beach at Dungeness runs through it like a flowering thread. Gardens are enriched beyond all horticulture by the lives that pass through them. What do they know of gardens who only gardens know?</p> <p>I am ashamed to say I have never been to see Prospect Cottage - nothing has stopped me except indolence. I wonder how it is now that Jarman has been dead these six years. Gardens move cruelly on, as indifferent to human sentiment as a crow alighting on an injured lamb. I finished the book terribly sad that we have lost a thoroughly good and heroic human being, and angry at the bigotry and hypocrisy that still demeans our society. But, above all, it makes me glad to be a gardener. So, inarticulate and very moved, I went into the garden and picked a bunch of flowers for Derek Jarman.</p> <p><strong>Your roots</strong></p> <p>Grasses often look spectacular throughout the winter. For this reason and for the health of the plant, leave the old leaves on until spring and cut them back in April when you see new growth. </p> <p>Miscanthus need dividing and moving after about five years, to encourage them to retain their vigour. It is important that the divided sections should be growing vigorously as soon as they are planted, so moving or dividing grasses should be done in spring or early summer rather than autumn.

The answer is that they have been accused of misrepresenting or misappropriating British achievement or the British character and should thus be banned. </p> <p>Winston Churchill attempted unsuccessfully to suppress Colonel Blimp in 1943 and two journalists, E.W. and M.M. Robson, published a pamphlet charging that Powell and Pressburger's film featured 'a rabid anti-Englishness almost pathological in its intensity'. Objective Burma, which concentrated on a US commando raid and ignored Slim's 14th Army, was withdrawn through press pressure before its West End opening in 1945 and not released until 1952. Sword in the Desert (1949), a Hollywood film suggesting that British troops stationed in Palestine may have acted brutally towards illegal Jewish immigrants, was taken off after three days in the West End following demonstrations and a bomb scare engendered by press attacks; it has never been revived. The prosecution cases against the more recent films are familiar.</p> <p>For Fleet Street to criticise the film industry for peddling lies and distortions is rather like the Niagara Falls attacking a garden hose for wasting water. This campaign against the movies has little to do with a genuine interest in history, the cinema or the pursuit of truth. It suggests to me the hypocrisy of newspapers, the dishonesty of journalists, the disingenuousness of scholars and the populist blathering of politicians. Everyone is looking for an angle, a source of righteous indignation, a way of avoiding rational argument. </p> <p>How could you settle down to a calm discussion about the handling of the American War of Independence with an Evening Standard critic who can write: 'It might be a lesson if visiting US stars like Mel Gibson were in future detained for a moment or two at points of entry and asked why their presence should be considered to be in the public interest. Those who rape women run into immigration trouble. Why not those who rape British history?'</p> <p>How can you respect a columnist writing on history and cinema for the Times when his own proprietor put Henry Ford's 'History is bunk' into the shade by dismissing the cautions of Lord Dacre, the distinguished historian Hugh Trevor-Roper, over the Hitler diaries, with a splenetic: 'Fuck Dacre.'</p> <p>As for historians, in last Wednesday's Guardian, Francis Wheen showed how ready they were, in writing pieces on the occasion of the Queen Mother's 100th birthday celebrations, to airbrush out any embarrassing details about her political acts and opinions. As Wheen demonstrated, Andrew Roberts's article in the Daily Telegraph said precisely the opposite of what he wrote in his book, Eminent Churchillians. </p> <p>And can you take Culture Secretary Chris Smith seriously when he says in the House something to the effect that he'll be keeping an eye on films like U-571 that appropriate British history? About as seriously, I'd say, as sensible folk took the ridiculous Duke of Windsor when, as Edward VIII, he visited the depressed south Wales coalfields and said that something should be done about it.</p> <p>I'm not here to defend Hollywood's treatment of history. I think people who rely on the movies for their knowledge of the past deserve all they get. I've been a sceptic since the day I got a detention at the age of 13 after arguing with a schoolmaster over whether Disraeli financed the Suez Canal or merely bought shares after de Lesseps built it. My evidence was based on having seen the movie Suez. </p> <p>On the other hand, that admirable novelist George MacDonald Fraser writes in The Hollywood History of the World: 'There is a popular belief that where history is concerned, Hollywood always gets it wrong - and sometimes it does. What is overlooked is the astonishing amount of history Hollywood has got right, and the immense, unacknowledged debt we owe to the commercial cinema as an illuminator of the story of mankind.'</p> <p>There is something rather sickening in the way cultural condescension and an unacknowledged Americanophobia bring the Left and Right together to attack Hollywood. In his Times essay on U-571 and The Patriot, the ultra-conservative Michael Gove moves into a general assault on Tinseltown, accusing American cinema of being the font of global cultural pollution. </p> <p>Meanwhile, over at the New Statesman, the left-wing Andrew Stephen moves on from The Patriot to an attack on ordinary Americans who appeared to be enjoying 'this nasty, $70m slash-trash' in the Washington cinema where he saw it. This encouraged him to a furious assault on anti-British prejudice in the States, American education and Hollywood. </p> <p>His prejudice is partly fuelled by ignorance, as evinced in his claim that the unjust treatment of Indians 'is a verboten subject, both in American schools and in Hollywood studios'. Has he never come across the 1950 Broken Arrow and the 1993 Geronimo, or a hundred movies in between, among them the Oscar-winning Dances with Wolves, which American neo-conservatives attacked as being hostile to paleface society? Incidentally, Stephen uses the word 'verboten' because Roland Emmerich, the director of The Patriot, is German. A touch of Basil Fawlty here. </p> <p>Behind these reactions, in addition to the indulgence of righteous indignation I've mentioned, is an absurd post-imperial sensitivity on the part of a country that was for too long feared, flattered, and fawned over. In 1940, Harry Watt and Humphrey Jennings collaborated on a documentary about the Blitz, shown in America as London Can Take It and at home as Britain Can Take It. </p> <p>The commentary, delivered by American journalist Quentin Reynolds, said, referring to the falling bombs: 'Those are not Hollywood sound effects.' Sixty years later, in this first year of a new century, it would seem that what the British can't take are those Hollywood sound effects.</p>",

Sword in the Desert (1949), a Hollywood film suggesting that British troops stationed in Palestine may have acted brutally towards illegal Jewish immigrants, was taken off after three days in the West End following demonstrations and a bomb scare engendered by press attacks; it has never been revived. The prosecution cases against the more recent films are familiar. For Fleet Street to criticise the film industry for peddling lies and distortions is rather like the Niagara Falls attacking a garden hose for wasting water. This campaign against the movies has little to do with a genuine interest in history, the cinema or the pursuit of truth. It suggests to me the hypocrisy of newspapers, the dishonesty of journalists, the disingenuousness of scholars and the populist blathering of politicians. Everyone is looking for an angle, a source of righteous indignation, a way of avoiding rational argument. How could you settle down to a calm discussion about the handling of the American War of Independence with an Evening Standard critic who can write: 'It might be a lesson if visiting US stars like Mel Gibson were in future detained for a moment or two at points of entry and asked why their presence should be considered to be in the public interest. Those who rape women run into immigration trouble. Why not those who rape British history?' How can you respect a columnist writing on history and cinema for the Times when his own proprietor put Henry Ford's 'History is bunk' into the shade by dismissing the cautions of Lord Dacre, the distinguished historian Hugh Trevor-Roper, over the Hitler diaries, with a splenetic: 'Fuck Dacre.' As for historians, in last Wednesday's Guardian, Francis Wheen showed how ready they were, in writing pieces on the occasion of the Queen Mother's 100th birthday celebrations, to airbrush out any embarrassing details about her political acts and opinions. As Wheen demonstrated, Andrew Roberts's article in the Daily Telegraph said precisely the opposite of what he wrote in his book, Eminent Churchillians. And can you take Culture Secretary Chris Smith seriously when he says in the House something to the effect that he'll be keeping an eye on films like U-571 that appropriate British history? About as seriously, I'd say, as sensible folk took the ridiculous Duke of Windsor when, as Edward VIII, he visited the depressed south Wales coalfields and said that something should be done about it. I'm not here to defend Hollywood's treatment of history. I think people who rely on the movies for their knowledge of the past deserve all they get. I've been a sceptic since the day I got a detention at the age of 13 after arguing with a schoolmaster over whether Disraeli financed the Suez Canal or merely bought shares after de Lesseps built it. My evidence was based on having seen the movie Suez. On the other hand, that admirable novelist George MacDonald Fraser writes in The Hollywood History of the World: 'There is a popular belief that where history is concerned, Hollywood always gets it wrong - and sometimes it does. What is overlooked is the astonishing amount of history Hollywood has got right, and the immense, unacknowledged debt we owe to the commercial cinema as an illuminator of the story of mankind.' There is something rather sickening in the way cultural condescension and an unacknowledged Americanophobia bring the Left and Right together to attack Hollywood. In his Times essay on U-571 and The Patriot, the ultra-conservative Michael Gove moves into a general assault on Tinseltown, accusing American cinema of being the font of global cultural pollution. Meanwhile, over at the New Statesman, the left-wing Andrew Stephen moves on from The Patriot to an attack on ordinary Americans who appeared to be enjoying 'this nasty, $70m slash-trash' in the Washington cinema where he saw it. This encouraged him to a furious assault on anti-British prejudice in the States, American education and Hollywood. His prejudice is partly fuelled by ignorance, as evinced in his claim that the unjust treatment of Indians 'is a verboten subject, both in American schools and in Hollywood studios'. Has he never come across the 1950 Broken Arrow and the 1993 Geronimo, or a hundred movies in between, among them the Oscar-winning Dances with Wolves, which American neo-conservatives attacked as being hostile to paleface society? Incidentally, Stephen uses the word 'verboten' because Roland Emmerich, the director of The Patriot, is German. A touch of Basil Fawlty here. Behind these reactions, in addition to the indulgence of righteous indignation I've mentioned, is an absurd post-imperial sensitivity on the part of a country that was for too long feared, flattered, and fawned over. In 1940, Harry Watt and Humphrey Jennings collaborated on a documentary about the Blitz, shown in America as London Can Take It and at home as Britain Can Take It. The commentary, delivered by American journalist Quentin Reynolds, said, referring to the falling bombs: 'Those are not Hollywood sound effects.' Sixty years later, in this first year of a new century, it would seem that what the British can't take are those Hollywood sound effects.",

By all accounts, he was a demanding, aloof figure and anecdotes about his working process abound, but his personality and 50-year career have not excited great interest among cineastes or the public.</p> <p>There's only one book about him, a slim, rather scholarly work. The demanding, aloof Stanley Kubrick, however, who made only 13 feature films in 50 years, none more enduringly popular than the best-known Curtiz movies (and several not as good), has attracted an astonishing amount of attention. </p> <p>In the year before his death on 7 March last year at the age of 70, there were two large, unauthorised biographies. Since then there have been books by two of his literary collaborators and revised editions of the officially approved studies by the only film critics he took into his confidence - Michel Ciment in France and Alexander Walker in this country.</p> <p>What makes Kubrick fascinating is the intensity of his art and his personality which led him to exact extraordinary demands on himself and those around him. In 1960, after bruising encounters with egocentric actor-producers - Marlon Brando fired him from One-Eyed Jacks, Kirk Douglas humiliated him on Spartacus - Kubrick settled in Britain, but remaining intensely American to the last. </p> <p>He became a combination of Prospero, Howard Hughes and Harry Lime, an eccentric business genius with magical powers and a demonic charm. Living a mysterious, reclusive life, he had everybody else's phone number but never gave out his own.</p> <p>His lifelong passions (and during the postwar years his principal sources of income) were photography and chess, the first a matter of capturing the precise, fleeting moment, the second a deadly game involving anticipating how to act at crucial times in the future.</p> <p>Michael Herr, the author of Dispatches, was drawn into Kubrick's world in 1980, initially with the idea of writing a film on the Holocaust, or on Jung, or a version of Schnitzler's Dream Story. They ended up working together on Full Metal Jacket, Kubrick's penultimate picture, set in South Carolina and Vietnam, shot in East Anglia and London's Docklands. </p> <p>Like most people who met Kubrick and became the recipients of his marathon phone calls, Herr fell under his spell. But like the witnesses in Citizen Kane and The Bad and the Beautiful, he got over being dazzled by the charisma, and in his brief memoir Kubrick he tries to understand this complex artist. </p> <p>To Herr, Kubrick was both a social Darwinist and a liberal humanist, a combination of tight-fisted capitalist businessman and obsessive artist, a man who made 'art films with blockbuster pretensions'. Contrary to the usual view that Kubrick was a film-maker with no personal life, Herr claims 'it would be more correct to say that he had no professional life since everything he did... was utterly personal'. When you signed on with him (and he drew up tight contracts), you became involved in 'dragging massive blocks nights and weekends and holidays in order to build another one of Stanley's pyramids, and whether cheerful or resentful didn't matter that much to him, although he preferred cheerful'. </p> <p>Herr's insightful book concludes with a detailed defence of Kubrick's posthumously released film Eyes Wide Shut, with which I largely agree, and an attack on its co-screenwriter Frederic Raphael's memoir of working with Kubrick - Eyes Wide Open - which I think ill-advised. Kubrick's friends and admirers too readily gang up on those who break ranks and Kubrick should have known when he hired Raphael that he wasn't taking on the sort of modest, cinematically inxperienced writer he liked working with. </p> <p>I was thus amused, and surprised, to read in The Complete Kubrick that Stanley Donen, director of Singin' in the Rain and subject of a bizarre homage in A Clockwork Orange, was planning a film based on Eyes Wide Open starring Frederic Raphael as Kubrick and Tom Conti (Raphael's alter ego in The Glittering Prizes) as Raphael.

      "bodyText": "Kubrick Michael Herr Picador \u00a310, pp98 Buy it at BOL The Complete Kubrick David Hughes Virgin \u00a315.99, pp303 Buy it at BOL Stanley Kubrick, Director: a Visual Analysis Alexander Walker, Sybil Taylor and Ulrich Ruchti Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson \u00a325, pp376 Michael Curtiz directed more than 150 films in every genre, a fair number of them popular classics - The Sea Hawk, The Adventures of Robin Hood, Mildred Pierce and, most famously, Casablanca. By all accounts, he was a demanding, aloof figure and anecdotes about his working process abound, but his personality and 50-year career have not excited great interest among cineastes or the public. There's only one book about him, a slim, rather scholarly work. The demanding, aloof Stanley Kubrick, however, who made only 13 feature films in 50 years, none more enduringly popular than the best-known Curtiz movies (and several not as good), has attracted an astonishing amount of attention. In the year before his death on 7 March last year at the age of 70, there were two large, unauthorised biographies. Since then there have been books by two of his literary collaborators and revised editions of the officially approved studies by the only film critics he took into his confidence - Michel Ciment in France and Alexander Walker in this country. What makes Kubrick fascinating is the intensity of his art and his personality which led him to exact extraordinary demands on himself and those around him. In 1960, after bruising encounters with egocentric actor-producers - Marlon Brando fired him from One-Eyed Jacks, Kirk Douglas humiliated him on Spartacus - Kubrick settled in Britain, but remaining intensely American to the last. He became a combination of Prospero, Howard Hughes and Harry Lime, an eccentric business genius with magical powers and a demonic charm. Living a mysterious, reclusive life, he had everybody else's phone number but never gave out his own. His lifelong passions (and during the postwar years his principal sources of income) were photography and chess, the first a matter of capturing the precise, fleeting moment, the second a deadly game involving anticipating how to act at crucial times in the future. Michael Herr, the author of Dispatches, was drawn into Kubrick's world in 1980, initially with the idea of writing a film on the Holocaust, or on Jung, or a version of Schnitzler's Dream Story. They ended up working together on Full Metal Jacket, Kubrick's penultimate picture, set in South Carolina and Vietnam, shot in East Anglia and London's Docklands. Like most people who met Kubrick and became the recipients of his marathon phone calls, Herr fell under his spell. But like the witnesses in Citizen Kane and The Bad and the Beautiful, he got over being dazzled by the charisma, and in his brief memoir Kubrick he tries to understand this complex artist. To Herr, Kubrick was both a social Darwinist and a liberal humanist, a combination of tight-fisted capitalist businessman and obsessive artist, a man who made 'art films with blockbuster pretensions'. Contrary to the usual view that Kubrick was a film-maker with no personal life, Herr claims 'it would be more correct to say that he had no professional life since everything he did... was utterly personal'. When you signed on with him (and he drew up tight contracts), you became involved in 'dragging massive blocks nights and weekends and holidays in order to build another one of Stanley's pyramids, and whether cheerful or resentful didn't matter that much to him, although he preferred cheerful'. Herr's insightful book concludes with a detailed defence of Kubrick's posthumously released film Eyes Wide Shut, with which I largely agree, and an attack on its co-screenwriter Frederic Raphael's memoir of working with Kubrick - Eyes Wide Open - which I think ill-advised. Kubrick's friends and admirers too readily gang up on those who break ranks and Kubrick should have known when he hired Raphael that he wasn't taking on the sort of modest, cinematically inxperienced writer he liked working with. I was thus amused, and surprised, to read in The Complete Kubrick that Stanley Donen, director of Singin' in the Rain and subject of a bizarre homage in A Clockwork Orange, was planning a film based on Eyes Wide Open starring Frederic Raphael as Kubrick and Tom Conti (Raphael's alter ego in The Glittering Prizes) as Raphael. As John Wayne says in The Searchers: 'That'll be the day.' There is much stuff like this in David Hughes's The Complete Kubrick, a widely researched account of all the films (and the uncompleted projects), every line packed with accumulated facts, opinions and speculation on the sources, influences, making and impact of the films. The level of accuracy is high (the only obvious serious error is the claim that novelist Howard Fast, author of Spartacus, was one of the Hollywood 10) and the book is both fun to read and valuable for reference. But turning from The Complete Kubrick to Alexander Walker's Stanley Kubrick, Director, a book on which Hughes extensively draws for quotations and insights, is like exchanging an anorak for a thinking cap. First published in 1971 as Stanley Kubrick Directs, Walker's book has been re-designed by Sybil Taylor and Ulrich Ruchti and is among the best studies ever made of a director.

These illustrations truly illuminate the text. People in production stills strike attitudes; frame blow-ups make points.To his affectionate, but not uncritical text, Walker has added a 'personal postscript' that ends with a moving account of Kubrick's funeral. Both Ciment and Walker help us see what they think makes Kubrick's films special. They direct us to the results of his fastidiousness as they manifest themselves on screen - things that cannot be explained verbally. They have to be seen, experienced visually, to be understood. Provocatively, Herr claims that a sensitivity to language preceded the image for Kubrick, hence his reverence for Nabokov and Burgess.

      "body": "<p>The defeat of insurer Equitable Life in the House of Lords last week ended an 18-month legal battle over an obscure-sounding pension product. But the defeat, which has resulted in Equitable putting itself up for sale, has implications beyond holders of its Guaranteed Annuity Policies (GARs) and even beyond this company. </p> <p>Here is a guide for the firm's 450,000 customers: </p> <p> <strong> What went wrong and why?</strong> </p> <p> Equitable followed a fashion between 20 and 30 years ago by selling plans that guaranteed to pay investors a minimum income. </p> <p>Clients were promised pensions worth roughly 11 per cent of of their personal fund on retirement. But the returns available to Equitable in the financial market to pay the guarantees are around only a half to a third of this. </p> <p>It chose to reduce the customers' final bonuses payable on its with-profit pensions so that it would not have to foot the \u00a31.5 billion bill for honouring the guarantees. Pensioners were left with incomes lower than the insurer had promised. </p> <p>After a flood of complaints the insurer mounted a legal case to resolve the argument. </p> <p> <strong> Need it have happened?</strong> </p> <p> Yes and no. Equitable did not build up the level of reserves that other insurers did over the years. It believed it should pay the maximum returns to policyholders as it went along, and not hoard money. </p> <p>The firm also paid generous early surrender values to policyholder during years when rivals were paying derisory amounts, says Ned Cazalet, of Cazalet Financing Consulting. </p> <p>This philosophy earned Equitable accolades and places in best-buy tables, but left it exposed when interest rates - the deciding factor in setting annuities - fell much lower than expected. </p> <p>Cazalet says Equitable also suffered from an unforeseen increase in life expectancy, which has raised the cost of honouring the guarantees. </p> <p>Equitable might be forgiven for having failed to predict these developments, but industry observers believe the firm's handling of the row over the annuities has been poor. It chose to fight an long battle rather than face the problem when it arose. Equitable's sales have fallen during the row; leading financial advisers have been reluctant to recommend it because of the uncertainty. </p> <p> <strong> What other Equitable investments are affected?</strong> </p> <p> Anything that is also invested in Equitable's with-profits fund. The insurer is taking an estimated \u00a31.5bn from elsewhere - a final figure will be confirmed on Wednesday - and transferring it to the 100,000 people with GARs. As a mutual it has nowhere else to get the money. </p> <p>The result is that returns on products such as mortgage endowments and savings schemes will fall. Nigel Webb of Equitable says: 'To put that back is one reason we are seeking a buyer.' </p> <p>Investors with unit-linked, and other non with-profits investments will not be affected directly. There must be a question mark, though, over the effect of the uncertainty on the morale, and the results, of investment managers at Equitable. </p> <p> <strong> Is my mortgage less likely to be paid off?</strong> </p> <p> Equitable claims that all its mortgages were on course to be repaid anyway, and the \u00a31.5bn transfer should not have a significant affect. </p> <p> <strong> Do I need to take action?</strong> </p> <p> Advisers are urging investors to sit tight, pointing out that a rash of policy surrenders might rebound by worsening the firm's plight. </p> <p>Robert Guy, of John Charcol says: 'We believe the insurer will be an attractive buy, given the value of its customers to any potential partner. They simply need the financial support.' </p> <p>Martyn Laverick, at Chartwell Investment Management, says people contributing to Equitable pensions will have to decide whether it is worth continuing to do so, or possibly to transfer their fund elsewhere. But this decision should not be made until the insurer's future is clearer. </p> <p>Charges on Equitable policies are low and its existing penalties reasonable, so those who leave should not face heavy transfer fees. But he stresses that investors should not move quickly. 'There are stakeholder pensions and other issues to look at,' says Laverick. </p> <p>He points out that Equitable also has with profit bonds but, again, investors should not rush to surrender. </p> <p>Jason Hollands, at Best Investment, recommends that investors should wait 18 months to decide what to do, by which time they may also have received a windfall from the sale of the insurer. </p> <p> <strong> I have a guaranteed policy. What do I do now?</strong> </p> <p> You and the 99,000 other people with these policies are the clear winners from this sad fiasco. Around 27,000 people with these types of policies have reached retirement age. They should now contact their independent adviser or Equitable sales rep. Others with such policies should hang on to them. </p> <p>Stuart Bayliss, of independent adviser Annuity Direct, who has championed the cause of the Equitable pensioners, says there are a number of outstanding questions for holders of some guaranteed policies. Some people have already used their guaranteed policies to buy annuities elsewhere, and there is a question mark over whether they will be compensated. </p> <p>Equitable says it will give details in three weeks' time of a review to resolve the position of these policyholders and of those who have died. The review will be overseen by an independent actuary. </p> <p> <strong> Do other insurers have the same problem?</strong> </p> <p> Several do, including such big names as Standard Life, CGNU (the combined Norwich Union and Commercial Union) and Scottish Widows. Most agreed to pay the guarantees, and Ned Cazalet estimates that the total cost of this to the industry is around \u00a310bn .

      "bodyText": "The defeat of insurer Equitable Life in the House of Lords last week ended an 18-month legal battle over an obscure-sounding pension product. But the defeat, which has resulted in Equitable putting itself up for sale, has implications beyond holders of its Guaranteed Annuity Policies (GARs) and even beyond this company. Here is a guide for the firm's 450,000 customers: What went wrong and why? Equitable followed a fashion between 20 and 30 years ago by selling plans that guaranteed to pay investors a minimum income. Clients were promised pensions worth roughly 11 per cent of of their personal fund on retirement. But the returns available to Equitable in the financial market to pay the guarantees are around only a half to a third of this. It chose to reduce the customers' final bonuses payable on its with-profit pensions so that it would not have to foot the \u00a31.5 billion bill for honouring the guarantees. Pensioners were left with incomes lower than the insurer had promised. After a flood of complaints the insurer mounted a legal case to resolve the argument. Need it have happened? Yes and no. Equitable did not build up the level of reserves that other insurers did over the years. It believed it should pay the maximum returns to policyholders as it went along, and not hoard money. The firm also paid generous early surrender values to policyholder during years when rivals were paying derisory amounts, says Ned Cazalet, of Cazalet Financing Consulting. This philosophy earned Equitable accolades and places in best-buy tables, but left it exposed when interest rates - the deciding factor in setting annuities - fell much lower than expected. Cazalet says Equitable also suffered from an unforeseen increase in life expectancy, which has raised the cost of honouring the guarantees. Equitable might be forgiven for having failed to predict these developments, but industry observers believe the firm's handling of the row over the annuities has been poor. It chose to fight an long battle rather than face the problem when it arose. Equitable's sales have fallen during the row; leading financial advisers have been reluctant to recommend it because of the uncertainty. What other Equitable investments are affected? Anything that is also invested in Equitable's with-profits fund. The insurer is taking an estimated \u00a31.5bn from elsewhere - a final figure will be confirmed on Wednesday - and transferring it to the 100,000 people with GARs. As a mutual it has nowhere else to get the money. The result is that returns on products such as mortgage endowments and savings schemes will fall. Nigel Webb of Equitable says: 'To put that back is one reason we are seeking a buyer.' Investors with unit-linked, and other non with-profits investments will not be affected directly. There must be a question mark, though, over the effect of the uncertainty on the morale, and the results, of investment managers at Equitable. Is my mortgage less likely to be paid off? Equitable claims that all its mortgages were on course to be repaid anyway, and the \u00a31.5bn transfer should not have a significant affect. Do I need to take action? Advisers are urging investors to sit tight, pointing out that a rash of policy surrenders might rebound by worsening the firm's plight. Robert Guy, of John Charcol says: 'We believe the insurer will be an attractive buy, given the value of its customers to any potential partner. They simply need the financial support.' Martyn Laverick, at Chartwell Investment Management, says people contributing to Equitable pensions will have to decide whether it is worth continuing to do so, or possibly to transfer their fund elsewhere. But this decision should not be made until the insurer's future is clearer. Charges on Equitable policies are low and its existing penalties reasonable, so those who leave should not face heavy transfer fees. But he stresses that investors should not move quickly. 'There are stakeholder pensions and other issues to look at,' says Laverick. He points out that Equitable also has with profit bonds but, again, investors should not rush to surrender. Jason Hollands, at Best Investment, recommends that investors should wait 18 months to decide what to do, by which time they may also have received a windfall from the sale of the insurer. I have a guaranteed policy. What do I do now? You and the 99,000 other people with these policies are the clear winners from this sad fiasco. Around 27,000 people with these types of policies have reached retirement age. They should now contact their independent adviser or Equitable sales rep. Others with such policies should hang on to them. Stuart Bayliss, of independent adviser Annuity Direct, who has championed the cause of the Equitable pensioners, says there are a number of outstanding questions for holders of some guaranteed policies. Some people have already used their guaranteed policies to buy annuities elsewhere, and there is a question mark over whether they will be compensated. Equitable says it will give details in three weeks' time of a review to resolve the position of these policyholders and of those who have died. The review will be overseen by an independent actuary. Do other insurers have the same problem? Several do, including such big names as Standard Life, CGNU (the combined Norwich Union and Commercial Union) and Scottish Widows. Most agreed to pay the guarantees, and Ned Cazalet estimates that the total cost of this to the industry is around \u00a310bn . Most have provided for the guarantees. One smaller insurer, MGM, has refused to pay the guaranteed pensions. It is taking legal advice following last week's judgment. There is speculation that it, too, will have to find a partner, although MGM claims it is stronger than Equitable. What will Equitable do now? It is seeking a buyer. Companies believed to be interested include the Prudential, CGNU and European insurance groups. Will I get a windfall? Probably, but don't expect too much after a buyer has underwritten the cost of funding the guarantees.",

      "body": "<p><strong> No Great Mischief</strong><br>Alistair MacLeod<br>Cape \u00a315.99, pp264</p> <p>This extraordinary novel, telling the story of the substantial branch of the MacDonald clan that settled on Cape Breton Island off Nova Scotia, offers every satisfaction except an ending as quietly mighty as what has gone before. At the end of the text, Alistair MacLeod acknowledges the 'spiritual assistance' that came his way during its completion, but from a reader's point of view the notes of reconciliation and transcendence in the closing pages license the sentimentality that has been suppressed so long and so well. </p> <p>No Great Mischief is not a historical novel, except in the sense that the MacDonalds see everything in terms of their ancestry. For them, Glencoe and Culloden occupy the historic present rather than the past tense. Even their Canadian forebears cast long shadows. The narrator's great-great-great-grandfather, Calum Ruadh or Calum the Red, left Scotland in 1779, but he is a constant presence in modern conversations. </p> <p>His genes display a staying power no less phenomenal, his descendants having hair that is either bright red or intensely black. Many of the redheads have very dark eyes, so that even experienced observers, such as the staff on a maternity ward, pronounce that a newborn's hair will turn dark or his eyes turn blue, on the basis that 'no one looks like that '. </p> <p>This is a clan with any number of casualties, but apparently no rebels. Marrying outside the gene pool is not so much a betrayal as a waste of effort, since Calum Ruadh's genes are not susceptible to dilution. The narrator's twin sister, having forgotten her Gaelic, married a man called Pankovich and moved to Calgary, might seem to have moved away from the clan's range.</p> <p>Then one day, her 11-year-old son returns baffled from a bike ride, having met a carful of travellers who asked him what his mother's maiden name was. When he said: 'MacDonald', he was given a $50 note, for the way he looked, as he was told - and what it represented. It speaks well for the clan's character that the money does not change hands within the car, to settle a bet, but is passed on to a relative who will never be seen again, with a cryptic Gaelic message for the boy's mother. </p> <p>The novel's title quotes General Wolfe, who had fought against the MacDonalds in an earlier conflict but relied on them to take the Plains of Abraham: 'They are hardy, intrepid, accustomed to a rough country, and no great mischief if they fall.' Wolfe regarded the Highlanders as his secret enemies, and was furious at their insistence on carrying their wounded from the field when ordered to retreat.

      "bodyText": "No Great Mischief Alistair MacLeod Cape \u00a315.99, pp264 This extraordinary novel, telling the story of the substantial branch of the MacDonald clan that settled on Cape Breton Island off Nova Scotia, offers every satisfaction except an ending as quietly mighty as what has gone before. At the end of the text, Alistair MacLeod acknowledges the 'spiritual assistance' that came his way during its completion, but from a reader's point of view the notes of reconciliation and transcendence in the closing pages license the sentimentality that has been suppressed so long and so well. No Great Mischief is not a historical novel, except in the sense that the MacDonalds see everything in terms of their ancestry. For them, Glencoe and Culloden occupy the historic present rather than the past tense. Even their Canadian forebears cast long shadows. The narrator's great-great-great-grandfather, Calum Ruadh or Calum the Red, left Scotland in 1779, but he is a constant presence in modern conversations. His genes display a staying power no less phenomenal, his descendants having hair that is either bright red or intensely black. Many of the redheads have very dark eyes, so that even experienced observers, such as the staff on a maternity ward, pronounce that a newborn's hair will turn dark or his eyes turn blue, on the basis that 'no one looks like that '. This is a clan with any number of casualties, but apparently no rebels. Marrying outside the gene pool is not so much a betrayal as a waste of effort, since Calum Ruadh's genes are not susceptible to dilution. The narrator's twin sister, having forgotten her Gaelic, married a man called Pankovich and moved to Calgary, might seem to have moved away from the clan's range. Then one day, her 11-year-old son returns baffled from a bike ride, having met a carful of travellers who asked him what his mother's maiden name was. When he said: 'MacDonald', he was given a $50 note, for the way he looked, as he was told - and what it represented. It speaks well for the clan's character that the money does not change hands within the car, to settle a bet, but is passed on to a relative who will never be seen again, with a cryptic Gaelic message for the boy's mother. The novel's title quotes General Wolfe, who had fought against the MacDonalds in an earlier conflict but relied on them to take the Plains of Abraham: 'They are hardy, intrepid, accustomed to a rough country, and no great mischief if they fall.' Wolfe regarded the Highlanders as his secret enemies, and was furious at their insistence on carrying their wounded from the field when ordered to retreat. Here in the public record are themes that the book explores more domestically: a self-sacrificial code of honour, and the betrayal that lies in wait for it. The narrator is three when his parents and brother Colin are drowned, betrayed by the treacherous ice of late March. He and his twin are taken in by their sweet-souled grandpa and grandma, an element of austerity in their upbringing being provided by their other grandfather, who keeps his tenderness better hidden. The older orphans, three boys more or less able to look after themselves, leave school and set up house away from town. The eldest boy, and the only one of the three to be named, is another Calum, just as the narrator is one Alexander MacDonald among many. The two names seem to alternate like the paradoxical colourings, the red and the dark. The resemblances between the two named brothers are strong, yet Alexander sees himself as some sort of traitor for having made a success of his life, when Calum went under. Alexander is an orthodontist, a choice of career made to seem more frivolous by an extraordinary scene in which Calum tries to extract an infected tooth from his own jaw with pliers while on a fishing trip, and then finishes the job with the superior traction of Christy, the mare the brothers use to pull their boat up the skidway. The animals in the story bear the same relationship to their masters as the MacDonalds do to the rest of humanity - they keep their side of the bargain. It's in the dogs, in particular, to care too much and try too hard. If the past is both a burden and a resource, though, the present is no more than a dead end. A certain effortfulness can be detected in the short, interleaved chapters detailing a visit by Alexander to broken-down Calum, living in a squalid room in Toronto.

Stephen Knight's book is an 'act of retrieval', an account of his Austrian-Welsh family looked at through the filter of fiction. He set out to write down the bedtime stories his father made up for him on their annual holidays in Austria, but instead discovered that the footnotes he felt compelled to include 'began to grow from the bottom of the page, rising up, until they became as important... as the tales themselves.' </p> <p>Like Nabokov's Pale Fire, Mr Schnitzel is a novel in which the real action occurs off-stage, or at least in the wings. What you get are fantastical, Munchhausenesque fairy stories about the Austrian navy - maidens, sailors, pirates and daring deeds on the high seas - running concurrently with peculiar and oddly touching anecdotes about the family. And what a family it is: a genial, oblivious father, a nearly insane, kleptomaniac mother and numerous unhinged aunts and uncles who endlessly serve up inedible meals. </p> <p>The footnote links are often surreal and tangential, reflecting the complex and impenetrable currents of connections that any family group can build up: in one story, the word 'sunlight' is footnoted with a recollection of how his comics became faded in the boot of the car, the figures 'bleached to a ghost'. In another, 'sailor's grave' is appended by the observation that 'death is almost as popular as skiing in Austria'. </p> <p>Reading a book in this way is more of a challenge than it seems. You can't decide whether to interrupt the fairytale to follow the footnote or read it through and then go back. I experimented with both, and the result is much the same - a layered, slightly blurred but curiously satisfying narrative. In revealing the real-life parallels and explanations for the father's tales, it manages to expose that alchemical process of how fact turns into fantasy and then into fiction. </p> <p>There are more exasperating and mystifying family members in <strong> Welcome to my Planet</strong>. Try not to be alarmed by the cover here. A virulent pastiche of old Hanna-Barbera cartoons in turquoise, yellow, orange and pink, it's a real car-crash of a book cover. And it doesn't seem to bear any relation to its contents.The author pre-empts any feeble attempts at drawing autobiographical comparisons: Minnesota graduate Shannon Olson's main character is a Minnesota student called Shannon Olson. I got a sinking feeling when, on the first page, she confides: 'I never thought I'd be single at 30.' </p> <p>But this is not one to file in the single white female fiction section; it's much more acidic and interesting than that. A permanent malcontent, Shannon has lost her way in life. She is doing a non-job in a nebulous branch of software testing, running up credit card bills and wondering why her life isn't more like the soap operas she grew up on. When she splits up with her boyfriend and decides to return to college, she moves back in with her parents. </p> <p>This is where the real verve and originality lies: this isn't a book about girls and boys, it's about girls and mothers, which is a subject that intrigues at least half of the population. Flo, the mother, does water aerobics, wears lipsticks that match her sweaters, has an unhealthy obsession with the recycling of leftovers and gives gentle but unwanted advice to her daughter such as: 'Maybe that blouse would look nice tucked in.' </p> <p>Then, suddenly, she is diagnosed with a brain tumour. Olson pulls off a great antithesis of style and content: the narrative is in short, anecdotal chunks like a stand-up routine but the subject matter it tackles is the pain, alienation and confusion inherent in modern life if you don't fit into a prescribed mould. Depression, she decides at one point, is 'the absolutely correct biological response to living in America'. She is also very, very funny, and doesn't pull her punches with the various men who cross her path. Look out for Michael, who metamorphoses from a heaven-sent male into a sinister, smiling detractor who 'always seems surprised when I get an A on something'.</p> <p>Gunnar Kopperud's <strong> The Time of Light</strong> is a visceral and often shocking dissection of the effects of war. It is 1994 in the Caucasus and Armenia is preparing for a war with Azerbaijan. An old man, Markus, cannot stop weeping at the sounds and smells of war which reach him through his windows. His neighbours summon a priest and Markus begins to tell him his story, unravelling his life. Markus is a German and fought in the Nazi invasion of Russia in the Second World War. So traumatised and scarred is he by the acts he has committed in the name of his country that he never returns to Germany, preferring instead to make his life in the country he once played a part in trying to destroy. </p> <p>Like Martin Amis's Time's Arrow, The Time of Light is asking for sympathy for the devil - a Nazi. The prose veers between the factual listing of historical dates and places, unflinching, blow-by-blow accounts of battles Markus and his companions were involved in and some indigestible passages of heavily symbolic magic realism. This is, at times, an impressive book. There is an incredible scene where disbelieving German PoWs are shown a film reel of the Nazi concentration camps: 'This is the truth about the ideology you went to war for,' they are told. </p> <p>Kopperud's actualities of war work better than his more abstract passages. But the problem is that to return to such well-documented ground you really need to be making a new point, and I'm not sure that Kopperud is.</p>",

A virulent pastiche of old Hanna-Barbera cartoons in turquoise, yellow, orange and pink, it's a real car-crash of a book cover. And it doesn't seem to bear any relation to its contents.The author pre-empts any feeble attempts at drawing autobiographical comparisons: Minnesota graduate Shannon Olson's main character is a Minnesota student called Shannon Olson. I got a sinking feeling when, on the first page, she confides: 'I never thought I'd be single at 30.' But this is not one to file in the single white female fiction section; it's much more acidic and interesting than that. A permanent malcontent, Shannon has lost her way in life. She is doing a non-job in a nebulous branch of software testing, running up credit card bills and wondering why her life isn't more like the soap operas she grew up on. When she splits up with her boyfriend and decides to return to college, she moves back in with her parents. This is where the real verve and originality lies: this isn't a book about girls and boys, it's about girls and mothers, which is a subject that intrigues at least half of the population. Flo, the mother, does water aerobics, wears lipsticks that match her sweaters, has an unhealthy obsession with the recycling of leftovers and gives gentle but unwanted advice to her daughter such as: 'Maybe that blouse would look nice tucked in.' Then, suddenly, she is diagnosed with a brain tumour. Olson pulls off a great antithesis of style and content: the narrative is in short, anecdotal chunks like a stand-up routine but the subject matter it tackles is the pain, alienation and confusion inherent in modern life if you don't fit into a prescribed mould. Depression, she decides at one point, is 'the absolutely correct biological response to living in America'. She is also very, very funny, and doesn't pull her punches with the various men who cross her path. Look out for Michael, who metamorphoses from a heaven-sent male into a sinister, smiling detractor who 'always seems surprised when I get an A on something'. Gunnar Kopperud's The Time of Light is a visceral and often shocking dissection of the effects of war. It is 1994 in the Caucasus and Armenia is preparing for a war with Azerbaijan. An old man, Markus, cannot stop weeping at the sounds and smells of war which reach him through his windows. His neighbours summon a priest and Markus begins to tell him his story, unravelling his life. Markus is a German and fought in the Nazi invasion of Russia in the Second World War. So traumatised and scarred is he by the acts he has committed in the name of his country that he never returns to Germany, preferring instead to make his life in the country he once played a part in trying to destroy. Like Martin Amis's Time's Arrow, The Time of Light is asking for sympathy for the devil - a Nazi. The prose veers between the factual listing of historical dates and places, unflinching, blow-by-blow accounts of battles Markus and his companions were involved in and some indigestible passages of heavily symbolic magic realism. This is, at times, an impressive book. There is an incredible scene where disbelieving German PoWs are shown a film reel of the Nazi concentration camps: 'This is the truth about the ideology you went to war for,' they are told. Kopperud's actualities of war work better than his more abstract passages. But the problem is that to return to such well-documented ground you really need to be making a new point, and I'm not sure that Kopperud is.",

But what then seemed a gentle satire on the bed-hopping betrayals of a post-promiscuous generation now looks like a comment on an entire kiss 'n' tell industry.

Oliver demands at one point, asking Stuart, Gillian - but more important we the jury - to deal with him a little more leniently.</p> <p>Barnes is the sharpest and most humane observer of the particular frailties of the average middle-class Englishman at the beginning of the twenty-first century. He is also the consummate deconstructor of the lies we all tell ourselves about romance. He attends sharp-eyed to the syntactical shifts wrought by habit: Gillian frets, for example, that familiarity has caused her to drop the 'I' from 'I love you' when she says it to Oliver each day: is the love it describes also losing its subject?

John Prescott is happy to remind anyone who asks that New Labour was never a phrase he used himself; he always knew it would turn out a wrong 'un. Gordon Brown, whose attachment to New Labour has ever been proportionate to its popularity, acts with characteristic comradeliness to distance himself from Tony Blair in whose flailings the Chancellor sniffs an opportunity to advertise his own solidity.</p> <p>The tocsin sounds most dolefully from within the innermost sanctum of the Blairite tabernacle. Thanks to a cascade of leaked memos we can all share the neurotic alarm at the very centre. Philip Gould, guru of the focus group and mid-wife to 'The Project', reports to the Prime Minister that the 'New Labour brand is badly contaminated'. What was going to bestride the millennium - 'a thousand days for a thousand years,' Blair once boasted - is shrivelling in ridicule and contempt after just half a dozen years. 'Something has gone seriously wrong,' Gould quotes a bewildered Peter Mandelson. 'But what is it?'</p> <p>To answer his question, begin with the strange circumstances of the birth. New Labour was the creation of a group so small that you can count it on one hand: Blair, Brown, Alastair Campbell, Mandelson, and Gould. That quintet is, essentially, about it. This was never a mass movement; more of a brilliant coup d'etat . The bargain between this power-hungry group and their office-starved party was that they would be given absolute command in return for winning office. Only by ruthlessly concentrating control within such a tight, if volatile, clique was it possible to radically overhaul a four-times losing party and turn into a fantastic vehicle for acquiring power. For that, its principle purpose, New Labour was a sensational triumph. And so it was - or at least appeared to be - for the first half of the Government's life.</p> <p>Paradoxically, one of the things that has gone wrong for New Labour is its success. It came into life as a negative. It was not the Conservatives, it was not Old Labour, and that was sufficient for the majority of voters who didn't want to return to either. That negative has been more than proved. The most flatulent criticism of Tony Blair was to call him a Tory with dental floss. The minimum wage, the New Deal, devolution: a Conservative Government would have done none of that. Nor would a Tory administration have committed itself to last week's announcement of an unprecedented investment in public services. As there would not have been under an Old Labour Government either, whose every turn in office was shipwrecked in economic calamity by this stage of the parliament.</p> <p>The first trouble is that the point is long passed when it was enough for New Labour to expect applause simply for not being something else. We've got that, been there, seen the film, acquired the T-shirt. New Labour - as is always the risk with products which market themselves on their novelty - is old news. Now the country asks a different question of Tony Blair, a question that always unnerves him and divides those around the leader. What is he for?</p> <p>WINNING. THAT is what New Labour has always been for. Towards the end of his first month in power, in May 1997, Tony Blair and Bill Clinton took a press conference in Number 10's ersatz rose garden. I asked Clinton what tips he might have to offer to his British younger cousin. Before the American could reply, Blair leant forward to speak for him: 'He got the most important thing right. He got re-elected.'</p> <p>There is nothing disreputable about a politician seeking to retain office. The obsession with securing the full second term which eluded every previous Labour government is not of itself a bad thing. Policies without the power to implement them are pointless. It is allowing the pursuit of the popular to consume everything else that is the canker. This has spread the cancerous impression that principle is always expedited into oblivion in the tossing about for populist quick-fixes.</p> <p>Popularity was elevated to such a pre-eminent place in the New Labourite creed because the modernisers never expected to be loved. It is in the nature of small and secretive groups to be paranoid. The emotionally-wracked nature of the relationships within the ruling set compounded their sense of insecurity. They have always worked on the assumption that they would only be tolerated so long as they were pop ular. This explains the great paradox of why a Prime Minister with such a pliant Cabinet and a massive thrall over parliament thrashes about as if he were a night away from being brought down by a no confidence motion. From this has flowed the often crippling obsession with every twitch of the opinion polls, every burp of a sample of swing voters assembled in a suburban sitting room, every harrumph of reactionary pundit or screech from a right-wing tabloid.</p> <p>Philip Gould is a man with a passionate commitment to the cause of his party. But his pessimistic belief that Britain is essentially a conservative country is combined with an over-exposure to the worst of American politics. He quotes approvingly from Dick Morris, the shaman who did dark voodoo for Bill Clinton. Dick's head theory is that 'politics has moved from representational democracy to direct democracy in which there is a need to win a daily mandate, in which strength comes from popularity'. This is getting things precisely the wrong way round. Popularity comes from strength. A Government that rules by daily poll will be blown about by every fickle shift in the breezes of public opinion. A Prime Minister who can only see his government through the distorting glass of his reflection in the media will become the plaything of every gusty newspaper. This is to govern by the doctrine: I am their leader, I must follow them.</p> <p>It is exactly this approach - chasing every headline, genuflecting to every poll - which has spread the sensation accurately identified by the focus grouper that 'for much of the last 18 months, the Government has been drifting, growing almost monthly weaker and more diffuse'. The Tories have not done this, nor the Left, nor the media. New Labour's worst enemy is itself.</p> <p>The glib answer is to call for the sacking of Philip Gould for giving alarmist counsel which only serves to feed Tony Blair's own insecurity. Fire Alastair Campbell for facilitating a TV documentary that made the Prime Minister look like a bad repertory actor in a pantomime directed by his Press Secretary. And make a really ferocious blaze of the funeral pyre by hurling on Peter Mandelson as well. Are these not the baleful influences who have led astray a fundamentally idealistic leader and made a decent man look like a phoney? The sacrifice of one or all of these names would certainly be popular with much of the Labour Party as well as a lot of the Cabinet.</p> <p>But this is one populist sacrifice that the Prime Minister will not make. To kill his focus groupers and spin-meisters would be to murder half of himself. Of all the memos that have seeped out of Number 10, none has been so lethal to the character of the Prime Minister as that penned by Tony Blair himself. 'We are perceived as soft _ We are perceived as weak _ this even applies to me,' a Prime Minister writes, revealing that there is no one more fixated with image than the leader. The dotty idea of frogmarching drunks to the nearest cashpoint was not the product of the adolescent imagination of some spotty junior ranker at Number 10. It springs from the feverish head of Government. To answer the charge that he is 'out of touch with gut British instincts', he scrapes around for 'two or three eye-catching initiatives'. The eye they are designed to catch is that of the headline writer. 'We should think now of ... locking up street muggers. Something tough, with immediate bite ... This should be done soon and I, personally, should be associated with it.'</p> <p>The spinner cum laude , the greatest presentational obsessive of them all, is revealed by his own hand to be the Prime Minister himself. And it is wholly counter-productive. The same right-wing tabloids to whom Mr Blair was seeking to pander turn on him for being so desperately grovelling. They snap off the hand that sought to feed their prejudices. The pursuit of popularity for its own sake is ultimately unpopular with the very people it seeks to please. Nothing has done more damage to the public character of the Prime Minister than the accumulating impression that he seeks only to ingratiate. Uriah Heep lives in Downing Street.</p> <p>TONY BLAIR is New Labour; New Labour is Tony Blair. The concentration of power at the top, this rule by iron panic, means that his strengths and weaknesses are the Government's advantages and flaws. There is a highly attractive side to this Prime Minister, which he is still capable of summoning up to the advantage of himself and the country. He has a sense of strategic direction and an ambition to be remembered by history as the man who won this century for pro-European, moderately social democratic progressive values. He has shown, most notably in Northern Ireland and during the Kosovo conflict, a capacity to take the bold risks without which great rewards are never won.</p> <p>But there have ever been two Blairs struggling with each other inside Number 10. There is that blue sky visionary, a telescope trained on the horizon of the future. There is also the febrile tactician, microscopically scanning yesterday's headlines. This easily rattled, often flailing Blair was for a long time largely concealed from view. It was one of Alastair Campbell's great victories of spin, the deceiving spin of the strong leader. The weak side of the Prime Minister has always been there; the public just haven't been so well-acquainted with him until now.</p> <p>He would rationalise his tactics with his strategy by saying that only by retaining short-term popularity can he achieve long-term goals. But the strategy has been too often suborned by the tactics. Worse, it is the frantic flailing about for populist stunts that is actually costing him respect.</p> <p>The Cabinet has been marginalised as a collective forum for decision-making. The party is unloved by the leader, and reciprocates the lack of regard. When the going gets rough, there can be no confidence in the support of the tribe, not least because New Labour was erected on the rubble of so many of its household gods. The danger for the leader is that he turns even more doomily introspective. He becomes even more dependent on the select trusties and small number of courtiers who shelter with him inside the confines of the bunker where they feed each other's self-destructive neuroticism. This way lies a paranoid spiral into disaster. For if he thrashes about like this when his Government is still doing relatively well, how will the Prime Minister behave when there is a real crisis to deal with?</p> <p>In the manic depressive way so characteristic of New Labour, you can hear predictions from within the Downing Street enclave of the size of the next majority being anything between a crushing 200 and an anorexic 20. The latter outcome is to be contemplated with horror. It is the scenario in which Tony Blair tries to pander even more frantically to the Right while being arm-locked by a vengefully resurgent Left.</p> <p>There is a way for him to avoid this apocalypse of the second term. It is to get back in touch with his better half, that leader who had confidence in progressive values and the courage to press them with conviction.</p> <p>'We need to reinvent the New Labour brand,' advises Philip Gould on behalf of the marketing men. This is the answer, is it? New New Labour? Not for Tony Blair, it isn't. What he has to rediscover is the old young Blair, the dazzling man who assumed leadership six summers past and commanded the heights with self-belief and a sense of destiny.</p> <p>What is truly gruesome is not that so many other people, including his closest advisors, now see him as a failing brand. It's that he seems to regard himself the same way. You are not a product, Mr Blair. You are supposed to be a Prime Minister.</p>",

      "bodyText": "IT WAS IN July 1994, when Tony Blair became leader and his small group of modernisers set about creating what he would soon christen 'a literally new party', that it was born. Six summers later, New Labour is dying. This is not a prediction that the Tories will win the next election. I'd still rather place a bet on Elvis landing a UFO on the head of the Loch Ness monster than stake a pound on William Hague moving into Number 10 within the next two years. Nor am I saying that the Government is a great disaster. This is, in so many respects, a remarkably successful administration which continues to enjoy high popularity ratings for the mid-term. What looks terminally green is the unique experiment with the British political system that was labelled New Labour. The backbench flies buzz down the fetid corridors of Westminster.

      "body": "<p>They call him Shrub, the little Bush. But next week in Philadelphia, the shrub will bloom, a tree in summer, as George W. Bush is crowned by those who have for years awaited this moment. The coronation will be the convention of the Republican Party which planted and nurtured the Shrub as its only hope of reconquering a White House from which it has been exiled eight long years.</p> <p>Bush heads for the convention with only the narrowest of leads over his rival Al Gore - but that will do nothing to cramp his Presidential style. For if Bush is not inevitable, he is nothing. He has campaigned in a relaxed, tactile, eye-to-eye style that is not visible on television. There is a 'What, me care?' feel to the candidacy.</p> <p>This is, of course, a deception. Bush's is one of the most carefully planned, packaged and managed campaigns within living political memory, which is fitting enough, for never can there have been an election between two candidates so meticulously groomed for this moment for as long as they have been alive. The main difference between them, as Professor Todd Gitlin, a scrutiniser of American politicians, says is that 'Gore is real trying to be fake, while Bush is fake trying to be real'.</p> <p>Both are the privileged sons of political heavyweights - a president and a senator. Both are sons of families that straddled the East coast establishment and points West, and both have elected to base their campaigns in the latter - portraying a hoe-down, home-town 'Washington outsider' from Tennessee and Texas respectively. In both cases, this is another monstrous deception. There are barely two men in America so well connected within the DC Beltway and who have used those connections so brazenly.</p> <p>But here lies the first and crucial difference between Bush and his rival, and the beginning of the curious manufacture of the man they will be calling 'President Bush II' over and over in Philadelphia.</p> <p>Bush's candidacy is a family drama as well as a political one. Bush is a brand name, and George W. Bush was chosen by both family and party to play an almost Wagnerian role in the history of his dynasty. Once the rebel son, he is now the man who must avenge his father's crushing 1992 defeat to the enemy whom Bush himself resembles in so many ways: Bill Clinton.</p> <p>Unlike the case of Gore, the campaign to place George W. Bush in the White House did not quite begin when he was in utero . Like Gore, George 'Dubya' Bush was born into political privilege, but unlike Gore, Bush's boyhood in Midland, Texas, was a fairly normal one, getting belted at school for painting a beard on his teacher's face and bicycling in jeans and T-shirt around the streets of a rigidly segregated oil boomtown that was never going to spawn much of a postcard industry.</p> <p>He was an under-achiever at school, as his grades, published by the New Yorker , revealed to the hilarity of its readers on the Upper West Side but - crucially - to the total indifference of most Americans, who performed even worse. If anyone it was the younger Jeb Bush who was deemed destined for great things in politics, while Dubya famously became the wild child. There may have been US presidential candidates who while at High School dressed up in drag with a wig and shook a leg from beneath a white mini-skirt, but few who did it for the cameras and posterity.</p> <p>Next came Bush's frat brat years at Harvard, where - according to accusations he has never denied - he was famously a voracious consumer of cocaine and the opposite sex. Fellow alumnae recall that Bush was 'in a different league' when it came to champagne during these binges. But Bush's supposed nemesis, Bill Clinton, has already proved that voting America cares little or nothing for such stories, nor would the Democrats dare to call Bush on them.</p> <p>It was not Bush's wild years that was the hostage to fortune in Republican politics, but his record over Vietnam. Bush comes from a family of war heroes. His father and grandfather were decorated in combat. The Republican Party defines men of Bush's generation by their service records during Vietnam. Draft-dodging is the ultimate heresy.</p> <p>But both family and party are about to crown a man who was spared the killing fields of South-East Asia because his father put in a call to get young Bush admitted to the Texas National Guard which would protect him from combat in the paddy fields. George Senior's help and name set the tone for the young Bush's business career too. And Dubya's early start in the oil business, his foray into Wall Street and the urban jungle of investments - even his acquisition of the Texas Rangers baseball team - follow a pattern. It is roughly this: Bush invests a little in an enterprise which either performs with studied mediocrity and is bailed out, or else is pumped full of money by investors anxious to orbit around the son of a prestigious Senator, Vice President and finally President of the USA. 'I was a pit bull on the pant leg of opportunity,' Bush himself once said in one of his more insightful remarks.</p> <p>Bush pretends that he 'never dreamt about being President' and recalls his joy when communications director Karen Hughes waltzed into his office one day in the summer of 1997 and told him - to his amazement - that he was leading his Republican rivals for the nomination. This was pure guff. The plot to find a pretender to the throne George Bush Snr had lost to Bill Clinton in 1992 began soon after the loss of a second election by Bob Dole the previous year.</p> <p>Bush's campaign manager Karl Rove arranged for just about every heavyweight bankroller of the Republican Party to visit - together or singly - and come away convinced he was the way back to the White House. The money came flooding in at such a rate that Bush quickly broke all election spending records, spending an average of $1.3 million a day since the campaign was officially opened - an unintended portion of the funds spent on seeing off the challenge of the real war hero Senator John McCain.</p> <p>At Philadelphia, Bush will perform a delicate balancing act his father also knew well over whether to accommodate or denounce the Republican right wing. He will accomplish it by being two things: presidential, and all things to all people. He will try to retain the Republican Party's conservative base while courting the moderates and their supporters in the political centre that he needs to win the country.</p> <p>And in doing so, even at this late stage, Bush 'is still a work-in-progress', according to William Niskenan, a former Reagan adviser and now director of the Conservative Cato Institute in Washington. For underneath it all Bush is a devout conservative.

      "bodyText": "They call him Shrub, the little Bush. But next week in Philadelphia, the shrub will bloom, a tree in summer, as George W. Bush is crowned by those who have for years awaited this moment. The coronation will be the convention of the Republican Party which planted and nurtured the Shrub as its only hope of reconquering a White House from which it has been exiled eight long years. Bush heads for the convention with only the narrowest of leads over his rival Al Gore - but that will do nothing to cramp his Presidential style. For if Bush is not inevitable, he is nothing. He has campaigned in a relaxed, tactile, eye-to-eye style that is not visible on television. There is a 'What, me care?' feel to the candidacy. This is, of course, a deception. Bush's is one of the most carefully planned, packaged and managed campaigns within living political memory, which is fitting enough, for never can there have been an election between two candidates so meticulously groomed for this moment for as long as they have been alive. The main difference between them, as Professor Todd Gitlin, a scrutiniser of American politicians, says is that 'Gore is real trying to be fake, while Bush is fake trying to be real'. Both are the privileged sons of political heavyweights - a president and a senator. Both are sons of families that straddled the East coast establishment and points West, and both have elected to base their campaigns in the latter - portraying a hoe-down, home-town 'Washington outsider' from Tennessee and Texas respectively. In both cases, this is another monstrous deception. There are barely two men in America so well connected within the DC Beltway and who have used those connections so brazenly. But here lies the first and crucial difference between Bush and his rival, and the beginning of the curious manufacture of the man they will be calling 'President Bush II' over and over in Philadelphia. Bush's candidacy is a family drama as well as a political one. Bush is a brand name, and George W. Bush was chosen by both family and party to play an almost Wagnerian role in the history of his dynasty. Once the rebel son, he is now the man who must avenge his father's crushing 1992 defeat to the enemy whom Bush himself resembles in so many ways: Bill Clinton. Unlike the case of Gore, the campaign to place George W. Bush in the White House did not quite begin when he was in utero . Like Gore, George 'Dubya' Bush was born into political privilege, but unlike Gore, Bush's boyhood in Midland, Texas, was a fairly normal one, getting belted at school for painting a beard on his teacher's face and bicycling in jeans and T-shirt around the streets of a rigidly segregated oil boomtown that was never going to spawn much of a postcard industry. He was an under-achiever at school, as his grades, published by the New Yorker , revealed to the hilarity of its readers on the Upper West Side but - crucially - to the total indifference of most Americans, who performed even worse. If anyone it was the younger Jeb Bush who was deemed destined for great things in politics, while Dubya famously became the wild child. There may have been US presidential candidates who while at High School dressed up in drag with a wig and shook a leg from beneath a white mini-skirt, but few who did it for the cameras and posterity. Next came Bush's frat brat years at Harvard, where - according to accusations he has never denied - he was famously a voracious consumer of cocaine and the opposite sex. Fellow alumnae recall that Bush was 'in a different league' when it came to champagne during these binges. But Bush's supposed nemesis, Bill Clinton, has already proved that voting America cares little or nothing for such stories, nor would the Democrats dare to call Bush on them. It was not Bush's wild years that was the hostage to fortune in Republican politics, but his record over Vietnam. Bush comes from a family of war heroes. His father and grandfather were decorated in combat. The Republican Party defines men of Bush's generation by their service records during Vietnam. Draft-dodging is the ultimate heresy. But both family and party are about to crown a man who was spared the killing fields of South-East Asia because his father put in a call to get young Bush admitted to the Texas National Guard which would protect him from combat in the paddy fields. George Senior's help and name set the tone for the young Bush's business career too. And Dubya's early start in the oil business, his foray into Wall Street and the urban jungle of investments - even his acquisition of the Texas Rangers baseball team - follow a pattern. It is roughly this: Bush invests a little in an enterprise which either performs with studied mediocrity and is bailed out, or else is pumped full of money by investors anxious to orbit around the son of a prestigious Senator, Vice President and finally President of the USA. 'I was a pit bull on the pant leg of opportunity,' Bush himself once said in one of his more insightful remarks. Bush pretends that he 'never dreamt about being President' and recalls his joy when communications director Karen Hughes waltzed into his office one day in the summer of 1997 and told him - to his amazement - that he was leading his Republican rivals for the nomination. This was pure guff. The plot to find a pretender to the throne George Bush Snr had lost to Bill Clinton in 1992 began soon after the loss of a second election by Bob Dole the previous year. Bush's campaign manager Karl Rove arranged for just about every heavyweight bankroller of the Republican Party to visit - together or singly - and come away convinced he was the way back to the White House. The money came flooding in at such a rate that Bush quickly broke all election spending records, spending an average of $1.3 million a day since the campaign was officially opened - an unintended portion of the funds spent on seeing off the challenge of the real war hero Senator John McCain. At Philadelphia, Bush will perform a delicate balancing act his father also knew well over whether to accommodate or denounce the Republican right wing. He will accomplish it by being two things: presidential, and all things to all people. He will try to retain the Republican Party's conservative base while courting the moderates and their supporters in the political centre that he needs to win the country. And in doing so, even at this late stage, Bush 'is still a work-in-progress', according to William Niskenan, a former Reagan adviser and now director of the Conservative Cato Institute in Washington. For underneath it all Bush is a devout conservative. His positions on guns, abortion, private school vouchers, taxes (audaciously favourable to the super-rich) and social security (a huge privatisation programme) are well known. But at the same time, Bush has been throwing out other signals that mask his innate conservatism: like spending more on welfare and a passion for education investment. Congress, Bush has said, should not balance the budget 'on the backs of the poor'. Indeed, ever since he effectively secured the nomination with a brash display of ultra-conservatism in the South Carolina primary, Bush has been prepared to confront the Republican right on Capitol Hill in bursts of what pundits have called 'triangulation' which recall Clinton himself. He has said he aims to end to take the 'partisan poison' and 'discord' out of business on Capitol Hill - a tale told as part of the honest Texan package. If Bush has shown a weakness it has been in his difficulties in his grasp on foreign policy, famously confusing the Greeks and 'Grecians', Slovenia and Slovakia - but even this is partly contrived: there comes a point at which Americans prefer it that way anyway. The two remaining questions are for the future: will he get elected? And is Dubya smart enough to carry off the Presidency? His retort to the second was a swift one: 'I'm plenty smart 'nuff.' His retort to the first came in one of his best and most typically adroit lines of late, a reference to Al Gore's many staff reshuffles. 'You can shuffle the deck chairs around much as you like.

      "body": "<p>The former vice-chairman of the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff leaned forward intently. 'Some people now talk of the state as a legacy activity,' he declared. 'That is not my view. There remains a legitimate role for the Government in supporting business.' Thanks a lot. Doubtless, Bill Owens meant well, but his less than comprehensive defence of the state as an activity relevant now and in the future spoke volumes. # # We live in a civilisation which celebrates the private sector and is sceptical about government as never before. We used to mock the notion that the state could be privatised and that the role of elected politicians would be no more than drawing up contracts with private companies for minimal public provision, but that is overtly the conservative agenda, especially in the US. Watch out. It is American values that now colonise our political and intellectual establishment. In this world view, government activity is justified only in if it does not obstruct the onward march of business. If it has to spend, it must do so only in those areas where it is proven that there is no private alternative. British Tories know they can advance this agenda cautiously, but it is the vision that informs their politics.</p> <p>It is in this context that last week's Comprehensive Spending Review should be judged. The statistical annexe of the document shows that over the last five years public expenditure has shrunk by 5 per cent of GDP or some \u00a350 billion, a fifth of the decline represented by a calamitous fall in public investment. Stripped of the hyperbole, all that New Labour is now proposing is a partial and cautious reversal of that trend financed by the tax increases it levied in 1997 and 1998 and lower debt interest and social security spending. By 2003, public investment will nearly be as high as in 1993.</p> <p>Health expenditure will have grown nearly as fast as during the last Labour government, while education expenditure will have edged slightly higher as a proportion of GDP than John Major spent. So tight has the control on public spending been during the last two years of the Tories and the first three years of New Labour that some recovery to where it might have been had it been allowed to grow in line with economic growth is hailed as a major triumph for social democratic politics.</p> <p>The trouble is that our political discourse has now moved so far to the Right and so dominant is the anti-state consensus that New Labour is partly justified in making that claim. The growth rate in departmental spending, albeit from a desperately depressed level, in education, health, Home Office and transport spending is impressive. But it needs to be. We have the lowest number of doctors in Europe per head apart from Turkey; the most congested roads; the lowest spending per head on secondary school and university students. If the spending is sustained, as it should be because Gordon Brown has made certain the plans are almost bomb-proof, then Britain will have climbed towards, but still fall short of the European average in most areas of public provision. Extraordinarily, shadow Chancellor Michael Portillo is not laughed out of the TV and radio studios when he talks of spending \u00a317bn less more wisely to produce better results.</p> <p>Where, pray, are the cuts to come from?

      "bodyText": "The former vice-chairman of the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff leaned forward intently. 'Some people now talk of the state as a legacy activity,' he declared. 'That is not my view. There remains a legitimate role for the Government in supporting business.' Thanks a lot. Doubtless, Bill Owens meant well, but his less than comprehensive defence of the state as an activity relevant now and in the future spoke volumes. # # We live in a civilisation which celebrates the private sector and is sceptical about government as never before. We used to mock the notion that the state could be privatised and that the role of elected politicians would be no more than drawing up contracts with private companies for minimal public provision, but that is overtly the conservative agenda, especially in the US. Watch out. It is American values that now colonise our political and intellectual establishment. In this world view, government activity is justified only in if it does not obstruct the onward march of business. If it has to spend, it must do so only in those areas where it is proven that there is no private alternative. British Tories know they can advance this agenda cautiously, but it is the vision that informs their politics. It is in this context that last week's Comprehensive Spending Review should be judged. The statistical annexe of the document shows that over the last five years public expenditure has shrunk by 5 per cent of GDP or some \u00a350 billion, a fifth of the decline represented by a calamitous fall in public investment. Stripped of the hyperbole, all that New Labour is now proposing is a partial and cautious reversal of that trend financed by the tax increases it levied in 1997 and 1998 and lower debt interest and social security spending. By 2003, public investment will nearly be as high as in 1993. Health expenditure will have grown nearly as fast as during the last Labour government, while education expenditure will have edged slightly higher as a proportion of GDP than John Major spent. So tight has the control on public spending been during the last two years of the Tories and the first three years of New Labour that some recovery to where it might have been had it been allowed to grow in line with economic growth is hailed as a major triumph for social democratic politics. The trouble is that our political discourse has now moved so far to the Right and so dominant is the anti-state consensus that New Labour is partly justified in making that claim. The growth rate in departmental spending, albeit from a desperately depressed level, in education, health, Home Office and transport spending is impressive. But it needs to be. We have the lowest number of doctors in Europe per head apart from Turkey; the most congested roads; the lowest spending per head on secondary school and university students. If the spending is sustained, as it should be because Gordon Brown has made certain the plans are almost bomb-proof, then Britain will have climbed towards, but still fall short of the European average in most areas of public provision. Extraordinarily, shadow Chancellor Michael Portillo is not laughed out of the TV and radio studios when he talks of spending \u00a317bn less more wisely to produce better results. Where, pray, are the cuts to come from? Eighty per cent of the increased spending is going to transport, education, health, the Home Office and defence. Little or none is directed at social security recipients. Public-sector pay is assumed to rise no faster than inflation. There is absolutely no give in the numbers. If we want a moderately funded health and education system along with some attempt to halt the growth in traffic congestion, New Labour has done the minimum necessary - and even that may be insufficient. For on one issue, the critics and Government agree. The question now is delivery. Brown has tried to meet the critique through an array of public-service agreements in which spending departments commit to achieve a range of improved outcomes with the extra cash; in the autumn, he plans to go a level deeper by publishing service delivery agreements in which departments specify precisely how they are to achieve the targets to which they are committed. This does represent a reinforcement of centralised Treasury power, but a mechanism is needed to ensure that cash translates into better outcomes. This is the decisive roll of the dice. If within two or three years there is no significant improvement in public services despite the trumpeted increase in public spending, then the 'state-as-legacy' anti-public-sector mood will be reinforced and the case for tax-funded public- service provision will be seriously damaged. On this, New Labour must make its stand or it is lost. But has it already hampered its own cause, both substantively and in terms of its message? You can't improve public services without motivated people. Yet recruitment to the public sector is becoming increasingly difficult, not only because of indifferent pay, but because public-sector workers correctly see them selves, and the notion of public service, as having no champion. Teachers and doctors are attacked; managers and administrators are excoriated. Who would enter public service? This is the more serious criticism of the Number 10 'spinning' operation. In its pursuit of winning the headlines, it has lost sight of the Government's strategic mission.

The Provisional IRA, Irish National Liberation Army, the Loyalist Volunteer Force, the Ulster Volunteer Force and the Ulster Freedom Fighters may have found common cause in prison, but outside the walls remain bitter enemies.</p> <p>The political wings of the paramilitary groups made the early release of prisoners a common 'bottom line' during the talks that led to the Good Friday Agreement. The talks teams from Sinn Fein, the Progressive Unionist Party and the Ulster Democratic Party felt they owed 'their' prisoners that much. Also, many of the key players in the talks had 'done their wack' - served long prison sentences in the H-Blocks - and many of the same ex-prisoners are now sitting in the Northern Ireland Assembly or in local government.</p> <p>The recently elected Mayor of Derry, Cathal Crumley, took part in the 'dirty protest' in the late Seventies and early Eighties. Gerry Kelly, SF MLA for North Belfast, took part in the biggest mass breakout in British prison history when 38 IRA prisoners burst out in 1983, an escape that resulted in the death of a prison warder. The two PUP MLAs, Billy Hutchinson and David Ervine, served long sentences, as did the UDP's prison spokesman, John White.</p> <p>Gerry Adams was interned in the 'compounds', the Nissen huts that stand abandoned beside the 12ft walls of the Maze, and spent seven months in the H-Blocks as a remand prisoner in 1977.</p> <p>Months before the agreement was signed, Mo Mowlam became the first Secretary of State to meet prisoners in the H-Blocks, when she secured the retention of the UFF ceasefire by meeting its prisoners. The UFF had taken part in at least three murders 'in retaliation' for another incident in the Maze, the shooting dead by INLA inmates of the LVF leader Billy Wright.</p> <p>Earlier in the same month of December 1997, Liam Averill, an IRA prisoner, escaped dressed as a woman after a Christmas party for inmates' families.</p> <p>Furious unionists demanded explanations and rolling heads.

Internal control of the wings came from an appointed representative of the prisoners, who in turn would report to the 'Officer Commanding' the prisoners for that particular faction.</p> <p>In the late Nineties the OC of the Provo prisoners was Padraig Wilson, whose clout was demonstrated by the willingness of the authorities to allow him out to influence events. On one occasion, he left to address the SF special conference in favour of accepting the Good Friday deal. He is now believed to be involved as an interlocutor with the Decommissioning Commission.</p> <p>It is a long way from the early days of the H-Blocks, but 'similar to the system in the cages', the compound system that held paramilitary prisoners and internees in the early Seventies. Tommy Quigley was in the cages 1973-75, and later spent two years in the Maze in the late Nineties, after being transferred from England, where he had been sentenced for bomb attacks in London in the early Eighties. Quigley recalls watching the cranes working on the new prison in late 1975, and being told by the authorities they were building 'improved accommodation'.</p> <p>The eight blocks were built by the then Labour Government after the failure of the Sunningdale experiment in power-sharing. In 1975-76, the buzz words were 'normalisation', 'Ulsterisation' and 'criminalisation'. The role of the British Army was reduced as the RUC and locally recruited UDR handled security, while the no-jury Diplock courts acted as a 'conveyer belt' for IRA and loyalist offenders. From 1 March 1976, 'political status' was withdrawn, and anyone convicted of a scheduled offence was to be treated as an ordinary prisoner.</p> <p>The first convicted IRA man to be handed a prison uniform was Kieran Nugent, who died at 42 two months ago. He refused, saying he was not a common criminal. Instead, he wrapped himself in the coarse prison issue blanket in his cell. Thus began a struggle between authorities and prisoners which escalated into violence, degradation and death. Prisoners lost all privileges, such as visits, education and exercise for years at a time.</p> <p>Furniture was smashed and removed, leaving two men per cell with a mattress, a blanket, a chamber pot and a Bible. They would be moved to different cells every 10 days. Beatings and rough searches were commonplace, escalated in turn by the IRA's shooting of prison officials (24 were killed, including the governor of the Maze). When the 'screws' refused to empty the overflowing chamber pots, their contents were smeared over the walls of the cells. 'Believe it or not, it helped dissipate the smell,' says Mairtin O Mhuaidh, who joined the 'no-wash' or 'dirty' protest in 1977.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the 'smell could be stomach-churning', recalls O Mhuaidh, not to mention the 'disgusting' food and the regular sight of maggots. They emptied the urine from their chamber pots through their doors onto the landing and built bread dams across the bottom of the doors to stop the contents flowing back into their cells. The then Archbishop of Armagh, Thomas O Fiaich, felt sick after visiting the blocks in 1978.</p> <p>Eventually, under the leadership of Brendan Hughes, IRA prisoners wore uniforms in order to meet visitors. 'Comms', letters in tiny writing on toilet paper, were smuggled out, usually transferred by a kiss. The seats of the uniforms were torn so that other items could be smuggled inside. Biro refills, letters, tiny crystal radios in test tubes, were carried anally, or swallowed.</p> <p>On the way to and from visits, prisoners would be held down and forced to squat over a mirror, or be probed by prison officers wearing surgical gloves. If caught smuggling, visits would be banned for three months.</p> <p>The prison authorities refused to recognise the internal leadership of IRA or loyalist prisoners. But a system of communication was improvised so most prisoners were kept aware of events in other wings. The only time prisoners met as a group was Sunday Mass, where a high turnout was guaranteed.</p> <p>Even education continued, with daily classes in Irish being shouted from one cell during lunch. O Mhuaidh, who now runs an Irish language group in Belfast, learnt the language in those conditions. He would clean an area of cell wall, and scratch notes of the day's lesson with a holy medal or a tube of toothpaste. Then things escalated to the point of last resort; hunger strike. The IRA outside was opposed to this option, arguing that it 'deflected resources from the war', but, according to Tommy McKearney, 'it was prisoner-led'.</p> <p>'There was no other way out for us,' says O Mhuaidh. 'If we didn't see it through until the end, the long-term effect on the republican movement would have been disastrous'. The prisoners' argument was that, if the battle in the H-Blocks was lost, it would have been tantamount to an admission that the IRA was a criminal organisation. As a ballad of the time put it; 'I'll wear no prison uniform, Nor meekly serve my time, And let England reduce Ireland's fight, To 800 years of crime.'</p> <p>'Compromise was not possible,' remembers Tommy McKearney, 'it would have had the effect of dissolving the ideology of the movement.'</p> <p>Thus, McKearney and six others went on hunger strike in late 1980, demanding the right to wear their own clothes, not to do prison work, for segregation into their own wings, for lost privileges and 'creature comforts' such as education and visits. McKearney 'was all right' for the first 45 days without food, before collapsing as his liver failed and his eyesight blurred to nothing. He began to lapse into delirium.</p> <p>By day 53, he was on the verge of a coma when the strike was called off by Brendan Hughes, who thought the Thatcher Government had conceded. As the weeks passed, it became clear that the Lady had not turned. McKearney felt 'desperately despondent'.</p> <p>Others started another hunger strike. Bobby Sands went first. In the course of his fast, he won a by-election for the Westminster seat of Fermanagh-South Tyrone, showing world opinion that the IRA prisoners had public support and allowing SF leaders such as Adams to argue to the 'militarists' in the republican movement that elections were a viable complement to (and eventually, alternative to) 'armed struggle'.</p> <p>Sands died after 66 days, his passing memorably recorded by Radio Moscow thus: 'The British MP Bobby Sands died of starvation today in Long Kesh concentration camp in occupied Ireland.' Unsurprisingly, Thatcher was unmoved by the presence of up to 100,000 people at Sands's funeral.</p> <p>Nine more men would die before an uncertain ending. But by the mid-Eighties, the 'five demands' were 'won by stealth by the prisoners themselves', according to O Mhuaidh.</p> <p>What should be done with the H-Blocks? The Prison Service plans to close the prison by the end of the year, and talks of 'mothballing' it in the eventuality of a future civil breakdown. Others in government would like to see it 'razed'. Ex-prisoners contacted by The Observer were unanimous. At least one block should be kept, as a museum for future generations.</p> <p>Republicans would like to preserve the prison hospital were the 10 hunger-strikers died, a permanent reminder of their most potent 'martyr' of the recent conflict, Bobby Sands.</p> <p><b>Inmates who will be on the move: murderers, bombers, commanders, torturers, icons</b></p> <p><b>Michael Stone</b> <br>Tomorrow sees the release of the most formidable loyalist icon of the troubles. Michael Stone shot his way to fame in 1988 when he made a lone assault at an IRA funeral, killing three mourners with a handgun and grenades. He was due to remain in prison until 2007 for the three he murdered at Milltown cemetery, and three other sectarian killings. The UFF member from east Belfast was accorded a hero's welcome at a pro-Agreement rally organised by the UDP at the Ulster Hall in 1998, for which Stone was allowed temporary release. According to loyalist legend, Stone once beat up Johnny Adair in prison.</p> <p><b>Johnny Adair</b> <br>Mo Mowlam lost a court action when she tried to delay the early release of Adair, the commander of the Shankill UFF. Adair once boasted of being behind the killing of over 20 Catholics, before being the only man ever charged and convicted of 'directing terrorism' in 1995. Since his release late last year, he was noticeably active during the Drumcree protests, and has forged links with the LVF in Portadown.</p> <p><b>Sean Kelly</b> <br>There is a mural on the Shankill showing the Grim Reaper hovering over three gravestones. On one of the graves is the name of Sean Kelly, who killed nine protestants (and an IRA colleague) in the 1993 Shankill Road bomb. Thousands of unionists have signed a petition calling for his release to be blocked.</p> <p><b>Pat Magee</b> <br>Magee, who was released last year, was inches away from becoming the Lee Harvey Oswald of British history, when the bomb he designed to kill Margaret Thatcher and half of her cabinet exploded in the Grand Hotel in Brighton, during the Tory party conference in 1994. Five people were killed in the explosion.</p> <p><b>Norman Coopey</b> <br>The Orange Order have yet to expel LVF killer Norman Coopey, so someone forgives him. In 1997, Coopey and a colleague dragged into their car a 16-year-old catholic, James Morgan, beat and tortured him, burned his body and threw his remains into a pit full of animal carcasses.</p> <p><b>Michael Caraher</b> <br>Carraher killed at least 12 members of the security forces. His last victim was Stephen Restorick, shot dead in febuary 1997 in Bessbrook, south Armagh.</p> <p><b>James McArdle</b> <br>Killed two newspaper sellers and devastated Canary Wharf in the 1996 bomb which signalled that the IRA ceasefire was over.</p> <p><b>Torrens Knight</b> <br>Like many loyalist prisoners, Knight was 'born again' in the Maze, and 'Pastor' Knight will be free to preach God's message of forgiveness next Sunday. Convicted of 11 murders in two UFF massacres at Greysteel and Castlerock in 1993, his most famous utterance was his loud shout on that Hallowe'en night as he burst into the Rising Sun bar in Greysteel; 'Trick or treat'.</p> <p><b>Christopher McWilliams</b> <br>'Crip' as the OC of the INLA prisoners is known, will be transferred to Magaberry next Friday along with 15 others whose 'life sentences' were imposed less than two years ago. His last offence was the December 1997 assassination of LVF leader Billy He denies saying to an RUC detective when charged with Wright's murder: 'Billy won't be getting out in two years.'</p> <p><b>Stephen McClean and Noel NcCready</b> <br>On Friday McClean and McCready were refused bail after being charged with attempted murder while out on temporary parole two weeks ago. The two LVF prisoners, who were sentenced two years ago for the pub shooting in Poyntzpass, allegedly tried to beat to death a young man who objected to them pulling down UVF flags in Banbridge, Co Down. If found guilty, the two could be sentenced to up to 15 years in the non-segregated prison Magaberry</p>",

Even education continued, with daily classes in Irish being shouted from one cell during lunch. O Mhuaidh, who now runs an Irish language group in Belfast, learnt the language in those conditions. He would clean an area of cell wall, and scratch notes of the day's lesson with a holy medal or a tube of toothpaste. Then things escalated to the point of last resort; hunger strike. The IRA outside was opposed to this option, arguing that it 'deflected resources from the war', but, according to Tommy McKearney, 'it was prisoner-led'. 'There was no other way out for us,' says O Mhuaidh. 'If we didn't see it through until the end, the long-term effect on the republican movement would have been disastrous'. The prisoners' argument was that, if the battle in the H-Blocks was lost, it would have been tantamount to an admission that the IRA was a criminal organisation. As a ballad of the time put it; 'I'll wear no prison uniform, Nor meekly serve my time, And let England reduce Ireland's fight, To 800 years of crime.' 'Compromise was not possible,' remembers Tommy McKearney, 'it would have had the effect of dissolving the ideology of the movement.' Thus, McKearney and six others went on hunger strike in late 1980, demanding the right to wear their own clothes, not to do prison work, for segregation into their own wings, for lost privileges and 'creature comforts' such as education and visits. McKearney 'was all right' for the first 45 days without food, before collapsing as his liver failed and his eyesight blurred to nothing. He began to lapse into delirium. By day 53, he was on the verge of a coma when the strike was called off by Brendan Hughes, who thought the Thatcher Government had conceded. As the weeks passed, it became clear that the Lady had not turned. McKearney felt 'desperately despondent'. Others started another hunger strike. Bobby Sands went first. In the course of his fast, he won a by-election for the Westminster seat of Fermanagh-South Tyrone, showing world opinion that the IRA prisoners had public support and allowing SF leaders such as Adams to argue to the 'militarists' in the republican movement that elections were a viable complement to (and eventually, alternative to) 'armed struggle'. Sands died after 66 days, his passing memorably recorded by Radio Moscow thus: 'The British MP Bobby Sands died of starvation today in Long Kesh concentration camp in occupied Ireland.' Unsurprisingly, Thatcher was unmoved by the presence of up to 100,000 people at Sands's funeral. Nine more men would die before an uncertain ending. But by the mid-Eighties, the 'five demands' were 'won by stealth by the prisoners themselves', according to O Mhuaidh. What should be done with the H-Blocks? The Prison Service plans to close the prison by the end of the year, and talks of 'mothballing' it in the eventuality of a future civil breakdown. Others in government would like to see it 'razed'. Ex-prisoners contacted by The Observer were unanimous. At least one block should be kept, as a museum for future generations. Republicans would like to preserve the prison hospital were the 10 hunger-strikers died, a permanent reminder of their most potent 'martyr' of the recent conflict, Bobby Sands. Inmates who will be on the move: murderers, bombers, commanders, torturers, icons Michael Stone Tomorrow sees the release of the most formidable loyalist icon of the troubles. Michael Stone shot his way to fame in 1988 when he made a lone assault at an IRA funeral, killing three mourners with a handgun and grenades. He was due to remain in prison until 2007 for the three he murdered at Milltown cemetery, and three other sectarian killings. The UFF member from east Belfast was accorded a hero's welcome at a pro-Agreement rally organised by the UDP at the Ulster Hall in 1998, for which Stone was allowed temporary release. According to loyalist legend, Stone once beat up Johnny Adair in prison. Johnny Adair Mo Mowlam lost a court action when she tried to delay the early release of Adair, the commander of the Shankill UFF. Adair once boasted of being behind the killing of over 20 Catholics, before being the only man ever charged and convicted of 'directing terrorism' in 1995. Since his release late last year, he was noticeably active during the Drumcree protests, and has forged links with the LVF in Portadown. Sean Kelly There is a mural on the Shankill showing the Grim Reaper hovering over three gravestones. On one of the graves is the name of Sean Kelly, who killed nine protestants (and an IRA colleague) in the 1993 Shankill Road bomb. Thousands of unionists have signed a petition calling for his release to be blocked. Pat Magee Magee, who was released last year, was inches away from becoming the Lee Harvey Oswald of British history, when the bomb he designed to kill Margaret Thatcher and half of her cabinet exploded in the Grand Hotel in Brighton, during the Tory party conference in 1994. Five people were killed in the explosion. Norman Coopey The Orange Order have yet to expel LVF killer Norman Coopey, so someone forgives him. In 1997, Coopey and a colleague dragged into their car a 16-year-old catholic, James Morgan, beat and tortured him, burned his body and threw his remains into a pit full of animal carcasses. Michael Caraher Carraher killed at least 12 members of the security forces. His last victim was Stephen Restorick, shot dead in febuary 1997 in Bessbrook, south Armagh. James McArdle Killed two newspaper sellers and devastated Canary Wharf in the 1996 bomb which signalled that the IRA ceasefire was over. Torrens Knight Like many loyalist prisoners, Knight was 'born again' in the Maze, and 'Pastor' Knight will be free to preach God's message of forgiveness next Sunday. Convicted of 11 murders in two UFF massacres at Greysteel and Castlerock in 1993, his most famous utterance was his loud shout on that Hallowe'en night as he burst into the Rising Sun bar in Greysteel; 'Trick or treat'. Christopher McWilliams 'Crip' as the OC of the INLA prisoners is known, will be transferred to Magaberry next Friday along with 15 others whose 'life sentences' were imposed less than two years ago. His last offence was the December 1997 assassination of LVF leader Billy He denies saying to an RUC detective when charged with Wright's murder: 'Billy won't be getting out in two years.' Stephen McClean and Noel NcCready On Friday McClean and McCready were refused bail after being charged with attempted murder while out on temporary parole two weeks ago. The two LVF prisoners, who were sentenced two years ago for the pub shooting in Poyntzpass, allegedly tried to beat to death a young man who objected to them pulling down UVF flags in Banbridge, Co Down. If found guilty, the two could be sentenced to up to 15 years in the non-segregated prison Magaberry",

      "body": "<p>The continuity between Old Tory and New Labour has been made flesh in the permanent government of Britain by the Powell family. Sir Charles Powell (who insisted his name must be pronounced 'Pole' because it sounded classier) was Margaret Thatcher's foreign policy adviser. On May Day 1997, the waste and squalor of 18 years of Tory misrule was smashed by Tony Blair's charge to power. One of the fresh leader's first acts on that new dawn was to take Jonathan Powell from our Washington embassy and make him chief of staff and foreign policy adviser. Unlike his brother, Jonathan had the social confidence to pronounce Powell 'Powell', as did a third brother, Chris, who organised the advertising of the New Labour 'brand'.</p> <p>Siblings can be rivals but few have been able to spot the differences between Pole and Powell. Carla Pole, wife of Charles, befriended Peter Mandelson and protested about the pain her confidante suffered when he was briefly disgraced for forgetting to declare an enormous loan from Geoffrey Robinson, a man Mandelson's department was investigating for alleged breaches of company law. Jonathan added to the air of bipartisan conviviality by fighting to uphold the standards of the party of the family under a Labour government.</p> <p>Robin Cook thought he might break from the past. From now on, there would be an 'ethical dimension' to foreign policy, the Foreign Secretary said in June 1997. Powell was having none of it. Government advisers told me he stomped through Downing Street chanting: 'An ethical foreign policy is bollocks, an ethical foreign policy is bollocks.' I refuse to believe that a mandarin who can boast blood ties to a Pole could be that vulgar, but Blair's circle, the Department for Trade and Industry and BAe executives close to the Prime Minister nevertheless overruled Cook's attempts to stop the public purse subsidising arms sales to some of the worst and most insolvent governments on Earth.</p> <p>Cynics say you can't squeeze a wafer between the old and new regimes. Yet there is a distinction which the muddled arguments about spin grope towards. Unlike the Tories, New Labour covers reactionary politics with a bright, warm gloss.</p> <p>For three years, the Foreign Office has produced an annual report on its support for human rights. The first was a shameless piece of puffery which, without a wince or a blush, featured a photo of Cook and General Suharto, the mass-murdering Indonesian dictator, locked in a manly handshake. In an early manifestation of the marketing ethos which has defiled the Government, the report ignored the theocratic dictatorship of the House of Saud or massacres of the Algerian government for fear of disillusioning the reader about the source of our oil and gas imports</p> <p>The style and, to be fair, the content has improved since then. The third audit, released last week, shows a Foreign Office willing to condemn the death penalty or the oppression of women with a robustness the Conservatives would never match. Although everyone in Whitehall shudders at the mention of the words 'ethical dimension', Cook appears to be a goodish man fallen into bad company.</p> <p>His condemnations only go so far, however. He has divided the world into two spheres. There are unpleasant countries, such as Iraq and Serbia, with which Britain has no business interests. These are denounced without reserve and must suffer sanctions and war. Then there are unpleasant countries, such as Russia and Saudi Arabia, in which Britain has many business interests. These are denounced in the mildest tones and must suffer 'constructive engagement'.</p> <p>'Shorn of its colourful episodes, Yeltsin's Presidency will be respected for burying the Cold War,' intones Cook. The colourful episodes in question are the turning of Chechnya into a desert, the rise of gangster capitalism and the reduction of the bulk of the Russian population to such misery that male life expectancy has fallen by 10 years since the break-up of the Soviet Union. The Saudi Arabian monarchy is acknowledged to be a dictatorship, which is an advance, I suppose. But millions of pounds in bribes have been paid to persuade the Saudi royals to buy British arms, so criticism can be levelled only in 'frank but discreet exchanges'.</p> <p>Despite the effort to display a modicum of honesty, there is a chapter on one nation in which the PR is outrageous and the attempts to cover up iniquity are so blatant a child of three could see through them. That country is Britain, a small archipelago of islands off the north-west coast of Europe, which, we are told, has a government which has placed 'full respect of human rights' as a 'central objective' of domestic as well as foreign pol icy. The Foreign Office supports this bold claim by telling the world that an Immigration and Asylum Act has come into force which will ensure 'respect for the human rights' of refugees from oppression and 'create new support arrangements for asylum-seekers'.</p> <p>Cook is too embarrassed to mention that his colleagues have made it impossible for any refugee, however genuine, to reach Britain legally. Those who are here will have to support themselves with food vouchers worth \u00a335 a week and see the supermarkets pocket the change when they exchange the tokens for scanty rations. The Freedom of Information Bill is cited as evidence that the islands have modern, democratic rulers. The Act's sweet title hides sweeping provisions which will turn pretty much anything Ministers want to hide into official secrets, which the report can't find the space to discuss.</p> <p>Speaking of which, the Foreign Office has missed the prosecution of former MI5 agent David Shayler and journalists such as Tony Geraghty and my colleagues on the Guardian and The Observer for telling the truth about the operations of the security services. It is not only leftie columnists who get agitated about such matters. Last week, as the human rights report was being released, a UN report on human rights said the persecution of the legitimate inquiry in Britain and the Official Secrets Act were 'incompatible with media freedom'.</p> <p>Put this together and we have an official culture which believes the tricks of advertising will allow it to get away with a 'freedom of information' Bill that promotes secrecy and an Asylum Bill which denies asylum.

However, critics are expected to claim the scheme is a gimmick that is unlikely to have real impact. </p> <p>The move reflects growing public calls to 'bring back matron'. Surveys show widespread frustration that there is no obvious authority figure who can sort out problems and stop standards sliding. </p> <p>The patients' champions will come from all walks of life, including the customer services departments of industry. They will have direct access to hospital chief executives and ward sisters. The champions will operate in teams to help as many patients as possible. </p> <p>This is part of the National Plan, the wide-ranging reform which the Government insists will be the most radical since the NHS was founded in 1948. </p> <p>'Although staff are working tremendously hard, they are having to fight the system to get the patients the care they need,' Milburn told The Observer. 'There are a host of very basic things wrong. There are just too many stories about people not getting their food, or the treatment they need. What is lacking in a lot of hospitals is that sort of fast access for patients, that kind of figure of authority.' </p> <p>A damning report by consultants from the Virgin group last week highlighted squalid conditions, nurses reading newspapers at ward stations and the 'dead hand of bureaucracy' stifling staff who had lost pride in their jobs. Milburn said: 'The NHS has got to start thinking like a modern service sector industry where the interests of patients always come first.' </p> <p>The National Plan will promise an expansion of the hospital building programme, and a \u00a3400 million scheme to improve GP services by revamping crumbling surgeries and building a network of 'one-stop' centres in deprived neighbourhoods. </p> <p>The Department of Health has had great difficulties in getting GPs to work in poor areas, where the need for them is greatest. There will be financial incentives to attract and retain doctors. </p> <p>The plan will include a nine-month maximum waiting time for surgery, as revealed in The Observer last week, and the number of cancelled operations will be cut by sending patients to private hospitals. The elderly are expected to be given free nursing in residential homes, but continue to pay 'bed and board' charges. </p> <p>The central theme will be to put patients - rather than professionals - at the centre of the service. The patients' advocate scheme will be introduced first in major hospitals, then nationally, at a cost of more than \u00a310 million. </p> <p>The other main aim is to reduce inequalities, reflecting government concern that the poor have far worse access to the NHS than the affluent. </p> <p>In many deprived areas, there are so few GPs that it can take up to a week to get an appointment. A network of 'one stop' centres will provide GPs, social services, opticians, chemists and, in some cases, minor operations.</p>",

Surveys show widespread frustration that there is no obvious authority figure who can sort out problems and stop standards sliding. The patients' champions will come from all walks of life, including the customer services departments of industry. They will have direct access to hospital chief executives and ward sisters. The champions will operate in teams to help as many patients as possible. This is part of the National Plan, the wide-ranging reform which the Government insists will be the most radical since the NHS was founded in 1948. 'Although staff are working tremendously hard, they are having to fight the system to get the patients the care they need,' Milburn told The Observer. 'There are a host of very basic things wrong. There are just too many stories about people not getting their food, or the treatment they need. What is lacking in a lot of hospitals is that sort of fast access for patients, that kind of figure of authority.' A damning report by consultants from the Virgin group last week highlighted squalid conditions, nurses reading newspapers at ward stations and the 'dead hand of bureaucracy' stifling staff who had lost pride in their jobs. Milburn said: 'The NHS has got to start thinking like a modern service sector industry where the interests of patients always come first.' The National Plan will promise an expansion of the hospital building programme, and a \u00a3400 million scheme to improve GP services by revamping crumbling surgeries and building a network of 'one-stop' centres in deprived neighbourhoods. The Department of Health has had great difficulties in getting GPs to work in poor areas, where the need for them is greatest. There will be financial incentives to attract and retain doctors. The plan will include a nine-month maximum waiting time for surgery, as revealed in The Observer last week, and the number of cancelled operations will be cut by sending patients to private hospitals. The elderly are expected to be given free nursing in residential homes, but continue to pay 'bed and board' charges. The central theme will be to put patients - rather than professionals - at the centre of the service. The patients' advocate scheme will be introduced first in major hospitals, then nationally, at a cost of more than \u00a310 million. The other main aim is to reduce inequalities, reflecting government concern that the poor have far worse access to the NHS than the affluent. In many deprived areas, there are so few GPs that it can take up to a week to get an appointment. A network of 'one stop' centres will provide GPs, social services, opticians, chemists and, in some cases, minor operations.",

Her solicitor, Gareth Peirce, said she was surprised when she received a fax from the CPS last Wednesday telling her of the decision. In a statement laid before Parliament last week with no publicity, the Solicitor General, Ross Cranston, said no further action would be taken against McAliskey, whose case became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre during the 1990s.

Last night, in the sumptuous surroundings of Shurijo Castle, a fifteenth-century palace near the Busena Terrace beach resort, Tony Blair tucked into a five-course dinner to mark the end of the G8 summit in Okinawa, Japan.</p> <p>Lobster, duck, crab and caviar were followed by dried sea cucumber fried in rice, carp and red potatoes in lightly fried tempura. The evening was rounded off with a palate-cleansing melon and papaya dessert. Chablis Grand Cru, 1995 Vaudesir and 1996 Opus One accompanied the meal.</p> <p>Blair's mind must have flickered to what awaited him on his return to Britain. No 10 is gripped by one subject: who is the source of the plethora of memos tumbling out of the centre of government, revealing deep-seated worries at the heart of Blair's administration? Who is the disloyal one?</p> <p>There are two sides now to Blair; the authorised version and the unauthorised version. The public, suddenly, has been given a glimpse of the latter.</p> <p>In the authorised version, Blair is unconcerned by the fury of critics who say he is weak on crime, on asylum seekers, on the family. The authorised Blair wants to concentrate on education, jobs, the economy. His principles are deep-set and he will continue on course because he understands what is right.</p> <p>But Blair unauthorised is a different matter. His memo leaked earlier this week, and a linked memo from his close adviser, Philip Gould, betray a mind seized by doubts, a Prime Minister desperately casting around for new ideas, intensely worried about losing his political way, a man who has been told that the New Labour brand has been 'contaminated'.</p> <p>'There are a clutch of issues that are in fact linked,' the Prime Minister wrote in the memo entitled Touchstone Issues. 'They range from: the family where partly due to MCA [married couple's allowance] and gay issues we are perceived as weak; asylum and crime, where we are perceived as soft; and asserting the nation's interests where, because of the unpopularity of Europe, a constant barrage of small stories beginning to add up on defence and even issues like Zimbabwe, we are seen as insufficiently assertive.</p> <p>'All these things add up to a sense that the Government - and this even applies to me - are somehow out of touch with gut British instincts.' He called for 'eye-catching initiatives 'that should be 'personally associated' with the Prime Minister. He suggested 'locking up muggers' as a sign of strength. A few weeks after he wrote the memo came Blair's ill-judged plan for on-the-spot fines for criminals. Left-wing MPs have been shocked by the tone of Blair's words, one describing them as 'knee-jerkism gone mad'.</p> <p>Backbenchers and senior party and government figures told The Observer last week that the memo had achieved three things. It has strengthened the position of Gordon Brown, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, a man seen by backbenchers as principled. He made it clear in an interview with the Today programme that he hadn't read the memo from Gould, who is disliked by many on the left of the party. 'That was a nice touch,' said one backbench MP.</p> <p>Second, and for similar reasons, it has strengthened John Prescott, the Deputy Prime Minister, and David Blunkett, the education sec retary, who have distanced themselves from Gould's comments. They are now pressing for an end to the New Labour lexicon of soundbites. 'We have to get back to language that people actually understand,' said one Labour source. 'Get away from automaton talk.'</p> <p>Thirdly, it has damaged Blair in the minds of many within the Labour Party who were shocked that he was able to write a memo which seemed so closely to reflect the views of the Daily Mail. Alastair Campbell, the Prime Minister's official spokesman, insists that out there, among the general public, they care about jobs and education, not about leaked memos. So why, Blair's critics ask, did he write such a stinging attack on his government's methods?</p> <p>The first rumbles started on Friday afternoon, nine days ago. The phone rang in the office of Andrew Pierce, the assistant editor of the Times. On the end of the line was someone with some interesting information. It was the Blair memo.</p> <p>Pierce cancelled his weekend plans and the next day met his contact at a secret location away from Westminster and was handed a brown paper envelope. Inside was Blair's tightly typed missive. Pierce did not even look at it. He took the envelope home and read it. It was dynamite.</p> <p>On the same day a telephone call was made to Trevor Kavanagh, political editor of the Sun, asking if he would he be interested in a memo from Blair? The question didn't need asking. Never before has a Prime Minister's personal correspondence been leaked. Someone, somewhere, was attempting to destabilise the heart of Government.</p> <p>As Pierce made his way across London to the Times, Kavanagh set off for the press gallery at the House of Commons. Neither man knew what the other had got. Pierce spoke to Phil Webster, the political editor of the Times who was also at Westminster, along the corridor from Kavanagh.</p> <p>Kavanagh was told that the Times had the same story and he and Webster agreed to make one call to Campbell. Webster picked up the phone at 3.30pm, Kavanagh standing next to him. Webster gave the details. Campbell listened and said he would need to check. The line went dead. Later that afternoon, Webster's phone rang. It was Campbell. Yes, the memo was from the Prime Minister, he said flatly. The Times and the Sun started making their front pages. The Government's carefully laid plans to announce the comprehensive spending review in a blaze of positive publicity were about to be derailed.</p> <p>'This has been destabilising, no doubt,' said a senior backbencher. 'It was supposed to be our good news week, but all those issues have been clouded.'</p> <p>The devastating insight into the thinking of Blair has sparked a round of furious activity at Downing Street. Only four people were on the 'to see' list at the top of the memo: Blair, Campbell, Peter Mandelson and Gordon Brown. Sir Richard Wilson, the permanent secretary to the Cabinet, was asked to undertake a leak inquiry.</p> <p>Special Branch officers were called in and are expected to start trawling the telephone calls and emails of advisers and officials who may have had access to the memo.</p> <p>Just as Downing Street was trying to come to terms with the near paralysis caused by a mole at the heart of government, the Gould document appeared. Again, it went to Kavanagh and Pierce. Again, it was written during the late April/early May period when the Government was struggling against poor local election results and the damaging battle for the mayor of London.</p> <p>Downing Street officials began speculating that News International, which owns both papers, had been handed a job lot of memos which would slowly drip out over the succeeding weeks. The feeling of panic was rising. An NI executive described the theory as 'bollocks'.</p> <p>Deri Jones, one of the Government's top advisers on electronic security, believes that someone may have hacked into the Government's supposedly secure internet and email system, which connects not only Downing Street and Whitehall but also has links to the homes and offices of Campbell, Gould and members of the Cabinet. A security survey by Jones's company on the state of government anti-hacking measures on the web revealed shocking weaknesses. Some Labour officials are convinced that the documents were passed to the Conservative Party who then handed them out to friendly newspapers. The Tories have refused to be drawn.</p> <p>Some senior Downing Street figures believe the source of the leak will never be found; some that Gould should take a back seat or use more temperate language. Others feel Greg Cook, the party's highly respected pollster at Millbank, should be given a more central role, or that Gould should be ditched in favour of Bob Worcester, the trusted head of Mori.</p> <p>Gould has been warned about overblown language before. In 1995 his report The Unfinished Revolution was leaked to the Guardian. In it Gould said that Labour was 'unfit to govern'. It caused a row of such ferocity that Gould thought it could derail the whole New Labour project. Blair rang him and, although supportive of the direction of the memo, said the 'unfit to govern' phrase had been damaging. Could he please calm down a bit? Gould does not seem to have learned his lesson. Critics say he seems too keen on spooking Blair. It seems to have worked.</p> <p>\u0095 <b>AC, DA and GB: How to decode a Labour memo</b></p> <p>The latest leaks of memos from the heart of Government are sprinkled with initials which are baffling to the outside world. Here, we give you the cut-out-and-keep-guide to New Labour memo speak and reveal who is really who in Blair's inner circle.</p> <p>TB: Tony Blair, the Prime Minister.</p> <p>PM: Peter Mandelson, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and head, with GB, of the team planning the general election campaign.</p> <p>GB: Gordon Brown, Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p> <p>AC: Alastair Campbell, the Prime Minister's official spokesman, otherwise known as the second most powerful man in Britain.</p> <p>DA: Douglas Alexander, the MP for Paisley South and key campaign organiser. Firm ally of Brown.</p> <p>PH: Peter Hyman, Dowing Street special adviser admired for his ability to inject punchy phrases into speeches. Target of good-natured sarcasm from AC for his inability to get into Downing Street very early. Inventor of the New Labour pledge card. Agrees with PG (see below) that New Labour's brand is damaged. Arsenal supporter.</p> <p>PG: Philip Gould, memo writer and New Labour worrier. One of the archiects of the Blair project. Trusted adviser leant on heavily by TB. Disliked by Labour rank and file, distrusted by GB.</p> <p>DM: Dick Morris, former adviser to President Bill Clinton. PG loves DM's books, particularly the New Prince, which says that politicians have to 'win elections every day' not just once a week with big policy announcements.</p> <p>MCA: Married couple's allowance, tax break repealed by TB, who now thinks it makes him look anti-family.</p> <p>CF: Charlie Falconer, old friend of TB and his wife Cherie. Seen as the real Cabinet enforcer who has influence across all government departments. TB asks for his advice regularly.</p>",

The Government's carefully laid plans to announce the comprehensive spending review in a blaze of positive publicity were about to be derailed. 'This has been destabilising, no doubt,' said a senior backbencher. 'It was supposed to be our good news week, but all those issues have been clouded.' The devastating insight into the thinking of Blair has sparked a round of furious activity at Downing Street. Only four people were on the 'to see' list at the top of the memo: Blair, Campbell, Peter Mandelson and Gordon Brown. Sir Richard Wilson, the permanent secretary to the Cabinet, was asked to undertake a leak inquiry. Special Branch officers were called in and are expected to start trawling the telephone calls and emails of advisers and officials who may have had access to the memo. Just as Downing Street was trying to come to terms with the near paralysis caused by a mole at the heart of government, the Gould document appeared. Again, it went to Kavanagh and Pierce. Again, it was written during the late April/early May period when the Government was struggling against poor local election results and the damaging battle for the mayor of London. Downing Street officials began speculating that News International, which owns both papers, had been handed a job lot of memos which would slowly drip out over the succeeding weeks. The feeling of panic was rising. An NI executive described the theory as 'bollocks'. Deri Jones, one of the Government's top advisers on electronic security, believes that someone may have hacked into the Government's supposedly secure internet and email system, which connects not only Downing Street and Whitehall but also has links to the homes and offices of Campbell, Gould and members of the Cabinet. A security survey by Jones's company on the state of government anti-hacking measures on the web revealed shocking weaknesses. Some Labour officials are convinced that the documents were passed to the Conservative Party who then handed them out to friendly newspapers. The Tories have refused to be drawn. Some senior Downing Street figures believe the source of the leak will never be found; some that Gould should take a back seat or use more temperate language. Others feel Greg Cook, the party's highly respected pollster at Millbank, should be given a more central role, or that Gould should be ditched in favour of Bob Worcester, the trusted head of Mori. Gould has been warned about overblown language before. In 1995 his report The Unfinished Revolution was leaked to the Guardian. In it Gould said that Labour was 'unfit to govern'. It caused a row of such ferocity that Gould thought it could derail the whole New Labour project. Blair rang him and, although supportive of the direction of the memo, said the 'unfit to govern' phrase had been damaging. Could he please calm down a bit? Gould does not seem to have learned his lesson. Critics say he seems too keen on spooking Blair. It seems to have worked. \u0095 AC, DA and GB: How to decode a Labour memo The latest leaks of memos from the heart of Government are sprinkled with initials which are baffling to the outside world. Here, we give you the cut-out-and-keep-guide to New Labour memo speak and reveal who is really who in Blair's inner circle. TB: Tony Blair, the Prime Minister. PM: Peter Mandelson, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and head, with GB, of the team planning the general election campaign. GB: Gordon Brown, Chancellor of the Exchequer. AC: Alastair Campbell, the Prime Minister's official spokesman, otherwise known as the second most powerful man in Britain. DA: Douglas Alexander, the MP for Paisley South and key campaign organiser. Firm ally of Brown. PH: Peter Hyman, Dowing Street special adviser admired for his ability to inject punchy phrases into speeches. Target of good-natured sarcasm from AC for his inability to get into Downing Street very early. Inventor of the New Labour pledge card. Agrees with PG (see below) that New Labour's brand is damaged. Arsenal supporter. PG: Philip Gould, memo writer and New Labour worrier. One of the archiects of the Blair project. Trusted adviser leant on heavily by TB. Disliked by Labour rank and file, distrusted by GB. DM: Dick Morris, former adviser to President Bill Clinton. PG loves DM's books, particularly the New Prince, which says that politicians have to 'win elections every day' not just once a week with big policy announcements. MCA: Married couple's allowance, tax break repealed by TB, who now thinks it makes him look anti-family. CF: Charlie Falconer, old friend of TB and his wife Cherie. Seen as the real Cabinet enforcer who has influence across all government departments. TB asks for his advice regularly.",

      "bodyText": "Pakistan's deposed Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif, was sentenced to 14 years of 'rigorous imprisonment' yesterday when he was convicted in the first of several corruption trials. Sharif, who was overthrown in a coup in October, was also banned from holding public office for 21 years and fined 20 million rupees (\u00a3250,000). He is already serving two life terms for hijacking and terrorism in connection with the military takeover, and he condemned the verdict as a personal vendetta led by the military. Accountability Court judge Farrukh Latif acquitted Saifur Rehman, Sharif's own former anti-corruption chief. Rehman was also acquitted in the hijacking trial earlier this year, but faces other corruption charges. 'There is only one target in this country and that is Nawaz Sharif,' the former Prime Minister said after the brief court hearing in Attock Fort, a military compound. He was found guilty of failing to pay tax on a \u00a3600,000 Russian Mi-8 helicopter which he leased and then bought in October 1993 and used for electioneering. Sharif already enjoys 'A' class privileges in jail and the balding 50-year-old is likely to be able to avoid hard labour, despite the sentence. Lawyers for the former Prime Minister boycotted the trial but, after the hearing, Sharif claimed the helicopter had crashed before his tax returns were due and so its cost was not included. 'There was no corruption, no kickbacks, no public funds misappropriated, no embezzlement,' he said. 'But I was expecting this verdict. It has been announced by the judge but of course on behalf of somebody else. There is noth ing worth the name \"independent\" in this country.' Sharif has claimed Pakistan's military ruler, General Pervez Musharraf, has singled him and his family out for punishment since the coup. Musharraf seized power shortly after Sharif sacked him as army chief. Farouk Adam Khan, the chief prosecutor, insisted the case had been fair. 'This was a free and fair trial,' he said. Sharif is already appealing against the two life terms imposed by an anti-terrorism court earlier this year, but the government is also appealing against the sentence, arguing Sharif should face the death penalty instead. Pakistan's new military regime has pledged to tackle the country's pervasive corruption, with Sharif and his family the main target. A team from the FBI will arrive in Islamabad next month to help to train the newly established National Accountability Bureau in investigating white-collar crime. The National Accountability Bureau has broad powers of investigation and arrest and under law is allowed to hold a suspect for 90 days without charge. The former Prime Minister faces several more corruption cases based on allegations that he stole hundreds of mil lions of pounds during his two terms in power. Despite being one of Pakistan's richest men, Sharif paid no income tax in the year 1994-9'5, the accountability court heard, because he claimed all his income was from agriculture, which until now has never been taxed in Pakistan. Last week prosecutors charged him with tax evasion for failing to declare income used to buy and develop his lavish \u00a32.9 million, 100-acre family estate in Raiwind, near Lahore. The estate was purchased under the name of his mother, Shamim Akther, who together with Sharif's powerful father, Mian Mohammed Sharif, is also named in the charges. Sharif has also been charged with defaulting on bank loans given to two of his companies. He has been questioned over how he was able to buy four Park Lane apartments, which are registered to two offshore companies in the British Virgin Islands. Sharif has denied the allegations and insists he is being victimised by the military regime. But he is losing friends fast. Many in his Pakistan Muslim League party and now even his brother Shahbaz, who faces his own corruption cases, say they would rather accommodate with the army than risk confronting it. The trial was the first civilian case to be heard in the 16th-century Attock Fort, which has been used for at least three military courts- martial for attempted coups. Khan, the accountability prosecutor-general who led the case against Sharif, was jailed here for 13 months in 1973 for his part in a failed military takeover. Now the fort, which stands between Islamabad and Peshawar, is the base of the army's elite commando unit, the Special Services Group.",

I know lesbians who've been horribly hurt by their partners, but straight women don't want to hear that. In fact, they don't seem to want to hear much about the realities of lesbianism. With the opportunistic lesbian, it doesn't seem to be so much about desiring women per se as it is to do with turning away from men. Where sexual orientation is concerned, women seem to have become the floating-voter gender. After all, straight men with broken hearts don't tend to sensationally announce their imminent gayness.

The bottom line is that lesbians are all right, so long as they don't actually have sex. The obvious exception being in porn, where 'lesbians' soaping each other in bathtubs is viewed by most men as being a welcome step forward towards a more civilised and tolerant society (or something).

Bearing this in mind, the obvious losers are proper lesbians.

As I remind her, the long jump isn't getting any shorter.</p> <p>'Bye,' she says, driving off and leaving me with nothing but the three-year-old and a pile of ironing to amuse myself with. So I put the little chap in front of a double bill of Teletubbies and The Tweenies, but I've barely had a cup of tea and done the crossword and worked out how to erect the ironing board than he's hugging me round the legs and wanting his red car from the shed. Anything to stop him frothing at the mouth. But we're having so much fun, me pushing him up the hill for days on end, that by the time my wife gets home holding her jaw, it's not just the laughing gas talking when she marvels at how much progress I haven't made and wonders whether she must do everything herself!</p> <p>Do everything herself? I suppose it was the good fairy yesterday who shut the windows when it started raining and she was out gallivanting at a parents' evening?</p> <p>Still, not to be churlish and in the spirit of being a fully functioning perfect husband I volunteer to drive up to the salvage reclamation yard near Cambridge to look for something woody and characterful to replace our hideous double-glazed front entrance, which makes the house look like a bedsit-letting agency to such an extent that a woman walked in unannounced last week and deposited two suitcases in the hall. ('Er... can I help you?' asked my wife, who is hospitality personified but draws the line at allowing people to move in with us.) It all turned out to be a silly misunderstanding. The woman merely thought we were the guest cloakroom for the house next door. How we laughed!</p> <p>Anyway, it takes me ages to find this place, which is like one of those mirages that you can see from the M11 but when you get there it's turned into a pig farm.</p> <p>But at last I notice the big sign telling me what a fool I am, and sure enough just around the corner is a huge compound full of statues, which looks like a graveyard except that instead of angels with harps they've got Greek-buttocked discus throwers and goddesses of fertility discovering how difficult it is to carry a water urn and keep your breasts inside your nightie at the same time.

      "bodyText": "My wife is off to the dentist's to have herself measured up for new gums with the money I've scraped together for my tax bill, and God knows I'm not one to begrudge a close relative by marriage the full panoply of emergency orthodontic treatment that could have waited until perhaps next year, but I can't help thinking that if we are to reprioritise our finances in so highhanded a fashion perhaps I might reintroduce the notion of investing in a decent widescreen TV in time for the Olympics? As I remind her, the long jump isn't getting any shorter. 'Bye,' she says, driving off and leaving me with nothing but the three-year-old and a pile of ironing to amuse myself with. So I put the little chap in front of a double bill of Teletubbies and The Tweenies, but I've barely had a cup of tea and done the crossword and worked out how to erect the ironing board than he's hugging me round the legs and wanting his red car from the shed. Anything to stop him frothing at the mouth. But we're having so much fun, me pushing him up the hill for days on end, that by the time my wife gets home holding her jaw, it's not just the laughing gas talking when she marvels at how much progress I haven't made and wonders whether she must do everything herself! Do everything herself? I suppose it was the good fairy yesterday who shut the windows when it started raining and she was out gallivanting at a parents' evening? Still, not to be churlish and in the spirit of being a fully functioning perfect husband I volunteer to drive up to the salvage reclamation yard near Cambridge to look for something woody and characterful to replace our hideous double-glazed front entrance, which makes the house look like a bedsit-letting agency to such an extent that a woman walked in unannounced last week and deposited two suitcases in the hall. ('Er... can I help you?' asked my wife, who is hospitality personified but draws the line at allowing people to move in with us.) It all turned out to be a silly misunderstanding. The woman merely thought we were the guest cloakroom for the house next door. How we laughed! Anyway, it takes me ages to find this place, which is like one of those mirages that you can see from the M11 but when you get there it's turned into a pig farm. But at last I notice the big sign telling me what a fool I am, and sure enough just around the corner is a huge compound full of statues, which looks like a graveyard except that instead of angels with harps they've got Greek-buttocked discus throwers and goddesses of fertility discovering how difficult it is to carry a water urn and keep your breasts inside your nightie at the same time. Fantastic. There's a six-ton rhinoceros and a lifesize Apache on a horse in bronze that would look rather grand in the hall providing we removed the ceiling and front bedrooms and made the children sleep outside, though no doubt we'd then have parties of guests wandering in from next door assuming we were the Centre for Native American Studies (East Herts branch). Still, plenty of old railings, chimney pots, railway sleepers. Cow trough for the garden, sir? Nice millstone? Got one, thanks. (Unworthy joke.) I must admit I am tempted by a scary Medusa's head that you can hang on your bedroom door with a view to having a sex life that doesn't involve the children watching. But what about doors? Well, they do have some nice ones but I'm not sure stained-glass ex-cathedral jobs are entirely architecturally consonant with a 50s semi, and where would we put the doorbell?

US security sources say that the Charlotte cell was founded as a benign, if pro-Hizbollah, discussion group. However, it soon developed into a far more threatening active unit. The cell met every week to plan their operations - usually in the house of de facto leader Muhammad Youssef Hammoud and meetings involved a reading from the speeches of Ayatollah Khomeini which Hammoud downloaded from hardline Islamic websites on the Internet. Almost all those arrested are from the south Lebanon area and some charges relate to the false marriages which the group allegedly used to get into the US. None of the suspects has been charged with any terrorist activities, though Hammoud is said to have received military training from Hizbollah. According to the FBI, an informant had said that Hammoud 'would not hesitate' to carry out a terrorist act if ordered to do so.

Darwishe, who the FBI said was the brother of a 'well-known Hizbollah fighter' in Lebanon, was in charge of sending any money raised to the organisation. Hizbollah (the Party of God) is backed by Syria and Iran and was a thorn in the side of Israeli forces in southern Lebanon, being largely responsible for forcing their withdrawal after 18 years earlier this summer. The US designated Hizbollah a 'terrorist organisation' after linking it to the bombing that killed 241 US marines in Beirut in 1983 and the kidnapping of Western hostages in Lebanon. Israel has long urged the US to crack down on cells that it says are funnelling money to the organisation. But supporters of Hizbollah say that, like many Islamic organisations, its funds are used for social welfare projects and do not fund terrorism. The FBI's primary target is Osama bin Laden, the shadowy Saudi dissident based in Afghanistan, who is thought to have been behind the bombings of two American embassies in east Africa in 1998 and other attacks.

      "body": "<p>The staged row that traditionally breaks out at airshows between Boeing and Airbus about whose planes are better and who sells more of them will have a keener edge than usual this year. </p> <p>There is nothing like a new invention to add some sizzle to the proceedings. The invention in question is the A3XX 'superjumbo' under development by Europe's Airbus. At its most packed, with sardine-style economy seating throughout, this giant of the skies will be able to carry 900 people. Even carrying the average number of travellers, 550 in various classes, the aircraft leapfrogs Boeing's 400-seat 747, which has ruled the world for 30 years. </p> <p>Airbus forecasts that demand from the world's airlines will be in the order of 1,200 such aircraft in the two decades following its expected launch, in 2005. Observers estimate that at a development cost of \u00a38 billion and a price tag for airlines of \u00a3132 million per plane, Airbus will have to sell at least 350 of these leviathans. Anything less will spell financial disaster for the plane-maker. </p> <p>Ian Wild, airline analyst with stockbroker Societe Generale, said: 'Will you find enough airlines stupid enough to go and buy a thing like that?' He believes the answer is yes. If the world's airlines keep up their long record of ordering too many planes, especially too many large ones, and then slashing prices to fill them, they will queue up for the A3XX. </p> <p>This is great news for consumers, because this sort of behaviour helps bring air travel to the mass market at affordable prices, and keeps world passenger numbers growing at 5 per cent a year. But Wild says it may not be the answer for airlines' profit margins as they try to woo lucrative business travellers. Busy executives want, and are prepared to pay higher fares, for smaller jets that load and unload quickly and fly more frequently, not a behemoth leaving once a day. </p> <p>Yet if the A3XX takes off, it could be Airbus's ticket to global market leadership in civil aerospace in the future - a crushing victory for European over American ingenu ity. Airbus took 55 per cent of the orders placed last year by the world's airlines, but measured in value and in terms of total aircraft in service worldwide, Boeing has always been way ahead. </p> <p>The A3XX has been talked about for years as anything from a drawing board joke to Airbus's future golden goose. Now the consortium has finally decided to build it and is likely this week to unveil some 'launch customer' airlines which have signed up to buy it, giving the project a vital credibility boost. Airlines showing an initial interest include Middle Eastern carrier Emirates, Singapore Airlines, Qantas of Australia, the UK's Virgin and US leasing giant ILFC. </p> <p>Boeing's mission at Farnborough will be to scoff as loudly as possible at A3XX and claim it will be a flying white elephant that will squash Airbus flat when, commercially, the project falls out of the sky. It will also repeat and amplify its customary threat to sue Airbus for allegedly breaking international trade laws by taking preferential loans from partner governments to help develop the new aircraft. </p> <p>The mighty double-deck A3XX project is expected to cost between \u00a38bn and \u00a310bn, depending on how many versions Airbus builds. The UK has already pledged \u00a3500m of repayable launch aid to BAE Systems, which owns 20 per cent of Airbus and makes the wings for the aircraft. France, Germany and Spain, whose champion aerospace companies last year formed the European Aeronautic Defence and Space company (EADS) which now makes up the rest of the consortium, are also expected to stump up a total state loan package of around \u00a32.6bn. </p> <p>Chris Paxton, senior aerospace consultant with A T Kearney, says the world took a leap of faith in the late Sixties when Boeing unveiled the 747. Many thought it would be a failure but it has feathered Boeing's nest for 30 years. Now a similar extension of the imagination is required for the A3XX. And Paxton thinks Boeing, for all its bluff, probably has a new giant aircraft of its own up its sleeve. Once it has let the A3XX test the market, it will unveil it in a late bid to get back on top. </p> <p>Boeing is planning a 'stretch' version of the 747, but many observers believe that it also has a whole new A3XX-beater in a secret design bureau somewhere in its Seattle headquarters. 'Boeing will want to stay on top, but will let Airbus take the early risks,' says Paxton. </p> <p>The tension between the US and European defence and aerospace industries is not limited to civil aviation. Although the A3XX is likely to dominate the headlines at Farnborough, defence will raise equally fraught questions behind the scenes. </p> <p>The overdue consolidation of European aerospace and defence, which took its first step with the formation of EADS , has huge ramifications on both sides of the Atlantic. At the centre stands BAE, whose head John Weston is having to tread with exceeding care in Washington and in European capitals. </p> <p>At Farnborough last year Europe's consolidation was only half played out. At that stage the then British Aerospace had recently jilted its assumed German partner DaimlerChrysler Aerospace (DASA) by merging instead with GEC Marconi. </p> <p>In doing so BAE combined its airframe building expertise with electronics operations to create a \u00a312bn aerospace-defence colossus. </p> <p>DASA was not amused - its head, Jurgen Schrempp, was livid with Weston. His counter stroke came several months later with the formation of the \u00a39.6 bn EADS. At a stroke this created a combine with a turnover of 22.5bn euros, leapfrogging BAE to third spot behind US giants Boeing and Lockheed Martin. </p> <p>The game, however, was not over. The key for BAE was to capitalise on its tricky position at the crossroads of US and European defence procurement. The US wants to forge transatlantic links. </p> <p>BAE has several advantages. First, and most important, it is British. Historically close Anglo-American relations were strengthened in February when Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon and his US opposite number William Cohen signed a co-operation agreement. </p> <p>EADS is less likely to gain access to the vast $48bn US defence procurement budget and benefit from development projects coming from the $44bn spent on R&amp;D (the rest of Nato spends $8.9 bn). US-French relations are not close. </p> <p>Second, in acquiring Marconi, BAE gained the US Tracor avionics business, and Marconi North America, giving it a $2.5bn turnover toehold from which to start. </p> <p>BAE launched itself into the major league earlier this month by completing a \u00a31.1bn acquisition of the Lockheed Martin aerospace electronics business Sanders, making it the largest defence contractor in the world - ahead of US giants Lockheed, Boeing and Raytheon. Weston said the US now represented 25 per cent of the group's turnover and gave it the lead in 'information dominance', adding that BAE's success in the Sanders deal was 'an expression of confidence that the UK is a US ally'. </p> <p>Salomon Smith Barney analyst Nick Cunningham says: 'I am surprised that BAE was allowed to buy this - although regulators still have to approve the deal. It gives a very strong role in the US to BAE, but it shows that the US is as good as its word when it talks of transatlantic defence co-operation.' </p> <p>The question, in Cunningham's mind, however, is whether the move will allow BAE to become a US prime contractor. </p> <p>Andrew Brookes of the International Institute for Strategic Studies is doubtful. For example, the US government is currently deciding between Boeing and Lockheed Martin on the Joint Strike Aircraft - a navy/airforce plane. He says future projects such as the F22 fighter will be similar, although BAE will be involved at second-tier level. </p> <p>Importantly, its business will focus on the higher value elements of manufacture, but it will never be rolling planes off production lines in the US, he says. </p> <p>While looking to the US, BAE has to keep one eye on Europe, EADS and Airbus. In doing so, it has had to fight ferociously with the US to win European orders. </p> <p>The latest example was the duel with Raytheon over a \u00a31bn RAF contract for a Beyond Visual Range Air to Air Missile (BVRAAM), which it won as part of the European Meteor Consortium, comprising the Anglo-French-Italian Matra BAE Dynamics. </p> <p>At the same time Airbus's A400 transport aircraft beat Boeing's C17 - although C17s will be leased until A400s are built. </p> <p>Raytheon, and the US government, were less than pleased - Bill Clinton himself wrote at least three times to Tony Blair in an attempt to secure the order for the US. </p> <p>But the decision helped with a Blair priority - using defence policy as a means of putting the UK at the heart of Europe. </p> <p>Interestingly, Raytheon says the BVRAAM bidding is likely to increase transatlantic co-operation. Raytheon director Andy Head says: 'We are moving away from fortress Europe and Fortress US. We made it clear to an unprecedented extent during the bidding process that we were willing to co-operate if we won the deal. And the UK could be the stepping stone.' </p> <p>Nevertheless, analysts say BAE is unlikely to win missile orders in the US because of the French role in the European Matra BAE Dynamics missile consortium behind Meteor - despite protestations that impenetrable Chinese walls can be constructed. </p> <p>BAE's expertise is likely to make sure it remains an integral part of the European defence scene; EADS centres on civil activities. </p> <p>But there is a coda. French assets, including family-owned Dassault, in which EADS has a 46 per cent interest, and Thompson CSF - partly state owned, partly held by Alcatel and partly floated - have been missed in the grand consolidation. BAE is unlikely to get them, but if EADS does, the European pattern will change yet again.</p>",

Its main contents - the vast increases in spending on health and education - were conceived and leaked in panic at the time of the Budget in March. Since then a government that has no skilled plumbers left has leaked, leaked and leaked again the fact that it was planning to spend an extra \u00a340 billion a year on public services, transport and assorted other items of public expenditure. </p> <p>True there has been the usual infighting in Whitehall over marginal extra allocations of expenditure. True, also, there have been further budgetary improvements since March in revenues from higher oil prices and lower-than-expected unemployment. Thus, in later outpourings from the Government's non-plumbing department, the leaks became \u00a343bn. </p> <p>But the big figures seem to have produced a big yawn in a public fed up with leaks and talk - a public that would quite like results. </p> <p>Yet the Comprehensive Spending Review is a fascinating event.

      "bodyText": "Gordon Brown's Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR) is, superficially, something of an anti-climax. Its main contents - the vast increases in spending on health and education - were conceived and leaked in panic at the time of the Budget in March. Since then a government that has no skilled plumbers left has leaked, leaked and leaked again the fact that it was planning to spend an extra \u00a340 billion a year on public services, transport and assorted other items of public expenditure. True there has been the usual infighting in Whitehall over marginal extra allocations of expenditure. True, also, there have been further budgetary improvements since March in revenues from higher oil prices and lower-than-expected unemployment. Thus, in later outpourings from the Government's non-plumbing department, the leaks became \u00a343bn. But the big figures seem to have produced a big yawn in a public fed up with leaks and talk - a public that would quite like results. Yet the Comprehensive Spending Review is a fascinating event. In macro-economic terms it is both pre-Keynesian and (I confess I normally have an aversion to 'post' phrases) post-Keynesian. It is pre-Keynesian because, almost like an inter-war chancellor under the iron grip of Montagu Norman (only in this instance it was his own personal grip) Brown felt the money had to be earned before it could be spent. The credit and borrowing mechanism may lie at the heart of the modern capitalist economy, but for Honest Gordon it was to be Prudence first and Purpose later. True, the Government made a dog's breakfast of welfare reform, so the way in which it was prudent had to be adapted as it went along. It then turned to means-testing in a big way - something that sounded alarm bells in Old Labour England and, when it comes to things like widows' pensions, may yet worry Middle England - or, more to the point perhaps, Lower Middle England. But the principal reason for the Treasury's finances continuing to improve (because, let's face it: the improvement began under Norman Lamont and continued under Kenneth Clarke's admirable growth policies) has been the buoyancy of the economy. Some serious long-term 'structural' reforms may or may not have taken place - one never quite knows until years later, as Lord Lawson will testify - but the economic cycle has performed wonders for the Budgetary position. So the Chancellor can happily boast that unemployment, social security and debt interest now account collectively for 17 per cent of public spending, as opposed to 42 per cent a few years ago. A government that said it did not believe in 'tax and spend' has raised the revenue in various ways, and is now happily embarking on the 'spend'. Which brings us to the post-Keynesian nature of the Comprehensive Spending Review. As was clear in the Financial Statement that accompanied the Budget, the Chancellor was planning to raise public spending by a cumulative \u00a340bn a year over three years. Extra revenues made this \u00a343bn. The indispensably independent Insti tute for Fiscal Studies estimates that public spending will in fact be \u00a350bn a year higher at the end of the period. These are truly amazing figures. It is the biggest 'Keynesian' injection into a European economy since the reunification of Germany after 1989, and possibly since the Marshall Plan of the late Forties. A Treasury that says it no longer believes in short-term demand management - ex cept via the Bank of England's alterations in the interest rate - is planning to inject up to the equivalent of 5 per cent of gross domestic product a year into the economy over the medium term. It is obvious that such an ambitious strategy is needed to redress the extraordinary imbalance in this country between those old Galbraithian friends, private affluence and public squalor. But when you also think of the strategic need for the pound to come down to save large sectors of manufacturing from bankruptcy, and therefore the need to divert resources into exports, the implications for consumers - for which read electors - ought to be clear: consumption cannot continue apace in an economy which, until very recently, the Monetary Policy Committee feared was overheating. Of course, the real spending does not get under way until next year - widely assumed to be election year. There is quite a debate going on inside the MPC about the likely course of the economy and of interest rates between now and then. But we may find that this sequence of pre- and post-Keynesianism pro duces some interesting results. I have no doubt that, having - unnecessarily, in my opinion - been seriously frugal with the nation's finances until now, the Chancellor would be dourly happy to see the MPC impose a period of austerity on the consumer, in order to do something about public squalor - but not until after the election. The fundamental problem is that British economic policy continues to be prone to dogmatic lurches: lean years for the public sector are to be followed by fat years, and a lot of damage has been inflicted on the way. Indeed, public spending has been so depressed that, even with the planned spree, it will be nothing like as high a proportion of gross national product as it was under past Conservative governments, let alone in most Continental countries. It will nevertheless be quite a lurch - and quite a spree. In effect, last week's public spending announcement constitutes some 75 per cent of Labour's next manifesto.

But just when I thought I could announce Christmas in July, The Observer came into possession of a 12-page document from Argentina. </p> <p>It appears to have originated in the Office of the United States Trade Representative in Geneva (which does not deny the document's authenticity). The official missive threatens Argentina for opening its borders to the drugs trade - not the fun stuff, but sales of legal, licensed medicines. If Argentina does not end its commitment to free cross-border trade in pharmaceuticals, said the Trade Rep, America would keep the nation on the Section 301 Watch List - a kind of Death Row for trading partners. </p> <p>If you read the gospels of globalisation apostles Paul Krugman or Thomas Friedman, you could get the impression that the World Trade Organisation is all about ending tariffs and trade barriers. Only in your dreams. </p> <p>In the real world, the WTO is the mechanism for privatising the tariff system. Once, countries protected their workers and local industry behind taxes at national borders. In the New World Trade Order, global corpora tions may demand levies against nations that sell or buy products outside the zones they have marked out by brand names and market segments. The WTO's penal system for prohibited importing and exporting goes under the psychedelic title Trips (for Trade-related Intellectual Property Rights). </p> <p>Trip-ping, Argentina and Africa - it all fits together. The story begins with this un-fun fact: one in four people in black Africa is going to die of Aids unless medicine arrives now. Luckily, Brazil, India and, most aggressively, Argentina, can make the drugs dirt-cheap and ship them to the dying. But US, British and Swiss pharmaceuticals giants howled out loud about the proposed cross-shipments. </p> <p>The US trade cops, led by Vice-President Al Gore, backed Big Pharma and halted the life-saving plan - Nelson Mandela's pleas, Nobel Prize and flowered shirts notwithstanding. </p> <p>Unfortunately for Gore the presidential candidate, his let-them-eat-aspirin policies resulted in his every campaign stop attracting packs of enraged homosexuals who hollered about his killing more Africans than Michael Caine in Zulu. This did not make for good TV for Al. So his good buddy President Bill found a few billion to quell the restless natives. </p> <p>However, the billions come with strings attached or, more accurately, chains and manacles. South Africa must buy 100 per cent of the medicine from the USA and pay back all the cash at 'commercial interest rates'. </p> <p>The US Trade Rep's billet-doux to Argentina is the supply side of this scheme to stop South Africa breaking the de facto embargo on free trade in pharmaceuticals. South Africa hoped to use a loophole in Trips that permits the import of patent drugs in extreme emergencies, even without the patent-holder's approval. </p> <p>Initially, the US retaliated against South Africa by taxing some of its imports to the US - until the anti-Gore demos. The Trade Rep document suggests that the Clinton Administration will re-aim the sanctions missiles at Argentina, thereby avoiding the impolitic Mandela imagery while cutting off South Africa's supply at source. </p> <p>After an expected WTO show trial, Argentina's economy will be hung from a pole in Geneva as an example for India and Brazil, other potential exporters. </p> <p>Maybe I'm not being fair. After all, Trips seeks to protect and compensate manufacturers for their risky investments and inventiveness in creating medicines such as AZT, Glaxo-Wellcome's anti-Aids drug. </p> <p>Glaxo was inventive, all right, but not in discovering AZT. A Professor Jerome Horowitz synthesised the drug in 1964, under a grant from the US government's National Institutes of Health (NIH). A Glaxo unit bought the formula to use on pet cats. </p> <p>In 1984, an NIH lab discovered the HIV virus. The government lab urgently asked drugmakers to send samples of every anti-retrovirus drug on their shelves. NIH spent millions inventing a method to test these compounds. When the tests showed AZT killed the virus, the government asked Glaxo, as the compound's owner, to conduct lab tests. </p> <p>Glaxo refused. You can't blame it. HIV could contaminate labs, even kill researchers. So NIH's Dr Hiroaki Mitsuya, combining brilliance, bravery and loads of public cash, performed the difficult proofs on live virus. In February 1985, NIH told Glaxo the good news and asked the company to conduct human trials. </p> <p>Glaxo refused again. Here's where Glaxo got inventive. Within days of the notice, the company filed a patent in Britain for its 'discovery'. Glaxo failed to mention the US government work. </p> <p>But Glaxo has a heart. The Anglo-American behemoth announced it would sell South Africa an AZT-based drug for only $2 a day per patient, more than 75 per cent off the price charged in the America and Europe. I called Glaxo USA to say thanks but, after a few questions, it became clear that the $2 price merely matched the Brazilian/Argentine prices. </p> <p>Think about that. If $2 is the free-market price, Europeans and Americans pay 400 per cent over the odds, price discrimination explicitly protected by Trips. </p> <p>That's the funny thing about the WTO's expansion of so-called intellectual property rights. It is sold in the West on the slick line that those people, the dark, unindustrious tribes of the southern hemisphere, are trying to steal our inventions. </p> <p>In fact, says expert Jamie Love of the Consumer Project on Technology in Washington, patients in the West have as much to lose as Africans under the new regime of thought ownership. </p> <p>This came to Love graphically when Maude Jones, a 30-year-old London woman, called him begging help to obtain Taxol. The drug could have controlled her breast cancer, but her NHS region did not prescribe it because of its stratospheric cost. </p> <p>There is no patent on Taxol. The US government discovered it. But Bristol-Myers Squibb, because it performed minor work calculating dosage levels, holds the intellectual property rights on dose-related data, even though the data was originally collected by govern ment. Under Britain's data protection laws this gave Bristol-Myers Squibb lock-up control on Taxol in the UK for 10 years even without a patent. </p> <p>Bristol-Myers Squibb takes no chances with its cancer monopoly. Taxol comes from the yew tree. While Western drug companies have long argued that rainforest trees and plants are theirs for the taking without paying royalties, Bristol-Myers Squibb obtained from Congress the exclusive right to harvest yew trees on US government lands, about the only place it grows on the planet.

BA is likely to decide in early August whether to walk away or continue talking. If it presses on with negotiations, senior executives are likely to indicate to Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott that it will not object if the Government concedes open skies to the Americans. A source close to the airline said: 'We can conceive of it. It would be quite a relief in many ways - it has gone on for so long. It has to happen some time, and it would be nice to clear it out of the way and get on with the business of facing the competition.' The UK and US are closer than they have been for 10 years to signing a deal to liberalise the heavily restricted transatlantic market. Prescott and US transport secretary Rodney Slater are keen to sign a deal before the Clinton administration comes to an end this November. Talks between the two sides resume in September.",

Some of the questions to be studied will be the price-setting mechanisms, the supply chains, whether there are many or just a few participants in each market, whether gangs concentrate on one drug or several and the barriers to entering and leaving markets. The new way of thinking about the international drug cartels has already been discussed by Home Secretary Jack Straw and Janet Reno, the US attorney-general. Influenced by the ideas of British drug tsar Keith Hellawell, the plan is expected to inform the design of legislation and work in tandem with the Prime Minister's domestic agenda on drugs, which is expected to be highlighted by a new Bill on the subject in the Queen's Speech.",

But yesterday he issued a statement saying: 'Owing to the great unhappiness this has caused my farm staff and family, we are withdrawing any claim for damages caused to our crops.'</p> <p>As well as being vilified by the press, the farmer's original claim was condemned by the Payne family, who said they were 'appalled'. Police said they were left 'open-mouthed'. Langmead had claimed that any money would be donated to the Sarah Payne fund, but despite this the National Farmers Union said it would not back his claim under the present circumstances. Earlier Langmead had issued a statement, which read: 'I am very upset that someone with Sussex police has seen fit to publicise the fact that I notified the police of damage to crops on my farm in the course of the search for Sarah Payne. I and my farm staff have been deeply distressed by the tragic disappearance and murder of Sarah.</p> <p>'However, we cannot afford to ignore the fact that, through no fault of the police, many thousands of pounds of damage has been done to our crops during the course of searches for Sarah...'</p> <p>News of the farmer's retreat came as detectives investigating the murder began to examine the possibility that the killer may have discarded items of Sarah's clothing over a wide area in a bid to confuse or taunt police. They have so far failed to find more clothing or other forensic evidence.</p> <p>Sarah's naked body was found in a field close to Pul borough. It was believed to have been hidden in the early hours of 2 July but was not discovered until 17 July. Her shoe was found on 20 July.</p> <p>Detectives believe that, after snatching Sarah from a lane close to the coast at Kingston, near Littlehampton, her killer travelled north, most likely using the A24 before turning west along the A272 to Coolham before heading south again on the A29. Her body was found beside this road. Or he could have travelled in the opposite direction.</p> <p>All the lanes below the A272 and between the A29 and A24 were being subjected to intense searches when her shoe was found by a member of the public near Coolham. Motorists are being questioned at roadblocks by police hoping to garner clues from day-trippers returning to the area.</p> <p>Police were also to continue inquiries near a property in Crawley, West Sussex, where a Littlehampton man arrested in connection with the inquiry was staying after he was released on police bail until August.</p>",

But yesterday he issued a statement saying: 'Owing to the great unhappiness this has caused my farm staff and family, we are withdrawing any claim for damages caused to our crops.' As well as being vilified by the press, the farmer's original claim was condemned by the Payne family, who said they were 'appalled'. Police said they were left 'open-mouthed'. Langmead had claimed that any money would be donated to the Sarah Payne fund, but despite this the National Farmers Union said it would not back his claim under the present circumstances. Earlier Langmead had issued a statement, which read: 'I am very upset that someone with Sussex police has seen fit to publicise the fact that I notified the police of damage to crops on my farm in the course of the search for Sarah Payne. I and my farm staff have been deeply distressed by the tragic disappearance and murder of Sarah. 'However, we cannot afford to ignore the fact that, through no fault of the police, many thousands of pounds of damage has been done to our crops during the course of searches for Sarah...' News of the farmer's retreat came as detectives investigating the murder began to examine the possibility that the killer may have discarded items of Sarah's clothing over a wide area in a bid to confuse or taunt police. They have so far failed to find more clothing or other forensic evidence. Sarah's naked body was found in a field close to Pul borough. It was believed to have been hidden in the early hours of 2 July but was not discovered until 17 July. Her shoe was found on 20 July. Detectives believe that, after snatching Sarah from a lane close to the coast at Kingston, near Littlehampton, her killer travelled north, most likely using the A24 before turning west along the A272 to Coolham before heading south again on the A29. Her body was found beside this road. Or he could have travelled in the opposite direction. All the lanes below the A272 and between the A29 and A24 were being subjected to intense searches when her shoe was found by a member of the public near Coolham. Motorists are being questioned at roadblocks by police hoping to garner clues from day-trippers returning to the area. Police were also to continue inquiries near a property in Crawley, West Sussex, where a Littlehampton man arrested in connection with the inquiry was staying after he was released on police bail until August.",

They had arrested 12 people at the house, some white, some black, and put us all in the same police station. As people were getting interviewed, they'd come back and discuss what was going on.

It seemed obvious.'</p> <p>But the police produced a man who claimed to have stolen a car used in the robbery and passed it to Rowe.

At least the blood congealing on the tarmac proved that his groundhog was freshly killed. And that makes a big difference when you are selling roadkill.</p> <p>Liberia is not a wealthy place. Neighbouring Sierra Leone is supposed to be the poorest place in the world, but Liberia must run it close. When there's a thriving market for run-over rodent, you know a country is in trouble.</p> <p>Liberia has been in trouble for a long time. The brutal civil war that tore it apart in the Nineties is over, but the legacy of nearly 200 years of misrule is apparent. The markets are full of shoddy goods and wizened vegetables - which no one buys; the hotels are full of whores, arms dealers and diamond traders - whom no one regulates; the corridors of power are full of ex-killers and conmen - whom no one is likely to depose soon. Along with roadkill, monkey is a common source of meat. Most livestock was eaten long ago.</p> <p>But there's no shortage at the Mambo Point Hotel. The shady wheeler-dealers, the United Nations consultants and, indeed, the visiting journalists who pay their $110 a night for air-conditioning and hot water, expect a decent club sandwich and steak and chips. But the hotel's location makes up for the company. If you can see past the leather stetsons of the American diamond dealers and the pot-bellies of the South African 'freelance military advisers', then you'll make out a wonderful view: the long, steady swell of the Atlantic, as grey as the North Sea under a sky thick with rain. Sweeping round the bay lies the battered, shell-pocked city of Monrovia which, in the early morning, emerges from the mist like an old boxer coming down to breakfast after a night's drinking.</p> <p>Next to the hotel is an old colonial mansion, set back on a rise above the rubbish-strewn beach. The faces of the two stone lions that flank the 30-step staircase leading to the main entrance have been worn smooth by 150 years of storms and spray. The house was built by one of Liberia's first grandees - the descendants of slaves freed from their plantations in America and shipped to West Africa by philanthropists in 1822.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the do-gooders forgot that plenty of people already lived along the 'slave coast'. When the freed slaves landed, they enthusiastically started replicating the lifestyle of their erstwhile masters. They built houses like those of the plantation owners they once worked for. They developed women's fashions - long dresses with ruffles and frills - based on that of the Southern gentry. And, most ironic of all, they set about enslaving the indigenous population.</p> <p>The house next to the Mambo Point Hotel - it is known as the Webah Hospital locally, as it once housed Monrovia's terminally ill - is home to around 200 people. At the foot of the steps is a shack made of bamboo and planks of wood. It's here that the men gather to drink beer, if they can afford it, and smoke fabulously potent local ganja, when they can't.</p> <p>The school holidays are on, so a horde of ragged children in oversized flip-flops runs up and down the steps, playing football and shrieking.</p> <p>Jakey David stands watching the children play. His own family - seven strong - live in a single room in the house. For that he pays 700 Liberian dollars - around \u00a315 - a month. 'It's an injustice,' he says. 'It keeps the rain out, but there is nothing else. There are always tribulations.' Jakey makes his living washing the bright, white, luxury Landcruisers that the diplomats and the aid workers drive. But now it is the rainy season there is little demand for his services.</p> <p>Inside the house it is very dark and there is a smell of unwashed bodies and old fat. Water comes from a nearby stream and is boiled up on charcoal braziers by women wrapped in colourful if faded lengths of printed cotton.</p> <p>Tony is a sharp 17-year-old. But for his mournful eyes he would be the classic teenage hustler. He brought us up to the house, past the faceless lions and a ferocious dog, and guided us through its labyrinthine floors. He wants to earn money to go back to school, so we give him a fistful of Liberian dollars and ask him about his plans. His brown eyes grow deeper, wider and sadder than ever. 'Just keep moving,' he says. 'Just keep moving.'</p>",

Along with roadkill, monkey is a common source of meat. Most livestock was eaten long ago. But there's no shortage at the Mambo Point Hotel. The shady wheeler-dealers, the United Nations consultants and, indeed, the visiting journalists who pay their $110 a night for air-conditioning and hot water, expect a decent club sandwich and steak and chips. But the hotel's location makes up for the company. If you can see past the leather stetsons of the American diamond dealers and the pot-bellies of the South African 'freelance military advisers', then you'll make out a wonderful view: the long, steady swell of the Atlantic, as grey as the North Sea under a sky thick with rain. Sweeping round the bay lies the battered, shell-pocked city of Monrovia which, in the early morning, emerges from the mist like an old boxer coming down to breakfast after a night's drinking. Next to the hotel is an old colonial mansion, set back on a rise above the rubbish-strewn beach. The faces of the two stone lions that flank the 30-step staircase leading to the main entrance have been worn smooth by 150 years of storms and spray. The house was built by one of Liberia's first grandees - the descendants of slaves freed from their plantations in America and shipped to West Africa by philanthropists in 1822. Unfortunately, the do-gooders forgot that plenty of people already lived along the 'slave coast'. When the freed slaves landed, they enthusiastically started replicating the lifestyle of their erstwhile masters. They built houses like those of the plantation owners they once worked for. They developed women's fashions - long dresses with ruffles and frills - based on that of the Southern gentry. And, most ironic of all, they set about enslaving the indigenous population. The house next to the Mambo Point Hotel - it is known as the Webah Hospital locally, as it once housed Monrovia's terminally ill - is home to around 200 people. At the foot of the steps is a shack made of bamboo and planks of wood. It's here that the men gather to drink beer, if they can afford it, and smoke fabulously potent local ganja, when they can't. The school holidays are on, so a horde of ragged children in oversized flip-flops runs up and down the steps, playing football and shrieking. Jakey David stands watching the children play. His own family - seven strong - live in a single room in the house. For that he pays 700 Liberian dollars - around \u00a315 - a month. 'It's an injustice,' he says. 'It keeps the rain out, but there is nothing else. There are always tribulations.' Jakey makes his living washing the bright, white, luxury Landcruisers that the diplomats and the aid workers drive. But now it is the rainy season there is little demand for his services. Inside the house it is very dark and there is a smell of unwashed bodies and old fat. Water comes from a nearby stream and is boiled up on charcoal braziers by women wrapped in colourful if faded lengths of printed cotton. Tony is a sharp 17-year-old. But for his mournful eyes he would be the classic teenage hustler. He brought us up to the house, past the faceless lions and a ferocious dog, and guided us through its labyrinthine floors. He wants to earn money to go back to school, so we give him a fistful of Liberian dollars and ask him about his plans. His brown eyes grow deeper, wider and sadder than ever. 'Just keep moving,' he says. 'Just keep moving.'",

He was 22, dissatisfied with his studies at Oxford and having doubts about his planned military career. He was impressed by German students and their arguments against the Versailles Treaty, and wrote to his parents detailing the restrictions it placed on the lives of his new friends. 'England is no democracy and Germany far from being a totalitarian state,' he wrote.</p> <p>His nephew said: 'Jock very quickly began to despair of Britain and France's attitude towards Germany.

Lewes first visited Germany in the summer of 1935, on a cycling trip. He was 22, dissatisfied with his studies at Oxford and having doubts about his planned military career. He was impressed by German students and their arguments against the Versailles Treaty, and wrote to his parents detailing the restrictions it placed on the lives of his new friends. 'England is no democracy and Germany far from being a totalitarian state,' he wrote. His nephew said: 'Jock very quickly began to despair of Britain and France's attitude towards Germany. He disagreed with the democratic powers that enabled them to openly criticise the Nazis whom he saw working to improve the lives of his friends.' When Lewes returned to England two months later, he brought with him a Hitler Youth knife. The following year he organised a visit with his rowing fraternity to the Berlin Olympic Games. He wrote letters home singing the praises of Germany and refused to back his rowing group's anti-Nazi activities. 'My uncle fell for the grandeur, the permanency and respectability of the new regime and failed to notice or criticise the encroaching anti-Semitic tendencies of the era,' said his nephew. 'Jock was absolutely besotted by his Nazi girlfriend and was flirting with the Socialist way. He was aware that there was propaganda around intended to dazzle him but he was seriously taken with the ideas of the Nazi party too.' In 1938 Jock Lewes attended a ball attended by Hitler and Goebbels. 'My uncle shook hands with Nazis who almost certainly had blood under their fingernails, and he did so before the blood was dry,' said his nephew. He wrote to his parents that England had 'backed the wrong horse in the First World War' and criticised England's politicians, calling them 'braying parliamentarians'. His loyalty to Germany continued until November 1938, when Kristallnacht forced him to realise the real objectives of the Nazi party. 'I have been struggling to believe or rather retain my belief in German sincerity but only a fanatic faith could withstand the evidence they choose of their own free will to put before us,' he wrote to his parents. 'I have great faith in Britain and I swear I will not live to see the day when Britain hauls down the colours of her beliefs before totalitarian aggression.' Lewes's disillusionment with Germany turned to bitterness. He broke off all contact with his fianc\u00e9e. 'I shall willingly take up arms against Germany, almost gladly,' he wrote. In 1940, Jock travelled to the Middle East and, along with Stirling, Paddy Mayne and Georges Berg\u00e9, founded the SAS. He died in Libya at the end of 1941 following a daring operation. Former SAS sergeant and author Andy McNab admitted he had never heard about Lewes's flirtation with Nazi Germany. 'This is going to be a bit of a shock for a lot of people,' he said.

      "bodyText": "Betty Boothroyd's decision to step down as an MP and as Speaker of the Commons has prompted a bitter struggle for her seat, pitting Blair's Babes against the male-dominated Labour bureaucracy. Women MPs are determined that a female should inherit her plum seat as a signal of Labour's seriousness about feminising Parliament. Valerie Vaz, sister of the Foreign Office Minister, Keith, is the leading female contender to emerge so far for the West Bromwich West seat, and Labour's Millbank headquarters is seeking others. But Vaz will face a stiff challenge from the unions' 'favoured son', Tom Watson, the well-liked political officer of the AEEU, who is close to several New Labour movers and shakers. The battle for Boothroyd's successor is heightened not only because it will be a high-profile by-election, but because fewer than one in six of those new Labour candidates so far selected for the next general election is a woman, the same figure as for the Tories, once decried by the Left as sexist. One Labour Party source said: 'Given the difficulties we are having getting women for Labour seats, here is a chance for the NEC to put their money where their mouth is. 'The normal run of constituency selections are not turning up women. This would be a very good way of sending a signal - Betty is one of the most celebrated women in British politics, and a worthy successor might well be another woman.' Harriet Harman, the ex-Minister who recently produced a pamphlet on women voters, said: 'The evidence we have found is overwhelmingly that women voters don't think it is fair if only men are in Parliament. They want more women MPs. 'Clearly there is discrimination going on, as nobody can say that the women don't want to be selected or are not as good. At the moment it is not a meritocracy, and we have to redress that.' The mass influx of 101 'Blair Babes' in 1997 was fuelled by all-women shortlists forcing constituencies to pick females, but these were then ruled unlawful on sex discrimination grounds. This time round, out of 104 new selections - seats where the MP is standing down or there is no sitting Labour MP - only 16 are women, while the Tories have picked 44 women out of 280. Not all seats have selected. Although the Tories could still boast only a handful of female MPs, even if all their best female contenders got in, Harman believes it is not enough for Labour to compare itself to their historically-poor record. Meanwhile, according to calculations made by women MPs and passed on to Sally Morgan, the Prime Minister's political secretary, heavy losses in the next election would sway gender balance back towards men. If Labour's majority is cut by fewer than 80 seats, proportionally more men would disappear than women. But if up to 120 seats were lost, it could end up with a ratio of one woman MP to every four men, compared with the current one woman to every three. Boothroyd, who will this week make her farewell speech to the Commons, is stepping down in October.",

The insidious advance of potentially fatal, antibiotic-resistant superbugs, such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and the flesh-eating bug that causes necrotising fasciitis, has led scientists to look elsewhere for treatments. 'These results demonstrate that the application of sterile maggots can remove dead and festering tissue more effectively than conventional medicines, enabling the wounds to heal safely while eliminating MRSA from wounds that have failed to respond to other treatments,' said Stephen Thomas, director of the biosurgical research unit at the Surgical Materials Testing Laboratory at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend, Wales, the only commercial facility producing sterile fly larvae in Britain. 'Maggots eat pus, infections, bacteria and rotting flesh while avoiding healthy flesh altogether,' he said. But because larval therapy is not on the list of drugs and treatments which GPs can prescribe, it is not available to patients in the community. The therapy could save the NHS up to \u00a32 million a year. Links www.tvs.org.uk For the Tissue Viability Society's website. www.smtl.co.uk For the Surgical Materials Testing Laboratory.",

Jeremiah was one of the first people in Zambia to declare publicly that he is HIV-positive, which was incredibly brave. Even though one in five Zambians have contracted HIV, there is a massive stigma attached to it and the illness is draining the country of its human resources. Women are compromised by Zambia's poverty and cultural gender divides, usually unable to say no to sex and often with nothing to sell but their bodies.

He strings out these great stories to explain how Zambians get into trouble without safe sex, which leaves us with tears streaming down our faces. What I find so special about Jeremiah is his ability to laugh at himself - even at his illness. </p> <p> When he found out he had TB last year, he found he couldn't tell anybody because it's often a quintessential sign of full-blown Aids. He came to see me and said, 'I can't believe what I've just done. I can tell the whole world I am HIV-positive but I can't tell them I've got TB'. And he stood there and he laughed. And then he went right out and started telling everybody the truth. </p> <p> Jeremiah was diagnosed with HIV six years ago and it's hard to know whether he has Aids or not. He has survived longer than most sufferers because he works hard at staying healthy and is trying to develop himself as a role model.

Then one sunny day in April 1999, I was discharged from hospital (bent double by the scar) with a sleeping newborn in my arms. As we sped towards home in the back of a minicab, I realised with horror that I knew nothing about babies. I loved my nieces and nephews, of course, but not enough to change their nappies. I knew a few other mothers - but we'd never discussed the details of their days. For how long and how often should Ruby feed? When and where should she sleep? What happens if she wants to nap through the day and party the night away?</p> <p>The advice from my health worker was reassuringly simple: 'Whatever.' The latest books from the Baby Gurus (Miriam Stoppard, Penelope Leach, the NCT) followed the same line. Whatever your baby wants. Feed on demand is the current vogue. Three in a bed is the in thing. Sleep when your baby does. Throw out the clock. Go with the flow... and don't even think about routine.</p> <p>This is largely a backlash against the bad old days of baby care when mothers were instructed to put their babies on a rota. Feeds were every four hours regardless of hunger, babies slept alone in cots, and there was no harm in leaving the pram at the bottom of the garden if you wanted a few hours' peace. Today, this is tantamount to child abuse. Fitting your baby to a schedule, withholding food, forcing sleep in a darkened nursery will teach terror and isolation. Babies are not clockwork toys; they are quirky little people whose needs change hour to hour, day to day, night to night, whim by whim. So for the first year at least, it's goodbye to order, goodbye to unbroken sleep and goodbye to your life.</p> <p>But does it have to be this way? Absolutely not, says Gina Ford, one of the world's top maternity nurses, who's waging a one-woman war against current thinking. Recently set in a ferocious head-to-head with the sweet Dr Miriam Stoppard on the Today programme, followed by hot debates in the press, Gina is currently making headlines as a hard-hearted, no-nonsense baby bully who believes that all little ones should be 'left to cry'.</p> <p>This really misses the point. In fact, the opposite is the case. If you follow her advice, she claims, your baby will hardly cry at all. Having built a career tending to more than 300 newborns of the very rich and often famous (royalty, rock stars, actors), Gina has never failed to get her babies sleeping through the night within weeks of the birth - without a fight. None has ever had colic. They hardly ever cry. They eat well and sleep deeply.</p> <p>Gina believes the reason for this is simple, and it all boils down to one - forbidden - word: routine. Last summer, her formula was set out in astonishing detail (with precise times for waking, napping, playing, feeding, adjusted every few weeks) and published by Vermilion ( The Contented Little Baby Book , \u00a37.99). With little publicity and no promotion, her timetables have walked off the shelves and now divide mothers across the land. The internet hosts some of the debate where comments range from 'Nothing short of miraculous' and 'Brilliant'. 'For a happy baby that sleeps like a dream' to 'Put quite simply, this book encourages damaging, abusive behaviour towards babies'.</p> <p>Shortly to be published in America by Penguin, Gina is now finishing off her second, a trouble-shooting book from birth to three years (for the mothers who failed to heed her advice first time round and now have toddlers who are fretful, milkaholic insomniacs). There is also a website and a TV series on the way, Gina's Babies , featuring Gina working her magic on troubled households across the country (a kind of Barbara Woodhouse meets Ground Force on babies).</p> <p>Despite her recent run-in with Miriam, Gina believes that times are changing. 'Ten years ago, it was like working for the Secret Service,' says Gina, a large, laughing middle-aged lady from the Scottish borders who fell into the baby business while nannying as a student. 'All these desperate mothers were asking me to sort out their baby's sleep problems. What they meant was \"could I get their baby into a routine\", but we never used that word. It's only in the last few years that I've felt able to stand up and say, \"I believe in routines.\" Because I've seen the consequences of not having one.'</p> <p>Which isn't to say Gina supports the old four-hourly regime, either. 'I noticed a long time ago that it didn't suit babies' natural rhythms,' she says. So Gina started recording when her babies were tired, when they were hungry, when they were wide awake. 'It's been a gradual progression, but I'd say it's only in the last eight years that my routines have become perfect,' she says. 'For example, all young babies get sleepy within two hours of being awake - so they must be able to nap regularly. But if they are then allowed to sleep all day, they won't want to be put down and left at night. It's common sense.'</p> <p>Feed times should be equally structured, says Gina, who believes 'colic' - that mystery curse which causes some babies to scream through the evening - is simply a result of feeding too often, and not leaving time to digest. Breastfed babies given constant 'top ups' will take lots of foremilk feeds (the watery stuff that comes first and whizzes through the system) and not enough hind-milk (which comes after a good long suck and is five time fattier and more filling).</p> <p>This all sounded sensible enough, when I first read Gina's book (as Ruby suckled away at my breast for the 10th time in two hours). But back then, my girl was just eight weeks old, and I felt violently opposed to Gina's central premise that my special angel, who had good days and bad days, sleepy days and play days, was actually a clockwork toy who ran to the same rhythms as all the other babies on this planet. (How could she, when she was far more alert/ advanced/intelligent than any other?).</p> <p>So I ditched the book and towed the lovable, liberal line. If Ruby cried, down came the bra. When she slept through the afternoon, we tiptoed round the house. If she was wide awake at 1am, my husband and I did shifts.</p> <p>Two months later, we were all bleary-eyed basket cases. I can't recall when I decided to change tack. Perhaps it was the night Ruby woke me five times for a quick slurp. Or when I woke up myself, and practically choked trying to suppress a cough because I didn't want to disturb the sleeping princess slumped across my stomach.</p> <p>In any case, at some point, I wanted a baby who didn't seem hungry all the time, who wasn't either over-tired or not nearly tired enough, and who (most importantly) slept through the night in her own room.</p> <p>Back came the book, and slowly, gingerly, we tried easing Ruby in a more Gina-ly direction. By the time she was five months old, I had become (and remain) a routine freak, a tyrannical clockwatcher, a woman obsessed, a Gina Junky.</p> <p>Other mothers look puzzled when I rush home for Ruby's lunchtime nap, and can't understand why I don't take her to dinner parties. (In the days when supermodels take their babies to premi\u00e8res, it's not very 21st century to leave yours at home with the sitter.) But the rewards are obvious. Ruby is happy and bright, she naps twice a day, sleeps through the night and wakes in the morning singing. She is capable of making my least broody friends re-evaluate.</p> <p>'Why is Ruby so sweet? Do you think it's nature or nurture?' one asked recently. Actually, I think it's because rather than letting a tiny baby dictate an ever-changing pattern, I set one for her. In other words, it's down to a seven-letter word beginning with 'r' - or a four letter word beginning with 'g'. But of course, I didn't tell my friend that. 'Nature or nurture? A bit of both,' I replied, looking smug.</p>",

Last summer, her formula was set out in astonishing detail (with precise times for waking, napping, playing, feeding, adjusted every few weeks) and published by Vermilion ( The Contented Little Baby Book , \u00a37.99). With little publicity and no promotion, her timetables have walked off the shelves and now divide mothers across the land. The internet hosts some of the debate where comments range from 'Nothing short of miraculous' and 'Brilliant'. 'For a happy baby that sleeps like a dream' to 'Put quite simply, this book encourages damaging, abusive behaviour towards babies'. Shortly to be published in America by Penguin, Gina is now finishing off her second, a trouble-shooting book from birth to three years (for the mothers who failed to heed her advice first time round and now have toddlers who are fretful, milkaholic insomniacs). There is also a website and a TV series on the way, Gina's Babies , featuring Gina working her magic on troubled households across the country (a kind of Barbara Woodhouse meets Ground Force on babies). Despite her recent run-in with Miriam, Gina believes that times are changing. 'Ten years ago, it was like working for the Secret Service,' says Gina, a large, laughing middle-aged lady from the Scottish borders who fell into the baby business while nannying as a student. 'All these desperate mothers were asking me to sort out their baby's sleep problems. What they meant was \"could I get their baby into a routine\", but we never used that word. It's only in the last few years that I've felt able to stand up and say, \"I believe in routines.\" Because I've seen the consequences of not having one.' Which isn't to say Gina supports the old four-hourly regime, either. 'I noticed a long time ago that it didn't suit babies' natural rhythms,' she says. So Gina started recording when her babies were tired, when they were hungry, when they were wide awake. 'It's been a gradual progression, but I'd say it's only in the last eight years that my routines have become perfect,' she says. 'For example, all young babies get sleepy within two hours of being awake - so they must be able to nap regularly. But if they are then allowed to sleep all day, they won't want to be put down and left at night. It's common sense.' Feed times should be equally structured, says Gina, who believes 'colic' - that mystery curse which causes some babies to scream through the evening - is simply a result of feeding too often, and not leaving time to digest. Breastfed babies given constant 'top ups' will take lots of foremilk feeds (the watery stuff that comes first and whizzes through the system) and not enough hind-milk (which comes after a good long suck and is five time fattier and more filling). This all sounded sensible enough, when I first read Gina's book (as Ruby suckled away at my breast for the 10th time in two hours). But back then, my girl was just eight weeks old, and I felt violently opposed to Gina's central premise that my special angel, who had good days and bad days, sleepy days and play days, was actually a clockwork toy who ran to the same rhythms as all the other babies on this planet. (How could she, when she was far more alert/ advanced/intelligent than any other?). So I ditched the book and towed the lovable, liberal line. If Ruby cried, down came the bra. When she slept through the afternoon, we tiptoed round the house. If she was wide awake at 1am, my husband and I did shifts. Two months later, we were all bleary-eyed basket cases. I can't recall when I decided to change tack. Perhaps it was the night Ruby woke me five times for a quick slurp. Or when I woke up myself, and practically choked trying to suppress a cough because I didn't want to disturb the sleeping princess slumped across my stomach. In any case, at some point, I wanted a baby who didn't seem hungry all the time, who wasn't either over-tired or not nearly tired enough, and who (most importantly) slept through the night in her own room. Back came the book, and slowly, gingerly, we tried easing Ruby in a more Gina-ly direction. By the time she was five months old, I had become (and remain) a routine freak, a tyrannical clockwatcher, a woman obsessed, a Gina Junky. Other mothers look puzzled when I rush home for Ruby's lunchtime nap, and can't understand why I don't take her to dinner parties. (In the days when supermodels take their babies to premi\u00e8res, it's not very 21st century to leave yours at home with the sitter.) But the rewards are obvious. Ruby is happy and bright, she naps twice a day, sleeps through the night and wakes in the morning singing. She is capable of making my least broody friends re-evaluate. 'Why is Ruby so sweet? Do you think it's nature or nurture?' one asked recently. Actually, I think it's because rather than letting a tiny baby dictate an ever-changing pattern, I set one for her. In other words, it's down to a seven-letter word beginning with 'r' - or a four letter word beginning with 'g'. But of course, I didn't tell my friend that. 'Nature or nurture? A bit of both,' I replied, looking smug.",

The deal you've been slaving over might not come off. The promotion you've been counting on may never come your way. Your children are acting up at school and show signs of delinquency. The exchange rate may rocket against you before you have time to buy your second home in France. And, yes, you may die before fulfilling your life's dream.</p> <p>Anxiety has overtaken you. Your breathing is shallow. You can't or won't focus on the very job at hand that could pull you out of this chicane, which is compounding your anxiety.</p> <p>So you have a drink, smoke a cigarette, spend money you haven't got on frivolous whims or regress to vegetable state, further compounding the anxiety. And it has to stop.</p> <p>Anxiety is endemic. We have grown accustomed to going through our daily paces in a state of low-grade anxiety, as if it is the natural state.</p> <p>Originally, anxiety is a chosen or learned response, a bogus coping mechanism usually adopted in infancy from an anxious parent. The anxiety response soon embeds itself in your psyche as a pattern, whereupon it assumes the status of an a priori truth: of course I get anxious - I've got deadlines to meet, bills to pay, etc. Sounds plausible, quite grown up, in fact.</p> <p>But as any martial artist, flying trapeze artist or commercial airline pilot will tell you, your mind and body perform to optimum levels only when you're relaxed.</p> <p>Anxiety causes the area surrounding your kidneys and adrenal glands to contract, thus impairing their functions. This leads to symptoms including lower-back ache, cystitis, headaches, tinnitus, nervous stomach, poor digestion, significant drop in sexual interest or performance, and more anxiety.</p> <p>Now you could run to your GP and attempt to stuff the feeling down with various chemicals, or you could take the self-help option: slow the tempo of your breathing down to half-time. This means relaxing your belly so your diaphragm can pull the lungs down efficiently.</p> <p>Breathe in fully. Breathe out fully. If so inclined, tell yourself you're exhaling the anxiety and inhaling calm and clarity.</p> <p>Using your fists, massage in circular motion the soft area of your lower and middle back until you feel it soften.</p> <p>Drink small amounts of valerian tea.</p> <p>Take Bach Flower Remedy of Mimulus.</p> <p>Eschew coffee and other adrenalin stimulators.</p> <p>Long-term, take up chi gong or t'ai chi, as these work intensively on strengthening the kidneys and adrenals.</p> <p>If you are suffering from extreme anxiety, visit an acupuncturist one week, a homeopath the next and a shiatsu specialist the next, repeated in rotation over a six-week period. It'll be worth the investment.</p> <p>Finally, remain mindful of your body, at work, rest and play. Whenever you find yourself in a state of unnecessary muscular gripping, get a grip with your mind instead and ask, 'Don't I deserve to feel better than this?'</p> <p><b>Your letters</b></p> <p>Hello Doctor, over the past week, I've developed an ache in my upper back on the left side. It feels muscular but I get a sharp pain when I breathe in. Might this be serious? I've just finished a long relationship. Could it be just stress-related?<br><b> Jan, Harpenden</b></p> <p>Jan, the stress of loss and grief always affects the lungs, making you more susceptible to respiratory problems at times like this. In this instance, it sounds like a lung infection of some kind, possibly pneumonia, and should be first examined by a GP in case you need antibiotics. If so, an alternative treatment is to try propolis tincture, golden seal and echinacea, which will act as a natural antibiotic, and drink mullein tea to open up the air passages. Additionally, visit a shiatsu specialist to have a go at manually moving the blockage.</p> <p>Dear Barefoot, I've suffered with lower-back pain for 18 years. I've been to osteopaths, physiotherapists and acupuncturists but they only make it worse. When I tried remedial yoga, the teacher said I was too flexible and it would damage me. What can you suggest? <br><b> Mrs F Loppy</b></p> <p>Mrs F Loppy?! You're suffering from hypermobility of the joints. Take up Pilates to strengthen the core muscles. After a few months, visit a cranio-sacral therapist to align your spine and maybe an acupuncturist to tighten the surface muscles. Avoid physiotherapy and osteopathy - the last thing you need is to move the too-mobile joints around. On an emotional level, this indicates weakness of will- spinelessness, in other words. Consider meditation as a tool for strengthening your will, and possibly a name change by deed poll to Mrs I Ronwill.</p> <p>Dear Doc, I've visited an allergy specialist and changed my diet many times, but my allergies just get worse. What can I do? <br><b> Jon Icanteatthat, Fortis Green</b></p> <p>Dear Jon, allergies arise because the deepest part of your mind is forgetting to tell your body to resist invasion by negative exogenous factors. Apply your mind and energy to building up your inner resistance - your immune system - with vigorous exercise (running, weight-training, etc) to both build stamina and mental power and, by homeopathy and or acupuncture, to trigger the immune system. Tell yourself that you welcome all input from the outside world as your friend - your mind can be powerful in combating allergens.</p> <p>\u0095 If you have any problems you'd like answers to, please write to Barefoot Doctor c/o Life Magazine, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER</p>",

The exchange rate may rocket against you before you have time to buy your second home in France. And, yes, you may die before fulfilling your life's dream. Anxiety has overtaken you. Your breathing is shallow. You can't or won't focus on the very job at hand that could pull you out of this chicane, which is compounding your anxiety. So you have a drink, smoke a cigarette, spend money you haven't got on frivolous whims or regress to vegetable state, further compounding the anxiety. And it has to stop. Anxiety is endemic. We have grown accustomed to going through our daily paces in a state of low-grade anxiety, as if it is the natural state. Originally, anxiety is a chosen or learned response, a bogus coping mechanism usually adopted in infancy from an anxious parent. The anxiety response soon embeds itself in your psyche as a pattern, whereupon it assumes the status of an a priori truth: of course I get anxious - I've got deadlines to meet, bills to pay, etc. Sounds plausible, quite grown up, in fact. But as any martial artist, flying trapeze artist or commercial airline pilot will tell you, your mind and body perform to optimum levels only when you're relaxed. Anxiety causes the area surrounding your kidneys and adrenal glands to contract, thus impairing their functions. This leads to symptoms including lower-back ache, cystitis, headaches, tinnitus, nervous stomach, poor digestion, significant drop in sexual interest or performance, and more anxiety. Now you could run to your GP and attempt to stuff the feeling down with various chemicals, or you could take the self-help option: slow the tempo of your breathing down to half-time. This means relaxing your belly so your diaphragm can pull the lungs down efficiently. Breathe in fully. Breathe out fully. If so inclined, tell yourself you're exhaling the anxiety and inhaling calm and clarity. Using your fists, massage in circular motion the soft area of your lower and middle back until you feel it soften. Drink small amounts of valerian tea. Take Bach Flower Remedy of Mimulus. Eschew coffee and other adrenalin stimulators. Long-term, take up chi gong or t'ai chi, as these work intensively on strengthening the kidneys and adrenals. If you are suffering from extreme anxiety, visit an acupuncturist one week, a homeopath the next and a shiatsu specialist the next, repeated in rotation over a six-week period. It'll be worth the investment. Finally, remain mindful of your body, at work, rest and play. Whenever you find yourself in a state of unnecessary muscular gripping, get a grip with your mind instead and ask, 'Don't I deserve to feel better than this?' Your letters Hello Doctor, over the past week, I've developed an ache in my upper back on the left side. It feels muscular but I get a sharp pain when I breathe in. Might this be serious? I've just finished a long relationship. Could it be just stress-related? Jan, Harpenden Jan, the stress of loss and grief always affects the lungs, making you more susceptible to respiratory problems at times like this. In this instance, it sounds like a lung infection of some kind, possibly pneumonia, and should be first examined by a GP in case you need antibiotics. If so, an alternative treatment is to try propolis tincture, golden seal and echinacea, which will act as a natural antibiotic, and drink mullein tea to open up the air passages. Additionally, visit a shiatsu specialist to have a go at manually moving the blockage. Dear Barefoot, I've suffered with lower-back pain for 18 years. I've been to osteopaths, physiotherapists and acupuncturists but they only make it worse. When I tried remedial yoga, the teacher said I was too flexible and it would damage me. What can you suggest? Mrs F Loppy Mrs F Loppy?! You're suffering from hypermobility of the joints. Take up Pilates to strengthen the core muscles. After a few months, visit a cranio-sacral therapist to align your spine and maybe an acupuncturist to tighten the surface muscles. Avoid physiotherapy and osteopathy - the last thing you need is to move the too-mobile joints around. On an emotional level, this indicates weakness of will- spinelessness, in other words. Consider meditation as a tool for strengthening your will, and possibly a name change by deed poll to Mrs I Ronwill. Dear Doc, I've visited an allergy specialist and changed my diet many times, but my allergies just get worse. What can I do? Jon Icanteatthat, Fortis Green Dear Jon, allergies arise because the deepest part of your mind is forgetting to tell your body to resist invasion by negative exogenous factors. Apply your mind and energy to building up your inner resistance - your immune system - with vigorous exercise (running, weight-training, etc) to both build stamina and mental power and, by homeopathy and or acupuncture, to trigger the immune system. Tell yourself that you welcome all input from the outside world as your friend - your mind can be powerful in combating allergens. \u0095 If you have any problems you'd like answers to, please write to Barefoot Doctor c/o Life Magazine, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER",

Enter, stage right, the prime suspect - work. Wicked, wicked work. An avalanche of surveys, polls and expert commentaries show that we all work too long, too hard, that our bosses are beastly, that we are insecure and afraid. You know all this stuff. We seem to be workers on the verge of a nervous breakdown.</p> <p>A council housing officer wins \u00a367,000 from her employers for workplace stress; a young, gifted surgeon works 220 hours in 10 days, then breaks into a stranger's bungalow, strips naked and bites anyone who tries to help him; a financial services company enrols its overworked staff on to a dating agency's books; Businesswoman of the Year Nikki Beckett says she keeps her weekends clear for her children - but puts in 70 hours a week for her company NSB Retail Systems; Longbridge lives, but Dagenham dies.</p> <p>So far, so bad. But there's plenty of good news about work, too - even if it is not always shared with the same enthusiasm as the 'Work Sucks' stories. The average wage has increased 57 per cent in the past decade. The proportion of firms offering maternity leave in excess of the statutory minimum has quintupled over the same time period. A third of firms now offer sabbaticals; two-thirds allow staff to work from home some of the time. Four out of 10 UK workers declare themselves 'very satisfied' with their jobs [see box page 23], more than in France, Germany, Italy or Spain.</p> <p>An infant-school dinner lady wins the Lottery but - like many of her fellow winners - keeps working. 'I love my job because I enjoy talking to the children and parents,' she said. 'It is a very responsible job.' A young woman is crowned Miss Northern Ireland and refuses to give up her admin job in a doctor's surgery. 'I love my job,' she explained. Unemployment plumbs record lows - and may even drop below the symbolic 1 million mark before long. We seem to have never had it so good.</p> <p>Consider the space devoted by magazines and newspapers to workplace issues; the sprouting advertising billboards for recruitment agencies; the exploding number of books and websites on work and work-related issues. Browse the dozens of websites containing jokes about work; peruse the humour shelves of your local bookshop - almost certainly filled with Dilbert-style laughs about our labour. Listen for just a moment to the rhetoric of the Labour government, living up to its name, pouring money into the New Deal programme to get people into work.</p> <p>Work has become our national obsession. Whether we are damning the impact of work on our health, our families, our time, or celebrating its new-found flexibility, rewards and opportunities, we are talking, writing and thinking about work like never before.</p> <p>'There is no question that work is moving up the agenda,' says Michael Willmott, co-director of the Future Foundation, a think-tank on social trends. 'Private conversations and public debate are dominated by work, and what work means.'</p> <p>As with so many obsessive relationships, the one with work is a love-hate one. Confusion reigns. Mixed messages are everywhere - on the one hand, the government bangs on and on about the importance of paid work, and then cautions about the impact of too much paid work on families. Women celebrate the economic independence work brings, then are made to feel guilty about their children. Salaries go up, but few of us feel richer. We get to a point where we feel OK about our work; and then along comes Martha Lane Fox and we think we've missed the dotcom boat. We find a job we love and so work long hours at it, and then feel that we are failing to get our 'work/life' balance right.</p> <p>Why is work under the microscope? Why all the angst? Perhaps because our work simply occupies a more important place in our lives than it did. Maybe we care, and worry, more about work for the same reason we care and worry so much about our children or our health - because it is important to us. Men and (for the first time in centuries) women are placing work closer to the centre of their lives. And maybe that's no bad thing. The 'leisure society' - remember that? - would probably have been a boring place in any case.</p> <p>Our work fixation springs from a series of profound changes in the nature of employment, all of which push work more deeply into our individual lives, our families and our communities. Work has become a more important element of our personal identity; we have greater control and choice over the shape of our working lives; women have entered and transformed the workplace; the nine-to-five has become more sociable; more of us want or need the financial independence that a wage offers; and the economic rewards of working have increased - work pays.</p> <p>Work has become a more important personal identity tag, supplanting the three traditional indicators of our uniqueness - place, faith and blood. As geographical roots have weakened, religious affiliations have diminished and the extended family has dispersed, how we spend our labouring hours has become a more important window into our souls.</p> <p>'I am sure that work is becoming more important,' says Willmott. 'People are getting at least as much sense of who they are from their work as from their family and friends.' Work is getting personal. That is why our first question at parties is not 'where do you live?' or 'do you have children?' or 'what do you believe in?' but 'what do you do?' Our work is a shorthand for ourselves.</p> <p>This trend reflects and reinforces a desire for work which brings personal fulfilment, for work we are proud of. If work means not just income but identity, then the choice of job becomes critical. This is why tobacco companies find it so hard to hire people - to work for them would be to taint your own identity.</p> <p>Ed Mayo, director of the New Economics Foundation, a lobbying group for a progressive workplace and environment, believes there is a growing thirst for work which is meaningful to the worker. 'Our surveys on quality of life show,' he says, 'that the number-one concern now is people's desire for fulfilling work.' In William Gibson's Neuromancer , Razorgirl says: 'If you love what you do, that's what you are, right?'</p> <p>Michael Willmott says that younger people are becoming more discerning about what they do - and that employment choices are being made in the context of a greater desire for freedom, fulfilment and individuality. The number of twenty- and thirtysomethings saying they 'feel a strong need for new experiences' has doubled in the same period. We want our work to demonstrate our individuality, not box us into a stereotype.</p> <p>Many column inches have been dedicated to the 'death of the career' as if that were necessarily a backwards development. It is worth remembering that the word 'career' is derived from the word for a single straight pathway; now we are starting to meander off, following our own course, seeking out new routes. John Knell, of the Industrial Society, will argue in a report published this week that a new breed of 'hyper-opportunist' worker has been born, and that work will never be the same again.</p> <p>The ability - or requirement - to create our own working life, rather than having it laid out for us by a corporate parent-replacement is another reason for our renewed interest in work. We have to think about it because no one is doing the thinking for us. There are fewer predictable corporate ladders to climb. We have to make our own.</p> <p>The fact that in a lightly regulated labour market there is no promise that a job today is a job tomorrow has altered the definition of security at work. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development estimates that one in 10 jobs cease to exist each decade.</p> <p>Andy Westwood, head of research and development at the Employment Policy Institute, says that while security was once based on one employer, or at least one set of skills, security now comes from an ability to move with the times. The transition is not an easy one. 'I think some of the difficulties of the past few years have been the birth pangs of a different kind of working life, with different kinds of security,' he says.</p> <p>The young are in the vanguard of the DIY career-makers. Younger workers are often seen as problematic for employers: disloyal, undecided, easily bored and individualistic. In the US, the average 32-year-old has had nine jobs. In the UK, one in four youngsters want to work for themselves. But Generation X is simply reacting to the new world. They have seen for themselves that no one can guarantee a job for life. They have learned that a clever and skilful employee can call the shots. It is exhausting - but it can be liberating, too.</p> <p>While the young have reinvented their expectations of work, another even more significant change has taken place: the Entry of Woman. Women will shortly outnumber men in the UK labour force, and have been flooding into work for the past few decades. This seismic social and economic shift has prompted cries of 'What about the children' and 'What about the jobs for men', and the sexist inventions of 'Superwoman' and 'The woman who has it all'.</p> <p>The real impact of women's sometimes forced entry into the workplace has been to increase the importance of work in all our lives. When work was ghettoised by gender it was up to men to worry about breadwinning and up to women to worry about bread. The female half of the population was, by and large, excluded from conversations about work - that was 'men's talk'. Now women - with an unemployment rate half that for men - talk and care about work as much as men.</p> <p>It is not just the fact of women working that has pushed work up the agenda but the nature of their work. In 1911, 39 per cent of Britain's working women were domestic servants, now they are knocking at the boardroom door. There are more women than men studying to be doctors and lawyers. Cosmopolitan magazine reports that women undergoing plastic surgery frequently say it is to help them at work, not help them snag a man.</p> <p>Conservative notions that women are being forced into work against their will, in breach of natural laws dictating that they should be rearing and caring, not earning and commanding, are bunkum. In a recent survey by Mintel, a higher proportion of women full-time workers than men said they enjoyed their job.</p> <p>The long-overdue partial feminisation of the workplace has put work at the heart of modern relationships. Dates between young men and women have to be fitted around their work schedules; if they do get together, their candlelit dinners are likely to feature a two-way discussion about work projects; if one of them is offered a job in another city, the other has to see if it is somewhere they might be able to work.</p> <p>In the past, when men worked and women cared and cleaned, mixed socialising and mating had to take place in non-work settings. Now the office has lost its gender. Of course, this means that issues such as sexual harassment and discrimination become more important - but it also makes work a place of greater opportunity.</p> <p>Indeed, more and more of us meet our lovers and life partners through work. In her book Sex and Business , Shere Hite estimates that 62 per cent of women and 71 per cent of men have had a love affair with a colleague.</p> <p>The increase in the numbers of women at work has also changed the atmosphere of the workplace and helped to create a more natural and sociable environment than the testosterone-filled offices and factories of the past. The arrival of women has coincided with an increase in the lev els of personal interaction at work; a recent survey suggests we spend more time talking to each other at work than ever before. This reflects not only the influence of women, but also a profound change in the nature of work, away from manufacturing and towards services - increasingly services that need a human touch. Hi-tech jobs are being replaced by 'high touch' jobs. Within 10 years, half of us will be in a managerial, administrative, professional or technical job.</p> <p>And while the working day is not filled with enjoyable interaction for everyone, there is no questioning the fact that for most people, most of the time, work is better now - which inevitably makes it more valuable.</p> <p>'One of the reasons work is becoming more important is that more jobs are allowing room for personal interaction,' says Willmott. 'There are fewer people in mind-numbing jobs. There's concern about people in call centres - but at least they are talking to people, at least there is some engagement.'</p> <p>Of course, the notion of work as a place for friends, lovers, chatter and socialising is not completely new. Sinclair Lewis - one of the century's most perceptive writers on working life and author of Babbitt , a kind of 1920s Dilbert - once noted the similarities between the office and the village. 'Not surprisingly,' says Jeremy Lewis, editor of The Vintage Book of Office Life , 'given the amount of time we spend in these curious places, the friendships and gossip and the intrigues and even passions of office life may well loom larger than those of domestic life.' Now that few of us live in a real village, or indeed a community that we can honestly call our own, the social role of work has increased.</p> <p>Of course, no matter how convivial our vocation, the prime reason for work is - as it has always been - to pay the bills. Today, though, a bigger slice of the population - particularly women - want or need the financial independence that comes from earning their own way. Forecaster Professor Richard Scase says: 'A growing percentage of women now have the earning capacity to live independent lifestyles.' More of us are choosing to live alone - by 2010, singletons will be the most common household type. This independence requires income, and as work is the only way to generate income, work becomes even more important, more precious.</p> <p>Fortunately, work is repaying our efforts. While there are pockets of low pay - and while women continue to lag behind men in pay - our pay packets are getting consistently fatter. At the same time, tax rates have declined so that we keep more of what we earn. Highly skilled workers in particular have seen their wages rise rapidly in the last two decades. Small wonder that they are the ones putting in the hours and obsessing most about work.</p> <p>But even for those at the bottom end of the pay scale, the rewards of working are improving. The Labour government has poured billions of pounds into tax credits to top up lower pay and put in place a minimum wage - which many employers are bettering. 'There are good reasons to be optimistic about work, and not just at the top,' says Westwood. 'Wages towards the bottom of the labour market are moving upwards quite strongly.' Work is becoming more important to us, in part at least, because it is becoming more profitable for us.</p> <p>But the new salience of work has come with a price; fewer people are able to feel secure; the need to keep pace with change is tiring and stressful; white-collar workers are putting in longer hours to try and keep a toehold - with potentially damaging consequences for the children; and the reification of work threatens to push those who are outside the paid workforce further towards the margins of society.</p> <p>The previous twins of security - corporate career paths and powerful trade unions - have each declined. While for some highly skilled workers the job-hopping mobility of the new labour market is exhilarating, for others simply staying in the race is unnerving; a quarter of us say we are 'highly stressed' at work. The stakes have got higher.</p> <p>Willmott says that while the new world offers more freedom, there are downsides. 'People who grew up with downsizing are certainly wanting and getting more control over their own destiny,' he says. 'But it means you can never let up, you have to be constantly competing, improving, reskilling. There's no fallow period.'</p> <p>Trade unions have been unable, with few exceptions, to counteract the effects of the more competitive workplace, and their memberships have declined. Fewer than one in three of us are in a union and less than one in five twentysomething workers have bothered to sign up.</p> <p>Relying on your own skills and effort for security increases the incentive to work longer hours. British men - a third of whom clock in more than 50 hours a week - work the longest hours in Europe. A US-style workaholic culture threatens us, with a 'presenteeism' attitude in the office.</p> <p>The story of working hours is actually a little more subtle than the hysterical headlines suggest. Working hours in the UK are actually declining slightly, because of the growing number of people working part-time. We work the longest hours in Europe, but we work the shortest, too. Working hours also divide along class lines - with higher-paid, more senior workers putting in much more time than junior staff.</p> <p>Of those who do work long hours, a significant proportion do so simply because they want to. Some do not see it as work; Confucius said that if you find a job you love, you'll never work another day in your life. But even if long hours are a labour of love, rather than an indication of insecurity, there are still legitimate fears for the family. If parents both work long hours, what about the children? But two-thirds of full-time working women say there is no negative impact on their family or social life outside work.</p> <p>The current vogue is to strive for greater work/life balance. But there are signs that balance may not be all it is cracked up to be. At a recent conference in San Francisco, sociologist April Gilbert presented the findings of some in-depth research with working couples - and exploded a few myths in the process. First, she found that only a minority of those interviewed were genuinely seeking 'balance' in their lives. Even more dramatically, she discovered that women who had achieved an 'enviable' balance between work and home reported low levels of job satisfaction.</p> <p>'The complaints centred around one theme,' she says. 'Balancing one's life by limiting one's work involvement results in work being less interesting, exciting and involving.' This is not to say that having parents, both of whom work all the hours God sends, is the ideal family arrangement - simply that the view of home as a delightful idyll and of work as wearying toil is too simplistic.</p> <p>A world in which work is king (or queen) is, however, a harsh one for those who are outside the labour force because of unemployment, disability, caring responsibilities - or simply because their age has disqualified them. One of the darkest sides of the new workworld is the tossing of older workers on to the scrapheap. A third of men between 50 and 65 are deemed 'economically inactive', and only 37 per cent of 64-year-olds are working, compared to 57 per cent 20 years ago.</p> <p>This would not matter so much if work did not matter so much. Not just in terms of income, but in terms of identity. When work becomes more than simply a passport to a pay cheque, when it opens the door to friends, purpose, satisfaction and a place in the world, its absence is more keenly felt. Once we admit the centrality of work to our lives, it might be harder to kid ourselves that we are doing older employees a favour by 'letting them go'.</p> <p>But we are screwed up about work. We dare not admit its importance to us. We like to moan about it, preferably with work colleagues just after work. One publisher says: 'I love my job, but I feel embarrassed even saying that. My parents think it is sad that the only friends I've got are through work - but I don't see the problem. Funnily enough, we've got lots in common!' The love of your job is now the only one that dare not speak its name. But even the French, in the privacy of an anonymous poll, say that they valued work more highly than love or sex.</p> <p>Blame religion for turning work into a penance, or blame economists who insist we only work to buy 'leisure' time, or blame trade unionists whose only mission in life is to win less work for their members, or blame competitiveness, or as a last resort blame the global economy. Or blame yourself for liking your job more than you like to admit. The idea of work as intrinsically bad has poisoned us for too long. The poet and mystic Kahlil Gibran said that work was 'love made visible'. Wouldn't it be great if we could capture a bit of that spirit, even if just for a while?</p> <p>\u0095 Richard Reeves is director of the Futures division at the Industrial Society which launches on Tuesday.

Ed Mayo, director of the New Economics Foundation, a lobbying group for a progressive workplace and environment, believes there is a growing thirst for work which is meaningful to the worker. 'Our surveys on quality of life show,' he says, 'that the number-one concern now is people's desire for fulfilling work.' In William Gibson's Neuromancer , Razorgirl says: 'If you love what you do, that's what you are, right?' Michael Willmott says that younger people are becoming more discerning about what they do - and that employment choices are being made in the context of a greater desire for freedom, fulfilment and individuality. The number of twenty- and thirtysomethings saying they 'feel a strong need for new experiences' has doubled in the same period. We want our work to demonstrate our individuality, not box us into a stereotype. Many column inches have been dedicated to the 'death of the career' as if that were necessarily a backwards development. It is worth remembering that the word 'career' is derived from the word for a single straight pathway; now we are starting to meander off, following our own course, seeking out new routes. John Knell, of the Industrial Society, will argue in a report published this week that a new breed of 'hyper-opportunist' worker has been born, and that work will never be the same again. The ability - or requirement - to create our own working life, rather than having it laid out for us by a corporate parent-replacement is another reason for our renewed interest in work. We have to think about it because no one is doing the thinking for us. There are fewer predictable corporate ladders to climb. We have to make our own. The fact that in a lightly regulated labour market there is no promise that a job today is a job tomorrow has altered the definition of security at work. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development estimates that one in 10 jobs cease to exist each decade. Andy Westwood, head of research and development at the Employment Policy Institute, says that while security was once based on one employer, or at least one set of skills, security now comes from an ability to move with the times. The transition is not an easy one. 'I think some of the difficulties of the past few years have been the birth pangs of a different kind of working life, with different kinds of security,' he says. The young are in the vanguard of the DIY career-makers. Younger workers are often seen as problematic for employers: disloyal, undecided, easily bored and individualistic. In the US, the average 32-year-old has had nine jobs. In the UK, one in four youngsters want to work for themselves. But Generation X is simply reacting to the new world. They have seen for themselves that no one can guarantee a job for life. They have learned that a clever and skilful employee can call the shots. It is exhausting - but it can be liberating, too. While the young have reinvented their expectations of work, another even more significant change has taken place: the Entry of Woman. Women will shortly outnumber men in the UK labour force, and have been flooding into work for the past few decades. This seismic social and economic shift has prompted cries of 'What about the children' and 'What about the jobs for men', and the sexist inventions of 'Superwoman' and 'The woman who has it all'. The real impact of women's sometimes forced entry into the workplace has been to increase the importance of work in all our lives. When work was ghettoised by gender it was up to men to worry about breadwinning and up to women to worry about bread. The female half of the population was, by and large, excluded from conversations about work - that was 'men's talk'. Now women - with an unemployment rate half that for men - talk and care about work as much as men. It is not just the fact of women working that has pushed work up the agenda but the nature of their work. In 1911, 39 per cent of Britain's working women were domestic servants, now they are knocking at the boardroom door. There are more women than men studying to be doctors and lawyers. Cosmopolitan magazine reports that women undergoing plastic surgery frequently say it is to help them at work, not help them snag a man. Conservative notions that women are being forced into work against their will, in breach of natural laws dictating that they should be rearing and caring, not earning and commanding, are bunkum. In a recent survey by Mintel, a higher proportion of women full-time workers than men said they enjoyed their job. The long-overdue partial feminisation of the workplace has put work at the heart of modern relationships. Dates between young men and women have to be fitted around their work schedules; if they do get together, their candlelit dinners are likely to feature a two-way discussion about work projects; if one of them is offered a job in another city, the other has to see if it is somewhere they might be able to work. In the past, when men worked and women cared and cleaned, mixed socialising and mating had to take place in non-work settings. Now the office has lost its gender. Of course, this means that issues such as sexual harassment and discrimination become more important - but it also makes work a place of greater opportunity. Indeed, more and more of us meet our lovers and life partners through work. In her book Sex and Business , Shere Hite estimates that 62 per cent of women and 71 per cent of men have had a love affair with a colleague. The increase in the numbers of women at work has also changed the atmosphere of the workplace and helped to create a more natural and sociable environment than the testosterone-filled offices and factories of the past. The arrival of women has coincided with an increase in the lev els of personal interaction at work; a recent survey suggests we spend more time talking to each other at work than ever before. This reflects not only the influence of women, but also a profound change in the nature of work, away from manufacturing and towards services - increasingly services that need a human touch. Hi-tech jobs are being replaced by 'high touch' jobs. Within 10 years, half of us will be in a managerial, administrative, professional or technical job. And while the working day is not filled with enjoyable interaction for everyone, there is no questioning the fact that for most people, most of the time, work is better now - which inevitably makes it more valuable. 'One of the reasons work is becoming more important is that more jobs are allowing room for personal interaction,' says Willmott. 'There are fewer people in mind-numbing jobs. There's concern about people in call centres - but at least they are talking to people, at least there is some engagement.' Of course, the notion of work as a place for friends, lovers, chatter and socialising is not completely new. Sinclair Lewis - one of the century's most perceptive writers on working life and author of Babbitt , a kind of 1920s Dilbert - once noted the similarities between the office and the village. 'Not surprisingly,' says Jeremy Lewis, editor of The Vintage Book of Office Life , 'given the amount of time we spend in these curious places, the friendships and gossip and the intrigues and even passions of office life may well loom larger than those of domestic life.' Now that few of us live in a real village, or indeed a community that we can honestly call our own, the social role of work has increased. Of course, no matter how convivial our vocation, the prime reason for work is - as it has always been - to pay the bills. Today, though, a bigger slice of the population - particularly women - want or need the financial independence that comes from earning their own way. Forecaster Professor Richard Scase says: 'A growing percentage of women now have the earning capacity to live independent lifestyles.' More of us are choosing to live alone - by 2010, singletons will be the most common household type. This independence requires income, and as work is the only way to generate income, work becomes even more important, more precious. Fortunately, work is repaying our efforts. While there are pockets of low pay - and while women continue to lag behind men in pay - our pay packets are getting consistently fatter. At the same time, tax rates have declined so that we keep more of what we earn. Highly skilled workers in particular have seen their wages rise rapidly in the last two decades. Small wonder that they are the ones putting in the hours and obsessing most about work. But even for those at the bottom end of the pay scale, the rewards of working are improving. The Labour government has poured billions of pounds into tax credits to top up lower pay and put in place a minimum wage - which many employers are bettering. 'There are good reasons to be optimistic about work, and not just at the top,' says Westwood. 'Wages towards the bottom of the labour market are moving upwards quite strongly.' Work is becoming more important to us, in part at least, because it is becoming more profitable for us. But the new salience of work has come with a price; fewer people are able to feel secure; the need to keep pace with change is tiring and stressful; white-collar workers are putting in longer hours to try and keep a toehold - with potentially damaging consequences for the children; and the reification of work threatens to push those who are outside the paid workforce further towards the margins of society. The previous twins of security - corporate career paths and powerful trade unions - have each declined. While for some highly skilled workers the job-hopping mobility of the new labour market is exhilarating, for others simply staying in the race is unnerving; a quarter of us say we are 'highly stressed' at work. The stakes have got higher. Willmott says that while the new world offers more freedom, there are downsides. 'People who grew up with downsizing are certainly wanting and getting more control over their own destiny,' he says. 'But it means you can never let up, you have to be constantly competing, improving, reskilling. There's no fallow period.' Trade unions have been unable, with few exceptions, to counteract the effects of the more competitive workplace, and their memberships have declined. Fewer than one in three of us are in a union and less than one in five twentysomething workers have bothered to sign up. Relying on your own skills and effort for security increases the incentive to work longer hours. British men - a third of whom clock in more than 50 hours a week - work the longest hours in Europe. A US-style workaholic culture threatens us, with a 'presenteeism' attitude in the office. The story of working hours is actually a little more subtle than the hysterical headlines suggest. Working hours in the UK are actually declining slightly, because of the growing number of people working part-time. We work the longest hours in Europe, but we work the shortest, too. Working hours also divide along class lines - with higher-paid, more senior workers putting in much more time than junior staff. Of those who do work long hours, a significant proportion do so simply because they want to. Some do not see it as work; Confucius said that if you find a job you love, you'll never work another day in your life. But even if long hours are a labour of love, rather than an indication of insecurity, there are still legitimate fears for the family. If parents both work long hours, what about the children? But two-thirds of full-time working women say there is no negative impact on their family or social life outside work. The current vogue is to strive for greater work/life balance. But there are signs that balance may not be all it is cracked up to be. At a recent conference in San Francisco, sociologist April Gilbert presented the findings of some in-depth research with working couples - and exploded a few myths in the process. First, she found that only a minority of those interviewed were genuinely seeking 'balance' in their lives. Even more dramatically, she discovered that women who had achieved an 'enviable' balance between work and home reported low levels of job satisfaction. 'The complaints centred around one theme,' she says. 'Balancing one's life by limiting one's work involvement results in work being less interesting, exciting and involving.' This is not to say that having parents, both of whom work all the hours God sends, is the ideal family arrangement - simply that the view of home as a delightful idyll and of work as wearying toil is too simplistic. A world in which work is king (or queen) is, however, a harsh one for those who are outside the labour force because of unemployment, disability, caring responsibilities - or simply because their age has disqualified them. One of the darkest sides of the new workworld is the tossing of older workers on to the scrapheap. A third of men between 50 and 65 are deemed 'economically inactive', and only 37 per cent of 64-year-olds are working, compared to 57 per cent 20 years ago. This would not matter so much if work did not matter so much. Not just in terms of income, but in terms of identity. When work becomes more than simply a passport to a pay cheque, when it opens the door to friends, purpose, satisfaction and a place in the world, its absence is more keenly felt. Once we admit the centrality of work to our lives, it might be harder to kid ourselves that we are doing older employees a favour by 'letting them go'. But we are screwed up about work. We dare not admit its importance to us. We like to moan about it, preferably with work colleagues just after work. One publisher says: 'I love my job, but I feel embarrassed even saying that. My parents think it is sad that the only friends I've got are through work - but I don't see the problem. Funnily enough, we've got lots in common!' The love of your job is now the only one that dare not speak its name. But even the French, in the privacy of an anonymous poll, say that they valued work more highly than love or sex. Blame religion for turning work into a penance, or blame economists who insist we only work to buy 'leisure' time, or blame trade unionists whose only mission in life is to win less work for their members, or blame competitiveness, or as a last resort blame the global economy. Or blame yourself for liking your job more than you like to admit. The idea of work as intrinsically bad has poisoned us for too long. The poet and mystic Kahlil Gibran said that work was 'love made visible'. Wouldn't it be great if we could capture a bit of that spirit, even if just for a while? \u0095 Richard Reeves is director of the Futures division at the Industrial Society which launches on Tuesday.

      "body": "<p>It was early last summer that Patricia Hearst began to hear the Kathleen Soliah rumours. Soliah had been a sometime member of the Symbionese Liberation Army that had kidnapped Hearst a quarter of a century before. She had gone underground shortly after Hearst's arrest and hadn't been heard of since. The rumours were that Soliah was hoping to re-surface, but wanted to cut a deal that ruled out jail time. Hearst had no strong feelings about this.</p> <p>Then in mid-June, a photo of Soliah popped up on the TV show, America's Most Wanted ; a special to mark the 25th anniversary of the shoot-out in Los Angeles in which six of the SLA had died. A few days later, Sara Jane Olson, doctor's wife and community activist, was arrested in St Paul, Minnesota. Olson, as Soliah now called herself, was charged with the failed bombings of a couple of police cars to avenge the shoot-out. She had been arrested en route to a class she was teaching at the Center for Victims of Torture.</p> <p>Hearst still felt detached. 'I just ignored it. Because what she was going to get charged with didn't concern me,' she says. We are speaking in a flat on Manhattan's Upper East Side. Hearst is more strapping than when she was a wraith on magazine covers, but she remains wholly recognisable, with big bright eyes and wavy hair the complicated colour of tarnished bronze. She speaks with the sort of American blue-blood cadences that sound like heels creaking into fresh snow, and she has an oddly old-fashioned repertoire of 'ughs!' and meaningful sighs.</p> <p>This January, Judge James Ideman of the Los Angeles Superior Court ruled that the Soliah prosecution could examine all of the crimes of the SLA - the most baleful being the gunning down of a woman during a robbery in a California bank. Kathy Soliah had been part of the hold-up posse, and Hearst had been a lookout outside. The killing had never been prosecuted. Now, Hearst was to be a reluctant star witness against Kathy Soliah.</p> <p>It happens that there have been certain resemblances in the vectors of Hearst's and Soliah's later lives. Both have adolescent daughters - Hearst two and Soliah three. Both act - Soliah in community theatre, Hearst in small movie roles, most especially in the films of John Waters - she plays a terrorist's mother in his forthcoming Cecil B DeMented . Both have survived.</p> <p>The differences have been greater, though. Soliah hid in plain sight, in the very heart of the middle-middle-class Midwest. Hearst is married to Bernard Shaw, one of her former bodyguards, and lives in Connecticut, the most patrician of the New England states. When her name appears in print - on the invitation to a benefit, say, it is always as Patricia. It is as Patricia Hearst that she appears in movie credits. Now, she is Patty Hearst again.</p> <p>On 1 July this year, Judge Ideman lifted a gag order he had imposed, ineffectually, on all parties (the trial is set for 8 January 2001). The Sarah Olson Defense Fund Committee had been raising funds by selling T-shirts and a cookbook, Serving Time: America's Most Wanted Recipes, by Sara Jane Olson, her Family and Friends . A cover picture shows Olson holding a waffle iron in one hand, handcuffs dangling from the other. At a benefit, she spoke in defence of her actions of a quarter of a century before, saying she had only been one of 'perhaps tens of thousands of people who felt the same way, acted the same way'. She added, 'I never underwent any kind of redemption. I never really changed. I just got older.'</p> <p>Hitherto Patty Hearst had borne Kathy Soliah no particular ill will. Soliah had not been one of her kidnappers. Plunge back into that time. When Hearst was kidnapped on 4 February 1974, the West was waking up from the hippy dream. The Oz magazine obscenity trial had been about as extreme as things got here - but the Hearst kidnapping was a template for what was to come in the dour shapes of the kidnap-happy Red Brigades and the Baader-Meinhof Gruppe.</p> <p>Hearst is the daughter of media magnate Randolph Hearst, the grand-daughter of WR Hearst, who was savaged in Citizen Kane . Her kidnapping at the age of 19 from the flat she shared with her fianc\u00e9 Steven Weed on the Berkeley campus made her the most famous woman in the world - a fact of which she was at first wholly unaware. Stuck in a cupboard for 57 days, she tape-recorded demands that her father come up with what would have amounted to a ransom of $25m worth of food for the poor.</p> <p>She met the eight SLA members, including Nancy Perry, Angela Attwood, Bill and Emily Harris, and their leader, the black ex-con, Donald de Freeze aka Field Marshal Cinque. Hearst submitted to sex because it was the 'comradely' thing to do. She recorded an announcement that she joined the group as 'Tania'. Soon she was absorbing Cinque's gruelling programming, which involved relentless exercise, weapons training, propaganda, self criticism, under-nourishment and unutterable fatigue, all in an interminable drizzle of weepiness. Tania was photographed holding a gun in front of the SLA symbol, a seven-headed cobra. She was photographed again, by automatic bank cameras, in the act of robbing the Hibernia Bank on 15 April 1974 - which was owned by the father of her best friend, Trish Tobin.</p> <p>Hearst and the Harrises were operating as an independent unit when Cinque and the remaining SLA members perished in a shoot-out with several hundred feds - a scene that creaks with symbolic overload when you learn that the Harrises and Hearst were watching this shoot-out on the TV in a motel in view of Disneyland. But the threesome were located and hidden by a radical sportswriter, Jack Scott.</p> <p>Kathy Soliah had joined the depleted cell after the shoot out because Angela Attwood had been her best friend. Kathy's brother Steven and her younger sister Josephine had also been recruited, though their roles were marginal.</p> <p>But Hearst and the Harrises were nabbed by the FBI on 19 September 1975. Hearst was the only person tried for the Hibernia job. She was found guilty, and sentenced to seven years. Two years later, her sentence was commuted by President Carter on the grounds that had she not been kidnapped, she'd never have been involved in any crimes. Two years after Hearst's conviction, the Harrises pleaded guilty to her kidnapping. They served eight years. Kathy Soliah, meanwhile, had got clean away. Until now.</p> <p>How determined a revolutionary had she seemed when Hearst first met her, I asked?</p> <p>'There seemed to be a number of radicals and would-be revolutionaries who managed to live out their revolutionary beliefs vicariously through groups like the SLA. I think she was one of those,' says Hearst.</p> <p>You found it easier to talk with Steve?</p> <p>'Yeah, because he and Josephine just weren't as into it. It seemed they were more or less following their older sister. She was definitely the more committed one.'</p> <p>During the last days of the SLA, the Soliahs had financed the revolution by petty theft. 'They would go to health clubs and steal people's wallets. Then they would go and write bad checks,' Hearst says. 'And shoplifting. They were all proud of that.'</p> <p>Hearst took a walk with Kathy Soliah immediately before the bank job that turned deadly. She remembers Soliah had been peppy before, leaden during the getaway. 'I just remember that it was clear that something wasn't right when they got into the car. There was a problem. But everything gets further away. Now it's just impressions of what were impressions back then.'</p> <p>Last October, Jack Scott, who had<b> </b> throat cancer, gave a 'deathbed confession' to Kathy Soliah's then attorney, Susan Jordan, and to the FBI. Scott claimed that when he offered to free Hearst, she 'told them to take her where they were supposed to, or they would all be dead'. Also, that she had her own private hit list, and that Jane Fonda was on it.</p> <p>Most remarkably, Scott claimed that Patty Hearst had organised her own kidnapping with one of the SLA members 'who was Hearst's supplier of marijuana in Berkeley'. The FBI interview quotes Scott as saying 'Perry told Cinque, leader of the SLA, about the plan and he thought kidnapping Hearst would be great publicity. The other members of the SLA were not told about it.' So - in this version - those in the know died in the shoot out and the innocent Harrises went to the slammer. Two days after his confession, Jack Scott died, his claims unexamined.</p> <p>I met Patricia Hearst in an ever-so-slightly fancy restaurant on Madison Avenue. What has it been like being plunged into all this again, I asked. 'I have basically spent my life trying to forget these people,' she says. 'My entire adult life has been post-kidnapping. I was 19 when I was kidnapped. I have no way of determining what I would be like without that. Because there was nothing before.'</p> <p>Scott's most serious claim is that you planned your own kidnapping. In your book, Every Secret Thing , you mention that rumours you organised the kidnapping yourself sprang up right away. Why? 'Everybody believed in conspiracies at that time. Something peculiar was going on! Some people were sure that de Freeze was a government agent, that this was all a plot, that everyone worked for the CIA.'</p> <p>Didn't the FBI have the SLA hit list with your name before the kidnapping? 'Oh, yeah! The FBI admitted they knew about it. What they told my mother was they had them on the run and would catch them quickly. After I was kidnapped, the FBI did inform other people. Gerald Ford's daughter, Susan, and these girls I went to school with, the Bechtels. They told me their security was massive.'</p> <p>What about the hit list that Scott said you kept personally? 'Oh, that's just ridiculous. On the drive across the country? Now the SLA did keep a file of people. And we were all expected to go through the newspapers and clip out people. Like, well, what about this person?'</p> <p>Jane Fonda? 'No. They were never interested in movie stars. Because in one of the books they had there was a thing about how you don't kidnap or murder soccer stars or movie stars or any of these popular icons because that just infuriates the people. You have to pick targets they understand, like generals and the police. Which leads you to wonder: why the hell did they kidnap me?'</p> <p>What was Jack Scott's original motive? 'He did nothing but try to get money. He wanted money when he took the SLA across country. He wanted to write a book. He had the plans all set up to open up a bank account in Liechtenstein, and a dummy corporation, and filter money to the SLA. He had gone to my parents, even, to try to get money after he'd lost contact with the group. He was so drunk he fell down the stairs.'</p> <p>Patty Hearst has been sucked back into it all - back into the time of the closet. 'Emily Harris showed me this magazine cover. It was a split cover with me on one side and Solzhenitsyn on the other. And that sticks in my mind as the most bizarre part of the whole deal. A 19-year-old kidnapped co-ed and Alexander Solzhenitsyn was a bizarre juxtaposition.'</p> <p>She gives a breathy, disbelieving laugh. 'Looking back, it's symbolic of what makes people famous today. Which is nothing! Being in the wrong place at the wrong time turns you into an international cultural icon.'</p> <p>No sooner had Patricia become Patty Hearst, of course, than she metamorphosed again, this time into 'Tania' the revolutionary. Powerful images defined her. The photograph of her posing with a gun in front of the seven-headed SLA cobra was art-directed by Cinque. 'That picture was lifted off a Jimmy Cliff reggae album. I think it was from the film The Harder They Come ,' Hearst says.</p> <p>Even more notorious are the Hibernia Bank shots. 'I'm just so grateful that there weren't video cameras available then,' she says. 'You have no idea. If those had been available at the time, widely available, we'd still be seeing the stuff. A tape recording and photographs are not quite so effective.' Effective enough, though. Kathy Soliah was undone by her mug shot on TV.</p> <p>Nervously, I produce a batch of Time and Newsweek covers, including the one in which her face is stamped with huge crude letters reading GUILTY. She looks, without flinching. 'I actually got invited to the Time magazine party,' she said. This had been the shindig celebrating the magazine's 75th birthday, at which scores of cover subjects had been present. 'I turned it down. They called four times, faxed three times. And the letter was so hilarious. At first, I thought it was a hoax. I would like to know: did Tim McVeigh get this same letter? OJ? Finally I said we were going to be out of town. And then I saw pictures of people like Mary Tyler Moore posing next to their covers. And I thought how odd would that have been.'</p> <p>Field Marshal Cinque once told Tania she could never be free of the SLA. This has turned out to be a paranoid's sound sense. There was the sheer intensity of scrutiny. 'For a while, I didn't want to go out. It was hard. I mean, the traffic stopped. You would see people turn around and be walking backwards.' Hearst says. 'So many people know about the case or think they know about the case or are confused about the case. Everything he said seemed to come true.'</p> <p>President Carter's decision to commute Hearst's sentence had come after reviewing the evidence and taking into consideration the numerous cases that the government was unable to make because they had put Hearst on trial. Hearst duly set the wheels in motion to apply for a presidential pardon. Eighteen months ago, her 'pardon package' reached the Justice Department.</p> <p>Two weeks later, a United Parcel Service van delivered a cardboard box to the Connecticut house. It wasn't correctly addressed and she didn't recognise the name of the sender, Brad O'Husky. The UPS driver struck her as strangely insistent that she take the box indoors, but her days with the SLA - whose members frequently discussed such creative ways of death-dealing as mail bombs - have left her super-sensitive.</p> <p>She refused. A few minutes later, the agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration were all over her. The box contained $40,000 worth of drugs. The UPS driver had been a DEA agent. In Connecticut, this is embarrassing - like being busted in full view of the neighbours in, say, Eaton Square.</p> <p>'When those drugs came to my house, I called both children's schools,' Hearst says. 'If somebody comes with a badge showing that they're federal agents, you do not let those children go anywhere with them. You call the local police immediately. First of all, I don't believe they're federal agents. And, second, if they are, I don't want my children anywhere near them.'</p> <p>The identity of the sender of the drugs remains a mystery.</p> <p>'The DEA likes to think that it's an embittered old radical,' Hearst says, adding, after a fretful pause: 'I just happen to think that the timing two weeks after President Carter had talked to President Clinton about me - that to me is so suspicious! You know, I can't shake that at all.' Rightly or wrongly, she suspects some federal hand, equally embittered by so many foul ups, so long ago.</p> <p>The pardon is somewhat symbolic at this juncture. 'Legally, I can vote, but I can't go to the polls because people try to stop me,' Hearst says. 'They recognise me. They just make a scene. \"She's a convicted felon! She's not allowed to vote!\" I did actually call the FBI at one point. They called me back and said, \"You're allowed to vote. It's not an issue. Call us any time there's another problem like this.\" Well, there's not going to be - because I'm not going to do it.'</p> <p>The upcoming trial of Kathy Soliah aka Sara Jane Olson has underlined the dark side of being a convicted felon. 'It's just that the government has set me up in such a way that I'm the only witness, and the strongest witness, and the one with the least credibility because of what they did.' Laugh.</p> <p>With the trial, the murder in the Crocker National Bank will finally be explored in court. Patty Hearst, a self-described 'reluctant witness', became a little less so when she learned that the committee was operating from a website called <a href=\"http://www.pattyhearst.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.pattyhearst.com</a>. 'If they just had my name and it wasn't doing anything to do with it, I wouldn't have cared less,' she says. 'Then I looked at it, and I thought, That's creepy! It had my CV... stills from movies... it had all of the tapes transcribed... apparently it had WANTED posters for sale, and T-shirts. It was basically pretty unsavoury. But it wasn't offensive. It was just something you could ignore. When it changed into the Free Kathy Soliah link. You know, press here to see how you can help - that's when I completely flipped out. I looked up the site, and she's mugging for the camera with her cookbook, and there were letters on it saying: Patty. I love your website! I find everything about if offensive. They don't care, because it's the internet, there are no laws. So I ended up buying it back from this man. He's a Santeria priest or something. Please!</p> <p>'I had to have a computer geek.

But I have had to live my entire life never out of the public eye and without public scrutiny because of her actions, and the actions of the Harrises, and the rest of the SLA members, and I just didn't feel that sorry for her.

      "bodyText": "It was early last summer that Patricia Hearst began to hear the Kathleen Soliah rumours. Soliah had been a sometime member of the Symbionese Liberation Army that had kidnapped Hearst a quarter of a century before. She had gone underground shortly after Hearst's arrest and hadn't been heard of since. The rumours were that Soliah was hoping to re-surface, but wanted to cut a deal that ruled out jail time. Hearst had no strong feelings about this. Then in mid-June, a photo of Soliah popped up on the TV show, America's Most Wanted ; a special to mark the 25th anniversary of the shoot-out in Los Angeles in which six of the SLA had died. A few days later, Sara Jane Olson, doctor's wife and community activist, was arrested in St Paul, Minnesota. Olson, as Soliah now called herself, was charged with the failed bombings of a couple of police cars to avenge the shoot-out. She had been arrested en route to a class she was teaching at the Center for Victims of Torture. Hearst still felt detached. 'I just ignored it. Because what she was going to get charged with didn't concern me,' she says. We are speaking in a flat on Manhattan's Upper East Side. Hearst is more strapping than when she was a wraith on magazine covers, but she remains wholly recognisable, with big bright eyes and wavy hair the complicated colour of tarnished bronze. She speaks with the sort of American blue-blood cadences that sound like heels creaking into fresh snow, and she has an oddly old-fashioned repertoire of 'ughs!' and meaningful sighs. This January, Judge James Ideman of the Los Angeles Superior Court ruled that the Soliah prosecution could examine all of the crimes of the SLA - the most baleful being the gunning down of a woman during a robbery in a California bank. Kathy Soliah had been part of the hold-up posse, and Hearst had been a lookout outside. The killing had never been prosecuted. Now, Hearst was to be a reluctant star witness against Kathy Soliah. It happens that there have been certain resemblances in the vectors of Hearst's and Soliah's later lives. Both have adolescent daughters - Hearst two and Soliah three. Both act - Soliah in community theatre, Hearst in small movie roles, most especially in the films of John Waters - she plays a terrorist's mother in his forthcoming Cecil B DeMented . Both have survived. The differences have been greater, though. Soliah hid in plain sight, in the very heart of the middle-middle-class Midwest. Hearst is married to Bernard Shaw, one of her former bodyguards, and lives in Connecticut, the most patrician of the New England states. When her name appears in print - on the invitation to a benefit, say, it is always as Patricia. It is as Patricia Hearst that she appears in movie credits. Now, she is Patty Hearst again. On 1 July this year, Judge Ideman lifted a gag order he had imposed, ineffectually, on all parties (the trial is set for 8 January 2001). The Sarah Olson Defense Fund Committee had been raising funds by selling T-shirts and a cookbook, Serving Time: America's Most Wanted Recipes, by Sara Jane Olson, her Family and Friends . A cover picture shows Olson holding a waffle iron in one hand, handcuffs dangling from the other. At a benefit, she spoke in defence of her actions of a quarter of a century before, saying she had only been one of 'perhaps tens of thousands of people who felt the same way, acted the same way'. She added, 'I never underwent any kind of redemption. I never really changed. I just got older.' Hitherto Patty Hearst had borne Kathy Soliah no particular ill will. Soliah had not been one of her kidnappers. Plunge back into that time. When Hearst was kidnapped on 4 February 1974, the West was waking up from the hippy dream. The Oz magazine obscenity trial had been about as extreme as things got here - but the Hearst kidnapping was a template for what was to come in the dour shapes of the kidnap-happy Red Brigades and the Baader-Meinhof Gruppe. Hearst is the daughter of media magnate Randolph Hearst, the grand-daughter of WR Hearst, who was savaged in Citizen Kane . Her kidnapping at the age of 19 from the flat she shared with her fianc\u00e9 Steven Weed on the Berkeley campus made her the most famous woman in the world - a fact of which she was at first wholly unaware. Stuck in a cupboard for 57 days, she tape-recorded demands that her father come up with what would have amounted to a ransom of $25m worth of food for the poor. She met the eight SLA members, including Nancy Perry, Angela Attwood, Bill and Emily Harris, and their leader, the black ex-con, Donald de Freeze aka Field Marshal Cinque. Hearst submitted to sex because it was the 'comradely' thing to do. She recorded an announcement that she joined the group as 'Tania'. Soon she was absorbing Cinque's gruelling programming, which involved relentless exercise, weapons training, propaganda, self criticism, under-nourishment and unutterable fatigue, all in an interminable drizzle of weepiness. Tania was photographed holding a gun in front of the SLA symbol, a seven-headed cobra. She was photographed again, by automatic bank cameras, in the act of robbing the Hibernia Bank on 15 April 1974 - which was owned by the father of her best friend, Trish Tobin. Hearst and the Harrises were operating as an independent unit when Cinque and the remaining SLA members perished in a shoot-out with several hundred feds - a scene that creaks with symbolic overload when you learn that the Harrises and Hearst were watching this shoot-out on the TV in a motel in view of Disneyland. But the threesome were located and hidden by a radical sportswriter, Jack Scott. Kathy Soliah had joined the depleted cell after the shoot out because Angela Attwood had been her best friend. Kathy's brother Steven and her younger sister Josephine had also been recruited, though their roles were marginal. But Hearst and the Harrises were nabbed by the FBI on 19 September 1975. Hearst was the only person tried for the Hibernia job. She was found guilty, and sentenced to seven years. Two years later, her sentence was commuted by President Carter on the grounds that had she not been kidnapped, she'd never have been involved in any crimes. Two years after Hearst's conviction, the Harrises pleaded guilty to her kidnapping. They served eight years. Kathy Soliah, meanwhile, had got clean away. Until now. How determined a revolutionary had she seemed when Hearst first met her, I asked? 'There seemed to be a number of radicals and would-be revolutionaries who managed to live out their revolutionary beliefs vicariously through groups like the SLA. I think she was one of those,' says Hearst. You found it easier to talk with Steve? 'Yeah, because he and Josephine just weren't as into it. It seemed they were more or less following their older sister. She was definitely the more committed one.' During the last days of the SLA, the Soliahs had financed the revolution by petty theft. 'They would go to health clubs and steal people's wallets. Then they would go and write bad checks,' Hearst says. 'And shoplifting. They were all proud of that.' Hearst took a walk with Kathy Soliah immediately before the bank job that turned deadly. She remembers Soliah had been peppy before, leaden during the getaway. 'I just remember that it was clear that something wasn't right when they got into the car. There was a problem. But everything gets further away. Now it's just impressions of what were impressions back then.' Last October, Jack Scott, who had throat cancer, gave a 'deathbed confession' to Kathy Soliah's then attorney, Susan Jordan, and to the FBI. Scott claimed that when he offered to free Hearst, she 'told them to take her where they were supposed to, or they would all be dead'. Also, that she had her own private hit list, and that Jane Fonda was on it. Most remarkably, Scott claimed that Patty Hearst had organised her own kidnapping with one of the SLA members 'who was Hearst's supplier of marijuana in Berkeley'. The FBI interview quotes Scott as saying 'Perry told Cinque, leader of the SLA, about the plan and he thought kidnapping Hearst would be great publicity. The other members of the SLA were not told about it.' So - in this version - those in the know died in the shoot out and the innocent Harrises went to the slammer. Two days after his confession, Jack Scott died, his claims unexamined. I met Patricia Hearst in an ever-so-slightly fancy restaurant on Madison Avenue. What has it been like being plunged into all this again, I asked. 'I have basically spent my life trying to forget these people,' she says. 'My entire adult life has been post-kidnapping. I was 19 when I was kidnapped. I have no way of determining what I would be like without that. Because there was nothing before.' Scott's most serious claim is that you planned your own kidnapping. In your book, Every Secret Thing , you mention that rumours you organised the kidnapping yourself sprang up right away. Why? 'Everybody believed in conspiracies at that time. Something peculiar was going on! Some people were sure that de Freeze was a government agent, that this was all a plot, that everyone worked for the CIA.' Didn't the FBI have the SLA hit list with your name before the kidnapping? 'Oh, yeah! The FBI admitted they knew about it. What they told my mother was they had them on the run and would catch them quickly. After I was kidnapped, the FBI did inform other people. Gerald Ford's daughter, Susan, and these girls I went to school with, the Bechtels. They told me their security was massive.' What about the hit list that Scott said you kept personally? 'Oh, that's just ridiculous. On the drive across the country? Now the SLA did keep a file of people. And we were all expected to go through the newspapers and clip out people. Like, well, what about this person?' Jane Fonda? 'No. They were never interested in movie stars. Because in one of the books they had there was a thing about how you don't kidnap or murder soccer stars or movie stars or any of these popular icons because that just infuriates the people. You have to pick targets they understand, like generals and the police. Which leads you to wonder: why the hell did they kidnap me?' What was Jack Scott's original motive? 'He did nothing but try to get money. He wanted money when he took the SLA across country. He wanted to write a book. He had the plans all set up to open up a bank account in Liechtenstein, and a dummy corporation, and filter money to the SLA. He had gone to my parents, even, to try to get money after he'd lost contact with the group. He was so drunk he fell down the stairs.' Patty Hearst has been sucked back into it all - back into the time of the closet. 'Emily Harris showed me this magazine cover. It was a split cover with me on one side and Solzhenitsyn on the other. And that sticks in my mind as the most bizarre part of the whole deal. A 19-year-old kidnapped co-ed and Alexander Solzhenitsyn was a bizarre juxtaposition.' She gives a breathy, disbelieving laugh. 'Looking back, it's symbolic of what makes people famous today. Which is nothing! Being in the wrong place at the wrong time turns you into an international cultural icon.' No sooner had Patricia become Patty Hearst, of course, than she metamorphosed again, this time into 'Tania' the revolutionary. Powerful images defined her. The photograph of her posing with a gun in front of the seven-headed SLA cobra was art-directed by Cinque. 'That picture was lifted off a Jimmy Cliff reggae album. I think it was from the film The Harder They Come ,' Hearst says. Even more notorious are the Hibernia Bank shots. 'I'm just so grateful that there weren't video cameras available then,' she says. 'You have no idea. If those had been available at the time, widely available, we'd still be seeing the stuff. A tape recording and photographs are not quite so effective.' Effective enough, though. Kathy Soliah was undone by her mug shot on TV. Nervously, I produce a batch of Time and Newsweek covers, including the one in which her face is stamped with huge crude letters reading GUILTY. She looks, without flinching. 'I actually got invited to the Time magazine party,' she said. This had been the shindig celebrating the magazine's 75th birthday, at which scores of cover subjects had been present. 'I turned it down. They called four times, faxed three times. And the letter was so hilarious. At first, I thought it was a hoax. I would like to know: did Tim McVeigh get this same letter? OJ? Finally I said we were going to be out of town. And then I saw pictures of people like Mary Tyler Moore posing next to their covers. And I thought how odd would that have been.' Field Marshal Cinque once told Tania she could never be free of the SLA. This has turned out to be a paranoid's sound sense. There was the sheer intensity of scrutiny. 'For a while, I didn't want to go out. It was hard. I mean, the traffic stopped. You would see people turn around and be walking backwards.' Hearst says. 'So many people know about the case or think they know about the case or are confused about the case. Everything he said seemed to come true.' President Carter's decision to commute Hearst's sentence had come after reviewing the evidence and taking into consideration the numerous cases that the government was unable to make because they had put Hearst on trial. Hearst duly set the wheels in motion to apply for a presidential pardon. Eighteen months ago, her 'pardon package' reached the Justice Department. Two weeks later, a United Parcel Service van delivered a cardboard box to the Connecticut house. It wasn't correctly addressed and she didn't recognise the name of the sender, Brad O'Husky. The UPS driver struck her as strangely insistent that she take the box indoors, but her days with the SLA - whose members frequently discussed such creative ways of death-dealing as mail bombs - have left her super-sensitive. She refused. A few minutes later, the agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration were all over her. The box contained $40,000 worth of drugs. The UPS driver had been a DEA agent. In Connecticut, this is embarrassing - like being busted in full view of the neighbours in, say, Eaton Square. 'When those drugs came to my house, I called both children's schools,' Hearst says. 'If somebody comes with a badge showing that they're federal agents, you do not let those children go anywhere with them. You call the local police immediately. First of all, I don't believe they're federal agents. And, second, if they are, I don't want my children anywhere near them.' The identity of the sender of the drugs remains a mystery. 'The DEA likes to think that it's an embittered old radical,' Hearst says, adding, after a fretful pause: 'I just happen to think that the timing two weeks after President Carter had talked to President Clinton about me - that to me is so suspicious! You know, I can't shake that at all.' Rightly or wrongly, she suspects some federal hand, equally embittered by so many foul ups, so long ago. The pardon is somewhat symbolic at this juncture. 'Legally, I can vote, but I can't go to the polls because people try to stop me,' Hearst says. 'They recognise me. They just make a scene. \"She's a convicted felon! She's not allowed to vote!\" I did actually call the FBI at one point. They called me back and said, \"You're allowed to vote. It's not an issue. Call us any time there's another problem like this.\" Well, there's not going to be - because I'm not going to do it.' The upcoming trial of Kathy Soliah aka Sara Jane Olson has underlined the dark side of being a convicted felon. 'It's just that the government has set me up in such a way that I'm the only witness, and the strongest witness, and the one with the least credibility because of what they did.' Laugh. With the trial, the murder in the Crocker National Bank will finally be explored in court. Patty Hearst, a self-described 'reluctant witness', became a little less so when she learned that the committee was operating from a website called www.pattyhearst.com. 'If they just had my name and it wasn't doing anything to do with it, I wouldn't have cared less,' she says. 'Then I looked at it, and I thought, That's creepy! It had my CV... stills from movies... it had all of the tapes transcribed... apparently it had WANTED posters for sale, and T-shirts. It was basically pretty unsavoury. But it wasn't offensive. It was just something you could ignore. When it changed into the Free Kathy Soliah link. You know, press here to see how you can help - that's when I completely flipped out. I looked up the site, and she's mugging for the camera with her cookbook, and there were letters on it saying: Patty. I love your website! I find everything about if offensive. They don't care, because it's the internet, there are no laws. So I ended up buying it back from this man. He's a Santeria priest or something. Please! 'I had to have a computer geek. It's the kind of thing where lawyers are useless. You need a geek to deal with this, because they get it done. So that site was shut. We bought pattyhearst.com, shut it down, and then bought .org and .net, and then bought patriciahearst.org, .com, .net. 'The worst part of it was when the guy calls back and goes: \"But all the other site names have been taken!\" And my geek goes, \"Yeah! She doesn't want you reopening under another name!\"' How do you feel now that Kathy Soliah is coming to trial? 'A lot of people immediately started feeling very sorry for her because' - she assumes a breathy sincerity - 'after all, she had been living such a quiet life. I heard about her reading to the blind and all and I thought, Well, she's probably a lot nicer than I am. Who knows? But I have had to live my entire life never out of the public eye and without public scrutiny because of her actions, and the actions of the Harrises, and the rest of the SLA members, and I just didn't feel that sorry for her. There are consequences of those actions. It's no fun, is it? Thanks a lot! You should have called the police right away. But now I wish they'd never found her!' Hearst has been plunged straight back. 'I still get flashbacks. Certain smells or music or whatever. You just don't get rid of it, no matter how hard you try. Certain songs will remind me of the farmhouse in New York or Pennsylvania. I know it when I hear it. It's not like I keep a list of songs that are not allowed.' Even the shoot out flashes back. Literally. 'I have seen that shoot out used as stock footage in other films.' A yelp of outraged mirth. 'It was definitely that shoot out!' Field Marshal Cinque was right. Patricia Campbell Hearst has become Patty Hearst forever.",

      "body": "<p>As someone best known for doggedly cutting the same groove for most of his life, it's odd that John Peel seems to have been tainted with a reputation in recent years for being less or more than he seems. Why - some people demand to know - does he insist on pretending to be so modest and ordinary when everyone can see he's a famous celebrity and a national treasure with an OBE and a houseful of awards for his radio shows. And didn't the BBC commemorate his 60th birthday last year by devoting an evening's viewing to his genius and longevity? They even advertise his Radio 4 programme Home Truths on telly for goodness sake! So what is his problem? Why did he change his name? Why did he change his accent? He's not actually from Liverpool you know - somewhere much posher. And what's he doing interviewing people with terminal illnesses on Radio 4 anyway? Why can't he stick to what he's good at, playing that dreadful racket on Radio 1? </p> <p>And then there was the diatribe by Julie Burchill, who practically accused him of being a racist and a paedophile. You can't fool her with all that stuff about being champion of the musically downtrodden and a family man with a yardful of chickens. </p> <p>Peel is bewildered and hurt by stuff like this, though he says he is reluctant to protest his innocence to the point where it starts to look like guilt. He is particularly indignant at the idea that he has operated a whites-only music policy on his Radio 1 show, pointing out his long-standing passion for reggae and African music and gospel and deep soul and numerous other categories of non-whites-only music I am unfamiliar with. As for being interested in schoolgirls, well it is true that about a hundred years ago he once married a 15-year-old by accident, but, come on, that could have happened to anyone - especially in the 60s. </p> <p>'A lot of the things Julie Burchill writes I kind of agree with,' he says gloomily. 'But then she goes off on one, and it kind of undervalues all the other stuff she's written. I hate being misrepresented.' He feels the same way about those who seek to expose the 'sham' of his ordinariness. 'I was enraged once when someone wrote that I lived in a grand country house and drove a fast foreign sports car. Well, yes, this house is in the country and it's nice but it's hardly grand. And I was driving a Volkswagen Scirocco at the time..' I can vouch for the house. We're sitting in his kitchen at what he likes to call 'Peel Acres', a rambling thatched farmhouse in Suffolk. Nice bit of land attached. Bernard the dog sniffs about. Peel's wife Sheila flits backwards and forwards, dispensing drinks, tossing salad for lunch, Peel is slobbing about in a 'King of the Surf Guitar' T-shirt, jeans and faded orange socks that you couldn't fake if you wanted to. Two of the kids are upstairs with hangovers. The football (Italy v Turkey) starts in half an hour. A perfect Sunday. </p> <p>So far, so ordinary. But then in the middle of our cheese and hummus someone from The Guardian rings and wants to know about Peel having sex with Germaine Greer in the days of black-and-white television. Sheila rolls her eyes. 'I wouldn't mind, but he was supposed to be going out with me at the time,' she complains, though only in the way you might complain about someone walking mud into the kitchen. </p> <p>'Well it was the era of free love and all that,' says Peel after taking the call. 'Besides, Germaine Greer was sleeping with everyone famous. It just happened to be my night after George Best.' He goes on to recall, with Sheila's passing help, an occasion aeons ago during his programme at Broadcasting House when the two of them nipped off for a swift shag between records, only to appear in the Daily Something-or-other 25 years later. 'The trouble is the tabloids dredge up these stories and write them up as if it happened yesterday,' says Sheila. 'Another beer?' </p> <p> You could construe Peel's willingness to volunteer information and answer questions that haven't quite been asked as either ingenuousness or calculation, though it strikes me that his candour is part of his determination to be ordinary, or at least not grand. We could be just gossiping down the pub. Of course, in this, I am being invited to be ordinary, too, though I am rather spoiling the effect by ungraciously scribbling into a notebook. Peel doesn't seem to mind. He is now too busy telling me that about his passion for tikka masala curry paste, which you're supposed to cook with, but which he smears on everything. 'Except cereal, obviously,' he says. 'That would be an affectation.' </p> <p>He is funny. We pass seamlessly on to Sheila's brain haemorrhage four years ago, which turned Peel's world upside down, not least, it seems, because she is his personal organiser. 'I was terrified we'd lose her knowledge of phone numbers,' he says in that deadpan way he has of reducing every utterance to the same comic denominator, a device I've noticed he uses when he's interviewing victims of unspeakable tragedy on Home Truths. 'I find that if you can introduce a moment of tasteless levity, people are extraordinarily grateful. Sometimes I think, have I gone too far? But I don't think I have done yet.' </p> <p>But saying what he thinks without wondering what might happen next landed Peel in domestic strife during last year's birthday celebrations, when in the middle of a TV interview he talked with unusual intensity about the problem of his struggle to persuade his eldest son William to tidy his pigsty of a bedroom. When the show was eventually broadcast, William didn't take it well ('You fucking bastard!') and a contrite Peel was moved to publicly apologise on air. I remember that his original comments struck me as a touching attempt to reach his son when everything else had failed - the equivalent of leaving your diary open for someone to see. But Peel says it started as an innocent conversation between himself and the director. 'I knew the camera was running,' he says, 'but once they'd edited his bit out, it turned into this 20-minute hymn of hate.' He still feels bad about it. </p> <p>But that's where ordinariness gets you. </p> <p>We've just got time to take a stroll round his patch of England before kick-off. It's very peaceful. They bought the house for \u00a310,250 in the early 70s and expanded gradually as their four children came along (all now strapping young adults aged 18 to 24), knocking through into the cottage next door, buying a field off a neighbouring farmer. Peel had a tennis court put in from the money he made as 'the voice of Andrex' and there's a swimming pool, too (no, not Olympic size), Sheila's vegetable plot and, yes, chickens. He admits he suffers 'middle-class guilt' at being able to take the dog for a walk without leaving the garden, though I can't help thinking it's not something most people would beat themselves up about. And he does work from here, too, sifting through a huge daily mailbag of tapes and CDs, broadcasting live on Thursdays from a room at the back. And half the house is crammed with his records and clutter. </p> <p>It's not a point of dispute, though, that Peel is a class traitor of the socially downward kind. Brought up by nannies, he didn't meet his father until he was six. He was sent away at seven to boarding school and later to Shrewsbury public school. There wasn't much quality time involved. There wasn't much love. So he was attracted by affection wherever he found it. 'I suppose I was aspirant working class in a way. The kind of working class I knew seemed to be warmer, more considerate. My parents and their friends were part of a culture and society in which being rather brittle and amusing and destructive was seen as all there was. The clever put-down was very much a part of it. My dad would always introduce me like [assumes Captain Mainwaring voice], \"Ah, this is John - John's the family idiot\". I don't think he meant it unkindly, but of course you come to believe it. I was envious of the relationship Sheila had with her dad - they were very playful, obviously fond of each other and teased each other. And I just thought God that's great...' </p> <p>Sheila (n\u00e9e Gilhooly) comes from a close-knit Catholic family in Yorkshire. In fact she comes from the same small town as me. Peel loves it there. It seems that while I was busy fleeing to London in the 70s, he was busy discovering its ordinariness and warmth, or at least the ordinariness and warmth of Sheila's relatives. </p> <p>He looks at his watch. 'Shall we, er...' </p> <p> We head inside for the footie. I risk another beer and Peel pours a glass of red wine and tells an anecdote about some terrible cheapskate Radio 1 football competition during which he was trapped in a Gothenberg hotel with a flatulent prizewinner with whom he had to share a room, and a gang of English hooligans who ate all the goldfish from the tank in the breakfast lounge. Sheila berates the referee. Italy win 2-1. I have to ring home to say I'm running slightly late due to being looked after too well. By the time I put the phone down, Peel is asleep in the chair. </p> <p>Sheila sighs as if he's such an embarrassment, and takes me out to see his old white Chevrolet hidden away in the garage - a ridiculously huge thing with a boot the size of nearby Ipswich - followed by an inspection of his seven-inch singles, which he started keeping in the stable after the horse died. Eventually, Peel comes out bleary-eyed. </p> <p>' John...' says Sheila reproachfully. </p> <p>'What? I only had one-and-a-half glasses,' he says, pleading tiredness after driving back from a wedding yesterday. </p> <p>We sit out in the open air for a while talking about children. (For the record, I've edited mine out.) As you might expect, Peel is as laid-back a father as a teenager could wish to not get on with, with mellow views on education ('I always told them that passing exams and going to university was a good way of getting out of Stowmarket') and drugs ('You have to have a practical attitude. You're not going to stop them doing teenage things unless you're fantastically severe and brutal. The only thing I'd tell them is there's no quality control, so the one time you try drug X could be the time that it really messes you up'). In view of his slightly non-interventionist childcare policy, I'm surprised he gave his eldest so much grief about his room - especially when you see the state of Peel's own working environment. Ah, yes, well. He points out that he can't possibly keep pace with all the boxes of tapes and CDs that flood in. Even so, I remember seeing Andy Kershaw in a TV interview telling how a woman from the BBC's premises department once came storming in complaining that Peel's studio contravened the Health and Safety at Work Act. </p> <p>But back to bedrooms. 'The thing is,' he says, 'I suppose I used to go to a lot of trouble to find things for the children that I thought they would like and be interested in or amused by - CDs or whatever. You'd give them these things and you'd find them just stirred into the soup on the floor. It's really not much more than that.' </p> <p>But did it not occur to him that the poor boy might merely have finally discovered a way of rebelling after years of being allowed to smoke dope, not to do his homework and play thrash techno speed metal at full volume whenever he wanted? </p> <p>'Well, yes, but you always hope that your relationships with your children will be better than that. Actuarialy speaking, I've got something like seven or eight years of life left. I just want to have got this sorted out before I go. I suppose I want my children to have the same sort of relationship with me as Sheila had with her dad. Sorry - opportunity for a bit of cheap psychology there.' </p> <p>He's looking at his watch. He's quite interested in seeing the next match. 'Maybe if we just turned the sound down?' </p> <p>I sit with my back to the TV and ask if he rebelled against his own parents while France and Denmark warm up. 'Rebellion wasn't really an option,' he says. 'We had no options at all - we were on tramlines. School, university, the Kenya Rifles, the family business. The only way you could break the cycle was by failing. It seemed very much predestined. But I have a school photograph. We were all in blue Sunday suits and mine was infinitesimally lighter than the standard suit - and double- breasted. It did set me apart. And when rock'n'roll came along I went down Scotland Road - a notoriously dangerous thoroughfare in Liverpool - and bought a pair of lime green socks and drainpipe trousers. I never wore them of course. But I knew they were there hanging up in the cupboard and that was enough.' </p> <p>Yes! Just like the white Chevy under a tarpaulin in the garage. A hidden symbol of being more interesting than you might think. But then we already know this from Peel's chosen career of playing the kind of music that turns the heads of more conventionally ordinary people in the same bemused, or even irritated, way that a white Chevy or lime green socks might. So he hardly flaunts his interestingness, unless playing it down is as much a form of flaunting as playing up his ordinariness. I've noticed he is in the habit of telling interviewers that he resembles a mini-cab driver, which though perfectly accurate starts to look something like insistence when you see it in all the cuttings. He's not so ordinary that he doesn't know what he looks like. You don't get mini cab drivers saying they look like mini cab drivers. </p> <p> After having a childhood without options, he says he wouldn't choose to live in London because 'there are too many options'. And if 30 years in the same job isn't being on tramlines I don't know what is. He agrees. 'You could say it shows a shocking lack of ambition,' he says, adding that he probably got his OBE for the same reason that school crossing keepers get theirs. Though it is his genuine passion for successive waves of new music that has ensured his tenure in that late slot on Radio 1, which he is still doing three times a week. There's nothing ordinary about enjoying music made in someone's bedroom by people called Extreme Noise Terror. There's nothing ordinary about a Japanese band called Melt Banana whose shriek-filled compositions are over and done within 12 seconds. You can tell Peel relishes the non-ordinary bits of his life, the bits that set him apart: the broadcast he does for a Finnish station that used to have a show called The Fuck Shit Programme; his ambition to one day play the steel guitar; his eight-CD box set of Lonnie Donegan that he paid for himself (\u00a3132). </p> <p>And then there's his love of football. (Peel is a Liverpool fan, though at the moment there is a large '4-2' painted in blue Duluxe on the side of the house to celebrate Ipswich's - Sheila's team - victory over Barnsley.) Of course the game has been adopted by the middle classes now, but when Peel was a teenager in the 50s, football was possibly the oikiest thing you could imagine a boy doing, short of slashing cinema seats and stealing lead off the church roof. He says he used to go to a working-class boys' club in a rundown part of the city. 'I loved it. Because when I turned up the kids there were always so genuinely pleased to see me. I supported Liverpool, I knew about football, and this place had two indoor pitches. They used to take the piss out of my posh accent but they were really kind to me.' </p> <p>It was an attachment that his parents found incomprehensible. 'For a long time they assumed the only reason I was going there was because I had some kind of yearning for these young kids...' </p> <p>He's got one eye on the telly. 'That's one-nil now, it's got to be...' he murmurs. </p> <p>'Hang on, what do you mean yearning ?' </p> <p>'Well, my mother told me a few years before she died that she and my father thought I wanted to shag little boys.' </p> <p>Well I can imagine the parents not being too thrilled about young master Ravenscroft (Peel's real name) mixing with grubby scallies, but child molesting? Did it not strike him as odd that they should put such an extravagantly sordid construction on events? </p> <p>'You've got to remember it was a culture where it was regarded as excessively strange if you showed any affection for your wife, or your children,' he says. </p> <p>Peel suffers no such inhibitions, as anyone will know who has listened to the unfolding weekly mini drama from 'Peel Acres' during his broadcasts - a tale of ordinary folk, in which his devotion to hearth, home and especially his wife 'Pig' have become staples of his shows on both Radio 1 and 4. 'I probably show too much affection. But it's how I feel. I do adore Sheila. I can't imagine what I would have done if I'd not met her.' </p> <p>We start getting on to the subject of Sheila's brain haemorrhage, which still sometimes keeps him awake at night with terror, even though he knows 'she is no more likely to have another brain haemorrhage than she was to have the first'. I have read that Peel can get teary in less provocative circumstances than this (and I hate to see a man cry when he's trying to watch a football match), so I hang a sharp left into Home Truths, which seems to me to have all the ingredients of a disaster - ie the involvement of the general public - and yet it succeeds, partly because of the editing and research that goes into unearthing those stories (last week there was a riveting account of a man who had to have his lung collapsed in a rare operation to rid himself of clammy hands). Chiefly, though, I think it's Peel who makes the programme what it is by making himself seem a natural part of that ordinariness, even down to his deliberately unprofessional interviewing style, which he makes sound like two people talking on the bus. </p> <p>'I try not to make it too questiony,' he says. 'But sometimes they can be really stressful. I had to do one when our Tom was waiting for his A-level results with a woman who the year before had been waiting for her son's A-level results to come through and he'd been killed in a car crash. And they got a letter offering him a place at the university he wanted to go to. She was terribly good about it. I was the one who was howling. I had to keep stopping the interview, saying \"look I'm awfully sorry I can't go on\". She was saying \"never mind, you'll be all right soon\".' </p> <p>Some people, I say, are uncomfortable with hearing about tragedy and toenail clippings on the same show. 'I like mixing things up,' he says. 'It's the same with the music on the Radio 1 programmes - having some kind of banjo thing, then going straight into a drum and bass. If the people I'm talking to about cancer or missing children objected to being placed in the context of toenail clippings I wouldn't dream of doing it, but they like the programme by and large, and feel they'll be treated fairly on it.' </p> <p>On TV the crowd are doing a Mexican wave. He sighs. 'That's always a bad sign, isn't it? At the wedding yesterday they started to do a Mexican wave round the table.' </p> <p>'Did you join in?' </p> <p>'No. I did feel a bit snooty about not doing it,' he says. 'But you've got to have some principles.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "As someone best known for doggedly cutting the same groove for most of his life, it's odd that John Peel seems to have been tainted with a reputation in recent years for being less or more than he seems. Why - some people demand to know - does he insist on pretending to be so modest and ordinary when everyone can see he's a famous celebrity and a national treasure with an OBE and a houseful of awards for his radio shows. And didn't the BBC commemorate his 60th birthday last year by devoting an evening's viewing to his genius and longevity? They even advertise his Radio 4 programme Home Truths on telly for goodness sake! So what is his problem? Why did he change his name? Why did he change his accent? He's not actually from Liverpool you know - somewhere much posher. And what's he doing interviewing people with terminal illnesses on Radio 4 anyway? Why can't he stick to what he's good at, playing that dreadful racket on Radio 1? And then there was the diatribe by Julie Burchill, who practically accused him of being a racist and a paedophile. You can't fool her with all that stuff about being champion of the musically downtrodden and a family man with a yardful of chickens. Peel is bewildered and hurt by stuff like this, though he says he is reluctant to protest his innocence to the point where it starts to look like guilt. He is particularly indignant at the idea that he has operated a whites-only music policy on his Radio 1 show, pointing out his long-standing passion for reggae and African music and gospel and deep soul and numerous other categories of non-whites-only music I am unfamiliar with. As for being interested in schoolgirls, well it is true that about a hundred years ago he once married a 15-year-old by accident, but, come on, that could have happened to anyone - especially in the 60s. 'A lot of the things Julie Burchill writes I kind of agree with,' he says gloomily. 'But then she goes off on one, and it kind of undervalues all the other stuff she's written. I hate being misrepresented.' He feels the same way about those who seek to expose the 'sham' of his ordinariness. 'I was enraged once when someone wrote that I lived in a grand country house and drove a fast foreign sports car. Well, yes, this house is in the country and it's nice but it's hardly grand. And I was driving a Volkswagen Scirocco at the time..' I can vouch for the house. We're sitting in his kitchen at what he likes to call 'Peel Acres', a rambling thatched farmhouse in Suffolk. Nice bit of land attached. Bernard the dog sniffs about. Peel's wife Sheila flits backwards and forwards, dispensing drinks, tossing salad for lunch, Peel is slobbing about in a 'King of the Surf Guitar' T-shirt, jeans and faded orange socks that you couldn't fake if you wanted to. Two of the kids are upstairs with hangovers. The football (Italy v Turkey) starts in half an hour. A perfect Sunday. So far, so ordinary. But then in the middle of our cheese and hummus someone from The Guardian rings and wants to know about Peel having sex with Germaine Greer in the days of black-and-white television. Sheila rolls her eyes. 'I wouldn't mind, but he was supposed to be going out with me at the time,' she complains, though only in the way you might complain about someone walking mud into the kitchen. 'Well it was the era of free love and all that,' says Peel after taking the call. 'Besides, Germaine Greer was sleeping with everyone famous. It just happened to be my night after George Best.' He goes on to recall, with Sheila's passing help, an occasion aeons ago during his programme at Broadcasting House when the two of them nipped off for a swift shag between records, only to appear in the Daily Something-or-other 25 years later. 'The trouble is the tabloids dredge up these stories and write them up as if it happened yesterday,' says Sheila. 'Another beer?' You could construe Peel's willingness to volunteer information and answer questions that haven't quite been asked as either ingenuousness or calculation, though it strikes me that his candour is part of his determination to be ordinary, or at least not grand. We could be just gossiping down the pub. Of course, in this, I am being invited to be ordinary, too, though I am rather spoiling the effect by ungraciously scribbling into a notebook. Peel doesn't seem to mind. He is now too busy telling me that about his passion for tikka masala curry paste, which you're supposed to cook with, but which he smears on everything. 'Except cereal, obviously,' he says. 'That would be an affectation.' He is funny. We pass seamlessly on to Sheila's brain haemorrhage four years ago, which turned Peel's world upside down, not least, it seems, because she is his personal organiser. 'I was terrified we'd lose her knowledge of phone numbers,' he says in that deadpan way he has of reducing every utterance to the same comic denominator, a device I've noticed he uses when he's interviewing victims of unspeakable tragedy on Home Truths. 'I find that if you can introduce a moment of tasteless levity, people are extraordinarily grateful. Sometimes I think, have I gone too far? But I don't think I have done yet.' But saying what he thinks without wondering what might happen next landed Peel in domestic strife during last year's birthday celebrations, when in the middle of a TV interview he talked with unusual intensity about the problem of his struggle to persuade his eldest son William to tidy his pigsty of a bedroom. When the show was eventually broadcast, William didn't take it well ('You fucking bastard!') and a contrite Peel was moved to publicly apologise on air. I remember that his original comments struck me as a touching attempt to reach his son when everything else had failed - the equivalent of leaving your diary open for someone to see. But Peel says it started as an innocent conversation between himself and the director. 'I knew the camera was running,' he says, 'but once they'd edited his bit out, it turned into this 20-minute hymn of hate.' He still feels bad about it. But that's where ordinariness gets you. We've just got time to take a stroll round his patch of England before kick-off. It's very peaceful. They bought the house for \u00a310,250 in the early 70s and expanded gradually as their four children came along (all now strapping young adults aged 18 to 24), knocking through into the cottage next door, buying a field off a neighbouring farmer. Peel had a tennis court put in from the money he made as 'the voice of Andrex' and there's a swimming pool, too (no, not Olympic size), Sheila's vegetable plot and, yes, chickens. He admits he suffers 'middle-class guilt' at being able to take the dog for a walk without leaving the garden, though I can't help thinking it's not something most people would beat themselves up about. And he does work from here, too, sifting through a huge daily mailbag of tapes and CDs, broadcasting live on Thursdays from a room at the back. And half the house is crammed with his records and clutter. It's not a point of dispute, though, that Peel is a class traitor of the socially downward kind. Brought up by nannies, he didn't meet his father until he was six. He was sent away at seven to boarding school and later to Shrewsbury public school. There wasn't much quality time involved. There wasn't much love. So he was attracted by affection wherever he found it. 'I suppose I was aspirant working class in a way. The kind of working class I knew seemed to be warmer, more considerate. My parents and their friends were part of a culture and society in which being rather brittle and amusing and destructive was seen as all there was. The clever put-down was very much a part of it. My dad would always introduce me like [assumes Captain Mainwaring voice], \"Ah, this is John - John's the family idiot\". I don't think he meant it unkindly, but of course you come to believe it. I was envious of the relationship Sheila had with her dad - they were very playful, obviously fond of each other and teased each other. And I just thought God that's great...' Sheila (n\u00e9e Gilhooly) comes from a close-knit Catholic family in Yorkshire. In fact she comes from the same small town as me. Peel loves it there. It seems that while I was busy fleeing to London in the 70s, he was busy discovering its ordinariness and warmth, or at least the ordinariness and warmth of Sheila's relatives. He looks at his watch. 'Shall we, er...' We head inside for the footie. I risk another beer and Peel pours a glass of red wine and tells an anecdote about some terrible cheapskate Radio 1 football competition during which he was trapped in a Gothenberg hotel with a flatulent prizewinner with whom he had to share a room, and a gang of English hooligans who ate all the goldfish from the tank in the breakfast lounge. Sheila berates the referee. Italy win 2-1. I have to ring home to say I'm running slightly late due to being looked after too well. By the time I put the phone down, Peel is asleep in the chair. Sheila sighs as if he's such an embarrassment, and takes me out to see his old white Chevrolet hidden away in the garage - a ridiculously huge thing with a boot the size of nearby Ipswich - followed by an inspection of his seven-inch singles, which he started keeping in the stable after the horse died. Eventually, Peel comes out bleary-eyed. ' John...' says Sheila reproachfully. 'What? I only had one-and-a-half glasses,' he says, pleading tiredness after driving back from a wedding yesterday. We sit out in the open air for a while talking about children. (For the record, I've edited mine out.) As you might expect, Peel is as laid-back a father as a teenager could wish to not get on with, with mellow views on education ('I always told them that passing exams and going to university was a good way of getting out of Stowmarket') and drugs ('You have to have a practical attitude. You're not going to stop them doing teenage things unless you're fantastically severe and brutal. The only thing I'd tell them is there's no quality control, so the one time you try drug X could be the time that it really messes you up'). In view of his slightly non-interventionist childcare policy, I'm surprised he gave his eldest so much grief about his room - especially when you see the state of Peel's own working environment. Ah, yes, well. He points out that he can't possibly keep pace with all the boxes of tapes and CDs that flood in. Even so, I remember seeing Andy Kershaw in a TV interview telling how a woman from the BBC's premises department once came storming in complaining that Peel's studio contravened the Health and Safety at Work Act. But back to bedrooms. 'The thing is,' he says, 'I suppose I used to go to a lot of trouble to find things for the children that I thought they would like and be interested in or amused by - CDs or whatever. You'd give them these things and you'd find them just stirred into the soup on the floor. It's really not much more than that.' But did it not occur to him that the poor boy might merely have finally discovered a way of rebelling after years of being allowed to smoke dope, not to do his homework and play thrash techno speed metal at full volume whenever he wanted? 'Well, yes, but you always hope that your relationships with your children will be better than that. Actuarialy speaking, I've got something like seven or eight years of life left. I just want to have got this sorted out before I go. I suppose I want my children to have the same sort of relationship with me as Sheila had with her dad.

It was given an over-16 certificate, with the proviso that it carry a warning about 'an uninterrupted sequence of particularly crude sex, and images of particular violence that could profoundly disturb audiences'. This wasn't warning enough for the far-right pressure group Promouvoir, which has forced the state council to overturn the classification and withdraw the film. Jean-Luc Godard and Claire Denis, among others, have joined a demonstration outside the MK2 Od\u00e9on cinema, which has refused to stop screening the film. Its two female directors, Virginie Despentes and ex-porn star Coralie Trinh Thi, claim that the decision amounts to a revival of post-war censorship. </p> <p><b> But aren't the French quite 'comme ci, comme \u00e7a' about this sort of thing?</b> They were - but Paris film-makers are now worried that a precedent has been set whereby far-right-wing groups can dictate content.

Bizarrely, there is a plan to change the title to Rape me , which is deemed less controversial. Managing director Will Clarke believes that 'films like this can perform an important function' but have to be 'decent artistically'. </p> <p><b> So is it a quality piece of work, 'artistically' done?</b> Apparently not - it was universally panned by the French press.

      "bodyText": "Qu'est-ce que c'est que \u00e7a? A French film that's causing no end of a commotion in the caf\u00e9s of Paris and which has become a major embarrassment for the French government. Tell me more. Well, Baise-moi means 'fuck me' and tells the tale of two women who go on the rampage after one is brutally raped and the other witnesses a violent shooting. It was given an over-16 certificate, with the proviso that it carry a warning about 'an uninterrupted sequence of particularly crude sex, and images of particular violence that could profoundly disturb audiences'. This wasn't warning enough for the far-right pressure group Promouvoir, which has forced the state council to overturn the classification and withdraw the film. Jean-Luc Godard and Claire Denis, among others, have joined a demonstration outside the MK2 Od\u00e9on cinema, which has refused to stop screening the film. Its two female directors, Virginie Despentes and ex-porn star Coralie Trinh Thi, claim that the decision amounts to a revival of post-war censorship. But aren't the French quite 'comme ci, comme \u00e7a' about this sort of thing? They were - but Paris film-makers are now worried that a precedent has been set whereby far-right-wing groups can dictate content. The affair has also upset the culture minister, Catherine Tasca, who'd cleared Baise-moi for over-16s on the advice of the censorship board, which included church advisers. Will we be able to see what all the fuss is about? Certainly - British film distributors Optimum are in negotiations. Bizarrely, there is a plan to change the title to Rape me , which is deemed less controversial. Managing director Will Clarke believes that 'films like this can perform an important function' but have to be 'decent artistically'. So is it a quality piece of work, 'artistically' done? Apparently not - it was universally panned by the French press. The directors must be relieved by Promouvoir's intervention.",

The big question is whether you will feel \u00a3750 better off by 2004. </p> <p>Since a huge chunk of the money is going to education, you are more likely to notice it if you have children. Of the total \u00a343 billion public spending plans announced last Tuesday, more than a quarter - \u00a312bn - is going that way. Many educationalists have responded with delight. Extra money to universities may stave off the need to increase fees for undergraduates. And a typical secondary school in England will see its direct government funding rise from \u00a340,000 to \u00a360,000 next year. </p> <p>School heads have a much freer rein in deciding how to spend this direct funding than they have with the money they get from the local education authorities, their main source of funding. Many heads are likely to spend it on repairing their dilapidated buildings. Much of this \u00a312bn will be spent compensating for a period of very tight financing after Labour took office. </p> <p>As with education, much of the other spending will be catching up after a period of austerity. The 4,000 new police officers will merely restore numbers to 1993 staffing levels - 128,000. </p> <p>Even so, we are all likely to benefit from this large injection of public spending, says Carl Emmerson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies. 'It is inconceivable that there won't be an improvement in public services,' he says. The more open question for him is when these improvements will show through. It could be that there is little noticeable difference in some areas for the first couple of years - road-building, for example, or the \u00a3270m going towards starting banking services in post offices. </p> <p>But the Chancellor's speech is just as interesting for the areas he neglected. 'It doesn't augur very well for pensioners,' says Mervyn Kohler of Help the Aged. 'The Chancellor's ann ouncements were about how we carve up the growing wealth of the nation. But where were pensioners? There was a deafening silence.' </p> <p>The spending review would not have been the place for an announcement on increases in the basic state pension, for instance - since that rise is usually part of November's 'uprating statement' or possibly included in the Budget - but commentators were surprised that Brown did not make more encouraging noises to this important part of the electorate. </p> <p>But there will be more news for the elderly later this week when the Department of Health unveils the way it will use its extra \u00a313bn allocation. Plans will include, in the Chancellor's words, a 'major package of investment in services for elderly people - including the Government's response to the Royal Commission on Long-Term Care'. </p> <p>Help the Aged and Age Concern suspect that this announcement will be less generous than the solutions suggested by the Royal Commission. If the Government were launching a very attractive package, it would probably have made the announcement separately in order to reap the political benefits rather than let it be wrapped up in general news about the future of the National Health Service. </p> <p>Also disappointed were representatives of those on low incomes and benefit claimants. While the Chancellor announced a 0.75 per cent increase for social security payments, over and above inflation, this is more projection than plan. Social security rises are announced on a yearly basis, usually in an uprating statement in November. </p> <p>But Martin Barnes of the Child Poverty Action Group feels that more should still have been said last week: 'If the Government cannot be more radical at this time - given the buoyant economy - whenever can it be radical? This is a golden opportunity to tackle poverty once and for all. We are concerned that in recent months some Ministers have seemed embarrassed to talk about poverty.' </p> <p>But Barnes expects that the November statement could be 'like a mini-Budget for social security'. He believes political pragmatism will encourage Brown to announce an above-inflation increase in the basic state pension. </p> <p>But will the \u00a343bn lead to inflation and to increases interest rates?

She hoped to find work in a township but had nothing lined up: 'I went out not knowing what to expect.' She landed up in Ivory Park, a large township between Johannesburg and Pretoria, managing a project to transform tin shacks into homes. They completed 450 in a year. But then funding ran out and she felt that because of the political tension she should return home. </p> <p>Sheila now has a six-year contract working on urban regeneration in Salford but earns \u00a32,000 a year less than the housing association paid, with no company car or health insurance. Her budget is tight because, while abroad, she earned a local wage and her debts, including \u00a35,300 on her Visa card, grew. </p> <p>Her main worry is her own housing. When a relationship broke up some years ago, she had to sell a jointly-owned semi, leaving insufficient funds to buy a place on her own. So she chose a two-bedroomed flat on a shared equity basis. She bought half the flat in 1989 for \u00a324,500 with a \u00a35,000 deposit. Four years ago, she borrowed another \u00a36,000 to put in a new bathroom and kitchen. 'I have no desire to move but I am contemplating whether to buy the other half or perhaps an additional quarter share.' </p> <p>She is not convinced this is right, given her earnings and debts, but fears it will become too expensive if she delays: 'The price of the additional share will rise, as flat prices in Manchester are fairly buoyant.' </p> <p>Buying more would push up her mortgage repayments but reduce the rent on the remainder. She also has to pay for the valuation and remortgaging costs but can offset the money spent on improvements. Another option is to keep just half and buy a small investment property to rent out. </p> <p>Housing is not the only call on her spare money: 'I would like to pay some extra money into my pension and clear my credit card bill.' She also owes her parents \u00a31,500; \u00a3750 to a previous employer for half the course fees for an uncompleted masters degree, and \u00a3200 a month for her car for the next three years. </p> <p>She wonders if she should pay the National Insurance contributions she missed while abroad. 'My desire is to get back into overseas development work, perhaps in a position which allows me to continue to live in the UK or an overseas job that pays me sufficiently to allow me to keep my home in the UK without having to rent it out.' But, realistically, she says: 'Both options will be difficult to achieve, as salaries in the sector are poor and because I went into this line of work late in life at the age of 38.'</p> <p><strong>Adviser 1: Danielle Leich</strong></p> <p>Purchasing the remaining half of her flat doubles Sheila's outgoings - a big jump for anyone - but she can afford another quarter share and to repay her debts faster.

      "body": "<p>Before you head for the summer sales, think about providing a little retail therapy to your favourite charities as well by taking out one of the many fee-free charity credit cards. Provided you pay your bill off in full every month, it won't cost you a penny. And you'll get a warm glow from knowing that every time you use it the card issuer is adding to the \u00a333 million that these cards have raised for charitable causes over the last decade. </p> <p>The most successful in the world,according to the Guinness Book of Records, is the Halifax Visa Charity Card, which since its launch in 1988 has donated \u00a36.4m to the Imperial Cancer Research Fund, \u00a33m to the British Heart Foundation and \u00a32.7m to Mencap (customers choose which charity to support when they apply for a card). </p> <p>Even if you use a charity card only once, the charities involved will receive a one-off donation of anything from \u00a31 to \u00a310 (see table). <a href=\"http://www.cooperativebank.co.uk\">The Co-op</a>, for example, doubles its initial donation of \u00a35 to for some of its cards if you apply online.</p> <p>But what charities really benefit from is the steady income they get in the form of a percentage of the amount spent on the card. The most generous is People's Bank, which donates 60p to Comic Relief for every \u00a3100 spent on its Little Red Card. The United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef) gets 50p per \u00a3100 while most other charities receive 25p. HSBC, meanwhile, gives the National Trust 5p per transaction. </p> <p>American Express doesn't issue a charity card as such but lets Amex cardholders convert their membership reward points into a cash donation to the Save the Children Fund - a scheme that has earned the charity \u00a3500,000 in the last four years. </p> <p> <strong> Save... and let a charity prosper</strong> </p> <p> Your savings can earn charities extra donations, too. For example, each time a customer opens a Call Direct account - which pays 6.8 per cent on balances of \u00a32,500 and above - the Chelsea Building Society (0800 169 1076) donates \u00a31 to Shelter. Until 31 July, Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester (0800 717505) will give \u00a31 to the National Trust Neptune Coastline Campaign when any of its UK-based savings accounts is opened - new customers will also receive two free admission tickets to most National Trust properties. </p> <p>People with savings of at least \u00a31,000 can earn 6.55 per cent and a modest donation by Bristol &amp; West (0845 111 0114) to Challenging Childhood Cancer and Leukaemia. Customers also have the option of adding to the \u00a3250,000 that Bristol &amp; West is committed to raising by donating the interest earned on a CLIC Easy Access Account. Birmingham Midshires (0845 602 1318) is hoping to raise \u00a3750,000 for the British Heart Foundation and has kick-started the campaign by donating \u00a350,000. The remainder will be raised through staff fundraising events and customers donating 5 per cent of interest earned on its Heartbeat Account, which requires a minimum balance of \u00a31,000. The interest on this 30-day notice account is 5.25 per cent, rising to 5.75 per cent for savings of \u00a35,000 and above. </p> <p>You need only \u00a3500 to open a Save the Children Investment Account with the Bank of Scotland (0800 068 2500) but the interest paid is a less-than-charitable 3.5 per cent. However, you may feel it's worth it for the \u00a310 the charity gets when you open the account, as well as a donation equivalent to 0.25 per cent of your average yearly balance. </p> <p>The same percentage donation is made by the Royal Bank of Scotland (0800 121 121) to the RNLI on its 30-day notice Harbour Account, which earns the charity \u00a38,000 a year. You need \u00a3500 to open the account but it pays a reasonable 5 per cent in interest, rising to 5.25 per cent on \u00a35,000 or more. </p> <p>Three charities benefit from the Caring Saver Account from Leeds &amp; Holbeck Building Society (0500 225 777), which has so far given \u00a316,000 each to Help the Aged, Marie Curie Cancer Care and Save the Children. While the account doesn't pay huge interest (2.15 per cent on the minimum balance of \u00a3100, rising to 4.1 per cent for \u00a32,500or more), the donation is a generous 1 per cent of average yearly balances. </p> <p>The Newcastle Building Society (0191 244 2244) has two charity-related accounts: the Key Account gives 0.25 per cent of the average balance to Shelter; while Save &amp; Care, makes the same donation to Nottinghamshire Hospice. Both can be opened with \u00a31, require 30 days notice of withdrawals and pay 1.85 per cent on balances up to \u00a3100; 4.25 per cent on higher amounts. </p> <p> <strong> Make a virtue of necessity</strong> </p> <p> Next time you are shopping around for insurance, first phone a charity you support to find out about special deals. CGU donates 10 per cent to NCH Action for Children for every policy bought by the charity's regular donors. The RSPB has a similar deal for policies sold by Frizzel. RSPCA Pet Insurance (0870 242 6242) earns the charity 5 per cent of all premium income. Naturesave Policies (01803 864390) pays 10 per cent of premium income on its home and travel policies into a fund that benefits environmental and conservationist projects. </p> <p>Buying any policy from Ecclesiastical is a charitable act. As well as being charity-owned, it gives 9.5 per cent of pre-tax profits to good causes. </p> <p> <strong> Net gains</strong> </p> <p> If you're thinking of changing your internet service provider, why not switch to <a href=\"http://www.care4free.co.uk\">www.care4free.co.uk</a> an ISP dedicated to supporting charities?

'Donations' are made by posting spent ink-jet and laser cartridges using Freepost bags or address labels supplied by the charity. For more details, phone 01388 517 087 or email gedwards@rnib.org.uk. Free bulk collection can be arranged from businesses. A similar scheme raises money for Project Hope UK, which funds health projects in countries such as Malawi and Kosovo. Send any make of used cartridge (except Epson) in a plastic bag to: Accutec (Hope Appeal) Freepost ANG 2044, Harlow, Essex CM20 2YF. Alternatively, use recycling bins in charity shops.",

      "body": "<p><strong> Big Brother</strong> (C4) </p> <p> Watching Big Brother, Channel Four's new contribution to the fad for 'reality TV', the viewer is confronted with an inescapable moral question: is the prospect of winning \u00a370,000 sufficient cause to be confined in a house alongside Craig, the self-confessed 'Scouser' with a habitual impatience to remove his clothes. </p> <p>It's certainly minimal compensation for living with Caroline, the former marital aids saleswoman from Birmingham who boasts: 'People have described me as mad.' I also hesitate to put a figure on what it would require to get me under the same roof as Sada, the New Age author and aspirant yoga teacher. Whatever the amount, I'd feel short-changed. </p> <p>For Big Brother 's 10 contestants, though, it's not really about the money. Most claimed that they had submitted themselves to the invasive scrutiny of 24 round-the-clock cameras for the 'experience'. Yes, and Miss World wants to travel and help children. Clearly the motivation here is all about exposure (in Craig's case, of his penis). As Nichola, the 28-year-old 'freelance artist' from Bolton, said: 'I applied for Big Brother because I want to be famous and I want to be rich.' </p> <p>Seventy grand doesn't make you rich, but 10 weeks on TV could easily bring you fame. Traffic wardens and driving instructors have opened supermarkets on less screen time. So we understand why the participants, all previously unknown to each other, have volunteered to be holed up in a purpose-built house for as long as two- and-a-half months. </p> <p>But why should we want to watch them? Going by the first instalment, the answer patently doesn't lie in the characters themselves - five men and five women in their twenties and thirties. Most of them have a surfeit of personality but precious little natural charisma, rather as if they had borrowed their identities from soap stars. </p> <p>One of the ironies of modern media is that as it grows more and more pervasive its aim is increasingly to record unmediated experience. So television wants to show the world as it is, but the world as it is has been irreversibly warped by television. We're all performing a received version of ourselves. Which explains why the men in Big Brother mocked up an improvised basketball court, because that's what guys do when they bond together in (American) TV shows and aftershave adverts. And why Caroline's zany eccentricities are so painfully familiar. </p> <p>There was also not much to be gripped by in the social dynamics of the group. At this early stage, it's a reasonable bet that the security cameras in the forecourt of your local petrol station contain footage with more character and tension. </p> <p>Yet there is a good reason why millions of viewers will tune in. Big Brother is a guaranteed winner because each week someone loses. As far as I understand the voting system, every seven days the group members nominate two of their number to be ejected from the house and therefore ruled out from winning the prize money (which is awarded to the last person remaining at the end of the series). But the viewing public decides which of the pair actually goes. </p> <p>Thus the inhabitants are forced not only to compete among themselves for attention and popularity but also with each other for the affections of the TV audience. The scenario invites the possibility of multi-levelled deceit and duplicity, and sets up a fascinating contradiction: the group is supposed to work together on various tasks yet survival comes down to the individual. For most of the introductory episode there was scant evidence of these underlying psychodramas. We saw the men smoking and letting off wind. Craig was optimistic that his laissez-faire attitude to flatulence would prove contagious. 'Only a matter of time,' he noted, 'before the birds start farting as well.' Before that moment was to arrive, we got to listen to a different kind of feminine hot air. 'I suppose we need each other gender-wise,' said one of them, very likely Sada. </p> <p>A series of contrived set-pieces, including a 'spontaneous' truth game and a pointless pottery-making exercise, failed to reveal much about the 10, save what was immediately obvious - that Craig is eager to shed his underpants. And from four days of constant filming, the editor had his work cut out to assemble a watchable hour. </p> <p>But towards the end of the programme, Melanie, a pretty 26-year-old investment banker, and Nicholas, a terribly Fulhamish 32-year-old City broker, began to emerge as much-needed provocateurs. When Nicholas grilled Darren, a 22-year-old bachelor and father of three children, on whether he thought he had a chance of winning and if he considered himself the token black man in the team, the pretending stopped and the game began. </p> <p>Each group member gives a sort of diary testimony to camera. At Nicholas's turn, he showed an almost military appetite for the forthcoming battle. 'I think there is potentially conflict,' he declared in the methodical delivery of a group captain, 'and that will be coming down to tiredness or lack of food.' </p> <p>Nicholas and Melanie were soon discussing who they thought would be dumped first. (The hot favourite was poor Tom, a sweet-natured and taciturn Irishman, who seemed to have mistakenly wandered in from the set of One Man and His Dog ). Interestingly, once the pair had acknowledged their predicament, they almost began to forget it. Melanie, a smart operator who is not to be trusted, made the tactical error of voicing her opinion of the audience: 'I think the public are idiots,' she said. She's right, of course, but we don't necessarily like to be reminded of it. </p> <p>The flaw in reality TV, egregiously demonstrated in MTV's The Real World, is that the reality of the subject's situation - the omnipresence of TV cameras - is seldom if ever mentioned. Whereas in fact the sole reason for their particular reality is the TV cameras. </p> <p>Second-generation reality TV, or voyeur TV as it has also been called, has acknowledged the problem by adding another purpose. In the case of the BBC's Castaway 2000, it's the anthropology of the community, a millennarian attempt to forge a new beginning on a remote island. The Americans have developed their own version of Castaway, called Survivor, set on a tropical island. But they binned the idealism and replaced it with a more ratings-friendly Lord of the Flies ruthlessness, in which each week a new Piggy is booted out. </p> <p>They picked up this Darwinian twist from the egalitarian Dutch, of all people, who first came up with the format that has now been imported here as Big Brother . In Holland, where the show was something of a phenomenon, the eventual winner was a man with the improbable name of Bart Spring. Apparently he triumphed despite being deeply unpopular with his fellow house guests, although that did not prevent one of them from sleeping with him. </p> <p>Strategically speaking, sexiness, or more specifically the promise of having sex, is probably the most reliable protection against being voted off. And a sort of freshers' week spirit of carnal anticipation rather clumsily informed much of the social interaction. The question is which couple among this lot would have sex with one another, and, more intriguingly, where? By rights Craig, who sees himself as an 'entertainer' and Caroline, who is easily entertained (her diabolical cackle sounds like fingernails on a blackboard), should get together. But I for one would turn the telly off. </p> <p>Darren let himself down by placing a clay phallus outside the women's dormitory; Andrew is hardly a catch, having announced his intimate knowledge of South East Asian brothels; the razor-haired, face-pierced Nichola is too scary; Tom is too quiet; Sada has a boyfriend; and Anna, the former nun, is a lesbian ('Are you?' said Sada. 'Oh that's wonderful.') That leaves Nicholas and Melanie. </p> <p>I sense they're both canny enough to manufacture a romance, or at least a flirtation, but too smooth to let it go any further.

On my small iMac, I failed to ascertain if there is a camera in the lavatory. This information may prove crucial because at the very end of last week's episode we discovered that the group had run out of toilet paper and Big Brother was not prepared to supply them with any more.

This largesse is matched only by Barclays and NatWest - provided you add their 1999 corporate con tributions together and include non-cash donations in the form of employee time, gifts in kind and the management costs associated with their charitable activities. But the size of a donation isn't everything. A more telling measure of a company's generosity is the percentage of its profits that it is prepared to donate. The industry-led Business in the Community movement, whose mission is to inspire companies to make 'social responsibility an essential part of business excellence', sets a benchmark of 1 per cent of pre-tax profits. Using this standard, you can see why the Co-op has been commended by the BITC for its corporate generosity. But the Co-op lags behind Northern Rock which, as one of the top 10 givers in the UK, donates 5 per cent of its pre-tax profits to charitable causes. Barclays and Lloyds TSB only just exceed the 1 per cent benchmark, while NatWest and all the other banks have got a lot of catching up to do.",

She says: 'Northern Ireland has been very slow to catch up with the rest of the UK. People have had this \"grant mentality\".

Of the near 1,000 IT graduates from Northern Ireland's two universities, Queen's and Ulster, 40 per cent end up leaving Northern Ireland each year, the majority going to Dublin and England. There's a word for the latter: Nipplies - 'Northern Ireland professional people living in England'. </p> <p>A recent report by the province's Software Industry Federation, which boasts 155 member companies, concluded: 'Skill shortages are affecting the growth and development of a significant number of businesses.' </p> <p>This is putting it mildly. The brain drain has become so acute that the province's Training and Employment Agency placed ads in local papers at Christmas extolling the virtues of living in Northern Ireland in a bid to catch the eye of those returning to see their families. Further initiatives are planned. </p> <p>Some, like Maurice Mulvenna, chief executive officer of Mineit, a company which develops database software and which emerged out of Ulster University, believe the trend can be reversed. 'Look at what happened in Dublin when the Celtic tiger got up to speed. A lot of people came back. We've got the potential to draw these people back. These are people who went away many years ago, who now want to settle down, and who are already highly skilled.' </p> <p>It is not difficult to see how a return of the natives could quickly yield results. Northern Ireland, with a population of less than 2 million, is - despite or maybe because of the Troubles - a close-knit community. Ideas can be translated into practice very quickly, and new technology has the potential to help the province look outside itself in the way Dublin managed to 10 years ago. </p> <p>Johnston said: 'Everyone knows everyone. We're getting to realise that we're part of the global stage.' </p> <p>But Northern Ireland has a long way to go before it can emulate its neighbour. </p> <p>The Republic got rich acting as a magnet for technology companies who were looking to benefit from a country which had low corporation tax and a cheap workforce prepared to bolt together bits of hardware - what became known as 'screwdriver operations'.

But in the Seventies and Eighties inward investment went south.' </p> <p>Northern Ireland knows it needs to learn more from the South. Many of its staple industries are in decline. Although unemployment has been falling for several years and now stands at just over 50,000 - 7 per cent of the working population - nearly 60,000 jobs are predicted to go in the next 10 years. An authoritative report by PricewaterhouseCoopers suggests that 132,000 new jobs will have to have been created by 2010 to cater for a growing workforce.

It is an illegal activity in most countries although very difficult to prove, thank God.' Not entirely technically accurate, but we get their drift. Drunk.com We have missed the esteemed figure of former Mirror Group boss David Montgomery on the media scene. So we were beside ourselves with delight to learn of Monty's return through the magic of Yava, a new internet company that aims to put terminals in pubs - or Punch Taverns to be precise. Yava - short for You're 'AVing A laugh, aren't you? - combines that brilliant concept of placing technology in front of the inebriated, though the business model that says people will pay as much for online porn with their pint as they will for a one-armed bandit is as yet unproven. Not, of course, that the clientele of Punch Taverns will be using Yava to access porn. They will care more about the interesting features and sports coverage.",

Assembling sites - preparing them for housebuilding to proceed - is therefore time-consuming and costly. </p> <p>In his Urban Taskforce report, Lord Rogers called for the Government to give regional development agencies and local authorities souped-up powers to compulsorily purchase land in order to speed up the assembly process. </p> <p>The Government is currently studying ways of doing this but, more than a year later, it has failed to act. </p> <p>However, Anthony Dunnett, chief executive of the South-east of England Development Agency and a member of Rogers' Urban Taskforce, warns that without strong compulsory purchase order powers, the Govern ment target of building 60 per cent of new homes on previously developed land will fail. </p> <p>'The [housing] debate has been hijacked by \"Nimby\" fears and pre-election politics rather than focusing on the fundamental problem,' Dunnett says. 'The real issue is not one of numbers; rather it is one of market failure in a free-market economy.

The solution to meeting the massive housing need in the region is to build on 'infill' sites - smaller parcels of land within town and city centres. </p> <p>Housebuilders, meanwhile, are upset because they never know how many socially affordable homes to build within a housing development. New laws on the provision of affordable homes set minimum targets, but councils can order as many affordable homes as they can get away with. </p> <p>But the biggest disincentive for builders to develop brownfield sites is VAT, which is charged at 17.5 per cent on refurbishing or redeveloping existing buildings, while greenfield housebuilding is exempt. </p> <p>If the Government wanted to send out a signal that brownfield development is at the heart of its housing policy, it could start by addressing this anomaly. </p> <p>But with the Treasury recently indicating opposition to reform, those at the sharp end of regenerating Britain's towns and cities face an uphill struggle. </p> <p><strong> Government lifts roof on housing budget</strong></p> <p>Tomorrow the Government will give details on how it will spend the 12 per cent average annual increase on the housing budget over the next three years.

      "body": "<p>'Accountability for end-to-end process costs', 'integrated technology architecture based on consistent middleware, data warehousing and customer relationship management', 'integrated customer access'. If management-speak were the key to success, Alliance &amp; Leicester's 'organisational restructure' - where all these bits of jargon were coined - would ensure it was up there with the leaders. </p> <p>Scratch the surface of the management-speak, however, and A&amp;L is revealed as just another medium-sized bank desperately seeking ways to in an increasingly competitive environment. Beneath the jargon lie two old-fashioned tactics: cut costs and persuade customers to buy more. </p> <p>The strategy presentation was, however, short on detailed targets and explanations of how they would be met. We have to wait until the autumn to find out the cost-cutting targets, although the new management believes, as new managements do, that there is 'considerable scope for efficiency improvement'. </p> <p>The pledges on boosting revenue were likewise long on promise but short on detail. Instead of devising a stream of new products and persuading customers to buy them, it will now think about what its customers want to buy. It has divided the market into three types: those who will buy anything, those who will buy nothing unless they have to, and those who are sophisticated enough not to listen to the marketing speak. </p> <p>The result, says newly-appointed group managing director Peter McNamara, will be an end to the pointless quest for market share regardless of profitability - it is unlikely, for example, to increase its activity in the remortgage market. Given the high costs of winning customers, it is clearly sensible to try to do more business with current ones. But every financial services company, A&amp;L included, has been trying to do that for years.

If management-speak were the key to success, Alliance &amp; Leicester's 'organisational restructure' - where all these bits of jargon were coined - would ensure it was up there with the leaders. Scratch the surface of the management-speak, however, and A&amp;L is revealed as just another medium-sized bank desperately seeking ways to in an increasingly competitive environment. Beneath the jargon lie two old-fashioned tactics: cut costs and persuade customers to buy more. The strategy presentation was, however, short on detailed targets and explanations of how they would be met. We have to wait until the autumn to find out the cost-cutting targets, although the new management believes, as new managements do, that there is 'considerable scope for efficiency improvement'. The pledges on boosting revenue were likewise long on promise but short on detail. Instead of devising a stream of new products and persuading customers to buy them, it will now think about what its customers want to buy. It has divided the market into three types: those who will buy anything, those who will buy nothing unless they have to, and those who are sophisticated enough not to listen to the marketing speak. The result, says newly-appointed group managing director Peter McNamara, will be an end to the pointless quest for market share regardless of profitability - it is unlikely, for example, to increase its activity in the remortgage market. Given the high costs of winning customers, it is clearly sensible to try to do more business with current ones. But every financial services company, A&amp;L included, has been trying to do that for years. The test will be whether it succeeds this time. Potentially more interesting is its decision to target the small and medium-sized business market. As McNamara points out, there have been no new entrants since the Second World War.

An OFT report to be published within the next few weeks will criticise garages for doing unnecessary work but not carrying out required servicing. John Bridgeman, director- general of Fair Trading, said the OFT would uphold the concerns of consumer groups and trading standards officers, who have been highly critical of garages. The report - one of the main reports to be produced by the OFT this year - follows investigations launched into the \u00a38.9 billion car maintenance and service industry in April last year. Bridgeman pointed then to evidence of vehicles' faults either not being corrected or, worse, being introduced during servicing. The inquiry focused on how badly customers were being served; what information was available to them before servicing was carried out; how easy it was to complain and whether those complaints were dealt with properly; and how customers could best be advised on choosing a garage. Last week Bridgeman told The Observer : 'I will confirm from the work being done by the Consumers' Association that consumers are not well served in terms of standards of care offered when cars are maintained. Work which should be done is missed and and work which should not be done is done.' Bridgeman said that people were not aware of their responsibilities, and that they were not told about them by garages: 'Garages are not basically doing much to help people, and people as a result are not serving their own best interests.' On safety, he said: 'I don't think we have sufficient standards on this score.' Bridgeman added that the Government should introduce regulations to guarantee better consumer safety, saying the current government's consumer White Paper could be a missed opportunity.

      "body": "<p>Gordon Brown is no Santa Claus, contrary to what many commentators have said of last week's Spending Review 2000 festivities. As everyone knows, Santa sports an Old Labour white beard and hands out sackfuls of presents unconditionally. </p> <p>The Chancellor is much more like the tooth fairy - goodies reward departments that have gone through painful adjustments to improve their effectiveness. </p> <p>He was able to announce last Tuesday's plans because of past underspends on already-tight departmental limits, but the cash is also contingent on a raft of targets designed to improve the effectiveness of public spending. </p> <p>The injection of \u00a350.5 billion of public money will be accompanied by a 'tough regime for driving up the performance of public services', says the Government. The key elements of this regime are departmental improvement targets - for example, that 80 per cent of 11-year-olds read and write to a particular level - and new efficiency targets to cut costs. Such targets will be enshrined within Public Service Agreements to be published in a White Paper this week. </p> <p>But the effectiveness of the targets themselves is uncertain. 'If there was one target that was, say, a perfect measure of education, you could easily measure value for money,' says Carl Emmerson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies. 'The problem is there isn't, and the danger is that you introduce distortions.' </p> <p>Thus, targeting numbers on hospital waiting lists may prove detrimental to waiting times or to clinical priorities. Similarly, reducing numbers of prisoners per cell may be ranked important, but what would be the side-effects on numbers kept on remand in police cells? </p> <p>'Then if the targets have been met, what conclusion can we draw - were they too easy or were there other things that were affected?' asks Emmerson. </p> <p>Furthermore, the link between achieving targets and receiving funding is unclear. If health targets are not being met, it is highly unlikely that the Department of Health would be punished - a sharp increase in waiting lists and packed emergency wards would probably result in an increase in funding. The numbers announced in the first Comprehensive Spending Review, in 1998, turned out not to be sacrosanct. </p> <p>Spending Review 2000 is peppered with references to the use of information and communications technology, both as a tool to increase the performance and delivery of public services and as an end in itself. </p> <p>Thirteen projects and programmes mentioned in the spending review directly relate to technology, and more detail is expected in the Public Service Agreements. </p> <p>Projects include a Home Office scheme to help police analyse crime data and share it with health, education and social services, and a legal department initiative to improve information and reduce waiting times at courts.

      "bodyText": "Gordon Brown is no Santa Claus, contrary to what many commentators have said of last week's Spending Review 2000 festivities. As everyone knows, Santa sports an Old Labour white beard and hands out sackfuls of presents unconditionally. The Chancellor is much more like the tooth fairy - goodies reward departments that have gone through painful adjustments to improve their effectiveness. He was able to announce last Tuesday's plans because of past underspends on already-tight departmental limits, but the cash is also contingent on a raft of targets designed to improve the effectiveness of public spending. The injection of \u00a350.5 billion of public money will be accompanied by a 'tough regime for driving up the performance of public services', says the Government. The key elements of this regime are departmental improvement targets - for example, that 80 per cent of 11-year-olds read and write to a particular level - and new efficiency targets to cut costs. Such targets will be enshrined within Public Service Agreements to be published in a White Paper this week. But the effectiveness of the targets themselves is uncertain. 'If there was one target that was, say, a perfect measure of education, you could easily measure value for money,' says Carl Emmerson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies. 'The problem is there isn't, and the danger is that you introduce distortions.' Thus, targeting numbers on hospital waiting lists may prove detrimental to waiting times or to clinical priorities. Similarly, reducing numbers of prisoners per cell may be ranked important, but what would be the side-effects on numbers kept on remand in police cells? 'Then if the targets have been met, what conclusion can we draw - were they too easy or were there other things that were affected?' asks Emmerson. Furthermore, the link between achieving targets and receiving funding is unclear. If health targets are not being met, it is highly unlikely that the Department of Health would be punished - a sharp increase in waiting lists and packed emergency wards would probably result in an increase in funding. The numbers announced in the first Comprehensive Spending Review, in 1998, turned out not to be sacrosanct. Spending Review 2000 is peppered with references to the use of information and communications technology, both as a tool to increase the performance and delivery of public services and as an end in itself. Thirteen projects and programmes mentioned in the spending review directly relate to technology, and more detail is expected in the Public Service Agreements. Projects include a Home Office scheme to help police analyse crime data and share it with health, education and social services, and a legal department initiative to improve information and reduce waiting times at courts. The health settlement is expected to include new initiatives on smartcards. Technology, on which the Government already spends \u00a38bn a year, is intended to be the cornerstone of modernising government and increasing the effectiveness of the public sector. But the experience of last year's passport and immigration fiascos, incorrect calculation of benefits for pensioners, not to mention last week's loss of 5 million tax records, have done little to inspire confidence. A report published in January by the Public Accounts Committee, the parliamentary watchdog, detailed 25 cases over the past decade where the 'implementation of IT systems has resulted in delay, confusion and inconvenience to the citizens and, in many cases, poor value for money to the taxpayer'. For example, following the systems problems at the Passport Office last year, the unit cost of a passport was \u00a315.50 against a target of \u00a312.

At Brixton Academy, last Wednesday, however, US soul singer D'Angelo hinted at an old-school renaissance. With all the ferocity and aplomb of a set by James Brown and the JBs, D'Angelo resurrected images of New York's Apollo Theatre. </p> <p>It's odd that D'Angelo should come across like the new James Brown, because for most people he was already pigeonholed as the new Marvin Gaye. His debut album, 1995's Brown Sugar, introduced American R&amp;B to the hip-hop influences it had previously tried its best to ignore. Alongside Lauryn Hill, Angie Stone, Erykah Badu, Maxwell and Tony Rich, D'Angelo was a musical defibrillator, resuscitating a half-dead genre. Brown Sugar also showcased a prodigiously talented multi-instrumentalist - D'Angelo was credited as composer, arranger, producer and performer. He was immediately compared with Marvin Gaye (the smoothness, the voice) and Prince (the autocracy, the shortness). The Godfather of Funk wasn't even mentioned back then. </p> <p>During the five-year hiatus which followed that debut, D'Angelo kept his profile up with various guest slots on hip-hop recordings. Two such efforts in 1998 - 'Break Ups 2 Make Ups' with Method Man, and 'Nothing Even Matters' with Lauryn Hill - helped solidify his appeal to urban audiences. His latest album, this year's Voodoo , has picked up rave reviews and serious sales. In fact, it is less assured than his debut - often guilty of creating moods rather than songs. Live, however, the new material takes on another dynamic: fleshed out with horns and strings, it becomes almost animalistic. </p> <p>D'Angelo's stage presence is certainly modelled on some kind of beast. Before the concert, I'd tried to guess how many songs it would take him to remove his top: I'd gone for three. In fact, five whole tracks are played before he dives into the crowd - re-emerging a minute or so later to rip off his black vest. He looks decidedly pleased with himself for showing such restraint. </p> <p>Back on stage, his torso dripping with sweat, D'Angelo stares at the crowd like the growling, sexual embodiment of soul virility - prowling back and forth, left and right. He punches the air - slamming jabs and hooks into invisible opponents. The men in the crowd watch with awe at this public expounding of testosterone. The women scream as the singer flexes various muscle groups. In fact, the concert has all the anticipation of a hen night: fawning, fainting females scramble over each other to get near the stage. The last time I witnessed such scenes was at a Wet Wet Wet concert in Glasgow in the early Nineties. </p> <p>'My God, he's gorgeous,' coos one girl to my left. Another turns excitedly to her boyfriend, her hands clasping his waist. 'He's really good-looking, isn't he?' she gasps. 'Much better than in his videos.' The boyfriend, suddenly conscious of his own playdough physique, wriggles his way out of her hands. 'He's not all that,' is the mumbled reply. Aggrieved, he flatly refuses to dance for the remainder of the set, narrowing his eyes meanly at the stage. </p> <p>The set is elastic and a bit disjointed. New songs such as 'The Root' and 'Feel Like Makin' Love' are laboriously extended into 10-minute funk workouts. Lyrics are strangled in favour of sweaty percussive breaks. And, oddly, many songs are introduced as encores, providing a sort of perpetually delayed climax. Looking at his group - physically toned in the fine tradition of Kentucky Derby winners, but in danger of injuring themselves nevertheless - the JB comparisons are irresistible. </p> <p>Only the vocabulary is urban contemporary. 'Motherfuckers in Brixton - are you ready?' yells D'Angelo, prior to the charmingly titled song 'Shit Damn Motherfucker'. In defiance of the loverman soul conventions, he does not dedicate songs to 'all the beautiful ladies' in the audience; he just swears at them instead. </p> <p>The ladies don't seem to mind. At one point, a rapper appears onstage: he proceeds to stalk the breadth of the venue, screaming 'motherfucker' with increasing ferocity. D'Angelo looks on and beams with satisfaction. You have to wonder what his mother makes of it all. </p> <p>'See y'all next time, Brixton,' he waves as he leaves the stage. 'It's been a perplexing performance - a strange mixture of gracefulness and grunting, sensuality and swearing. Soul veterans such as Al Green and Bobby Womack often talk about finding 'the jones' - an almost spiritual fever - during concerts. D'Angelo found it repeatedly tonight. The only difference is he'd probably call it the motherfucking jones.</p>",

      "body": "<p>It's not that the new Cardiff is so much worse than any other British waterside development that makes it such a disappointment. With its walkways and its public art programme, and its new Rocco Forte hotel with a funny roof, it's perfectly adequate by the hardly exacting standards set by Wapping, say. But what's really depressing about the place is the gap between what it could have been and what it has become. </p> <p>It's the difference between Zaha Hadid's opera house that would now be preparing for its first season, if it had not been torpedoed by small-town politics and craven Millennium Commission prejudice, and the Atlantic Quay Leisure Village designed by nobody in particular, which today glowers over the entire area. </p> <p>It's the difference between the kind of dignified civic spaces that Martorell, Bohigas and Mackay, responsible for the brilliantly successful remodelling of Barcelona, envisaged for Cardiff Bay and the end-product. A confused mess, dominated by a water sculpture that looks uncomfortably like a giant version of a car-dealer's totem, signals the ingratiatingly named Mermaid Quay, infested with outposts of Break for the Border and Harry Ramsden and its not so picturesque, yellow-brick terraces trying unconvincingly to knit into the remains of the old Bute Town. </p> <p>This is not a fight between high culture and lowbrow entertainment. It's a sad example of a city that, given the choice between the second rate and the excellent, had no hesitation in grabbing the former with both hands. The Millennium Commission's legacy to Cardiff is equally disappointing. It decided it didn't much like the look of Hadid's architecture, but rather than say so in public claimed that it found the business plan unconvincing. </p> <p>This is rich coming from the same people who signed an open-ended cheque for the Millennium Dome. But it had to spend some money in Cardiff, so it backed a new rugby stadium (architects the Lobb partnersh\"p) which is now complete. With its absurdly over-excited structure, it sits on big, fat legs that rear over the surrounding streets like a sumo wrestler. It could have been so different. </p> <p>Cardiff is constantly telling the world that it is Europe's fastest growing capital city. And back in the Eighties, it adopted a bold series of plans that really did seem to live up to its boasts. The Cardiff Bay Development Corporation set out to heal the city's fractured geography with a grand strategy that seemed to stand a good chance of success.</p> <p>Cardiff is the product of its brief period of nineteenth- century prosperity, when the explosion in the coal and iron industry turned it from an overgrown village into the nearest thing Britain had seen to a gold-rush town. It was the place from which the coal hacked out of the Welsh Valleys was exported to the world and became the focus of a network of canals, dock basins and railways. </p> <p>But no sooner had it turned itself inside out to accommodate the industrial revolution than it was beached by the tide of changing trade patterns and shifting technology, the urban equivalent of a spoil tip. </p> <p>Cardiff was essentially split in two by the railway embankment built to serve the central station. To the north was the original city, its castle rebuilt in spectacular style by William Burges with some of the profits that the Marquis of Bute made from the coal trade, and a civic centre that looked a lot like a Welsh version of New Delhi with green lawns and white, stone classical architecture. </p> <p>South of the railway was Bute Town and what used to be called Tiger Bay - acres of decayed housing, empty dock basins and a few relics of industrial architecture, like the striking red terracotta Pierhead building, designed in municipal gothic style for the Cardiff Railway Company. Meanwhile, the waterfront was a tidal mud flat, stained by sewage for much of the day.</p> <p>The development corporation proposed two big moves. The first was the construction of a mile-long boulevard driving straight down to the bay, all the way from Cardiff's centre, with a high-tech tram system to get people there. The second was to make the waterfront a place that would be worth making the trip to see. Smelly mud flats were not regarded as falling into that category. Instead, a giant tidal barrier would make the whole bay into a permanent fresh-water lake. The ecologists weren't impressed, but despite their objections, the barrier is now complete. The boulevard, too, is rapidly taking shape. </p> <p>The problem with both is in the detail. The development corporation began by looking for the best advice it could find, and has since rejected almost all of it.

      "bodyText": "It's not that the new Cardiff is so much worse than any other British waterside development that makes it such a disappointment. With its walkways and its public art programme, and its new Rocco Forte hotel with a funny roof, it's perfectly adequate by the hardly exacting standards set by Wapping, say. But what's really depressing about the place is the gap between what it could have been and what it has become. It's the difference between Zaha Hadid's opera house that would now be preparing for its first season, if it had not been torpedoed by small-town politics and craven Millennium Commission prejudice, and the Atlantic Quay Leisure Village designed by nobody in particular, which today glowers over the entire area. It's the difference between the kind of dignified civic spaces that Martorell, Bohigas and Mackay, responsible for the brilliantly successful remodelling of Barcelona, envisaged for Cardiff Bay and the end-product. A confused mess, dominated by a water sculpture that looks uncomfortably like a giant version of a car-dealer's totem, signals the ingratiatingly named Mermaid Quay, infested with outposts of Break for the Border and Harry Ramsden and its not so picturesque, yellow-brick terraces trying unconvincingly to knit into the remains of the old Bute Town. This is not a fight between high culture and lowbrow entertainment. It's a sad example of a city that, given the choice between the second rate and the excellent, had no hesitation in grabbing the former with both hands. The Millennium Commission's legacy to Cardiff is equally disappointing. It decided it didn't much like the look of Hadid's architecture, but rather than say so in public claimed that it found the business plan unconvincing. This is rich coming from the same people who signed an open-ended cheque for the Millennium Dome. But it had to spend some money in Cardiff, so it backed a new rugby stadium (architects the Lobb partnersh\"p) which is now complete. With its absurdly over-excited structure, it sits on big, fat legs that rear over the surrounding streets like a sumo wrestler. It could have been so different. Cardiff is constantly telling the world that it is Europe's fastest growing capital city. And back in the Eighties, it adopted a bold series of plans that really did seem to live up to its boasts. The Cardiff Bay Development Corporation set out to heal the city's fractured geography with a grand strategy that seemed to stand a good chance of success. Cardiff is the product of its brief period of nineteenth- century prosperity, when the explosion in the coal and iron industry turned it from an overgrown village into the nearest thing Britain had seen to a gold-rush town. It was the place from which the coal hacked out of the Welsh Valleys was exported to the world and became the focus of a network of canals, dock basins and railways. But no sooner had it turned itself inside out to accommodate the industrial revolution than it was beached by the tide of changing trade patterns and shifting technology, the urban equivalent of a spoil tip. Cardiff was essentially split in two by the railway embankment built to serve the central station. To the north was the original city, its castle rebuilt in spectacular style by William Burges with some of the profits that the Marquis of Bute made from the coal trade, and a civic centre that looked a lot like a Welsh version of New Delhi with green lawns and white, stone classical architecture. South of the railway was Bute Town and what used to be called Tiger Bay - acres of decayed housing, empty dock basins and a few relics of industrial architecture, like the striking red terracotta Pierhead building, designed in municipal gothic style for the Cardiff Railway Company. Meanwhile, the waterfront was a tidal mud flat, stained by sewage for much of the day. The development corporation proposed two big moves. The first was the construction of a mile-long boulevard driving straight down to the bay, all the way from Cardiff's centre, with a high-tech tram system to get people there. The second was to make the waterfront a place that would be worth making the trip to see. Smelly mud flats were not regarded as falling into that category. Instead, a giant tidal barrier would make the whole bay into a permanent fresh-water lake. The ecologists weren't impressed, but despite their objections, the barrier is now complete. The boulevard, too, is rapidly taking shape. The problem with both is in the detail. The development corporation began by looking for the best advice it could find, and has since rejected almost all of it. The boulevard was originally designed by Martorell, Bohigas and Mackay from Barcelona. But when they tried to turn their ideas into reality, the development corporation swiftly got rid of them, watering down the boulevard into a close approximation of a by-pass and wrecking its carefully considered relationship with the waterfront. A cluster of four columns designed by David Mackay, trapped between the railway embankment, and Toys'R'Us, is all that is left of Cardiff's brave ambitions to make it into the European first division. It was the same with the tidal barrage. Will Alsop was hired to turn simple engineering into a spectacular collection of architectural follies. Predictably, he, too, has left the scene without achieving what had been promised. If you want a reminder of what Cardiff has missed, an exhibition of Hadid's work opened last week at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London.

Nowhere is the world more palpable or more grotesque, more tragic or more comic, than in Don Giovanni. The terrifying overture, lurching and swirling from bright to dark, major to minor, announces as much.

In the Fifties, the site was owned by Rudolph Palumbo, son of an Italian immigrant from Amalfi, who had started out as the owner of a greasy- spoon caf\u00e9 in Lower Thames Street and had built a vast property empire of which this site was one of unexploited gems. </p> <p>On his death in 1963, the site was inherited by his son, Peter, later Lord Palumbo, the former head of the Arts Council, who then battled for more than three decades to redevelop its Victorian shop premises into what he advertised as the 'last great landmark building of the twentieth century'. </p> <p>The original Mies van der Rohe office block proposed for the site was dismissed by Prince Charles as a disfiguring 'glass stump' and planning permission was refused. James Stirling then had a go, only for his plans to be described by the Prince of Wales as looking like 'a 1930s wireless', but eventually, after a series of appeals, a modified version of the Stirling building was accepted and construction began in 1994. </p> <p>The ancient history of the troubled site was, however, less well known, and one of the deals that allowed Palumbo finally to get a green light for his plans was his agreement to allow - and partially fund - the archaeologists of the Museum of London to excavate the building's foundations. After so many years of procrastination, it was decided that this \u00a33 million work would run concurrently with construction, so as the Stirling building advanced skywards it was supported on pilings while the archaeologists painstakingly sifted what was beneath it. </p> <p>The site was unique in the City in that unlike the surrounding vaulted banks and monumental office blocks with their deep foundations, its Victorian buildings had very shallow basements and the ancient topography of the area was therefore undisturbed. </p> <p>What also assisted in the dig was the fact that the site was on the banks of an ancient tributary of the Thames, known as Wal brook, and at depth the ground was waterlogged. The consequent absence of oxygen had served to preserve the organic material - wood and leather - found far beneath the surface and thusprovided a unique record not only of the first structures on the site, but also evidence of some of the domestic objects that give clues to daily life in that period. </p> <p>The most important finds made in nearly two years of work dated right back to the first century when the area was initially settled by other immigrants from the Italian coast. Walbrook was at the heart of Roman London and Number One, Poultry was on the northern side of the main east-west road that followed the route of Oxford Street, Holborn and Cheapside. </p> <p>The lower walls of entire buildings were uncovered - a series of timber-framed commercial structures that were discovered to be a bakery and a merchant's shop and some kind of public eating place or bar (an ancient precursor to Rudolph Palumbo's greasy spoon and Terence Conran's Le Coq D'Argent, which now occupies the penthouse floor of Stirling's building). </p> <p>These structures offered a first thrilling glimpse of the genesis of the City and exact replicas of them have now been built in the Museum of London, with help from the production company Sands Films, which specialises in period reconstructions. </p> <p>Wandering through these functional mock-ups, with their axe-cut green oak beams and their rough plaster walls, you get some real, if distant, sense of the particular foundations of the old City. Unlike any contem porary native buildings, the three shops were prefabricated; they also introduced the concept of corners to the ancient British, who had always made circular dwellings. </p> <p>They are structures that were put together to order and in a hurry; they are redolent of new ideas of mass production and efficiency. The Romans of 40AD wanted to develop London quickly as their northern trading hub and there was apparently a mini-frenzy of Docklands-style property speculation around this time. Buildings were going up everywhere as traders sought to capitalise on the arrival of goods from throughout the empire. </p> <p>Museum of London director Simon Thurley says: 'The only conceivable reason why the Romans would have attempted to create this new city in Britain was commercial [they introduced a market economy and coinage to the country] and so what you see in these preserved buildings is a vivid snapshot of something like a Wild West gold-rush town.' The Romans thus came to the original square mile for the same reason people have come to it ever since - to make money. </p> <p>The original speculators were more likely to be Britons than imperial expats - and their profit-making was short-lived (boom and bust was, from the outset, apparently in the script). The new city was partially destroyed by fire in the Boudiccan revolt in AD60, from which much of the material collected - which includes remnants of 1,250 oak timbers and more than 5,000 artefacts - originally dates. The reconstruction is the central part of a large-scale attempt to understand some of the fabric of routine lives of this crucial time in the City's genealogy - and to this end the exhibition also includes the intricate imported pottery, the carved lamp holders and the cosmetic sets (combined tweezers and ear cleaners) that were removed from the site. </p> <p>It is ironic, perhaps, or maybe fitting, that at a time when London is undergoing an almost unprecedented redevelopment, our know-ledge of its ancient past should be so enhanced. But one of the by-products of the current National Lottery-funded golden age of capital projects in London, such as the new Covent Garden and the Millennium Bridge, has been the opportunity to excavate key historical sites for the first time. </p> <p>The material collected from Number One, Poultry has thus been supplemented by evidence of some of the other spectacular discoveries of the past few years: the fourth-century sarcophagus of a Roman woman in Spitalfields, the site of an adjacent contemporary 'tower block' near the present Leadenhall Market and the remains of an enormous first-century amphitheatre under the courtyard of the Guildhall, a mile or so north-east of Poultry where the original Russell Crowes may have strutted their gory stuff. </p> <p>What these collective discoveries provide is a new vision of the first major surge of economic energy that established London as a future capital. All cities have been founded on the promise of an economic miracle.

What it lacks is an original pulse, and a dynamic leading man. </p> <p>John Dempsey and Dana P. Rowe's adaptation of the novel by John Updike - and the Jack Nicholson movie - has a good start with its unsoppy story. The Witches of Eastwick is fuelled by sex rather than sentiment: three discontented women in a small New England town discover magical powers when they conjure up a diabolic hunk, and scandalise their strait-laced neighbours. Only in Mamma Mia! have three women supposedly past their first flush been so firmly in charge of a musical. </p> <p>As the weird sisters, Lucie Arnaz, Maria Friedman and Joanna Riding are rousing: clarion-voiced and clever.

And at the end of the first half - lolling together, sated in their lover's infernal mansion - this magical trio literally take off. They rise into the air and then, thrillingly, strike out across the auditorium, floating over the heads of the audience like figureheads tugging an invisible ship. </p> <p>Bob Crowley's cunning cut-out design presents the perfect ironic background, in which cute white houses and a pop-up flagpole nestle among a range of breast-like hills. He creates a glitzy neon diner, and a tipsy clapboard church which collapses to spectacular effect. </p> <p>Things are set for a sophisticated satirical evening. But, for all its spookiness, The Witches of Eastwick is as conventional as any completely traditional musical, the most wholesome of which harbour dark corners. It comes close to suggesting that all a dissatisfied woman needs is a good seeing to by a man; a final, saccharine chorus about finding the answers inside yourself adds insult to injury. </p> <p>Rowe's music is prancing, punching, engaging: it whizzes everything along with deflating gurgles of brass, but it never sounds witchy, and always has a familiar, out-of- Chicago ring. Ian McShane is miscast as the diabolic sexpot. His singing is drab; his dancing is limp: he looks as if he had a headache even before he started on these women. </p> <p>Desmond Barrit's Falstaff is, as he should be, the great bellows of Henry IV, Part II, which opened last month in the Swan, stirringly directed by Michael Attenborough. Barrit never makes you think he's nice: he plays Falstaff's moments of shabby betrayal unstintingly, without any attempt at charm. But the easy roll of his gestures and phrases marks him as the source of warmth in this abundant, melancholy play, which shifts so swiftly from the public to the intimate. He makes other characters look as if they're trying too hard. And when the ratter is ratted on, it feels not like justice but treachery. Es Devlin's cinder-coloured design, in which gold lines gleam through the grey ashes, reinforces this. When the new king appears like a picture-book monarch in stiff white robes, the sky behind him turns rosy. When he spurns his old companion, it fades to grey. </p> <p>The King, David Troughton, speaking more smoothly than he did in Part I, is compelling as a man whose power is seeping away. When he takes off the crown, you feel the strain in his hands and head, as if he were removing something soldered to his scalp. William Houston's Hal, moving from nervousness to resolution, looks set to be a fascinating Henry V. Particularly now, perhaps: Prince Charles is said to have spoken admiringly of Shakespeare's understanding of what it is to be a monarch in waiting. </p> <p>The most enchanting passage is provided by Benjamin Whitrow and Peter Copley as Shallow and Silence, mulling over old times and old England.

Directed by Chen Kaige; starring Gong Li, Zhang Fengyi, Li Xuejian </p> <p><strong> Kadosh </strong> (110 mins, 15) Directed by Amos Gita\u00ef; starring Ya\u00ebl Abecassis, Yoram Hattab, Meital Barda, Uri Ran-Klauzner </p> <p><strong> Stuart Little </strong> (84 mins, PG) Directed by Rob Minkoff; starring Geena Davis, Hugh Laurie, Jonathan Lipnicki </p> <p><strong> Fortress 2 </strong> (99 mins, 18) Directed by Geoff Murphy; starring Christopher Lambert, Patrick Malahide, Pam Grier </p> <p><strong> Shaft </strong> (100 mins, 15) Directed by Gordon Parks; starring Richard Roundtree, Moses Gunn, Charles Cioffi </p> <p>Writing from Cannes last year I gave rather short shrift to Chen Kaige's The Emperor and the Assassin, after seeing it with French subtitles half-way through the Festival and at the end of a long day. I was wrong. It is certainly a little too long, but the ambition and achievement put most current films to shame. </p> <p>The movie, which compares favourably with Kurosawa's late epics, Kagemusha and Ran, is set in the third century BC when Ying Zheng, the King of Qin, became the first Emperor of China by unifying the seven large kingdoms that had been warring for centuries. His dynasty lasted a mere 15 years. As depicted in the film Ying Sheng's an honest man dedicated to bringing peace to his country. But he's a flawed ruler, warped by the humiliations of a period in exile and driven almost mad by the discovery that his mother has borne children to her lover, who's conspiring against him. He is driven over the edge by the revelation that his real father is not the late king but the Prime Minister (played by Chen Kaige himself) whom he's dismissed. He ends up a ruthless killer spreading death around him. </p> <p>The king's antithesis is Jing Ke, a ruthless assassin who has repented of his way of life to become a man of peace. Mediating between the two is Lady Zhao (the beautiful Gong Li), the king's childhood sweetheart. She first conspires with the king to fake an assassination attempt that will provide a pretext for him to invade yet another nation, choosing the reluctant, fearless Jing Ke for the job. Then as the King's actions become increasingly brutal, encouraging extreme violence among others, she decides to plan a genuine assassination. </p> <p>Visually the film, said to be the most expensive ever made by an Asian country, is stunning, with spectacular sieges and battles involving a cast of thousands, hundreds of them on horseback. The defeat of a coup, in which the insurgents are surrounded in the middle of a vast courtyard by four groups of black-clad archers and swordsmen carrying golden shields, is memorably staged. Maps figure emblematically throughout the film - the floor of the imperial map room is just big enough to contain a map of the seven kingdoms to be united; the assassin plans to conceal his sword inside a rolled-up map that supposedly represents a tract of land that is to be ceded to the king. And all this is at the service of a story that has elements of classic tragedy, is psychologically subtle, and constantly suggests modern parallels. </p> <p>A similar seriousness informs Amos Gita\u00ef's Kadosh (Hebrew for sacred), which was also shown in competition at Cannes last year. Directed by Israel's leading film-maker and co-scripted by a Frenchwoman, Eliette Abecassis, this is the third part of his trilogy of movies set in different cities, though the earlier Haifa and Tel Aviv pictures have yet to be shown here and I've seen neither. </p> <p> Kadosh takes place in the Mea Shearim area of Jerusalem, centre of ultra-orthodoxy, and the picture begins with a seven-minute single shot of the elaborate rituals - prayers, washing, dressing - that Meir, a young Talmudic scholar, goes through on waking in the morning as his wife lies asleep. To a non-Jewish agnostic, it looks quaint, touching, more than a little mad. </p> <p>This is not, however, sentimental Fiddler on the Roof stuff. Meir's handsome, devoted wife, Rivka, has not borne him children after 10 years of marriage, though most likely this is the result of his sterility. Rivka suffers in silence, unlike her younger sister, Malka, who wants to marry a singer and quit the community. The pressure of patriarchy, Talmudic prescriptions and unquestioned traditions, results in Malka being forced into marriage with an insensitive young scholar, and the rabbi deciding that Meir (who's his son) should divorce Rivka and marry another woman. </p> <p>This is a story that makes the blood boil, but Gita\u00ef treats it in an objective fashion, never suggesting that these people are acting in any consciously vindictive or malevolent fashion. Seeing Kadosh the same day as I read reports of the Taliban religious police arresting a Pakistani football team for playing in shorts (and shaving their heads as punishment) brought home to me with a terrible force both the tragic and farcical aspects of fundamentalism. </p> <p>In a letter written in 1939 to the curator for children's books at New York Public Library, E.B. White, one of the great prose stylists of the twentieth century, remarked: 'My fears about writing for children are great - one can so easily slip into a cheap sort of whimsy or cuteness.' He was talking about Stuart Little, his story of a three-inch mouse living with a middle-class family in New York, and the pitfalls he refers to have not entirely been avoided by the people who've filmed it - a strong team that includes Rob Minkoff (director of The Lion King, screenwriter M. Night Shyamalan (author of The Sixth Sense) and John Dykstra (who won a Visual Effects Oscar for Star Wars). </p> <p>The film is a neater, less mysterious, more mundane affair than White's book, but it's a lot of fun. The setting is a fairy-tale Manhattan, the digitalised animals carry absolute conviction, and there's a lovely children's boat-race in Central Park with Stuart competing against electronically controlled yachts. Alternately a sentimental celebration of family life and a quite savage comedy, it swings in the early part between a scariness that recalls The Incredible Shrinking Man (Stuart drowning in a washing machine) and a live-action Tom and Jerry cartoon (Stuart chased by Snowbell, the family cat). </p> <p>The cats (voiced by Chazz Palminteri, Nathan Lane and Steve Zahn) have most of the best lines, for example when a desperate Stuart beseeches Snowbell to turn off the washing machine, the cat says: 'Why would I switch it off? It's my favourite show.' As Stuart's conventional adoptive father, Hugh Laurie - bespectacled, his hair cut short and sporting an American accent - bears an uncanny resemblance to Robert MacNamara. </p> <p>Fortress 2 is about as welcome as Ishtar 2 or Rancid Aluminium 2 would be. Made on location in Luxembourg, it's an incoherent sequel to the lousy 1994 sci-fi thriller Fortress with Christopher Lambert once again a rebel imprisoned in a hi-tech prison run by the Men-Tel Corporation in an authoritarian future. The chief difference is that in the earlier film the jail was underground and this one's in Outer Space. The director is the once-promising New Zealander Geoff Murphy, who has given little guidance to Patrick Malahide and Pam Grier as the competing jailers. </p> <p>The term 'blaxploitation' was coined in the early Seventies to describe the cycle of violent, sexy, ass-kicking movies launched by Shaft.

      "body": "<p>My friend and I have known each other for five years. I know her parents well and chat to them when I call round or phone. A week ago, early in the morning, I passed her father in the street. He was holding hands with a woman who was not my friend's mother. We walked past each other but I looked down. I have seen him since at her house and he is wary of me, obviously wondering if I am going to say something. Should I tell my friend or should I keep out of their business? <br><b>Y.L. of Beckenham, Kent</b></p> <p>It's difficult to think of an innocent explanation for your observations, but let's be generous and try. Truth is often improbably defiant. This could be a case of mistaken identity; many people have alter egos who resemble them so uncannily that even acquaintances can make an error in a casual, brief encounter. This man could have a brother, even an identical twin. Are you absolutely certain, meeting him in the half-light, half-awake in the early morning, embarrassed and hanging your head down, that it really was him and not someone else?</p> <p>I suspect that you are not certain, so let me do a little more speculating. Like the majority of humankind, you probably enjoy a little gossip, a chance to see behind the screens of respectable veneer and view some secret, sordid goings-on. We all indulge in this and wouldn't life be boring with out it? Hasn't the very thought given you a frisson? And - oh dear - can you admit that you'd be disappointed if some non-guilty explanation were to be produced? It's important to recognise this subconscious wish for the seamy construction to be the true one, because you have by your observations the power to cause a lot of misery and destruction.</p> <p>Indeed the very possession of this power can go to someone's head, to the extent that they cannot bear to have it and not to use it. So beware.</p> <p>What, then, if you really did catch your girlfriend's father in a mildly compromising situation? You assume that he has spent the night with this woman who is not his wife and one is walking the other home. Presumably his wife is aware that he is away from the house. He is adopting very risky behaviour if he prome nades openly near his neighbourhood in this friendly-if-not-quite-intimate way with his lady-friend. Some couples do have an open, free-and-easy attitude to infidelities, so it is quite possible they have such an understanding. Maybe they are remaining together only until the family are grown up and away. Maybe he's an ageing Lothario, a bit of an exhibitionist, who doesn't mind showing the younger generation that he too can be a bit of a lad.</p> <p>However you come at this, it seems there are very good reasons for keeping your mouth shut. If you reveal all, and are mistaken, you'll enhance yourself in nobody's eyes. If it's an open secret, you'll appear spiteful and small-minded, an interfering busybody. If you uncover a scandal, you'll be viewed as the harbinger of retribution, and much good it will definitely not do you - or anyone else.</p> <p>I think you may be young and inexperienced in the ways of the world. All is never what it seems, including the motivation for interfering in someone else's business. Wisdom is knowing when to leave well alone and say nothing; for you that starts here.</p> <p><b>Readers' replies</b></p> <p>Please do not interfere over what may well be a perfectly innocent action by your friend's father - you could arouse suspicions and doubts which could destroy the family. Instead of jumping to what you see as the obvious conclusion that you have witnessed an infidelity, consider other possibilities. I am recently widowed and find, in common with many other widows of my acquaintance, that most of all, I miss a strong arm to give me a friendly hug or a sympathetic touch of the hand.</p> <p>An understanding - married - male friend will hold my hand or give me a reassuring hug when he sees me looking particularly lost and alone.

      "bodyText": "My friend and I have known each other for five years. I know her parents well and chat to them when I call round or phone. A week ago, early in the morning, I passed her father in the street. He was holding hands with a woman who was not my friend's mother. We walked past each other but I looked down. I have seen him since at her house and he is wary of me, obviously wondering if I am going to say something. Should I tell my friend or should I keep out of their business? Y.L. of Beckenham, Kent It's difficult to think of an innocent explanation for your observations, but let's be generous and try. Truth is often improbably defiant. This could be a case of mistaken identity; many people have alter egos who resemble them so uncannily that even acquaintances can make an error in a casual, brief encounter. This man could have a brother, even an identical twin. Are you absolutely certain, meeting him in the half-light, half-awake in the early morning, embarrassed and hanging your head down, that it really was him and not someone else? I suspect that you are not certain, so let me do a little more speculating. Like the majority of humankind, you probably enjoy a little gossip, a chance to see behind the screens of respectable veneer and view some secret, sordid goings-on. We all indulge in this and wouldn't life be boring with out it? Hasn't the very thought given you a frisson? And - oh dear - can you admit that you'd be disappointed if some non-guilty explanation were to be produced? It's important to recognise this subconscious wish for the seamy construction to be the true one, because you have by your observations the power to cause a lot of misery and destruction. Indeed the very possession of this power can go to someone's head, to the extent that they cannot bear to have it and not to use it. So beware. What, then, if you really did catch your girlfriend's father in a mildly compromising situation? You assume that he has spent the night with this woman who is not his wife and one is walking the other home. Presumably his wife is aware that he is away from the house. He is adopting very risky behaviour if he prome nades openly near his neighbourhood in this friendly-if-not-quite-intimate way with his lady-friend. Some couples do have an open, free-and-easy attitude to infidelities, so it is quite possible they have such an understanding. Maybe they are remaining together only until the family are grown up and away. Maybe he's an ageing Lothario, a bit of an exhibitionist, who doesn't mind showing the younger generation that he too can be a bit of a lad. However you come at this, it seems there are very good reasons for keeping your mouth shut. If you reveal all, and are mistaken, you'll enhance yourself in nobody's eyes. If it's an open secret, you'll appear spiteful and small-minded, an interfering busybody. If you uncover a scandal, you'll be viewed as the harbinger of retribution, and much good it will definitely not do you - or anyone else. I think you may be young and inexperienced in the ways of the world. All is never what it seems, including the motivation for interfering in someone else's business. Wisdom is knowing when to leave well alone and say nothing; for you that starts here. Readers' replies Please do not interfere over what may well be a perfectly innocent action by your friend's father - you could arouse suspicions and doubts which could destroy the family. Instead of jumping to what you see as the obvious conclusion that you have witnessed an infidelity, consider other possibilities. I am recently widowed and find, in common with many other widows of my acquaintance, that most of all, I miss a strong arm to give me a friendly hug or a sympathetic touch of the hand. An understanding - married - male friend will hold my hand or give me a reassuring hug when he sees me looking particularly lost and alone. It does not mean he plans to leap into my bed. D.E. of Dyfed Next week's dilemma I've been seeing my girlfriend for four months and at the beginning of the relationship I was happy and madly in love with her. However, things have progressed and as she has become obviously attached to me, my feelings for her have diminished. Although I still fancy her, I know that we do not have enough shared interest between us. Is it just the usual question of cold feet or should I trust my instincts and get out before it develops into something which could hurt both of us. E.M.

Danish actress Iben Hjejle plays his lawyer girlfriend, who has just left him. They are directed by an Englishman, Stephen Frears, whose last movie, The Hi-Lo Country , was an off-beat western. </p> <p>The script is by four Americans, one of them Cusack himself, who has also co-produced with a couple of Britons and a couple of Americans, while the cinematographer, Seamus McGarvey, comes from Ulster and the editor, Mick Audsley, from London. They all seem very much at home in slightly rundown areas of the Windy City, though the torrential rain that frequently matches the hero's depressed states suggests it might easily be renamed the Rainy City. </p> <p>Cusack has the rare ability to play characters who have a complex inner life and to suggest a sense of decency that rejects piety - his hitman in Grosse Point Blank , for instance, and the puppeteer in Being John Malkovich . His everyday neurotics are people with whom we can easily identify. </p> <p>Here, he dominates the film, taking us into Rob's mind. For much of the time, he speaks directly to camera, not just in set-pieces, but while engaged in conversations or talking on the phone or walking down the street. Pop music and films are his obsessive interests, his knowledge of them encyclopedic and, since puberty, he has been troubled by girls, whom he fears, desires and tries to understand. </p> <p>His tastes define him, and for Rob and the pair of geeky assistants in his shop - the aggressive, overweight Barry (Jack Black) and the shy, shaven-headed Dick (Todd Louiso) - the music and films they admire have become shibboleths to test everyone they meet. 'What matters is what you like,' says Rob, 'not what you are like.' </p> <p>As many of us do, Rob seeks to impose order on his life by drawing up lists. His most extravagant gesture is to rearrange his vast collection of LPs as a form of autobiography so that he has to think of the personal association a record has to locate it. When Laura leaves him, he rejects her from a list of 'top five most memorable split-ups'. This first takes him down memory lane to recall five of his ex-girlfriends, starting with his first intense kiss when he was 14. </p> <p>These flashbacks recall Annie Hall and there is a brief appearance by Bruce Springsteen in an imaginary conversation with Rob that brings to mind Woody Allen's encounter with Marshall McLuhan in that picture. </p> <p>When Rob later sets about looking up the old girlfriends, we think of Julien Duvivier's romantic classic of the Thirties, Un Carnet du Bal , where Marie Bell found nothing but misery when tracking down the swains of her young womanhood. </p> <p> High Fidelity is an extra ordinarily funny film, full of verbal and visual wit. And it is assembled with immense skill. There is a brilliant sequence when Rob reconstructs in his mind a conversation between Laura and their mutual friend, Liz (Joan Cusack), knowing that Laura must have touched on four key moments (those lists again) in their relationship. The film constantly cuts in mid-sentence between Rob talking to camera in a bar and the two women conversing over lunch, and a combination of astute direction, fine acting and spot-on editing gives it an easy, seamless quality. </p> <p>The picture never scores cheap points off anybody, which does not, of course, mean that the characters involved do not often obtain satisfaction, if only temporarily, by thinking they have won an argument or put someone in his or her place. When Rob is putting his past in order, he often employs a form of choplogic that briefly satisfies him. At the end, both he and we, the audience, are happily surprised by the way things turn out for him and his assistants, Barry and Dick. </p> <p>Catherine Zeta-Jones plays Charlie, the hollow sophisticate, memorable break-up number four, who helps Rob see the vanity of the world, and it is good to see her mixing with people her own age.</p>",

She may have been an older woman's walking, talking nightmare, and she may have filled lesser males with an insatiable longing and a keen understanding of the limits of their buying power. But at home she was often skittish, expensive, and boring.</p> <p>The older trophy, by contrast, can really be 'there for you'. She will not yawn when you talk shop in bed because that's all she wants to talk about anyway. And when you are too tired to go out dancing, she would never think of pouting or kicking up a fuss, because she knows exactly how you feel.</p> <p>So you have to wonder why it took so long for her to come into her own. When I think back on all the trophy couples I've known, the defining trait of the men is a terrible loneliness. After the honeymoon is over, they feel their age keenly. They live their lives perched on a cliff, surveying an age gap that seems to get wider with every year. As their energy wanes and their young wives get restless, they talk about longing to be understood and appreciated. Most of all they long for a woman who will share their interests, make them feel safe and loved, bring their experience to bear on the problems that plague them, and illuminate all discussions with helpful suggestions and sparkling insights.</p> <p>I mean, who wouldn't? I wouldn't dream of suggesting that these are the only things a spoilt, rich, older man might long for. Hardly a day goes by without some well-meaning male friend waving a neo-Darwinian tract in my face, while explaining why it is that red-blooded men will always lust most after nubile young women. But even they occasionally concede that there are needs and needs, and that the right sort of older woman might make a better and more sympathetic companion.</p> <p>If I can get them to admit that older women have always had a lot to give to a relationship, they will usually go on to claim that men have often shied away from the joys of mature love in the past because they are afraid that if they do take an older, not quite decorative wife, their colleagues will laugh at them. However, if the older trophy wife goes from social oddity to unquestioned fixture, we could see the trend trickling down to the lower echelons, and the marriage prospects for all women over 40 could become much, much brighter.</p> <p>If that's what women want, that is. Me, I'm not convinced. When I look back on what's been said so far about the older trophy phenomenon, the first thing I notice is that most of the talk is about the pros and cons for the men. There's next to nothing about the women. What's in it for them?</p> <p>They have flash jobs already, so it's can't be reflected glory they're after. And they have bank accounts that are bursting at the seams, so they can't be desperate for the money. You have to hope that it's love that's made them take these men on. And you can only assume that they, too, find it lonely at the top. And long for someone who really understands what ails and inspires them and crave companionship. But they almost certainly go into their marriages expecting the caring and nurturing and pillow shop-talk to work both ways.</p> <p>And if you ask me, an overweening CEO who is used to being waited on by a full-time wife and an army of ardent secretaries, is the least likely candidate for this sort of twenty-first cen tury egalitarian give-and-take. His own importance might be enhanced by the important woman on his arm, but only if she goes along with the myth that she is not quite as important as he is.</p> <p>What a lot of these guys are after, I suspect, is a high tech, intellectual version of the wife who always knows when to bring them their slippers. This is a hard enough job if you have all the hours in the day. But why would any woman with her own business empire want to drag herself home in the evening to spend the next six hours reflecting her husband back at twice his size?</p> <p>If you ask me, the older trophy phenomenon does not look like progress. It looks like yet another frying pan leading on to yet another fire. It's probably just as well - when you count the number of lonely millionaires who have not been beating my door down lately with offers of marriage - but honestly, genteel poverty looks like heaven in comparison.</p> <p>So I'm sorry boys. I know I'm incredibly successful and just the right age. But you are going to have to count me out.</p>",

But why would any woman with her own business empire want to drag herself home in the evening to spend the next six hours reflecting her husband back at twice his size? If you ask me, the older trophy phenomenon does not look like progress. It looks like yet another frying pan leading on to yet another fire. It's probably just as well - when you count the number of lonely millionaires who have not been beating my door down lately with offers of marriage - but honestly, genteel poverty looks like heaven in comparison. So I'm sorry boys. I know I'm incredibly successful and just the right age. But you are going to have to count me out.",

      "body": "<p>In Budd Schulberg's classic fictional account of Hollywood, What Makes Sammy Run? first published in 1941, the hero, Sammy Glick graduates from a local newspaper in New York and moves out West as a screenwriter. 'No more peanuts for me,' he declares to his newsroom colleagues. 'From now on, it's 250 bucks a week, starting a week from Wednesday.' </p> <p>Glick is eventually ruined by Hollywood. 'All the glory and the opportunity, the push and the speed, the grinding of gears and the crap.' Almost 60 years on, Schulberg's bleak vision of the movie industry is still a powerful metaphor for the acting profession around the world. </p> <p>If anything, the situation for actors in particular is even worse. In Britain, over 90 per cent of them are unemployed at any given time. Yet while the number of graduates pouring out of drama and stage schools continues to rise, the opportunities are dwindling. And finding out about openings is harder than ever if you're not already one of the lucky 10 per cent. </p> <p>But it's not all bad news. 'Resting' actors are about to be offered a new networking opportunity and they won't have to be a member of Soho House to use it. It will be available on the internet. Launched in September, sofamouse.com will allow would-be stars to post their CVs online and live video feeds will register British acting talent directly to American producers. And perhaps, more crucially, sofamouse.com will advertise non-skilled jobs for resting professionals. </p> <p>'Actors rarely hear about work being offered; to an extent getting work still depends on who you know. The film community is still very difficult to break into,' says Oliver Montgomery, an actor himself and one of the site's founders. He estimates that there are just under one million people in Britain looking for work in and around the acting industry. 'Hopefully, we'll register around 100,000 of them by the end of the year,' he says. 'We'd like to think that we could make a big enough impact to get a lot of employers regularly advertising jobs on our site. </p> <p>'It's a hard thing for actors to admit to themselves - that they might have to look for other work when the parts don't come in,' he adds. 'Meanwhile there are employers out there who are looking for gregarious people to host corporate parties and work with children. It's a sad reality of the profession that's quite hard for most thespians to admit to.' </p> <p>Montgomery's entrepreneurship may offer hope to out-of-work actors but in reality it's unlikely to make a huge difference. There are already numerous acting industry websites. The best way for an actor to get work is to be in a job already. Successful actors are the new aristocracy. </p> <p>Top British casting agent Joyce Nettles, who is featured in a candid four-part Channel 4 documentary Starstruck, thinks we have too many actors. Having worked on films such as Lars von Trier's Breaking The Waves and his upcoming Dancer In The Dark, Nettles is a veteran agent with vast knowledge of British acting history. In the first episode she holds up the first published edition of the Actor's Directory, which is an industry manual for producers and agents. The slimline book, now 30 years old and barely 60 pages long, has been replaced by Spotlight 's eight volumes: each as thick as the London telephone directory. </p> <p>Nettles argues the profession has been cheapened by inadequately trained actors and fame-seekers. 'I was trying to make a point,' says Nettles. 'That perhaps there are too many actors. Does that mean there is more choice? It's like walking into a supermarket and seeing 50 different kinds of crisps. Do we need them all? What's wrong with just having the basic choices? With all these actors looking for work, it's apparent that not all of them are going to be successful. Let's face it, most directors would still rather cast a soap star. Or someone who has been in a film before. No one is prepared to take a chance with fresh faces anymore.' </p> <p>The statistics speak for themselves: over 90 per cent of actors earn less than \u00a312,000 a year. Regular work is a rarity for most of those without proven names. Stars who come armed with track records and fit certain stereotypes get lucrative parts. Says Nettles: 'You can't fund projects these days with actors just starting out. Even independent cinema now demands stars willing to take a cut in pay. Even in Britain, bankability is the current obsession.' </p> <p> Hollyoaks ' executive-producer, Phil Redmond, disagrees. 'I don't think there are any more people trying to break into acting,' he says. Last March Redmond held a series of nationwide auditions for four parts in Hollyoaks and 40,000 potential candidates flocked to casting sessions in London, Edinburgh, Chester, Cardiff and Belfast. 'I remember interviewing people back in the days of Grange Hill and we'd have just as many candidates. I just think the acting profession is better organised now, so perhaps the jobs are snapped up more quickly. And let's face it, there is less work for actors unless you're a name.' </p> <p>However grim the twenty-first century may look for actors, the sofamouse website should probably gear up for hundreds of thousands of hits. As Starstruck shows would-be actors are prepared to put themselves through all manner of degradations to gain that elusive first break. Renee Simone, aged 18, is a Hollywood hopeful who is featured in episode one. In an effort to mould her into the conventional film beauty, her manager has already forced her to lose 55 pounds and ordered an entire makeover. Simone, almost always on the brink of tears, has yet to win an audition. </p> <p>'Right now, she's more of a character actress, unfortunately,' says her manager Carolyn Divine coolly. 'She's not the little hot cheerleader girl that the guys are all after. And when you hear that enough, you think, \"Right, we have to do something about this\" '. The programme shows Divine sending Simone out for a variety of alternative roles which she describes as 'freaks and geeks'. Simone finally breaks down in tears. 'I just want this so bad,' she cries. She never gets it. Divine dumps her. </p> <p>'I think the once noble profession has undergone a radical change in the last decade,' says Emma Hewitt, series director of Starstruck and once an actor herself. 'People now are more concerned with being stars and being famous. And that entails being famous for anything. So with a profession that suddenly stops revolving around artis tic merits and concentrates on chasing the limelight - what kind of people are you going to attract? And acting does attract a certain kind of brutality: the criticism is often overwhelming. Does that mean the profession has been cheapened? I guess it does.' </p> <p>Hewitt says she used the series to articulate her own experiences of the acting trade. It makes for troubling viewing. 'These people are disturbed,' she says. 'After all, what kind of person does it take to get on screen? It's about more than just attention-seeking. These people genuinely feel they have a gift to share with cinema-lovers. Imagine their disappointment when they're not given the chance.' </p> <p>Fay Ripley, who is starring in the third series of Cold Feet, takes a less elevated view of her trade than Emma Hewitt. 'I don't think acting ever was a noble profession,' she says. </p> <p>'It's a profession obsessed by how you look,' argues Ripley, soon to appear with David Baddiel in a British film The Announcement . 'I'm not thin enough, and have had people tell me that. British producers and agents can be quite brutal about how they perceive you: once you're linked to a certain type of role, then that's pretty much it for most of your career. In fact, in one case, I was even asked if I could pin back my ears for a part.' </p> <p>Other revealing interviews in Starstruck are with performers such as Richard Dreyfuss, Mel Gibson, Amanda Donohue, Mickey Rourke, Tracy Shaw, Rufus Sewell and Burt Reynolds. They show how little things have changed since Schulberg wrote about Hollywood 60 years ago. Says Dreyfuss: 'You come out the other side, completely changed as a human being. I think I was happiest when I was chasing my ambitions at the age of 20. I certainly wasn't happy when I achieved them. That's the price you pay for it. It took me years to adjust to that.' </p> <p>Renee Simone please take note. </p> <p>\u0095 Starstruck starts on 16 August on Channel 4</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It's the Sodom and Gomorrah of activity holidays! The Xanadu of unrestraint! The Mecca of being sick in public! Try saying 'Ibiza' without summoning images from the throbbing black heart of this summer-long Eden of rave, whose growing apocrypha tells of nightclubs packed to the rafters with naked, writhing voluptuaries, tattooed and tongue-pierced, stuffing their faces with ecstasy and shagging doggy-fashion on the dance floor in scenes of debauched Bacchanalian excess reminiscent of Caligula's Rome and those off-season weekends in Butlins that used to be so popular with off-duty estate agents. </p> <p>Gleeful TV bonkumentaries such as Ibiza Uncovered and The Dog's Balearics nightly recount for us the adventures of intoxicated young Brits being up at all hours, taking their shirts off and urinating in the bougainvillea. So widespread is the island's infamy that even dedicated avoiders of Europop have heard and been irritated by that song 'Whoaaah, I'm Going to Ibiza'. </p> <p>And now, if more discarded underwear were needed to be thrown on this bonfire of inanities, an astonishing study from the Liverpool John Moores University has revealed that people between the ages of 19 and 21 are more likely to drink lager, take drugs and have more than one sexual partner in Ibiza than back home in Rhyl or Huddersfield, where they've got their mums shouting at them to get up for work. </p> <p>And so it is that I set out in the spirit of open-minded journalistic inquiry to this El Dorado of unspeakable filth to answer the one question ringing in my ears - 'Can any package destination really be this much fun?' - and in the process perhaps stay there for the rest of my life, leaving my wife and children in penury. </p> <p>So where better to start than the MTV Ibiza 2000 live dance music festival, an all-night binge of the senses whose inaugural blast last year attracted 12,000 hardened ravers, their minds crackling with pharmaceuticals, locked as one to the beat, impervious to the call of bedtime, drawn helplessly to wearing those trousers that unzip at the knee and don't need ironing. </p> <p>I'm patrolling the vast crater of a disused stone quarry outside San Antonio, watching as these saucer-eyed hipsters of hedonism come streaming in between two giant, yellow, inflatable beer bottles, descending into the dustbowl arena, crowding the two stages. The sun is on its way down, turning the hills pink; a digitised, pulsing din strafes the air (tooosh toooosh toooosh); the lighting man sends lava-lamp patterns splatting against the towering sandy crag behind us. It's very atmospheric, though a bit on the noisy side. </p> <p>Apparently, every world-famous DJ no one normal has never heard of is on the bill tonight. DJs are the new rock stars, though you wouldn't know it. Our current one is sitting up there looking like a bus driver waiting for the lights to change. But they are geniuses of a sort, apparently. It is an art. A girl, noticing my notebook, drifts into my orbit wearing underwear and feathers, so I ask her what's so special about DJs. She's not sure. Some DJs can play two records at the same time, she says. </p> <p>'Ha-ha, it sounds like it too,' I joke, not joking at all, of course. </p> <p>The crowd is warming up but no one looks remotely prepared to take their clothes off in a spontaneous frenzy, despite the flitting presence of Karen, The Observer 's photographer. We go to the bar. Clearly, the key to having a good time here is in trying not to recoil physically from the music if you can possibly help it. I do blame myself for letting rave culture pass me by to the extent that I am quite unable to grasp the complex aesthetic criteria whereby 'dance music' was able to qualify at some point in history as 'music'. It seems that the evolution from hip-hop to trip-hop to dip-dop was over before I had a chance to appreciate the fine distinction between one subgenre of endless repetition and another. </p> <p>Still, the beer is cold, the evening is young. Plenty of time yet to have my drink spiked with mind-altering drugs and, who knows, perhaps contract a sexually transmitted disease. Meanwhile, Karen is trying to get me to dance for the camera. No way. </p> <p>The Artful Dodger comes on stage with Craig David. I'm not sure which one is singing what, but someone at the bar tells me this is UK garage crossover disposable two-step with R&amp;B vocals. 'Thanks,' I say, scribbling 'tuneless' in my notebook, before moving down to the other stage where the DJ is hiding (with good reason) behind his decks playing a speeded-up recording of someone sawing a plank of wood. It's funny everybody looking at a stage with nothing happening on it, though the lighting man is doing a grand job with whirling sunflowers and little beams darting around in the smoke desperately searching for points of interest. </p> <p>A young woman in sequinned hotpants strides past with flashing red devil's horns on her head. I make a mental note to take a pair home (horns, that is, not hotpants or young women). </p> <p>'Are you feeling READY... ' the DJ is yelling. </p> <p>'Are you KIDDING?' I feel like yelling back. </p> <p>But this is before I discover the chill-out zone, which is located in its own little, self-contained canyon. There's a bearded percussionist in a turban and a sax player and Christmas baubles hanging up and fairy lights (don't ask me). It's pretty funky. It has a very gentle 'vibe' (as I keep hearing people say with no sense of embarrassment). Goateed youngsters are lying about the slopes, understandably entranced, and it occurs to me that many of them may never have seen a proper musical instrument before. I tap my foot rhythmically for a good 15 minutes before returning to the main arena and drinking a further 12 pints of beer. </p> <p> Tooosh toooosh toooosh... I decide it's time I visited a nightclub, if only to find a toilet that has a light inside and some semblance of hygiene. It takes me a while to locate Karen, who is busy trying to get a shot of a reveller's thrusting pelvis, and we get a cab to Pacha, a club at the other side of the island, where London's Ministry of Sound do a Friday night residency. </p> <p>Hang on, I'm wondering... isn't this the place with the live sex show where everyone slithers about in shaving foam? No, it is not. This one is quite classy in a glittery, ostentatious way. It's still got the exploding music that punches your eardrums out the minute you get through the door, but the dancing is relatively restrained, with many yachty-looking punters happy to shuffle around without quite leaving the bar (four quid for a bottle of Becks). </p> <p>Yes, there's a couple hired to undulate energetically at either end of a small stage, and a seven-foot-tall transvestite catwoman stalking about in so much designer Bacofoil you can see your face in her, but it's a knowingly cool gathering. I plunge into the crowd on the dancefloor to see if I succumb to inner seminal forces beyond my control, but the music is like standing next to a helicopter, and it's not long before I am blown headlong back into the periphery by a gale of decibels. </p> <p>A young man sidles up and asks if I've got any pills. Blimey! </p> <p>'Sorry,' I say. 'But put me down for an Anadin if you find some.' </p> <p>The club won't let Karen take pictures, though God knows they haven't got that much to hide. So off we go. At the entrance they're selling T-shirts with the message 'Fuck the tan' - quite subtle by local standards of T-shirt humour, which I have noticed generally runs along the lines of 'Viagra is for pussies' or 'Masturbation is no crime'. </p> <p>It's about 4.30am when we arrive back at the festival, which from the road sounds like what dustbin-making factories must have sounded like before the Noise Abatement Act. Back inside, the crater has reached an infernal level of tumult. We have missed Underworld, which I'm sure is a huge pity because apparently they are household names in some households, notably (according to the blurb) for their masterpiece Dubnobasswithmyheadman, which was the best album since Screamadelica. Damn. Still, never mind. </p> <p>'Are you with me, IBIZA?' the DJ is shouting. We are with him, it turns out. </p> <p>He puts a new record on (or possibly the same one) and the crowd go berserk, jigging up and down and fisting the air and sitting on each other's shoulders. I notice (now that I am safely drunk) how every 'mix' has these bleepy, sinewy passages that are used to build quietly before crashing without warning back into numbskull hammer mode, which as anyone who has ever thrown a stick for a dog will know, is a not very sophisticated way of getting an audience to beg, but what joy ensues! What release! What ecstasy! Well, I mean for everyone else. </p> <p>The moment that I might have taken part in the dancing - which, like any other abandonment of human dignity, is something I feel is best done in the privacy of your bedroom - has passed without incident. Perhaps tomorrow. </p> <p>A silver blonde passes in a skirt made out of silver medallions and silver boots that glow in the dark. Someone else is wearing a sieve on her head. But disappointingly, most of the crowd are no more visually arresting than me (T-shirt, unflattering shorts), though I suppose I am at least distinguishable by having my fingers stuck in my ears. </p> <p>Then, as if from nowhere, I spot my first pair of bare breasts. Yes! Admittedly, they do belong to someone on stilts and have been painted green to reduce the likelihood of unwelcome erotic attention, but even so they must surely still count as a sighting. My work is surely done for the day. </p> <p>The ground, I note, has become a layer of squashed plastic bottles which makes staggering extra difficult. I've also reached that point in the day where I am required to remember the name of my hotel. </p> <p>On the way out I see Boy George leaning against a car. It must be gone six. </p> <p>'Night, Boy George,' I shout. This is how bad things are. </p> <p>'Night,' he shouts back. </p> <p>TOOOSH TOOOOSH TOOOOOSH... Four hours later, I'm out of bed, thanks to the complimentary wake-up call coming from the poolside sound system under my hotel window, which this morning is broadcasting the usual beach-groove-megamix cacophony plus an organised laughing and bellowing contest for younger people. </p> <p>The bad news is I've missed breakfast. The good news is, I seem to be already dressed, so I put my sunglasses on and take my hangover for a walk along the parched strip of road outside in the baking heat. Union Jacks hang from the balconies, bar after bar offers snotty eggs and bacon, sausages, beans, Premiership football, karaoke, curry, fish and chips and live music with Martin and Phil every night. </p> <p>I find a Spar and buy a loaf of bread, a nectarine, a Diet Coke and, as an afterthought, some deodorant that I should have bought yesterday.

And I've kind of got a girlfriend at home.' He is kind enough to make me not feel too much like a perverted uncle for asking. Four girls come rushing out of Kentucky Fried Chicken screaming and squirting water pistols at boys they fancy. Every time Karen raises her camera, she is surrounded by gurners and snoggers.

      "bodyText": "It's the Sodom and Gomorrah of activity holidays! The Xanadu of unrestraint! The Mecca of being sick in public! Try saying 'Ibiza' without summoning images from the throbbing black heart of this summer-long Eden of rave, whose growing apocrypha tells of nightclubs packed to the rafters with naked, writhing voluptuaries, tattooed and tongue-pierced, stuffing their faces with ecstasy and shagging doggy-fashion on the dance floor in scenes of debauched Bacchanalian excess reminiscent of Caligula's Rome and those off-season weekends in Butlins that used to be so popular with off-duty estate agents. Gleeful TV bonkumentaries such as Ibiza Uncovered and The Dog's Balearics nightly recount for us the adventures of intoxicated young Brits being up at all hours, taking their shirts off and urinating in the bougainvillea. So widespread is the island's infamy that even dedicated avoiders of Europop have heard and been irritated by that song 'Whoaaah, I'm Going to Ibiza'. And now, if more discarded underwear were needed to be thrown on this bonfire of inanities, an astonishing study from the Liverpool John Moores University has revealed that people between the ages of 19 and 21 are more likely to drink lager, take drugs and have more than one sexual partner in Ibiza than back home in Rhyl or Huddersfield, where they've got their mums shouting at them to get up for work. And so it is that I set out in the spirit of open-minded journalistic inquiry to this El Dorado of unspeakable filth to answer the one question ringing in my ears - 'Can any package destination really be this much fun?' - and in the process perhaps stay there for the rest of my life, leaving my wife and children in penury. So where better to start than the MTV Ibiza 2000 live dance music festival, an all-night binge of the senses whose inaugural blast last year attracted 12,000 hardened ravers, their minds crackling with pharmaceuticals, locked as one to the beat, impervious to the call of bedtime, drawn helplessly to wearing those trousers that unzip at the knee and don't need ironing. I'm patrolling the vast crater of a disused stone quarry outside San Antonio, watching as these saucer-eyed hipsters of hedonism come streaming in between two giant, yellow, inflatable beer bottles, descending into the dustbowl arena, crowding the two stages. The sun is on its way down, turning the hills pink; a digitised, pulsing din strafes the air (tooosh toooosh toooosh); the lighting man sends lava-lamp patterns splatting against the towering sandy crag behind us. It's very atmospheric, though a bit on the noisy side. Apparently, every world-famous DJ no one normal has never heard of is on the bill tonight. DJs are the new rock stars, though you wouldn't know it. Our current one is sitting up there looking like a bus driver waiting for the lights to change. But they are geniuses of a sort, apparently. It is an art. A girl, noticing my notebook, drifts into my orbit wearing underwear and feathers, so I ask her what's so special about DJs. She's not sure. Some DJs can play two records at the same time, she says. 'Ha-ha, it sounds like it too,' I joke, not joking at all, of course. The crowd is warming up but no one looks remotely prepared to take their clothes off in a spontaneous frenzy, despite the flitting presence of Karen, The Observer 's photographer. We go to the bar. Clearly, the key to having a good time here is in trying not to recoil physically from the music if you can possibly help it. I do blame myself for letting rave culture pass me by to the extent that I am quite unable to grasp the complex aesthetic criteria whereby 'dance music' was able to qualify at some point in history as 'music'. It seems that the evolution from hip-hop to trip-hop to dip-dop was over before I had a chance to appreciate the fine distinction between one subgenre of endless repetition and another. Still, the beer is cold, the evening is young. Plenty of time yet to have my drink spiked with mind-altering drugs and, who knows, perhaps contract a sexually transmitted disease. Meanwhile, Karen is trying to get me to dance for the camera. No way. The Artful Dodger comes on stage with Craig David. I'm not sure which one is singing what, but someone at the bar tells me this is UK garage crossover disposable two-step with R&amp;B vocals. 'Thanks,' I say, scribbling 'tuneless' in my notebook, before moving down to the other stage where the DJ is hiding (with good reason) behind his decks playing a speeded-up recording of someone sawing a plank of wood. It's funny everybody looking at a stage with nothing happening on it, though the lighting man is doing a grand job with whirling sunflowers and little beams darting around in the smoke desperately searching for points of interest. A young woman in sequinned hotpants strides past with flashing red devil's horns on her head. I make a mental note to take a pair home (horns, that is, not hotpants or young women). 'Are you feeling READY... ' the DJ is yelling. 'Are you KIDDING?' I feel like yelling back. But this is before I discover the chill-out zone, which is located in its own little, self-contained canyon. There's a bearded percussionist in a turban and a sax player and Christmas baubles hanging up and fairy lights (don't ask me). It's pretty funky. It has a very gentle 'vibe' (as I keep hearing people say with no sense of embarrassment). Goateed youngsters are lying about the slopes, understandably entranced, and it occurs to me that many of them may never have seen a proper musical instrument before. I tap my foot rhythmically for a good 15 minutes before returning to the main arena and drinking a further 12 pints of beer. Tooosh toooosh toooosh... I decide it's time I visited a nightclub, if only to find a toilet that has a light inside and some semblance of hygiene. It takes me a while to locate Karen, who is busy trying to get a shot of a reveller's thrusting pelvis, and we get a cab to Pacha, a club at the other side of the island, where London's Ministry of Sound do a Friday night residency. Hang on, I'm wondering... isn't this the place with the live sex show where everyone slithers about in shaving foam? No, it is not. This one is quite classy in a glittery, ostentatious way. It's still got the exploding music that punches your eardrums out the minute you get through the door, but the dancing is relatively restrained, with many yachty-looking punters happy to shuffle around without quite leaving the bar (four quid for a bottle of Becks). Yes, there's a couple hired to undulate energetically at either end of a small stage, and a seven-foot-tall transvestite catwoman stalking about in so much designer Bacofoil you can see your face in her, but it's a knowingly cool gathering. I plunge into the crowd on the dancefloor to see if I succumb to inner seminal forces beyond my control, but the music is like standing next to a helicopter, and it's not long before I am blown headlong back into the periphery by a gale of decibels. A young man sidles up and asks if I've got any pills. Blimey! 'Sorry,' I say. 'But put me down for an Anadin if you find some.' The club won't let Karen take pictures, though God knows they haven't got that much to hide. So off we go. At the entrance they're selling T-shirts with the message 'Fuck the tan' - quite subtle by local standards of T-shirt humour, which I have noticed generally runs along the lines of 'Viagra is for pussies' or 'Masturbation is no crime'. It's about 4.30am when we arrive back at the festival, which from the road sounds like what dustbin-making factories must have sounded like before the Noise Abatement Act. Back inside, the crater has reached an infernal level of tumult. We have missed Underworld, which I'm sure is a huge pity because apparently they are household names in some households, notably (according to the blurb) for their masterpiece Dubnobasswithmyheadman, which was the best album since Screamadelica. Damn. Still, never mind. 'Are you with me, IBIZA?' the DJ is shouting. We are with him, it turns out. He puts a new record on (or possibly the same one) and the crowd go berserk, jigging up and down and fisting the air and sitting on each other's shoulders. I notice (now that I am safely drunk) how every 'mix' has these bleepy, sinewy passages that are used to build quietly before crashing without warning back into numbskull hammer mode, which as anyone who has ever thrown a stick for a dog will know, is a not very sophisticated way of getting an audience to beg, but what joy ensues! What release! What ecstasy! Well, I mean for everyone else. The moment that I might have taken part in the dancing - which, like any other abandonment of human dignity, is something I feel is best done in the privacy of your bedroom - has passed without incident. Perhaps tomorrow. A silver blonde passes in a skirt made out of silver medallions and silver boots that glow in the dark. Someone else is wearing a sieve on her head. But disappointingly, most of the crowd are no more visually arresting than me (T-shirt, unflattering shorts), though I suppose I am at least distinguishable by having my fingers stuck in my ears. Then, as if from nowhere, I spot my first pair of bare breasts. Yes! Admittedly, they do belong to someone on stilts and have been painted green to reduce the likelihood of unwelcome erotic attention, but even so they must surely still count as a sighting. My work is surely done for the day. The ground, I note, has become a layer of squashed plastic bottles which makes staggering extra difficult. I've also reached that point in the day where I am required to remember the name of my hotel. On the way out I see Boy George leaning against a car. It must be gone six. 'Night, Boy George,' I shout. This is how bad things are. 'Night,' he shouts back. TOOOSH TOOOOSH TOOOOOSH... Four hours later, I'm out of bed, thanks to the complimentary wake-up call coming from the poolside sound system under my hotel window, which this morning is broadcasting the usual beach-groove-megamix cacophony plus an organised laughing and bellowing contest for younger people. The bad news is I've missed breakfast. The good news is, I seem to be already dressed, so I put my sunglasses on and take my hangover for a walk along the parched strip of road outside in the baking heat. Union Jacks hang from the balconies, bar after bar offers snotty eggs and bacon, sausages, beans, Premiership football, karaoke, curry, fish and chips and live music with Martin and Phil every night. I find a Spar and buy a loaf of bread, a nectarine, a Diet Coke and, as an afterthought, some deodorant that I should have bought yesterday. I take a surreptitious sniff at an armpit. I wonder if this is why no one has invited me to have casual sex with them yet. I walk back along the beach eating and watching a group of Spam-coloured British hooligans fry in the heat. I toy with the idea of stopping to ask whether they have taken part in any scenes of outstanding vulgarity during their stay, but I can't quite trust myself to find the right words. I go back to bed for the day. In the evening we're back bright-eyed and kicking up dust at the quarry for a night of pop music, which doesn't augur terribly well for bad behaviour but you never know. Geri Halliwell comes on wearing a wedding dress for no reason other than to have it ripped off by a quintet of muscular dancers. Mind you, she does look fantastic for a woman of however old she says she is, and her voice sounds too good to be true (though this turns out to be because she is miming) and if there isn't much of a crowd this evening, it will look great on MTV once they've edited the emptiness out. 'C\u00f3mo est\u00e1n?' shouts Geri, who is half-Spanish. 'Sorry?' replies the audience, who aren't. After much forced 'partying' at the hands of our DJs for the evening, headliners Five take to the stage for a masterclass of identikit boy-band choreography (those heads hung in shame, that backwalking shimmy, those Ali G hand signals, that baggy clomping about punching the air). 'Give me the chance to prove I'm real...' one of them mimes, his face contorted with emotion. I scan the audience expectantly. Still no one throwing up. I at last oblige Karen with some novelty dancing of my own, before the pair of us take off down the hill to San Antonio, famous for its marauding gangs of overweight louts and slappers competing to affront public decency, the girls in strappy shoes and boob tubes, boys in replica football shirts - Chelsea, Wolves, Rangers. We skirt the harbour with its boats bobbing and jumble of tawdry, strip-lit takeaways (half-pounders, pizza, chips, kebabs, curry, ice-cream - mussels for foreigners), then take a right up into the pedestrianised grid of streets heaving with raucous promenaders swaying in groups of 10 from one bar to the next, downing vodka and Carlsberg and free shots of pina colada. 'Drink as much as you like in an hour,' says one sign, as unnecessary a piece of advice as you could wish to see. A trio of crapulous youths come swinging out of the Highlander bar down through the crowds chanting their fool heads off. 'TWO-ONE, TWO-ONE...' 'Who was playing?' I ask. They look at me bewildered. No, no, they explain. One of them has just got a 2.1 in his finals at university. Damn. We move on up, against the tide. Another cluster of sunbaked laddos.

      "body": "<p>There's a long bank of flowers on the A29, on the edge of the field where Sarah Payne's body was found. They lie there in their ribbons and cellophane wrappers, some already fading in the July heat. And there are soft toys, too; hundreds of them among the flowers. Teddies and clowns, hedgehogs, vivid dinosaurs and Beanie babies with bright eyes; some are new, others old and squashed flat by another child's hugs. Someone has put candles there; there are a couple of childish tapestries spelling out Sarah's name in clumsy running stitch; a couple of small wooden crosses. </p> <p>It is a shrine. People make their way here as if they were on a pilgrimage. The road is jammed in either direction; an adjacent field has been made into a special car park. They leave messages. Some are written to the Payne family, expressing sorrow for their loss. Most are to Sarah herself, notes she'll never read like the toys she'll never hold. </p> <p>Few directly acknowledge her death - most talk to her as if she were still alive; they soften the monstrosity of the tale, and its savage ending. They tell her that they know the man will be caught and punished, though they say no punishment could ever, ever be enough. 'Sweet Dreams, Little Princess', they say 'Sleep Tight'. Or 'Sarah, here's a teddy to cuddle while you sleep'. They talk of the beautiful garden that she's in now, safe at last. </p> <p>They leave the prayers that we know from childhood: </p> <p> Now I lay me down to sleep, <br> I pray the Lord my soul to keep. <br> And if I die before I wake, <br> I pray the Lord my soul to take. </p> <p> Or the poems that never fail to touch our soft, unstructured yearnings: </p> <p> Do not stand at my grave and weep, <br> I am not there, I do not sleep. <br> I am a thousand winds that blow, <br> I am the diamond glints on snow. <br> Do not stand at my grave and cry. <br> I am not there. I did not die. </p> <p> There are dozens of messages that seem to be trying to cheer her up. One child writes: 'One day you and your mummy and daddy, your brothers and sister will be together again. That's something you can look forward to.' There's a card signed in wonky writing by children who sound as if they knew her and it's like one of those leaving cards everyone signs. 'I'll miss ya!' one child writes; another says: 'I'm sorry you're gone'; another: 'Don't worry, Sarah.' </p> <p>Well, she won't worry now. That's over. And if they speak to her in the present tense, they also speak to her in tones of great intimacy. Darling, they call her, sweetheart, treasure, little love. Her mother came here and laid her own bouquet, but almost all the messages read as if they had been laid there by her mother. For the people who arrive, bearing their offerings, behave as if they had known and loved Sarah Payne. They weep and hold on to each other for comfort. Strangers console each other, united by their common sorrow and their common, spitting hate ('may he rot in hell'). </p> <p>One woman, standing next to me, breaks down. 'I can't read any more,' she says, bending over in grief. Later, I see her being led away, held up by her husband. The scene is inevitably poignant, but also deeply disturbing in the way that the mass outpouring of grief at Diana's death was disturbing. </p> <p>In our secular age, when we have lost the formal consolations of ritual, we find new ways to express our fears and our griefs. Certain events become emblematic. Certain people become icons. Sarah Payne, eight years old, with a shining face and gaps in her teeth, is innocence destroyed. She is the lost child, sanctified by her dreadful death. She is every parent's worst dream. The A29 pilgrims have come here to mourn her, and because they imagine it happening to their child or grandchild. </p> <p>But the grief we feel as voyeuristic strangers is weirdly pleasurable, in a throbbing, melancholy way - like weeping our eyes out at a film. We want to be close to tragedy, while remaining far off. We want to experience it as if it is our tragedy too; our loss, when, of course, it isn't. Real bereavement is very different from this glut of salt tears. </p> <p>'A nation weeps,' reads one card. Yes, but why exactly does a nation weep over the death of this one little girl? Other children have been murdered this year, and we didn't hear much about them, certainly don't cry for them or remember them by their names. Partly, of course, it is because of the narrative grip that the Payne story has held on us over three weeks. If it had been scripted for a Hollywood tearjerker, it could hardly have been more consummately powerful. An eight-year-old is playing with her brothers and sister in a field on a summer's day, close to her granny's house - this scene is like a metaphor for innocence and carefree youth; think of ears of corn, poppies, floaty cotton dresses, young and happy voices carried by the wind. </p> <p>She falls over, hurts her knees, decides she wants to go home. That's the last we see of her. A white van is spied, driving past the place she would have been. For 17 days, the police search for her. With each day, the agony of the family increases. The media quickly respond to the public emotion, and ratchet it up. Every paper carries her picture: the wide smile, eager face. There are other pictures too - like the one of the mother, Sara, walking along a beach holding her other daughter clutched to her breast. It's an image of both absence (the little girl is not Sarah) and of presence. We have snatches of Sarah's character: how she's a chatterbox. How she's their little princess. The parents give press conferences, clinging to each other, but impressively strong and desperately hopeful - their hope becomes like a prayer. It's as if they believe strongly enough that she is alive, then she will be. She'll be alive because they love her so much and want her back so much. </p> <p>We all know how that feels - we've all imagined losing our children; we've all turned round and seen the space where the body should be, in a supermarket, on the street. That gulp of pure terror. It's a primitive, visceral terror lodged in the deep structure of the brain. </p> <p>For 17 days, Sarah is like a ghost in our world: alive and not alive; somewhere but invisible. She haunts us. Then her body is found, naked, in a field of long grass and tall flowers, rather like the field where she was lost. There's a report that, a few miles from here, some campers heard someone screaming in the night. Later, a single black shoe is found, in a hedge. The agony is being drawn out. We think of Sarah and we think of our own loved one. We imagine Sarah's last moments (the screams, the nakedness), and we superimpose images of our own children on her face. </p> <p>This is the stuff of nightmares and of fairytales. Hansel and Gretel, Red Riding Hood, Persephone: the witch in the hidden house, the wolf in the dark forest, the beautiful girl snatched down into an underworld. The child that is snatched from us. The child that is lost. The child that is calling out for us but we can't hear. The child that needs us, but we're not there. Intolerable. Thus the murder of Sarah Payne has become an instant human myth of innocence destroyed, and also of an unquenchable, never-ending bereavement that her family will feel. </p> <p>The clich\u00e9s of redemption (time heals, that kind of thing) won't do here. There's no getting over this one, only through it. I remember A.S. Byatt, whose son was killed in a car crash when he was 11, saying that it took her the span of his life over again to find life in any way bearable. She said that she knew he was dead and that wishing him back wouldn't work, so she used to pray that she would go mad, and in her madness think he was alive again. </p> <p>Jonathan Dollimore, in his fine book, Death, Desire and Loss in Western Culture, makes the point that only humans experience the death of children as unbearable. Animals habitually lose half their offspring, or more, and hardly notice. But even in times when parents could expect to see several of their children die, it has never been acceptable to us. There is no sadder poem in the English language than William Wordsworth's about his dead daughter, 'Surprised by Joy'. </p> <p>We are alienated from nature, at war with death. Sarah Payne's death brings it home to us that human life is tragic, even while the messages pinned on to the flowers dodge this truth by invoking God, the arms of Jesus, sleep, dreams, beautiful gardens and angels. </p> <p>The death of James Bulger caused the same level of horror and sorrow and emotional identification. I think that was not just because he was murdered by two small boys, but because he was caught on video. We could watch him leaving us, over and over again, on a loop: the toddler putting his trusting hand in the hand of the murderer, and being led away. The grainy image was like a home movie, except home movies always capture happy moments. And with the Bulger murder, as with Sarah Payne's murder, we are suddenly made to feel terrified about the safety of all children, as if no one is safe, innocence is in peril, and terrible men lurk in the long grass, watching, waiting. Strangers feel compelled to come up to you to tell you to keep an eye on your son or daughter: don't let them out of your sight for a minute, not round that supermarket aisle, into that hollow tree, over the brow of the hill. Don't leave them alone for a second, in case the bogeyman should get them. I've heard that some parents are now buying their toddlers reins, so they can literally keep a grip on them at all times. </p> <p>We should let go of those reins, allow our children to play in the cornfields. In this country, between five and seven children are murdered each year by strangers. Between 60 and 80 are murdered by their family. Thousands more are abused. Tens of thousands go missing; there is now a ghost town of runaways in our midst. It might be hard to dwell upon Sarah Payne's death, but it's hard in an easy, lazy, self-pleasing and self-deluding way for it feeds our willingness to think of the world as a Manichean place of good and bad, innocence and evil, bright day and pitch night. </p> <p>It is far easier to think about the stranger in a white van and wish him dead, than to think of the father, the stepfather, the family 'friend', the social worker, the priest; all the people like us. Or to think about all of those children in care. Or to think about all of those children who live in poverty. With Sarah's murder, we can feel drenched in sorrow and outrage, and put flowers on a bank and weep and turn back with shuddery relief to the ones we love. </p> <p>What about all the other children, whose names we don't remember, whose stories we don't read, whose graves we don't mark, whose loss we never weep over, and who we'd rather prefer not to think about because their tragedies are more complicated and confusing, and come uncomfortably close to us and are still going on, day after day. </p> <p>There's nothing we can do for Sarah Payne, but we could help those other children, if only we put our collective will to it. And with Sarah Payne's death, we can loudly shout (as some journalists have inevitably been doing) for the return of capital punishment. Death's too good for him, monster, animal, fiend. But if the death penalty is wrong, it's wrong for the worst person in the world. It would be far more useful if we were calling for a review of the way we treat active paedophiles, who are rarely cured of their perverse sexuality, and who are often let out of prison after light sentences, only to re-offend. That's too pragmatic, though. It doesn't satisfy the pleasure of hatred and the primitive desire for revenge. </p> <p>On that road to Pulborough, on the A29, I was momentarily reminded of Anne Frank's museum, with its extension, its toilets and its souvenir shop: the necessary tourism of grief. But of course, the extraordinary power of Anne Frank is that she stands for millions of slaughtered children. Through her individual story, we read the history that we must never forget. </p> <p>Sarah Payne stands for no one but herself: a bright, sweet girl loved by her family and friends, whose life was cut short. The meaning that we give to her is the meaning we bring. She stands for our terror. The lost child; the child who never comes home, and you have to wait the rest of your life never to see them again.</p>",

      "bodyText": "There's a long bank of flowers on the A29, on the edge of the field where Sarah Payne's body was found. They lie there in their ribbons and cellophane wrappers, some already fading in the July heat. And there are soft toys, too; hundreds of them among the flowers. Teddies and clowns, hedgehogs, vivid dinosaurs and Beanie babies with bright eyes; some are new, others old and squashed flat by another child's hugs. Someone has put candles there; there are a couple of childish tapestries spelling out Sarah's name in clumsy running stitch; a couple of small wooden crosses. It is a shrine. People make their way here as if they were on a pilgrimage. The road is jammed in either direction; an adjacent field has been made into a special car park. They leave messages. Some are written to the Payne family, expressing sorrow for their loss. Most are to Sarah herself, notes she'll never read like the toys she'll never hold. Few directly acknowledge her death - most talk to her as if she were still alive; they soften the monstrosity of the tale, and its savage ending. They tell her that they know the man will be caught and punished, though they say no punishment could ever, ever be enough. 'Sweet Dreams, Little Princess', they say 'Sleep Tight'. Or 'Sarah, here's a teddy to cuddle while you sleep'. They talk of the beautiful garden that she's in now, safe at last. They leave the prayers that we know from childhood: Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep. And if I die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take. Or the poems that never fail to touch our soft, unstructured yearnings: Do not stand at my grave and weep, I am not there, I do not sleep. I am a thousand winds that blow, I am the diamond glints on snow. Do not stand at my grave and cry. I am not there. I did not die. There are dozens of messages that seem to be trying to cheer her up. One child writes: 'One day you and your mummy and daddy, your brothers and sister will be together again. That's something you can look forward to.' There's a card signed in wonky writing by children who sound as if they knew her and it's like one of those leaving cards everyone signs. 'I'll miss ya!' one child writes; another says: 'I'm sorry you're gone'; another: 'Don't worry, Sarah.' Well, she won't worry now. That's over. And if they speak to her in the present tense, they also speak to her in tones of great intimacy. Darling, they call her, sweetheart, treasure, little love. Her mother came here and laid her own bouquet, but almost all the messages read as if they had been laid there by her mother. For the people who arrive, bearing their offerings, behave as if they had known and loved Sarah Payne. They weep and hold on to each other for comfort. Strangers console each other, united by their common sorrow and their common, spitting hate ('may he rot in hell'). One woman, standing next to me, breaks down. 'I can't read any more,' she says, bending over in grief. Later, I see her being led away, held up by her husband. The scene is inevitably poignant, but also deeply disturbing in the way that the mass outpouring of grief at Diana's death was disturbing. In our secular age, when we have lost the formal consolations of ritual, we find new ways to express our fears and our griefs. Certain events become emblematic. Certain people become icons. Sarah Payne, eight years old, with a shining face and gaps in her teeth, is innocence destroyed. She is the lost child, sanctified by her dreadful death. She is every parent's worst dream. The A29 pilgrims have come here to mourn her, and because they imagine it happening to their child or grandchild. But the grief we feel as voyeuristic strangers is weirdly pleasurable, in a throbbing, melancholy way - like weeping our eyes out at a film. We want to be close to tragedy, while remaining far off. We want to experience it as if it is our tragedy too; our loss, when, of course, it isn't. Real bereavement is very different from this glut of salt tears. 'A nation weeps,' reads one card. Yes, but why exactly does a nation weep over the death of this one little girl? Other children have been murdered this year, and we didn't hear much about them, certainly don't cry for them or remember them by their names. Partly, of course, it is because of the narrative grip that the Payne story has held on us over three weeks. If it had been scripted for a Hollywood tearjerker, it could hardly have been more consummately powerful. An eight-year-old is playing with her brothers and sister in a field on a summer's day, close to her granny's house - this scene is like a metaphor for innocence and carefree youth; think of ears of corn, poppies, floaty cotton dresses, young and happy voices carried by the wind. She falls over, hurts her knees, decides she wants to go home. That's the last we see of her. A white van is spied, driving past the place she would have been. For 17 days, the police search for her. With each day, the agony of the family increases. The media quickly respond to the public emotion, and ratchet it up. Every paper carries her picture: the wide smile, eager face. There are other pictures too - like the one of the mother, Sara, walking along a beach holding her other daughter clutched to her breast. It's an image of both absence (the little girl is not Sarah) and of presence. We have snatches of Sarah's character: how she's a chatterbox. How she's their little princess. The parents give press conferences, clinging to each other, but impressively strong and desperately hopeful - their hope becomes like a prayer. It's as if they believe strongly enough that she is alive, then she will be. She'll be alive because they love her so much and want her back so much. We all know how that feels - we've all imagined losing our children; we've all turned round and seen the space where the body should be, in a supermarket, on the street. That gulp of pure terror. It's a primitive, visceral terror lodged in the deep structure of the brain. For 17 days, Sarah is like a ghost in our world: alive and not alive; somewhere but invisible. She haunts us. Then her body is found, naked, in a field of long grass and tall flowers, rather like the field where she was lost. There's a report that, a few miles from here, some campers heard someone screaming in the night. Later, a single black shoe is found, in a hedge. The agony is being drawn out. We think of Sarah and we think of our own loved one. We imagine Sarah's last moments (the screams, the nakedness), and we superimpose images of our own children on her face. This is the stuff of nightmares and of fairytales. Hansel and Gretel, Red Riding Hood, Persephone: the witch in the hidden house, the wolf in the dark forest, the beautiful girl snatched down into an underworld. The child that is snatched from us. The child that is lost. The child that is calling out for us but we can't hear. The child that needs us, but we're not there. Intolerable. Thus the murder of Sarah Payne has become an instant human myth of innocence destroyed, and also of an unquenchable, never-ending bereavement that her family will feel. The clich\u00e9s of redemption (time heals, that kind of thing) won't do here. There's no getting over this one, only through it. I remember A.S. Byatt, whose son was killed in a car crash when he was 11, saying that it took her the span of his life over again to find life in any way bearable. She said that she knew he was dead and that wishing him back wouldn't work, so she used to pray that she would go mad, and in her madness think he was alive again. Jonathan Dollimore, in his fine book, Death, Desire and Loss in Western Culture, makes the point that only humans experience the death of children as unbearable. Animals habitually lose half their offspring, or more, and hardly notice. But even in times when parents could expect to see several of their children die, it has never been acceptable to us. There is no sadder poem in the English language than William Wordsworth's about his dead daughter, 'Surprised by Joy'. We are alienated from nature, at war with death. Sarah Payne's death brings it home to us that human life is tragic, even while the messages pinned on to the flowers dodge this truth by invoking God, the arms of Jesus, sleep, dreams, beautiful gardens and angels. The death of James Bulger caused the same level of horror and sorrow and emotional identification. I think that was not just because he was murdered by two small boys, but because he was caught on video. We could watch him leaving us, over and over again, on a loop: the toddler putting his trusting hand in the hand of the murderer, and being led away. The grainy image was like a home movie, except home movies always capture happy moments. And with the Bulger murder, as with Sarah Payne's murder, we are suddenly made to feel terrified about the safety of all children, as if no one is safe, innocence is in peril, and terrible men lurk in the long grass, watching, waiting. Strangers feel compelled to come up to you to tell you to keep an eye on your son or daughter: don't let them out of your sight for a minute, not round that supermarket aisle, into that hollow tree, over the brow of the hill. Don't leave them alone for a second, in case the bogeyman should get them. I've heard that some parents are now buying their toddlers reins, so they can literally keep a grip on them at all times. We should let go of those reins, allow our children to play in the cornfields. In this country, between five and seven children are murdered each year by strangers. Between 60 and 80 are murdered by their family. Thousands more are abused. Tens of thousands go missing; there is now a ghost town of runaways in our midst. It might be hard to dwell upon Sarah Payne's death, but it's hard in an easy, lazy, self-pleasing and self-deluding way for it feeds our willingness to think of the world as a Manichean place of good and bad, innocence and evil, bright day and pitch night. It is far easier to think about the stranger in a white van and wish him dead, than to think of the father, the stepfather, the family 'friend', the social worker, the priest; all the people like us. Or to think about all of those children in care. Or to think about all of those children who live in poverty. With Sarah's murder, we can feel drenched in sorrow and outrage, and put flowers on a bank and weep and turn back with shuddery relief to the ones we love. What about all the other children, whose names we don't remember, whose stories we don't read, whose graves we don't mark, whose loss we never weep over, and who we'd rather prefer not to think about because their tragedies are more complicated and confusing, and come uncomfortably close to us and are still going on, day after day. There's nothing we can do for Sarah Payne, but we could help those other children, if only we put our collective will to it. And with Sarah Payne's death, we can loudly shout (as some journalists have inevitably been doing) for the return of capital punishment. Death's too good for him, monster, animal, fiend. But if the death penalty is wrong, it's wrong for the worst person in the world. It would be far more useful if we were calling for a review of the way we treat active paedophiles, who are rarely cured of their perverse sexuality, and who are often let out of prison after light sentences, only to re-offend. That's too pragmatic, though. It doesn't satisfy the pleasure of hatred and the primitive desire for revenge. On that road to Pulborough, on the A29, I was momentarily reminded of Anne Frank's museum, with its extension, its toilets and its souvenir shop: the necessary tourism of grief. But of course, the extraordinary power of Anne Frank is that she stands for millions of slaughtered children. Through her individual story, we read the history that we must never forget. Sarah Payne stands for no one but herself: a bright, sweet girl loved by her family and friends, whose life was cut short. The meaning that we give to her is the meaning we bring. She stands for our terror. The lost child; the child who never comes home, and you have to wait the rest of your life never to see them again.",

      "bodyText": "Back when the internet was still a novelty, Harry Knowles was one of its early stars. Fat, ginger, bespectacled, from the depths of Texas and proud of it all, he was dubbed the man Hollywood was scared of. Not that anyone really was afraid, of course, but Knowles's website - Ain't It Cool News - made a name for itself with casting rumours, reports on yet-to-be-made scripts and, most importantly, reviews from test previews. The studios reputedly warned staff to look out for an overweight guy hiding his hair under a baseball cap sneaking into the supposedly secret screenings. It was all written up romantically, Harry as a shining example of how the net meant fan power could triumph, the hick who beat the supersmooth Hollywood PR system. Now you no longer had to read dull trade magazines to find out about next year's films, or the films that never got made. Harry became so famous he made the leap to appearing in movies himself, getting an embarrassing bit part in The Faculty . That might have been the moment of hubris, because three years on everyone hates him. He is accused of egomania (the little cartoon Harrys all over Ain't It Cool), stealing scoops, taking too many freebies from studios, dishonestly hyping friends' lousy scripts and being involved in video bootlegging. Film Threat magazine has just finished an exhaustive and exhausting three part investigation into Knowles's crimes and misdemeanours, and most other internet movie sites have had their say. Harry says the accusations are rubbish. The scoops and freebies are no different from other journalists' work. And the allegation of bootlegging refers to an employee and had nothing to do with Harry. Harry says they are all just jealous. But the real problem might be even simpler.
