      "bodyText": "Only when every child with a disability has the right to attend a mainstream school will real progress have been made in education, says Rachel Hurst, project director at Disability Awareness in Action. The special educational needs and disability rights in education bill, announced in the autumn, aims to bring this goal closer. The bill sets out to eliminate discrimination and increase young people's access to mainstream education at all levels. Under the new measures, local education authorities will have a duty to set up a parent partnership service to help solve disputes between schools and parents, strengthen the right to a mainstream school place and make changes to the appeal procedures of special educational needs tribunals. In addition, \"the bill envisages a new age, in which disabled students will be able to choose their university on the basis of the education provided rather than just the facilities that it has to accommodate disabled people,\" said Bert Massie, chairman of the Disability Rights Commission, welcoming the bill's announcement. The organisation has been charged with producing a code of practice to accompany the implementation of the legislation, early in 2002. Children with special educational needs, including disabilities, have never had such a high profile within government. But there is still a yawning gulf between the opportunities made available to this group and those on offer to the majority of children. For years, the education system has failed disabled people, who, whatever their age, are twice as likely as non-disabled people to have no qualifications. It will take more than the placement of children with disabilities in mainstream schools to close the gap in opportunity, the Disability Rights Task Force pointed out in From Exclusion to Inclusion, published in December last year. Inclusion is not just about attending a mainstream school, the report said - an inclusive curriculum is an equally important part of the mix. A survey carried out by the Royal National Institute for the Blind last month highlighted the Task Force's concerns. Researchers found that many blind and partially sighted children in mainstream education were struggling to get the help they needed. The respondents revealed they were often given educational materials, such as course books, in a format they couldn't read, rather than in large print, on tape or in Braille. More than 30% received test papers in an inaccessible form, and nearly half said their sight affected GCSE subjects they chose. The Task Force report was taken on board by the government, and many of its recommendations are included in the bill. Schools, local education authorities, and further and higher education institutions will have new duties under the legislation, including taking reasonable steps to change policies, procedures and practices that discriminate against disabled children.

But the draft guidance has run into problems. Charities, including the Down's Syndrome Association (DSA), have accused ministers of watering down the guidelines by ending the requirement to specify in the statement how much extra help children with special needs should receive.

The coaches Ray Wilkins and Graham Rix will have the six months left on their contracts paid off after Claudio Ranieri decided they were no longer needed because he had brought in his own staff. Amid consultations with the club's captain Dennis Wise, Ranieri offered Niedzwiecki and the fitness coach Antonio Pintus the choice of staying on in \"redefined\" roles or leaving with a pay-off. Niedzwiecki has since decided to leave Stamford Bridge, even though Wise paid him a fulsome tribute when asked about his past work at the club by Ranieri. Pintus, about whom Wise was also complimentary, is expected to give a final decision about his future in the next day or so, the managing director Colin Hutchinson revealed. He was responding to reports which claimed that a player revolt, led by Wise, had led to Niedzwiecki and Pintus being reinstated by Ranieri after the Italian had initially decided to dispense with their services. Hutchinson attempted to put the record straight after a week which, even in Chelsea's terms, has been fraught with difficulty amid the pressure of a run of five games without a win. \"Ray Wilkins and Graham Rix left on Tuesday, and their contracts are going to be paid in full,\" Hutchinson said. \"There is no truth in the rumour that there was a player revolt to have them reinstated. \"Eddie Niedzwiecki and Antonio Pintus were given the option of staying on in slightly redefined roles. Eddie has opted to go, while Antonio is still debating and will make his decision in the next 24 hours.\" Aston Villa have offered a new 3\u00ba-year contract to the England goalkeeper David James, which would keep him at the club until 2004. Villa's manager John Gregory wants to reward James for his outstanding form since he moved to the club from Liverpool in the summer of 1999. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "bodyText": "Leeds United's attempts to chip away at Manchester United's dominance of the English game gathered pace last night when they instigated talks with Internazionale about tempting Robbie Keane back to England. After concluded a British-record \u00a318m transfer for West Ham's Rio Ferdinand at the weekend, Leeds hope to negotiate a deal over the next few days that would see Keane spend the rest of the season on loan at Elland Road. The Yorkshire club made their first official approach to the player's representatives and both parties are quietly optimistic about arranging a deal that could lead to a permanent move next summer. Peter Ridsdale, the Leeds chairman, is now waiting to hear from Inter, although his enthusiasm was tempered by the news from Italy yesterday that eight other clubs - Reggina are known to be one - have also lodged an interest in the 20-year-old Republic of Ireland forward. Keane has gone on record this week as saying he wants to stay in Milan despite a turbulent time since his \u00a313m summer move from Coventry. But Leeds understand from his advisers that, contrary to his public utterances, he would relish returning to the Premiership when the Italian transfer window opens in January. After an impressive start to his career with the nerazzurri, \"Baby Irish\" has quickly fallen out of favour at the San Siro since the coach Marcello Lippi was sacked and replaced by Marco Tardelli. He was omitted from the squad for the 6-1 humiliation at Parma on Tuesday with what was described as a back problem, although this was widely seen as Tardelli merely resting the Dubliner rather than risk injury when many potential buyers are vying for him. Even so, Tardelli is extremely unlikely to give Keane a first-team run. \"I got everything wrong for the Parma game,\" said the coach, who rested Christian Vieri and Hakan Suker. \"I will play my best team from now on.\" Leeds are taking a cautious view over the comebacks of another forward, Harry Kewell, who came through a 45-minute performance in the reserves on Monday, and the midfielder David Batty, who has been out for more than a year. Batty, 32 tomorrow, has been pencilled in for the reserve match against Sheffield Wednesday on December 14. The former England player has been training with his team-mates for the last seven days and his agent Hayden Evans confirmed that the player's recovery was well ahead of schedule. \"The original date was always February. But we are very reluctant to consider a target for David's comeback to the first team.\" The Leeds defender Robert Molenaar's \u00a3400,000 move to Bradford City will be completed today after he passed a medical at Valley Parade. The England coach-elect Sven-Goran Eriksson, whose Lazio side entertain Leeds on Tuesday, expects his playmaker Juan Veron to miss the Champions League tie with injury. Despite the growing pressure on Eriksson in Rome - which saw his club's president Sergio Cragnotti leave Wednesday's Italian Cup tie with Udinese early in disgust - the coach remains upbeat about his team, even if a poor display against Leeds could well signal the end of his Lazio career. Eriksson's side could only beat a nine-man Udinese with two goals in the last five minutes. But the Swede countered: \"Lazio is a bomb that is going to explode soon - just wait and see.\" \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

There are 6 Travellers Inns around doing brilliant rates, downtown Travellers Inn is on the corner of Chatham and Douglas I think. Bargain. Also have coffee and cake at Grabba Jabba. <br>2) Take a couple of days out to look around <strong>Seattle</strong>, I took the Quick Shuttle bus that picks up where you want pretty much in central Vancouver and takes about 6 hours to get to Seattle. Return was just over $52 US. Call 604 940 4428 for bookings. Go to Pike Place Market on the waterfront for all the great market stands. <br>3) Take a bus across to North Vancouver and Horseshoe Bay (it was No 250 when I went) and get dropped off at Lighthouse Park. It is forest-covered peninsula with loads of trails that come out on gorgeous rocky outcrops looking into Horsehoe bay and on to Vancouver Island. Nicest thing was that I spent the afternoon there and almost had it to myself, weird really as Vancouver is just around the corner. Beautiful place where you can sit and take it all in. <br>4) Don't even think of missing one of the crepe cafe's on Robson street, excellent food, loads of fillings and great people. Go for Banana and Chocolate. <br>5) Walk all the way around Stanley Park, just because it's really nice. <br>6) If you get a nice day (when the mountains behind North Vancouver are clear of cloud) and take a bus up to Capilano Canyon. From there take the cablecar up to Grouse Mountain. The cloud for me, however did not budge so I saw nothing. Hopefully you'll get lucky and will be able to see all over Vancouver. <br>7) Get hold of Lonely Planet guides-even if you forget everything else. <br>8) Check with locals and various drivers on what rate you should pay for a cab before committing yourself, or you may get stung. Hope that you have a fantastic time and take pictures of everything and buy loads of souvenirs if you've got room to carry them.</p>",

The general, who celebrated his 85th birthday last Saturday, has been under court supervision in Chile since last month, while he is being investigated over 177 criminal offences during his dictatorial rule between 1973 and 1990. Last month, Gen Pinochet made a hesitant admission of responsibility for atrocities the military committed during his rule, saying in a taped birthday message that he accepts \"all the facts.\" He said: \"As a former president of the republic, I accept all the facts that they say the army and the armed forces did.\" However, he also added that some of the accusations against his government are just propaganda. According to a report by the civilian government that succeeded General Pinochet, 3,197 people disappeared or were killed while he was in power. However, any efforts to put General Pinochet on trial are likely to proceed only after neurological and psychological medical tests. The ex-dictator has been recovering from acute pneumonia. The home secretary, Jack Straw, permitted General Pinochet to leave Britain in March this year, arguing his failing health meant he could not go on trial or be extradited to Spain where he faces charges of atrocities.

And I hate elitism because it's just so stupid .\" The society label belies the fact that her designs are simple and classic - not at all the sort of frou-frou creations that scream Hunt Ball. Her name is most often seen \"in the county kind of papers, walking the dogs, Cotswolds kind of papers. They are very, very nice and they do marvellous things for us but it is good to have a bit of a change, isn't it! Stir the stew, flick the fat out!\" </p> <p>She emphasises her point with vigorous stirring gestures. The one customer in the shop - the kind of well-preserved beauty one finds in expensive clothes shops on weekday mornings, with swept-up hair the colour of Dom Perignon - shoots her an alarmed glance. \"Hello!\" Blow booms gaily as the champagne blonde makes a rapid exit. </p> <p>Even though her name is above the door, Blow seems slightly at odds with her genteel Belgravia boutique. Before she arrives, all is calm and quiet. Then in she whirls, carrying six bags, including a leather satchel that spills its contents as she drops it, unfastened, on the floor. She is wearing one of her own coats, in green cord with a tan leather trim, only it is two sizes too big for her, missing a button and covered in white fluff. Her thick black hair is cut into a dramatic bowl shape, like an elegant Blackadder. She is terribly eccentric and terrifically nice. Like a Lewis Carroll character, she talks dizzyingly fast but makes a huge amount of sense. </p> <p>\"What I do is all about tailoring and fabric. I like timeless pieces, clean shapes you can wear with anything.\" Blow usually teams her own tailored pieces with jeans and men's shirts. And for evening? \"Smarter jeans.\" Her beautifully cut coats, single-breasted, bright and dapper, achieve that rare state of being classic but not boring. They are not cheap, but the price is reflected in the quality of the fabric: the \u00a3650 coat is in exquisite red or mustard Harris tweed with leather trim. \"It's a strong look but it's simple and sharp, so it appeals to people from 25 to 75,\" Blow says. </p> <p>She attributes her passion for fabric to her Sri Lankan mother. On the paternal side, her grandfather was the architect Detmar Blow, her father a historian. Selina's brother is married to the famously eccentric fashion editor Isabella Blow. Selina had no formal fashion training, but produced her first collection in 1992 while living in New York. Her early work sold there to Henri Bendel, as well as to Liberty and Harvey Nichols; she returned to London and in 1995 opened her shop. Now 34, she is married to Dr Charles Levinson, has a young son, Gus, and has recently expanded the business to include menswear and childrenswear. </p> <p>Her career as a designer didn't get off to a smooth start. The frock coats for which she is best known were rejected the first time she took them to Bergdorf Goodman, the powerful New York store. \"They said: 'Honey, we don't dress cardinals,' and sent me home.\" Now that they are accepted as a classic, the success of the frock coats is beginning to cramp Blow's style. \"People always say: 'Oh yes, you do frock coats.' Bloody frock coats. I don't just do frock coats!\" She stops and grins. \"The frock coat label is part of the society thing. It's just a bit annoying.\" </p> <p>Nonetheless the appeal of her style lies in its slightly grand, artistic, ceremonial air. Clients range from Anjelica Huston to Ffion Hague, who wore a blue crushed velvet frock coat at the most recent Conservative party conference. \"That was funny about Ffion Hague, she'd just come in and bought it and left. None of that fussing and haggling,\" Blow says approvingly. \"I didn't even know she'd been in.\" </p> <p>Blow knows full well that in the fashion whirlwind, having an identifiable, consistent style might not win the front pages but can save your business. \"Fashion is just so enormous now. If you get absorbed in trends and seasons, you get in a spin, so I've always tried to stick to a formula. But every season we change the shape of the coats. It's a fine balance - a period accent, but not too much, otherwise you hit panto land.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Selina Blow's shop is at 42 Elizabeth St, London SW1, 020-7730 2449.</p>",

The Nasdaq composite index, a benchmark for hi-tech companies, fell more than 4% within minutes of opening yesterday to a 16-month low of 2,592 points. </p> <p>After a decline of almost 50% from its March high, the index is on course for the worst annual performance in its 29-year history. Yesterday's drop was its ninth decline in 10 trading days. </p> <p>Blue chips were also hurt by fears that US consumers and companies had stopped spending. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell almost 1% yesterday morning. Technology shares in London and on other European markets were also under pressure. </p> <p>The Techmark index in London closed down 2.77% at 2,467.75, having fallen every day since November 5. </p> <p>Several well known and widely held stocks were among the biggest losers. </p> <p>Microchip designer Arm Holdings lost 5.4%, Irish e-security expert Baltimore Technologies slipped 8.8% and online auctioneer QXL.com continued its miserable run by slumping 30%. </p> <p>Optical networking specialist Bookham Technologies slipped further under its issue price with a 10% fall, while punters' favourite Durlacher lost 12% to close at 27.5p. </p> <p>Some stocks managed to reverse the trend: CMG added 32p to close at 880p, Marconi put on 24p to close at 670p and Energis edged up 14p to end at 449.5p. </p> <p>Oil prices hardened after Iraq threatened to halt exports of crude from last night unless the United Nations agreed to a new price formula. </p> <p>On the foreign exchange markets, the euro was underpinned by comments from the European Central Bank's president, Wim Duisenberg, who said the single currency was under-valued. </p> <p>\"We can therefore expect a correction - the euro has a strong margin for appreciation,\" he said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Technology shares fell sharply around the globe yesterday as profit warnings from hi-tech companies and fears of a hard landing for the US economy combined to send investors fleeing from stock markets. In a day of frenzied selling the dollar came under sustained pressure on the foreign exchanges amid signs that the euro might have ended its two-year period of decline. The European single currency rose 1.5 cents against the dollar after a new bout of selling on Wall Street, where Gateway, the personal computer seller, and Altera, the speciality chip manufacturer, warned that sales in the current quarter would be far worse than expected. Figures showing a rapid slowing of the American economy, with the number of jobless up and personal spending down, added to the jittery mood. The Nasdaq composite index, a benchmark for hi-tech companies, fell more than 4% within minutes of opening yesterday to a 16-month low of 2,592 points. After a decline of almost 50% from its March high, the index is on course for the worst annual performance in its 29-year history. Yesterday's drop was its ninth decline in 10 trading days. Blue chips were also hurt by fears that US consumers and companies had stopped spending. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell almost 1% yesterday morning. Technology shares in London and on other European markets were also under pressure. The Techmark index in London closed down 2.77% at 2,467.75, having fallen every day since November 5. Several well known and widely held stocks were among the biggest losers. Microchip designer Arm Holdings lost 5.4%, Irish e-security expert Baltimore Technologies slipped 8.8% and online auctioneer QXL.com continued its miserable run by slumping 30%. Optical networking specialist Bookham Technologies slipped further under its issue price with a 10% fall, while punters' favourite Durlacher lost 12% to close at 27.5p. Some stocks managed to reverse the trend: CMG added 32p to close at 880p, Marconi put on 24p to close at 670p and Energis edged up 14p to end at 449.5p. Oil prices hardened after Iraq threatened to halt exports of crude from last night unless the United Nations agreed to a new price formula. On the foreign exchange markets, the euro was underpinned by comments from the European Central Bank's president, Wim Duisenberg, who said the single currency was under-valued. \"We can therefore expect a correction - the euro has a strong margin for appreciation,\" he said.",

Staff have been told that Emap is pulling the plug on the magazine that came to symbolise the Britpop movement. The publisher has promised to relocate journalists on other music titles such as Mixmag, Q or Kerrang or special projects due to launch next year. It is understood that Select's editor, former Mixmag deputy Alexis Petridis, has been approached by TV production companies about a presenting job. Emap managing director for rock, Dave Henderson, issued a statement this afternoon saying: \"Market conditions mean that the indie sector, which Select emphatically championed, has been completely absorbed into the mainstream, illustrated by the huge success of the magazine's core bands - Oasis, Blur and Radiohead.\" Select, which was launched in the mid-90s when bands such as Blur and Oasis were hugely popular, saw its sales decline by 21% at the last ABCs. Mr Petridis was brought in in March to oversee a relaunch designed to reverse the sales decline. He attempted to make the magazine more responsive to the growing numbers of music fans using the internet and introduced MP3 and online sections. But according to insiders, research carried out by Emap demonstrated that Select had lost its brand value. The magazine's closure is being seen as symbolic of the fragmentation of both the music and the magazine industries.

But you'd be wrong. Because today the Edinburgh \"giants\" shook the world of football by appointing the manager of Brazil as their new boss! What's that? Look, we're trying to write a tea-time take on the world of football here. What? Oh.</p> <p>Er ... in fact, they've appointed the manager of Blue Brazil. Sorry about that. Yes, the Jambos have chosen Cowdenbeath boss Craig Levein to be their new head coach. Levein, who made 401 appearances in the Hearts defence, has been rewarded with his dream job after guiding the club with the most \"ironic\" and \"amusing\" nickname in football to the top of the Scottish Third Division.</p> <p>\"I wish him all the best,\" said his predecessor Jim Jefferies, now at Bradford. \"He will find a big difference in divisions from Cowdenbeath to Hearts - it is a big jump up - but I am sure he will do well. He will make his own decisions in his new job and I am sure he will be a success.\" We're sure he'll do well too. In fact, the only problem we can envisage is an inability to come up with a suitably daft wee monicker for his new charges. Maroon Argentina? Post-modern France?</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"We've put Dickov in for a 50,000-mile service. He's run that far for us this year. He's been running for two at times. Credit to the little fella, he's been magnificent and he's just having a rest for a couple of games\" - Joe Royle knows that if you're going to drop someone for Shaun Goater, make sure you've got a damn fine excuse to hand.</p> <p><strong>GIN'S TONIC</strong></p> <p>Earlier this week, the Fiver received a call from a man with a heavy Gallic accent who described himself only as a \"friend of the enigmatic one\". For a brief moment, we were excited. \"What does Antoine de Caunes want with us?\" we asked, as an appearance on Eurotrash beckoned. Alas, it was not to be. Because the heavily accented man wasn't talking about M de Caunes but David Ginola - Aston Villa's overpaid, underplayed and over-the-hill winger!</p> <p>Judging from the comments of Appy Arry's Ammers manager Arry Redknapp - who claimed this morning that \"Ginola was offered to us by one of his mates\" - we weren't the only ones he was being touted to. But it's amazing what the promise of a place in the starting line-up can do for you, because after stropping around like a large camel all week, Ginola was today all smiles. \"I'm very happy at Aston Villa - and don't want to leave,\" he said, flicking his hair in a teasing manner. \"There is absolutely no truth in the stories whatsoever. I'm very happy at Villa and I'm looking forward to playing in tomorrow's game with Newcastle.\"</p> <p>But David wasn't finished there. Suddenly his voice changed, and the UN minesweeper patter took over. \"Whenever a famous player isn't in a team, people make up stories and create situations that don't really exist. In this case it has been pushed to the limit - and I am very angry about it,\" he whined. \"For me, everything about the club is tremendous and I don't want to leave Aston Villa,\" he purred. \"All I want is to see is Villa being successful - with me a part of it,\" he concluded before loading up Championship Manager 3.</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Another day, another Ronaldo rumour. This time it's Chelsea who are \"planning an audacious raid\" to bring the Brazilian striker on loan from Internazionale, according to reports.</p> <p>More likely is the news that Claudio Ranieri is interested in bringing Robbie Keane on loan to Stamford Bridge. Chief executive Colin Hutchinson admitted: \"We are currently looking at various playing options. We are monitoring the situation regarding Robbie Keane and have been in touch with Inter about him.\"</p> <p>Leicester have denied reports that they have agreed a \u00a35.5m with Celtic for Neil Lennon, although Teamtalk claims the Northern Ireland international is in Glasgow for talks.</p> <p><strong>NEWS IN BRIEF</strong></p> <p>Ipswich manager George Burley and Leeds goalkeeper Paul Robinson have picked up the Carling Manager and Player of the Month awards for November respectively. </p> <p>Coventry have completed the \u00a32m signing of Blackburn midfielder Lee Carsley.</p> <p>Robert Molenaar has joined Bradford from Leeds in a \u00a3500,000 deal.</p> <p>Newcastle manager Bobby Robson is hoping to sign Chinese international defender Sun Jihai, who has been on trial at St James' Park. \"Jihai would be a real asset,\" said Robson. \"We were only allowed to look at him for a maximum ten days but he was fine and we liked what we saw. He's dynamic, enthusiastic, quick, strong and the only area where he needs quite a bit of work is in the air.\"</p> <p>Walsall have signed former Barcelona, Southampton and Toulouse midfielder Ronnie Ekelund on a short-term contract.</p> <p>Blackburn winger Keith Gillespie has joined Wigan on a month's loan.</p> <p>Charlton striker Kevin Lisbie has joined QPR on a month's loan.</p> <p>Keith Burkinshaw has resigned as Aberdeen's director of football.</p> <p><strong>TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO</strong></p> <p>Sky Sports 3: Hold the Back Page (10pm) \"Did you know Brian Woolnough is known as Moosehead by the players of Manchester United?\" asks Michael Hann.</p> <p>Sky Sports 1: Live International Schoolboy Football: England v Scotland (7.00pm) No we didn't - although we did know that Ian Wright calls the bouffanted one Bisonhead.</p> <p>Premier League Review (11.30pm) Arsenal and Manchester United players in rare agreement shocker!</p>",

Levein, who made 401 appearances in the Hearts defence, has been rewarded with his dream job after guiding the club with the most \"ironic\" and \"amusing\" nickname in football to the top of the Scottish Third Division. \"I wish him all the best,\" said his predecessor Jim Jefferies, now at Bradford. \"He will find a big difference in divisions from Cowdenbeath to Hearts - it is a big jump up - but I am sure he will do well. He will make his own decisions in his new job and I am sure he will be a success.\" We're sure he'll do well too. In fact, the only problem we can envisage is an inability to come up with a suitably daft wee monicker for his new charges. Maroon Argentina? Post-modern France? QUOTE OF THE DAY \"We've put Dickov in for a 50,000-mile service. He's run that far for us this year. He's been running for two at times. Credit to the little fella, he's been magnificent and he's just having a rest for a couple of games\" - Joe Royle knows that if you're going to drop someone for Shaun Goater, make sure you've got a damn fine excuse to hand. GIN'S TONIC Earlier this week, the Fiver received a call from a man with a heavy Gallic accent who described himself only as a \"friend of the enigmatic one\". For a brief moment, we were excited. \"What does Antoine de Caunes want with us?\" we asked, as an appearance on Eurotrash beckoned. Alas, it was not to be. Because the heavily accented man wasn't talking about M de Caunes but David Ginola - Aston Villa's overpaid, underplayed and over-the-hill winger! Judging from the comments of Appy Arry's Ammers manager Arry Redknapp - who claimed this morning that \"Ginola was offered to us by one of his mates\" - we weren't the only ones he was being touted to. But it's amazing what the promise of a place in the starting line-up can do for you, because after stropping around like a large camel all week, Ginola was today all smiles. \"I'm very happy at Aston Villa - and don't want to leave,\" he said, flicking his hair in a teasing manner. \"There is absolutely no truth in the stories whatsoever. I'm very happy at Villa and I'm looking forward to playing in tomorrow's game with Newcastle.\" But David wasn't finished there. Suddenly his voice changed, and the UN minesweeper patter took over. \"Whenever a famous player isn't in a team, people make up stories and create situations that don't really exist. In this case it has been pushed to the limit - and I am very angry about it,\" he whined. \"For me, everything about the club is tremendous and I don't want to leave Aston Villa,\" he purred. \"All I want is to see is Villa being successful - with me a part of it,\" he concluded before loading up Championship Manager 3. THE RUMOUR MILL Another day, another Ronaldo rumour. This time it's Chelsea who are \"planning an audacious raid\" to bring the Brazilian striker on loan from Internazionale, according to reports. More likely is the news that Claudio Ranieri is interested in bringing Robbie Keane on loan to Stamford Bridge. Chief executive Colin Hutchinson admitted: \"We are currently looking at various playing options. We are monitoring the situation regarding Robbie Keane and have been in touch with Inter about him.\" Leicester have denied reports that they have agreed a \u00a35.5m with Celtic for Neil Lennon, although Teamtalk claims the Northern Ireland international is in Glasgow for talks. NEWS IN BRIEF Ipswich manager George Burley and Leeds goalkeeper Paul Robinson have picked up the Carling Manager and Player of the Month awards for November respectively. Coventry have completed the \u00a32m signing of Blackburn midfielder Lee Carsley. Robert Molenaar has joined Bradford from Leeds in a \u00a3500,000 deal. Newcastle manager Bobby Robson is hoping to sign Chinese international defender Sun Jihai, who has been on trial at St James' Park. \"Jihai would be a real asset,\" said Robson. \"We were only allowed to look at him for a maximum ten days but he was fine and we liked what we saw. He's dynamic, enthusiastic, quick, strong and the only area where he needs quite a bit of work is in the air.\" Walsall have signed former Barcelona, Southampton and Toulouse midfielder Ronnie Ekelund on a short-term contract. Blackburn winger Keith Gillespie has joined Wigan on a month's loan. Charlton striker Kevin Lisbie has joined QPR on a month's loan. Keith Burkinshaw has resigned as Aberdeen's director of football.

The apology relates to comments attributed to BBC sources about last Monday's edition of the blockbuster ITV game show, in which Judith Keppel became the first contestant to win \u00a31m. The show was scheduled against the last ever episode of BBC1 comedy One Foot in the Grave. In a humiliating public U-turn, the BBC said it \"does not believe there was any 'manipulation' or 'fixing' involved in Millionaire?\".

      "bodyText": "Charity managers Ruth Wyner and John Brock, jailed for allowing drugs to be peddled at a Cambridge hostel for the homeless, were today told by the court of appeal that they would not have to return to prison. Although three judges in London reserved their decision on the appeals against conviction brought by the pair - who were released on bail in July pending today's hearing - they made the dramatic announcement that the sentences imposed on Ms Wyner and Mr Brock, both 50, were \"far too long\". William Clegg QC, prosecuting, told the judges that, if they were to quash the convictions, the Crown would not apply for a retrial. Lord Justice Rose, sitting with two other judges, said the court was going to take time to consider its judgement on the appeal against conviction, but said, \"we are not minded... to send the appellants back to prison\". The so-called Cambridge Two, Ms Wyner and Mr Brock were freed on bail in July by the court of appeal. However, they were warned that they might have to return to prison if they failed in their challenge to convictions of knowingly permitting the supply of heroin at the Winter Comfort Centre. Ms Wyner, director of the centre, was jailed for five years last December. Mr Brock, a manager, was sentenced to four years. They were present in court today for the hearing before Lord Justice Rose, sitting with Mr Justice Longmore and Mr Justice Ouseley. In July the pair were granted leave to appeal on the grounds that the presiding judge at their King's Lynn crown court trial wrongly barred the jury from considering subjectively a major plank of the defence case. The charity had operated a policy of confidentiality under which information about the homeless and vulnerable people who attended the centre would not generally be passed on to outside agencies, including the police. Michael Mansfield QC, for the pair, argued that Judge Jonathan Haworth erred in not allowing the jurors to consider whether, in the light of that widely-accepted policy, Ms Wyner and Mr Brock acted reasonably in not telling the police what they knew about drug dealing. The jailing of Ms Wyner and Mr Brock has been a cause of concern for workers at hostels and day centres across the country. Some charities began turning away drug addicts and suffered staff shortages because people were unwilling to run the risk of imprisonment for failing to inform on those seeking shelter. Earlier today, as she entered the royal courts of Justice in London to cries of \"good luck\" from supporters, Ms Wyner said: \"I am fairly optimistic we will get justice here.\" She said that the ruling which appeal judges Lord Justice Rose, Mr Justice Longmore and Mr Justice Ouseley made could have a major impact on those working with the homeless. She also warned that, following her experience, homeless workers could now be worried about openly liaising with the police about drug problems among their clients. She said: \"The case has very wide implications for homeless centres as a whole, so I feel nervous about that as well as my own personal situation. \"Basically, John and I were never accused of any involvement in the drug dealing or drug use. \"If you work with drug addicts, there is implicit knowledge that some (drug) exchanges will take place. Is that 'knowingly allowing'? \"If it is, it would mean homeless agencies cannot work with people using drugs without breaking the law themselves. \"At Winter Comfort, we thought we had a good liaison set up with the police. We talked openly about our problems and concerns about drug use among our clientele. \"It seems they used that against us. Staff working with the homeless are now likely to be very worried about being open with the police - I certainly would be after my experience.\" A new petition has been launched calling for Section 8 of the 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act - the section under which Ms Wyner and Mr Brock were convicted - to be rewritten. The Cambridge Two Campaign, which launched the petition, said that it had been backed by trade union Unison, national drugs helpline Release, Cambridge MP Anne Campbell, Worthing West MP Peter Bottomley, and The Big Issue magazine. Alexander Masters, the chairman of the campaign, said: \"This is an extremely important issue, as the convictions of Ruth and John showed. \"Section 8 is dangerous law which creates tension between the police and charity workers. Until Section 8 is rewritten, it will be impossible for charities working with the homeless or with drug users ever to feel safe.\" Related stories 28 November: Case that left homeless out in the cold 12 July: Cambridge Two freed pending appeal 10 July: Leader - the unlikely criminals 2 January: Comment - Jailed for doing her job",

      "bodyText": "Terry Venables will not be returning to management with Middlesbrough after talks broke down today. The former England manager has been lined up to take over from Bryan Robson. But Boro chief executive Keith Lamb admitted that talks had foundered over Venables's commitments to television, and that he would not be joining the club. Lamb said: \"We have concluded that Terry's present and future television commitments are incompatible with the role we were offering him here at Middlesbrough. We have now brought our discussions to a close. We wish him well in his role as a television football pundit. \"We can assure our supporters that everyone at Middlesbrough will now continue to focus on the Premier League challenge that lies ahead.\" It now appears that Robson will continue in charge into next year. Before the announcement, Robson had said: \"If he [Venables] doesn't take a position here I would be in charge until the end of the season.\"",

Mr Bush's lawyers claimed that Florida's highest court \"plainly rewrote the election laws\". The Republican team hoped to convince the nation's highest court that the late-counted votes were unlawfully added to the pivotal Florida totals, while Mr Gore's lawyers were urging the justices to let those votes stand. Ninety minutes of oral arguments in the extraordinary case were scheduled for this morning and access to the public gallery has become the hottest ticket in Washington for those hoping for a glimpse of history. Not since the Watergate scandal of the 1970s have the nine members of the US supreme court been so firmly in a presidential minefield. It was not known how soon the justices might rule, although in a few cases where the timing was urgent they have taken as little as one day. However, the justices' decision will not dictate who becomes the next president. A ruling for Mr Gore would hold Mr Bush's lead at 537 votes and let the vice president pursue more votes in a state-court contest that could put him over the top. A ruling for Mr Bush probably would push the Republican candidate's lead back to the 930-vote margin he had before the hand recounts were added to the Florida totals. Mr Gore still could gain votes if state courts ordered more recounts, but a supreme court loss could create heavy pressure on him to give up the race.

Of around 30,000 people who are expected to be infected, about 16,000 will have been through homosexual sex, 11,500 through heterosexual sex and about 1,500 through drug abuse.

They have never stopped killing each other, of course, but the latest round of bloodletting is different: it's taking place not in Kosovo, but in Serbia itself. A small band of ethnic Albanian rebels has seized control of hilltop positions along part of Serbia's sinuous border with Kosovo. They have been active in the area for much of the year, but, in the past few days, they have stepped up their attacks, killing four Serb policemen. The area is home to much of Serbia's sizeable ethnic Albanian minority. Many of them live in the five-kilometer demilitarised zone that was set up on Nato's insistence at the end of last year's war. The Yugoslav army is barred from the demilitarised zone, which is patrolled by lightly armed Serb police, horribly vulnerable to guerrilla ambush. The rebels call themselves - with the pomp and bravado so dearly loved by such men - the Liberation Army of Presevo, Medvedja and Bujanovac. Those are the main Albanian population centres in southern Serbia. Almost certainly, however, the guerrillas are not based in Serbia, but are cadres of the Kosovo Liberation Army, which fought a desultory war against the Yugoslav army before Nato's polyglot army, Kfor, took over the province. Since the arrival of the Nato forces, the KLA has atrophied and splintered. Denied a primary role in the emerging government or in the fledgling police force of Kosovo, it has also been outflanked politically by the leading political moderate, Ibrahim Rugova. Now, it seems, militant KLA members have decided to revive their irredentist war and carry it to the Serbian enemy. The implications for Nato are chilling. If the guerrillas provoke the Yugoslav military establishment into returning to the border buffer zone, their soldiers will be eyeball to eyeball with Kfor troops. The Nato soldiers apparently have neither the stomach nor the means to prevent KLA men crossing the border, but they will be obliged to prevent any Serb military incursion into the buffer zone. Had Slobodan Milosevic remained in power, the danger would be more imminent. As it is, the new leader in Belgrade, Vojislav Kostunica, has talked reassuringly of restoring calm and seeking a political solution. But Kostunica is also insisting that Kfor take control of its side of the border and stop the guerrilla incursions. He knows that the Serbs, after their abject rout by Nato last year, are in no mood to be further humiliated by a ragbag bunch of mountain fighters in their own country.

      "byline": "Jo Clifton",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>If you were sent 42 memos in one day detailing your supposed faults and failures, would you feel managed or bullied? This is what happened to Alan, a senior manager, whose boss used this tactic to control, threaten, and ultimately destroy his workers. Unfortunately, some managers feel that this is the only way to get people to work effectively, but research shows that the opposite usually happens. The targets of this behaviour, through fear, can start to underperform, which often leads to increasing sickness leave. </p> <p>In addition, other staff will be doing just enough work so as not to draw attention to themselves, reducing the amount of effective and creative work they carry out. The bully, meanwhile, is pursuing private agendas, not organisational objectives; and staff, time and resources are not being managed effectively. If each of Alan's memos took approximately 15 minutes to write, send and read, that's three and a half hours out of the working day! </p> <p>Recent research has found that the majority of people experience bullying in their workplace; either as the target, or as a witness to the bullying behaviour. The National Workplace Bullying Advice Line reports that 20% of its callers are from education, 12% from the health services and 10% from social work, while the fastest growing number of callers in 1998 were from the voluntary sector.</p> <p>Research also suggests that certain environmental conditions and organisational structures actually encourage bullying behaviour and a bullying culture. These include frequent organisational change and uncertainty, an authoritarian style of supervision, and no clear codes of acceptable conduct. This last issue is a major factor in the perpetuation of bullying. How can you complain if you don't know what is allowed and what isn't?</p> <p>Without the bottom line of reduced profits and performance, how can non-profit organisations assess the cost? One telling factor is the expense of recruitment and training - reckoned to be approximately \u00a35,000 for each new member of staff. The average cost of sickness absence is also \u00a3485 annually. These sums are a significant drain on the limited amounts of money available to finance the project or organisation.</p> <p>The hidden financial aspects can be quantified by monitoring factors such as absence records and staff turnover. If you assess the amount of work left undone as a result, then you can see that there will be a lack of innovative and development work actually happening.</p> <p>The cost of not dealing with bullying can be substantial. The Health and Safety Executive now includes bullying and harassment as a significant source of stress in the workplace. If employers know that employees are being put under undue, and inappropriate stress, and do nothing to address the cause, they are failing in their duty of care, implicit in employment law, and may be liable to action under health and safety law. In the case of Ballantyne vs South Lanarkshire council, a social worker who was forced into early retirement because of the \"outspoken\" and \"abusive\" behaviour of her boss won \u00a366,000 in an out-of-court settlement.</p> <p>In journals and conferences, the issue of workplace bullying is gaining greater visibility. Targets are starting to recognise what is happening to them and employers are acknowledging that the problem exists. But, until there is some formal recognition through legislation, we may only be able to tackle the problem on a piecemeal basis and not as a strategic and integrated change of culture.</p> <p>\u0095 Jo Clifton is an independent consultant based in central Scotland, working primarily in non-profit sectors.

      "bodyText": "If you were sent 42 memos in one day detailing your supposed faults and failures, would you feel managed or bullied? This is what happened to Alan, a senior manager, whose boss used this tactic to control, threaten, and ultimately destroy his workers. Unfortunately, some managers feel that this is the only way to get people to work effectively, but research shows that the opposite usually happens. The targets of this behaviour, through fear, can start to underperform, which often leads to increasing sickness leave. In addition, other staff will be doing just enough work so as not to draw attention to themselves, reducing the amount of effective and creative work they carry out. The bully, meanwhile, is pursuing private agendas, not organisational objectives; and staff, time and resources are not being managed effectively. If each of Alan's memos took approximately 15 minutes to write, send and read, that's three and a half hours out of the working day! Recent research has found that the majority of people experience bullying in their workplace; either as the target, or as a witness to the bullying behaviour. The National Workplace Bullying Advice Line reports that 20% of its callers are from education, 12% from the health services and 10% from social work, while the fastest growing number of callers in 1998 were from the voluntary sector. Research also suggests that certain environmental conditions and organisational structures actually encourage bullying behaviour and a bullying culture. These include frequent organisational change and uncertainty, an authoritarian style of supervision, and no clear codes of acceptable conduct. This last issue is a major factor in the perpetuation of bullying. How can you complain if you don't know what is allowed and what isn't? Without the bottom line of reduced profits and performance, how can non-profit organisations assess the cost? One telling factor is the expense of recruitment and training - reckoned to be approximately \u00a35,000 for each new member of staff. The average cost of sickness absence is also \u00a3485 annually. These sums are a significant drain on the limited amounts of money available to finance the project or organisation. The hidden financial aspects can be quantified by monitoring factors such as absence records and staff turnover. If you assess the amount of work left undone as a result, then you can see that there will be a lack of innovative and development work actually happening. The cost of not dealing with bullying can be substantial. The Health and Safety Executive now includes bullying and harassment as a significant source of stress in the workplace. If employers know that employees are being put under undue, and inappropriate stress, and do nothing to address the cause, they are failing in their duty of care, implicit in employment law, and may be liable to action under health and safety law. In the case of Ballantyne vs South Lanarkshire council, a social worker who was forced into early retirement because of the \"outspoken\" and \"abusive\" behaviour of her boss won \u00a366,000 in an out-of-court settlement. In journals and conferences, the issue of workplace bullying is gaining greater visibility. Targets are starting to recognise what is happening to them and employers are acknowledging that the problem exists. But, until there is some formal recognition through legislation, we may only be able to tackle the problem on a piecemeal basis and not as a strategic and integrated change of culture. \u0095 Jo Clifton is an independent consultant based in central Scotland, working primarily in non-profit sectors.

Doubling the present \u00a31,000 tuition fee for subjects with lower expected lifetime earnings and tripling it for medicine, dentistry, veterinary science, computer science, engineering, law and business administration would raise more than \u00a31bn for universities in England, calculated consultants London Economics in a study for the vice-chancellors. But, as only half of all students pay fees because of the means test, more than half of that money would have to come from the government. Charging wealthy families the average cost of fees (\u00a34,000) would bring in an extra \u00a3259m, equivalent to an increase of \u00a3264 a student in English universities and colleges. But vice-chancellors have not ruled out the option of allowing universities to set their own fees as they do for overseas students, ranging from \u00a35,000 for an arts course to \u00a314,500 a year for a medical degree. Sir Howard Newby, president of Universities UK, predicted higher education would get only brief mentions in the party election manifestoes and admitted increased tuition fees were politically dangerous.\"One of the choices the government has to face is whether it wants to see a well-resourced sector able to maintain quality and compete globally and provide resources for teaching and research,\" he said. \"If it is not prepared to fund them from the taxpayer, over a period of time it should introduce some form of contribution from students and their parents.\" David Blunkett, the education secretary, made plain his continued opposition to top-up fees in his instructions to the higher education funding council for England published today.

      "body": "<p>New NHS guidance on security in Ashworth, Rampton and Broadmoor special hospitals has rejected the more draconian recommendations of the Tilt report. This is good news for patients and has prevented an exodus of 'progressive' staff.</p> <p>In the fallout from the Fallon Inquiry into Ashworth Hospital, the government asked Sir Richard Tilt, former prisons director, to lead a review of security in all three high-secure hospitals. This was published in February and was as welcome as a bowl of cold vomit by most clinical professionals.</p> <p>The great challenge in these services is setting a fine balance between the therapeutic environment and the security needs of a complex and vulnerable group of people. </p> <p>We know from the catalogue of inquiries into these hospitals that failure to get the balance right has devastating effects. The problem that many had with the Tilt review was that it attempted to offer blanket solutions to a patient group that is anything but homogenous.</p> <p>It did not recognise the needs of women, who rarely abscond, escape or seriously subvert security. The needs of patients from ethnic minority groups were largely ignored. The needs of mentally ill people, as opposed to those living with personality disorder, were not considered separately. </p> <p>In short, the Tilt review sought to impose a prison culture to security in what are essentially NHS hospitals.</p> <p>The government has responded to Tilt by issuing new security guidance to the hospitals. This offers a more pragmatic view of these issues.

      "bodyText": "New NHS guidance on security in Ashworth, Rampton and Broadmoor special hospitals has rejected the more draconian recommendations of the Tilt report. This is good news for patients and has prevented an exodus of 'progressive' staff. In the fallout from the Fallon Inquiry into Ashworth Hospital, the government asked Sir Richard Tilt, former prisons director, to lead a review of security in all three high-secure hospitals. This was published in February and was as welcome as a bowl of cold vomit by most clinical professionals. The great challenge in these services is setting a fine balance between the therapeutic environment and the security needs of a complex and vulnerable group of people. We know from the catalogue of inquiries into these hospitals that failure to get the balance right has devastating effects. The problem that many had with the Tilt review was that it attempted to offer blanket solutions to a patient group that is anything but homogenous. It did not recognise the needs of women, who rarely abscond, escape or seriously subvert security. The needs of patients from ethnic minority groups were largely ignored. The needs of mentally ill people, as opposed to those living with personality disorder, were not considered separately. In short, the Tilt review sought to impose a prison culture to security in what are essentially NHS hospitals. The government has responded to Tilt by issuing new security guidance to the hospitals. This offers a more pragmatic view of these issues. The new guidance allows the board of each hospital a greater degree of discretion as to how some of the more restrictive arrangements might be applied to individual patients. The guidance also makes it clear that the patient's responsible medical officer and the hospital medical director will have a vital say in how the more restrictive elements of the guidance will or will not be applied. This must be welcomed. If we are detaining citizens against their will in conditions of high security by reason of problems primarily related to their mental health, then it must be right that a clinician must have a lead role in security decisions as they apply to the individual. These hospitals have operated a regime of 24-hour care in wards for many years. Prior to this, patients in the hospitals were \"banged up\" in their rooms through the night, much as prisoners are. Tilt recommended that \"the feasibility of locking rooms at night of all patients on admission and intensive care wards, and all 'high-risk' patients, should be examined\". This reflects the wrong thinking behind the review. In effect, this was suggesting that at the very time people are at their most vulnerable, i.e., when newly admitted and full of anxiety and fear, or in need of intensive care, they be locked in their rooms overnight. The implications such an approach might have had on increased rates of suicide and self-harm beggars belief. The new guidance thankfully rejects this approach and leaves such decisions to be applied by the clinical team on the basis of the needs of the individual patient. New arrangements for the routine testing of patients for use of illicit substances are introduced, alongside a raft of policies to control the use of TV, videos, CDs or telephones. Most are sensible, but again, allow the policies to be applied in a manner that need not compromise the clinical care of patients. However, it is regrettable there remains a risk that women will have these new arrangements applied to them in a discriminatory manner. The guidance also brings in crucial new procedures for searching staff and visitors. Talking to many people living in these hospitals, it is clear that collusion from some corrupt and unethical staff and from visitors lies at the heart of some of the more serious breaches of security. Just how can a mobile phone, electronic surveillance equipment, hard core pornography and heroin find their way in to such an environment? The answer is via someone outside the secure perimeter. As of now random searching of staff and visitors and the routine use of X-ray on their bags will become standard. In short, the more workable elements of the Tilt Review have been kept, the more extreme rejected. How this came about is interesting. I spoke to many senior clinicians in all disciplines in the hospitals when the Tilt Review was published. Without exception they were deeply depressed with much of the review. One able psychiatrist assured me that implementation of Tilt in full would lead to a mass exodus of more enlightened practitioners from these services. The chief executives of the hospitals had the unenviable task of conveying the serious nature of the views of good staff to ministers, who clearly wanted something done, and quickly. I never believed I would say this, but thank God we had a czar. I understand that this thorny issue was handed over to Professor Louis Appleby, the new National Director for Mental Health by John Hutton, the minister responsible for high-security hospitals. Professor Appleby worked with the hospitals to ensure that the systemic security improvements were put in place, but that good clinical care could continue. While this is good news for the more progressive staff, the people who reside in these hospitals and might I say, the security of the public, the guidance does little to alter the totally dysfunctional nature of these places. Tilt recommended the spending of some \u00a325 million on new physical security for the hospitals, yet there has not been an escape since 1994. We also know that government are intent on moving most women out of these hospitals and are likely to implement new arrangements for the care, support and containment of those with a more serious personality disorder next year. These hospitals are therefore likely to become smaller, with a better focus and merged within mainstream NHS Trusts. The money currently being poured into physical security could be much better spent on a credible estates management plan, ensuring the hospitals are better suited to their future role.

      "bodyText": "A woman saw 10-year-old Damilola Taylor walking alone towards an alleyway just four minutes before he was found bleeding to his death on a stairwell after being stabbed, it emerged today. News of the potentially crucial witness came as Damilola's father Richard was reunited with his family in London after flying in to London's Gatwick airport from Lagos, Nigeria. It also emerged today that a child who was seen being marched along a road near the murder scene in Peckham, south-east London in a headlock on Monday afternoon was not Damilola. Detectives will today speak to a boy and a girl who were filmed with Damilola on CCTV going into a library for an after-school computer class. The two children, who are not suspects, have been identified by police, and officers will ask them what Damilola was saying in the hour before his brutal death. Police are also exploring the possibility that Damilola was followed from the library by his attackers. Detective superintendent David Dillnutt, who is in charge of the inquiry, disclosed that a female witness spotted the boy walking past her home along Cronin Street in Peckham at about 4.45pm. At 4.49pm, a member of the public rang the emergency services to report a boy bleeding to death on a stairwell on the North Peckham estate. Damilola left a 100-yard trail of blood as he tried to flee his attackers. He was bleeding heavily from a stab wound to his left leg. Police are hunting three black youths who were wearing dark clothing and were seen running away from the murder scene. Officers are also seeking information in relation to a reported bottle fight between youths outside the library where Damilola had gone to take his computer class at about 4pm. Police were called to the fight but found no evidence of a disturbance. Yesterday, it was disclosed that a second knife was found about 200 metres from where Damilola lay bleeding to death. That blade, along with another knife and a shard of glass, are still undergoing forensic tests. Detectives are also investigating a note found in Damilola's locker at Oliver Goldsmith primary school containing the name of one boy who may have been bullying the Nigerian-born youngster. The dead boy's mother, Gloria, had voiced concerns to the school about bullying of her son the day before his death. More than 40 detectives are working on the case - the biggest murder hunt in London since the Jill Dando investigation. The home secretary, Jack Straw, made a direct appeal for help in tracking down those responsible for what he called the \"evil\" killing. Mr Dillnutt said that children with information should not be frightened to come forward and if they were worried about speaking to police then they should talk to their parents, teachers or other community leaders, he said.

      "bodyText": "A positive week. It started with the coming together of housing's management team with mine. This is a regular event now and there is evidence that constructive work is happening between staff outside the meetings to try to solve problems that are (at last) being seen as common rather than the fault of the other party. We'll know we've really made progress when social workers stop berating housing for being unable to provide clients with four-bedroom houses with gardens in Streatham and start advising clients about realistic options, thereby avoiding pointless wrangles which get played out in court to the displeasure of all concerned - except the lawyers of course. We have had some joint sessions aimed at getting staff to feel like colleagues who work for one organisation, and will be doing more in future. Reflected on these and other organisational peccadilloes when I met with the Improvement and Development Agency team who have been with us this week doing a \"peer review\". By the time they got to me it was near the end of their visit - so they had obviously begun to hone their thoughts and seemed to be highly perceptive about the state of the authority. It was quite therapeutic to be talking to people who understand what it is like to be in the furnace and don't want to merely stand outside and turn up the heat. The report will be out in four weeks. My mind is more on the forthcoming special council meeting at which the joint review report will finally be presented and to which the Barratt report and social services inspectorate inspection have been requisitioned for a further chewing over. I shall be presenting the joint review action plan (no diary of mine can be complete without the mention of at least one action plan - as I am sure you are beginning to realise) and need to sharpen my PowerPoint skills. I found myself dreaming of flying bullet points whizzing impressively on to the screen - but the list was all about my daughter's fourth birthday party ...",

The list is made up of the largest companies by market capitalisation, calculated by the total value of their shares. Favourites for the chop are internet security company Baltimore, computer services group Sema and chip-maker Bookham Technology. They are set to be replaced by supermarket giant Safeway, the Scottish &amp; Newcastle brewer and engine maker Rolls-Royce. UK technology shares have been hammered by a series of profits warnings from US giants such as Dell and Lucent, with uncertainty over the US presidential election increasing market jitters. However, fund managers expect a minor revival for put-upon tech stocks before the end of the year. Colin McLean at Scottish Value Management said: \"There will be a recovery, but it will be selective. People will focus on the larger stocks looking for bargains.\" Mr McLean said the lack of new share issues, which tech companies use to get a quick cash boost, have allowed old economy companies to rise up the stock market listings on the back of organic growth. Internet and technology upstarts have fallen due to mounting losses and panic-selling by investors. The techMARK index in London has lost 43% of its value over the past three months, while the tech-rich Nasdaq listing in New York has shed nearly half its value since March.",

      "bodyText": "Up to 25 staff at the Daily Express and Daily Star have received Lord Hollick's notorious \"goodbye-and-thank-you\" bonuses of up to \u00a340,000 each. Sources say that the Labour peer, who sold the newspaper group last week for \u00a3125m, has handed out cheques worth \u00a31m to journalists on the two papers. Up until now it was believed that just a dozen of Lord Hollick's favourite staff had received the cash. The love-list is believed to include right-wing columnist Peter Hitchens and City editor Patrick Hosking, who has been at the paper for little over a year. Sunday Express editor Michael Pilgrim and three senior staff on the Daily Star have also pocketed the surprise windfalls, including the paper's editor, Peter Hill and his deputy Hugh Whittow. The bizarre bonus scheme is already creating bitter divisions among newsroom staff. Other names on the list include Express number three Chris Williams, features editor John Price, comment writer David Robson and political editor Anthony Bevins, who quit the paper earlier this week in protest against the arrival of new owner Richard Desmond. Star columnist Dawn Neeson is also believed to have received a cheque and, according to sources, Express diarist John McEntee's name was also on the list. Both Mr McEntee and Chris Williams have denied they have received \u00a340,000 however. Express sports writers Martin Samuel and Rob Shepherd were singled out for the windfall, too, as was columnist Peter Oborne. Up to now only five names on the list were known including Rosie Boycott, her deputy Chris Blackhurst and chief City correspondent David Hellier, who have all admitted they received the cheques. The silence of the other beneficiaries, however, will shock staff, particularly those who have considered themselves loyal, hardworking and perhaps more deserving of bonuses. \"Some of the people on this list have only been here two seconds.

      "bodyText": "A new breed of young criminals, many as young as 10, are committing street robberies because they believe it will give them credibility and status in neighbourhoods they regard as \"lawless\", Scotland Yard said yesterday. Sir John Stevens, commissioner of the Metropolitan police, said a recent rise in robberies around London reflected \"a new phenomenon\" - playground bullies taking their intimidation and menace outside school. Many of the offenders targeted pupils they knew and put pressure on the victims not to come forward for fear of reprisals. Although the Met recognises little research has been done in this field, it believes there is enough anecdotal evidence from officers on the beat, as well as worrying statistics from selected boroughs, to conclude a trend is emerging. Sir John's remarks yesterday had particular resonance because the killers of Damilola Taylor, the 10-year-old who bled to death in a south London council estate stairwell on Monday, are thought to be from his age group. Describing Damilola's death as \"shocking and tragic\", the commissioner said 40 officers were now working on the case full time and every back-up support was being offered. Referring to recent figures from the west London borough of Hounslow, Sir John said 70% of street robberies were committed by youths under the age of 17. He said 72% of the victims were also under 17, and 40% of the offenders had never been in trouble with the police before, and were surprised they had been arrested. Commander Tim Godwin said some of the teenagers spoke of earning \u00a3300 a week from street crime. They stole pocket money, mobile phones, credit cards and Pokemon cards, he said. In one case a boy told officers how he stole money to give to his parents. But cash was not the sole or most important motive of those involved. Street crimes were often committed as a rite of passage by youths who were under pressure from their peers, Mr Godwin said. Sir John said: \"What we are witnessing is a new breed of criminal.

They did not like the new part of the estate much either and now the murder had made things worse. </p> <p>Spencer was robbed in February by children his own age as he came out of a chip shop.\"I had just spent \u00a310 and they stole all my food,\" he said. \"There was three of them and I was on my own.\" </p> <p>The pair said children regularly carried weapons in Peckham. Spencer said: \"I've had a knife put on me three times here. I know lots of people round here who carry knives.\" </p> <p>Cheryl felt scared unless she is with one of her brothers. Fingering a chunky gold necklace, she said: \"If I went out on my own my jewellery would get nicked off of me and so would my mobile phone.\" </p> <p>Spencer said it was easier for Cheryl because she had her brothers for protection. He did not have anybody and he was keen to stress that he did not carry a knife. \"If they can't fight with their own hands they shouldn't carry weapons.\" </p> <p>Like most other children on the estate, Cheryl and Spencer have been talking about the murder and picking up rumours. Spencer said: \"I heard two boys talking about it and how they know the person who killed the boy.\" </p> <p>In the window of the heavily-shuttered shop just one landing above where Damilola died, a sign reads: \"Only two children/youths at a time.\" </p> <p>The shopkeeper said he could not cope with more. \"They are just nasty kids. They come and steal things and pinch things from the till and shoplift.\" </p> <p>Damilola must have passed here in the seconds before his death, he must have turned the corners in this rat-run of almost 20 miles of deck landings. He would have run past the workers using heavy machinery to remove concrete amid clouds of dust, he may have glimpsed the piles of rubbish. He could have caught the strong smell of urine in these corridors. </p> <p>Downstairs are yellow signs appealing for witnesses to the murder but in spite of all the talk very few people have anything to say. Sade Bikini passes the signs as she comes up the rank stairs that lead to the scene of the child's death. A 16-year-old pupil at Alwyn girls' school, she was sure that those of her friends fuelling the rumour mill knew nothing about what really happened. </p> <p>She was also adamant that North Peckham estate was getting a bad press. She did not fear its dark corners, she said. The estate was not as bad as everyone made out. </p> <p>\"Some of this gang stuff people are coming out with is rubbish,\" she said. \"The Peckham Boys don't hang around here. It's not that violent and I don't feel threatened.\" </p> <p>Dressed in school uniform and in high spirits, six girls waited for a bus on Rye Lane. Latita, 16, said she did not like to go out alone. Her mother laughed at her when she asked to be accompanied from her home to the bus stop. \"The only way to feel safe is to go out with my friends. We won't get touched if we stick together.\" </p> <p>Further up the road, outside Warwick Park school two boys watched children pour out of the building.

You could be stylish and snug, cutting-edge and comfortable, all at the same time because that was the age when the pashmina was a highly desirable article. But then high street outlets joined in and fashion magazines snootily deemed the poor shawl deader than the shahtoosh. </p> <p>So what to do now to stay warm and look elegant? Manufacturers have plumped for the novel idea of promising us the same as before, yet fashionably different. The net result - any item draped around a model's neck is The New Pashmina. </p> <p>So what is it? Well, first there were stripy scarves, which utilise the pashmina's winning formula of colour plus warmth. The best examples were last year's versions by The Gap and Jo Gordon. Now there are Prada's fur tippets (cheaper, faker versions are already available in high street outlets, such as Oasis), Miu Miu's furry collars, Luella's black and white wool scarves, Burberry's wraps, Paul Smith's long stripy numbers, Donna Karan's cashmere wraps...

      "bodyText": "Ah, the golden age of 1997. Life was so much simpler then, wasn't it? You could be stylish and snug, cutting-edge and comfortable, all at the same time because that was the age when the pashmina was a highly desirable article. But then high street outlets joined in and fashion magazines snootily deemed the poor shawl deader than the shahtoosh. So what to do now to stay warm and look elegant? Manufacturers have plumped for the novel idea of promising us the same as before, yet fashionably different. The net result - any item draped around a model's neck is The New Pashmina. So what is it? Well, first there were stripy scarves, which utilise the pashmina's winning formula of colour plus warmth. The best examples were last year's versions by The Gap and Jo Gordon. Now there are Prada's fur tippets (cheaper, faker versions are already available in high street outlets, such as Oasis), Miu Miu's furry collars, Luella's black and white wool scarves, Burberry's wraps, Paul Smith's long stripy numbers, Donna Karan's cashmere wraps... And don't forget summer's fashion leitmotif, the pretty crocheted vintage shawl - not much cop for warmth, lovely to look at, though. And the pashmina itself is the new pashmina - if it's embroidered/multicoloured/bleached/beaded/ bereft of its tassels.

So think ruched boots instead of legwarmers; an off-the-shoulder jumper but in a muted, solid colour; a recognisably designer bag (a Burberry tote, Bottega Veneta's woven leather handbag) but not one emblazoned with gold initials.

Forget about trends; we all want to look and feel glamorous, youthful and just a little bit fashion fabulous, whatever the year. So go on, let a little Ivana back into your life.

They borrowed money for the wedding - and a bit more for the second attempt. </p> <p>The second attempt took place in August 1994. It failed. \"You are informed by phone whether it has worked.\" said Beverley. \"That is general. But when you are paying all that money, you at least expect someone to comfort you.\" </p> <p>She and Dean were distressed and ever deeper in debt. It became too much, and they split up. \"I pushed my husband away and went back to my mum's. But we realised we wanted children of our own and we would have to be strong. We took out money for a third attempt.\" </p> <p>Beverley was unhappy with the clinic, so they changed to one recommended by a friend. She felt the new consultant was more positive. \"He said: 'I'm going to get you pregnant.' Him being so positive made me feel much stronger.\" </p> <p>The treatment began in September 1997 and was successful. Beverley was told she was carrying triplets, but at 20 weeks, one baby died in the womb. The couple were sad, but decided it was meant to be. She gave birth to twin girls, Tara and Rosie, nine weeks prematurely. The twins, now two and a half, are thriving. </p> <p>Beverley and Dean were delighted, but had a huge debt, which she puts at \u00a318,000. While she was still pregnant, they sold their home to pay it off and went to live with Dean's parents two months before the twins were born. Eventually the council housed the family in a two-bedroom flat. Two years later, with both working, they managed to buy another house, but she felt she was losing out through not seeing enough of her babies. Now Dean is doing two jobs so she can spend time with the children she desperately wanted. </p> <p>Money is still tight. She understands that the NHS cannot pay for all fertility treatment, \"but just one attempt would have helped\".</p>",

      "bodyText": "The \u00a3660m redevelopment of Wembley Stadium has run into severe problems which are threatening the future of the entire project, it emerged yesterday. The world's most expensive stadium development needs to raise \u00a3410m from City banks, which are understood to be reluctant to put money into the project. The redevelopment, which includes pulling down the landmark twin towers, is already behind schedule and problems over financing could delay the project by more than a year, meaning that it might not open until 2005, two years behind schedule. When plans for the new stadium were unveiled last year, Wembley National Stadium Ltd (WNSL), the Football Association subsidiary company set up to oversee the project, proclaimed that the new stadium would be open in time for the 2003 FA cup final. The date was then put back to early 2004, but with finance for the venture still not guaranteed even that looks unlikely with the bulldozers yet to move in. The big banks are concerned about projections for revenues which could be generated at the redeveloped stadium. Concerns that they will be saddled with negative publicity on the scale of the Millennium Dome are also said to be a deterrent. The terms under which the money is being raised may need to be altered to entice banks to back the plan. The demolition of the existing stadium has been postponed twice already. Under the original plans work was due to begin last month after England's defeat by Germany. But it was first rescheduled for December and is now unlikely to begin this year. Chase Manhattan, a major US bank which specialises in raising money for large projects, has been hired by Wembley to find financial backers. But one senior banker approached by Chase said: \"They are finding it very, very difficult to get partners. There are very real concerns about the rough revenue projections for Wembley. It's pretty unlikely we will back it\". Another said: \"Wembley just isn't like big stadiums in the US where they've got the home team turning up every week. They have only 16 or 20 sport ing events a year, limited to football and a bit of rugby, the wind and the rain and the whims of rock stars to go on tour.\" Another major hurdle is the fact that the financing is being structured as an unsecured deal, according to the banker. If the company fails, the lenders will not have rights over the stadium in support of their loan. According to the prospectus which Chase Manhattan has drawn up, much of the increased revenue for the new Wembley is expected to come from sales of the more expensive seats, many for corporate hospitality. The plans include 150 boxes, of which 30 are thought to have been reserved already. Under the terms being touted by Chase Manhattan, the stadium could be prepared to pay almost 8% in interest starting from 2005, resulting in a likely annual interest payment of some \u00a330m, although the amount of interest is linked to revenues generated by the ground. The loan is for 20 years. A WNSL spokesman said that they hoped to have the \u00a3410m loan secured before Christmas and that demolition work on the old stadium would also have started by then. It is believed WNSL wants to secure the backing of 10 banks who would each pay \u00a341m. The spokesman added: \"We are not concerned if some banks are scared off by adverse publicity because there are still enough banks interested in the project. \"We have a number of agreements to stage events at the the new Wembley. The banks may come to us with one or two questions but we are confident that we will be able to address their concerns.\"",

Some of the 20mph limits will become 40mph ones, while some of the 40mph limits will go up to 60mph. The changes, which are likely to be introduced next week, will offer beleaguered passengers the first glimmer of hope of better services since the Hatfield crash more than six weeks ago. \"We will be easing restrictions not so much on a region by region basis but on the basis of what engineers say is safe,\" said a Railtrack spokesman. More details of the revised restrictions were given by Railtrack's new chief executive, Steve Marshall, at a news conference at the company's London headquarters. Passengers have endured weeks of chaos on the railways due to the restrictions imposed after Hatfield, the track-checking work and the severe floods a month ago. Meanwhile, the rail recovery action group set up by the government was meeting for the first time today to supervise efforts to restore normal train services. The group, headed by transport minister Lord Macdonald, was set up as Downing Street let it be known that Tony Blair wants to see rail chaos ended by Christmas. The meeting came a day after it was revealed that thousands of travellers were deserting rail to make domestic journeys by air. \"Passengers are becoming increasingly fed up at what they see as continuing and unnecessary delays in getting the rail network back up to speed,\" said John Prescott, the deputy prime minister. \"Railtrack, the train operators and government have got to work together to tackle this. That is why I have asked Gus Macdonald to head up a special rail action group to maintain regular contact with the industry and ensure they are totally focused on the issue, day to day.\" The group will consist of senior representatives from Railtrack, the Association of Train Operating Companies, the Rail Passenger Council, the Health and Safety Executive, the Office of the Rail Regulator and the Shadow Strategic Rail Authority. The key tasks of the group will be to: \u0095Work closely with Railtrack and the train companies in resuming normal service as quickly as possible, while keeping risks as low as reasonably practicable; \u0095To keep the public and ministers fully informed on progress of the recovery plan; \u0095To help trouble-shoot any unresolved issues delaying full recovery. Mr Prescott added: \"I am pleased to say that our meeting with Railtrack today was very constructive. They are now in discussions with the HSE regarding the possibility of lifting a number of the current speed restrictions and the terms under which this might happen.\" Airlines British Airways, Ryanair and British Midland have all reported huge increases in domestic travellers in recent weeks, with particularly high rises on services from London to the north of England and Scotland. Lord Macdonald's appointment followed a Cabinet meeting yesterday morning at which the rail chaos was discussed. \"There was an acknowledgement that it is pretty grim out there for passengers and things have got to get better,\" a Downing Street spokesman said. The cost to business of the crippled rail network has been \"considerable\", according to the Institute of Directors. A survey of 200 IoD members showed that the average small business has lost \u00a314,500 since the Hatfield crash, while larger companies have lost \u00a342,000 each. Commuters still faced serious delays today after Tuesday's derailment at Northampton. Just four trains in the area were able to run. A substitute coach service remains in place and a spokesman for train operator Silverlink, said that the company hoped to run more trains on Monday.

      "body": "<p>Rhetorical trumpets sounded and drums beat inside Downing Street yesterday as the prime minister and his generals assembled to celebrate an important victory. The flagship manifesto promise - 250,000 long-term unemployed young people into jobs - has been more than met, under budget and ahead of time. \"Rejoice!\" David Blunkett said, denouncing the \"nothing works\" cynics. </p> <p>In truth, it wasn't much of a news story. It has been obvious for well over a year that the new deal was working very well, a modest but solid success. Independent audits from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research showed that 164,000 young people who had been unemployed more than six months had all found jobs at least six months sooner than they would have done without help: the rest might have gone straight into jobs anyway. It cost an average \u00a34,000 per job and at that price the scheme just about pays for itself in saved benefits. </p> <p>At the height of the 1980s slump, half a million young people had no prospect of work - a lost generation, many of whom never recovered. Now there are only 37,000 long-term young unemployed left and the number is falling fast. Yesterday wasn't news - but imagine if the new deal had failed or if it had cost a great deal more per job. The dome would have paled into insignificance as an emblem of New Labour disaster. That's the trouble for governments - targets achieved, goals met, promises kept are dull. So yesterday ITN didn't mention the new deal result at all; the BBC gave it 10 seconds. Only failures are fun. </p> <p>In human terms, the new deal has lifted up thousands of young people: to be out of work with nothing to do for six months is a long time for a drifting 18-year-old. The magic ingredient is the personal adviser, a job now hotly competed for, with its satisfying results. The weary, depleted, old Employment Service has sprung into new life. Ninety per cent of new deal clients talk in glowing terms about their personal advisers, who see them right through even when they are in work. Some telephone their advisers at night for help. </p> <p>Most have never had an adult personally assigned to them before. One adviser swapped clothes with his client so he could send him off to an interview respectably dressed. He wore the boy's jeans and Man U T-shirt for the day; the boy got the job. If doubters want a taste of some real good this government has done, a session sitting in on new deal interviews is heart-warming stuff. </p> <p>But then come the stark reality checks: a dead boy in north Peckham is a shocking reminder of the wastelands still to be rescued, how many people, how difficult it is to change places left to fester for the past 20 years. Government spending so far has only nibbled round the edges; there is more to come, but little yet. </p> <p>The full force of what it really means to inherit a society where one in every three children is born poor is starting to sink in with Labour. Even the big increases in benefits for children don't fix all this quickly. Even if schools get better, many of these children will still end up at 18 with the new deal as their last resort. As years go by, these will increasingly be the hardest cases, for whom all else has failed. The later they are found, the larger the sums that need to be spent on treatment, counselling, intensive education, whatever it takes to get them on to their feet and into society. </p> <p>The new deal was allocated \u00a32.6bn over four years. It has spent only \u00a31bn, so there is money that should now be spent on high-intensity programmes for the toughest cases, old and young. It is cheaper than waiting for them to end up in prisons or mental hospitals. A target of getting 70% of single parents into work will be hard to hit while there are still very few affordable nurseries. Above all, to reach full employment the chancellor has to abandon one great ideological barricade and spend money where he swore he never would - on job creation in the most blighted areas where no amount of training magics up non-existent work. </p> <p> Nonetheless, hitting that new deal target is an important emblem of Labour success - and the starting pistol for the election campaign. It is also a stake through the heart of the Tory party. Yesterday they struggled to find anything coherent to say about it and their response is a revealing dry run for the plight they will find themselves in next May. Wherever they turn, they skewer themselves. </p> <p>Yesterday they tossed out a fog of mendacious figures, all desperate stuff. They claimed the new deal cost \u00a35.2bn instead of \u00a31bn. They claimed Labour inherited only half the target number when it came to power - conveniently leaving out the 14,000 more coming on to the books every month. \"The new deal is a spin operation. It claims credit for finding people jobs they would have found anyway.\" Why? Because the economy is so strong, but how can the Tories admit that? </p> <p>They promise to scrap the programme, privatising it with bonuses for every job new contractors find. It will cost, they claim, \u00a31,000 less per job. Where will that cut fall? On education and training - the high-value part of the new deal. Never mind that many of these young people are illiterate and innumerate, private employment agencies will bundle them into jobs anyway. \"Employers don't want all this waste on training,\" said the Tory spokesperson. Nor workers who can read and write? No. </p> <p>Michael Portillo is said to be tired of the game; he wants out. Maybe he's a sleeping crocodile but it wouldn't be surprising if he really has had enough. Who could blame him for not facing another arid four years of opposition? Trying to oppose the new deal epitomises their problem. It is virtually impossible to oppose most of Labour's major programmes for schools, the NHS or the poor except with lies and the odd ideological privatisation devised for the sake of it. Rarely can politics have seemed more pointless than inside the Tory party now. The sterile search for anything different to say must be deathly toil. Never mind what works, all that matters is contriving something plausible to say. Forget honesty, oppose everything. If Portillo wants to get a life instead, why not? </p> <p>This is an easy government to criticise from the left - two no-spending years, no income-tax rises, too anxious to please middle England, too frit to lead, kissing the boots of the Tory press that kick it daily. But how do you attack from the right? Seeking clear blue water, Hague has landed the Tories on a desert island alone with their own ageing clan, tax-cutting, social-programme-slashing, 1950s-moralising, Europhobic, mad little Englanders. The harder Hague tries, the worse things get. </p> <p>The only time Tories might indulge in delusions of victory is when they look across the floor of the House and see a government bench still so easily, needlessly frightened. There is only one interesting question about the next election - will the quiet success of most of what Labour has done so far nerve them to be braver? Is there a bolder plan to come? </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Computer publisher VNU Business Publications has been forced to back down on new contracts for freelance journalists. The firm's retreat follows claims that the contracts would seize all online rights and limit writers' opportunities to sell their work on to other titles. A spokesman admitted that the company was redrafting the contracts after consultation with staff and freelances. Freelance writers objected to a clause in the contract that classifies all preparatory work done as part of an interview or article as the property of VNU. They say this would have limited their ability to earn income from different sources. The contract also banned freelance journalists from accepting any free gifts, which many said potentially included paid-for press trips - a staple of the IT press. They were also angered by a clause that they claimed would leave them to pick up the bill for any legal action incurred by their stories. One long-term freelance said: \"VNU wants all of the privileges of being an employer without any of the obligations.\" Another said that many freelances took the view that the most appropriate response was \"to screw up the contracts and throw them back in their faces\". The contract, which has been seen by MediaGuardian.co.uk, stated that changes had to bring VNU's contracts in line with those of Ziff-Davis - the IT publishing firm that VNU acquired earlier this year. But a VNU spokesman said that the contracts were standard in the industry. \"It's not VNU's intention to take all online rights,\" he said. \"Press trips have not been banned, and if you go on a trip and want to do a story for a newspaper, that's fine. Some of these freelances have interpreted this story wrongly.\" And he denied that freelances would be forced to take legal liability for stories, saying: \"VNU is simply saying, 'Don't open us up to unnecessary legal challenges'.\"",

The blonde hair is shorn and modern, her limbs taper like sculpture. Her skin is bright. But she radiates, rather than being radiant. She has none of the princessy confidence of the knowingly perfect. Her beauty is a conversation. </p> <p>Lips figure prominently in Blanchett's latest release, The Man Who Cried, written and directed by Sally Potter. Arch sensualist Potter has assembled a quartet of voluptuous mouths belonging to Blanchett, Christina Ricci, John Turturro and Johnny Depp. Set in pre-war Paris, the fashion for glossy pillar-box red accentuates the deliciously puffy curve of Blanchett's top lip to the extent that, at times, it appears to be acting by itself. In one scene, Blanchett's character, Lola, observes her lover flirting with another woman across the dinner table. Potter's camera gaze lingers on her lips as they pout, stiffen and sag. It's all the viewer requires to know that a dream is shattering. </p> <p>Lola is an ambitious Russian dancer, a loquacious, energetic soul who battles the displacement of the age, making compromises to survive and ultimately renegotiating what constitutes survival. \"It was great to play someone who interacted with the world so physically. She experienced loss and immediately needed to find something to replace what she'd lost. After playing Susan Traherne, whose brain orbits around memory and abstract concepts, it was great to play someone who was very visceral.\" </p> <p>The desperate, disillusioned heroine of David Hare's seminal post-war drama Plenty is clearly a character with deep resonances. The 31-year-old Australian played Traherne last year in Jonathan Kent's 10th anniversary revival of the play for the Almeida Theatre Company. Although initially touted as yet another movie star flouncing through the footlights for a taste of stagecraft credibility, Blanchett has a sturdy theatrical background, as her critically acclaimed performance proved. Raised in Melbourne, she graduated from Australia's National Institute of Dramatic Art in 1992. She worked extensively with Company B, a loose ensemble that included Shine star Geoffrey Rush, and appeared in Caryl Churchill's Top Girls and David Mamet's Oleanna for the Sydney Theatre Company, winning a Sydney Theatre Critics' award for the later role. But perhaps the emotional impact of playing Traherne was augmented by the excessive circumstances of the moment. \"It was a very strange confluence of events last year,\" she muses, \"when I just happened to be in the West End at the time that all that Oscars rubbish was going on...\" She catches her drift, laughs at it. \"Not rubbish, it was fantastic. I probably call it rubbish as a way of dealing with it.\" </p> <p>Nominated as best actress, for her portrayal of the title role in Shekhar Kapur's Elizabeth (for which she also won a Golden Globe), she was inevitably pitched against the more fragile, less Australian Gwyneth Paltrow, who scooped the award for her part in Shakespeare in Love. Surely, pined the press, they must loathe one another. \"Awful,\" she drawls. \"It becomes a horse race. But thank Christ I'm surrounded by people with amazing senses of humour. And it was great to be doing my work [rehearsing for Plenty]. I literally went for the weekend and came back to the church-hall rehearsal-room atmosphere of the Almeida. It was 'Did you have a good time? Yep? Anyway, so on to page...' That made it much easier to cope with it.\" </p> <p>She will not feign disinterest though. \"I found the whole thing fascinating. I still do. But somehow all that stuff ends up getting reported like you're participating in it, and I couldn't have participated less. It's undeniably wonderful and of course you undeniably entertain the thought 'what would I do if I won?' But it is in the past now. So many things have happened since, but those things aren't as public. The spectre that haunts me more than the Oscars is having played Susan Traherne.\" </p> <p>Perhaps another reason that Traherne remains so vivid for her relates to her forthcoming role as a young resistance fighter in Nazi-occupied France. She is to play the eponymous heroine in Gillian Armstrong's film adaptation of the Sebastian Faulks novel Charlotte Gray. She first read the book as preparation for her role in Plenty, and has worked with Armstrong previously on her adaptation of Peter Carey's Oscar and Lucinda, another of the many happy coincidences that seem to beset Blanchett's career. She tells of \"bumping into\" Kapur in a bar when he was casting Elizabeth. Her role in The Man Who Cried \"felt like an accident\", arising via her previous connections with production company Working Title and her former drama teacher's friendship with Sally Potter. One could distrust this, but she's too genuine to elicit cynicism. This woman has no side to her. Which is not to say that she is without complexity, that she does not change her mind, or have secrets. But there is a realness to her, a decency and an engagement with the wide world that is fresh, like the smell of good soil after a downpour. </p> <p>She is very funny. She has a wide laugh. She is whole-hearted, and appears to have no side to her. She likes chance, the tango, her home Australia. You can imagine that she really enjoys talking about the taste of food. And it must be this firm-footedness that allows her such versatility on stage and screen: the prom queen gaudiness in Pushing Tin, her peachy rectitude in An Ideal Husband, the tremulous gawking in The Talented Mr Ripley. </p> <p>Anthony Minghella, who directed her in Ripley, once described her as having a \"hotline to the heart\". He said: \"What happens when the camera rolls is a remarkable transformation... the glimpse of soul, tiny flashes of joy and pain, and [she] is apparently incapable of a lie. It's as if she is letting you into her secrets. This is the albino quality, the chalky phosphorescence of her Elizabeth.\" </p> <p>Acting, she says, is like telling a dirty story. \"People always treat me like I'm being coy or untruthful if I say there's no grand plan, that acting is just an interesting thing that I found myself doing. It's not an end point.\" Is she ambitious? \"What do you mean by that?\" she asks sharply. \"It's such a dirty word, you know. When people ask that, what they really want is an admission of ruthlessness. I don't think I am ruthless.\" Perhaps they mean to ask if you're hungry? \"Or greedy... I'm hungry but I don't know if I'm greedy. I'm in an environment that tempts the greedy, and, like anybody, of course I have been, I'm not a saint. But you have to be honest about those flaws. You have to remain open to failure. I don't live in a particularly safe way. Of course I don't stand in the middle of the road, but I'm not frightened of pain. I don't want to be in a situation where I'm acting like a studio executive.\" </p> <p>But ambition can be about passion too. Is she passionate about her \"accidental\" career? \"I like a challenge, and I find it thrilling to leap into situations that are bigger than me. I suppose that's the accident. It's what you throw away as much as what you choose to hold on to - it's what you say no to.\" So has she become more self-conscious about those choices, the more success she garners? \"People judge you,\" she says. She smiles, remembering. \"Last year, a woman from Ipswich sent me a letter saying how dare I not curtsey to the Queen when she visited the Almeida. I thought 'what is she talking about?', because I had rung the palace and said, 'I've never met the Queen before, what does one do?' They told me it was a very informal meeting - in the past, people had curtsied and people hadn't. So I turned up at the theatre, and suddenly there were Australian television cameras there because the republican debate was going on. I said, 'Do you want to know if I'm a republican, well, yes I am', and obviously that became [she drops her voice to the sandpaper rasp of a republican hoon] the bold Australian who says 'Fuck you!' And all of a sudden I wasn't curtseying to the Queen! I thought 'I had no control over that'.\" She is, laughing, bemused. \"But you move on. That's the strength that comes out of it. You're responsible, but you have to be a bit cavalier about it, and not as sensitive.\" </p> <p> Supported, too. She met her husband, script editor Andrew Upton, in 1996. Despite their peripatetic careers, they spend plenty of time together: \"It's a priority,\" she says simply. Although the couple have been nominally based in London for the past few years, they work flexibly around each other, recently returning to Sydney where Upton was working on a production of Cyrano. \"It's constantly evolving. My photo is in the paper more often than his is, but it doesn't mean that my career is prioritised.\" </p> <p>And what about wee ones? \"I'd like wee ones,\" she says gently. \"There have been a few additions to the family lately, and when you meet someone you want to have wee ones with, it's exciting. But it'll happen when it happens. I'm not taking my temperature, or trying to fit it in around work. I don't think that's a particularly great way to bring children into the world. They'll come when they come.\" </p> <p>She has enjoyed perching in London, she says, though she's homesick. She is indulgent of the British version of Australia (\"that older sibling thing\"), but is currently much exercised by the Howard government's attack on arts funding. She says that she hugely admires Olympic medallist and Aboriginal rights campaigner Cathy Freeman. She is interested in and interesting about all manner of subjects, though she dislikes explaining herself. \"I think everyone loves clarity. It's much safer. But I'm incredibly incoherent, so people have to be satisfied with the incomplete sentence.\" She laughs again. Cate Blanchett, completely. </p> <p> \u0095 The Man Who Cried is released next Friday.

I've got a pair in my bag and when I go to wherever... but if you add up all those paper napkins and all those chopsticks and all those plastic bags from Sainsbury's... it's terrifying!\" Cate Blanchett's diamond eyes widen part in horror, part in mirth as she bowls through her environmentalist's tirade, wholly believing in what she says, though not succeeding in taking herself seriously. Does she always manage to have a spare plastic bag with her? She gestures to the mammalian huddle of wigs at her feet, the remnants of the day's costume fitting. \"The milk and bread will go in the bag with the wigs tonight,\" she announces, all competence. Her voice is both firm and yielding, inviting soft impressions like wet cement. \"The bags that my grandma used to have are fantastic, very practical. They look like a wallet, but then you unzip them and pull the bag out. They're like those little rain hats.\" Rainmates? \"Yes, Rainmates! They're great!\" Her face creases with glee, and one senses that a foldaway plastic bag with a Rainmate attached would bring Cate Blanchett extreme joy. She pauses. \"It's a terribly intimate question to ask when I don't even know you, but do you have any lip salve?\" She applies. She is delightful to watch.

It's the Manhattan of expensive cars pulling up outside fabulous apartment buildings with a long canopy stretching across the sidewalk - and it's a slight jolt when the car is a Lexus rather than a bulbous Buick. Everything about it sits more easily in the Jazz Age. </p> <p>Allen is Ray, an incompetent criminal married to \"Frenchy\" (Tracey Ullman), a former exotic dancer. Together, they take the lease on a store a few doors down from a bank so that they can tunnel into it. But the home-baked cookies Frenchy sells in the fake \"store\" become so wildly successful that this phoney operation becomes more lucrative than any bank-job. </p> <p>At which point a much less interesting second act is ushered in. The newly wealthy Frenchy tries to better herself with the help of a creepy British art dealer - an excellent performance from Hugh Grant, his best since An Awfully Big Adventure - while Ray yearns for the simple life he has left behind. </p> <p>And they all behave as if Calvin Coolidge or Herbert Hoover is in the White House. Nothing in it looks contemporary, and it would take just a second to amend the script to place it in the same era as Bullets Over Broadway. Frenchy's giant nationwide cookie franchise, for example, certainly doesn't have a website. She airily hosts a dinner party and tells her guests: \"I saw a beautiful painting of fruit... at the Met, or, er, the Whitney, or the Holocaust...\" It's one of many big laughs, but something in Tracey Ullman's stagey Guys-and-Dolls accent makes you think for a second: what Holocaust? </p> <p>All this is part of Allen's new production line of snappy, undemanding plot conceits, drained of both the autobiography and European anxiety of his earlier work and finding a comfortable new home, overtly or not, in the America of the Marx Brothers. (Perhaps not entirely drained of the autobiography: the soundtrack includes Zelda's Theme, composed by his most ferocious critic over the Soon-Yi affair - Andr\u00e9 Previn.) </p> <p>The abysmal failure of the plan to tunnel into the bank is actually about modern corporate capitalism being more profitable than any romantic outlaw daring. (Mike Myers had a similar idea with Dr Evil's \"Starbucks\" operation being more successful and less troublesome than global wickedness.) </p> <p>What keeps this lightweight, shallow movie going is the succession of cracking one-liners, applied like mega-volt goads, continuously prodding the body of the film and zapping it awake. There are too many to quote here, but Allen surely gives his audience their money's worth with his and Frenchy's furious exchanges as they prepare for the new social whirl Ray dreads. \"Escargots? Snails? A snail leaves a trail of scum!\" - \"Not in France!\" Later Frenchy becomes infatuated with the idea of eating truffles: \"They're so subtle only pigs can find them.\" </p> <p>Woody Allen's own appearance in the film is a curiosity. Playing a character perhaps 30 years too young for him, he demonstrates that all his mannerisms remain eerily the same while he himself gets older. The tics are hard-wired into the script and they will appear in whoever plays the Woody role, as John Cusack showed in Bullets, or, even more notoriously, Kenneth Branagh in Celebrity. </p> <p>Funny stuff, of course, all of it, except for the new aggression and unpleasantness with which he experimented in Deconstructing Harry. Many a time in this film he threatens Frenchy with an old-fashioned beating (\"I oughta slap your head off\"), and the effect is jarring and superfluous. </p> <p>The real success of this middling Allen comedy, and a source of great frustration, is the terrific performance from Elaine May as Frenchy's stupid cousin May. She's brought in to help out at the bakery and Ray eventually finds that he has more in common with her than with Frenchy, with all her airs and graces. May's maladroitness and slowness is achieved with a superb actor's intelligence, and it is a performance that puts Tracey Ullman's hammy TV-sketch-show turn in the shade. But there is nowhere in the script for May to go, so all that energy remains unharnessed. </p> <p>Small Time Crooks feels like the kind of halfway decent film Allen can make without breaking sweat. Whether he has a big movie left in him is anyone's guess.</p>",

Many a time in this film he threatens Frenchy with an old-fashioned beating (\"I oughta slap your head off\"), and the effect is jarring and superfluous. The real success of this middling Allen comedy, and a source of great frustration, is the terrific performance from Elaine May as Frenchy's stupid cousin May. She's brought in to help out at the bakery and Ray eventually finds that he has more in common with her than with Frenchy, with all her airs and graces. May's maladroitness and slowness is achieved with a superb actor's intelligence, and it is a performance that puts Tracey Ullman's hammy TV-sketch-show turn in the shade. But there is nowhere in the script for May to go, so all that energy remains unharnessed. Small Time Crooks feels like the kind of halfway decent film Allen can make without breaking sweat. Whether he has a big movie left in him is anyone's guess.",

His lawyers argued that English courts had no power in law to extradite him to the US because of lack of evidence and because he could only be extradited for a crime on US territory, where Al Fawwaz had never set foot. They also said the FBI relied on anonymous witnesses whose reliability Al Fawwaz could not challenge. But Lord Justice Buxton, sitting in London with Mr Justice Elias, ruled that evidence of Al Fawwaz's part in the setting up and operating of a secure telephone line and the use of a satellite phone system in the US \"provided a prima facie case of conspiracy\" on US territory even though they might be \"susceptible of an innocent explanation\". Al Fawwaz is to appeal by petition to the House of Lords.",

A couple of hours before Kevin Keegan's team emerged from the famous tunnel to face Germany in a World Cup qualifying match, the chief executive of Wembley National Stadium plc rose to his feet in the press lounge and started to outline the bright future that was about to begin. </p> <p>Illustrating his talk with architects' drawings, Bob Stubbs described not just the rebuilt sports arena in north London, with its soaring 350ft high Norman Foster arch and its 150 premium-priced VIP boxes, but the 200-bedroom hotel, the rentable office space, and the lavish facilities for conferences and banquets built into the design. The demolition men would move in to prepare the way, he said, virtually as soon as the valedictory celebrations for the old twin-towered stadium were over. </p> <p>What Mr Stubbs did not know was that the bulldozers would go for the team before they attacked the stadium. England lost the match, and Kevin Keegan resigned. Yesterday the timetable in the official Wembley website was still giving November 2000 as the date for the start of demolition of the original stadium, based on a structure built in 1923. But apart from the pitch itself, which has been torn up, and some of the fixtures and fittings, which were sold off in a televised auction earlier this month, the scene of England's World Cup triumph of 1966 remains virtually untouched, while the deadline for raising \u00a3450m of backing from City banks is postponed again. </p> <p>Building a national stadium to replace the decaying Wembley edifice should have been a reasonably straightforward affair. The Stade de France, Cardiff's Millennium Stadium and Sydney's Stadium Australia were all completed in time to host prestige events, each built at less than half Wembley's projected cost. And since the owners of the new Wembley are the Football Association, the governing body of a sport so prosperous that it pays teenage players salaries of tens of thousands of pounds a week, the apparent difficulty in raising the cash might seem even more mystifying. </p> <p>But rebuilding Wembley was never straightforward. First mooted in the early 1990s, it was originally planned as a joint project between Sport England, which administers National Lottery funds, and Wembley plc, the private company that owned and operated the stadium. When the two bodies could not agree terms, a different plan emerged under which the FA would buy the stadium from its former owners and, having created a new wholly owned subsidiary company called Wembley National Stadium plc, would collaborate with Sport England to build a venue suitable for the grandest sporting events, with bids for the 2006 World Cup and the 2012 Olympic Games in mind. </p> <p>When the new company came into being, chaired by Ken Bates, an FA council member and the chairman of Chelsea football club, it used its lottery grant of \u00a3120m to pay Wembley plc \u00a3103m for the buildings and the land. The transfer of ownership was confirmed in March 1999, and four months later the new company unveiled the initial design, a joint project by Lord Foster, one of Britain's leading architects, with HOK+Lobb, a partnership formed by the recent merger between a Kansas City company responsible for more than 50 stadiums in the US and a Brisbane company that worked on Huddersfield Town's McAlpine stadium and Bolton Wanderers' Reebok stadium, as well as Stadium Australia. </p> <p>The plans bore the imprint of Mr Bates's thinking in their inclusion of a hotel and office space, and of the high proportion of seats - 14,000 of a total of 90,000 - devoted to VIPs and corporate hospitality clients. This reflected the philosophy behind the Chelsea Village development at Stamford Bridge, where the football ground is surrounded by facilities intended to generate extra revenue from the site. On the basis of these additional features, the new Wembley company announced a projected annual profit of around \u00a330m, compared with the most recent figure of \u00a38.8m for the old stadium. </p> <p>In December last year a row broke out over the omission from the final plans of a running track, which had been part of the written agreement between the plc and Sport England. The terms under which the lottery money was granted ensured that the stadium would be able to stage major track and field events, meaning that the new Wembley would be the natural home for the 2003 world athletics championships, which had already been awarded to Britain, and would form the core element of a bid for the Olympic Games. </p> <p>While Chris Smith, the culture secretary, and Kate Hoey, the sports minister, belatedly tried to insist on the reinstatement of a track, it emerged that the FA had threatened to withdraw from the entire project if it were not given total control over the stadium's configuration. The argument rumbled on, and in the end Mr Bates agreed to forgo \u00a320m of the lottery funding in exchange for the right to exclude athletics. The \u00a320m, it was said, would be diverted to the building of an arena dedicated to athletics, at Picketts Lock in north London, with a capacity of 20,000, barely enough for the world championships and less than a third of the size required to back up an Olympic bid. </p> <p>There were also lengthy arguments about a payment to Brent council in recognition of the extra work required to bring roads and other public facilities into line with the new Wembley stadium. Brent wanted \u00a330m. Mr Bates offered \u00a31m. Eventually they compromised on \u00a317m. But the highways agency raised objections to the degree of congestion created by the new stadium, based on the number of events the stadium would hold. An amendment to the deal was eventually agreed, limiting Wembley to 30 sporting events and 12 concerts a year. </p> <p>The company had also run into unexpected difficulties in attracting bids for the building contract. Two months ago Construction News magazine reported that although several British companies, including Taylor Woodrow, McAlpine, Mowlem and HBG, had examined the project, none had submitted a bid. One senior manager of a company which declined to bid described Wembley National Stadium as \"the client from hell\". Among British companies, only Bovis had tendered, in partnership with an Australian company called Multiplex. When that joint deal collapsed, or was \"unilaterally terminated\", in WNS's words, the contract was awarded to Multiplex, which has been building Chelsea's new west stand for Mr Bates. </p> <p>This week news of the latest dispute emerged, this time over the stadium's car park. Required for use by Griffiths McGee, the winners of the \u00a310m demolition contract, it has been leased back to the old owners, allegedly due to a mistake by WNS's legal team. A high court judge is expected to rule before Christmas. </p> <p>The scale of the project has drawn criticism from those who think that a national stadium should be no more nor less than that. It has been suggested this week that there are influential figures within the FA who believe that the new Wembley should never have attempted to emulate the style of Mr Bates's Chelsea, with its four-star hotel, 54 flats, nine restaurants and a nightclub. It may be, too, that the fiasco of the Millennium Dome has curbed British financiers' appetite for big projects. But the biggest hindrance of all may have been the FA's humiliating failure to win the right to host the 2006 World Cup, which would have provided the project with a guaranteed future success against which to raise funds. </p> <p>\"You could build a Cardiff or a Twickenham,\" Mr Stubbs said, \"but this country deserves better than that. Any fool could build a Cardiff or a Twickenham.\" Those England fans still unconvinced by WNS's plans, and looking at the potential lengthening of the period in which their team are forced to play their home matches in club stadiums around the country, might just have settled for the fool's choice. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

A second message, advising on how to avoid breathing in depleted uranium dust, never reached its destination.</p> <p>Mr Spellar's admission is an embarrassment to the MoD, which is fighting claims by Gulf war veterans that they were poisoned by depleted uranium during the war.</p> <p>Veterans reacted angrily last night to the MoD statement. Shaun Rusling, of the National Gulf Veterans and Families Association, said he did not believe safety messages were ever sent to the Gulf.</p> <p>\"I think the MoD statement is untrue and is designed to cover up their failure to issue any warnings,\" he said. \"This is very disturbing. I would like to see their documentation as we can prove the MoD was fully aware of the dangers and yet did nothing to advise troops.\"</p> <p>The MoD statement came as new figures showed nearly 300 Gulf war veterans have died in the last three years. In a parliamentary reply, Mr Spellar said 278 Gulf war veterans have died since 1995. None of the dead has been officially confirmed as a victim of Gulf war syndrome.

      "bodyText": "Thousands of soldiers were placed at risk from the effects of depleted uranium, the substance linked to Gulf war syndrome, after a safety notice failed to reach troops in Saudi Arabia during the 1991 conflict. A breakdown in communications meant that the notice from the Ministry of Defence in London never found its way to soldiers attached to tanks armed with ammunition containing the fatal substance, the government said last night. In a written parliamentary reply, the defence minister, John Spellar, said officials had uncovered a message which was sent from the MoD to 1 Armoured Division in Saudi Arabia on 25 February 1991 about the dangers posed by the substance. A second message, advising on how to avoid breathing in depleted uranium dust, never reached its destination. Mr Spellar's admission is an embarrassment to the MoD, which is fighting claims by Gulf war veterans that they were poisoned by depleted uranium during the war. Veterans reacted angrily last night to the MoD statement. Shaun Rusling, of the National Gulf Veterans and Families Association, said he did not believe safety messages were ever sent to the Gulf. \"I think the MoD statement is untrue and is designed to cover up their failure to issue any warnings,\" he said. \"This is very disturbing. I would like to see their documentation as we can prove the MoD was fully aware of the dangers and yet did nothing to advise troops.\" The MoD statement came as new figures showed nearly 300 Gulf war veterans have died in the last three years. In a parliamentary reply, Mr Spellar said 278 Gulf war veterans have died since 1995. None of the dead has been officially confirmed as a victim of Gulf war syndrome. Fifty committed suicide. Stephen Childs, 47, who died of liver and pancreas cancer on Saturday, was the most recent Gulf war soldier to die. His doctor believes exposure to depleted uranium while he recovered damaged vehicles caused his illness. The MoD said last night that it regretted that its safety notice failed to reach troops. But a spokesman insisted that there was no proof that soldiers fell ill as a result of depleted uranium, which is used to strengthen the tips of shells. The spokesman said that the substance only posed a risk to Iraqi troops when it vapourised after piercing armour. \"We do not believe it is a problem for British veterans, but we have offered them tests. This has not been accepted.\" The veterans' campaign received a boost earlier this year after tests were carried out on the body of Terry Riordon, a Canadian military policeman who died after suffering Gulf war syndrome.

But he remains sharply focused on the tortured relationship between Britain and the EU. Tony Blair, he insisted, is not alone, with his Nice \"red lines\" on tax, social security, defence and borders, where he refuses to move to qualified majority voting (QMV). \"Everyone goes with their own agenda. Everyone has something they'll be battling for. \"The prime minister, unlike me, is elected, and the prime minister or any head of a government in the EU has to be able to carry public opinion.

By early evening he was flying into Teesside airport for dinner with Tony Blair at the smart County Bistro pub restaurant in the prime minister's Sedgefield constituency. Mr Blair set out his stall when he told Mr Chirac that Britain has a series of \"red lines\" on Europe that he will never cross.</p> <p>Speaking ahead of their dinner, Mr Blair said he would make it clear next week that Britain will retain its national veto in six key areas, including tax and social security. The national veto is one of the most sensitive areas of European reform. The prime minister said that Britain was prepared to abandon its veto in certain areas, in favour of qualified majority voting, to allow the enlargement of the union. Mr Chirac replied that France also had a red line which he would never cross, on French services and culture.</p> <p>Over a meal of shoulder of Northumbrian lamb, the two leaders spoke in friendly terms of their \"common purpose\" towards EU reform. Mr Blair outlined his thinking when he said that Europe must not lose sight of the importance of expanding the EU to the east. \"I would like to emphasise that the purpose of the summit is to prepare us for enlargement of the EU,\" he said. \"It is that process of enlargement, taking in the countries who want to join the EU, that is so important in the future.\"</p> <p>Mr Chirac said that Europe faced \"complex negotiations\" at the summit. But he said that Britain and France were agreed on the broad principles for Nice. \"With our British friends we share the same ambitions and the same goals and the same vision and that is what we are going to debate this evening in a friendly and peaceful manner.\" The two leaders later agreed to try to work together with the Americans to get the climate change talks back on track after the ignominious collapse of the negotiations last Saturday. Contacts are likely to be made with Washington over the weekend.</p> <p>The greatest competition over dinner in the village of Aycliffe came not over Europe but over the French language. The prime minister, who prides himself on the French that he learnt as a Paris barman in his student days, insisted on addressing his guest in French. Mr Chirac, a graduate of the elite ENA college in Paris who has impeccable English, was equally determined to demonstrate his command of the prime minister's tongue. Mr Chirac was on his way home last night after an \"enjoyable evening\". The president, who appreciates fine cuisine, just smiled when asked about the meal.</p> <p>Downing Street had, however, gone to great lengths to impress its guest. The County has been transformed into a trendy middle-England eatery by a pupil of Raymond Blanc, offering the kind of food - confit of pork, crispy duck, seafood stew - which would drive some villagers to the local chippy. \"We asked the chef for a menu with good British ingredients,\" said Downing Street. That included dressed crab (\u00a34.95), Northumbrian lamb and trimmings (\u00a313.45), and British cheeses (\u00a34.95) with a pudding thrown in for a fiver.</p>",

Mr Blair outlined his thinking when he said that Europe must not lose sight of the importance of expanding the EU to the east. \"I would like to emphasise that the purpose of the summit is to prepare us for enlargement of the EU,\" he said. \"It is that process of enlargement, taking in the countries who want to join the EU, that is so important in the future.\" Mr Chirac said that Europe faced \"complex negotiations\" at the summit. But he said that Britain and France were agreed on the broad principles for Nice. \"With our British friends we share the same ambitions and the same goals and the same vision and that is what we are going to debate this evening in a friendly and peaceful manner.\" The two leaders later agreed to try to work together with the Americans to get the climate change talks back on track after the ignominious collapse of the negotiations last Saturday. Contacts are likely to be made with Washington over the weekend. The greatest competition over dinner in the village of Aycliffe came not over Europe but over the French language. The prime minister, who prides himself on the French that he learnt as a Paris barman in his student days, insisted on addressing his guest in French. Mr Chirac, a graduate of the elite ENA college in Paris who has impeccable English, was equally determined to demonstrate his command of the prime minister's tongue. Mr Chirac was on his way home last night after an \"enjoyable evening\". The president, who appreciates fine cuisine, just smiled when asked about the meal. Downing Street had, however, gone to great lengths to impress its guest. The County has been transformed into a trendy middle-England eatery by a pupil of Raymond Blanc, offering the kind of food - confit of pork, crispy duck, seafood stew - which would drive some villagers to the local chippy. \"We asked the chef for a menu with good British ingredients,\" said Downing Street. That included dressed crab (\u00a34.95), Northumbrian lamb and trimmings (\u00a313.45), and British cheeses (\u00a34.95) with a pudding thrown in for a fiver.",

      "bodyText": "A new breed of young criminals, many as young as 10, are committing street robberies because they believe it will give them credibility and status in neighbourhoods they regard as \"lawless\", Scotland Yard said yesterday. Sir John Stevens, commissioner of the Metropolitan police, said a recent rise in robberies around London reflected \"a new phenomenon\" - playground bullies taking their intimidation and menace outside school. Many of the offenders targeted pupils they knew and put pressure on the victims not to come forward for fear of reprisals. Although the Met recognises little research has been done in this field, it believes there is enough anecdotal evidence from officers on the beat, as well as worrying statistics from selected boroughs, to conclude a trend is emerging. Sir John's remarks yesterday had particular resonance because the killers of Damilola Taylor, the 10-year-old who bled to death in a south London council estate stairwell on Monday, are thought to be from his age group. Describing Damilola's death as \"shocking and tragic\", the commissioner said 40 officers were now working on the case full time and every back-up support was being offered. Referring to recent figures from the west London borough of Hounslow, Sir John said 70% of street robberies were committed by youths un der the age of 17. He said 72% of the victims were also under 17, and 40% of the offenders had never been in trouble with the police before, and were surprised they had been arrested. Commander Tim Godwin said some of the teenagers spoke of earning \u00a3300 a week from street crime. They stole pocket money, mobile phones, credit cards and Pokemon cards, he said. In one case a boy told officers how he stole money to give to his parents. But cash was not the sole or most important motive of those involved. Street crimes were often committed as a rite of passage by youths who were under pressure from their peers, Mr Godwin said. Sir John said: \"What we are witnessing is a new breed of criminal.

      "body": "<p>A lot of tired men are about to creep back into power in America. \"President\" Bush is a local Texas boy; for the big picture he relies on his father's people, in economics as much as in foreign policy. I met quite a few of these yesterday's men (almost all males) when they were out of office in the 1990s, passing the years of idleness at policy conferences on the virtues of private enterprise. They are an unimpressive lot.</p> <p>They didn't get the new e-economy, neither how it worked nor what its dangers were. When the rich in America were raking money in and the markets booming, Dad's people continued to harp on the need for tax cuts to stimulate investment. When the treasury secretary, Robert Rubin, began to pay down the national debt (with the help of Dad's one distinguished appointee to office, Alan Greenspan), they cried foul; Democrats are supposed to be reckless spenders.</p> <p>That businessmen, or business-minded people, are efficient and hard-headed in government is an outdated illusion. Compare Gordon Brown to the Conservative chancellors who came before him. He is infinitely more prudent and cunning - and tight-fisted, doling out goodies on social services only after the money had piled up in the Treasury kitty. You might not like the delay (I don't), but you understand it; a finance minister is meant to keep order rather than, like Norman Lamont, cry \"I am in pain!\" and reel from every economic blow.</p> <p>Brown's American counterpart, Robert Rubin, was every bit as prudent and tight-fisted - and as clever. Unlike his Republican predecessors, who frequently lost control of the business cycle while steadily piling up a huge national debt, Rubin had no single economic policy; he had lots of policies, for whatever the moment required. There were several moments in the last administration when the economy faced a downturn; Rubin helped prevent them by adroit fiscal manoeuvring.</p> <p>Why do conservative businessmen make bad politicians? Why, when they gain power, do they suddenly seem to lose their grasp of reality, clinging to simple nostrums like \"Cut taxes!\", bewildered by how to spend public money?</p> <p>I kept going to policy seminars with Republican-era businessmen because they were something of an enigma. Get them talking about how to sell soap or insurance and suddenly the years fell away, they were full of energy and interesting ideas; I've the same sense of energy listening to aged doyens of the CBI in Britain. But speak the words \"public\" or \"social\" and the metal shutters of the mind come clattering down, shutters on which the graffiti \"free market\" and \"lower taxes\" have been sprayed.</p> <p>The shuttered mind simply refuses to accept the positive side of the public economy. It cannot, in particular, accept the welfare state as a more efficient way to do the public's business, in medicine, transport, and housing, than ways based on selling soap. In the Reagan-Bush years, whenever these businessmen-politicians were confronted by unpalatable facts, they engaged in denial - or, in one egregious instance, tried to pretty-up unemployment figures by changing how the Department of Labour did its sums.</p> <p>Blinded by their own belief in the superiority of business, guided by simplistic cliches, public servants drawn from the private realm tend to be bad servants of the public. Yet with a wave of the fairy's electoral wand in Florida, Dad's tired men will become the global economy's new masters. Their reappearance is particularly chilling because global capitalism looks set for another hard landing.</p> <p>The big boom of the 1990s was largely fuelled by the technological revolution and a worldwide demand for consumer goods. Technology is now in a post-revolutionary phase and consumer demand is no longer pent up. In the States, both inflation and labour costs are rising. The bond markets have become credit averse and the stock markets are down, particularly the new-economy Nasdaq market. It is not a pretty picture, but it needn't spell disaster. The landing needs to be managed. For that, however, you need good managers. And good managers, in office, need to believe in government.</p> <p>British friends assure me that Thatcherism is dead - though at 10 Downing Street there seem surviving signs of it, if not at No 11. But the fact that the British and American economies have become so interlocked is the real issue.

      "bodyText": "A lot of tired men are about to creep back into power in America. \"President\" Bush is a local Texas boy; for the big picture he relies on his father's people, in economics as much as in foreign policy. I met quite a few of these yesterday's men (almost all males) when they were out of office in the 1990s, passing the years of idleness at policy conferences on the virtues of private enterprise. They are an unimpressive lot. They didn't get the new e-economy, neither how it worked nor what its dangers were. When the rich in America were raking money in and the markets booming, Dad's people continued to harp on the need for tax cuts to stimulate investment. When the treasury secretary, Robert Rubin, began to pay down the national debt (with the help of Dad's one distinguished appointee to office, Alan Greenspan), they cried foul; Democrats are supposed to be reckless spenders. That businessmen, or business-minded people, are efficient and hard-headed in government is an outdated illusion. Compare Gordon Brown to the Conservative chancellors who came before him. He is infinitely more prudent and cunning - and tight-fisted, doling out goodies on social services only after the money had piled up in the Treasury kitty. You might not like the delay (I don't), but you understand it; a finance minister is meant to keep order rather than, like Norman Lamont, cry \"I am in pain!\" and reel from every economic blow. Brown's American counterpart, Robert Rubin, was every bit as prudent and tight-fisted - and as clever. Unlike his Republican predecessors, who frequently lost control of the business cycle while steadily piling up a huge national debt, Rubin had no single economic policy; he had lots of policies, for whatever the moment required. There were several moments in the last administration when the economy faced a downturn; Rubin helped prevent them by adroit fiscal manoeuvring. Why do conservative businessmen make bad politicians? Why, when they gain power, do they suddenly seem to lose their grasp of reality, clinging to simple nostrums like \"Cut taxes!\", bewildered by how to spend public money? I kept going to policy seminars with Republican-era businessmen because they were something of an enigma. Get them talking about how to sell soap or insurance and suddenly the years fell away, they were full of energy and interesting ideas; I've the same sense of energy listening to aged doyens of the CBI in Britain. But speak the words \"public\" or \"social\" and the metal shutters of the mind come clattering down, shutters on which the graffiti \"free market\" and \"lower taxes\" have been sprayed. The shuttered mind simply refuses to accept the positive side of the public economy. It cannot, in particular, accept the welfare state as a more efficient way to do the public's business, in medicine, transport, and housing, than ways based on selling soap. In the Reagan-Bush years, whenever these businessmen-politicians were confronted by unpalatable facts, they engaged in denial - or, in one egregious instance, tried to pretty-up unemployment figures by changing how the Department of Labour did its sums. Blinded by their own belief in the superiority of business, guided by simplistic cliches, public servants drawn from the private realm tend to be bad servants of the public. Yet with a wave of the fairy's electoral wand in Florida, Dad's tired men will become the global economy's new masters. Their reappearance is particularly chilling because global capitalism looks set for another hard landing. The big boom of the 1990s was largely fuelled by the technological revolution and a worldwide demand for consumer goods. Technology is now in a post-revolutionary phase and consumer demand is no longer pent up. In the States, both inflation and labour costs are rising. The bond markets have become credit averse and the stock markets are down, particularly the new-economy Nasdaq market. It is not a pretty picture, but it needn't spell disaster. The landing needs to be managed. For that, however, you need good managers. And good managers, in office, need to believe in government. British friends assure me that Thatcherism is dead - though at 10 Downing Street there seem surviving signs of it, if not at No 11. But the fact that the British and American economies have become so interlocked is the real issue. During the big boom, British investment poured into America, as it did from the Netherlands and Germany; conversely, American management flowed into Europe. The return of these blind, tired men to Washington is therefore no foreign spectacle. As diplomats, they aim to \"coddle\" Europe less; but in their own country, as businessmen in government, their incompetence will soon enough become our problem.

You'll probably see the head count come down to the low to the mid-300s over the next two quarters.\" Mr Rose said the redundancies were part of an effort to reduce costs and move towards profitability earlier than planned. Financing arranged by investment bank Credit Suisse First Boston meant QXL now had \u00a380m cash, which should be enough to see it through to profit in 2003. Analysts said dealers had been unnerved by the widening second quarter losses that QXL had announced at the same time of the fundraising. Mr Rose was disappointed by the market's response, saying that financing issues had been addressed and expenses had been reduced by a third since the previous quarter. \"It's frustrating because we have exceeded all our business projections and are still in a high growth market,\" he said. In the three months to September 30, turnover climbed to \u00a35.9m from \u00a31.8m the previous quarter. Losses spiralled from \u00a315.5m to \u00a367.7m, largely owing to an accounting charge relating to the acquisition of German rival Ricardo.de. \"It's a decent quarter but not outstanding,\" said Peter Misek, e-commerce analyst at Chase H&amp;Q. \"They haven't blown away anyone's expectations.\" An increasing number of analysts doubt whether QXL can survive as an independent. They believe US-based Ebay is winning the race to dominate the European online auction market and fear that QXL's management team will find its time consumed by integrating a series of acquisitions rather than building the business. A new chief operating officer has been recruited to smooth the process. Mr Rose is about to embark on a charm offensive in the City aimed at improving QXL sentiment among investors and analysts.",

      "body": "<p>Professional punters who play in London's biggest stocks will take the information they need to make a turn from almost anywhere. </p> <p>Take <strong> Vodafone </strong> . As Britain's biggest, and in stock market terms most important company, its every move is watched by an army of dedicated City analysts. </p> <p>A rough guess puts the number of Vodafone watchers in the Square Mile at around 25, and as far as anyone knows there is only one house - stockbroking minnow Charles Stanley - that has a \"sell\" rating on the stock. So if a trader wants to get an edge in Vodafone they need to look outside the City, and a few of the more educated players were doing precisely that yesterday. </p> <p>It all started mid-morning as word spread that Sanford C Bernstein, the US asset manager, had issued a bearish note on Vodafone.

      "bodyText": "Professional punters who play in London's biggest stocks will take the information they need to make a turn from almost anywhere. Take Vodafone . As Britain's biggest, and in stock market terms most important company, its every move is watched by an army of dedicated City analysts. A rough guess puts the number of Vodafone watchers in the Square Mile at around 25, and as far as anyone knows there is only one house - stockbroking minnow Charles Stanley - that has a \"sell\" rating on the stock. So if a trader wants to get an edge in Vodafone they need to look outside the City, and a few of the more educated players were doing precisely that yesterday. It all started mid-morning as word spread that Sanford C Bernstein, the US asset manager, had issued a bearish note on Vodafone. Indeed, Bernstein had published a note giving Vodafone a \"sell\" recommendation and a down side target price of just 195p. In the note Bernstein said that while Vodafone clearly had the best assets and management team in the industry, competition would hit Vodafone more than investors expected, and more than the stock price reflected. This was enough to convince a few punters to go short in the hope that once leading institutions got hold of the note they, too, would sell - and for a while the scheme met with some success. Vodafone shares fell back to 236p, but rallied in the afternoon to close 4.75p lower at 241.25p. In fact the performance of Vodafone reflected that of the wider market.

      "body": "<p>You can still see descendants of the horses painted in the 18th century by George Stubbs at studs in Newmarket and around the world. You can even see the skeleton of one of his most famous equine subjects, the racehorse Eclipse - whose bloodline to this day is one of the most highly regarded in horseracing - at the National Racehorsing Museum. But even in this world with its emphasis on blood, inheritance and continuity, there is something extraordinary about the way a horse painter who died in 1806 and whose paintings were long regarded as decoration for billiard rooms in stately homes has established himself as one of the greatest ever British artists. </p> <p>Yesterday a Stubbs was sold at auction at Sotheby's for an astonishing \u00a32,753,500. The picture of a dappled-grey racehorse has always been recognised as a Stubbs, but pulses started to race after cleaning revealed an inscription identifying the horse as Euston, which was owned by his patron William Wildman. It is the third-highest sum ever paid for a Stubbs - the highest, undisclosed sum was paid a couple of years ago by the National Gallery for his masterpiece Whistlejacket. It offers confirmation that Stubbs (1724-1806) is up there with Turner, Constable and Gainsborough in the elite of British painting. </p> <p>The story of how Stubbs rose from minor specialist artist to auction house megastar involves an American millionaire, a Derby winner, and a contender for the Turner prize. It is a tale of horse flesh and art history, the turf and the auction room. It is a drama you can read in the figures kept by the Art Sales Index on Stubbs's prices from the 60s to today. </p> <p>Back in the 60s you could buy a Stubbs oil painting for a four-figure sum, or less: in 1960 a painting entitled Rainbow-Grey Hunter Standing on Banks of Wooded Stream fetched \u00a3500. It was in the 70s that the stakes were raised, but even in 1977 a Pointer in a Wooded Landscape sold for \u00a33,000 at Christie's. Then in the 80s the market turned upside down. All prices for art rose and have continued to rise, but still the Stubbs renaissance was exceptional. In 1987 came the first seven-figure sum, when his Baron de Robeck Riding a Bay Cob sold at Sotheby's in New York for \u00a31,349, 694. </p> <p>What changed? \"It's a relatively recent rise to fame,\" says Stephen Deuchar, director of Tate Britain. \"If you look back even to the 60s, Stubbs wasn't considered to be so important. The turning point was Basil Taylor's biography in 1971. He was the first person to look at sporting and animal art in a serious way.\" But he did more than champion Stubbs in print. \"He acted as an advisor to Paul Mellon.\" </p> <p>The name Paul Mellon has become inseparable from that of George Stubbs. Born in Pittsburgh in 1907, heir to the millionaire businessman and politician Andrew W Mellon, Paul Mellon - who died last year - dedicated his life to the arts and was the first president of the National Gallery in Washington, DC. He was a passionate anglophile, a charitable giver, and his monument is the Yale Centre for British Art in New Haven, Connecticut - after Tate Britain the foremost collection of British art in the world. </p> <p>But he was something else, too. He was one of the world's great connoisseurs of horse flesh. Mellon described himself in his autobiography, Reflec tions in a Silver Spoon, as \"an amateur in all phases of my life . . . an amateur scholar, an amateur horseman,\" but his record as an art collector and horse breeder suggests otherwise. \"In addition to owning Stubbs's greatest paintings,\" says artist and horse-racing fan Mark Wallinger, \"Paul Mellon also owned Mill Reef, who won the Derby and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and the Coronation Cup - he was one of the greatest horses ever.\" </p> <p>Stubbs's collectors are generally a breed apart; they are people who like horses as well as art. \"A friend of mine who owns a Stubbs is also a great aficionado of flat racing and gambling,\" says Christopher Woodward, director of the Holburne Museum in Bath. But it was Mellon who became the first serious collector of Stubbs to value him as a great artist rather than a sporting specialist. In 1984 the first-ever major exhibition of Stubbs was organised by Judy Egerton, another of Mellon's close advisers, at the Tate Gallery. Robert Hughes hailed it as manifesting \"the feeling, now spreading in England, that Stubbs is to be ranked with Turner and Constable in English painting.\" </p> <p>It helps that this recognition has been, if anything, stronger in America, still the centre of the art market. Mellon's bequests mean that the fullest collection of Stubbs in the world is at Yale. Meanwhile, in this country the National Gallery has acquired Whistlejacket, which ever since it went on loan to the museum in 1996 has been one of the most popular paintings in the gallery. Painted lifesize and with no fields, clouds or trainer in the background, his eyes bulging with animal energy, his flanks pulsing, rearing up in empty space, Whistlejacket dominates his world and exerts a powerful imaginative grip on ours. Just what is it about Stubbs that has made him so contemporary and exciting to modern eyes? </p> <p>It's not just a horse thing. It's an art thing. You only have to look at Whistlejacket to feel transfixed and perturbed in a rare way, and it's not just in this painting that the world of Stubbs feels odd, even surreal. It's not that he is simply comparable to Turner or Constable, but that in many ways he looks more modern than either. The way his horses are isolated from the world and just stand there in space, isolated animal souls, makes you think of Magritte's painting This is Not a Pipe with its cutting adrift of objects. </p> <p>Perhaps it is also the obsessive quality of this art that fascinates us, the fact that Stubbs dedicated himself totally to one kind of subject, as if nothing else existed. He was so serious about animals that he dissected horses to understand their anatomy, and the detail of the horse's physical structure laid bare in his Anatomy of the Horse (1766) is the most perfect ever recorded in art. He was commissioned by aristocrats to paint horses; he also painted monkeys, cheetahs, a lion attacking a horse, and at the edge of the action, holding a bridle or sitting in the saddle, he was obliged to paint people. </p> <p>His adoration of the tranquility, courage and beauty of the horse makes you think of the Houyhnhnms, the wise horses Gulliver meets after all the grotesque humanoids he encounters in Swift's Gulliver's Travels. Perhaps it is the British worship of animals that makes us love Stubbs. </p> <p>Yet his vision of the world is cold, cruel, as if he was looking at things almost too clearly. Stubbs is the only 18th-century artist to have had a sniff of the Turner prize. In 1995 Wallinger was shortlisted for a series of works focusing on the world of horse racing. Wallinger's most explicit tribute to Stubbs is a series of paintings of horses under the title Race, Class, Sex, which appeared in his Turner show and are now owned by Charles Saatchi. These are paintings of racehorses in a stud at Newmarket, and their connection to Stubbs, reveals Wallinger, is not just one of style. As well as being painted in the manner of Stubbs, three of the horses he painted are directly descended from one of Stubbs's subjects. </p> <p>\"I painted four racehorses down in Sheikh Mohammed's stud in Newmarket. Three of them, Darley Arabian, Byerley Turk and Godolphin, had a direct bloodline back to Eclipse, the greatest horse that Stubbs painted. That is still the greatest bloodline in racing.\" </p> <p>It's a strange bloodline that leads from the aristocrats who commissioned Stubbs to record their horses in the 18th century to the Turner prize. Some of the greatest Stubbs paintings are still owned by the families that commissioned them, and still hang in country houses where horses, hunting and gun dogs are around to provide context. </p> <p>The Grosvenor Hunt, exhibited at Christie's this year and still owned by the Grosvenor family in Cheshire, depicts gentlemen watching from their horses as a pack of black-and- white hounds bring down a stag in a stream under a tree in front of a grey sky. It's a chilling, unforgettable painting as the hunt just sit there and watch, their horses rebelling slightly, as the animal is torn to pieces. We look on, transfixed; wild horses couldn't drag us away.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Terry Venables was yesterday asked to make a \"lifestyle choice\" and decide whether he will spend his Saturday nights with Des Lynam or Bryan Robson next season. </p> <p>With no answer forthcoming on Middlesbrough's attempt to lure the former England coach to Teesside, both the club and ITV put Venables under intense pressure to make a final decision. </p> <p>Privately, the 57-year-old Venables has in principle accepted the struggling Premiership club's offer of a \u00a31.5m, 18-month contract to replace Robson as first-team manager. Given Venables' record, however, the Boro chairman Steve Gibson will not be holding his breath. </p> <p>Meanwhile, ITV is reluctantly preparing to lose its most high-profile pundit for the network's expanded football coverage next season. With the Boro post demanding full-time commitment, it would scupper ITV's plans to feature Venables alongside Lynam on the new Match of the Day-style highlights programme to be broadcast at 8pm on Saturdays. </p> <p>The network is willing to let Venables manage Boro and make midweek appearances on its Champions League programmes - as he did while manager of Crystal Palace in 1998 - until his television contract expires in the summer. </p> <p>As Robson took training yesterday in preparation for tomorrow's trip to West Ham, club officials stressed it was \"business as usual\". </p> <p>\"There is nothing fresh to report today regarding the negotiations with Terry Venables,\" said Robson. \"There is nothing more we can tell the fans at the moment. When there is something concrete we can say, we will say it.\" </p> <p>Venables' hesitation is in contrast to his reaction when he was linked with the post of England coach after the resignation of Kevin Keegan in October. No mention was made of business or media commitments which might preclude him from taking the post and, at the time, he declared he was \"starving\" to tackle a high-profile job in management. \"If you were asking me if I've lost the bite for it, I would say no,\" he said. \"I could live without being directly involved. But I want to be in and around it because I care about it.\" </p> <p>Gibson is believed to have promised Venables substantial transfer funds to steer the side, who have not had a Premiership win since September, away from the bottom three. </p> <p>Middlesbrough may have lost confidence in Robson but Gibson is reluctant to dismiss him, even hoping that he may return to the position he has held since 1994 once Venables' contract expires. </p> <p>The future of the coaching staff, Viv Anderson and Gordon McQueen, is unclear with Venables believed to be keen on bringing his former backroom staff at Portsmouth and Crystal Palace, Terry Fenwick, Ted Buxton and Dave Butler, to the Riverside. </p> <p>The uncertainty will not help the morale of Middlesbrough's players. \"We know as much as anyone else out there,\" said the midfielder Robbie Mustoe. </p> <p>\"We're just reading the papers and trying to find out what's happening like everyone else. We're getting no information whatsoever from within the club. It is frustrating for us at a difficult time.\" </p> <p>Robson disagreed: \"It's not a difficult situation for the players at all. There's been a lot of speculation about Terry Venables but it should not affect them. </p> <p>\"The lads are professional enough; they get paid to play football. It doesn't matter who is taking the coaching sessions, they just get on with their job and enjoy their football.

      "bodyText": "Terry Venables was yesterday asked to make a \"lifestyle choice\" and decide whether he will spend his Saturday nights with Des Lynam or Bryan Robson next season. With no answer forthcoming on Middlesbrough's attempt to lure the former England coach to Teesside, both the club and ITV put Venables under intense pressure to make a final decision. Privately, the 57-year-old Venables has in principle accepted the struggling Premiership club's offer of a \u00a31.5m, 18-month contract to replace Robson as first-team manager. Given Venables' record, however, the Boro chairman Steve Gibson will not be holding his breath. Meanwhile, ITV is reluctantly preparing to lose its most high-profile pundit for the network's expanded football coverage next season. With the Boro post demanding full-time commitment, it would scupper ITV's plans to feature Venables alongside Lynam on the new Match of the Day-style highlights programme to be broadcast at 8pm on Saturdays. The network is willing to let Venables manage Boro and make midweek appearances on its Champions League programmes - as he did while manager of Crystal Palace in 1998 - until his television contract expires in the summer. As Robson took training yesterday in preparation for tomorrow's trip to West Ham, club officials stressed it was \"business as usual\". \"There is nothing fresh to report today regarding the negotiations with Terry Venables,\" said Robson. \"There is nothing more we can tell the fans at the moment. When there is something concrete we can say, we will say it.\" Venables' hesitation is in contrast to his reaction when he was linked with the post of England coach after the resignation of Kevin Keegan in October. No mention was made of business or media commitments which might preclude him from taking the post and, at the time, he declared he was \"starving\" to tackle a high-profile job in management. \"If you were asking me if I've lost the bite for it, I would say no,\" he said. \"I could live without being directly involved. But I want to be in and around it because I care about it.\" Gibson is believed to have promised Venables substantial transfer funds to steer the side, who have not had a Premiership win since September, away from the bottom three. Middlesbrough may have lost confidence in Robson but Gibson is reluctant to dismiss him, even hoping that he may return to the position he has held since 1994 once Venables' contract expires. The future of the coaching staff, Viv Anderson and Gordon McQueen, is unclear with Venables believed to be keen on bringing his former backroom staff at Portsmouth and Crystal Palace, Terry Fenwick, Ted Buxton and Dave Butler, to the Riverside. The uncertainty will not help the morale of Middlesbrough's players. \"We know as much as anyone else out there,\" said the midfielder Robbie Mustoe. \"We're just reading the papers and trying to find out what's happening like everyone else. We're getting no information whatsoever from within the club. It is frustrating for us at a difficult time.\" Robson disagreed: \"It's not a difficult situation for the players at all. There's been a lot of speculation about Terry Venables but it should not affect them. \"The lads are professional enough; they get paid to play football. It doesn't matter who is taking the coaching sessions, they just get on with their job and enjoy their football. They have not had an interrupted build-up to the game. \"I don't know whether the lads are reading all the speculation in the newspapers or not, but the approach has been fine. It is up to them to concentrate on their job in hand, which is preparing for the game at the weekend, mentally as well as physically.\" \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

It has been obvious for well over a year that the new deal was working very well, a modest but solid success. Independent audits from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research showed that 164,000 young people who had been unemployed more than six months had all found jobs at least six months sooner than they would have done without help: the rest might have gone straight into jobs anyway. It cost an average \u00a34,000 per job and at that price the scheme just about pays for itself in saved benefits.</p> <p>At the height of the 1980s slump, half a million young people had no prospect of work - a lost generation, many of whom never recovered. Now there are only 37,000 long-term young unemployed left and the number is falling fast. Yesterday wasn't news - but imagine if the new deal had failed or if it had cost a great deal more per job. The dome would have paled into insignificance as an emblem of New Labour disaster. That's the trouble for governments - targets achieved, goals met, promises kept are dull. So yesterday ITN didn't mention the new deal result at all; the BBC gave it 10 seconds. Only failures are fun.</p> <p>In human terms, the new deal has lifted up thousands of young people: to be out of work with nothing to do for six months is a long time for a drifting 18-year-old. The magic ingredient is the personal adviser, a job now hotly competed for, with its satisfying results. The weary, depleted, old Employment Service has sprung into new life. Ninety per cent of new deal clients talk in glowing terms about their personal advisers, who see them right through even when they are in work.

One adviser swapped clothes with his client so he could send him off to an interview respectably dressed. He wore the boy's jeans and Man U T-shirt for the day; the boy got the job. If doubters want a taste of some real good this government has done, a session sitting in on new deal interviews is heart-warming stuff.</p> <p>But then come the stark reality checks: a dead boy in north Peckham is a shocking reminder of the wastelands still to be rescued, how many people, how difficult it is to change places left to fester for the past 20 years. Government spending so far has only nibbled round the edges; there is more to come, but little yet.</p> <p>The full force of what it really means to inherit a society where one in every three children is born poor is starting to sink in with Labour. Even the big increases in benefits for children don't fix all this quickly. Even if schools get better, many of these children will still end up at 18 with the new deal as their last resort. As years go by, these will increasingly be the hardest cases, for whom all else has failed. The later they are found, the larger the sums that need to be spent on treatment, counselling, intensive education, whatever it takes to get them on to their feet and into society.</p> <p>The new deal was allocated \u00a32.6bn over four years. It has spent only \u00a31bn, so there is money that should now be spent on high-intensity programmes for the toughest cases, old and young. It is cheaper than waiting for them to end up in prisons or mental hospitals. A target of getting 70% of single parents into work will be hard to hit while there are still very few affordable nurseries. Above all, to reach full employment the chancellor has to abandon one great ideological barricade and spend money where he swore he never would - on job creation in the most blighted areas where no amount of training magics up non-existent work.</p> <p>Nonetheless, hitting that new deal target is an important emblem of Labour success - and the starting pistol for the election campaign.

It will cost, they claim, \u00a31,000 less per job. Where will that cut fall? On education and training - the high-value part of the new deal. Never mind that many of these young people are illiterate and innumerate, private employment agencies will bundle them into jobs anyway. \"Employers don't want all this waste on training,\" said the Tory spokesperson.

Maybe he's a sleeping crocodile but it wouldn't be surprising if he really has had enough. Who could blame him for not facing another arid four years of opposition? Trying to oppose the new deal epitomises their problem. It is virtually impossible to oppose most of Labour's major programmes for schools, the NHS or the poor except with lies and the odd ideological privatisation devised for the sake of it. Rarely can politics have seemed more pointless than inside the Tory party now. The sterile search for anything different to say must be deathly toil.

      "bodyText": "The Indonesian government yesterday raised the stakes in its campaign against the growing separatist movement in the province of Irian Jaya as its people prepare for the 39th anniversary today of a unilateral declaration of independence. Ministers in Jakarta threatened treason charges against anyone raising the Papuan flag - the Morning Star - or repeating the 1961 declaration of independence of West Papua, as Indonesia's easternmost province is called by its people, and thousands of heavily-armed riot police and soldiers paraded through Irian Jaya's towns threatening to shoot troublemakers. The police also charged two leading members of the separatist movement's coordinating committee, the Papuan Presidium, with subversion. \"We cannot tolerate people demanding a separate state,\" said Brigadier General Sylvanus Wenas, the province's police chief. \"They know it is against the law as I have told them so myself and so we have to act. But we will treat them fairly as we would our own brothers.\" The presidium's chairman, Theys Eluay, its secretary-general Thaha Hamid, and a presidium member, Don Flassy, were arrested on Wednesday. All insist they have done nothing more than articulate the desires of most Papuans. Indonesia took over the territory from Holland in 1962 after promising a vote on self-determination. The referendum, which did not take place until 1969, was limited to 1,024 tribal chiefs, and has always been regarded as rigged. Since then there have been numerous military operations to crush the fledgling separatist movement in Indonesia's most resource-rich region. After taking heart from East Timor's successful struggle for independence, the West Papuan separatists began to make significant progress. In May, the Indonesian president, Abdurrahman Wahid, allowed them to fly the Morning Star, said he would recommend changing the province's name from Irian Jaya to Papua, promised autonomy and said that Jakarta would help pay for a Papuan people's congress. But the army, the nationalist vice-president, Megawati Sukarnoputri, and parliament blocked the changes. Last month the security forces started hauling down flags, parliament has refused to ratify the name change, the implementation of autonomy has been postponed until next May at the earliest and the congress has been declared subversive. Indonesia's chief security minister, Bambang Susilo Yudhoyono, insisted that the government would stop any attempts to break away from Jakarta but would continue to use a legal approach for as long as possible. \"If it becomes necessary, we will not be afraid to use repressive measures.\" However, there is mounting evidence that the government is already using force in many parts of the province to intimidate the separatists, who commands widespread support. Several battalions of special forces were deployed in recent months and thousands more reinforcements have arrived in the last few weeks. Earlier this year British-made Hawk jets were used to \"buzz\" towns in the rugged mountainous interior until the tactic attracted too much bad publicity. \"The authorities use the police in the towns but soldiers are deployed in the remote districts,\" said Julien Warringmo, a member of a student body that is monitoring the activities of both sides. \"People are certainly being blocked from travelling freely.

The two travelled to Harare in a last ditch effort to persuade Mr Mugabe to uphold the rule of law and make his land redistribution acceptable to the international community.

It is a rare occasion when two African leaders publicly criticise a fellow head of state. Mr Mugabe did not speak at the conference. Mr Obasanjo said the handling of Zimbabwe's land redistribution was important to the entire southern African region. \"The issue of land reform in Zimbabwe is an issue that is not only current but it affects almost everybody's life in this country and the lives of others beyond this country,\" he said. \"We do know that there is a law that stipulates what needs to be done and how it should be done so that this problem can be resolved.\" Mr Mugabe's \"fast track\" land seizures have broken his own Land Acquisition Act that was passed by parliament in early November. He has repeatedly assured international leaders that he is following legal procedures but his promises have been starkly contradicted by the numerous violent incidents in which white-owned farms have been overrun by veterans of the war against Rhodesian rule, often armed, and other supporters of Mr Mugabe. Five white farmers have been killed this year and scores more attacked. Thousands of black farm workers have also been beaten. Mr Mugabe has blatantly flouted orders from Zimbabwe's supreme court and high court to stop the illegal invasions. Instead, he and his cabinet have attacked the country's top judges as racists. Mr Obasanjo implicitly acknowledged that Mr Mugabe had not agreed to change his policies and that it was not currently possible to have fruitful negotiations with the international community to raise funds for land reform. The Nigerian leader offered his services as a mediator once Mr Mugabe is closer to the position of potential donors, specifically Britain. \"It takes two to tango,\" he said. \"When the British and Zimbabweans say 'yes, you can continue to mediate', we are available to act as mediators.\" A special envoy of the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, was also in Harare yesterday with a package of financial assistance for land reform that will be made available only if Mr Mugabe stops his land resettlement. Virtually everyone, including international donors and Zimbabwe's white farmers, agree that thorough land reform is needed to redress the historic injustices in which white British settlers seized vast tracts of African land without paying compensation. But all international parties agree that Mr Mugabe must follow the laws of his own country in acquiring the land and carry out the reform in a way that will improve the lives of the resettled farmers. Mr Mugabe has pursued his land seizures because he is convinced it is his best chance to keep a grip on support among rural blacks. He is already reviled by urban blacks who largely support the opposition Movement for Democratic Change. But Mr Mugabe's government badly needs cash, as it cannot pay for imports of adequate supplies of fuel or electricity.

Clare Brown, executive director of the infertility support network Child, said: \"Patients have waited years for infertility treatment to be given the recognition it deserves as an illness, the treatment of which should be funded by the NHS.\" A spokesman for Issue, the infertility support group, said: \"This comes at a particularly good time. Christmas is devastating for infertile couples who desperately want a baby.\" Useful links: www.nice.org.uk Nice www.nhs.uk/nhsplan NHS national plan www.doh.gov.uk Department of Health www.bma.org.uk BMA",

The vivid blue parrot is the last of its species living in the wild and has become an international cause celebre for conservationists.</p> <p>The Brazilian Institute for the Environment is launching a search of the region near Cura\u00e7a, 1,300 miles north of Rio de Janeiro, in an operation that has more in common with a police dragnet.</p> <p>Three groups, made up of researchers and local people, will track through miles of the semi-arid scrubland where the bird lives, handing out leaflets with photographs and interviewing everyone they pass. It is believed that a villager believes he spotted the bird a month ago.</p> <p>Yara de Melo Barros, the coordinator of the Permanent Committee for the Recovery of the Spix's macaw, said: \"It is important to find the macaw because it is the only one of the species that has knowledge about living in the wild. This knowledge is fundamental if we are ever to reintroduce others that have been raised in captivity,\"</p> <p>During the dry season it is usual for the bird to leave the tree it lives in for most the year. However, it has never been away for such a long time before.</p> <p>The academic infrastructure based around the parrot has the ultimate purpose of creating a community of Spix's macaws in the wild. Currently there are about 60 of the species in zoos and private aviaries around the world, mostly on other continents.</p> <p>Experiments over the last few years showed that the lone Spix's, a male, has the capacity to rear young. He formed a partnership with the more common Illiger's macaw and the couple raised baby Illiger's from eggs that were sneaked into the couple's nest.</p> <p>Next year, they plan to import five Spix's from the Philippines and introduce them into the wild with the hope they will procreate with the Brazilian male.</p> <p>Maria Iolita Bampy, of the Brazilian Instutute for the Environment, said the team was working on the theory that he was not gone for good but parrots are monogamous and part of the worry stems from the fact that the Spix's partner, the Illiger's macaw, has already returned to the tree they have shared for several years.</p> <p>\"We hope that he has just found another girlfriend,\" Ms Bampy said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The rarest bird in the world has disappeared from its perch in the north-east of Brazil, putting the future of its species in jeopardy. The Spix's macaw was last seen 56 days ago by a team of biologists who have spent ten years tracking its daily movements. The vivid blue parrot is the last of its species living in the wild and has become an international cause celebre for conservationists. The Brazilian Institute for the Environment is launching a search of the region near Cura\u00e7a, 1,300 miles north of Rio de Janeiro, in an operation that has more in common with a police dragnet. Three groups, made up of researchers and local people, will track through miles of the semi-arid scrubland where the bird lives, handing out leaflets with photographs and interviewing everyone they pass. It is believed that a villager believes he spotted the bird a month ago. Yara de Melo Barros, the coordinator of the Permanent Committee for the Recovery of the Spix's macaw, said: \"It is important to find the macaw because it is the only one of the species that has knowledge about living in the wild. This knowledge is fundamental if we are ever to reintroduce others that have been raised in captivity,\" During the dry season it is usual for the bird to leave the tree it lives in for most the year. However, it has never been away for such a long time before. The academic infrastructure based around the parrot has the ultimate purpose of creating a community of Spix's macaws in the wild. Currently there are about 60 of the species in zoos and private aviaries around the world, mostly on other continents. Experiments over the last few years showed that the lone Spix's, a male, has the capacity to rear young. He formed a partnership with the more common Illiger's macaw and the couple raised baby Illiger's from eggs that were sneaked into the couple's nest. Next year, they plan to import five Spix's from the Philippines and introduce them into the wild with the hope they will procreate with the Brazilian male. Maria Iolita Bampy, of the Brazilian Instutute for the Environment, said the team was working on the theory that he was not gone for good but parrots are monogamous and part of the worry stems from the fact that the Spix's partner, the Illiger's macaw, has already returned to the tree they have shared for several years. \"We hope that he has just found another girlfriend,\" Ms Bampy said.",

      "bodyText": "The widely anticipated consolidation of Europe's leading internet service providers took another step yesterday when the joint owners of LineOne confirmed that a buyer was being sought for the portal. BT's Openworld division and United News &amp; Media said the 50:50 joint venture \"no longer fits with either company's plans\", and that a new owner was being sought. Investment bank Merrill Lynch has sent out information to potential buyers; LineOne is said to have been valued at around \u00a3340m. Analysts believe LineOne - which has 1.4m registered users - is likely to be swallowed up by a leading European player seeking to increase its presence in the UK. Germany's T-Online, Spain's Terra Network, Italy's Tiscali and the UK's own Freeserve, which is in merger talks with France's Wanadoo, are seen as potential suitors. Analysts have long predicted that the dominant internet service providers in each domestic market would eventually swallow up smaller competitors. Tiscali is in the process of taking over World Online of Holland, while Terra has already bought its American competitor, Lycos. The sale of LineOne fits with United News &amp; Media's stated intention of exiting consumer publishing activities after the sale of the Express Newspapers group. It plans to concentrate on business-focused internet activities. BT, meanwhile, is seeking to sell its non-core assets to reduce a debt load of up to \u00a330bn, and has already said that the parent company will be split into four divisions. The valuation being placed upon LineOne is indicative of the declining stock market fortunes of the UK's internet companies. Earlier this year, LineOne shareholders were talking privately about floating the business for between \u00a31bn and \u00a31.5bn. However, a fall in value of internet service providers led by Freeserve has led to wrangling among the shareholders and management instability. In the past six months alone, LineOne has lost two chief executives as Ajay Chowdhury and then his successor, Andy Harwood, quit the firm. LineOne courted controversy in July when it decided to withdraw its unmetered net access service shortly after finding it was not viable.",

      "bodyText": "With television news helicopters fluttering in its wake, the convoy bearing 462,000 ballots from Palm Beach set off yesterday morning, accompanied by sheriff's officers, for its eight-hour drive into Tallahassee and the history books. To the US media, this was a repeat of the police pursuit of OJ Simpson even though the crimes being alleged by both sides this time are bloodless - so far. All that was needed to prolong this saga was for Cuban-Americans to hijack the van and ignite the votes. Anyone familiar with the novels of Floridian writer Carl Hiassen, which are packed with dodgy politicians and dark deeds in the alligator state, will be familiar with the scene and some of the characters who have emerged in Florida in the last three weeks. Here are the latest ingredients in this cross between a political thriller, a morality tale and a soap opera: \u0095 Ballots from Palm Beach and Miami-Dade, which number more than 1m in total, are due to arrive in Tallahassee by 5pm today. Circuit judge N Sanders Sauls had ordered that the ballots should be taken to the state capital so that they are instantly available if he orders a recount. The Gore team had asked for only 14,000 disputed ballots - the subject of a legal action that starts tomorrow - but the Bush camp asked for them all, a strategy which the Democrats say is mischievous and designed to delay and confuse. \u0095 In another action involving absentee ballots in Seminole county, the Bush team attempted to remove Nikki Clark, the judge hearing this case, on the grounds that her attempts to become an appeal court judge had twice been rebuffed by governor Jeb Bush, brother of George W. They failed. \u0095 State Republican politicians continued to move yesterday to set up a special session that would give Florida's 25 electoral college votes to Mr Bush, regardless of what the courts decide. Andrew's, around the corner from the supreme court, has been one of the chief watering-holes for lawyers, journalists and commentators in Tallahassee over the last few weeks. It offers a \"Jeb Burger\" for lunch, which it describes as a \"blackened\" burger served with mushrooms and cheese. Mr Bush said yesterday that he would be ready to sign a bill that would make his brother president, adding: \"I think people expect governors to say 'yea' or 'nay'.\" Such action, say his Democrat opponents, would indeed create a blackened Jeb Bush and they suggest they would have him for lunch if he went ahead. For the Gore camp, the lead character now in Tallahassee is undoubtedly David Boies, the lawyer who successfully took on Microsoft on behalf of the government. He has taken over the front-man role from the former secretary of state Warren Christopher and presents the reasonable face of the team in contrast to the more combative front men for the Bush camp, the other former secretary of state, James Baker, and the would-be vice-president, Dick Cheney. After the failed attempts to remove her, Judge Nikki Clark, 49, has now emerged as another lead character in the drama. A registered Democrat, she must decide whether to exclude from the count absentee ballots in Seminole county that were legitimised by Republicans who added missing voter identification numbers. This is seen as the case that could just change the result. If Judge Clark excludes the votes, Mr Gore would be in the lead - until the inevitable appeal. Not that the Seminole case is the only one arousing fresh attention. The National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People has announced plans to sue Florida over voting irregularities that prevented many black residents from casting their votes. So a governor with a burger named after him, a couple of feisty judges, a smart lawyer, a convoy and the whiff of racism. All that remains is a final twist in the plot.",

Mr Patten also predicted that the government would not succeed in stifling debate about the single currency until after the next elections and should enunciate \"broad principles\" beyond the five economic tests set out by the chancellor, Gordon Brown.</p> <p>He said he enjoyed \"civilised discussions\" with the shadow foreign secretary, Francis Maude, the chief spokesman for the \"superstate by stealth\" argument that dominates Conservative policy on the EU.</p> <p>But he added: \"People say of course we can be hostile to Britain joining the euro but positive about Europe. But they never are positive about Europe. And the debate is more and more about the little green men who live under the bed.\"</p> <p>Mr Patten said he sympathised with recent outbursts against the Eurosceptics. The prime minister was obliged to hit back, \"as John Major had to\".</p> <p>\"We can't go on getting the best for Britain without tackling these hysterical criticisms head on. They don't actually have the bottle to say, 'Okay, we think Britain should be out of the EU'. But that's implicit.\"</p> <p>Earlier, Romano Prodi, the president of the European commission, voiced the widely held fear that Nice may repeat the 1997 summit failure in Amsterdam to grasp the nettle of voting reform.</p> <p>He put the chances of success in Nice at no more than 50-50, warning that on \"the real hot potato\" of more majority voting, member states were deadlocked.</p> <p>But diplomats said Mr Prodi was deliberately lowering expectations of an outcome which will almost certainly be disappointing for the commission, but will probably include the minimal institutional changes needed for enlargement to proceed.</p> <p>The foreign secretary, Robin Cook, also sounded a cautionary note on the likelihood of substantial reform at Nice.</p> <p>He predicted that most of the proposals for specific moves towards majority voting would fail because \"one country or other objects to pretty well all that is currently on the presidency's shopping list\".</p> <p>The government has signalled readiness to move to majority voting on as many as 25 areas out of a total of 50 tabled by the French EU presidency up for consideration.</p> <p>But despite Eurosceptic claims that this represents a huge shift away from national sovereignty, majority voting already decides the vast bulk of EU policies: only about 73 treaty articles out of a total of 700 retain the right of national veto. More than 85% of EU decisions are taken by qualified majority each year, including single market issues, trade policy and agriculture.</p>",

All 15 EU members except Italy and Belgium have objections to removing the veto in some area. Mr Patten also predicted that the government would not succeed in stifling debate about the single currency until after the next elections and should enunciate \"broad principles\" beyond the five economic tests set out by the chancellor, Gordon Brown. He said he enjoyed \"civilised discussions\" with the shadow foreign secretary, Francis Maude, the chief spokesman for the \"superstate by stealth\" argument that dominates Conservative policy on the EU. But he added: \"People say of course we can be hostile to Britain joining the euro but positive about Europe. But they never are positive about Europe. And the debate is more and more about the little green men who live under the bed.\" Mr Patten said he sympathised with recent outbursts against the Eurosceptics. The prime minister was obliged to hit back, \"as John Major had to\". \"We can't go on getting the best for Britain without tackling these hysterical criticisms head on. They don't actually have the bottle to say, 'Okay, we think Britain should be out of the EU'. But that's implicit.\" Earlier, Romano Prodi, the president of the European commission, voiced the widely held fear that Nice may repeat the 1997 summit failure in Amsterdam to grasp the nettle of voting reform. He put the chances of success in Nice at no more than 50-50, warning that on \"the real hot potato\" of more majority voting, member states were deadlocked. But diplomats said Mr Prodi was deliberately lowering expectations of an outcome which will almost certainly be disappointing for the commission, but will probably include the minimal institutional changes needed for enlargement to proceed. The foreign secretary, Robin Cook, also sounded a cautionary note on the likelihood of substantial reform at Nice. He predicted that most of the proposals for specific moves towards majority voting would fail because \"one country or other objects to pretty well all that is currently on the presidency's shopping list\". The government has signalled readiness to move to majority voting on as many as 25 areas out of a total of 50 tabled by the French EU presidency up for consideration. But despite Eurosceptic claims that this represents a huge shift away from national sovereignty, majority voting already decides the vast bulk of EU policies: only about 73 treaty articles out of a total of 700 retain the right of national veto. More than 85% of EU decisions are taken by qualified majority each year, including single market issues, trade policy and agriculture.",

This put it in the four worst schools in England and Wales.</p> <p>The school is the first of 25 fresh start secondary and primary schools, nine of which joined the scheme this September, that are set to close.</p> <p>The National Union of Teachers last night demanded an apology from the council for imposing fresh start on the school against the wishes of staff.</p> <p>Today Estelle Morris, the school standards minister, will put pressure on local authorities to close schools that have been subject to \"special measures\" for two years or more, rather than resort to fresh start.</p> <p>David Blunkett, the education secretary, believes councils were given too much leeway to create fresh start schools and has ordered his officials to get the programme under control.</p> <p>Ms Morris will say: \"The government will not support proposals for fresh start schools in future where there is not a good chance of success. Fresh start ... is to be reserved only for the very hardest cases where closure is not an option.</p> <p>\"In each case there would be very clear targets and government support will be dependent on there being a real prospect of recovery. Normally a school should close if it consistently fails to raise standards for local pupils. Fresh start is about raising standards in the most challenging circumstances and it cannot be used to avoid local difficulties for schools that should close.\"</p> <p>Ms Morris will say the government's approach for turning around failure \"is clearly working in most schools\". She will say that 600 have been \"turned around\" since Labour took office and 122 have been closed.</p> <p>Telegraph Hill, in one of the poorest parts of the borough, has had major discipline problems, with some teachers complaining it had become impossible to run lessons. This year it had the 11th worst truancy rate in the country.</p> <p>Martin Powell-Davies, the Lewisham secretary of the NUT, said last night: \"Fresh start doesn't work. I think the council want the whole thing to go away now. I just hope they admit they are responsible.\"</p> <p>About a dozen of the Hatcham Wood staff, mostly junior teachers, were kept on at Telegraph Hill, and the school had an experimental curriculum.</p> <p>One teacher, who did not want to be named, said the school had opened without computers, photocopiers or a telephone system. Only 620 pupils had stayed at the school instead of the planned 750. The teacher said the school had no maths teachers last year and only one science teacher this year.</p> <p>Governors were told of Lewisham's decision last night. Althea Efunshile, director for lifelong learning and culture at Lewisham council, told the Guardian: \"There is a meeting at the school this evening. Until I have had the chance to talk to pupils and parents at the school tomorrow morning it is not fair to speculate about the future of the school.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The government will today attempt to shore up its flagship scheme for turning around failing schools, as a \"fresh start\" comprehensive announces it is to close. The scheme, under which poor-performing schools in England and Wales are relaunched under a new name with extra cash, has been dogged by controversy, including the resignation of four \"superheads\". But today the policy will hit a new low when the pupils and parents of Telegraph Hill, in Lewisham, south London, relaunched in September last year, will be told that the local education authority is abandoning efforts to keep it going. Formerly known as Hatcham Wood, its headteacher, Mike Davies, quit last term and only 3% of its GCSE candidates achieved five good passes. This put it in the four worst schools in England and Wales. The school is the first of 25 fresh start secondary and primary schools, nine of which joined the scheme this September, that are set to close. The National Union of Teachers last night demanded an apology from the council for imposing fresh start on the school against the wishes of staff. Today Estelle Morris, the school standards minister, will put pressure on local authorities to close schools that have been subject to \"special measures\" for two years or more, rather than resort to fresh start. David Blunkett, the education secretary, believes councils were given too much leeway to create fresh start schools and has ordered his officials to get the programme under control. Ms Morris will say: \"The government will not support proposals for fresh start schools in future where there is not a good chance of success. Fresh start ... is to be reserved only for the very hardest cases where closure is not an option. \"In each case there would be very clear targets and government support will be dependent on there being a real prospect of recovery. Normally a school should close if it consistently fails to raise standards for local pupils. Fresh start is about raising standards in the most challenging circumstances and it cannot be used to avoid local difficulties for schools that should close.\" Ms Morris will say the government's approach for turning around failure \"is clearly working in most schools\". She will say that 600 have been \"turned around\" since Labour took office and 122 have been closed. Telegraph Hill, in one of the poorest parts of the borough, has had major discipline problems, with some teachers complaining it had become impossible to run lessons. This year it had the 11th worst truancy rate in the country. Martin Powell-Davies, the Lewisham secretary of the NUT, said last night: \"Fresh start doesn't work. I think the council want the whole thing to go away now. I just hope they admit they are responsible.\" About a dozen of the Hatcham Wood staff, mostly junior teachers, were kept on at Telegraph Hill, and the school had an experimental curriculum. One teacher, who did not want to be named, said the school had opened without computers, photocopiers or a telephone system. Only 620 pupils had stayed at the school instead of the planned 750. The teacher said the school had no maths teachers last year and only one science teacher this year. Governors were told of Lewisham's decision last night. Althea Efunshile, director for lifelong learning and culture at Lewisham council, told the Guardian: \"There is a meeting at the school this evening. Until I have had the chance to talk to pupils and parents at the school tomorrow morning it is not fair to speculate about the future of the school.\"",

      "body": "<p>If you accuse the bright young sparks in TV or ad agencies of being behind the times, they think you're accusing them of still liking Duran Duran or wearing the wrong sort of scarf (so last year). What's really out of date is their notion of what older people look like, do, talk about and want to see on TV, and the only surprising thing about the current fuss is that it's apparently taken a survey commissioned by the ITC and Age Concern to make them even dimly aware of it. For the over-50s are truly fed up with the way they are shown - or not shown - on television. </p> <p>We know, of course, that TV people rate themselves on how they impress other TV people, most of whom are under 40 or feel the need to pretend they are. (Jane Root, new controller of BBC2, and herself 43, is quoted as saying that all people think they're under 40, which is nonsense.) But the ads that support these programmes, you'd have thought, would be more concerned with the sheer marketing idiocy of aiming everything at the young - the young who, in any case, are much more likely to be out or bonking in front of the box than actually watching it. </p> <p>There are, after all, 19 million over-50s, who will outnumber the others in a few years' time, and already spend \u00a3145 billion a year. Half of them, maybe, are the penniless pensioners who appear on the news every single time \"pensions\" are mentioned, but the other half - with mortgages paid, children (with luck) off their hands - are free to spend money - more so than they've ever been - and they're not spending it on Ovaltine and corn plasters. </p> <p>I wouldn't be unkind enough to suggest that the programme-makers simply can't count, but I can't understand why, whenever they want to show the over-50s, they usually show the over-80s, preferably in an old folks' home or crouching over a single-bar fire in their mouldering bedroom slippers? Nobody make programmes for 10-year-olds on the assumption they're the same as 40-year-olds, after all, but it's the same age gap in either case. </p> <p>Why does the word \"grandmother\" instantly throw up a white-haired old thing who's either going goofy or rotting up her descendants' lives, instead of the harried, working, busy factotums that actually do the job - the ones who are running charities, starting pressure groups, gardening, working, and looking after their grandchildren half the time (one consequence of family break-up)? Or going on holidays - and no, I don't just mean cruises. I mean mountaineering expeditions, dog-sledding with Eskimos, camel trekking across the Australian outback - just three well-subscribed senior holidays. </p> <p>I am, I should maybe say, currently Agony Aunt for Saga magazine for the over-50s. People hearing this usually laugh till their gums bleed and then ask if I get questions about Zimmer frames and false-teeth fixative. When I mention the man who, at her request, wears his lover's nightdress when he goes to visit her (should he wear it in front of her sister?), or the ones who don't know how to handle the surges of desire brought on by aromatherapy, or the 70-year-old woman asking about reliable computer courses - she must have heard that the biggest users of email in the States are grans and grandchildren - they are amazed. Why? Because they haven't noticed - and TV hasn't helped them notice - that today's over-50s aren't like the parents and grandparents they remember. These are the kids of the swinging 60s, and they're not about to take up knitting and the inglenook. </p> <p>The people who are complaining most, according to the Age Concern survey, are the people in their 50s and 60s, most of whom don't want special golden-oldie programmes - they are mainstream, they just want to be let off things aimed only at the young. They are possibly bored with programmes that are entirely full of violence and swearing (\"If there's not a fuck or a fight in the first 10 minutes, I'm not interested,\" as one producer put it), or programmes aimed at the notional \"younger viewer\" who is thought to want everything jazzed up, jokey, instant - who wouldn't watch a first-class programme like Local Hero, it says here, without Adam Hart-Davis wearing that foul pink bicycle helmet, or switch on to anything unless the girl seems to be having an orgasm as she announces a programme about global warming or the NHS. </p> <p>Older women feel especially poorly treated by TV. They are mostly allowed on the box only if they're guyed up like Clarissa Dickson-Wright on her silly scooter, or preceded, like Victor Meldrew's wife, by 200-year-old tortoises and the grim little dirge of One Foot In The Grave. There are exceptions - there was Hetty Wainwright, we get occasional bouts of Claire Rayner, there are grown-up dramas like Sins and Middlemarch; but the idea of showing, say, a senior female presenter with her white hair superbly blow-dried like Michael Aspel would be unthinkable. </p> <p>All right, we all like to think that we're a bit younger than we are, but not ludicrously so, and certainly we prefer handsome to plain people. But those in their 60s, according to the survey, are choosier than their elders. They watch more television than they did - at the moment, but this may not continue. And how will TV fare if half its audience drops away?</p>",

      "bodyText": "If you accuse the bright young sparks in TV or ad agencies of being behind the times, they think you're accusing them of still liking Duran Duran or wearing the wrong sort of scarf (so last year). What's really out of date is their notion of what older people look like, do, talk about and want to see on TV, and the only surprising thing about the current fuss is that it's apparently taken a survey commissioned by the ITC and Age Concern to make them even dimly aware of it. For the over-50s are truly fed up with the way they are shown - or not shown - on television. We know, of course, that TV people rate themselves on how they impress other TV people, most of whom are under 40 or feel the need to pretend they are. (Jane Root, new controller of BBC2, and herself 43, is quoted as saying that all people think they're under 40, which is nonsense.) But the ads that support these programmes, you'd have thought, would be more concerned with the sheer marketing idiocy of aiming everything at the young - the young who, in any case, are much more likely to be out or bonking in front of the box than actually watching it. There are, after all, 19 million over-50s, who will outnumber the others in a few years' time, and already spend \u00a3145 billion a year. Half of them, maybe, are the penniless pensioners who appear on the news every single time \"pensions\" are mentioned, but the other half - with mortgages paid, children (with luck) off their hands - are free to spend money - more so than they've ever been - and they're not spending it on Ovaltine and corn plasters. I wouldn't be unkind enough to suggest that the programme-makers simply can't count, but I can't understand why, whenever they want to show the over-50s, they usually show the over-80s, preferably in an old folks' home or crouching over a single-bar fire in their mouldering bedroom slippers? Nobody make programmes for 10-year-olds on the assumption they're the same as 40-year-olds, after all, but it's the same age gap in either case. Why does the word \"grandmother\" instantly throw up a white-haired old thing who's either going goofy or rotting up her descendants' lives, instead of the harried, working, busy factotums that actually do the job - the ones who are running charities, starting pressure groups, gardening, working, and looking after their grandchildren half the time (one consequence of family break-up)? Or going on holidays - and no, I don't just mean cruises. I mean mountaineering expeditions, dog-sledding with Eskimos, camel trekking across the Australian outback - just three well-subscribed senior holidays. I am, I should maybe say, currently Agony Aunt for Saga magazine for the over-50s. People hearing this usually laugh till their gums bleed and then ask if I get questions about Zimmer frames and false-teeth fixative. When I mention the man who, at her request, wears his lover's nightdress when he goes to visit her (should he wear it in front of her sister?), or the ones who don't know how to handle the surges of desire brought on by aromatherapy, or the 70-year-old woman asking about reliable computer courses - she must have heard that the biggest users of email in the States are grans and grandchildren - they are amazed. Why? Because they haven't noticed - and TV hasn't helped them notice - that today's over-50s aren't like the parents and grandparents they remember. These are the kids of the swinging 60s, and they're not about to take up knitting and the inglenook. The people who are complaining most, according to the Age Concern survey, are the people in their 50s and 60s, most of whom don't want special golden-oldie programmes - they are mainstream, they just want to be let off things aimed only at the young. They are possibly bored with programmes that are entirely full of violence and swearing (\"If there's not a fuck or a fight in the first 10 minutes, I'm not interested,\" as one producer put it), or programmes aimed at the notional \"younger viewer\" who is thought to want everything jazzed up, jokey, instant - who wouldn't watch a first-class programme like Local Hero, it says here, without Adam Hart-Davis wearing that foul pink bicycle helmet, or switch on to anything unless the girl seems to be having an orgasm as she announces a programme about global warming or the NHS. Older women feel especially poorly treated by TV. They are mostly allowed on the box only if they're guyed up like Clarissa Dickson-Wright on her silly scooter, or preceded, like Victor Meldrew's wife, by 200-year-old tortoises and the grim little dirge of One Foot In The Grave. There are exceptions - there was Hetty Wainwright, we get occasional bouts of Claire Rayner, there are grown-up dramas like Sins and Middlemarch; but the idea of showing, say, a senior female presenter with her white hair superbly blow-dried like Michael Aspel would be unthinkable. All right, we all like to think that we're a bit younger than we are, but not ludicrously so, and certainly we prefer handsome to plain people. But those in their 60s, according to the survey, are choosier than their elders. They watch more television than they did - at the moment, but this may not continue. And how will TV fare if half its audience drops away?",

      "body": "<p>I have a problem with which many women and, I suspect, very few men, will empathise. I am a university lecturer and am normally quite assertive and able to hold my corner in disputes. However, occasionally during an argument, I find myself on the verge of tears with associated wobbly voice, runny nose and watery eyes. It is difficult for me to specify which sort of row brings this on but I think it usually involves a personal criticism of me or a feeling that I am being treated unfairly. In a professional environment, the effect of this tearfulness leaves me embarrassed and unable to pursue the argument. I can only imagine how the other party feels - anything from embarrassment to feeling manipulated or even contempt. Is there anybody who has mastered this problem? Is there anything I can do to prevent it - therapy, role play, conditioning, shock treatment or whatever?</p> <p><b> It's their sadistic streak</b></p> <p>There is a sadistic streak within academic life, maybe as a result of the public school background of many of the key players. I remember being bullied at a job interview for a lecturing post at which my doctoral work was unfairly trashed and I still dream of revenge. I see no reason why the ordinary cut and thrust (note the language) of academic debate should not happen in a respectful climate. However, it sounds like you might need better survival skills. There is nothing wrong in getting good professional help. A counsellor would help - get advice from your institution's student counselling service. Is there any relevant staff training available at your institution? Do you have a mentor? And remember it is the quality of your work with your students that truly matters. <br><b>William West, Manchester</b></p> <p><b> Think before you react</b><br></p> <p>You say that the feelings which upset you and prevent you from pursuing an appropriate argument seem to be associated with a sense of being criticised or unfairly treated. It may well be that it is this interpretation that is the cause of your difficulties.</p> <p>My own work suggests that a good way of getting out of the recurring pattern you describe is to cast doubt on your \"I'm being personally criticised/unfairly treated\" interpretation by practising thinking \"perhaps I'm not being criticised or unfairly treated\". This can free you to deal with it in either of two ways: firstly by putting your initial interpretation \"on hold\" (after all, your interpretation could be wrong!).

      "bodyText": "I have a problem with which many women and, I suspect, very few men, will empathise. I am a university lecturer and am normally quite assertive and able to hold my corner in disputes. However, occasionally during an argument, I find myself on the verge of tears with associated wobbly voice, runny nose and watery eyes. It is difficult for me to specify which sort of row brings this on but I think it usually involves a personal criticism of me or a feeling that I am being treated unfairly. In a professional environment, the effect of this tearfulness leaves me embarrassed and unable to pursue the argument. I can only imagine how the other party feels - anything from embarrassment to feeling manipulated or even contempt. Is there anybody who has mastered this problem? Is there anything I can do to prevent it - therapy, role play, conditioning, shock treatment or whatever? It's their sadistic streak There is a sadistic streak within academic life, maybe as a result of the public school background of many of the key players. I remember being bullied at a job interview for a lecturing post at which my doctoral work was unfairly trashed and I still dream of revenge. I see no reason why the ordinary cut and thrust (note the language) of academic debate should not happen in a respectful climate. However, it sounds like you might need better survival skills. There is nothing wrong in getting good professional help. A counsellor would help - get advice from your institution's student counselling service. Is there any relevant staff training available at your institution? Do you have a mentor? And remember it is the quality of your work with your students that truly matters. William West, Manchester Think before you react You say that the feelings which upset you and prevent you from pursuing an appropriate argument seem to be associated with a sense of being criticised or unfairly treated. It may well be that it is this interpretation that is the cause of your difficulties. My own work suggests that a good way of getting out of the recurring pattern you describe is to cast doubt on your \"I'm being personally criticised/unfairly treated\" interpretation by practising thinking \"perhaps I'm not being criticised or unfairly treated\". This can free you to deal with it in either of two ways: firstly by putting your initial interpretation \"on hold\" (after all, your interpretation could be wrong!). This will enable you to take what is being said at face value, as information to be explored with the other person, eg, \"When you said X, did you mean... ?\" And secondly by checking publicly with the other person whether your initial interpretation was correct, as follows: \"I felt criticised when you said X... did you mean it that way?/I feel unfairly treated because (give reasons)... do you see it that way?\" This will enable you to respond to what the other person really thinks. Your feelings can now be turned from an embarrassment to an asset. They can be used as a signal to yourself to move into the new routine. My experience is that it takes persistent practice to learn to question one's \"automatic\" interpretations and to use negative feelings to signal the need to do so. However, these are techniques one can practice in any situation in which negative feelings play a part.

Closer examination reveals this to be a delusion. Although marked like Old Spots, they are in fact long-haired pigs - returning migrants from New Zealand. Julian, the proprietor, explained their provenance - descendants of the livestock carried on wooden-walled naval vessels through the centuries of sail, turned loose and naturalised in the Antipodes; now back in the UK two centuries later. They are grazing pigs, as opposed to rooting pigs, which is the normal habit of all pig breeds native to these isles. But they also enjoy the windfall apples of late summer and autumn with the same appetite and enthusiasm that I recall our sheep did at the same stage of the year. \"They can smell like a cider factory if you're downwind of them,\" observed their owner. Which is another feature replicated by our flock, who would tuck into a trough of quartered cooking apples with little thought for the internal consequences of fermentation in the complicated digestive arrangements that are necessary to derive nourishment from grass.

Simplistic rhetoric about \"walk on by culture\", curfews and tagging is cheap. They would do well to look at their own part in the demonisation of children in inner-city areas and to consider the impact of their pronouncements on police and public attitudes. <br><strong>Alison Higgs</strong> <br>London </p> <p>\u0095 I am afraid your leader misses the point. Bullying is the issue that needs to be addressed, outside school as well as inside - and not only in deprived areas. My eight-year-old son goes to a posh, private school, a couple of miles from Damilola Taylor's school. Since September, my son, a white, middle-class, physically fit child, has been bullied at school. Like Damilola, he has come home asking me what \"gay\" means. </p> <p>The school may enforce an anti-bullying policy, but it cannot prevent what goes on outside the gates, especially on the way to and from school. Parents should be made to feel responsible and give a good example. Children should understand that there is nothing to be ashamed of - or potentially dangerous - in reporting anti-social behaviour. The ritual initiation that Damilola's headteacher refers to (\"bullying, name calling, every newcomer gets it\") is demeaning and should be stamped on. <br>Name and address supplied<br> </p> <p>\u0095 Damilola's murder cannot be separated from the insecurity and destruction wrought by five years of the biggest single regeneration budget project in the country. Politicians persist in giving money to urban regeneration programmes that are about buildings more than the people who live in an area. </p> <p>The Peckham Partnership SRB programme will spend at least \u00a3260m over seven years, \u00a3207m of that on housing. Of the \u00a312m devoted to education, only two projects are non-school based. One is the Peckham library, the other a sports/youth centre for 14 to 23-year-olds. </p> <p>The SRB project demolished nine community spaces; four new ones have been built, only one of which is easily available for general community use. One community centre has been improved and remains available; it is constantly booked. </p> <p>There was a community in Peckham but it has been torn apart in the interest of long-term improvement. Yes, it will be a better place to live in the end, but if that takes 10 to 15 years to achieve, and a community takes longer to rebuild than a house, how many children will have been lost? <br><strong>Pascale Vassie</strong> <br>London <br>Pascalev@aol.com </p> <p>\u0095 Your leader is right to say that we shouldn't jump to conclusions as a result of one tragedy in Peckham. The neighbourhood has one of the most active regeneration programmes in Britain, tackling poor housing conditions, jobs and crime. </p> <p>Improving the quality of life in areas like Peckham is a steady grind over a period of years, in which confidence in the area is gradually restored. It can be done, as success stories in equally difficult areas have shown. </p> <p>Peckham has already suffered a major setback. It certainly doesn't need either the media or politicians condemning those who are actively building a new future for and with its residents. <br><strong>John Perry</strong> <br>Director of policy, Chartered Institute of Housing <br>john.perry@cih.org</p> <p>\u2022 This column was amended on 14 January 2015 to remove personal details at the individual's request.<br></p>",

The school may enforce an anti-bullying policy, but it cannot prevent what goes on outside the gates, especially on the way to and from school. Parents should be made to feel responsible and give a good example. Children should understand that there is nothing to be ashamed of - or potentially dangerous - in reporting anti-social behaviour. The ritual initiation that Damilola's headteacher refers to (\"bullying, name calling, every newcomer gets it\") is demeaning and should be stamped on. Name and address supplied \u0095 Damilola's murder cannot be separated from the insecurity and destruction wrought by five years of the biggest single regeneration budget project in the country. Politicians persist in giving money to urban regeneration programmes that are about buildings more than the people who live in an area. The Peckham Partnership SRB programme will spend at least \u00a3260m over seven years, \u00a3207m of that on housing. Of the \u00a312m devoted to education, only two projects are non-school based. One is the Peckham library, the other a sports/youth centre for 14 to 23-year-olds. The SRB project demolished nine community spaces; four new ones have been built, only one of which is easily available for general community use. One community centre has been improved and remains available; it is constantly booked. There was a community in Peckham but it has been torn apart in the interest of long-term improvement. Yes, it will be a better place to live in the end, but if that takes 10 to 15 years to achieve, and a community takes longer to rebuild than a house, how many children will have been lost? Pascale Vassie London Pascalev@aol.com \u0095 Your leader is right to say that we shouldn't jump to conclusions as a result of one tragedy in Peckham. The neighbourhood has one of the most active regeneration programmes in Britain, tackling poor housing conditions, jobs and crime. Improving the quality of life in areas like Peckham is a steady grind over a period of years, in which confidence in the area is gradually restored. It can be done, as success stories in equally difficult areas have shown. Peckham has already suffered a major setback. It certainly doesn't need either the media or politicians condemning those who are actively building a new future for and with its residents.

      "body": "<p>In March 1953, after visiting Ingrid Bergman in Rome, the English author Rebecca West wrote to the Swedish movie star: \"You may love your husband very much, but you should face the fact that he has no talent. You have great talent and a great personality, and it is absurd that for the sake of your private emotions you should allow these gifts to be wasted. You will think me an odious woman. But when your husband has made two more films for you, you will remember this letter.\" </p> <p>Actually, West was mistaken on more than one count. The Italian director Roberto Rossellini would in fact make only one more feature film with his wife Ingrid Bergman - Journey to Italy - and that would bomb at the box office a year later. Yet now, 47 years later, Martin Scorsese says that Rossellini's 1953 film is \"genuinely great\" and \"one of the most honest portraits of a marriage ever put on film\". </p> <p>So who is right? West was convinced that Rossellini was, \"in fact, a cameraman who has worked his way up on a ladder of sheets and blankets.\" There is some truth in this. While he was never a cameraman, Rossellini was a gambler; a user of people who relied upon scams and unpaid debts to make his films; a sexual adventurer who dumped Bergman when his films failed and straitened circumstances forced her to leave Italy and return to Hollywood; an escape artist who, when he was quizzed by a lover about how he managed to manoeuvre himself between so many marriages, affairs and divorces, replied, \"I always keep a window open.\" </p> <p>But the \"man who knows nothing,\" as West put it, is also acknowledged as the father of Italian neo-realism, the director who introduced naturalism into world cinema in 1946 with his revolutionary film, Rome, Open City. Then, three years later, Rossellini again tried to change the way we look at films. This time - largely in his films made with Ingrid Bergman, such as Stromboli or Journey to Italy - his aim was to encourage the audience to understand and engage with his actors through an exploration with them of their surroundings on screen. This was in opposition to the more conventional Hollywood method of identifying with the characters on the screen. With Rossellini's way, he claimed, one watches \"with one's own eyes\". </p> <p>Maybe Rossellini was expecting too much from his audience, by demanding that they discover his films at the same time as his characters. Anyway, for whatever reason, audiences didn't bite, and all four of his films with Bergman flopped. He was forced to retire from the screen for the next four years until 1958. </p> <p>This interlude, however, replenished him. \"Few film-makers at this stage of their lives or careers were as adventurous or ambitious,\" notes Scorsese in the preface to a new book, Roberto Rossellini: Magician of the Real. Scorsese adds, \"Rossellini's goal was nothing less than to educate the entire world.\" The method he chose was TV, which he regarded as an overlooked \"educational tool\" for mass audiences and the means he applied was biopics or \"film histories\" of cultural heroes from Socrates, Christ and St Augustine through to Pascal, Alberti and Karl Marx, in a proposed film that was cut short by Rossellini's death from a heart attack in 1977. </p> <p>Rossellini's son Renzo, who collaborated with this father on many of his \"historical\" films, currently lives in Los Angeles. In halting English he explains his father's approach. \"It was impossible to make studio films in Italy towards the end of the war. There was no technical structure, so you had to invent some other way to create the film, to find the light, to find the camera, the film stock - everything.\" </p> <p>The solution for Rossellini Sr - who started setting up a film about the Nazi occupation of Rome barely a month after the Germans fled the city in June 1944 - was to become a street hustler. Constantly on the move, Rossellini sold his furniture, begged and borrowed for cameras, and stole his light by running cables from a nearby betting shop to the offices of the US army newspaper Stars and Stripes, with the \"friendly complicity\" of someone who worked there. With no studios available, he was forced to shoot on the street, using real people in real settings rather than professionals against fake backdrops; and from this moment on, that would be the key to his films - in his words, he would be \"leaving things to their authenticity\". The way Open City was made immediately reverberated around the world. Suddenly everybody wanted to shoot on location. As Jean-Luc Godard confirmed a decade later: \"All roads lead to Rome, Open City.\" </p> <p>At the time, however, Rossellini's acclaim did not last long. Indeed, abuse was soon raining down on the innovative director from all sides - first from Italian communists, who were outraged by the ending of Rossellini's first film with Ingrid Bergman, where, as an estranged wife married to a \"primitive\" fisherman in Stromboli, she shouts in desperation, \"God, my God, help me!\" That, according to the Italian Communist party, was not the way to react to working-class poverty. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the rest of Italy despised the director for forsaking their favourite actress, Anna Magnani, the star of Rome, Open City, for Ingrid Bergman. Then, after he and Bergman began their affair in 1949, the Americans started in on \"the love pirate\", denouncing him - in the words of Edwin Johnson, a Colorado senator of Swedish ancestry - as \"a narcotics addict, a Nazi collaborator and black market operator\". And as if all that wasn't enough, neither was Bergman particularly happy with her director. </p> <p>David Forgacs, who has recently written a monograph on Open City for the BFI Classics series, says, \"After she split up with Rossellini, Bergman used to regale audiences in America with how difficult it was for her, a professional actress trained in Sweden and Hollywood, to work with the non-professionals Rossellini used in his films. </p> <p>\"When they were making Stromboli,\" reveals Forgacs, \"Rossellini would tie bits of string to the toes of the [real] fishermen and tug them when it was their turn to speak to Bergman. Otherwise they didn't know when to come in. Quite often you get these pauses as though somebody is holding up a cue card. You can almost see the joins in the movie.\" </p> <p>With Rossellini, however, there was always a distinctive method underlying any apparent madness. The same year he made Journey to Italy, Rossellini attacked the idea of pre-planned scripts in the style of Hitchcock. That was all right in Hollywood where films were made \"purely for entertainment\". For \"realistic\" films, he insisted, inspiration and spontaneity were what mattered. \"An author writes a sentence or page, then crosses it out. A painter uses a red, then paints it out with a green. Why shouldn't I be able to cross things out too, to remake and replace film? This is why I don't think you can have a fixed script. If I thought you could, I'd think of myself as a scriptwriter. But I'm not a scriptwriter. I make films.\" </p> <p> Yet, in all kinds of other ways, Rossellini is the most fashionable director in world cinema. Certainly, he is one of the most influential. Truffaut's 1959 film, The 400 Blows, which kicked off the French new wave, is a homage to Rossellini's third neo-realist movie, Germany Year Zero; Federico Fellini, who started out as an assistant director to Rossellini, realised that with \"the maestro\" you could \"make a film with the same freedom, the same lightness of spirit with which you might draw or write,\" while Martin Scorsese reveals that, \"The Rise to Power of Louis XIV, which is as close as Rossellini ever got to the gangster genre, was definitely on my mind when I was making Goodfellas.\" </p> <p>Closer to home, his son Renzo, who has become a producer in his own right says, \"I looked to him like a master. He taught me everything.\" But maybe his qualities as both a father and a film-maker are summed up best by Renzo's half-sister, Isabella Rossellini, when she said, \"As a little child, I thought he was God. Then, as I got older, I had to come down a little bit and say he was a genius.\" </p> <p>\u0095 The Roberto Rossellini season runs from December 2-16 at London's NFT (tickets: 020 7928 3232). A season of Rossellini's history films is at Tate Modern from December 1 to 10, and a one-day symposium on Rossellini will take place at the Tate Modern on December 9 (details: 020 7887 8008).

Historically in cinema there are some great film-makers who come from edit suites, from seeing how things cut together and how the significance of a scene or sequence can be changed depending on how you edit it. <br> </p> <p> <strong> How did you make the transition into directing commercials?</strong> <br> </p> <p> The company I was working for occasionally asked us to create little graphics or things like that between trailers, and then I remember trying to convince them to let us shoot little interesting things instead. I just lived for that, really. I cut trailers knowing that a few weeks later I would have a fantastic opportunity to shoot four seconds of film. That was worth getting out of bed for. </p> <p>And then I started getting a bit more confidence and I went to see a commercials producer. I showed him my stuff and he obviously didn't rate very much of it. But the advice he gave me was to go and try to shoot something I absolutely believed in. And when you witness all the work that's out there, you think - how can I compete? And of course you can compete simply with ideas. It took me a while to learn that. <br> </p> <p> <strong> What was that first personal film?</strong> <br> </p> <p> It was a little short called Mad. I saw it the other day. It's pretty dreadful, looking back on it. It was a two-minute piece and it was very simple. I got it made with an actor that I knew, with friends as crew, and put it together on a Sunday. I did what everybody has to do, where you are directing your film and making the sandwiches and everything else just to try and cut through. It was an odd little thing about some dementia or something. Not too cheerful. <br> </p> <p> <strong> What was your first commercial assignment then?</strong> <br> </p> <p> I met a producer who asked me to do a corporate video for a caravan park in Northampton. This businessman was selling caravans to OAPs: basically persuading them to use their nest egg and come and live in this community. He wanted me to make it look like Barbados - it looked like a muddy field. So that was my first experience of manipulation. But the first actual advert I got was for Kodak. Which I sort of felt was a good thing to do at the time. <br> </p> <p> <strong> Do you feel more a sense of liberty when you're making a pop video, compared to commercials?</strong> <br> </p> <p> Yes, I would say so. Again it depends. If you're making a music video for a boy band, you know, or a manufactured sort of product band, then the record company is going to be all over the director. It's would be the equivalent of making, say, a Persil commercial - where they're saying, you know, light the packet from this angle, because our demographic tells us that if you light it from side or top or whatever, then we will sell. But I think at the other end of it, the best way to do it is with a great band who have got no commercial pressures at all and you can go and mess about with a digital video camera and do something extraordinary. It's the most liberating experience I've ever had. Because it is just you and the artist. <br> </p> <p> <strong> Your surfer commercial for Guinness has been voted the favourite of all time. Where did the concept originate?</strong> <br> </p> <p> It originated with the advertising agency. They came to me with a concept. They'd just won the account for Guinness, which is, I suppose in advertising terms, a famous account. Guinness like doing unusual work, so it's a good one to work on. I remember we had a casting thing that said nobody in this commercial can be under the age of 25 or over the age of 35. And we ended up casting somebody who was 62 as the lead. You have to sort of sneak around the back and cast people who you know are right. And pretend that they're 35 years old. You have to play those little games to get the people you want. And slowly, slowly, they begin to trust you. <br> </p> <p> <strong> Obviously the music is very important. Was that there at the beginning?</strong> <br> </p> <p> We were looking for a track for it, and we found one we liked because it was percussive and simple. We also found a BBC2 recording from about 1956 of Richard Burton reading Under Milk Wood. And the serendipity of the sound track on the images was incredible. And then, unfortunately, the client said nobody will get it. But you've got Dylan Thomas, Richard Burton and Guinness - I mean, it doesn't get any better than that. And he didn't see it, you know? So we kind of wrote our own version of Moby Dick. But I still mourn the loss of that one because that was an amazing find. <br> </p> <p> <strong> I heard you spent ages looking for the right character.</strong> <br> </p> <p> Yes, casting is the key, it's the most critical thing. If the casting is wrong, everything else is irrelevant. Everything around the actor, whether it's the set or the sky or the car or whatever it is, will look like crutches. They'll look like they're trying to support something. It's like a house on quicksand. </p> <p>I'll chase the right guy. I mean in the Swimmer [Guinness] ad, there's a guy in there who I chased around a harbour in Italy. The day before the shoot, I still hadn't cast. We saw this guy walking around the harbour with his friends - and there was the man we'd been looking for for months. He was a fisherman and we said you've simply got to do this thing. I said to him, you'll save my life if you do this - you have to do it. <br> </p> <p> <strong> There seems to be a real significant climate change at the moment - a crossover between commercials directors and feature film directors. </strong> <br> </p> <p> I think, at best, music videos and commercials can reinvigorate cinema to an extent. Steven Spielberg is using shutter angles that he would never have used had he not seen them in Air commercials. Gladiator and those big movies are using a sort of photographic style of hyper-realism which is very much coming from commercials - not even the most creative end of commercials. I think it is all merging. It is important to look at them as you're graduating from one thing to another. <br> </p> <p> <strong> Working on commercials, you have to make some compromises. Is there the same problem in feature films - you have to deal with compromises with the audience or people lending the money? </strong> </p> <p> Well, making the film was the hardest situation I have been in, certainly. A good one, you know, but very difficult, a lot of new lessons to learn. I'm used to having people around that I really want to work with, that I know and trust as well - you know that your back will be covered. On a feature it's different: the mentality is different, you can't know everybody, you can't have your crew around you in the way you are used to. </p> <p> <strong> What about in terms of story?</strong> </p> <p> I purposely chose something that is very character-led, and not visual, something that is very minimalistic and just based around three central characters, very dialogue-intensive. A lot of the stuff I have been sent has been visual and technique-orientated, but these two writers Louis Mellis and David Scinto are very special, I think, and they write in a way which just intoxicated me. But in terms of budget, my first feature is two and half Guinness ads. The first one, the Surfer, was a million pounds, which is obscene. The cinema version was a 100 seconds long. <br> </p> <p> <strong> Ten thousand per second.</strong></p> <p> Something like that. </p> <p> <strong> Can you explain how you came to do Sexy Beast?</strong> </p> <p> The film is very simply about a man who lives in Spain who is a retired bank robber and someone comes over to ask him back to London to do a job. No great shakes as a storyline at all. But it's a funny, black sort of character drama with Ben Kingsley and Ray Winstone and Ian McShane. </p> <p>And for me it was an important first step, because I thought I needed to learn how to work with actors. Louis and David are two theatre writers who have written a number of things, but the only thing that they had before that was made into a film was Gangster No 1. </p> <p>The writers actually found me, rather than me dig them out. We had a conversation about Gangster No 1 long before Sexy Beast, but the whole process unfortunately spun out of our control, and we ended up leaving the project. It has since been made, as you know. </p> <p> <strong> Was it nice to be given the chance to work with really big names, and to see how much collaboration comes out of just getting them to produce for you on camera?</strong> <br> </p> <p> Absolutely. I have never worked with actors like that before. I found it a very different ball game. The film is really a duel between the Ray Winstone and Ben Kingsley characters which goes on for probably two thirds of the running time. And they needed to understand those rhythms completely for me to have anything to shoot, because if they started improvising within a scene and went away from the script for a second, the scene would somehow fall to bits. All the brutality, all the tension, everything came from the words, and I was really just trying to construct an atmosphere around that. One line of dialogue and eight close-ups, it was that sort of discipline for me. I didn't want the camera to be anything other than architectural. </p> <p> <strong> Did you have a long rehearsal period to get those rhythms just right?</strong> </p> <p> I had nothing. Unfortunately, Ben Kingsley came two weeks late off a film he was shooting in Los Angeles. I got out of the car, the first day of my first film, and they said: \"Ben is not here, we are not going to shoot what you thought you were going to shoot.\" So everything was re-scheduled, there was pressure to recast - it was a very difficult first couple of weeks. The actors hadn't even met one another, but in a sense it kind of worked because Ben Kingsley comes into the film like an alien, like a kind of pollutant. Thankfully, though, they had learned their lines. </p> <p> \u0095 This is an edited extract of the Jonathan Glazer event, part of the onedotzero...reprise at the ICA, for which Guardian Unlimited is a media partner.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Leslie Felperin: You made TV trailers before commercials. What did you learn from that? Jonathan Glazer: I didn't want to go into film trailers at all. I had just been pounding the streets after I left poly for close to a year, not really getting very much opportunity. Then I was offered a job cutting film trailers. This involved sitting in a dark basement round a monitor and people would give you really shocking pieces of work - then you'd write a voiceover and cut it down and try and make a two-minute trailer out of it. Did it help you learn how to come to grips with narrative and how to hone it down into a really short form? Yes, they did want to give the emphasis of a story. Occasionally you would get ones that had absolutely no story to them, nothing. So we always had this one line that we would start with: \"Once in a while along comes a film that is beyond your wildest imagination\" - and then you would have just two minutes of shot with a bit of music. But there are disciplines involved. Obviously.

La Donna del Lago, based on Walter Scott's The Lady of the Lake, is just such a work.

In the early 1990s, long before the Spice Girls figured out that the words \"girl power\" could be an effective marketing tool, Hanna was a key player in the empowering riot grrrl movement. Fronting the band Bikini Kill, she scrawled \"slut\" across her belly and raged against the inequalities behind such a word.

Le Tigre's manifesto is encapsulated in Slideshow at Free University: it didn't sound like much on last year's debut album, but live, accompanied by images of protest marches, it's a stimulating piece of work. Over a hypnotic, gloopy groove, a man's voice intones: \"We favour the simple expression of the complex thought.\" </p> <p>The trio's music is correspondingly basic: a gritty garage-pop assault of scrawling guitar and pogo rhythms, against which gender, race and sexual politics are distilled into shout-along anthems, incomprehensibly but coruscatingly yelped by Hanna, attacking New York mayor Rudy Giuliani in My My Metrocard, the misogyny of film-maker John Cassavetes in What's Yr Take on Cassavetes, and the artists who contribute nothing to social change in The Empty. The results could be glib, but Le Tigre are too passionate, too committed for that to be the case. A new song about racism ends with the trio chanting the numbers from one to 41, the number of times the west African immigrant Amadou Diallo was shot by New York police. It's simple but brutally effective. </p> <p>\"The artists,\" continues the voice on Slideshow, \"wanted [their art] to be something to be involved in.\" And so Hanna and Fateman introduce each song with spirited rallying cries inspiring their audience to engage in politics, to fight against discrimination, be it on the internet, on the streets, in a joke or in a pop song. In return, the panting young ladies in the front rows take up an incessant chant: \"Kathleen, you rock.\" There's something disappointingly inane about their reaction - they almost deserve the Spice Girls instead. Then again, that might be the most brilliant thing about Le Tigre: they can be political without being po-faced; they can discuss weighty issues and be go-go dancing at the same time. They are serious and playful and the kind of role models every teenage girl needs. </p> <p> \u0095 Le Tigre play the 13th Note, Glasgow (0141-243 2177), tomorrow.</p>",

Robertson provides a commentary that is an enter taining mix of the portentous and the ironic, while Dawson's hands play all the characters as well as rockets, clouds, moon and so on. Dawson's hands would pass an audition for Rada without the rest of him attached, and part of the pleasure of this piece is watching his inventiveness and technical brilliance. </p> <p>Yet the 25-minute piece, more rewarding when seen in an intimate setting, is clearly only a filler to extend the evening to a standard West End length and allow for a profitable interval that lasts longer than the first half of the performance. Then it is down to the main event. Except that it never feels like a main event. Thunderbirds FAB is an affectionate, good-natured show with really funny moments, but it seems like the sort of thing you'd have caught in an arts centre 20 years ago. That's even allowing for Graham Johnston's nifty, low-key design and Jon Linstrum's clever lighting, which give the show a bit of a gloss. </p> <p>Otherwise this is basically a comedy of recognition and nostalgia that gets its laughs from Dawson's ability to recreate a marionette walk and the immobile features of Gerry Anderson's original creations, what with Lady Penelope as a guy in drag and Captain Scarlet a drag in red. </p> <p>It is all enjoyable enough, but who it is really for? The humour is surely too unsophisticated and the send-up too underplayed to really appeal to adults, while the five-year-old fans of the current TV reruns seem to take it deadly seriously and haven't heard of irony. If your hopes of getting Tracy Island for Christmas are doomed, a ticket to this is unlikely to bring solace. </p> <p>\u0095 Booking to January 21. Box office: 020 7316 4747.</p>",

      "bodyText": "After a nail-biting delay of the kind that International Rescue would surely never countenance, and just when it looked as if the mission might be aborted, Andrew Dawson and Gavin Robertson flew into the West End in another daring attempt to cash in on the current Thunderbirds revival. The duo's show began almost 20 years as a small-scale Scottish tour of obscure arts centres but quickly became a cult hit, and it has been in and out of the West End since 1989.
