Implausible though it may seem, the musical duo that has topped various European charts and represents the ultimate chill-out music for thousands of frazzled dancers at raves across France, are an exiled Bhutanese Buddhist monk, Lama Gyurme, and a blind, French classical pianist, Jean-Philippe Rykiel. </p> <p>In Glasgow as part of Billy Kelly's fifth far-reaching Big Big World festival, Lama Gyurme (officially a Tibetan master of music in Bhutan) sits in the lotus position, resplendent in saffron robes, near the altar of the spartan church that now forms part of a multi-purpose venue/cafe/ guesthouse. Eyes closed, he expels unfeasibly extended notes of Tibetan prayer song, with Rykiel adding the ambient synth wash and keyboard chimes that have propelled European post-ravers into a relaxed Nirvana and the duo's album, Rain of Blessings: Vajra Chants, into the charts. </p> <p>Gyurme's voice produces a kind of sonic hypnosis: his low-level growl, akin to the amazing Tuvan throatsingers, ricochets off the church walls in a continuous undulating wave. Only an off-microphone cough between 10-minute incantations indicates that Gyurme has had to breathe at all. Rykiel, who met Gyurme in his French monastery-in-exile after composing and arranging for Youssou N'Dour and Papa Wemba, injects sometimes superfluous aural garlands of birdsong and bell samples along with pattering keyboard trills. The overall sound veers dangerously close to Enya's elevator-ambient territory, until Rykiel unexpectedly breaks into sprightly semi-jazz breaks reminiscent of Herbie Hancock in electronic mode. </p> <p>But this was a quintessential Big Big World event, introducing genuinely inspirational artists to a surprisingly packed Glaswegian venue. Gyurme's low, resonant song chants were a wonder of control, waves of earthy yet spiritual sound, and one of the last songs, or mantras, sounded curiously like an ancient Scottish lament coming from somewhere we have never encountered yet recognisable as a universal music from the soul.

The reductiveness of dynamics and tempo in Crippled Symmetry suggests an aesthetic related to that of minimalists such as Steve Reich and Philip Glass.

There is repetition in Crippled Symmetry, such as a fractured loop made from the flute player's opening fragments of melody, but the texture as a whole is ceaselessly changing and the music is impossible to predict.

The Queen's Hall, at the northern end of Regent Street, is long gone - it was destroyed by German bombs in May 1941 - but the BBCSO is still very much with us. On Sunday it celebrated its 70th birthday in typical fashion, with two new works commissioned specially for the occasion, by Simon Bainbridge and Mark-Anthony Turnage; it also brought its Chorus to the party for Prokofiev's cantata Alexander Nevsky, in which Michelle DeYoung was the mezzo soloist. The concert was also Leonard Slatkin's first as the orchestra's chief conductor. </p> <p>It was the BBCSO that premiered Bainbridge's best known work, Ad Ora Incerta (1993), the settings of Primo Levi for which he won the Grawemeyer Award four years later. His new birthday tribute is very different from that grave and searching cycle. The five minutes of Scherzi seem very consciously designed as a teasing concert-opener, an overture that has little time to build up a real head of steam before it is all over. The busy, almost subterranean orchestral textures are cunningly stitched together - little rhythmic figures are interlaced and combined, accumulating momentum all the time - but the outcome is a shade predictable: a big, brassy climax cuts across all the activity and the piece dissipates its multi-layered energy in a single musical line that leaves an elusive impression. </p> <p>Turnage's piece, though, is unmistakably extrovert. Another Set To is a 15-minute trombone concerto, designed as a showcase for the phenomenal Christian Lindberg, and also an expansion of a 1993 brass piece called Set To, which Turnage felt cried out for further solo and orchestral elaboration. Lindberg certainly releases all that latent energy; his commitment and enjoyment of what he is playing are exhilarating. </p> <p>No technical challenge seems too great for him: he can rattle off fast runs that the textbooks will tell you are impossible on a trombone, float a lyrical phrase with the delicacy of a string player, impose himself on the orchestra magisterially. He is very much the centre of attention throughout the work, which explodes out of the bluesy summons in the opening bars, though the orchestral textures, with their cunning doublings and sharp-etched detail, are full of interest too. It's a very attractive and polished piece to herald Turnage's appointment as the BBCSO's associate composer for the next three years. </p> <p>Slatkin presented both premieres very lucidly, and between them accompanied Joshua Bell in Samuel Barber's 1939 Violin Concerto. Though the work's neo-romanticism was hardly cutting-edge modernism even when it was new, it wears well. Played as musically and poetically as it was by Bell, who seems incapable of producing a single phrase that is not perfectly poised, it becomes irresistible; for once even the final moto perpetuo had a musical as well as a bravura point. </p>",

Still, it is a measure of the startling speed of their rise that there's still an endearingly shambolic quality about them. For half an hour, the crowd were thrilled by the sight of roadies wandering listlessly around the empty stage; finally someone managed to play the introductory tape of Ennio Morricone's music from Once Upon a Time in the West. The band strolled onstage, plugged in and negotiated their way safely through Spies. But when frontman Chris Martin then sauntered over to his electronic piano to sing Trouble, the evening screeched to a halt. The instrument refused to emit any sound, even when Martin banged his head on the keys. They hastily rejigged the set-list, an apologetic Martin returning to his acoustic guitar while technicians crawled around in the wiring. </p> <p>Despite it all, Coldplay possess an elusive but unmistakable allure, and not only to the sizeable female contingent in the audience. While their album, Parachutes, radiates inward-looking aloofness, their live performance introduces some much-needed personal warmth, almost exclusively from Martin. Geezerish and remarkably chirpy for a man who sings such lugubrious songs, Martin banters matily with people in the front rows like a rockin' Jamie Oliver, and hams up his frontman role by making melodramatic dashes into the crowd to let people grab at his clothes and adore him. </p> <p>But when the music starts, the going gets serious. Sometimes lampooned as a baby Radiohead or as \"Jeff Buckley-lite\" (presumably on the strength of the vaguely Buckleyish tune, Shiver), Coldplay's moochy, autumnal songs hover perilously close to the student/bedsit bracket, but the band consistently lift their material with cunning arrangements and purposeful musicianship. Their best songs have a distinctive colour that sticks in the mind, whether it's the keening, trebly guitar that Jon Buckland sends gliding above Don't Panic, Martin's stately piano figure in Trouble, or Guy Berryman's bassline in Sparks. Almost everywhere, Will Champion's restless, hustling drum patterns give the music an urgency that its slow tempos and melancholy melodies might otherwise lack. </p> <p>Although they lobbed a couple of new songs into the mix, including the string-synth-powered In My Place, the Coldplay repertoire is still fairly narrow, and the big question is which way they will jump next. Yellow, needless to say, was the crowd-pleasing highlight of the evening. A couple more like that could find the foursome leaping up the US pop chart. </p>",

Not quite in the same way as poor Philomela, her voice silenced by the brother-in-law who rapes her and rips out her tongue so that she cannot tell of his crimes. No: what renders you silent in Joanna Laurens's impressive debut is the audacity of the language, the way she says the unsayable about men and women, love and lust, the pain of being an outsider; the way she tells the tale to its wretched, vengeful, beautiful end without flinching. Afterwards, words have been quite choked out of you. </p> <p>Laurens's play makes Ted Hughes's Tales From Ovid look whimsical and the Royal Shakespeare Company's recent attempt to stage the story seem hopelessly prissy. She takes her cue from Sophocles's lost play, and makes some adjustments to more familiar versions of the story. Tereus's rape and mutilation of Philomela springs not just from tyranny and lust but from the incoherence of love. He has been made, by the clumsy machinations of Philomela and Procne's father exerting his own warped power, to marry the wrong sister. </p> <p>\"What's in a name?\" asks Juliet in Shakespeare's play about love. Tereus - older, wiser - knows that there is much. \"Procne. A clumsyknock name to my Philomela. Procne. Your name limps,\" he says on learning that he must wed and bed her. Laurens offers no excuses here, but in every distorting word she charts the psychological malformations of Tereus's mind. There are other wonderful touches: the intimacy of the sisters is depicted by a shared language that is delicate, joyous, and so private it is almost autistic. When Procne finds herself alone and unloved in Thrace she sounds foreign. Her young son Itys never gets the chance to speak. The weakest is always sacrificed. </p> <p>Laurens writes with such murderous beauty that you are put in mind of the work of the late Sarah Kane. Here she matches story and language so that the mutations and mutilations of one are always reflected in the other. </p> <p>There is a stark beauty in Rebecca Gatward's delicately judged production, which transforms the Gate into a tiny amphitheatre. The chorus perch on shelves like an inquisitive flock of birds, beadily watching the story as it rushes towards catastrophe. This is a quiet, emotionally branding piece of theatre, made all the more devastating by amazing performances from Alex McSweeny as Tereus, whose life and line is gutted, and Sharlene Whyte and Syan Blake as the sisters, whose story takes wing and soars. </p> <p> Until November 4. Box office: 020-7229 0706.</p>",

      "bodyText": "This is 95 minutes that will leave you speechless. Not quite in the same way as poor Philomela, her voice silenced by the brother-in-law who rapes her and rips out her tongue so that she cannot tell of his crimes. No: what renders you silent in Joanna Laurens's impressive debut is the audacity of the language, the way she says the unsayable about men and women, love and lust, the pain of being an outsider; the way she tells the tale to its wretched, vengeful, beautiful end without flinching. Afterwards, words have been quite choked out of you. Laurens's play makes Ted Hughes's Tales From Ovid look whimsical and the Royal Shakespeare Company's recent attempt to stage the story seem hopelessly prissy. She takes her cue from Sophocles's lost play, and makes some adjustments to more familiar versions of the story. Tereus's rape and mutilation of Philomela springs not just from tyranny and lust but from the incoherence of love. He has been made, by the clumsy machinations of Philomela and Procne's father exerting his own warped power, to marry the wrong sister. \"What's in a name?\" asks Juliet in Shakespeare's play about love. Tereus - older, wiser - knows that there is much. \"Procne. A clumsyknock name to my Philomela. Procne. Your name limps,\" he says on learning that he must wed and bed her. Laurens offers no excuses here, but in every distorting word she charts the psychological malformations of Tereus's mind. There are other wonderful touches: the intimacy of the sisters is depicted by a shared language that is delicate, joyous, and so private it is almost autistic. When Procne finds herself alone and unloved in Thrace she sounds foreign. Her young son Itys never gets the chance to speak. The weakest is always sacrificed. Laurens writes with such murderous beauty that you are put in mind of the work of the late Sarah Kane. Here she matches story and language so that the mutations and mutilations of one are always reflected in the other. There is a stark beauty in Rebecca Gatward's delicately judged production, which transforms the Gate into a tiny amphitheatre. The chorus perch on shelves like an inquisitive flock of birds, beadily watching the story as it rushes towards catastrophe. This is a quiet, emotionally branding piece of theatre, made all the more devastating by amazing performances from Alex McSweeny as Tereus, whose life and line is gutted, and Sharlene Whyte and Syan Blake as the sisters, whose story takes wing and soars. Until November 4. Box office: 020-7229 0706.",

He is more than just a computer buff, too. It is not mere bragging on United's part that the advertisement for his coaching programme on MUTV, The McClaren Formula, has a mock-up of Gianluca Vialli, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and David O'Leary watching it together on a couch, anxiety etched on their faces. McClaren, 39, has brought in a boxing instructor to help improve players' speed of movement and upper-body strength while on the training ground, where he is at his best, he preaches the shielding tactic used in basketball for blocking opponents at set-pieces. At home in Cheshire he has a mini-library about American coaches, particularly from basketball. The idea, he says, is to learn how someone like Phil Jackson, formerly of the Chicago Bulls and now the LA Lakers, continues to motivate players whose personal wealth runs into millions. There are inevitable comparisons, he believes, to be drawn with how United's players fail to let complacency creep into their games. \"Ultimately the coach's best friend is the bench,\" he has concluded, and he will often hand Michael Jordan videos to players such as Dwight Yorke and Andy Cole. As a player McClaren was a steady midfielder with Hull, Derby, Bristol City and Oxford. Brian Horton then made him player-coach at the Manor Ground before Jim Smith lured him to Derby where he helped build the team who, since he left, seem to be coming apart at the seams. The Sun ran the back-page headline 'Fergie names a Mr Who as No2' on the eve of his appointment. Everybody should know McClaren's name now. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "body": "<p>For the time being Arsenal will be content to stalk Manchester United with the dedication of gumshoes. What remains to be seen, when the pace hots up after Christmas, is whether Ars\u00e9ne Wenger's latest pursuit of the Premiership title is maintained in the spirit of Maigret or Clouseau. </p> <p>Already Arsenal are demonstrating that when it comes to winning matches with an economy of labour they are not far behind United. On Saturday morning, Sir Alex Ferguson saw off Leeds without using Ryan Giggs or Andy Cole. In the afternoon, Wenger won at Upton Park with Thierry Henry and Nwankwo Kanu employed only as late substitutes and even Ray Parlour, an important piston in the machine, left on the bench at the start. </p> <p>Wenger had less reason than Ferguson to save his players' legs since, unlike Manchester United, Arsenal are already through to the next phase of the Champions League and can use their remaining two first-round matches as practice games. Dennis Bergkamp's fear of flying, moreover, will ensure that the Dutchman, free of wearisome midweek trips, remains fresh for the weekend. </p> <p>Arsenal will be fortunate, however, if they continue to find opponents quite so obliging as West Ham were on Saturday. For most of the first half West Ham's defence, missing the injured Igor Stimac, did not exist as a recognisable entity.

      "bodyText": "For the time being Arsenal will be content to stalk Manchester United with the dedication of gumshoes. What remains to be seen, when the pace hots up after Christmas, is whether Ars\u00e9ne Wenger's latest pursuit of the Premiership title is maintained in the spirit of Maigret or Clouseau. Already Arsenal are demonstrating that when it comes to winning matches with an economy of labour they are not far behind United. On Saturday morning, Sir Alex Ferguson saw off Leeds without using Ryan Giggs or Andy Cole. In the afternoon, Wenger won at Upton Park with Thierry Henry and Nwankwo Kanu employed only as late substitutes and even Ray Parlour, an important piston in the machine, left on the bench at the start. Wenger had less reason than Ferguson to save his players' legs since, unlike Manchester United, Arsenal are already through to the next phase of the Champions League and can use their remaining two first-round matches as practice games. Dennis Bergkamp's fear of flying, moreover, will ensure that the Dutchman, free of wearisome midweek trips, remains fresh for the weekend. Arsenal will be fortunate, however, if they continue to find opponents quite so obliging as West Ham were on Saturday. For most of the first half West Ham's defence, missing the injured Igor Stimac, did not exist as a recognisable entity. A slipshod error by Trevor Sinclair allowed Robert Pires to score after 12 minutes and an own goal by Rio Ferdinand increased Arsenal's lead after 21. The rest was a familiar story of West Ham recovering their faculties sufficiently to get back into the contest after half-time and perform with enough vigour to convince themselves, their supporters and their manager that they deserved a point, even though the opposition had enough chances on the break to double their score. After the game Harry Redknapp made his usual speech, the one which starts with condemnation of the defence - \"You cannot give goals away like that at this level\" - but ends with a ringing assertion that things will get better - \"I'm still convinced that we'll finish in the top half of the table, nothing has changed my mind.\" Admirable though the West Ham manager's faith in his team may be, Redknapp is starting to sound like the three-wheeled waggoner who believes that around the next bend is a hidden cave where he can watch those Cherokees go galloping by. In fact his defenders rather pre-empted him on Saturday as they stood and watched while Silvinho, Pires, Sylvain Wiltord and Fredrik Ljungberg galloped by, spurred on by Bergkamp's arrows. When Frank Lampard and John Moncur eventually man aged to establish a base in midfield to back the skills of Joe Cole, whose qualities shone through West Ham's football like a search-light, some sort of parity was restored. Yet the omnipotence of Patrick Vieira - \"a giant from the first to last minute,\" according to Wenger - was not seriously challenged, while alongside him Gilles Grimandi again showed that he is more effective for Arsenal in midfield than ever he was at centre-back. Until a low free-kick from Stuart Pearce, struck left-footed from just beyond the right-hand corner of the penalty area, beat David Seaman through a crowd of players early in the second half, Upton Park had been resigned to blowing raspberries rather than bubbles. West Ham, after all, have still to win a league fixture at home this season and the natives are getting restless. Pearce's goal, however, roused West Ham to something approaching fervour and had Davor Suker, recently recovered from injury, been at his sharpest he might have brought the scores level 12 minutes from the end when a nod-down from Sinclair put the ball on to his favourite left foot.

      "body": "<p>Aston Villa continue to resemble the table dancing club that offers plenty of tease but precious little strip. Not for the first time, and doubtless not the last until John Gregory is given the wherewithal to sign the accomplished striker his side so desperately needs, Villa failed to capitalise on the midfield probings of Paul Merson. </p> <p>It all adds up to an overdose of frustration for Gregory who, after unexpectedly landing his dream job when appointed Villa manager almost three years ago, now harbours ambitions of taking them into the Champions League. After just nine games, profligacy in front of goal means they are already losing ground on the Premiership's top three. </p> <p>\"It was the same old story,\" Gregory said after watching his side fire yet another round of blanks. \"We had enough of the play but were unable to make it count. The same happened against Liverpool, Middlesbrough, Chelsea and Arsenal and the simple fact is we need a quality striker.\" </p> <p>Gregory expects to be given \u00a35m from the sale of Ugo Ehiogu to make a signing, but he is not sure that will be enough to recruit the player of quality he needs. \"I'm not going to buy for the sake of it,\" he said. \"I need to sign someone who will make a difference to our play and win us matches rather than fill a vacancy. </p> <p>\"I think my chairman, Doug Ellis, understands that, although I appreciate with the uncertainty over the transfer market we could pay \u00a310m tomorrow for a player who might be worth nothing in a couple of months' time.\" </p> <p>It must be galling for Gregory that Villa have invested \u00a312m plus to replace the old Trinity Road stand and increase the ground's capacity to 50,000. With just 27,000 present yesterday the construction, opposite the Doug Ellis stand, is in danger of being known as Deadly's Folly. </p> <p>Gregory spent most of the match perched on an unfinished part of it monitoring his team's progress, or lack of it. Alongside him stood his Sunderland counterpart Peter Reid, who was left similarly frustrated by his strikers' failure to make the most of their opportunities. </p> <p>Unlike Villa's strikers, however, the waywardness of Kevin Phillips and Niall Quinn was, as Gregory will testify, uncharacteristic. Beforehand the Villa manager had said the presence of both Phillips and Quinn in his squad would guarantee that coveted Champions League berth. Afterwards he was grateful for a collective off-day by the pair. </p> <p>Sound defensive work from Gareth Southgate and Co restricted Sunderland's chances, but when they did appear there were no takers. Phillips cracked a second-half shot against David James' crossbar and Quinn, set up after Michael Gray's left-wing cross had skidded off Southgate's head, toe-poked the ball wide. </p> <p>At least Kevin Kilbane did force James to make a save seconds after the interval when, put through by his fellow Irishman Quinn, he hit a right-foot shot that the Villa keeper kept out by diving to his right. </p> <p>Kilbane was a constant menace down the right flank and his display was consistent with his improved form this season. \"He's a lot fitter than when he first came here last March and he's causing teams a lot of problems,\" said Reid. </p> <p>\"Unfortunately our strikers did not - we were comfortable throughout and had the best chances but wasted them. I'm disappointed with our display in the last third of the pitch, although to come here and get a result is not a bad achievement.\" </p> <p>In contrast to James, Sunderland's Thomas Sorensen had just one save of note to make, a one-handed tip-over to an effort from distance on the stroke of half-time by Lee Hendrie. It all added up to the first goalless draw in this fixture for 110 years. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

After just nine games, profligacy in front of goal means they are already losing ground on the Premiership's top three. \"It was the same old story,\" Gregory said after watching his side fire yet another round of blanks. \"We had enough of the play but were unable to make it count. The same happened against Liverpool, Middlesbrough, Chelsea and Arsenal and the simple fact is we need a quality striker.\" Gregory expects to be given \u00a35m from the sale of Ugo Ehiogu to make a signing, but he is not sure that will be enough to recruit the player of quality he needs. \"I'm not going to buy for the sake of it,\" he said. \"I need to sign someone who will make a difference to our play and win us matches rather than fill a vacancy. \"I think my chairman, Doug Ellis, understands that, although I appreciate with the uncertainty over the transfer market we could pay \u00a310m tomorrow for a player who might be worth nothing in a couple of months' time.\" It must be galling for Gregory that Villa have invested \u00a312m plus to replace the old Trinity Road stand and increase the ground's capacity to 50,000. With just 27,000 present yesterday the construction, opposite the Doug Ellis stand, is in danger of being known as Deadly's Folly. Gregory spent most of the match perched on an unfinished part of it monitoring his team's progress, or lack of it. Alongside him stood his Sunderland counterpart Peter Reid, who was left similarly frustrated by his strikers' failure to make the most of their opportunities. Unlike Villa's strikers, however, the waywardness of Kevin Phillips and Niall Quinn was, as Gregory will testify, uncharacteristic. Beforehand the Villa manager had said the presence of both Phillips and Quinn in his squad would guarantee that coveted Champions League berth. Afterwards he was grateful for a collective off-day by the pair. Sound defensive work from Gareth Southgate and Co restricted Sunderland's chances, but when they did appear there were no takers. Phillips cracked a second-half shot against David James' crossbar and Quinn, set up after Michael Gray's left-wing cross had skidded off Southgate's head, toe-poked the ball wide. At least Kevin Kilbane did force James to make a save seconds after the interval when, put through by his fellow Irishman Quinn, he hit a right-foot shot that the Villa keeper kept out by diving to his right. Kilbane was a constant menace down the right flank and his display was consistent with his improved form this season. \"He's a lot fitter than when he first came here last March and he's causing teams a lot of problems,\" said Reid. \"Unfortunately our strikers did not - we were comfortable throughout and had the best chances but wasted them. I'm disappointed with our display in the last third of the pitch, although to come here and get a result is not a bad achievement.\" In contrast to James, Sunderland's Thomas Sorensen had just one save of note to make, a one-handed tip-over to an effort from distance on the stroke of half-time by Lee Hendrie. It all added up to the first goalless draw in this fixture for 110 years. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

But when Campbell, under pressure from Nolberto Solano, speared wide of an open goal it seemed the visitors' chance had gone. Cue Gascoigne's backheel and Nyarko's pass to the debutant Gary Naysmith, whose perfect cross was converted by Campbell at the far post. \"Gazza's still stuck to the roof and he won't be down for a while,\" said Everton's former Newcastle defender Steve Watson. \"He gets so hyped up before every game, but his attitude's fantastic and people buzz off him.\" Without a goal in three league games but with Robson staying in Toon, the home fans were just as satisfied. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

And yet still some of you pine for Terry Venables to return and lead England out of the international football wilderness.</p> <p>\"Why will they not give Venables the job?\" asks a bemused Louise Harvey. \"He has plenty of international footballing experience and he is tactically minded - and does anyone really care about his slightly dodgy past?\" </p> <p>Well the FA might have something to say about it, not that Louise is deterred. \"The England team has many world-class players (trust me, Northern Ireland could benefit from a few of them) but no sense of team spirit, unity, or tactics. This is what Venables could bring to the squad.\"</p> <p>And Mark Elliot agrees. \"El Tel was the best manager I have ever seen,\" he claims. \"As Aussie coach he bought soccer on to the front page by playing exciting and winning football. I don't think we ever lost a match. We just threw it away to Iran. But that was the only hiccup and it was not Venables's fault - the players fell apart in the last 15 minutes. The whole country was - for the first time ever - united as one, swept along by a whirlwind that was called El Tel.\" </p> <p>Elsewhere, there's a word of warning from Switzerland about Roy Hodgson. \"Living out here in Zurich one sometimes feels a little detached from the cut and thrust of English football,\" says Neville X, \"but if Roy Hodgson cracked under the pressure of managing his unsuccessful Grasshoppers team last season (with their massive 10,000 gates, the challenge of local derbies against the mighty FC Zurich and the media onslaught from Blick newspaper) then how on earth can he even begin to be considered for the national job? And by the way, what league are Blackburn in now?\"</p> <p><strong>Marvellous Maradona </strong></p> <p>Many of you have written in to praise Simon Kuper's piece on Diego Maradona. \"Your portrait of 'El Diego' is very human,\" says Jorge Argento. \"It's one of the few times that a journalist has seen the human side of Maradona and his circumstances, and not just the consequences of his behaviour.\" Luke Garry agrees, calling it \"a very moving article,\" while Tim Read, who has lived in Argentina for over ten years, says \"the piece captures Maradona's contradictions superbly.\"</p>",

Your help would make a sad middle-aged man very happy (and his 10-year-old son).\" If anyone can help email us at the usual address and we will pass the details on to Tim. Don't forget about Tel The FA have - according to reports - made a shortlist of three candidates (Arsene Wenger, Sven Goran Eriksson and Roy Hodgson) for the vacant England manager's job. And yet still some of you pine for Terry Venables to return and lead England out of the international football wilderness. \"Why will they not give Venables the job?\" asks a bemused Louise Harvey. \"He has plenty of international footballing experience and he is tactically minded - and does anyone really care about his slightly dodgy past?\" Well the FA might have something to say about it, not that Louise is deterred. \"The England team has many world-class players (trust me, Northern Ireland could benefit from a few of them) but no sense of team spirit, unity, or tactics. This is what Venables could bring to the squad.\" And Mark Elliot agrees. \"El Tel was the best manager I have ever seen,\" he claims. \"As Aussie coach he bought soccer on to the front page by playing exciting and winning football. I don't think we ever lost a match. We just threw it away to Iran. But that was the only hiccup and it was not Venables's fault - the players fell apart in the last 15 minutes. The whole country was - for the first time ever - united as one, swept along by a whirlwind that was called El Tel.\" Elsewhere, there's a word of warning from Switzerland about Roy Hodgson. \"Living out here in Zurich one sometimes feels a little detached from the cut and thrust of English football,\" says Neville X, \"but if Roy Hodgson cracked under the pressure of managing his unsuccessful Grasshoppers team last season (with their massive 10,000 gates, the challenge of local derbies against the mighty FC Zurich and the media onslaught from Blick newspaper) then how on earth can he even begin to be considered for the national job? And by the way, what league are Blackburn in now?\" Marvellous Maradona Many of you have written in to praise Simon Kuper's piece on Diego Maradona. \"Your portrait of 'El Diego' is very human,\" says Jorge Argento. \"It's one of the few times that a journalist has seen the human side of Maradona and his circumstances, and not just the consequences of his behaviour.\" Luke Garry agrees, calling it \"a very moving article,\" while Tim Read, who has lived in Argentina for over ten years, says \"the piece captures Maradona's contradictions superbly.\"",

      "body": "<p>Someone, day after day, is killing the children. We see them die, amid blood and grief. Yet in part, as we watch, we are killing them, too. That is the damnable thing about Ramallah and Nablus and Gaza.</p> <p>Consider our children, the children of Britain. They come wrapped, by public consent, in special status: they are minors, kids who aren't responsible and thus the ultimate responsibility of society itself. When their parents abuse or neglect them, they are taken away to a place of protection. The law adopts exceptional measures to hide their identities if they are involved - directly or indirectly - in crime. Schoolteachers can't raise a hand to them on pain of dismissal. Children come first.</p> <p>Press and television, in their own codes of conduct, echo that concern. No identification under the age of 18; no photographs or interviews without parental approval; no invasions of privacy. And not just for Euan Blair or Prince Harry Windsor. If children perish, as they perished at Dunblane, we do not want to see the bodies in the playground nor the parents, engulfed in emotion, talking unwillingly to a prying camera. These children are our children; and their tragedy is our tragedy. Children, in the purest sense, are innocents. Children come first.</p> <p>But on the West Bank or Gaza, children come first in a different way. They are the first to die - from the 12-year-old who died in his father's arms almost three weeks ago to 13-year-old Mohammed al-Najjar, shot in the head this weekend. Try to compute the victims of this latest uprising, this supposed war, and most of the 130 or so dead already are Palestinians - and, overwhelmingly, most of them are kids, teenage lads well short of their legal majority.</p> <p>Thus mothers sob and fathers choke before our eyes. Schoolteachers talk sadly about empty desks. Women pallbearers at the endless funerals chant that \"Israeli peace means killing the children\". Mourning crowds take up the refrain to these teenage \"martyrs\". \"Oh Arabs, pay attention - the Palestinians are getting killed.\"</p> <p>And here is the damnable thing. None of this is an accident, a happenstance, a contrivance of fate. The children are first in the firing line by design. They have become cannon and media fodder.</p> <p>Dr Stephen Males, a former assistant chief constable with a commission from Amnesty International, reported directly the other day on the course of the carnage. \"The key point is that Israel is using military tactics and not establishing policing practices.\" This means that the army - and, yes, thousands of young conscripts - is bent on winning a conflict of retribution and domination the way armies do. \"They are simply trying to wipe out or dominate the enemy\" - while police officers, who know all about crowd control, stand idly by.</p> <p>An appalling verdict, compendiously documented. Israel indicted. And the charge is not just sickening brutality, but imbecile strategy as well. For this, if it is war at all, has turned into a war for hearts and minds. \"One side waits for violence; the other side obligingly shoots them.\"</p> <p>The Palestinians, in turn, actively invite casualties. There's a \"ritual pattern\" to their demonstrations. Their police are not on hand to protect life or defuse tension. \"They make no attempt to stop children and youngsters let out of school for the day from running alongside,\" Males told Michael Binyon of the Times. \"There is a cynical allowance of the enormous risk to their lives.\"</p> <p>Why, you ask, such callous cynicism? Oh Arabs, pay attention. The Palestinians can't \"defeat\" the Israelis (if such a concept has any meaning) by throwing sticks or stones. They have no army worth the name. They cannot wage conventional warfare. What they can do, and are doing, is foment world repugnance. Sit down, in your comfortable western homes: turn on CNN or ITN or the BBC or any of the swelling range of cable channels - and be sickened.</p> <p>More specifically, fill the cable and satellite TV channels of the Middle East - like MBC or ANN - with this everlasting horror, and the leaders of Damascus or Cairo or Riyadh will feel the heat. The boys on their streets see the pictures; they know which side they are on. Can they exert pressure for actual war on their fragile regimes? Will they, in turn, become the radicalised standard bearers of upheaval?</p> <p>We've lost touch in Britain with the march of cable news, which still attracts only fragments of audience here. It isn't like that in the third world of ferment. When I was in Pakistan this year I found a satellite dish in every flyblown village. It cost two or three pounds a month, shared among the villagers, and it was their window on the world, reaching more than 50% of the entire population. Through that window, now, they will be seeing Jews kill Arab children round the clock, white-faced western reporters, rivers of blood flowing far into the future.</p> <p>There is, if we are honest, a terrible - and new - dilemma here for journalists, and for those who buy their wares. We're hot on our dignity about spin doctoring. We quiver with rage whenever Mr Campbell peddles his tales. But what is this, on a more awful stage, than the work of the spinners of despair?</p> <p>The parents of the West Bank could guard their children. The schools could stay open. The police could control the demonstrations and the age of the demonstrators. Yasser Arafat and Marwan Barghouti, the leader on the streets, could unite to keep the kids away. No more 12 or 13-year-old \"martyrs\". But none of that happens. The spectacle - the spectacle we watch and, in the watching, in the viewing figures, perpetuate - continues.</p> <p>As miserably usual with moral dilemmas, there is no pat solution. Shutting out the cameras and the reporters (as the Israelis would like) isn't an answer: darkness didn't stop the bloodshed in the first intifada, darkness cloaks a multitude of other sins. The sense of a watching world - from Belgrade to Maputo - is a powerful force for good. It may even, here, drive Jerusalem to see what havoc it is making for itself.</p> <p>But if we're going to choose truth above silence, then let it be the truth. And the truth here is not merely that the young men of Israel are shooting the young boys of Palestine, but that we, the reporters on the spot, the cameras, the editors at home and you in your living rooms, are a vital factors in this vile equation.</p> <p>If we understand that, we begin to understand what's going on, and to be able to make judgments of our own as instinctively as we would make them for our own children, the special kids who come first. Without that, there is only one damnable thing after another.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:peter.preston@theguardian.com\">peter.preston@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.secretary.state.gov/index.html\">Madeleine Albright's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.p-p-o.com\">Yasser Arafat's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.pmo.gov.il/english\">Ehud Barak's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.index.gov.il/eng\">Israeli government</a> <br><a <br> </a><a href=\"http://www.moledet.org.il/moleng.htm\" target=\"_new\">Moledet - Land of Israel Loyalty Party (Torah-based religious party)<br> </a><a href=\"http://www.iris.org.il/\" target=\"_new\">Iris - Information Regarding Israel's Security (promoting Israeli security)</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/3188/\" target=\"_new\">Zo Artzeinu (Israeli settlers' group)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.virtual.co.il/orgs/orgs/ichud/irindex.htm\" target=\"_new\">Organization of Rabbis for the People of Israel</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pna.org\">Palestinian National Authority</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.presidency.gov.eg\" target=\"_new\">Egyptian presidency</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.palestine-info.net/hamas/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">Hamas</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Someone, day after day, is killing the children. We see them die, amid blood and grief. Yet in part, as we watch, we are killing them, too. That is the damnable thing about Ramallah and Nablus and Gaza. Consider our children, the children of Britain. They come wrapped, by public consent, in special status: they are minors, kids who aren't responsible and thus the ultimate responsibility of society itself. When their parents abuse or neglect them, they are taken away to a place of protection. The law adopts exceptional measures to hide their identities if they are involved - directly or indirectly - in crime. Schoolteachers can't raise a hand to them on pain of dismissal. Children come first. Press and television, in their own codes of conduct, echo that concern. No identification under the age of 18; no photographs or interviews without parental approval; no invasions of privacy. And not just for Euan Blair or Prince Harry Windsor. If children perish, as they perished at Dunblane, we do not want to see the bodies in the playground nor the parents, engulfed in emotion, talking unwillingly to a prying camera. These children are our children; and their tragedy is our tragedy. Children, in the purest sense, are innocents. Children come first. But on the West Bank or Gaza, children come first in a different way. They are the first to die - from the 12-year-old who died in his father's arms almost three weeks ago to 13-year-old Mohammed al-Najjar, shot in the head this weekend. Try to compute the victims of this latest uprising, this supposed war, and most of the 130 or so dead already are Palestinians - and, overwhelmingly, most of them are kids, teenage lads well short of their legal majority. Thus mothers sob and fathers choke before our eyes. Schoolteachers talk sadly about empty desks. Women pallbearers at the endless funerals chant that \"Israeli peace means killing the children\". Mourning crowds take up the refrain to these teenage \"martyrs\". \"Oh Arabs, pay attention - the Palestinians are getting killed.\" And here is the damnable thing. None of this is an accident, a happenstance, a contrivance of fate. The children are first in the firing line by design. They have become cannon and media fodder. Dr Stephen Males, a former assistant chief constable with a commission from Amnesty International, reported directly the other day on the course of the carnage. \"The key point is that Israel is using military tactics and not establishing policing practices.\" This means that the army - and, yes, thousands of young conscripts - is bent on winning a conflict of retribution and domination the way armies do. \"They are simply trying to wipe out or dominate the enemy\" - while police officers, who know all about crowd control, stand idly by. An appalling verdict, compendiously documented. Israel indicted. And the charge is not just sickening brutality, but imbecile strategy as well. For this, if it is war at all, has turned into a war for hearts and minds. \"One side waits for violence; the other side obligingly shoots them.\" The Palestinians, in turn, actively invite casualties. There's a \"ritual pattern\" to their demonstrations. Their police are not on hand to protect life or defuse tension. \"They make no attempt to stop children and youngsters let out of school for the day from running alongside,\" Males told Michael Binyon of the Times. \"There is a cynical allowance of the enormous risk to their lives.\" Why, you ask, such callous cynicism? Oh Arabs, pay attention. The Palestinians can't \"defeat\" the Israelis (if such a concept has any meaning) by throwing sticks or stones. They have no army worth the name. They cannot wage conventional warfare. What they can do, and are doing, is foment world repugnance. Sit down, in your comfortable western homes: turn on CNN or ITN or the BBC or any of the swelling range of cable channels - and be sickened. More specifically, fill the cable and satellite TV channels of the Middle East - like MBC or ANN - with this everlasting horror, and the leaders of Damascus or Cairo or Riyadh will feel the heat. The boys on their streets see the pictures; they know which side they are on. Can they exert pressure for actual war on their fragile regimes? Will they, in turn, become the radicalised standard bearers of upheaval? We've lost touch in Britain with the march of cable news, which still attracts only fragments of audience here. It isn't like that in the third world of ferment. When I was in Pakistan this year I found a satellite dish in every flyblown village. It cost two or three pounds a month, shared among the villagers, and it was their window on the world, reaching more than 50% of the entire population. Through that window, now, they will be seeing Jews kill Arab children round the clock, white-faced western reporters, rivers of blood flowing far into the future. There is, if we are honest, a terrible - and new - dilemma here for journalists, and for those who buy their wares. We're hot on our dignity about spin doctoring. We quiver with rage whenever Mr Campbell peddles his tales. But what is this, on a more awful stage, than the work of the spinners of despair? The parents of the West Bank could guard their children. The schools could stay open. The police could control the demonstrations and the age of the demonstrators. Yasser Arafat and Marwan Barghouti, the leader on the streets, could unite to keep the kids away. No more 12 or 13-year-old \"martyrs\". But none of that happens. The spectacle - the spectacle we watch and, in the watching, in the viewing figures, perpetuate - continues. As miserably usual with moral dilemmas, there is no pat solution. Shutting out the cameras and the reporters (as the Israelis would like) isn't an answer: darkness didn't stop the bloodshed in the first intifada, darkness cloaks a multitude of other sins. The sense of a watching world - from Belgrade to Maputo - is a powerful force for good. It may even, here, drive Jerusalem to see what havoc it is making for itself. But if we're going to choose truth above silence, then let it be the truth. And the truth here is not merely that the young men of Israel are shooting the young boys of Palestine, but that we, the reporters on the spot, the cameras, the editors at home and you in your living rooms, are a vital factors in this vile equation. If we understand that, we begin to understand what's going on, and to be able to make judgments of our own as instinctively as we would make them for our own children, the special kids who come first. Without that, there is only one damnable thing after another. peter.preston@theguardian.com Useful links Madeleine Albright's office Yasser Arafat's office Ehud Barak's office Israeli government Moledet - Land of Israel Loyalty Party (Torah-based religious party) Iris - Information Regarding Israel's Security (promoting Israeli security) Zo Artzeinu (Israeli settlers' group) Organization of Rabbis for the People of Israel Palestinian National Authority Egyptian presidency Hamas",

Opening the debate, the father of the House, Sir Edward Heath, presiding over the election, angered MPs by insisting that the chamber uses the existing electoral system, which has come in for widespread criticism. He explained that he believed his powers did not extend to changing the system. But he expressed \"sympathy\" for the views of the many MPs who have asked for reform. Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie claimed there was a majority for a change in the rules. \"We make our own rules in this House,\" he argued. Former education minister Gillian Shephard said the \"unprecedented number of contenders for the Speakership\" justified a change. Many MPs backed a two-stage system, proposed by Tony Benn before the contest got under way. They pressed for Sir Edward to allow a vote on whether or not to use it, but he refused. However, Sir Edward did announce the order in which possible Speakers would be nominated, as follows: Michael Martin, Sir Alan Haselhurst, Alan Beith, Gwyneth Dunwoody, Sir George Young, Menzies Campbell, David Clark, Nicholas Winterton, John McWilliam, Michael Lord, Sir Patrick Cormack, Richard Shepherd.",

The deaths brought to 123 the number of people killed in 26 days of fighting. All but eight of those killed have been Arabs.</p> <p>Israeli troops and Palestinian militants traded gunfire in the main street of Hebron, an almost daily event. Palestinian stone throwers also clashed with Israeli soldiers at two trouble spots in the Gaza strip, with 36 Palestinians wounded overall, according to hospital doctors.</p> <p>In the West Bank town of Bethlehem, protesters spray-painted a donkey to resemble the Israeli flag, and tied up the animal in the street where rock throwers and soldiers clashed. The protesters also painted the names of Mr Barak and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on the donkey.</p> <p>With no letup in the confrontations, the Israelis clamped down on several Palestinian areas.</p> <p>The Israelis again closed the Palestinian airport in Gaza City, further restricting Palestinian travel. \"We consider this as another step in the hard siege on the Palestinian people,\" said Salman Abu Halib, general director of Palestinian Airlines.</p> <p>Separately, the Israeli army imposed a blockade on Beit Jalla, a Palestinian town from which Palestinian gunmen have been shooting at the Jewish district of Gilo on the southern outskirts of Jerusalem.</p> <p>Last night, Israel responded to the shooting with missiles and tank-mounted machine-gun fire. Beit Jalla and nearby Bethlehem were plunged in darkness, a Beit Jalla factory was destroyed and several homes damaged.</p> <p>One rocket hit a children's bedroom in the home of the Nazal family in Beit Jalla. Sohana Nazal said moments earlier she had moved her children, George, 3, and Ghada, 2, from the room because it faces Israeli tanks on a nearby hill.</p> <p>\"We heard a loud crash. We thought it [the rocket] had landed on the street. Only when we opened the door to their room and saw all the smoke did we realise what had happened,\" Mrs Nazal said.</p> <p>Hundreds of civilians have fled Beit Jalla and the nearby Aida refugee camp.</p> <p>The Israeli army chief of staff, Lt Gen Shaul Mofaz, said life for the residents of Beit Jalla could only return to normal if the shooting from the Palestinian side stopped. \"If they make it impossible to conduct a normal life on the Israeli side, I do not think we can tolerate such a situation,\" Mr Mofaz told Israel radio.</p> <p>Mr Barak today launched formal talks to broaden his coalition, which at present controls only 30 seats in the 120-member legislature. Parliament returns from summer recess on Sunday. If Mr Barak fails to bring opposition leader Ariel Sharon and his Likud party into the government, early elections appear inevitable.</p> <p>Mr Barak and his negotiators were to meet separately today with Mr Sharon as well as representatives from the ultra-Orthodox Shas party and the dovish Meretz factions, both former coalition members.</p> <p>Mr Sharon has said he would not join the government unless Mr Barak distanced himself from concessions he offered the Palestinians during the Middle East summit at Camp David in the US in July.</p> <p>At the time, Mr Barak was ready to give the Palestinians more than 90% of the West Bank, as well as control over parts of traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.</p> <p>Critics said Mr Sharon's presence in the government would dim hopes for peace.</p> <p>\"I think a national unity government...would make the prospect of peace more distant and undermine the belief in the world that we really do want to make peace,\" said Justice Minister Yossi Beilin of Mr Barak's One Israel alignment.</p> <p>\"If Sharon has the right to veto peace negotiations, I will not be able to sit in it [the government],\" said Mr Beilin, a key player in previous interim accords.</p>",

The start of the formal coalition contacts came a day after the prime minister announced that Israel was taking \"time out\" from peace talks, to the chagrin of US President Bill Clinton and dovish members of Mr Barak's centre-left government. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat riposted by saying Barak could \"go to hell\". In the West Bank town of Nablus, two Palestinian teenagers, aged 15 and 17, died today after being shot in the head during earlier clashes with Israeli troops. The deaths brought to 123 the number of people killed in 26 days of fighting. All but eight of those killed have been Arabs. Israeli troops and Palestinian militants traded gunfire in the main street of Hebron, an almost daily event. Palestinian stone throwers also clashed with Israeli soldiers at two trouble spots in the Gaza strip, with 36 Palestinians wounded overall, according to hospital doctors. In the West Bank town of Bethlehem, protesters spray-painted a donkey to resemble the Israeli flag, and tied up the animal in the street where rock throwers and soldiers clashed. The protesters also painted the names of Mr Barak and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on the donkey. With no letup in the confrontations, the Israelis clamped down on several Palestinian areas. The Israelis again closed the Palestinian airport in Gaza City, further restricting Palestinian travel. \"We consider this as another step in the hard siege on the Palestinian people,\" said Salman Abu Halib, general director of Palestinian Airlines. Separately, the Israeli army imposed a blockade on Beit Jalla, a Palestinian town from which Palestinian gunmen have been shooting at the Jewish district of Gilo on the southern outskirts of Jerusalem. Last night, Israel responded to the shooting with missiles and tank-mounted machine-gun fire. Beit Jalla and nearby Bethlehem were plunged in darkness, a Beit Jalla factory was destroyed and several homes damaged. One rocket hit a children's bedroom in the home of the Nazal family in Beit Jalla. Sohana Nazal said moments earlier she had moved her children, George, 3, and Ghada, 2, from the room because it faces Israeli tanks on a nearby hill. \"We heard a loud crash. We thought it [the rocket] had landed on the street. Only when we opened the door to their room and saw all the smoke did we realise what had happened,\" Mrs Nazal said. Hundreds of civilians have fled Beit Jalla and the nearby Aida refugee camp. The Israeli army chief of staff, Lt Gen Shaul Mofaz, said life for the residents of Beit Jalla could only return to normal if the shooting from the Palestinian side stopped. \"If they make it impossible to conduct a normal life on the Israeli side, I do not think we can tolerate such a situation,\" Mr Mofaz told Israel radio. Mr Barak today launched formal talks to broaden his coalition, which at present controls only 30 seats in the 120-member legislature. Parliament returns from summer recess on Sunday. If Mr Barak fails to bring opposition leader Ariel Sharon and his Likud party into the government, early elections appear inevitable. Mr Barak and his negotiators were to meet separately today with Mr Sharon as well as representatives from the ultra-Orthodox Shas party and the dovish Meretz factions, both former coalition members. Mr Sharon has said he would not join the government unless Mr Barak distanced himself from concessions he offered the Palestinians during the Middle East summit at Camp David in the US in July. At the time, Mr Barak was ready to give the Palestinians more than 90% of the West Bank, as well as control over parts of traditionally Arab east Jerusalem. Critics said Mr Sharon's presence in the government would dim hopes for peace. \"I think a national unity government...would make the prospect of peace more distant and undermine the belief in the world that we really do want to make peace,\" said Justice Minister Yossi Beilin of Mr Barak's One Israel alignment. \"If Sharon has the right to veto peace negotiations, I will not be able to sit in it [the government],\" said Mr Beilin, a key player in previous interim accords.",

Antiques Roadshow, which has just added Mr Aspel to its presenting team, started five minutes earlier and averaged 7.8m and a 34% share. Panorama continued its ratings slide in the second week since the BBC1 current affairs flagship moved from its regular Monday night berth, shedding a further million viewers last night. Last night's edition of Panorama, Digging the Dirt, which tackled the admittedly unsexy subject of the US presidential election, averaged just 2.2m and a 13% share. The previous week Panorama had averaged 3.2m on its 10.15pm Sunday night debut; while the final Monday night edition, on the Omagh bombing, had 4.2m and a 23% share. The current affairs show lost out to ITV's Tarrant on TV repeat, which had 6.2m from 10pm, and its main news bulletin, which averaged 4.6m from 10.30pm. Earlier in the evening, Heartbeat returned to ITV for a new series and comfortably beat a Casualty Sunday night special. The rural police drama averaged 11.5m and a 45% share from 8pm. Casualty could raise only 6.4m and a 25% share from 8.10pm, despite boasting guest appearances from Jenny Seagrove and Beverley Callard (Coronation Street's Liz McDonald).",

      "body": "<p>In a world in which more and more cars look like they have been designed by someone taking a hairdryer to a block of soft cheese, the Beetle is a breath of fresh air. Among the bizarre mobile closets, family spaceships and executive aircraft on the road, it will invariably raise a smile of recognition. It's a smile that seems to be beamed back at you by the design, a simple collection of arcs and circles, bug eyes and a snub nose. </p> <p>No wonder Hitler called it his \"Strength-Through-Joy Car\". His dream was that every member of his \"workforce\" should have a car - a Volksauto. The idea was quietly written off as absurd when he insisted they must be sold for under 1,000 Reichmarks (\u00a385) but one engineer - a certain Dr Ferdinand Porsche - took up the challenge, partly because it coincided with his own ideas for an economy car. Workers paid for the car with a stamp system, accruing tokens that could eventually be swapped for a vehicle. </p> <p>Production was temporarily halted by the second world war but by 1955 no fewer than a million Beetles had scuttled off the assembly line. German production of the original Beetle ended in 1978, but it is still manufactured in Mexico. So when VW radically updated the design a couple of years ago, giving those charming Herbie looks a no less charming turn-of-the-millennium makeover, it was religiously referred to as the New Beetle. The new addition to the range has a 1.6 engine instead of the 2-litre GTi, and does away with the alloy wheels and the air conditioning. More importantly, it costs \u00a32,000 less. </p> <p>The New Beetle has remained faithful to the vehicle's shape. It looks a little like an Audi TT that has been driven through a hall of mirrors, giving it a more dome-like roof without sacrificing that chunky, wide stance on the road, with arches that create the effect of oversized wheels. The two arcs meet to form the back, which is elegant, simple and looks like it belongs. (Why is it that so many cars look like they've left the garage with the wrong backside?) </p> <p>But all of this is really a cosmetic memory of the original. Mechanically it is very different. The VW after-dinner joke about the woman who stops to help a fellow motorist, claiming she has a spare engine in the boot, is now gratifyingly extinct. Flip up the tailgate on the new one and you will discover that they kept everything so neat back there by assuming that you travel rather light. </p> <p>It's quite difficult to comprehend that as you go nipping along the road because the expanse between the steering wheel and the windscreen stretching out towards the horizon could quite happily accommodate a small wedding reception. It's one of the pay-offs of being design-led, like the limited back seats. But for the driver it gives a feeling of being right in the middle of an oval shell, which in turn makes the handling feel immediate. Beetling along with enough room above your head for a fairly extensive afro, you almost expect the vehicle to be ungainly around corners, and to lean forward during braking. But there is very little hangover - it handles like a buggy. And all that room between you and the engine, plus the safety-conscious heavy doors, means good soundproofing. The time lag before acceleration when you hit the floor in second or third is understandably longer with the smaller engine, but it still feels unexpectedly responsive for its unaggressive, soft shaping. </p> <p>Add the airbags, Conran-style handbrake, pretty displays, Electronic Stability Programme (which senses slipping and automatically corrects it by individually braking each wheel), sporty suspension, beverage whatnots and electrically heated this-that-and-the-other and you can see how far it has come from being a basic people's wagon. </p> <p>One other distinguishing feature of the original Beetle has also gone: the ludicrous farmyard farting that used to herald its arrival. That indestructible plodder of an engine, which didn't so much rev as snore, has been replaced by VW's hugely successful 2-litre from the Golf GTi, or, in the latest model, the new 1.6. </p> <p>And what's this? Just between the steering wheel and the dash there is a small plastic funnel. It won't hold a pen, a coffee, a map or a 20p. Maybe it's a valve to stick your lips round and blow up the airbags. The manual is having no jokes about this little homage to the car's hippy status in the Herbie films: \"No articles should be kept in the vase when the vehicle is in motion. This could be a potential danger during a sudden braking manoeuvre as the contents of the vase could fly out and distract the driver from what is happening on the road.\" Just imagine getting a face full of daffodils when you switch on the air conditioning. Tricky. </p> <p>But it's a little emblematic reminder that this is a car with character, and has managed to hang on to it while getting bang up to date. For some drivers, character is a bad word. Character equals frivolous. They want something that looks like a \"serious bit of kit\". But they can keep their motorised willies - this is much more fun. </p> <p><strong> The lowdown</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Volkswagen Beetle 1.6</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Price:</strong> \u00a312,995</p> <p> <strong>Acceleration:</strong> 0-62mph in 11.6 secs</p> <p> <strong>Top speed:</strong> 111mph</p> <p> <strong>Consumption:</strong> 36.7mpg (combined)</p> <p> <strong>At the wheel:</strong> Bod</p> <p> <strong>On the way to:</strong> Interflora</p> <p> <strong>On the stereo:</strong> Herbie Hancock</p>",

The idea was quietly written off as absurd when he insisted they must be sold for under 1,000 Reichmarks (\u00a385) but one engineer - a certain Dr Ferdinand Porsche - took up the challenge, partly because it coincided with his own ideas for an economy car. Workers paid for the car with a stamp system, accruing tokens that could eventually be swapped for a vehicle. Production was temporarily halted by the second world war but by 1955 no fewer than a million Beetles had scuttled off the assembly line. German production of the original Beetle ended in 1978, but it is still manufactured in Mexico. So when VW radically updated the design a couple of years ago, giving those charming Herbie looks a no less charming turn-of-the-millennium makeover, it was religiously referred to as the New Beetle. The new addition to the range has a 1.6 engine instead of the 2-litre GTi, and does away with the alloy wheels and the air conditioning. More importantly, it costs \u00a32,000 less. The New Beetle has remained faithful to the vehicle's shape. It looks a little like an Audi TT that has been driven through a hall of mirrors, giving it a more dome-like roof without sacrificing that chunky, wide stance on the road, with arches that create the effect of oversized wheels. The two arcs meet to form the back, which is elegant, simple and looks like it belongs. (Why is it that so many cars look like they've left the garage with the wrong backside?) But all of this is really a cosmetic memory of the original. Mechanically it is very different. The VW after-dinner joke about the woman who stops to help a fellow motorist, claiming she has a spare engine in the boot, is now gratifyingly extinct. Flip up the tailgate on the new one and you will discover that they kept everything so neat back there by assuming that you travel rather light. It's quite difficult to comprehend that as you go nipping along the road because the expanse between the steering wheel and the windscreen stretching out towards the horizon could quite happily accommodate a small wedding reception. It's one of the pay-offs of being design-led, like the limited back seats. But for the driver it gives a feeling of being right in the middle of an oval shell, which in turn makes the handling feel immediate. Beetling along with enough room above your head for a fairly extensive afro, you almost expect the vehicle to be ungainly around corners, and to lean forward during braking. But there is very little hangover - it handles like a buggy. And all that room between you and the engine, plus the safety-conscious heavy doors, means good soundproofing. The time lag before acceleration when you hit the floor in second or third is understandably longer with the smaller engine, but it still feels unexpectedly responsive for its unaggressive, soft shaping. Add the airbags, Conran-style handbrake, pretty displays, Electronic Stability Programme (which senses slipping and automatically corrects it by individually braking each wheel), sporty suspension, beverage whatnots and electrically heated this-that-and-the-other and you can see how far it has come from being a basic people's wagon. One other distinguishing feature of the original Beetle has also gone: the ludicrous farmyard farting that used to herald its arrival. That indestructible plodder of an engine, which didn't so much rev as snore, has been replaced by VW's hugely successful 2-litre from the Golf GTi, or, in the latest model, the new 1.6. And what's this? Just between the steering wheel and the dash there is a small plastic funnel. It won't hold a pen, a coffee, a map or a 20p. Maybe it's a valve to stick your lips round and blow up the airbags. The manual is having no jokes about this little homage to the car's hippy status in the Herbie films: \"No articles should be kept in the vase when the vehicle is in motion. This could be a potential danger during a sudden braking manoeuvre as the contents of the vase could fly out and distract the driver from what is happening on the road.\" Just imagine getting a face full of daffodils when you switch on the air conditioning. Tricky. But it's a little emblematic reminder that this is a car with character, and has managed to hang on to it while getting bang up to date. For some drivers, character is a bad word. Character equals frivolous. They want something that looks like a \"serious bit of kit\". But they can keep their motorised willies - this is much more fun.

At the weekend, he talked of taking a \"time out\", suggesting that, for the time being at least, Israel's only dealings with its immediate neighbours would be through the smoking barrels of its soldiers' guns. Now Barak is talking of \"a review\" of the stalled peace negotiation, which suggests that he might be preparing for a new round of diplomatic contacts with Yasser Arafat to defuse the crisis. In reality, while fighting still rages along Israel's ill-defined border with Arafat's nascent statelet, Barak has little scope for manoeuvre. His opinion poll ratings have plummeted, and there are rumbles of dissent from within his own political faction. When the Knesset (parliament) reconvenes next week, he could quickly be in terminal trouble. In the short term, Barak desperately needs to shore up his coalition by including the hawkish Likud bloc in a government of national unity. Likud leader Ariel Sharon would love to be back in the cabinet, but knows that his hardliners could desert him if he does a deal with the prime minister. The Israeli public, thoroughly rattled by the prolonged savagery on its doorstep, is sick of the political argy-bargy. It wants action. That is why Barak is now playing with the old, tired chestnut of 'unilateral separation': creating a fortified de-facto boundary round the Palestinian enclaves of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. It is a tactic not only flawed, but doomed. It has been tried many times before, and has always disintegrated when it came up against political and economic reality. Firstly, after more than 30 years of occupation, the Palestinian territories are effectively an integral part - though a distinctly poor relation - of the Israeli economy. To have any hope of survival, let alone development, they depend on Israeli infrastructure. And Israel, in its turn, has come to depend on cheap Palestinian labour. Secondly, in the West Bank the Palestinian enclaves are cut off from each other. Sealing off each one would be a Herculean task, even for the formidable Israeli army, especially as it has simultaneously to defend the clutter of Jewish settlements in the territory. And then there is the small matter of the chunk of Israel that separates the West Bank from the Gaza Strip. It is a measure of their desperation that - not for the first time - Israelis are talking of building a 28-mile elevated highway between the two territories, to literally get over the problem. Thirdly, simply sealing off the Palestinians might make the problem disappear from sight, but it won't make that problem go away. For a start, one-third of the three million Palestinians under Israeli rule, live in Israel itself. There they are known as Israeli Arabs, but the vast majority identify themselves as Palestinians - though they don't necessarily want to live in Arafat's dingy little statelet. The greatest objection to unilateral separation - apart from it being inherently racist - is that it will not address, let alone solve, the issue at the core of the crisis. That is, the definition of the status and the boundaries of the full-fledged Palestinian state that everyone knows is coming.

In July this year, a magistrate found Mrs Evans guilty of slapping a 10-year-old boy across the face, but the verdict was overturned on appeal at Cardiff crown court. She had hoped to return to her post at the school after the appeal, but the fresh allegations meant she continued to be suspended from her post.</p> <p>Mr Evans, who repeatedly protested her innocence, told a press conference in Cardiff: \"I feel relief and delight that the CPS has decided to take no further action against me. However I'm also angry that this whole episode has dragged on for a whole year. I thought this whole ordeal was over when I was cleared at Cardiff crown court.\" She added: \"The last six weeks have been the most stressful weeks of my whole life. I was shocked and dumbfounded when I heard of the new allegations. It distresses me to think that anyone in the teaching profession could suffer the same ordeal as I have had to suffer.\" National Union of Teachers general secretary Doug McAvoy said in a statement: \"The union is delighted that Marjorie Evans is not to face further prosecution. I hope this brings an end to the torment she has suffered for more than a year. There are lessons to be learned from the way this matter has been conducted. We hope they have been learned.\" New guidelines on how to deal with disruptive children were being distributed to union members this week, Mr McAvoy added.</p>",

      "bodyText": "No further action will be taken against Welsh headteacher Marjorie Evans, who was recently cleared of slapping one of her pupils, police announced today. The crown prosecution service has decided not to pursue further allegations by staff that she mistreated pupils, although it is up to Monmouthshire county council to decide whether she can take up her job again. \"We have received advice from the CPS on further inquiries relating to St Mary's Junior School in Caldicot and, having discussed the evidence in full, the police and the CPS are in agreement that no further action should be taken,\" said chief inspector Nigel Russell. In July this year, a magistrate found Mrs Evans guilty of slapping a 10-year-old boy across the face, but the verdict was overturned on appeal at Cardiff crown court. She had hoped to return to her post at the school after the appeal, but the fresh allegations meant she continued to be suspended from her post. Mr Evans, who repeatedly protested her innocence, told a press conference in Cardiff: \"I feel relief and delight that the CPS has decided to take no further action against me. However I'm also angry that this whole episode has dragged on for a whole year. I thought this whole ordeal was over when I was cleared at Cardiff crown court.\" She added: \"The last six weeks have been the most stressful weeks of my whole life. I was shocked and dumbfounded when I heard of the new allegations. It distresses me to think that anyone in the teaching profession could suffer the same ordeal as I have had to suffer.\" National Union of Teachers general secretary Doug McAvoy said in a statement: \"The union is delighted that Marjorie Evans is not to face further prosecution. I hope this brings an end to the torment she has suffered for more than a year. There are lessons to be learned from the way this matter has been conducted. We hope they have been learned.\" New guidelines on how to deal with disruptive children were being distributed to union members this week, Mr McAvoy added.",

To some extent it is still iffy, the home of tacky stars - Jim Davidson - flashy sets, end of the pier variety ... and the Lottery. Eighteen months ago, in desperation and with the cupboard bare, the BBC hired a young turk working for Bazalgette, doubled his salary, installed him in Television Centre, and gave him the freedom to operate and be rewarded like a top independent producer. </p> <p>David Young, at 32, is rebuilding the BBC's output. His clarion calls include: \"Forget about the 11 O'Clock Show, think mainstream\" and \"don't be snooty about daytime\". And instead of giving holidays as prizes, he's won the battle to offer big cash prizes on BBC1. </p> <p>A fluent talker clad in a black Joseph suit, Young happily agrees he lacked experience when he came on board. He was hired because he had so many ideas in development and had this unstoppable entrepreneurial energy. Now he's got hits. </p> <p>The BBC is, naturally, milking every drop from the novel experience of owning the rights to a show so hot it is moving to BBC1 (the champions from the BBC2 series will compete against each other). Kevin Lygo, Channel 4's head of entertainment, says: \"It is strange and encouraging that the BBC can move so fast.\" The show is also being sold abroad (Germany and the US) along with another Young department hit format, Friends Like These (Holland, Belgium) in which teams of teenagers compete. </p> <p>When the Weakest Link hits BBC1, the prize money is going up to \u00a320,000, the highest ever offered by the channel - doubling the show's BBC2 limit. This reverses the policy contained in the BBC producers' guidelines, reissued by Dyke only last year, which encapsulate \"BBC values and standards\". Page 197 says: \"Cash prizes should be avoided ... It is inappropriate to spend licence fee money on prizes of excessive value.\" </p> <p>Young is endearingly frank: \"We're always being told 'you can't do big money'. The Gen [Generation] Game gives away holidays, how much do they think they cost?\" He shrugs: \"Most producers' guidelines are so ambiguous - it's the controllers who say what you can do.\" </p> <p>He's right, the guidelines also say: \"Any proposal to offer a cash prize must be referred to the head of output and the controller must be informed.\" </p> <p>Bazalgette, a former BBC producer, comments: \"That's radical. A big story. This is prize money not funded by phone calls [as in Millionaire]. In my view, it's wholly admirable. Greg has thrown open the curtains at the BBC. Light entertainment was so bad, stale, turgid, it had to get better.\" </p> <p>Lygo is doubtful though: \"Is it right that the equivalent of all the licence fees from a small Oxford village should go to fund that? It's a bit off for the BBC. They have managed for years without big prizes.\" </p> <p>Young has brought to the BBC a razor-sharp commercial edge, honed by nine years at Hat Trick, then Bazal. Poacher turned gamekeeper, he now aims to push back the independents who supply everything from Have I Got News For You to Star For a Night and Robot Wars. </p> <p>He hails from Woking in Surrey, went to a comprehensive school and is the son of a gas engineer and social worker. At Bristol University (\"the nice thing about it, it was very non-public school\") he studied drama. He always wanted to work in television, and wangled his way into Hat Trick as runner while still a student. He almost didn't finish his degree, returning late with a month's sick note (faked asthma attack), only to have his tutor see his name on the credits of Clive Anderson Talks Back. </p> <p>Denise O'Donoghue, the joint managing director of Hat Trick who hired him, says: \"Age doesn't matter. We knew very early on that David was very creative, he had talent, flair, energy, imagination and determination. At the BBC he's built something from nothing, got them hit shows.\" Young had a big falling out with Hat Trick in 1997 over Whatever You Want, a show he devised. But because he had a share of the format potential, it gave him some breathing space. </p> <p>Young eventually rang Peter Bazalgette (\"I regard him as the guv'nor of ideas\"), and went to see him: \"He was the rudest person I'd ever been interviewed by, so cutting, he didn't really want me. He thought, 'He's only done one thing'.\" Young asked for a sizeable salary and shares in his productions because \"I've always believed format creators should be rewarded. If you'd given away Millionaire it's like not signing the Beatles\". When Paul Jackson (who said of him: \"He has more ideas than my entire department\"), outgoing BBC controller of entertainment, came calling to poach him from Bazal, Young was surprised but couldn't resist. </p> <p>At the BBC, Young has introduced a permanent development team of six: \"I've created a mini-Bazal. Imported his system. We pay them to sit and think up ideas. They're a fantastic team.\" He describes organised brainstorming session where nothing is unacceptable (\"You don't criticise someone's ideas unless it's constructive\"). </p> <p>\"I believe there are lots of people who can execute programmes, but very few who can create them,\" he says. \"When you find creative people, you need to pluck them out of production, pay them decently, and persuade them to sit in a development office and work on ideas.\" His head of development, Andy Culpin, who suggested Anne Robinson for The Weakest Link, came from Bazal (\"Baz was furious\") where he'd been a \u00a3300-a-week trainee. </p> <p>\"The agreement was I could come in, bring in a team. I didn't have to work with anyone here unless I wanted to. I found a complete and utter lack of ideas. Shocking. The wrong people were doing development, being paid thousands of pounds.\" One of his ideas team was leasing photocopiers when Young hired him; within six months he'd won a commission from BBC Choice for Simply Complicated - a competition to invent daft machines (for example, to spread jam on bread). It's coming to BBC1. </p> <p>\"As a viewer of the BBC I'd get quite angry, I like to see good ideas. It was all star vehicles. It was Jim [Davidson] does this, so-and-so does that.\" He applied exactly what he'd learned: \"The idea is the star. Out of great formats like Have I Got News For You, Hat Trick have created huge TV stars, but the format comes first.\" </p> <p>Young launches into a tragi-comic account of one star vehicle he gleefully junked. Called Thank You, it used the stars to go around ... thanking people! \"But if you get the idea right the talent will come and more importantly they will stay. Agents are saying to me 'Show me the idea'. Look at Lulu and [the Saturday-night flop] Red Alert. You realise how damaging that can be for an artist's career if they front the wrong show.\" </p> <p>In an analogy that's pure Bazalgette, he compares his team to \"an ad agency - the channel controllers are the clients, we have to solve their problems\". This was how The Weakest Link was devised. One of the team's trainees brought him the title after looking at hundreds of letters. Two outsiders, Dr Finton Coyle and Cathy Dunning, wrote in (and now gain fees for the concept). </p> <p>His team \"just batted it around\" for months and months, arguing, testing it. \"When we pitched it to [BBC daytime head] Jane Lush, it was flawed, we planned originally to run it over five days, with only a resolution at the end of that time - bad. The rounds were too long, 20 minutes at one point; now they're two and-a-half minutes and get 10 seconds less with each round,\" as nine contestants are whittled down to two. \"Every show I do always has some reference to the penalty shoot out, the greatest ever endgame. You're gripped.\" Young flourishes a list of 23 pilots for new shows: \"Trial and error, that's what I like at the BBC: just have a go.\" </p> <p>He's hatched a deal with BBC Worldwide and they pay \u00a350,000 towards the \u00a3200,000 cost of each new pilot. But the BBC will now co-produce new formats abroad, with an executive producer in control - so \"we make more money\" says Colin Jarvis, director of programming at BBC Worldwide. Young also pitches new pilots to channel controllers this way: \"Buy four, get one free!\" Key production creatives gain bonuses from sales. </p> <p>Not all of them work: Stars Sing the Beatles flopped (\"won't be doing any more of those,\" he chuckles). But Dog Eat Dog, a game of one-upmanship, is one to watch, as is Playing for Time. The department now has \u00a325m in fresh commissions including new Lottery shows, Jet Set and Lucky Sevens, the slot snatched back from Bazal. He recalls how at Bazal the team pinched the Lottery show from the BBC department he now heads: \"When we knew we were competing with in-house, we were like lions to their wildebeest.\" </p> <p>\"I'd never worked for BBC, never wanted to work for the BBC, but I loved the BBC as a viewer.\" So he pitched up there, and is having a ball. At the end of the interview he chuckles about yet another innovation, a Christmas special of the Weakest Link's Bad Losers. It's only afterwards that I realise he's not mentioned the phrase \"public service broadcasting\" once.</p>",

Friday night on BBC2 is to settle down as a soft history/documentary zone, the place where gardening and lifestyle gives way to programmes liked by middle-aged viewers.

The upside, she says, is that there is more capacity to commission other things, and the blows have been softened with an extra \u00a325m this year to boost her budget. </p> <p>\"She thought she was running one sort of channel, and has made a good try at giving it some identity.

Though BBC2 will continue to strip The Weakest Link, a hasty weekly champions' version of the show will go on prime-time BBC1.

In prime time last week BBC2 was down around 2.3%, and may well slip below 10% as the new schedules bite. In fairness, all the minority channels were hit last week.

Robinson dismisses each departing contestant with her catchphrase: \"You're the weakest link, goodbye.\" Participants in the daytime version pocket between \u00a31,500 and \u00a32,000. A BBC spokesman said: \"You have to put it in context. We are not giving away \u00a31m and we don't believe \u00a320,000 is an unreasonable amount, especially when you take into account the fact that the odds against anyone winning it are high.\" Cheap at the price The BBC's track record in game shows: Generation Game Now spiced up with exotic holidays, strict rules used to mean that contestants rarely went away with more than the deep fat fryer and cuddly toy. Oh for the return of the glory days of Larry Grayson and Isla St Clair. Crackerjack For the privilege of being covered in slime and humiliation on national television, schoolchildren aspired to that great giveaway, a Crackerjack pencil and pen. Blankety Blank Terry Wogan, Les Dawson and Lily Savage never let their guests go away empty-handed. As well as toasters and towel sets, contestants got the show's chequebook and pen. Mastermind The privilege was to take part in this general knowledge quiz. The only prize on offer was a fetching piece of crystal.",

Sixteen people died, two of them so completely destroyed that nothing remained from which to identify them. Two gravestones had to be put up in the yard of RTS itself since there was nothing left to bury in a proper cemetery, not even a ring or an ID card. </p> <p>Yet it was this same building in central Belgrade that Serbia's anti-Milosevic protesters had as number two on their list of targets in this month's uprising. Like Nato, they too saw it as a hated symbol of the regime, and as soon as the Federal parliament building had been stormed they turned their anger on RTS.

Not everyone saw Nato as the primary villain, and certainly not as the exclusive one. Now under new editorship, RTS has just marked its liberation from the one-sided propaganda of the Milosevic years by screening a remarkable documentary about the Nato bombing of its own building. Anatomy of Pain had previously been aired only on the small network of private TV stations available in some provincial towns. In Belgrade it had a single showing before an invited audience in a local cinema this summer. </p> <p>The millions of Serbs who saw it on RTS last week were treated to a harrowing set of interviews with the parents and wives of the 16 people who died. Obliquely, and without heavy explanation since the film was made under the conditions of dictatorship, one of the grieving relatives every so often throws in a soft accusation or a leading question. Why was every other government building that was hit by Nato evacuated long before it was struck? Why didn't the RTS management empty the building, especially after foreign TV journalists, who had been using it for their transmissions, stopped coming about a week before the attack? Did the government want a large number of casualties as a propaganda weapon against Nato? </p> <p>As though in answer to the last question, the film shows a clip of Tatjana Lenard, one of RTS's best-known announcers and a member of JUL, the party founded by Slobodan Milosevic's wife, Mira Markovic. Two weeks before the strike, she is shown on air taunting Nato: \"We're waiting for you. Shoot us if you like. We won't stop working.\" The night Nato struck, she was not in the building. </p> <p>Janko Balyak, the film's 35-year-old director, is planning to make a second part to the film, this time focusing on its storming during this month's protests. In the early 1990s he worked in RTS's cultural department and knew some of those who died. The new film will be a much sharper and clearer attack on the RTS management. \"I hope it will lead to a trial of the RTS directors for negligence in leaving their staff in the building. For most of the relatives, Nato was an invisible enemy, almost like something from outer space. They blame the management in the first place for the 16 deaths\", he says. </p> <p>The back of the sprawling building where the Nato missile hit was deliberately left by the Milosevic regime as it was on the night of the attack. A dozen burnt-out cars remain in the yard, whitened by the colossal heat as though they have been coated with sand from a tropical beach. Curtains flap in the draught that comes through the building's shattered window-frames. A potted plant on the third floor still flourishes, the only remaining sign of life. </p> <p>There is a new message now. On the wall in the yard someone has scrawled the main slogan of the Belgrade autumn: \"He is finished.\" A few yards away stands the memorial erected by the families, with the names of the dead and the single word \"Why?\". A few days ago an unknown vandal removed the flowers and replaced them with cabbages and a bottle of cooking oil. </p> <p>Sitting in the kitchen of their suburban house in Beli Potok on the southern outskirts of Belgrade, Kurman and Mirjana Stojmenovski never stop asking themselves the question, now compounded by uncertainty as to why anyone would want to tamper with the memorial. Their son, Darko, was 25 when he died, the youngest of the 16 victims. \"When you lose a son or daughter in a car accident, you also suffer. But there are not the same questions. We are still waiting for answers. For a long time it was taboo to discuss it. When the bombing started, we were afraid for Darko. All his friends were called up into the army. He wasn't, and we thought he would be safer working at RTS.\" The couple are still wearing black clothes. </p> <p>\"He was sure Nato warned people before they hit targets. When they bombed RTS in the city of Novi Sad, the building was empty. We still can't get into the minds of people who would leave people there. No one in the senior management was in the building at 2am when the missile struck. One girl on the night shift was the daughter of Dusan Vojvodic, a senior editor. He rang her and urged her to leave before the missile struck,\" they add. </p> <p>The Stojmenovskis say they opposed Milosevic's policies for at least 10 years. During the bombing they were shocked to see tanks and armoured personnel carriers from a nearby base camouflaged in suburban streets in their neighbourhood. Soldiers were sleeping in local schools and kindergartens. They found this a reckless and irresponsible playing with civilian lives, though typical of Milosevic. \"The government would have been happier if it had been 50 or 100 people killed at RTS, not 16,\" Mr Stojmenovski says bitterly. </p> <p>They and three other families have started a case against Nato at the European Court for Human Rights. But the main purpose, they say, is to get Nato to open its files. \"This could show whether Nato warned RTS that an attack was coming. This would prove that the management deliberately sacrificed our children,\" he explains. \"But even if the management didn't know, they're still responsible for failing to take sufficient precautions to protect their staff.\" Shortly before last month's elections which brought Milosevic's downfall, the regime held a war crimes trial for Bill Clinton, Tony Blair, and other Nato leaders in absentia. \"They invited us to go as witnesses, but we refused,\" says Mirjana Stojmenovski. \"But we decided to turn up as members of the public just to see. It was a political farce.\" </p> <p>Amazingly calm and clear-eyed in their political views, the Stojmenovskis regret that it has taken so long for other Serbs to see things the way they do. \"It will take time for people to come round to our point of view. They share our grief but still think Milosevic was right. I said to them, 'If you are such patriots, why don't you go down to Kosovo and defend it yourselves?' Nato killed our son, but I can't have any influence on Nato. I expect my government to do the best for its people. Unfortunately, Milosevic needed this war to stay in power,\" says Kurman Stojmenovski. Now that Anatomy of Pain has been aired on RTS itself, they hope more Serbs will accept that truth.</p>",

      "body": "<p>It is estimated that, for the first time this year, more than $1bn will be spent on the elections in the US (state as well as presidential). Of this figure, $400m will go on advertising. Surely, at these levels of spend, there must be much to learn from America? It is well known that both Conservatives and Labour visit the US to learn what's new in electioneering. Should the advertising advisers go there too? </p> <p>The simple answer is that they needn't bother. There is now a convenient website (<a href=\"http://www.adcritic.com\">www.adcritic.com</a>) that keeps you up to date with advertising in the US, even featuring the latest TV commercials for the candidates. Which is lucky, because it wouldn't be worth the price of a ticket to see the drab succession of tit-for-tat commercials that both camps are churning out. </p> <p>This is a missed opportunity. As Roy Spence, president of ad agency GSD&amp;M of Austin, Texas points out: \"Unlike in the past, advertising could play a pivotal role in this election. In the past there were fundamental differences, and the ads played a supportive role to the messages. The issues and personalities were so stark, publicity played a supporting, not a primary, role. This time the economy is strong, there's not a world at war, Bush has moved to the middle, and there's a lot of blurring of lines in terms of the average person out there. All of that leads to advertising playing a major role.\" </p> <p>In the event, however, this has not been the outcome. Kathy Delaney, creative director of the Deutsch ad agency in New York, says: \"Both candidates do themselves a disservice by producing commercials that look and sound like bad informercials. They're invisible. It's 'Blah, blah, blah' cut against sappy music. Compelling, single-minded, believable commercials are completely missing here. The best advertising starts with a single honest truth about the brand. This stuff is served up in such a mundane, cliched way that even if there is a truth in there, it blew right by me.\" </p> <p>What the hapless US viewers are getting is what we used to get in UK party political broadcasts in the 70s - the illustrated talking head. The candidate talks to camera and when he makes a point you cut away to an illustration, as though you were a backward child who needed it all spelt out in picture-book style. </p> <p>So Bush addresses you on medical matters and when he says something about old people you get a picture of someone being pushed along in a wheelchair. In really exciting versions you get a bit of tabletop illustration, too - maybe a pile of dollar bills to make the point that it will cost money. </p> <p>There are two sorts of these commercials. First there's the one where the talking head says what his policy is before slagging off the other guy's stance on that area. The subject changes almost daily (the environment on Wednesday, Medicare on Thursday) and takes different forms for each state and for each ethnic and linguistic group (no wonder they have to be cheap and quickly made). Second, there's the \"morning in America\" life story of the candidate. It's not really advertising at all. </p> <p>The only change of pace comes from Ralph Nader (the ex-consumerist leader and now an independent presidential candidate). He makes TV ads attacking both the other candidates for spending fortunes making TV ads! </p> <p>What has happened? No especially golden period of US political advertising springs to mind, but there have been some memorable ads - LBJ's anti-Goldwater \"Daisy\" ad, with the child counting down to an atomic explosion; the unfair but memorable Republican attack on Dukakis's furlough policy that supposedly let killers out of jail to kill again. </p> <p>It seems that now the politicians have decided that they know it all and give no room to the advertising advisers (there was a telling shot in the programme about Clinton's Little Rock campaign headquarters, featuring a staff member on the telephone \"ordering up\" a tightly specified ad for the following day). That's not advertising. That's just spin, baldly stated in TV slots. There is no \"defining\" advertising theme, no strategy. Its use is solely tactical and day to day. </p> <p>The past 20 years have seen political campaigners on both sides of the Atlantic come on in leaps and bounds in their understanding of how to get through to the public. Much of this is learned from the world of advertising: the focus-group feedback, the concise message, speaking in unison, the need for repetition. Politicians have got very good at communicating - so good, it seems, that they have decided there's no room left for the input of advertising agencies. In the US, tedious ads make it obvious that the creative imagination has not been allowed to brighten things up. </p> <p>Things are rather different in the UK. Peter Mandelson learned the tricks of the trade early on and his Millbank army no longer feels the need for much more than spiky executions of its briefs. The Conservatives have always contracted it out anyway. Saatchis did it all, whether Tim Bell or, successfully in 92 and disastrously in 97, Maurice Saatchi was in charge. After the spectacular failure of their advertising strategy in 97, the Conservatives have clearly decided to internalise strategy too, with the appointment of Yellow M to do the executions. </p> <p>Both Labour and the Conservatives seem to feel that while there's not much room for ad-agency thinking, there's still a role for the memorable ad. With Trevor Beattie and Yellow M - two \"shock jocks\" if ever there were any - we should see some sparks. </p> <p>Despite the fact that the UK is unlikely to be as boring as the US, advertising could be doing more for political parties here as well as across the Atlantic. Brand advertising that creates such enormously valuable properties for companies comes from the understanding that thinking can't sensibly be separated from execution. The great campaigns come from the interaction of strategic planning and creative skills. Big brand owners, like VW or Orange, don't instruct their agencies in detailed content, but allow them latitude to spot the public's nerve end, both in the route to choose and the way that it is expressed. </p> <p>There is a role for advertising in politics beyond the recitation of policy and abuse of the other side. Parties benefit from clarity of positioning in the electorate's mind, and this needs constant adaptation as the context changes. Much of this is done, of course, by the character and message of the leader. But advertising can also delineate the territory. Mitterrand stood for president with a poster that just said \"La force tranquille\", which neatly summed up what he offered in the chaotic environment of French politics. Wilson's Labour grabbed the moment of a dying Conservative government with \"Let's Go with Labour\". </p> <p>Current political advertising is not using any of the skills that advertising agencies have in abundance: the ability to get under the skin of the public, to have insights that coincide with the way the voters, and not the politicians, see it. Advertising can do more than it is being asked to, almost as much in the UK as in the US. </p> <p>\u0095 Chris Powell is chairman of BMP DDB and led Labour's 1997 election campaign advertising</p>",

Editorially, we have focused on the business, financial and political news of importance to our audience. In our launch issue, we revealed that Govan had lost a major shipyard contract, a story the rest of the Scottish press caught up with this week, and since then we have exposed the Scottish Executive's U-turn to build the vital M74 motorway linking Glasgow to the south, reported on a \u00a3170m drop in Scottish venture-capital deals, a major extension of public/private deals by the Scottish Executive and we launched ScottTECH, our own unique index designed to track Scotland's fast-growing technology, media and telecoms companies. </p> <p>Scotland's journalist of the year, Ian Bell, has shown why he remains one of our country's most gifted writers. We have a 16-page Investor section which has won enormous praise, and an absolute gem in our p.m. features pages, which no one expected from a business paper but which everyone has praised. While Neil prefers to hide behind \"industry sources\", I prefer to quote someone real - former Scotsman editor and current Times columnist Magnus Linklater, who described Business a.m. as a \"serious and professional paper\". The FT, while acknowledging that Business a.m. was a rival publication in the Scottish market, printed a favourable analysis of \"the UK's first dedicated tabloid business newspaper\".

In two or three weeks, we anticipate that we will be able to publish audited figures which show that Business a.m.'s circulation is in excess of 10,000 copies a day. </p> <p>And today, Business a.m. goes on sale in London for the first time.

Sarah Kennedy is a scream. Then it's Radio 4 for the rest of the day. I like having the people talking in the background when I'm having a break from writing. Ads: I can't think of any I like particularly. That Budweiser one annoys me. It's just gone on too long. Multimedia: I'm a big fan of the internet. I like all the news sites and there's a site called eyestorm which is great. It's like walking into a cool art gallery where people sneer at you but it's a beautiful site. \u0095 Trezza Azzopardi's novel, The Hiding Place (Picador), has been shortlisted for the Booker Prize and longlisted for the Guardian First Book Prize.",

A prime minister is no longer allowed to look like a mouse, no matter how mighty. </p> <p>Welcome to Italy's election campaign, where the path to power is via permanent tans, Hollywood smiles and glossy hair. Keep your eyes peeled for policies, they don't show up so brightly on television. Victory belongs to whichever side masters image, for this is a campaign fought almost exclusively through the media. Never have soundbites, photo opportunities and spin mattered so much. </p> <p>Silvio Berlusconi, the conservative opposition leader and media magnate, is firing up his newspapers and television stations for a US presidential-style campaign. Opinion polls put him on course for a spectacular come-back, seven years after he tumbled from the premiership in disgrace. </p> <p>The centre-left government, shaky after four troubled years in power, reckoned its best chance was to chew up its third leader and come up with one even silkier than Berlusconi. The signal for Amato, 61, to walk the plank. He will step down before the election, a decision he announced on a chat show, Porta a Porta. </p> <p>Enter Francesco Rutelli, 46, the mayor of Rome and arguably Italy's best-looking politician. A clean cut, relaxed style has invited comparisons to Tony Blair. Others call him Cicciobello, after a plastic doll. He is not well known and his policies, if he has any, remain a mystery. But that will change from today when he launches his campaign in Milan. Few are better at kissing babies, shaking hands or working crowds. </p> <p>The veteran commentator Indro Montanelli despaired that Italy was choosing leaders based on looks. The newspaper La Repubblica was kinder. \"Rutelli is the novelty, the generational turn, the spirit of competition, the challenge on Berlusconi's grounds of modernisation, newness and image.\" Either way, the scene is set for a campaign which is likely to turn dirty. </p> <p>Too much is at stake, and too many voters floating, to be otherwise. The election is not due until April 2001 but the battle is already turning hot. Rutelli has enlisted Stan Greenberg, the American campaign guru who advised Bill Clinton, Tony Blair and Gerhard Schr\u00f6der and was the alleged mastermind of Al Gore's uxorious kiss at the Democratic convention. \"We will have a few surprises for Mr Berlusconi,\" smiled the mayor. </p> <p>The Queen became a pawn last week. After being greeted by Rutelli in Rome it was vital to the opposition for their man to get a chance to bask in regal glory, which he did in Milan. The jostling for front row seats in St Peter's square will be intense next month when Pope John Paul II proclaims Sir Thomas More the patron saint of politicians. Recent photo opportunities have shown both candidates replicating famous Benito Mussolini images of harvesting crops and embracing children. Commentators are divided over whether the echoes were intentional. </p> <p>Berlusconi, 64, who has a tight rein on his coalition, has successfully presented the myriad corruption allegations against him as judicial witch-hunts. He launched his campaign this month with a billboard blitz which has papered Italy blue. \"More pensions for everybody,\" says the caption, beneath a tanned, beaming visage which appears to be from 15 years ago. \"More hair for everybody,\" sniggers the government. </p> <p>Estimated to be worth $13bn, the owner of AC Milan football club returned from his Bermuda holiday home with 25 \"recipes\" for a better future involving jobs, tax breaks and crackdowns on illegal immigration. Cheered on by his three TV stations and publishing empire, he has brushed aside criticisms that such power will present conflict of interest issues if he is elected. The man who brought soap operas and show girls to Italian TV always appears sunny. He stops smiling only when denouncing his opponents as \"child-eating communists\". </p> <p> Family and yacht complete the image. His 34-year-old daughter Marina, vice-president of his holding company Fininvest, posed in a black bikini for the lifestyle magazine Oggi while the accompanying text praised her physique and brains. Kristen Pazik, the girlfriend of Berlusconi's son Pier Silvio, 31, posed nude for an eight-page spread in Italy's GQ magazine. Her potential father-in-law was the most fascinating man in the world, she revealed. Flaunting wealth is a calculated gamble to appeal to Italian aspirations. </p> <p>The man the media call the Cavalier intends to replicate the tactics which won him last April's regional election. A 37,000-tonne cruiser ship, renamed the Ship of Freedom, was backed up with a fleet of planes and vehicles. Berlusconi instructed canvassers to carry sweets to ward off bad breath, a handkerchief to dry their hands and to always clean public lavatories after use in case voters thought they had dirtied them. \"Make sincere compliments to people. Tell the ladies, 'what a lovely smile, what elegance'.\" </p> <p>He is competing with Rutelli for floating centrist Catholics. \"Anti-communism is a moral duty,\" he has repeatedly said. \"We have two candidates fighting a presidential-style campaign, just like Blair and Hague, but without a cohesive two-party system behind them. They do not have fully developed manifestos on which people can judge them, so image becomes more important,\" says James Walston, of the American University of Rome. </p> <p>Flashes of dirty tricks are a taste of what is likely to come, says Prof Walston. Branded an abortionist and derided by Berlusconi allies for adopting an Ecuadorean child, Rutelli has reminded voters that the Cavalier has been married twice. Oblique references to sexuality have been made. </p> <p>Today's press conference in Milan, his opponent's heartland, is a typically bold move but Rutelli has a mountain to climb. Fractious and unwieldy, the ruling coalition surprised itself by managing to agree on a new name: \"The Olive Tree Together for Italy\". Not quite as snazzy as Berlusconi's House of Liberty. But it's Rutelli's job to make up for that. He will spend the next few months traversing Italy in a bus trying to build momentum.

They wanted me on the show as a \"victim\". </p> <p>I was unfortunate enough to be one of the 200 or so people who caught the 12.10 London to Leeds train on Tuesday last week. That morning I'd been in the ITN building on Gray's Inn Road collecting a computer. I was on my way back to my office in Leeds. A routine journey. </p> <p>Or at least it was until just before 12.30 when the crash took place. </p> <p>My first instincts were journalistic. I dug out my mobile and told the Channel 4 News newsdesk that I'd been in a serious train crash. It was only later that the bizarre transition from reporter to victim took place. </p> <p>As I walked towards the back of the train the severity of the accident became clear. Half the roof of the buffet car had been ripped off and it was with trepidation that I looked in at the twisted metal of the seats and the litter of newspapers and bags. I expected to see mangled corpses. </p> <p>Later I'd hear myself describing that moment again and again on radio and TV. I did a live interview with the ITN's new 24-hour news channel and then the ITV lunchtime bulletin. I said the roof had been peeled back \"like a sardine can\". </p> <p>As the other passengers were led away to be taken on to the reception centre I asked to stay behind. I still thought of myself as a reporter and that helped me deal with the horror of it. But as soon as I stepped over the police cordon at the end of the road I stopped being a reporter and became one of the reported. By the time I crossed that makeshift line I was the only eye-witness still on the scene and everyone needed a first-hand account of what had happened. </p> <p>I've been part of the press pack many times but I've never had to face it and I wasn't really prepared for how it would feel. </p> <p>I agreed to do an interview with ITN's ITV team. The camera was set up just beyond the police cordon. As soon as the interview began all the other journalists huddled around. There seemed to be dozens of them: five or more TV crews, a clutch of press photographers and who knows how many radio and print journalists. </p> <p>It's a very strange thing to have that much attention focused on you. The lights, the people fighting to ask the next question. Even more strange is when your interviewers have got the quotes they want. Then - almost as quickly as the press pack gathers - it evaporates. Everyone is off to ferret out the next element of their story. </p> <p>Normally I'd be with them. Today I was the one left on my own. </p> <p>There's no doubt that in a crisis like this it can be cathartic to talk about what has happened - it certainly was for me. But as I discovered, it's a dangerous game. I wanted the attention but what I wasn't ready for was how it would feel when the pack turned its back. You're left feeling very lonely. And for people who don't understand the workings of the press that feeling must be even more pronounced. </p> <p>One of the ITN cameramen - Bruce Shayler - must have sensed that I was starting to get a little shaky. He led me away for a hot, sweet cup of tea. </p> <p>That's when I began to feel the impact of what had happened. I did some other interviews later that day but at that moment, cradling my tea in my hands, I was no longer a journalist. At that moment I was just another shocked and frightened passenger.

The show, in which Ms Dickson Wright teams up with friend and farmer Johnny Scott to explore country matters, opened with 2.3m and a 10% share at 8pm. On Saturday night, Parkinson benefited from its move from Friday and the inheritance bequeathed by Casualty. The long-running chat show, whose guests included Ian Botham, Richard Attenborough and Richard Wilson, averaged 6.8m and a 30% share from 9.05pm. The previous week Parkinson had bowed out on Friday night with 5.5m and 25% in the 9.30pm slot. Over on ITV from 9.05pm, customs and excise drama The Knock returned with the first of four 90-minute stories. The drama, which featured a guest appearance by Rik Mayall, averaged 6.6m and a 30% share. Earlier in the evening, BBC1's Star for a Night Final was neck and neck with longer established ITV makeover show Stars in their Eyes, before pulling ahead of You've Been Framed in its final half-hour. The BBC1 show, fronted by former docu-soap star Jane McDonald, averaged 7.5m and a 36% share from 6.45-8.05pm. Later on the Star for a Night Result show had 6.8m - a 32% share - following on from Parkinson at 9.55-10.15pm.",

      "byline": "Jonathan Romney",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>What is it that gets a film-maker accepted as an international exemplar of hipness? It may be something as simple as the habit of wearing sunglasses morning, noon and night (at least, when the press is present), though I suspect the quietly-spoken Wong Kar-Wai just likes something to hide behind. The Hong Kong director's hipster reputation really derives from his mid-90s films Chungking Express and Fallen Angels - fast-moving, fragmented stories about moody hitmen, zany gamines and mystery vamps, shot on the hoof in neon-steeped urban locations and imbued with a flavour of lovelorn melancholy. </p> <p>But if the exuberance of those films could be misread as surface stylishness, his latest film moves into what you might call deep style. In the Mood for Love is indeed moody and amorous, and takes the art of mise en sc\u00e8ne to rich new levels: you could swoon just at the heat of the wallpaper colours. Wong has previously claimed that his life is too boring for any of his films to be autobiographical. But this 1960s-set love story has more of himself than usual. Its setting is the Hong Kong of Wong's childhood; his family moved there from Shanghai in 1963, when he was five, and lived in the cosmopolitan district of Tsimshatsui, where his father ran a nightclub. \"This film is more personal to me,\" he says. \"It's about a certain period in our life, a certain lifestyle or manner that is lost already.\" </p> <p>In the Mood for Love is also about history: starting in 1962, it ends with a newsreel of General de Gaulle in Cambodia four years later. What seems to be a sultry romantic vignette gestures at a wider picture. \"We ended in 1966. That was a critical moment in Hong Kong history. There was the Cultural Revolution in China, and in Hong Kong we had the anti-colonial riots. Those people who had moved from China to Hong Kong since 1949 had to realise that the place is easily influenced by the changes in China.\" </p> <p>Much of the work was a matter of historical reconstruction: shooting partly in Hong Kong, partly in Bangkok, Wong and his regular designer William Chang used real buildings, but made the interiors look like highly stylised sets. \"The hotel is actually a British army hospital - you know, in the good old days,\" says Wong, and you can't quite gauge how much nostalgia or irony there is in that phrase. \"I liked that hotel: architecturally it was wonderful. But it's gone now.\" </p> <p>Wong's new film may come as a shock to fans of his jazzier style, but then his work has always switched from mood to mood. A former genre screenwriter, Wong got into directing in 1988 with As Tears Go By, a straight cop story with MTV flourishes. But his follow-up, Days of Being Wild, established him as a master of mood: it was an almost dream-like study, with a dense atmosphere of rain, mildew and melancholy. </p> <p>Wong Kar-Wai is renowned for filming as circumstances allow - Chungking Express, his next film, was famously shot in 1994 around Hong Kong with hand-held cameras. His methods, especially his aversion to fixed scripts, bring their own problems: \"It's not easy. We can only work with people who know us very well and understand us.\" </p> <p>\"Us\" includes his collaborators, regular designer William Chang and mercurial cameraman Chris Doyle. Wong has described their collaboration as being like a jazz band jamming, and he makes it sound remarkably easy: \"I tell William, 'She's working in a shipping office,' and he'll do it. We don't have to discuss it; he doesn't have to show me a draft or anything. Then Chris will walk in, I'll say it's a day scene, and he'll light the set. Then I'll come in and see how it looks, we make some adjustments, and that's it.\" </p> <p>People, he believes, misunderstand his methods: \"Sometimes they think the way we work is very stylish and romantic, but actually it's the way we can survive and make the films. We can work with the things that we get, but not the things we wish we had. A lot of young film-makers say, 'OK, we'll make a film the Wong Kar-Wai way.' They think this is the way to make films, but I tell them that we work very hard - it's not a party.\" </p> <p>Despite offers from Hollywood, Wong is sticking with his Asian stories. He is currently working on a film called 2046, the title referring to the 50th year after the handover of Hong Kong. \"We want to explore how many things will be unchanged in our life. It is not so much science fiction - don't expect something like The Matrix. I think it will be more like an opera. We started with three stories, and I'm very curious about how many stories will be left in there at the end of the film.\"Elsewhere, Wong has intimated that 2046 and In the Mood for Love are, in some sense, both parts of the same film. And the latter, he admits, might not have been quite the same film had he not already been working on 2046. </p> <p>Wong's projects have a habit of losing branches: a whole segment of his last film, Happy Together, about a nightclub singer, was lost in cutting, while a projected continuation of Days of Being Wild exists only in palimpsest, in the otherwise inexplicable appearance of a new character at the end of the film. Equally, new projects sprout fully-formed out of old ones. In the Mood for Love started as a 30-minute episode of an intended portmanteau film, which itself was a rethink of something else. Wong had planned a feature called Summer in Beijing, to be shot in mainland China, but the Chinese government refused a permit. \"I still wanted to make a film called Summer in Beijing, but in Macao, in a restaurant called Beijing. We called the project Three Stories About Food. And one of the stories became In the Mood for Love.\" </p> <p>There is often a sense that Wong's films refer to each other, subliminally or otherwise: the heroine of In the Mood for Love, Wong says, both is and isn't an older version of the ingenue soda-pop vendor played by the same actress, Maggie Cheung, in Days of Being Wild. \"I wanted to give Maggie some references about Hong Kong in the old days. The only reference she had in her mind was her mother. One day I told her, 'OK, don't let the dresses or the look or the behaviour make you uneasy. You didn't have any problems in Days of Being Wild [set in 1960].' She said, 'No, because I think that girl is me.' I said, 'OK, why don't we consider this character as the same girl? Ten years later you marry somebody and you find your husband is cheating on you. Can you consider this as Days of Being Wild Part 2? It's a sequel.' Somehow it worked.\" </p> <p>\"The way we make films is very organic - it's not a product. It's not like saying, 'OK, we've finished a film and a film should be like this for ever.' I think some day we can go back and we can grow something out of it.\" Projects cross-pollinate and, like collapsed trees in a forest feeding new growth, one film seems to fall through just so that others can sprout off it. Judging from In the Mood for Love, Wong Kar-Wai's garden of forking paths may become even richer and denser. </p> <p>\u0095 In the Mood for Love is released on October 27.</p>",

It may be something as simple as the habit of wearing sunglasses morning, noon and night (at least, when the press is present), though I suspect the quietly-spoken Wong Kar-Wai just likes something to hide behind. The Hong Kong director's hipster reputation really derives from his mid-90s films Chungking Express and Fallen Angels - fast-moving, fragmented stories about moody hitmen, zany gamines and mystery vamps, shot on the hoof in neon-steeped urban locations and imbued with a flavour of lovelorn melancholy. But if the exuberance of those films could be misread as surface stylishness, his latest film moves into what you might call deep style. In the Mood for Love is indeed moody and amorous, and takes the art of mise en sc\u00e8ne to rich new levels: you could swoon just at the heat of the wallpaper colours. Wong has previously claimed that his life is too boring for any of his films to be autobiographical. But this 1960s-set love story has more of himself than usual. Its setting is the Hong Kong of Wong's childhood; his family moved there from Shanghai in 1963, when he was five, and lived in the cosmopolitan district of Tsimshatsui, where his father ran a nightclub. \"This film is more personal to me,\" he says. \"It's about a certain period in our life, a certain lifestyle or manner that is lost already.\" In the Mood for Love is also about history: starting in 1962, it ends with a newsreel of General de Gaulle in Cambodia four years later. What seems to be a sultry romantic vignette gestures at a wider picture. \"We ended in 1966. That was a critical moment in Hong Kong history. There was the Cultural Revolution in China, and in Hong Kong we had the anti-colonial riots. Those people who had moved from China to Hong Kong since 1949 had to realise that the place is easily influenced by the changes in China.\" Much of the work was a matter of historical reconstruction: shooting partly in Hong Kong, partly in Bangkok, Wong and his regular designer William Chang used real buildings, but made the interiors look like highly stylised sets. \"The hotel is actually a British army hospital - you know, in the good old days,\" says Wong, and you can't quite gauge how much nostalgia or irony there is in that phrase. \"I liked that hotel: architecturally it was wonderful. But it's gone now.\" Wong's new film may come as a shock to fans of his jazzier style, but then his work has always switched from mood to mood. A former genre screenwriter, Wong got into directing in 1988 with As Tears Go By, a straight cop story with MTV flourishes. But his follow-up, Days of Being Wild, established him as a master of mood: it was an almost dream-like study, with a dense atmosphere of rain, mildew and melancholy. Wong Kar-Wai is renowned for filming as circumstances allow - Chungking Express, his next film, was famously shot in 1994 around Hong Kong with hand-held cameras. His methods, especially his aversion to fixed scripts, bring their own problems: \"It's not easy. We can only work with people who know us very well and understand us.\" \"Us\" includes his collaborators, regular designer William Chang and mercurial cameraman Chris Doyle. Wong has described their collaboration as being like a jazz band jamming, and he makes it sound remarkably easy: \"I tell William, 'She's working in a shipping office,' and he'll do it. We don't have to discuss it; he doesn't have to show me a draft or anything. Then Chris will walk in, I'll say it's a day scene, and he'll light the set. Then I'll come in and see how it looks, we make some adjustments, and that's it.\" People, he believes, misunderstand his methods: \"Sometimes they think the way we work is very stylish and romantic, but actually it's the way we can survive and make the films. We can work with the things that we get, but not the things we wish we had. A lot of young film-makers say, 'OK, we'll make a film the Wong Kar-Wai way.' They think this is the way to make films, but I tell them that we work very hard - it's not a party.\" Despite offers from Hollywood, Wong is sticking with his Asian stories. He is currently working on a film called 2046, the title referring to the 50th year after the handover of Hong Kong. \"We want to explore how many things will be unchanged in our life. It is not so much science fiction - don't expect something like The Matrix. I think it will be more like an opera. We started with three stories, and I'm very curious about how many stories will be left in there at the end of the film.\"Elsewhere, Wong has intimated that 2046 and In the Mood for Love are, in some sense, both parts of the same film. And the latter, he admits, might not have been quite the same film had he not already been working on 2046. Wong's projects have a habit of losing branches: a whole segment of his last film, Happy Together, about a nightclub singer, was lost in cutting, while a projected continuation of Days of Being Wild exists only in palimpsest, in the otherwise inexplicable appearance of a new character at the end of the film. Equally, new projects sprout fully-formed out of old ones. In the Mood for Love started as a 30-minute episode of an intended portmanteau film, which itself was a rethink of something else. Wong had planned a feature called Summer in Beijing, to be shot in mainland China, but the Chinese government refused a permit. \"I still wanted to make a film called Summer in Beijing, but in Macao, in a restaurant called Beijing. We called the project Three Stories About Food. And one of the stories became In the Mood for Love.\" There is often a sense that Wong's films refer to each other, subliminally or otherwise: the heroine of In the Mood for Love, Wong says, both is and isn't an older version of the ingenue soda-pop vendor played by the same actress, Maggie Cheung, in Days of Being Wild. \"I wanted to give Maggie some references about Hong Kong in the old days. The only reference she had in her mind was her mother. One day I told her, 'OK, don't let the dresses or the look or the behaviour make you uneasy. You didn't have any problems in Days of Being Wild [set in 1960].' She said, 'No, because I think that girl is me.' I said, 'OK, why don't we consider this character as the same girl? Ten years later you marry somebody and you find your husband is cheating on you. Can you consider this as Days of Being Wild Part 2? It's a sequel.' Somehow it worked.\" \"The way we make films is very organic - it's not a product. It's not like saying, 'OK, we've finished a film and a film should be like this for ever.' I think some day we can go back and we can grow something out of it.\" Projects cross-pollinate and, like collapsed trees in a forest feeding new growth, one film seems to fall through just so that others can sprout off it. Judging from In the Mood for Love, Wong Kar-Wai's garden of forking paths may become even richer and denser. \u0095 In the Mood for Love is released on October 27.",

It is thought unlikely that the prolific Scottish-born artist will recover, leaving his family - he has three daughters by his former wife Freda Elliott - to decide whether to keep him alive or to allow him to pass away. Sir Eduardo, 76, collapsed at the end of August in Chelsea, west London. Best known for his sculptures, Paolozzi was born to Italian parents in Edinburgh, where he attended the city's School of Art and then the Slade school in London before embarking on a career that has seen his bold, geometric interpretations of human forms and machinery installed in important sites across London and the UK. In London large Paolozzis can be seen outside Euston station, on the forecourt of the British Library, inside the Queen Elizabeth II conference centre, and outside the British Museum and the Science Museum. He created the cast-aluminum doors at Glasgow's Hunterian gallery and the Dean gallery in Edinburgh is dedicated to his work. Perhaps his most frequently viewed works are the glass mosaics at Tottenham Court Road tube station. His work also featured on a stamp in 1999 as part of a millennium collection.

A 19-year-old woman was arrested in connection with the abduction after an overnight search led detectives to a hotel where the infant was found safe and well, said a spokesman for the Garda Siochana, the Irish police force. Meanwhile, managers at Cork's Erinville Hospital were today reviewing security arrangements, which had alerted staff to the baby's abduction but failed to stop a woman fleeing the hospital grounds with the child. The parents, Brigid and John O'Brien, from Ballyporeen, Co Tipperary, were said to be \"overjoyed\" at the return of their son, who was just eight hours old when he was snatched from the second floor nursery of the hospital. A security tag on the infant's foot triggered a security alarm as he was being carried down the stairs by a woman. But security staff at the hospital could only watch as the kidnapper ran to a waiting red Toyota Corolla, which was then driven off the wrong way along a one-way street. Detectives, armed with the registration number of the vehicle and footage from closed circuit television cameras at the hospital, believed they knew the identity of the woman and continued searching throughout the night. A vehicle was spotted in a hotel car park in Midleton, about 10 miles from Cork, and the baby, a woman and two girls, said to be aged 12 and 14, were found booked into a room. After a medical examination, the infant was taken by ambulance back to the hospital, where police said he needed specialist treatment, and was reunited with his parents, who also have two daughters. Gerry O'Dwyer, deputy general manager of the southern health board, said security measures at the hospital were now being reviewed. \"Obviously there are lessons in it for everybody, and we will be working very closely with the Gardai to ensure that we have a more comprehensive system in place,\" he said.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><em>Roy McLaren, 59, has been head groundsman at Worcestershire for 18 years</em></p> <p>\"We have a lot of work to do at the end of the season. We have to scarify the pitch - which means get all the rubbish out of the top of the square before we put new grass seed in. Then we have to spike it. We use a hydrocorer - which drives spikes in about four inches - to aerate it and get water and air down to the roots. And then we top-dress it, that is put new soil on top. We have used Surrey loam since 1991. </p> <p>\"I wasn't particularly pleased with the square this year. We had real problems with the weather. New Road is on a flood plain and every time the river floods the water just percolates across the ground. The ground underneath the square is the wettest in the country by quite a long way. We managed to get the pitches quite firm but we never got them dry. We're looking at putting a ring drain round the square to try and control the water table. </p> <p>\"It's a little bit more relaxed in the winter than during the summer when we're hitting deadlines all the time: 11am, 1.15, tea, and so on. We try to keep the ground open all year as a tourist attraction. We leave all the gates open and the seats out until the first flood. We get people from all over the world coming over - especially Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. People used to buy memorial benches for relatives (though they don't so much now because of the cost), and they are always coming up and saying that their Uncle Fred died in 1973, could I show them where his bench is. About 95% of the benches are in the Ladies Pavilion so I can usually push people in roughly the right direction. </p> <p>\"Because there is more cricket played during the season we do more maintenance work during the winter. The team consists of myself, three assistant groundsmen and two juniors. We are working 8-4.30 at the moment though in the summer it can be half-six to half-ten - the floodlit games make for a very, very long day. </p> <p>\"At the moment I've got one young man taking branches off to be burnt, two lads trimming the big willow hedges that surround the ground, another putting the grass seed in, and I'm repairing the flagpole. But we are always within shouting distance of each other. In the summer you always get members chatting to you, asking you what you are doing and trying to ensure that you don't alter anything.</p> <p>\"You've got to be a cricket fan to do this job - if you weren't you'd go spare. My wife didn't like it much when I played, though as soon as our son started she became a very big fan. I've been a groundsman since I was 15. I left school to become a cricketer, but there were two other quick bowlers at Edgbaston. They shot up to six foot three, while I just shot out to 18 stone. Then I worked in Birmingham at the Lucas's car factory ground until the depression came in the car business. They used to employ 38,000 people there. Now it's probably about 2000. After they made me redundant I managed to get a job here. </p> <p>\"I like making videos with my camcorder if I have a bit of spare time. I've made a couple to help the ECB with their courses which they run in conjunction with the institute of groundsmanship. I teach a bit as well. </p> <p>\"I also enjoy reading, especially Alistair McLean, Clive Cussler and Dick Francis. Also the odd cricket book like Ian Botham's, Basil D'Oliveira's or Dickie Bird's. I'm not into a lot of analysis of the game though. </p> <p>\"My favourite current Worcester player is Graeme Hick. I saw him as a 16-year-old and to watch him get his 100th 100 here while Vikram Solanki got his first 100 at the other end was fantastic. Tom Graveney walked out with a glass of champagne when he did it, and it was a beautiful day. Worcester have won Championships and Sunday Leagues but that was my favourite moment.

      "bodyText": "Roy McLaren, 59, has been head groundsman at Worcestershire for 18 years \"We have a lot of work to do at the end of the season. We have to scarify the pitch - which means get all the rubbish out of the top of the square before we put new grass seed in. Then we have to spike it. We use a hydrocorer - which drives spikes in about four inches - to aerate it and get water and air down to the roots. And then we top-dress it, that is put new soil on top. We have used Surrey loam since 1991. \"I wasn't particularly pleased with the square this year. We had real problems with the weather. New Road is on a flood plain and every time the river floods the water just percolates across the ground. The ground underneath the square is the wettest in the country by quite a long way. We managed to get the pitches quite firm but we never got them dry. We're looking at putting a ring drain round the square to try and control the water table. \"It's a little bit more relaxed in the winter than during the summer when we're hitting deadlines all the time: 11am, 1.15, tea, and so on. We try to keep the ground open all year as a tourist attraction. We leave all the gates open and the seats out until the first flood. We get people from all over the world coming over - especially Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. People used to buy memorial benches for relatives (though they don't so much now because of the cost), and they are always coming up and saying that their Uncle Fred died in 1973, could I show them where his bench is. About 95% of the benches are in the Ladies Pavilion so I can usually push people in roughly the right direction. \"Because there is more cricket played during the season we do more maintenance work during the winter. The team consists of myself, three assistant groundsmen and two juniors. We are working 8-4.30 at the moment though in the summer it can be half-six to half-ten - the floodlit games make for a very, very long day. \"At the moment I've got one young man taking branches off to be burnt, two lads trimming the big willow hedges that surround the ground, another putting the grass seed in, and I'm repairing the flagpole. But we are always within shouting distance of each other. In the summer you always get members chatting to you, asking you what you are doing and trying to ensure that you don't alter anything. \"You've got to be a cricket fan to do this job - if you weren't you'd go spare. My wife didn't like it much when I played, though as soon as our son started she became a very big fan. I've been a groundsman since I was 15. I left school to become a cricketer, but there were two other quick bowlers at Edgbaston. They shot up to six foot three, while I just shot out to 18 stone. Then I worked in Birmingham at the Lucas's car factory ground until the depression came in the car business. They used to employ 38,000 people there. Now it's probably about 2000. After they made me redundant I managed to get a job here. \"I like making videos with my camcorder if I have a bit of spare time. I've made a couple to help the ECB with their courses which they run in conjunction with the institute of groundsmanship. I teach a bit as well. \"I also enjoy reading, especially Alistair McLean, Clive Cussler and Dick Francis. Also the odd cricket book like Ian Botham's, Basil D'Oliveira's or Dickie Bird's. I'm not into a lot of analysis of the game though. \"My favourite current Worcester player is Graeme Hick. I saw him as a 16-year-old and to watch him get his 100th 100 here while Vikram Solanki got his first 100 at the other end was fantastic. Tom Graveney walked out with a glass of champagne when he did it, and it was a beautiful day. Worcester have won Championships and Sunday Leagues but that was my favourite moment. It was just so essentially Worcestershire. The word went around the town that Graeme was going to do it and people just kept coming in until, by four o'clock, it was practically full. It was just one of those things which will always stay with me. \"I'm having a week off this week - I'm going on a fly-cruise to Jersey with my wife Diane. We last went to the Channel Islands just after we got married in 1963, so it will be lovely.\" Roy McLaren was talking to Tanya Aldred Previous My Winters James Kirtley, the Sussex seamer who's waiting for the call-up Peter Such, the Essex and England offspinner who is preparing for his benefit year Mark Wagh, the Warwickshire batsman who went to Venice Reg May, the ex-meteorologist who now scores for Cambridge",

I was a trainee reporter on the Cambridge Evening News and about to set off on my first \"foreign\". </p> <p>\"Any advice, boss?\" I asked. </p> <p>\"Yes. Sharpen your pencil, take an extra notebook and make sure you've got some change for the 'phone. Now get out of here before I change my mind!\" It was sophisticated stuff in those days. </p> <p>Ten years on I was a television correspondent with BBC TV News, heading for South and Central America with Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington. Among my travelling companions was ITN correspondent Trevor Macdonald. </p> <p>In those days Trevor and I shot our rival reports on film and recorded voice tracks on tape. The film cans were bundled into a well marked 'onion bag' and dispatched on the next flight to London: there was a fair chance they would arrive in time to appear on the following evening's news. Exhausted correspondents and camera crews then retired to a nearby beach or bar to consider the next story. </p> <p>My crew and I were diverted to the Texas coast to cover Hurricane Allen. But before we could broadcast the amazing footage, we had to fly the length of the US to the BBC New York Bureau, the nearest place we could process and edit the film. </p> <p>By 1990 I was with ITN reporting on the Gulf War. Mobile satellite dishes were now starting to transform the world of the television journalist. \"Fly-away\" dishes weren't quite the fairy-winged technological marvels they sounded, as many a TV engineer with back problems will testify, but at least they were portable (just). With up-links in Baghdad and the Saudi Arabian city of Dhahran, we found ourselves \"going live\" more than ever before. News picture-gathering was also more immediate with the advent of video cameras. Now tapes could be edited without delay - or put straight to air. The television correspondent was under increasing pressure to go live at a moment's notice. </p> <p>As we moved over the border into Kuwait with the liberation forces, we had a sight of things to come. The first and only satellite link out of Kuwait City in those early hours was a cunning contrivance devised by a CBS camera crew. They had strapped and roped a dish on to an old flatbed truck and driven it across the desert from Saudi. Peter Sharp and I gratefully used it to broadcast the first live picture reports on ITN. What viewers didn't see was the CBS rag-and-bone-man's jalopy that was to fire the imagination of television engineers. </p> <p>Nearly a decade later I was to see the benefits first-hand. Now a Sky News correspondent, I was waiting on the Macedonian border as the first Nato troops rolled into Kosovo - a province cut off from the world's view for many months. Within 15 minutes I was broadcasting live from inside Kosovo. The Yugoslav forces had left only moments before; KLA soldiers emerged from the hills to claim the villages; Gurkha infantrymen patrolled the streets searching out booby-traps; and British tanks trundled noisily by. I found bloodstains barely dry, hastily discarded family photographs, the wreckage of homes and lives - all live. By now we were armed with custom-made satellite trucks. Sky News boss Nick Pollard, had sent out four. So, I and my fellow correspondents - Keith Graves, David Chater and Andrew Wilson - were able to report the progress of the Nato peace-keeping force live all the way to Pristina while, from another satellite dish in the Kosovan capital, Tim Marshall charted the Yugoslav retreat as we headed towards him. </p> <p>The speed, the flexibility and the immediacy of the coverage were at a level we had not been technically capable of producing before. </p> <p>If you're wondering what's next, I'm worryingly reminded of a spoof I taped a few years back to mark Pollard's departure as executive editor of News at Ten. I was wandering round South Africa looking like a techno one-man-band with a digicam on one shoulder, a microphone strapped to my chest, an edit pack in hand and a dustbin lid - loosely representing a mini-dish - taped to my back. \"The TV Correspondent of the Future\" was the title. It's frighteningly close to coming true. </p> <p>As the digital technology improves, so too does the TV news broadcaster's mobility and ability to reach the stories once deemed off the beaten track. On 24-hour rolling news channels live, breaking stories are the priority. Get there first, tell the story live, stay with the drama. </p> <p>Mobile satellite trucks have enabled us to do that in Britain. But as the technology brings compression and condensing, it may soon be possible, thanks to mini satellite dishes, minicams and mini-edit packs, for a two-person team - a correspondent and camera operator/editor/engineer - to operate from the remotest corners of the globe. </p> <p>The pros and cons of the broadcast news revolution? On the whole I think they are mainly pluses. On rolling news channels, a TV correspondent can tell his or her story as never before. The equipment allows them to go live from almost anywhere. They can move as and when the focus of the story shifts, updating it whenever there's something to add and turning round video pictures without delay. </p> <p>But the immediacy also puts today's correspondent under a range of new pressures. There's precious little time to stop, think and prepare. At last week's Hatfield rail crash, some of my colleagues admitted they were often wired up at a live position doing two-way reports with the studio hour after hour. This left them little time to go news and picture gathering. </p> <p>It's a familiar story across the industry. Field producers with each mobile team now play an important role as fact finders for on-air correspondents. Without good back-up there's always the danger of speaking out of necessity rather than from authority. </p> <p>What this means is that there's a greater premium than ever on good journalism - the simple, basic tools of the trade.

This has to happen before the Commons can move on to its proper business. <p><b>Who are the candidates? </b> <br> Officially, there are no candidates. There is a tradition that MPs only accept the post with great reluctance - in fact, whoever is chosen will have to be symbolically dragged to the Speaker's chair by other MPs. In reality, of course, the post is much sought-after. Twelve MPs have made it clear that they would like to be chosen (a 13th dropped out recently). Among them, four or five are thought to have some chance of coming out on top. </p> <p><b>Is this the usual number of candidates? </b> <br> No. In fact there is rarely a contest for the job at all. Last time, in 1992, two MPs put their names forward, but one, Sir Peter Brooke, was convincingly beaten by the other, Betty Boothroyd. Before that, there has not been a contested election in living memory: a consensus candidate has always emerged. So this election will see the Commons venture onto virgin territory, albeit with a very traditional electoral system.</p> <p><b>What is this system? </b> <br> It is a version of the formal process used in parliamentary debates. By general consent, the longest-serving member of the House takes the chair - in this case (as in the last election for Speaker) it will be Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister. He has been in the House since 1950 and the new Speaker will be the eighth he has served under. </p> <p><b>And what happens? </b> <br> Sir Edward will propose a motion, naming a candidate for the job - likely to be Sir Alan Haselhurst, a current deputy speaker. MPs will debate this motion for a few minutes and Sir Edward will then call for amendments to it, replacing the first candidate's name with another. This is where the most likely victor, Michael Martin, is likely to come in. MPs will then vote on the amendment, and, assuming it is passed, the initial candidate will drop out of the contest and the second candidate's name will be written into the motion. MPs are then free to propose another amendment, pitting the second candidate against a third. If this is passed, the second candidate, too, drops out and a fourth steps forward. The process continues until an amendment is defeated, the motion passed and the winner dragged to the Speaker's chair protesting their \"reluctance\" to take the job.</p> <p><b>So the election could take hours? </b> <br> Except that in reality the second candidate is likely to be Michael Martin, who will probably win when an amendment is proposed against his name. As a result, nine of the MPs who have said they are candidates will probably never get the chance to have their names put to a vote.</p> <p><b>This sounds unfair. Is it really the best system? </b> <br> Many MPs agree that a much fairer system should be used. As things stand, Sir Edward Heath has great power, since he determines the order in which candidates are voted upon. Many MPs, led by Tony Benn, have asked Sir Edward to bring in a two-stage election. The first stage would see MPs vote on all the candidates. The two names that come top in this election would then be put to a second vote, and the winner given the job. Sir Edward, though, has shown no sign of agreeing to this, so the traditional system will almost certainly be used.</p> <p><b>How do MPs decide whom to support? </b> <br> All sorts of competing pressures determine how members vote. One pressure is party. There is no formal whip in the election, so MPs are free to support candidates from other parties (as many Tories did in 1992 when they backed Betty Boothroyd, a Labour MP), but Labour's huge majority means that a Labour candidate must have an advantage. Another pressure comes from the informal networks of support that the candidates have built up: this is Michael Martin's big advantage. Yet another influence may be the short statements that some candidates have issued, describing their intentions if elected. And a fourth source of pressure is the government. Tony Blair is thought to favour either Menzies Campbell or Sir George Young. But perversely, this may deter MPs from backing them. They see the election of a Speaker as an assertion of the Common's independence from the government. </p> <p><b>Will there be hustings? </b> <br> Three hours before the vote begins, some MPs have organised an informal hustings for the candidates to put their case for election. Each will be allowed to speak for 10 minutes. But not all the candidates plan to attend. Three of the front-runners, including the likely victor Michael Martin, may stay away.</p>",

She told MPs of her decision when the Commons last met, in July, and now, as the House returns after its long summer break, it is time to choose her successor, who will be the 152nd Speaker. This has to happen before the Commons can move on to its proper business. <p><b>Who are the candidates? </b> <br> Officially, there are no candidates. There is a tradition that MPs only accept the post with great reluctance - in fact, whoever is chosen will have to be symbolically dragged to the Speaker's chair by other MPs. In reality, of course, the post is much sought-after. Twelve MPs have made it clear that they would like to be chosen (a thirteenth dropped out recently). Among them, four or five are thought to have some chance of coming out on top. </p> <p><b>Is this the usual number of candidates? </b> <br> No. In fact there is rarely a contest for the job at all. Last time, in 1992, two MPs put their names forward, but one, Sir Peter Brooke, was convincingly beaten by the other, Betty Boothroyd. Before that, there has not been a contested election in living memory: a consensus candidate has always emerged. So this election will see the Commons venture onto virgin territory, albeit with a very traditional electoral system.</p> <p><b>What is this system? </b> <br> It is a version of the formal process used in parliamentary debates. By general consent, the longest-serving member of the House takes the chair - in this case (as in the last election for Speaker) it will be Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister. He has been in the House since 1950 and the new Speaker will be the eighth he has served under. </p> <p><b>And what happens? </b> <br> Sir Edward will propose a motion, naming a candidate for the job - likely to be Sir Alan Haselhurst, a current deputy speaker. MPs will debate this motion for a few minutes and Sir Edward will then call for amendments to it, replacing the first candidate's name with another. This is where the most likely victor, Michael Martin, is likely to come in. MPs will then vote on the amendment, and, assuming it is passed, the initial candidate will drop out of the contest and the second candidate's name will be written into the motion. MPs are then free to propose another amendment, pitting the second candidate against a third. If this is passed, the second candidate, too, drops out and a fourth steps forward. The process continues until an amendment is defeated, the motion passed and the winner dragged to the Speaker's chair protesting their \"reluctance\" to take the job.</p> <p><b>So the election could take hours? </b> <br> Except that in reality the second candidate is likely to be Michael Martin, who will probably win when an amendment is proposed against his name. As a result, nine of the MPs who have said they are candidates will probably never get the chance to have their names put to a vote.</p> <p><b>This sounds unfair. Is it really the best system? </b> <br> Many MPs agree that a much fairer system should be used. As things stand, Sir Edward Heath has great power, since he determines the order in which candidates are voted upon. Many MPs, led by Tony Benn, have asked Sir Edward to bring in a two-stage election. The first stage would see MPs vote on all the candidates. The two names that come top in this election would then be put to a second vote, and the winner given the job. Sir Edward, though, has shown no sign of agreeing to this, so the traditional system will almost certainly be used.</p> <p><b>How do MPs decide whom to support? </b> <br> All sorts of competing pressures determine how members vote. One pressure is party. There is no formal whip in the election, so MPs are free to support candidates from other parties (as many Tories did in 1992 when they backed Betty Boothroyd, a Labour MP), but Labour's huge majority means that a Labour candidate must have an advantage. Another pressure comes from the informal networks of support that the candidates have built up: this is Michael Martin's big advantage. Yet another influence may be the short statements that some candidates have issued, describing their intentions if elected. And a fourth source of pressure is the government. Tony Blair is thought to favour either Menzies Campbell or Sir George Young. But perversely, this may deter MPs from backing them. They see the election of a Speaker as an assertion of the Common's independence from the government. </p> <p><b>Will there be hustings? </b> <br> Three hours before the vote begins, some MPs have organised an informal hustings for the candidates to put their case for election. Each will be allowed to speak for 10 minutes. But not all the candidates plan to attend. Three of the front-runners, including the likely victor Michael Martin, may stay away.</p>",

The inquiries into the paediatric cardiac unit at the Bristol royal infirmary and a projected fifth terminal at Heathrow will report in the new year, while the investigation into how Harold Shipman was able to murder so many of his patients will begin once parliament has given approval.</p> <p>Under the Blair government public inquiries have undergone a renaissance, being convened to investigate avoidable accidents and public health scandals, most of which took place under a Conservative administration reluctant to focus attention on its failings.</p> <p>But are these investigations a product of political expediency, the last recourse of guilty ministers keen to see uncomfortable questions kicked into the long grass? An expensive and drawn-out way of shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted? Or is the public inquiry a vital democratic tool fulfilling an investigative role on behalf of the public, while providing catharsis and, crucially, answers for families of the bereaved?</p> <p><b>Campaign</b></p> <p>Maria Shortis has first hand experience of the process. Her daughter Jacinta died in 1986 at the Bristol royal infirmary after being born with five heart defects. She received conflicting advice before an operation, which might have allowed Jacinta to live for a number of years, was bodged. As an NHS manager she recognised a flawed management overseeing a low level of surgical skill. Appalled, she began a three year campaign for an inquiry. \"I was outraged by the lack of accountability at Bristol.

      "bodyText": "When Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers makes public his 16 volume report on the BSE crisis this Thursday it will mark the end of a process that began three years ago when Tony Blair, fresh to office, ceded to demands for a full public inquiry into the disease and its link with vCJD. At the inquiry offices in Hercules Road, London, Lord Phillips and his committee have studied more than 3,000 files, received 12,000 items of correspondence, looked at 1,200 witness statements and heard evidence from 333 witnesses at a total cost of \u00a327m. Time consuming, complex and expensive, it is the model of a public inquiry, eight of which are in session. Hearings into the Marchioness river boat accident, the Ladbroke Grove and Southall rail crashes and the Bloody Sunday shootings are ongoing. The inquiries into the paediatric cardiac unit at the Bristol royal infirmary and a projected fifth terminal at Heathrow will report in the new year, while the investigation into how Harold Shipman was able to murder so many of his patients will begin once parliament has given approval. Under the Blair government public inquiries have undergone a renaissance, being convened to investigate avoidable accidents and public health scandals, most of which took place under a Conservative administration reluctant to focus attention on its failings. But are these investigations a product of political expediency, the last recourse of guilty ministers keen to see uncomfortable questions kicked into the long grass? An expensive and drawn-out way of shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted? Or is the public inquiry a vital democratic tool fulfilling an investigative role on behalf of the public, while providing catharsis and, crucially, answers for families of the bereaved? Campaign Maria Shortis has first hand experience of the process. Her daughter Jacinta died in 1986 at the Bristol royal infirmary after being born with five heart defects. She received conflicting advice before an operation, which might have allowed Jacinta to live for a number of years, was bodged. As an NHS manager she recognised a flawed management overseeing a low level of surgical skill. Appalled, she began a three year campaign for an inquiry. \"I was outraged by the lack of accountability at Bristol. I had seen incompetence myself but never at a clinical level where lives were being wasted. Parents were told it was the leading paediatric cardiac care unit in the country, yet within the medical profession people said 'don't go anywhere near Bristol'. It was obscene.\" The inquiry, chaired by Ian Kennedy, set new standards in openness with daily transcripts appearing on the internet. But Mrs Shortis condemns the length of time it took successive governments to respond. \"We only got an inquiry because I found inside information about the level of incompetence. I introduced journalists to families until the story could not be ignored. Only then did government act,\" she said. For the families, the process has been constructive, says Mrs Shortis, who founded the Campaign for Dialogue and Clinical Accountability (CDCA), which seeks to promote openness about the risks associated with operations. Phil Scraton, head of the Centre for Studies in Crime and Social Justice at Edge Hill University College, has studied some of the most emotive public inquiries of recent years, including those into the Strangeways prison riots, Ashworth hospital, Hillsborough, the Bradford fire, Dunblane and the Marchioness. He is a supporter of public inquiries but proposes wide reforms. \"There are problems,\" Professor Scraton said. \"The decision to hold an inquiry, who chairs it, the remit, rules of engagement, selection of civil servants and interested parties can all be shaped by political expediency and opportunism. \"This leads to inconsistency. Why do some disasters get public inquiries when others don't? There is no compulsion to implement report recommendations. It's at this stage that the requirements of government bump into the demands of powerful commercial lobbies.\" An example is the Clapham rail inquiry, chaired by Lord Hidden, which recommended in 1989 that automatic train protection be installed on the rail network within five years. This was shelved on the grounds of cost at privatisation in 1994. Relatives of those who died in the Paddington rail crash last year maintain ATP would have prevented the crash.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair told Paddy Ashdown that he would back reform of the electoral system - and put Liberal Democrats in his government, it was reported today. Ahead of a serialisation of the former Liberal Democrat leader's diaries in the Times beginning tomorrow, the paper reported today that Mr Blair had extensive discussions with Mr Ashdown about the extent of possible cooperation between the two parties while Labour was still in opposition. Mr Blair is said to have told Mr Ashdown on January 14 1997 that he had become convinced of the need for electoral reform in Britain. The diaries suggest that Mr Blair wanted Liberal Democrats in his administration regardless of whether he won a working majority. In addition to Mr Ashdown, Liberal Democrat MPs Menzies Campbell and Alan Beith were earmarked for places in the cabinet if the coalition was formed. But Mr Blair was forced to back off because Gordon Brown opposed the proportional representation electoral system, and there was fierce opposition within the shadow cabinet to the concessions being made to Mr Ashdown's party. Mr Blair even floated the idea of a merger of the two parties, though that was quickly stamped on by senior figures in both camps. The extent of cooperation between the parties was often discussed at Mr Blair's and Mr Ashdown's homes, with their wives part of the discussions. Though actual cooperation has been much more limited since Labour came to power in May 1997, Mr Ashdown said he still believed that, eventually, the two parties would engage in coalition government in England. Mr Ashdown told the paper: \"The project was to design an aircraft which we believed could fly. \"What we have left is a blueprint for it to be done in the future, and two scale models in Wales and Scotland (the coalition pacts for the Welsh assembly and Scottish parliament) are already in the air.\" But Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott made clear that he would not have served in a coalition cabinet involving Mr Ashdown. Asked whether he would have served in a coalition government, Mr Prescott said: \"No. Paddy's dreams... \"Of course we agreed to have meetings. Tony Blair made it absolutely clear we would discuss issues of constitutional matters, and we continued to do that, and we thought that was profitable and right, on major constitutional issues. \"But Paddy wanted to go further, he wants to sit in this little chair in the cabinet and become part of the government. I wouldn't have sat with him, no.\" Asked whether he would consider sitting in cabinet with current Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy in any future coalition, Mr Prescott told BBC1's Breakfast with Frost yesterday: \"Liberals want to do what is in their interests, but it is not in ours. \"You shouldn't do anything like that, and I don't believe in it anyway.\" Mr Ashdown said today that he believed that Mr Blair would have preferred the 1997 election to have produced a Lib-Lab coalition government, rather than the massive Labour majority which resulted. \"I am absolutely convinced he wanted it to happen. I believe that to be the case,\" he said. \"But it isn't a question of whether we would have preferred this coalition or that. \"We would have preferred, and I would still prefer and I believe it will happen, to have a system of government in which parties cooperate and work together in the interests of the nation and the parties of the left make sure we have a better government,\" he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. A coalition government would have been better than Labour alone had proved to be, said Mr Ashdown. \"What a much better government this would have been if it had happened,\" he said. \"It would have been much more pro-European, it would have invested early in health and education and it would have been much more liberal than it actually is.\" Mr Ashdown said he believed that coalition government on the model seen in Edinburgh and Cardiff would \"inevitably\" happen at Westminster. He was convinced that Mr Blair had not abandoned his long-term ambition to achieve a realignment of the left. He said: \"Mr Blair does think large and I think he understands the importance of a long-term vision for the left and the country, and I think that is in the front of his mind still. I don't think this is a vision...which we will easily let go away.\"",

On the structure of the industry, he said it was possible that the number of train operating companies could be reduced from the current 25. He also discussed a likely strengthening of the law on corporate manslaughter.

      "body": "<p>Chances are that you don't read the News of the World. I don't usually buy it myself, though I do still take its sister paper, the Sunday Times, despite everything. Even that causes my more fastidious friends to wrinkle their noses on the grounds that nowadays the once-mighty ST does much more harm to the tone of public life than the old-fashioned News of the Screws. </p> <p>Fair point, but yesterday the Screws took a scalp. Paddy Ashdown's grey eminence, Richard Holme - or \"the Rt Hon Lord Holme of Cheltenham CBE\", as the paper grandly called him - resigned as chairman of the Broadcasting Standards Commission after being caught in adultery at a \u00a3270-a-night hotel in West Sussex. </p> <p>The Gravetye Manor Hotel set in 30 acres of beautiful forest at Turner's Heath, since you ask. And yes the total bill for two nights and the trimmings was \u00a3798, paid by the dapper peer before dropping bit-part actress Nicola Paull off at the station and driving home in his blue Volvo. </p> <p>You didn't want to know those details? Obviously not NoW readership material, let alone the sort of person who would enjoy tracking the 64-year-old father of four to assorted trysts, armed to the teeth with the tools of the interception trade, over what seems to have been weeks, if not months. </p> <p>But does it matter to the rest of us? Who is Richard Holme? And what is the purpose of the News of the World? First Lord Holme. He is one of those people well known to political insiders, certainly in the old Liberal party and the Ashdown Lib Dems, but also to Lib-Lab-minded Labour types who would happily have seen a coalition in 1997 - the near-miss subject of Paddy Ashdown's memoirs out this week. </p> <p>In tandem with building a successful career in the City (he was a director of Prima Europe, a lobbying firm with significant Mandelsonian connections), the former Gurkha officer supported worthy liberal causes and was a useful conduit in the Northern Ireland peace process too. </p> <p>He also fought a series of parliamentary elections from 1964 to 1987, notably in Cheltenham, all of which he lost. No wonder he is a pillar of the Electoral Reform Society and a key player in Ashdown's joint consultative committee with Tony Blair. </p> <p>None of which matters much to Rebekah Wade, the Screws' editor, fresh from her triumph in getting distraught and angry parents to attack neighbours who vaguely resemble paedophiles. To raven-haired Rebekah (as I feel we should describe her) he is a hypocrite who does one thing in public and another in private. \"By day he decides what YOU watch on TV. By night he indulges his fantasies,\" the paper told its readers. </p> <p>Actually the fantasy side sounded reassuringly thin. There were circumstantial suggestions of spanking and a definite allegation by one ex-mistress that the accused indulged in a Wind in the Willows caper in which he played Mr Toad. Sounds good to me, but what do I know? I had not even heard of Skin 2, the \"fetish magazine\" the busy lord is said to read \"occasionally\". </p> <p>The only valid justification for printing all this prurient rubbish would be that Holme was a humbug whose resignation is justified in the public interest. Kevin Keegan resigned as England football coach because he failed. Gerald Corbett, Railtrack's chief executive, offered to go because he failed. Lord Holme, too, may have failed to strike the right balance between quality and market forces in British TV, between standards and the rising tide of sex, violence and generally brain-damaged rubbish either side of the 9pm watershed. </p> <p>But that is not why he has been forced out. He has resigned because a red-top tabloid has caught him being unfaithful to his wife, not a subject he pronounces on at the commission. She is standing by him, which should be enough for most people. Lord Holme is smart enough to know it will not be enough for the tabloids. </p> <p> An old story perhaps, one on which Guardian readers may differ. But they should be reminded that when one of Rupert Murdoch's titles attacks a senior regulator in the television industry it is also promoting, consciously in my experience, the Digger's commercial media interests, here - notably the troubled BSkyB - and around the world. </p> <p>When people like Lord Holme are stalked by Murdoch operatives, one is often led to think how much a bulging file always helps in the big-money battles over ownership and regulation where, contrary to leftwing conspiracy theory, the Blairites have been much less obliging to Mr Murdoch than Margaret Thatcher was in her prime. </p> <p>Even at 69 the old brute remains a formidable manipulator of politicians of every hue, a point on which ex-Murdoch editors are usually more eloquent than incumbents. Mr Murdoch himself has recently married for the third time, evidently finding it as hard as his lordship to practice all that his papers preach. </p> <p>A new wife of child-bearing age is an event of huge importance for the family dynasty, but went largely unreported in his papers. Mr Murdoch has not resigned so far. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:michael.white@guardian. co.uk\">michael.white@guardian. co.uk</a></p>",

Fair point, but yesterday the Screws took a scalp. Paddy Ashdown's grey eminence, Richard Holme - or \"the Rt Hon Lord Holme of Cheltenham CBE\", as the paper grandly called him - resigned as chairman of the Broadcasting Standards Commission after being caught in adultery at a \u00a3270-a-night hotel in West Sussex. The Gravetye Manor Hotel set in 30 acres of beautiful forest at Turner's Heath, since you ask. And yes the total bill for two nights and the trimmings was \u00a3798, paid by the dapper peer before dropping bit-part actress Nicola Paull off at the station and driving home in his blue Volvo. You didn't want to know those details? Obviously not NoW readership material, let alone the sort of person who would enjoy tracking the 64-year-old father of four to assorted trysts, armed to the teeth with the tools of the interception trade, over what seems to have been weeks, if not months. But does it matter to the rest of us? Who is Richard Holme? And what is the purpose of the News of the World? First Lord Holme. He is one of those people well known to political insiders, certainly in the old Liberal party and the Ashdown Lib Dems, but also to Lib-Lab-minded Labour types who would happily have seen a coalition in 1997 - the near-miss subject of Paddy Ashdown's memoirs out this week. In tandem with building a successful career in the City (he was a director of Prima Europe, a lobbying firm with significant Mandelsonian connections), the former Gurkha officer supported worthy liberal causes and was a useful conduit in the Northern Ireland peace process too. He also fought a series of parliamentary elections from 1964 to 1987, notably in Cheltenham, all of which he lost. No wonder he is a pillar of the Electoral Reform Society and a key player in Ashdown's joint consultative committee with Tony Blair. None of which matters much to Rebekah Wade, the Screws' editor, fresh from her triumph in getting distraught and angry parents to attack neighbours who vaguely resemble paedophiles. To raven-haired Rebekah (as I feel we should describe her) he is a hypocrite who does one thing in public and another in private. \"By day he decides what YOU watch on TV. By night he indulges his fantasies,\" the paper told its readers. Actually the fantasy side sounded reassuringly thin. There were circumstantial suggestions of spanking and a definite allegation by one ex-mistress that the accused indulged in a Wind in the Willows caper in which he played Mr Toad. Sounds good to me, but what do I know? I had not even heard of Skin 2, the \"fetish magazine\" the busy lord is said to read \"occasionally\". The only valid justification for printing all this prurient rubbish would be that Holme was a humbug whose resignation is justified in the public interest. Kevin Keegan resigned as England football coach because he failed. Gerald Corbett, Railtrack's chief executive, offered to go because he failed. Lord Holme, too, may have failed to strike the right balance between quality and market forces in British TV, between standards and the rising tide of sex, violence and generally brain-damaged rubbish either side of the 9pm watershed. But that is not why he has been forced out. He has resigned because a red-top tabloid has caught him being unfaithful to his wife, not a subject he pronounces on at the commission. She is standing by him, which should be enough for most people. Lord Holme is smart enough to know it will not be enough for the tabloids. An old story perhaps, one on which Guardian readers may differ. But they should be reminded that when one of Rupert Murdoch's titles attacks a senior regulator in the television industry it is also promoting, consciously in my experience, the Digger's commercial media interests, here - notably the troubled BSkyB - and around the world. When people like Lord Holme are stalked by Murdoch operatives, one is often led to think how much a bulging file always helps in the big-money battles over ownership and regulation where, contrary to leftwing conspiracy theory, the Blairites have been much less obliging to Mr Murdoch than Margaret Thatcher was in her prime. Even at 69 the old brute remains a formidable manipulator of politicians of every hue, a point on which ex-Murdoch editors are usually more eloquent than incumbents. Mr Murdoch himself has recently married for the third time, evidently finding it as hard as his lordship to practice all that his papers preach. A new wife of child-bearing age is an event of huge importance for the family dynasty, but went largely unreported in his papers. Mr Murdoch has not resigned so far. michael.white@guardian. co.uk",

For sustainability embraces all Whitehall departments and councils as it does our domestic lives, housing and how we travel. A senior civil service adviser to the prime minister says government needs more \"stories\" to tell to bring people along with changes in public policy. And a more convincing story is what the prime minister needs to tell on the environment. Major policy statements are forthcoming. When, shortly, Gordon Brown makes his pre-budget statement, he must say something about fuel duty - but surely also about pollution and sustainable quality of life. John Prescott's urban and rural white papers are due and they may go some way to changing policy affecting car and land use - recent hints suggest the Treasury will now permit financial incentives to be offered developers of \"brownfield\" land. Mr Blair's task is to fashion a rhetoric which not only justifies specific measures (including high tax on fuel) but also tries to capture public assent for strong government. If he wants to put clear blue water between Labour and the Tories, here is a gulf. One of the paradoxes of the September protests was how they made the state seem weak; yet only collective action spearheaded by confident government can begin to move us towards sustainability.",

      "body": "<p>At the start of their shifts the police officers insert their Walther P990 pistols into the holsters on their hips and, always operating in pairs with armed back-up vehicles close at hand, begin to patrol the two trouble-hit estates.</p> <p>It is the sort of scene made familiar by films and television shows portraying the fictional lives of police on the mean streets of America. But yesterday it emerged that routine armed foot patrols are now being operated in Nottingham - the first time this has happened on the streets of mainland Britain.</p> <p>The initiative, after a spate of shootings in the city, is seen by many as a worrying move which could spell the beginning of the end for the traditional notion of a bobby on patrol armed only with a truncheon and a pair of handcuffs, and as a further sign of a growing gun culture.</p> <p>Some experts believe that within 10 years the police could be routinely armed, and warn that this in turn will encourage a greater proliferation of weapons among criminals. A senior officer said: \"Arming officers could lead to a dangerous spiral of violence. If the police arm themselves, the criminals will stay a step ahead by obtaining bigger and better weapons. We could be heading for the sort of problems they have in America.\"</p> <p>The Nottinghamshire force decided to set up its so-called \"operation real estate\" earlier this year after a boom in gun related crime on the St Ann's and Meadows estates in Nottingham.</p> <p>In one of the most serious of the 14 shootings this year, a 23-year-old was shot at point-blank range when he answered his front door in St Ann's to five masked gunmen. The bullet smashed into his arm, breaking a bone and leaving him scarred for life. The motive for the attack remains unclear.</p> <p>In other incidents a shotgun was fired into a house as a family, including an eight-year-old girl, slept upstairs and half a dozen rounds were shot through the window of a terraced house in the early hours.</p> <p><b> Deterrent</b><br></p> <p>In February the police force said that armed response vehicles would begin patrolling St Ann's, the Meadows and the city centre, so police marksmen would quickly be on the scene if there were further incidents. It then went a step further and introduced armed foot patrols.</p> <p>Now at least six officers, operating in pairs, patrol the estates and the city centre from dusk to midnight. They are backed up by two armed response vehicles in which Heckler and Koch MP5 rifles are kept. The officers deliberately do not conceal their guns, a tactic intended to instill confidence in the public and act as a visible deterrent to criminals.</p> <p>The estates have a history of drug-related crime; in a recent survey 63% of the 9,200 residents on the Meadows said they were worried about drugs. But police play down the idea that the shootings are part of a turf war between rival gangs of dealers. They believe the shootings are more haphazard - all the more worrying for those who believe that the gun culture is out of control.</p> <p>Since the operation began there have been 150 arrests and 15 firearms recovered. Assistant chief constable Sean Price, who chairs meetings of the strategic command team which reviews the operation weekly, said: \"This is the largest and most sustained police operation we have ever carried out. The shootings are not acceptable and we will not allow a gun culture to develop in Nottingham.\"</p> <p>The Nottinghamshire force was yesterday swift to point out that the patrols have been set up as part of a \"specific operation\", but accepts that it is not wrong to call them routine.</p> <p>Until now on mainland Britain, armed officers have been deployed only for diplomatic duties, to tackle specific incidents such as sieges and armed robberies, or in the light of a particular terrorist threat. Armed officers are routinely to be seen at airports.</p> <p>It is up to chief constables to decide if, and how, they wish to deploy armed officers. They do not have to seek clearance from the government. Indeed, the home officer minister, Charles Clarke, was only told of the move in Nottingham last week, but has now asked for a full briefing.</p> <p>The former deputy constable of Greater Manchester, John Stalker, said that thousands of police officers would be aghast at what was happening in Nottingham.</p> <p>He said: \"I see this as another step along the road to routinely arming police. We are moving towards what is happening in places like America and South Africa and away from our concept of an unarmed police force. For a new breed of senior officer, it's no big deal for police to be armed. It is very worrying indeed.\"</p> <p>Ann Widdecombe, the shadow home secretary, said: \"We have now reached a situation where police officers need to carry guns just to do their job. The decision to issue guns is, of course, a matter for the chief constable, but I am confident the decision was only taken in the face of extreme circumstances.\"</p> <p><b> Crime rise</b><br></p> <p>Other forces are watching developments in Nottingham with great interest. Some have dabbled with the idea of routine patrols in the past. After a spate of shootings in north-west London three years ago, the Metropolitan police launched 24-hour armed vehicle patrols.</p> <p>There is no doubt that gun-related crime is on the increase. Last December it emerged that armed crime was up by 10%, with 13,671 armed offences in the year. Government research has found that one in three criminals under 25 has access to a firearm, and there are thought to be more than 3m firearms illegally in circulation, double the number 10 years ago.</p> <p>Manchester has long had a notorious reputation for gun-related crime. There have been 40 shootings this year alone in the south of the city. Inter-gang violence is one of the main causes. Last month seven people were shot in a three-week period, among them a 16-year-old who was killed when he was gunned down at close range as he rode his mountain bike through a park.</p> <p>Police suspect his murder was in retaliation for the death of a 21-year-old, believed to be a member of a rival gang, who was shot as he rode his bicycle through an alley 10 days before. The gangs allegedly involved, the Pit Bulls and the Longsight Crew, are involved in a turf war.</p> <p>Detective superintendent Tony Porter, head of CID for south Manchester, said: \"They are rivals who are young men who wear their firearms as fashion accessories. Some of them seem to think they are achieving kudos and credibility.\"</p> <p>Drugs underpin all the gangland activity, but Mr Porter said that drugs were not the prime motive for the shootings.</p> <p>Police and community leaders agree that guns are becoming all too common on the streets of Manchester. One youth worker, who asked not be named, said: \"People are not shocked by the shootings any more. They just shrug their shoulders as if they are not bothered by it.\"</p> <p>For now the sight of armed police on the beat in Nottingham is an exciting novelty for the estate's children. Soon, however, it too might be mundane.</p>",

Some experts believe that within 10 years the police could be routinely armed, and warn that this in turn will encourage a greater proliferation of weapons among criminals. A senior officer said: \"Arming officers could lead to a dangerous spiral of violence. If the police arm themselves, the criminals will stay a step ahead by obtaining bigger and better weapons. We could be heading for the sort of problems they have in America.\" The Nottinghamshire force decided to set up its so-called \"operation real estate\" earlier this year after a boom in gun related crime on the St Ann's and Meadows estates in Nottingham. In one of the most serious of the 14 shootings this year, a 23-year-old was shot at point-blank range when he answered his front door in St Ann's to five masked gunmen. The bullet smashed into his arm, breaking a bone and leaving him scarred for life. The motive for the attack remains unclear. In other incidents a shotgun was fired into a house as a family, including an eight-year-old girl, slept upstairs and half a dozen rounds were shot through the window of a terraced house in the early hours. Deterrent In February the police force said that armed response vehicles would begin patrolling St Ann's, the Meadows and the city centre, so police marksmen would quickly be on the scene if there were further incidents. It then went a step further and introduced armed foot patrols. Now at least six officers, operating in pairs, patrol the estates and the city centre from dusk to midnight. They are backed up by two armed response vehicles in which Heckler and Koch MP5 rifles are kept. The officers deliberately do not conceal their guns, a tactic intended to instill confidence in the public and act as a visible deterrent to criminals. The estates have a history of drug-related crime; in a recent survey 63% of the 9,200 residents on the Meadows said they were worried about drugs. But police play down the idea that the shootings are part of a turf war between rival gangs of dealers. They believe the shootings are more haphazard - all the more worrying for those who believe that the gun culture is out of control. Since the operation began there have been 150 arrests and 15 firearms recovered. Assistant chief constable Sean Price, who chairs meetings of the strategic command team which reviews the operation weekly, said: \"This is the largest and most sustained police operation we have ever carried out. The shootings are not acceptable and we will not allow a gun culture to develop in Nottingham.\" The Nottinghamshire force was yesterday swift to point out that the patrols have been set up as part of a \"specific operation\", but accepts that it is not wrong to call them routine. Until now on mainland Britain, armed officers have been deployed only for diplomatic duties, to tackle specific incidents such as sieges and armed robberies, or in the light of a particular terrorist threat. Armed officers are routinely to be seen at airports. It is up to chief constables to decide if, and how, they wish to deploy armed officers. They do not have to seek clearance from the government. Indeed, the home officer minister, Charles Clarke, was only told of the move in Nottingham last week, but has now asked for a full briefing. The former deputy constable of Greater Manchester, John Stalker, said that thousands of police officers would be aghast at what was happening in Nottingham. He said: \"I see this as another step along the road to routinely arming police. We are moving towards what is happening in places like America and South Africa and away from our concept of an unarmed police force. For a new breed of senior officer, it's no big deal for police to be armed. It is very worrying indeed.\" Ann Widdecombe, the shadow home secretary, said: \"We have now reached a situation where police officers need to carry guns just to do their job. The decision to issue guns is, of course, a matter for the chief constable, but I am confident the decision was only taken in the face of extreme circumstances.\" Crime rise Other forces are watching developments in Nottingham with great interest. Some have dabbled with the idea of routine patrols in the past. After a spate of shootings in north-west London three years ago, the Metropolitan police launched 24-hour armed vehicle patrols. There is no doubt that gun-related crime is on the increase. Last December it emerged that armed crime was up by 10%, with 13,671 armed offences in the year. Government research has found that one in three criminals under 25 has access to a firearm, and there are thought to be more than 3m firearms illegally in circulation, double the number 10 years ago. Manchester has long had a notorious reputation for gun-related crime. There have been 40 shootings this year alone in the south of the city. Inter-gang violence is one of the main causes. Last month seven people were shot in a three-week period, among them a 16-year-old who was killed when he was gunned down at close range as he rode his mountain bike through a park. Police suspect his murder was in retaliation for the death of a 21-year-old, believed to be a member of a rival gang, who was shot as he rode his bicycle through an alley 10 days before. The gangs allegedly involved, the Pit Bulls and the Longsight Crew, are involved in a turf war. Detective superintendent Tony Porter, head of CID for south Manchester, said: \"They are rivals who are young men who wear their firearms as fashion accessories. Some of them seem to think they are achieving kudos and credibility.\" Drugs underpin all the gangland activity, but Mr Porter said that drugs were not the prime motive for the shootings. Police and community leaders agree that guns are becoming all too common on the streets of Manchester. One youth worker, who asked not be named, said: \"People are not shocked by the shootings any more. They just shrug their shoulders as if they are not bothered by it.\" For now the sight of armed police on the beat in Nottingham is an exciting novelty for the estate's children. Soon, however, it too might be mundane.",

      "bodyText": "John Prescott lifted the lid on his stormy relationship with Tony Blair yesterday when he confirmed that he would have resigned from the cabinet if the prime minister had formed a coalition with the Liberal Democrats. Speaking on the eve of the publication of Sir Paddy Ashdown's diaries, Mr Prescott demonstrated his contempt for the prime minister's \"big tent\" politics when he dismissed the idea of a coalition as \"Paddy's dreams\". The diaries of the former Lib Dem leader are expected to confirm that Sir Paddy was involved in lengthy negotiations with Mr Blair in the run-up to the general election over the possibility of forming a coalition government. It is understood that two cabinet posts were to have been offered to the veteran Lib Dem MPs Menzies Campbell and Alan Beith, even if Labour won a majority. A coalition was temporarily ruled out in the immediate aftermath of Labour's landslide. Mr Blair still harboured thoughts of a coalition until Mr Prescott threatened to resign from the cabinet in 1998, a point he confirmed publicly yesterday for the first time. Asked on BBC1's Breakfast with Frost whether he would have served in a Lab-Lib coalition cabinet, Mr Prescott said: \"No. Paddy's dreams.\" Mr Prescott said the prime minister had been right to set up a joint cabinet committee with the Liberal Democrats to discuss constitutional issues. \"Of course we agreed to have meetings,\" he said. \"Tony Blair made it absolutely clear we would discuss issues of constitutional matters, and we continued to do that, and we thought that was profitable and right, on major constitutional issues.\" However, Mr Prescott made clear his disdain for Sir Paddy when he said that the former Lib Dem leader was not happy with sitting on a mere cabinet committee. \"Paddy wanted to go further, he wants to sit in this little chair in the cabinet and become part of the government,\" Mr Prescott said. \"I wouldn't have sat with him, no.\" Asked whether he would sit in cabinet with the current Lib-Dem leader, Charles Kennedy, Mr Prescott said: \"Liberals want to do what is in their interests, but it is not in ours.

Mr Blair was terrified that a Labour government with a small majority would suffer the same fate as John Major, whose premiership was destroyed - after he had secured a small majority in 1992 - by a combination of disloyal Tories and the combined forces of Labour and the Lib Dems.

Mr Barak's survival can be guaranteed for just 10 more days. If he does not woo the hawkish Likud party leader, Ariel Sharon, into a national emergency government, he faces dismissal when Israel's parliament returns at the end of the month.</p> <p>Mr Sharon has made his price for joining the government abundantly clear: dump the peace process. Yesterday, Mr Barak acquiesced.</p> <p>But Mr Barak and his aides tried to obscure such harsh realities, choosing to portray his decision as a suspension, and not the definitive end to negotiation efforts. They also refused to say how long the \"time-out\" would last, leaving the door slightly ajar for yet another diplomatic foray by the US, perhaps after the American elections.</p> <p>Instead, they placed the blame for the suspension of negotiations squarely on the Palestinians and the Arabs.</p> <p>\"After the Arab summit, and in light of its results, we will have to call a time-out, the goal of which will be to reassess the diplomatic process in light of the events of recent weeks,\" said a statement from Mr Barak's office.</p> <p>On his return to Gaza from the summit, Mr Arafat was predictably defiant. \"I expected this from him. It is not the first time he said something like this,\" he said.</p> <p>\"My response is that our people are continuing the road to Jerusalem, the capital of our independent Palestinian state. To accept or not to accept it, let him go to hell,\" Mr Arafat said.</p> <p>Mr Barak was adamant that his time-out was \"dictated by common sense\". With the violence unabated in the West Bank and Gaza, despite two US-mediated ceasefires, he said there was no point in an immediate resumption of negotiations with the Palestinians. In renewed unrest yesterday, four Palestinians were killed, including a 14-year-old boy in Gaza.</p> <p>But while there is little end to the violence, Mr Barak's declaration is fiercely opposed even by members of his own cabinet. They see the time-out as a prelude to forming an emergency government with Mr Sharon within the next few days, an outcome that would destroy the last shreds of Palestinian trust in the Israeli prime minister.</p> <p>The prime minister's aides yesterday insisted he did not need government's approval for his decision - and he might not have received it. At the weekend, at least four ministers voiced dismay, along with Peace Now, the leading coalition of Israeli doves.</p> <p>\"Calming the region is an immediate aim, but it should at the same time be linked to an immediate diplomatic alternative,\" the foreign minister, Shlomo Ben Ami, said.</p> <p>At their summit, the Arab leaders - reduced from 22 to 21 following a protest walkout by Libya - demanded that those \"who committed the massacres against the Palestinians and Arabs in the occupied territories\" be prosecuted as war criminals.</p> <p>Saudi Arabia, a key American ally in the Arab world, accused the US of shirking its responsibilities as a sponsor of the peace process and failing to chastise Israel for \"its unacceptable conduct\".</p> <p><b>War of words</b></p> <p>'We will have to take a time-out to reassess the peace process in response to events of recent weeks' - Ehud Barak</p> <p>'Let him go to hell' - Yasser Arafat</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.secretary.state.gov/index.html\">Madeleine Albright's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.p-p-o.com\">Yasser Arafat's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.pmo.gov.il/english\">Ehud Barak's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.index.gov.il/eng\">Israeli government</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.pna.org\">Palestinian National Authority</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.presidency.gov.eg\" target=\"_new\">Egyptian presidency</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.palestine-info.net/hamas/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">Hamas</a></p>",

Mr Barak met scorn from Yasser Arafat, who told him to \"go to hell\", setting the stage for further confrontation between the two masters of brinkmanship. The emergency summit in Cairo agreed $1bn (\u00a3690m) backing for the Palestinians and called on all Arabs to donate one day's wages \"as a popular Arab contribution to the intifada and support for the national Palestinian struggle\". With the peace process now clinically dead, Mr Barak is again toying with the idea of \"unilateral separation\", carving out a Palestinian state whose borders with Israel would be sealed by concrete walls and electrified fences. Mr Arafat, in turn, is weighing the possibility of a unilateral declaration of independence, on or after November 15, an act that would be met with harsh Israeli reprisals. Such high-wire machinations are the product of the basest of political instincts. Mr Barak's survival can be guaranteed for just 10 more days. If he does not woo the hawkish Likud party leader, Ariel Sharon, into a national emergency government, he faces dismissal when Israel's parliament returns at the end of the month. Mr Sharon has made his price for joining the government abundantly clear: dump the peace process. Yesterday, Mr Barak acquiesced. But Mr Barak and his aides tried to obscure such harsh realities, choosing to portray his decision as a suspension, and not the definitive end to negotiation efforts. They also refused to say how long the \"time-out\" would last, leaving the door slightly ajar for yet another diplomatic foray by the US, perhaps after the American elections. Instead, they placed the blame for the suspension of negotiations squarely on the Palestinians and the Arabs. \"After the Arab summit, and in light of its results, we will have to call a time-out, the goal of which will be to reassess the diplomatic process in light of the events of recent weeks,\" said a statement from Mr Barak's office. On his return to Gaza from the summit, Mr Arafat was predictably defiant. \"I expected this from him. It is not the first time he said something like this,\" he said. \"My response is that our people are continuing the road to Jerusalem, the capital of our independent Palestinian state. To accept or not to accept it, let him go to hell,\" Mr Arafat said. Mr Barak was adamant that his time-out was \"dictated by common sense\". With the violence unabated in the West Bank and Gaza, despite two US-mediated ceasefires, he said there was no point in an immediate resumption of negotiations with the Palestinians. In renewed unrest yesterday, four Palestinians were killed, including a 14-year-old boy in Gaza. But while there is little end to the violence, Mr Barak's declaration is fiercely opposed even by members of his own cabinet. They see the time-out as a prelude to forming an emergency government with Mr Sharon within the next few days, an outcome that would destroy the last shreds of Palestinian trust in the Israeli prime minister. The prime minister's aides yesterday insisted he did not need government's approval for his decision - and he might not have received it. At the weekend, at least four ministers voiced dismay, along with Peace Now, the leading coalition of Israeli doves. \"Calming the region is an immediate aim, but it should at the same time be linked to an immediate diplomatic alternative,\" the foreign minister, Shlomo Ben Ami, said. At their summit, the Arab leaders - reduced from 22 to 21 following a protest walkout by Libya - demanded that those \"who committed the massacres against the Palestinians and Arabs in the occupied territories\" be prosecuted as war criminals. Saudi Arabia, a key American ally in the Arab world, accused the US of shirking its responsibilities as a sponsor of the peace process and failing to chastise Israel for \"its unacceptable conduct\".

A poster on East Croydon station catches the eye of a Guardian reader. \"Will it happen on the next train?\" say the white letters on a black background. \"Will it happen today?\" </p> <p>Intrigued, he takes a closer look. Perhaps this is the industry trying to reassure passengers after another crash in which lives have been lost. Perhaps an explanation for why speed restrictions are being imposed on 81 stretches of line in a textbook case of stable door bolting. No. The pay-off line from Connex South Central is: \"With more people checking than ever before, fare evaders will be caught.\" </p> <p>Apart from its grotesque insensitivity, this warning tells us much about the modern railway industry.

But the problem was not the structure of the industry but the lack of money. </p> <p>However, there seems a strange reluctance now to state the blindingly obvious. Let us stop messing around and restore Railtrack to public ownership. The idea that Labour should do what it said it would do in opposition does not appear on the agenda. </p> <p>Indeed, it is as though the very mention of the words \"public ownership\" is a faux pas. It would be the simplest thing in the world for Labour to blame privatisation for Southall, Paddington and Hatfield, but it shows not the slightest desire to do so for fear that it might then come under pressure to reassert state control over the railways. </p> <p>There can really only be three explanations for the government's refusal to countenance renationalisation. The first is that it has an ideological objection, sharing the Conservative belief that the private sector is innately superior. The second is that it would like to renationalise the railways but has not got the money. The third is it fears renationalisation would be unpopular with the voters. </p> <p>It only takes a moment to realise that none of these possible explanations holds water. If Labour really has a doctrinal problem with state ownership, then logically this must extend to those parts of the economy which are still in public hands, up to and including the national health service. Yet ministers see it as their duty - their destiny, even - to prevent Nye Bevan's creation falling into the hands of the privatisers.

A poster on East Croydon station catches the eye of a Guardian reader. \"Will it happen on the next train?\" say the white letters on a black background. \"Will it happen today?\" Intrigued, he takes a closer look. Perhaps this is the industry trying to reassure passengers after another crash in which lives have been lost. Perhaps an explanation for why speed restrictions are being imposed on 81 stretches of line in a textbook case of stable door bolting. No. The pay-off line from Connex South Central is: \"With more people checking than ever before, fare evaders will be caught.\" Apart from its grotesque insensitivity, this warning tells us much about the modern railway industry. The name of the game is profit maximisation and for the train operating companies that means cramming more passengers on to the finite number of trains and making sure that fewer of them bilk the system.

      "bodyText": "Research carried out for the government has revealed that its own employees are the most demoralised group of workers in the country. Twenty years of cost-cutting and constant change have left Britain's army of Whitehall civil servants the most demoralised group of workers in the UK, the survey shows. Central government employees are the least likely to look forward to going to work when they wake up in the morning, the least likely to be proud to tell other people who they work for, and have the weakest sense of loyalty towards their employers. Only one in seven say they trust senior management. The embarrassing findings, which the Cabinet Office tried to water down, are revealed in research carried out by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development for the government's in-house civil service training centre. Its findings, to be published on Wednesday, suggest that the prime minister's pledge to modernise British government could be threatened by discontented civil servants. The head of the civil service, Sir Richard Butler, said it provided a welcome insight into what staff in Whitehall think. \"But we accept fully that there is a lot more work to be done.\" Privately however, sources say the Cabinet Office was dismayed by the negative picture of Whitehall workers emerging from the research, for which it provided 15% of the funding. Senior officials at the Cabinet Office asked the institute to play down the morale problem in its presentation of the report, fearing ministers could use it as a stick with which to beat the civil service. Continuous Whitehall restructuring is to blame for the low morale, according to the institute. \"Over the last two decades central government has enjoyed a plethora of initiatives designed to extend the operation of business disciplines and practices within the public sector,\" said Mike Emmott of the CIPD. \"Such change clearly does not come without a cost.\" Low morale comes despite civil servants enjoying more job security than any other group of workers and the most flexible working arrangements.

Ever since July when Miss Boothroyd announced her intention to stand down in October and let parliament make an informed choice on the 152nd holder of her office the prospect of chaos has been compounded by the size of the field and pressure to democratise the process.</p> <p>Sir Edward has not made it easier by his refusal to say if he will adapt the existing procedure for the election to the 12-candidate situation. Alternatively, he could take Tony Benn's advice and use his powers to invent a new tradition - a simple vote between every candidate who is nominated, followed by a run-off between the two with the highest votes.</p> <p>Either way, Michael Martin, Labour MP for Glasgow Springburn, remains the odds-on favourite, though there are enough MPs around who want someone else to win to make it a horse race. Sir George Young, the former Tory cabinet minister and baronet, is the former shop steward's main rival.</p> <p>But the prospect that Mo Mowlam will propose her old friend Gwyneth Dunwoody, if Sir Edward lets her, underlines the fact that anything may happen. Friends of David Clark, dismissed from the cabinet in 1998, say that he is more likely than Mrs Dunwoody to slip through the middle if Mr Martin falters.</p> <p>But how will MPs vote at all? The former prime minister will be acting in his capacity of father of the House. He is the longest serving MP, first elected in the 1950 general election, the man who took Britain into Europe in 1973, still MP for Old Bexley and Sidcup and a regular Commons attender at 84.</p> <p>Friends confirm that he sometimes tires easily and can get grumpy but remains in possession of his powers.</p> <p>In 1992 when Miss Boothroyd beat the Tory former cabinet minister Peter Brooke by 372 to 238 votes, Sir Edward was in the chair. There were five potential candidates, including Labour's Harold Walker, then deputy Speaker to Bernard Weatherill.</p> <p>Sir Harold, as he became, never got near testing his claim. The Speakership - Peter de Montfort was the first in 1268 - has usually been carved up by the party establishments so that an acceptable name emerged.</p> <p>But the times are becoming more democratic. In 1992, Sir Edward followed a limited precedent in accepting a nomination from the Tory side, Mr Brooke.</p> <p>With up to a dozen candidates it is all much harder. Rumour last night was that Sir Edward will decide that a Benn ballot will prove too complex and longwinded. Indeed, some MPs predicted he will tell them they must choose between the two perceived frontrunners, Mr Martin and Sir George.</p> <p>That would cause ructions. Sir Edward is not telling even senior whips what he will do. But if speculation is right he will adapt the 1992 procedure in some way. If he goes by seniority, what form of seniority? Sir George is a cabinet grandee and privy counsellor, elected in 1974.</p> <p>But should nomination go on long service? On government seniority or Commons seniority? As Betty Boothroyd's deputy, Sir Alan Haselhurst has that claim. Yet another school of thought says that the seniority of the MP nominating a candidate should influence Sir Edward.</p> <p>If Sir Edward follows his own precedence he will simply go for alphabetical seniority. But even that presents problems. As such David Clark comes first on the Labour side while Mick Martin comes in the middle and Sir George right at the end. Even with proposers and seconders making very short speeches it might take hours longer than 84-year-old Sir Edward's bones could stand. It could be a long day.</p> <p><b>The runners</b></p> <p>\u0095 Alan Beith, 57, Liberal Democrat MP for Berwick-upon-Tweed since 1973.

Either way, Michael Martin, Labour MP for Glasgow Springburn, remains the odds-on favourite, though there are enough MPs around who want someone else to win to make it a horse race. Sir George Young, the former Tory cabinet minister and baronet, is the former shop steward's main rival. But the prospect that Mo Mowlam will propose her old friend Gwyneth Dunwoody, if Sir Edward lets her, underlines the fact that anything may happen. Friends of David Clark, dismissed from the cabinet in 1998, say that he is more likely than Mrs Dunwoody to slip through the middle if Mr Martin falters. But how will MPs vote at all? The former prime minister will be acting in his capacity of father of the House. He is the longest serving MP, first elected in the 1950 general election, the man who took Britain into Europe in 1973, still MP for Old Bexley and Sidcup and a regular Commons attender at 84. Friends confirm that he sometimes tires easily and can get grumpy but remains in possession of his powers. In 1992 when Miss Boothroyd beat the Tory former cabinet minister Peter Brooke by 372 to 238 votes, Sir Edward was in the chair. There were five potential candidates, including Labour's Harold Walker, then deputy Speaker to Bernard Weatherill. Sir Harold, as he became, never got near testing his claim. The Speakership - Peter de Montfort was the first in 1268 - has usually been carved up by the party establishments so that an acceptable name emerged. But the times are becoming more democratic. In 1992, Sir Edward followed a limited precedent in accepting a nomination from the Tory side, Mr Brooke. With up to a dozen candidates it is all much harder. Rumour last night was that Sir Edward will decide that a Benn ballot will prove too complex and longwinded. Indeed, some MPs predicted he will tell them they must choose between the two perceived frontrunners, Mr Martin and Sir George. That would cause ructions. Sir Edward is not telling even senior whips what he will do. But if speculation is right he will adapt the 1992 procedure in some way. If he goes by seniority, what form of seniority? Sir George is a cabinet grandee and privy counsellor, elected in 1974. But should nomination go on long service? On government seniority or Commons seniority? As Betty Boothroyd's deputy, Sir Alan Haselhurst has that claim. Yet another school of thought says that the seniority of the MP nominating a candidate should influence Sir Edward. If Sir Edward follows his own precedence he will simply go for alphabetical seniority. But even that presents problems. As such David Clark comes first on the Labour side while Mick Martin comes in the middle and Sir George right at the end. Even with proposers and seconders making very short speeches it might take hours longer than 84-year-old Sir Edward's bones could stand. It could be a long day.

      "body": "<p>The contempt in which I hold the greedy and incompetent men who run benighted Railtrack was not reduced by Gerald Corbett's offer to resign. No doubt it was meant sincerely. But who can doubt that it will be cynically exploited in the hope of improving the putrefying image of a company which ought not to exist. It is easy enough to predict what the apologists for the next disaster will say. Not concerned with safety? Was not the anguished chief executive prepared to sacrifice his astronomical salary as an act of contrition and proof of repentance for the Hatfield tragedy? And did he then not agree, despite his vicarious trauma, to accept the judgment of colleagues that only he could create a rail network which was fit for heroes to travel on? Railtrack, run by a saint and martyr, will become beyond reproach.</p> <p>The piety will, however, be Augustinian. Oh Lord, make the railways safe - but not yet. Weaknesses on the section of the line on which the Hatfield crash happened were identified at the turn of the year. Work of a sort began eight months later. The track, inspected on October 10 and found \"safe\" was, according to Railtrack's immediate admission, \"one of the factors\" which led to another four railway deaths. Then the notion of admitting culpability was hit upon as the best way to ingratiate Railtrack with the public. If the top man had taken responsibility for that deplorable sequence of events, the notion that safety was the operator's first priority might have sounded almost plausible. But it would not have been true. Railtrack's first priority is profit.</p> <p>I am reminded of Railtrack's reason for existence every Monday morning as I stand amongst the bricks and rubble waiting for the nine forty from Chesterfield to London. A year ago Chesterfield was a slightly dilapidated but entirely adequate station. It is now being transformed into what will look like a cross between a giant filling station and a television evangelist's chapel in one of the more vulgar suburbs of Dallas or Houston. The notices, which apologise for any inconvenience caused, ends with the announcement that the new development will include numerous \"retail opportunities\". Railtrack can, it seems, raise capital to invest in commercial property. What a pity that they cannot, or do not, raise it to accelerate the (admittedly less remunerative) safety programme.</p> <p>It would be easy to suggest that there is an innate, but obvious, immorality in Railtrack's choice of priorities - easy but wrong. As Frederick Von Hayek - the real patron saint of rail privatisation - is the first to insist, private enterprise is amoral. It operates according to rules which have nothing to do with ethics or social justice. It is there to make a profit and, as a by-product of that process, guarantee the efficiency that competition and the free market bring to the economy. That was the theory on which the privatisation of British Rail was based.</p> <p>There was a flaw in the Tory government's logic. The benefits of competition have not come to the railways because privatisation created a series of private monopolies. Competition requires consumers to be offered a choice. If I want to travel by rail to Chesterfield, my choice is limited to going by Midland main line or going somewhere else. I cannot believe that many customers (as passengers are now called) say to themselves, \"I was going to York by Great North Eastern but Virgin give free drinks to first class ticket holders so I shall go to Manchester instead\". Competition was only possible on the railways when rival companies offered alternative services to the same destination. Now all we have is a bonanza - profit without the pressure to improve what the market provides.</p> <p>In the days of real rail competition my parents could travel to London from either Sheffield Victoria or Sheffield Midland station and the rails over which they were carried would have been particular to the railway company of their choice. Not even John Redwood - who wanted competition in water supply and in consequence a double or treble set of taps in every bathroom - suggests we duplicate track. So Railtrack remains a monopoly. There was no more justification for privatising BR than there would be for selling off the motorways.</p> <p>The argument against correcting the crass economic mistake is the cost of renationalisation. So the government will have no choice but to increase Railtrack's value by providing extra funds to meet improved safety's bills. Either that or more customers will die. The moral blackmail is irresistible. But the absurdity of using public money to subsidise the private railway's profits was one of the reasons why the companies were nationalised in 1948. The government could impose such stringent safety regulations on the industry that the profits would fall, the value be reduced and the possibility of a cheap buy back increase. That would be a highly disreputable way to behave. But the directors of Railtrack would understand.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",

It is easy enough to predict what the apologists for the next disaster will say. Not concerned with safety? Was not the anguished chief executive prepared to sacrifice his astronomical salary as an act of contrition and proof of repentance for the Hatfield tragedy? And did he then not agree, despite his vicarious trauma, to accept the judgment of colleagues that only he could create a rail network which was fit for heroes to travel on? Railtrack, run by a saint and martyr, will become beyond reproach. The piety will, however, be Augustinian. Oh Lord, make the railways safe - but not yet. Weaknesses on the section of the line on which the Hatfield crash happened were identified at the turn of the year. Work of a sort began eight months later. The track, inspected on October 10 and found \"safe\" was, according to Railtrack's immediate admission, \"one of the factors\" which led to another four railway deaths. Then the notion of admitting culpability was hit upon as the best way to ingratiate Railtrack with the public. If the top man had taken responsibility for that deplorable sequence of events, the notion that safety was the operator's first priority might have sounded almost plausible. But it would not have been true. Railtrack's first priority is profit. I am reminded of Railtrack's reason for existence every Monday morning as I stand amongst the bricks and rubble waiting for the nine forty from Chesterfield to London. A year ago Chesterfield was a slightly dilapidated but entirely adequate station. It is now being transformed into what will look like a cross between a giant filling station and a television evangelist's chapel in one of the more vulgar suburbs of Dallas or Houston. The notices, which apologise for any inconvenience caused, ends with the announcement that the new development will include numerous \"retail opportunities\". Railtrack can, it seems, raise capital to invest in commercial property. What a pity that they cannot, or do not, raise it to accelerate the (admittedly less remunerative) safety programme. It would be easy to suggest that there is an innate, but obvious, immorality in Railtrack's choice of priorities - easy but wrong. As Frederick Von Hayek - the real patron saint of rail privatisation - is the first to insist, private enterprise is amoral. It operates according to rules which have nothing to do with ethics or social justice. It is there to make a profit and, as a by-product of that process, guarantee the efficiency that competition and the free market bring to the economy. That was the theory on which the privatisation of British Rail was based. There was a flaw in the Tory government's logic. The benefits of competition have not come to the railways because privatisation created a series of private monopolies. Competition requires consumers to be offered a choice. If I want to travel by rail to Chesterfield, my choice is limited to going by Midland main line or going somewhere else. I cannot believe that many customers (as passengers are now called) say to themselves, \"I was going to York by Great North Eastern but Virgin give free drinks to first class ticket holders so I shall go to Manchester instead\". Competition was only possible on the railways when rival companies offered alternative services to the same destination. Now all we have is a bonanza - profit without the pressure to improve what the market provides. In the days of real rail competition my parents could travel to London from either Sheffield Victoria or Sheffield Midland station and the rails over which they were carried would have been particular to the railway company of their choice. Not even John Redwood - who wanted competition in water supply and in consequence a double or treble set of taps in every bathroom - suggests we duplicate track. So Railtrack remains a monopoly. There was no more justification for privatising BR than there would be for selling off the motorways. The argument against correcting the crass economic mistake is the cost of renationalisation. So the government will have no choice but to increase Railtrack's value by providing extra funds to meet improved safety's bills. Either that or more customers will die. The moral blackmail is irresistible. But the absurdity of using public money to subsidise the private railway's profits was one of the reasons why the companies were nationalised in 1948. The government could impose such stringent safety regulations on the industry that the profits would fall, the value be reduced and the possibility of a cheap buy back increase. That would be a highly disreputable way to behave. But the directors of Railtrack would understand. comment@theguardian.com",

American voters may not be the most attentive in the world, but they also kick the tyres when offered a \"great deal\" at the used car lot.</p> <p>So why did Gallup/CNN/USA Today, for instance, give Bush a 10-point lead in voting intention, but report that most of these same people scored Gore 6% ahead of Bush on policies and nine points ahead on clarity of expression? The clue to the mystery, as in the Hound of the Baskervilles, is the dog we don't hear barking. Nobody at the national level has an ear to something that is happening in millions of homes across this vast country. It's this: when families sit down in front of the television, they are assailed and wooed night after night, hour after hour, by the most momentous political advertising campaign in history. So far Bush has spent $120m and Gore only $60m. \"Only!\"</p> <p>This advertising blitz, from the richer party, with more support from business, makes a farce of elective democracy, but it is only a Republican revenge for what the Democrats did to them in 1996 when Bill Clinton routed Bob Dole to win a second term. Nobody noticed in the early summer of 1996 that the Democrats were spending advertising millions unconventionally early. The Clinton campaign kept the scale of their spending secret. They concentrated the investment outside the media capitals of New York and Los Angeles. Neither the press or the Republican party caught on until it was too late.</p> <p>The scale of the Bush advertising campaign is one thing. The other is the cleverness of its disinformation. Ordinary people watching may well believe that the Gore they saw is really \"Gore-gantuan\" who secretly has plans to raise federal spending more than any president since Johnson's Great Society. They are being misled. As a percentage of national income, the only meaningful standard, Gore promises to reduce federal spending. Another scare ad says he will spend three times as much as Clinton envisaged in 1992. Again, it is not true.</p> <p>The most outrageous telly-con of all is the one that states Gore's prescription drug plan will subjugate senior citizens to the dreaded health management organisations which may overrule doctors. In fact, Gore relies on the government's respected fee-for-service Medicare programme. It is Bush who intends to create pressure on older folk to join managed care plans. But who will brief the couch potatoes?</p> <p>What is really at stake in this election is not so much this or that social security plan. It is the future of American democracy. All the barriers to control the insidious influence of money are down. If Gore wins, there will be reform. He has said he will make the McCain-Feingold campaign finance bill his first priority. Bush refuses to commit. Why should he? Money is working for him. He has made his position perfectly clear - in Bush-speak: \"I do not agree with this notion that somehow if I go to try to attract votes and to lead people toward a better tomorrow somehow I get subscribed to some - some doctrine gets subscribed to me.\" Work that one out, my dear Watson.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",

The clue to the mystery, as in the Hound of the Baskervilles, is the dog we don't hear barking. Nobody at the national level has an ear to something that is happening in millions of homes across this vast country. It's this: when families sit down in front of the television, they are assailed and wooed night after night, hour after hour, by the most momentous political advertising campaign in history. So far Bush has spent $120m and Gore only $60m. \"Only!\" This advertising blitz, from the richer party, with more support from business, makes a farce of elective democracy, but it is only a Republican revenge for what the Democrats did to them in 1996 when Bill Clinton routed Bob Dole to win a second term. Nobody noticed in the early summer of 1996 that the Democrats were spending advertising millions unconventionally early. The Clinton campaign kept the scale of their spending secret. They concentrated the investment outside the media capitals of New York and Los Angeles. Neither the press or the Republican party caught on until it was too late. The scale of the Bush advertising campaign is one thing. The other is the cleverness of its disinformation. Ordinary people watching may well believe that the Gore they saw is really \"Gore-gantuan\" who secretly has plans to raise federal spending more than any president since Johnson's Great Society. They are being misled. As a percentage of national income, the only meaningful standard, Gore promises to reduce federal spending. Another scare ad says he will spend three times as much as Clinton envisaged in 1992. Again, it is not true. The most outrageous telly-con of all is the one that states Gore's prescription drug plan will subjugate senior citizens to the dreaded health management organisations which may overrule doctors. In fact, Gore relies on the government's respected fee-for-service Medicare programme. It is Bush who intends to create pressure on older folk to join managed care plans. But who will brief the couch potatoes? What is really at stake in this election is not so much this or that social security plan. It is the future of American democracy. All the barriers to control the insidious influence of money are down. If Gore wins, there will be reform. He has said he will make the McCain-Feingold campaign finance bill his first priority. Bush refuses to commit. Why should he? Money is working for him. He has made his position perfectly clear - in Bush-speak: \"I do not agree with this notion that somehow if I go to try to attract votes and to lead people toward a better tomorrow somehow I get subscribed to some - some doctrine gets subscribed to me.\" Work that one out, my dear Watson. comment@theguardian.com",

Jeremy Howarth, former deputy chairman of European Leisure, was fined \u00a3151,000 and given a 220-hour community service order after being found guilty of ramping the firm's shares to help its takeover of Midsummer Leisure. His sentence was subsequently upgraded to a 20-month jail term, but the two years it took for this appeal to be heard was deemed unjust by the European Court which last month ruled he should be paid a token \u00a3750 compensation and \u00a38,000 costs. Mr Howarth is now taking his case to the Criminal Cases Review Commission, an independent body set up in 1997 to investigate suspected miscarriages of justice. The aim, he told the Guardian last night, was to have the original conviction thrown out and gain reversal of his five-year ban from being a director.

A third defendant, George Hendry, was originally given a conditional discharge but this was increased to a 12-month sentence, suspended for two years on health grounds. The origins of the case against Mr Howarth date back to March 1993 when he was interviewed by officers from the serious fraud office in con nection with allegations of market rigging, theft and false accounting. He was charged four months later and stood trial between October 1994 and February 1995 when he was found guilty, along with two fellow directors, and sentenced the following month. A spokesman for the Criminal Cases Review Commission said: \"We can confirm we have received the application from Mr Howarth and it will be allocated a case review manager.\" A decision on whether or not Mr Howarth's case is referred to the court of appeal might not be made for up to 12 months.",

      "body": "<p>Last year Ted Owen put out a call through Stoke-on-Trent's local paper, the Sentinel, for people to come forward and stand for the council. At a social event attended by Martin Bell, the independent MP for Tatton, several interested hopefuls gathered from which nine candidates emerged. In May, when 20 of the council's 60 seats were up for grabs, they all stood and all won, taking eight seats from Labour and one from the Conservatives. The independents number 15, the second largest group in the council, with as many seats as the Tories and Liberal Democrats put together.</p> <p>\"It was a kick against the system,\" says Owen, the leader of the independent group. Owen is a former Labour councillor who was deselected because \"he wouldn't toe the line\" and has stood and won as an independent ever since. He puts the victories down partly to a local revolt against the history of one-party rule in a city where Labour once held all the seats. \"It was a reaction against the old-boy network and everything that was going on behind closed doors. Not enough people knew what was going on. They wanted things opened up,\" he says. And he puts the victories down partly to a general disaffection with Labour. \"They were angry about the pensions in particular but also the general arrogance of them in parliament. Most, but by no means all, of our support comes from former Labour voters.\"</p> <p>But if the people of Stoke were kicking against the system, they were swimming with the tide. Their decision to turn their backs on the established parties en masse illustrates a growing divergence between the political class and the prevailing political culture which it is supposed to reflect. It is a dissonance characterised not so much by a clash between left and right - although it is informed by it - but between the margins and the mainstream, which finds its expression in various forms. In Birmingham, where the Justice For Kashmir party has five council seats, it is essentially ethnic. In Preston, where three independent councillors have joined the hard-left Socialist Alliance, it is ideological. If the rural areas continue to bust while the rest of the country booms, it could soon be geographic - a rural party standing against the perception of metropolitan domination of politics.</p> <p>It is not a trend confined to Britain. In Denmark, all the mainstream parties, unions and business representatives pushed for a Yes vote in the euro referendum. The people voted No. Nor is its progress uniform. In Switzerland, a recent referendum over whether to limit immigration united the political and economic establishment against the proposal. The people backed them.</p> <p>But it is gathering pace. In America more than a third of the electorate was too busy or uninterested to vote in 1996 - more than double the figure in 1980. It is little wonder when membership of the political class there is beginning to look hereditary. The Republican presidential candidate, George Bush, is running for the job his dad used to have while his Democrat counterpart, Al Gore, has already filled his father's shoes as a Tennessee senator. They are drawing from a gene puddle of leadership talent confined not to national politics but extending to civil rights, trade unions and municipal government.

      "bodyText": "Last year Ted Owen put out a call through Stoke-on-Trent's local paper, the Sentinel, for people to come forward and stand for the council. At a social event attended by Martin Bell, the independent MP for Tatton, several interested hopefuls gathered from which nine candidates emerged. In May, when 20 of the council's 60 seats were up for grabs, they all stood and all won, taking eight seats from Labour and one from the Conservatives. The independents number 15, the second largest group in the council, with as many seats as the Tories and Liberal Democrats put together. \"It was a kick against the system,\" says Owen, the leader of the independent group. Owen is a former Labour councillor who was deselected because \"he wouldn't toe the line\" and has stood and won as an independent ever since. He puts the victories down partly to a local revolt against the history of one-party rule in a city where Labour once held all the seats. \"It was a reaction against the old-boy network and everything that was going on behind closed doors. Not enough people knew what was going on. They wanted things opened up,\" he says. And he puts the victories down partly to a general disaffection with Labour. \"They were angry about the pensions in particular but also the general arrogance of them in parliament. Most, but by no means all, of our support comes from former Labour voters.\" But if the people of Stoke were kicking against the system, they were swimming with the tide. Their decision to turn their backs on the established parties en masse illustrates a growing divergence between the political class and the prevailing political culture which it is supposed to reflect. It is a dissonance characterised not so much by a clash between left and right - although it is informed by it - but between the margins and the mainstream, which finds its expression in various forms. In Birmingham, where the Justice For Kashmir party has five council seats, it is essentially ethnic. In Preston, where three independent councillors have joined the hard-left Socialist Alliance, it is ideological. If the rural areas continue to bust while the rest of the country booms, it could soon be geographic - a rural party standing against the perception of metropolitan domination of politics. It is not a trend confined to Britain. In Denmark, all the mainstream parties, unions and business representatives pushed for a Yes vote in the euro referendum. The people voted No. Nor is its progress uniform. In Switzerland, a recent referendum over whether to limit immigration united the political and economic establishment against the proposal. The people backed them. But it is gathering pace. In America more than a third of the electorate was too busy or uninterested to vote in 1996 - more than double the figure in 1980. It is little wonder when membership of the political class there is beginning to look hereditary. The Republican presidential candidate, George Bush, is running for the job his dad used to have while his Democrat counterpart, Al Gore, has already filled his father's shoes as a Tennessee senator. They are drawing from a gene puddle of leadership talent confined not to national politics but extending to civil rights, trade unions and municipal government. Martin Luther King III (the head of the Southern Christian leadership conference), James Hoffa (the head of the Teamster union), and Richard Daley (the mayor of Chicago) occupy the same positions as their fathers a generation ago. If the low viewing figures for the presidential debates are anything to go by, the turnout for this year's election could be even lower. But this marginalisation does not stop at electoral politics. The uprisings in Seattle, Prague and Washington, the fuel protests and attacks on \"paedophiles\" in Portsmouth are all, in their own very different ways, examples of what happens when people are either unwilling or unable to access the levers of power to effect change that is both democratic and meaningful. This is not the product of some vast conspiracy but a confluence of factors which have over the past few decades gradually rendered mainstream politics irrelevant to many and remote to most. As larger parties have dumped their ideological baggage and started travelling light, there is often little apart from their rhetoric to distinguish them.

Davina, for example, loves them for their snuggliness and sexual qualities. Holby City's Angela Griffin thinks hers are too small and wouldn't rule out a boob job. And according to Tara Newley, her mother Joan Collins thought she had done enough by passing on her big-breastedness to her daughter without taking her to buy a bra. </p> <p>Talking openly of their first bras and the trials of breastfeeding, these women revealed much more of their true selves than they might have in a hundred conventional celebrity interviews, their contributions demonstrating their eloquence, humour and ordinariness. Handling its subject matter with dignity and wit, Breasts Uncupped deserves plaudits for proving that worthy need not mean dull and accessible need not mean dumb. A follow-up focusing on testicular cancer and men's relationships with their bits is apparently in the making. If it's half as informative and slick as Breasts Uncupped, it will be quite a class act. This is the kind of health education programming that should be shown in schools, as well as primetime BBC1. </p> <p>From knockers to <strong> The Knock</strong> (ITV, Saturday), which isn't half as much fun as anything breast-related. After another makeover - which makes one more than Madonna's had in her entire life - the returning series (which isn't) began with some men standing outside a container by the docks. What could be inside, they wondered. Drugs? Guns? A Finnegan brother from Brookside? All wrong, actually, as it turned out to be a bomb. Thus began a wannabe epic with the action flitting from Docklands to Liberia, Kosovo and Bristol before a dramatic climax in a field outside London. Yes, it kind of lost it (it being coherent plot, pleasing acting and credibility) towards the end. But more ridiculous than any of the plot points were the characters. Supposedly top potatoes in Customs and Excise, the Indigo team were, in fact, as thick as mince. </p> <p>Take Jess, the glamorous surveillance expert. When a dodgy geezer put a bag in his car, got into the car and drove off, she mused \"It looks like he's going somewhere.\" Gee, you think? Later, when she hears a mysterious answering machine message - \"There's smoke on the water\" - she said \"Must be some kind of code.\" Either that or a Deep Purple fan is making crank calls. When she found a couple of minor characters who'd been shot in the head, it wouldn't have been wildly out of character for her to have said \"I think they're dead.\" According to her colleagues, Jess is a real smart cookie. Shows how stupid they are. </p> <p>Stupid like Glenn, their boss with the Birmingham-Brisbane accent. Barking orders and trying to look masterful, he's spent far too much time watching the Captain Jean-Luc Picard Guide To Good Leadership video and not nearly enough learning how not to sound like a bad Meryl Streep impersonator. No wonder Rik Mayall almost got away with smuggling guns to Liberia and drugs into Britain with all the inconspicuous mannerisms of a panto villain. It's a marvel the Indigo team manage to get dressed by themselves, never mind bring gun-runners and drug-smugglers to justice. And they don't have any guns. </p> <p>All of which leads us to a crisis in masculinity, as most things do these days. <strong> Icons of the 20th Century</strong> (Channel 5, Sunday) looked at masculinity through some photographs from the National Portrait Gallery's collection, put together to encapsulate the last century. From discussions of pictures of John Wayne to David Beckham, it was enjoyable and thought-provoking. If you can't get to the gallery, that is.</p>",

From knockers to The Knock (ITV, Saturday), which isn't half as much fun as anything breast-related. After another makeover - which makes one more than Madonna's had in her entire life - the returning series (which isn't) began with some men standing outside a container by the docks. What could be inside, they wondered. Drugs? Guns? A Finnegan brother from Brookside? All wrong, actually, as it turned out to be a bomb. Thus began a wannabe epic with the action flitting from Docklands to Liberia, Kosovo and Bristol before a dramatic climax in a field outside London. Yes, it kind of lost it (it being coherent plot, pleasing acting and credibility) towards the end. But more ridiculous than any of the plot points were the characters. Supposedly top potatoes in Customs and Excise, the Indigo team were, in fact, as thick as mince. Take Jess, the glamorous surveillance expert. When a dodgy geezer put a bag in his car, got into the car and drove off, she mused \"It looks like he's going somewhere.\" Gee, you think? Later, when she hears a mysterious answering machine message - \"There's smoke on the water\" - she said \"Must be some kind of code.\" Either that or a Deep Purple fan is making crank calls. When she found a couple of minor characters who'd been shot in the head, it wouldn't have been wildly out of character for her to have said \"I think they're dead.\" According to her colleagues, Jess is a real smart cookie. Shows how stupid they are. Stupid like Glenn, their boss with the Birmingham-Brisbane accent. Barking orders and trying to look masterful, he's spent far too much time watching the Captain Jean-Luc Picard Guide To Good Leadership video and not nearly enough learning how not to sound like a bad Meryl Streep impersonator. No wonder Rik Mayall almost got away with smuggling guns to Liberia and drugs into Britain with all the inconspicuous mannerisms of a panto villain. It's a marvel the Indigo team manage to get dressed by themselves, never mind bring gun-runners and drug-smugglers to justice. And they don't have any guns. All of which leads us to a crisis in masculinity, as most things do these days. Icons of the 20th Century (Channel 5, Sunday) looked at masculinity through some photographs from the National Portrait Gallery's collection, put together to encapsulate the last century. From discussions of pictures of John Wayne to David Beckham, it was enjoyable and thought-provoking. If you can't get to the gallery, that is.",

The long-awaited report, which has been incubating for six years, could pave the way for the government to boost rights for unmarried couples in England without seeming at the same time to undermine the institution of marriage.</p> <p>Under the present law, wives and husbands are entitled to a share in the value of their home if they split up. It makes no difference whose name is on the deeds. A spouse who needs support can also claim regular maintenance payments from the other. But skip the ceremony and there is no right to claim maintenance, no matter how long the relationship lasts. And if the home is bought in only one partner's name, the other has no automatic entitlement to a share. Some ex-cohabitees have won a share by proving they made a contribution and by taking expensive legal proceedings. Others have tried that route and been left with nothing.</p> <p>Valerie Burns lived with Patrick Burns for 19 years. She changed her name to his and looked after the home - bought in his name - and the couple's two children, who were 17 and 18 when their parents split up. For five years before she left him in 1980 she worked and bought household equipment and furniture, though she did not contribute to the mortgage. She took her case to court but got nothing. \"Is that fair?\" asks Mark Harper, a family law partner in the London law firm Withers.</p> <p>The number of cohabiting couples has soared in the last 20 years. Social Trends for 1999 noted that one in four men and women between 16 and 49 were living together unmarried. Yet studies show that few are aware how limited their rights are. The widespread - but wrong - use of the term \"common law wife\" leads many to believe they have the same protection as husbands and wives. There is a pervasive myth that there is a fixed period of years - some guess three years, others seven or 10 - after which the law treats living together as equivalent to marriage. That means many people are in for a rude shock when their relationship ends.</p> <p>The 1989 Children Act gave a limited right where there are children for the mother to have a share of the house for the benefit of the children.But the courts have interpreted this restrictively. Harper cites a case in which a mother of five children who had lived with her partner for 15 years won the right to the sale proceeds of their home to buy a house for herself and the children. But when the youngest child is 21 the house will have to be sold and the money given back to the children's father, leaving her homeless in her mid-50s.</p> <p>Research carried out for the law commission in 1995, but still unpublished, shows that the public believes couples - at least heterosexual ones - should be treated much the same by the law, regardless of whether or not their union is sanctioned by a marriage ceremony. A sample of 2,000 people aged 16 and over were asked whether they thought, when a married couple with young children separated, that the woman should get a share of the value of the house, even though she had made no financial contribution to buying it. Some 77% thought she should be entitled to half the value, and 15% the whole value. Where the couple was unmarried, 73% thought she should have half the value of the house, and 12% the whole house.</p> <p>Where the couple's children had left home, 80% felt the woman should have half the value of the house if the couple were married, and 73% if they were unmarried. But where a cohabiting couple had no children, only 31% thought the woman should get as much as half the home's value. Respondents were less sympathetic to claims by those in same-sex relationships. Where two men separated, only 24% felt that the man who had made no financial contribution should get half the house, and 44% thought he should get nothing - much higher than the 29% who felt that a woman in a childless heterosexual relationship should be left with nothing.</p> <p>Though the public, it seems, makes little distinction between married and unmarried couples, the government is anxious to be seen to be according marriage a special status. Bruising encounters with Tory family fundamentalists, whipped up by right-wing newspapers, during the passage of what became the Family Law Act 1996, have left ministers feeling nervous about reforms in this field. Labour also wants to avoid accusations of creating a nanny state, and wants to leave people free to opt out of any new system of rights for unmarried couples if they wish.</p> <p>So the new law proposed for Scotland would not give unmarried couples the same rights as married ones, but they would have greater rights than they have now. A partner who suffered economic disadvantage - from giving up work, say, to look after children - would be able to apply to the court for a lump sum from the other after separation, although there would be no right to claim maintenance. Any legal doubts about the enforceability of cohabitation contracts would be removed, and couples would be able to use these to opt out of the rights regime if they wished. The Law Society and the Solicitors Family Law Association have recommend similar reforms for England and Wales, including a right to apply for a lump sum after a split and a right to opt out by contract. In addition, both bodies want a right to apply for short-term maintenance, for up to three or four years at most.</p> <p>What seems curious is the assumption that marriage can be either buttressed or undermined by the rights accorded to unmarried couples, given that research shows that couples tend to choose marriage or cohabitation for reasons which have nothing to do with legal rights, and indeed are largely unaware of what those rights are. If couples - or at least the richer partners - choose cohabitation to avoid the financial consequences of a possible divorce, it's at least arguable that giving married and unmarried couples the same rights would encourage more to marry, since the financial risk would be the same.</p> <p>But, as governments should know by now, changes in family law don't translate into changes in people's behaviour. (If any area of law influenced the boom in cohabitation in the 1980s, it was probably tax law. Until the loophole was closed, unmarried couples could claim twice as much tax relief on their mortgage interest as husbands and wives, who were treated as one person.)</p> <p>As Stephen Cretney of All Souls College, Oxford, one of the country's leading family law academics, told an Oxford seminar on marriage and cohabitation last April: \"Almost every piece of family legislation enacted in England and Wales in the past century has actually worked out in a way radically different from the policy presented to the legislature as justifying the legislation in question, and has often had results quite different from those which the initiators really intended.\"</p>",

If couples - or at least the richer partners - choose cohabitation to avoid the financial consequences of a possible divorce, it's at least arguable that giving married and unmarried couples the same rights would encourage more to marry, since the financial risk would be the same. But, as governments should know by now, changes in family law don't translate into changes in people's behaviour. (If any area of law influenced the boom in cohabitation in the 1980s, it was probably tax law. Until the loophole was closed, unmarried couples could claim twice as much tax relief on their mortgage interest as husbands and wives, who were treated as one person.) As Stephen Cretney of All Souls College, Oxford, one of the country's leading family law academics, told an Oxford seminar on marriage and cohabitation last April: \"Almost every piece of family legislation enacted in England and Wales in the past century has actually worked out in a way radically different from the policy presented to the legislature as justifying the legislation in question, and has often had results quite different from those which the initiators really intended.\"",

      "body": "<p>The letter he sent off to the Opera House was classic Raymond Gubbay. Cheeky, eloquent, gobby Gubbay. The impresario who has spent the past 30 years putting on opera for the people - opera with red roses for Valentine lovers, opera for kiddies with teddy bears, singalonganopera for those who like to join in - was applying for the job of executive director at the Royal Opera House. Of course, it made the headlines. He made sure it did by sending copies of the application to newspapers. Not only that, he prefaced it with a press release of Raymond Gubbay Ltd's latest show, Aida. What an operator! </p> <p>The newspapers laughed. The mere notion of a businessman, a barrow boy, running the Opera House! \"It would be like asking the Grim Reaper to run an old people's home,\" said one music critic. But when I question the experts closely they are more reluctant to dismiss Gubbay. His business skills speak for themselves, he loves opera, he understands the workings of the Opera House, and actually when it comes down to it there isn't an obvious candidate. </p> <p>Gubbay shuffles to the door of his north London house and welcomes me in. His trousers and shirt are on the smart side - but somehow he gives the impression of being a scruff. A schloch, as his parents might have said. </p> <p>He leaves me in the lounge. At least, I think it's the lounge. It looks like a cross between the Palace of Versailles and a car boot sale. Porcelain, antique cabinets, paintings, candelabra, trinkets and so many clocks that I lose count after the first 20. He says it's all a bit of fun, this collecting lark. Whenever I point to a piece, he recounts its history in detail. I ask him how much a cabinet is worth. His tongue darts over his top lip, his eyebrows ride up and down his huge forehead like dancing caterpillars. He puts his hand across his mouth and burbles bashfully, \"It's quite a nice piece actually.\" </p> <p>You don't often find him bashful. He certainly wasn't bashful in his 12-point manifesto, attacking the system of \"friends\" that means up to 80% of seats are already spoken for before they reach the box office; the broken promises to reduce prices and increase the number of shows. His office warns me that he has already said as much as he can say in the application, that I can't expect him to put the boot in any further. </p> <p>But how could Gubbay waste the opportunity? Perhaps I'm the ideal person for Gubbay to make his case to - late 30s, decent job, interested in the arts, wouldn't dream of going to Covent Garden. \"Part of the problem is that it doesn't touch you,\" he says. \"It's not very accessible. All this public money has gone into it ...\" And he's off. \"If you've got a public building with \u00a320m worth of subsidy thrown in and \u00a378.5m lottery money, the last thing you want is a structure that doesn't allow the maximum number of people to go to the box office and buy tickets.\" </p> <p>Then there is the run of disastrous managers. Genista McIntosh, for one. But didn't she leave because of bad health? \"It depends whose story you believe.\" What about the hoo-ha surrounding Mary Allen and Peter Gummer, latterly Lord Chadlington? \"Suddenly the people giving out the lottery money were at the receiving end because they were now running the Opera House. That was a disgrace, a quite appalling situation.\" </p> <p>And let's not forget Michael Kaiser, the current executive director. \"Six months after the Opera House reopened in December he'd given in his resignation. There's something clearly wrong with the structure of the place when the guy who I feel is doing a very good job within the parameters finds he doesn't want to stay on.\" </p> <p>And the current head, chairman Colin Southgate? \"Why the head of EMI should suddenly find himself running the Opera House without any accountability I can't understand.\" </p> <p>Problem. Southgate has a big say in choosing the new chief executive. Calling him names isn't going to help his cause is it? \"I'm afraid I'm not a crowd pleaser. If they don't want to hear the truth that's up to them.\" </p> <p>Everyone says that what they like about Gubbay is that he's straightforward. And he is. But he's also clever, calculating. And what better way of publicising yourself and your new Aida than applying for this job? He smiles. \"Well, why miss an opportunity? But the letter is not a joke. It's well constructed, literate if I say so myself.\" Will they give it due consideration? \"I don't know. They've never responded positively to anything I've said before. In one of the papers I saw that the press officer at the Opera House said they didn't even know if it was serious. Well surely they've learned by now that discretion is the better part of valour.\" Those amazing eyebrows go dancing again. </p> <p>Surely discretion works both ways, though? If he really wanted the job wouldn't he have been better off not leaking it to the world? \"No, I think I would have had less chance because it would have gone straight into the rubbish.\" At least, he says, this had opened up the debate. \"If the effect of my application is to lift the lid on this thing then that's a good thing. There's a great deal of anger felt by people about how this organisation has devoured vast sums of public money ... and I've not even started to talk to you about what happened during the closure period when they were paid their grant for not appearing ...\" </p> <p>Gubbay, who is 54, does not consider himself an opera buff even though he has dedicated most of his professional life to it. As a seven-year-old he failed grade one piano (\"And no one does that\"), but he liked his music. On Saturdays his grandmother would take him to the Golders Green Hippodrome to see musicals and ballets and D'Oyly Carte. His father wanted his youngest son to follow him into accountancy, and after Gubbay grabbed five O-levels he got himself articled. Eight months on, he was six months behind with his course work and he gave up. He eventually won himself a job working for impresario Victor Hochauser by answering three questions correctly - yes he went to school in north London, yes he was Jewish and yes he could start on Monday. By the mid-60s he was promoting his own shows. </p> <p>Bing! Dringgg! Brrr!! Gong! Ding! All the clocks are going, one after another. \"Don't take any notice. They're probably all wrong.\" He looks at his watch. \"That one's right, actually.\" Don't they drive him mad? \"No. I love it. It's the heartbeat of the house.\" </p> <p>Who lives in the house? \"Me, just me,\" he says quickly. There are pictures of children scattered around the room. Is he divorced? \"I'm divorced, yes, yes.\" Perhaps the clocks drove his wife away? \"Probably. Probably, it drove her out, yes. Though I don't think I had so many in those days.\" He laughs, but you sense Gubbay is a rather private man. </p> <p>His children are grown up, and until he died his father lived in a bungalow built for him in Gubbay's garden. Family is important to him. He talks about how one of his three grandchildren was born just before his mother, who had Alzheimer's, died. \"She was quite lucid at the end and saw my grandson. She said 'How lovely' ... the continuity of life.\" </p> <p>Gubbay likes to say that he was born in Cricklewood, brought up in Golders Green, married in Barnet, and divorced in Hadley Green. But he also has an apartment in the centre of Paris where he spends a couple of months a year enjoying the culture, the restaurants the antique shops. The suburban barrow boy is a bit of a closet bohemian. </p> <p>He tells me he read in the papers the other day that he was a multi-millionaire and wondered who on earth they were talking about. A couple of minutes later he admits that he almost sold his company for \"several million\" last year. </p> <p>The biggest reservation about Gubbay taking over as chief executive of Covent Garden is that he would bring his middle England staple to the Opera House. I tell him that a friend of mine said he had created opera for a new elite, opera for the fuel-protester class. He rocks his head back and laughs and laughs and laughs. \"I like that ... that is rather nice.\" The most radical part of his manifesto is to strip away subsidy, to use it only for specific projects such as encouraging children into the opera. \"Covent Garden gets by far the largest single grant, and many organisations are going out of business because they are not getting the subsidy, and their need is in the thousands rather than millions. If you can save some of this money at Covent Garden you can divert it to much more deserving causes.\" But without subsidy wouldn't the more adventurous stuff get dumped? \"There is a danger of overpopularising,\" he says. \"It's a delicate balance.\" But he has no intention of reducing the repertoire, and no he doesn't think it would be appropriate to impose singalonganopera nights on Covent Garden, \"though I don't think there's any harm in going out to market something in a different way.\" </p> <p>Gubbay tells me that tomorrow he's got a big day ahead of him. He is to receive a second honorary fellowship, this time from Trinity College of Music. He's tickled and excited. \"I'm in danger of becoming respectable,\" he says. Does that frighten him? \"It conjures up a picture of the establishment, which is anathema to me.\" Give that man the job.</p>",

A fascinating piece of research by Professor Michael Zander suggests that it may all have to do with the meaning of the word \"sure\" - what juries and magistrates alike have to feel, about a defendant's guilt, before they can convict. According to the research in the latest New Law Journal, more than half the general public - potential jurors - would need to be 100% sure before convicting, whereas only 31% of magistrates felt they had to be 100% sure.</p> <p>Clearly, if so many magistrates find defendants guilty using a lower level of certainty than juries, they will have a higher rate of conviction. QED. Unfortunately, Zander himself doesn't take that view - insufficient evidence, he says.

Yes but surely there are defendants being convicted by magistrates applying the 90% test who would be acquitted by juries insisting on the hundred. All this pre-supposes that you can assess a percentage on a feeling like \"being sure\". I'm not sure I can tell the difference between 95, 90 or 85% certainty. But I know what 100% means.</p> <p>So farewell, then, stipendiary magistrates. They've slipped away with hardly anyone noticing, after 250 years in the job. Not many people outside the law knew what stipendiary meant - it's only another word for paid, to distinguish them from the lay magistracy - but it sounded important. They started off at Bow Street in the mid-18th century and were paid because the unpaid, amateur justices of the peace of the time were only too bribable; creating a new class of professional, paid magistrates would remove the temptation to be corrupt and raise the standard of justice.</p> <p>Henry Fielding, author of Tom Jones, was among the first; he and his half-brother, the blind John Fielding, were instrumental in founding the Bow Street Runners, which was to become the Metropolitan Police, in 1829. The job of stipendiary magistrate hasn't disappeared, though, only the name. The 100 or so stipes are now formally known as district judge (magistrates' courts), confusingly shortened to DJ, which to me is either a disc jockey or a dinner jacket, depending on the context.</p> <p>\"Open government means the government publishing information largely for its own purposes, information that the government thinks we ought to know or might like to know.

Open government is for governments.' \"</p> <p>I've spent an inordinate and unhealthy proportion of my working life fulminating against television programmes, films and books which get courtroom scenes or other legal events wrong. Mistakes such as judges wearing full-bottomed wigs in court, or the grafting of bits of American procedures on to English trials, drive me mad. The biggest culprit is the gavel, that ghastly wooden artefact that American judges keep banging. But English judges, despite what you may have seen on the screen, do not, repeat <b> not</b>, have gavels.</p> <p>Recently, I was beginning to think I was winning my war against the dreaded thing - in two successive TV programmes, judges were seen without one. Imagine my distress when idly looking into the window of the leading legal bookshop, Hammicks of Fleet Street, when there it was, in the middle of the display, grossly winking at me, sniggering with undisguised contempt. What an example for the bookshop to set for young television producers. I can just hear them: \"Oh well, it must be right if Hammicks have one. We must make sure to have a gavel in our very next production.\" And what a setback for my campaign. I considered throwing a brick at the window, but then thought that it might interfere with the bookshop's selling of that excellent yet cheap Penguin masterwork, The Law Machine, by Berlins and Dyer.</p>",

Mistakes such as judges wearing full-bottomed wigs in court, or the grafting of bits of American procedures on to English trials, drive me mad. The biggest culprit is the gavel, that ghastly wooden artefact that American judges keep banging. But English judges, despite what you may have seen on the screen, do not, repeat not, have gavels. Recently, I was beginning to think I was winning my war against the dreaded thing - in two successive TV programmes, judges were seen without one. Imagine my distress when idly looking into the window of the leading legal bookshop, Hammicks of Fleet Street, when there it was, in the middle of the display, grossly winking at me, sniggering with undisguised contempt. What an example for the bookshop to set for young television producers. I can just hear them: \"Oh well, it must be right if Hammicks have one. We must make sure to have a gavel in our very next production.\" And what a setback for my campaign. I considered throwing a brick at the window, but then thought that it might interfere with the bookshop's selling of that excellent yet cheap Penguin masterwork, The Law Machine, by Berlins and Dyer.",

Partly because the sexual status of a relationship is often seen as a barometer for the whole thing, but also because sex and youth are considered synonymous, admitting to a quasi-platonic relationship is like accepting that you no longer enjoy spending all night sweating class A drugs through every pore while lip-synching to Craig David.

While they may be useful, sex surveys and reports do influence the way we consider what we do with our bodies. They couch the things we once just liked but didn't think about much. What was once an interesting thing you did with rope becomes sadomasochism, with a whole associated behavioural pattern and psychological profile. Each tumble in the hay becomes a session with the mini shrink inside every one of us. In a long-term relationship, in which joint emotional histories are an inevitable factor, maybe it all just gets a bit too complicated. \u0095 All couples' names have been changed.",

      "body": "<p>Frank Gehry, architect of the much-lauded Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, was awarded the Royal Gold Medal for Architecture last week in the early 17th-century splendour of the Banqueting Hall, Whitehall. At 71, the Canadian-born architect has been around for some time, slowly evolving a style of architecture that is as curvaceous, as theatrical, and apparently as wilful as, say, the Baroque masters of the 17th century in Rome. In fact, one might say that Gehry is a Baroque architect of the turn of the 21st century. And, given that his most recently completed building is the Experience Music Project in Seattle, designed in the guise of what appears to be a melted-down cherry-red Fender Stratocaster, Baroque'n'roll is a label that suits him: full-blast, irreverent and, for the most part, pretty wonderful. </p> <p>His architecture is rightly popular among clients who have proved to be remarkably catholic in their taste and among a global public ever more greedy for sensation. Gehry really is of the moment: he has been conjuring the kind of fantastic architecture that global-brand-era capitalism feels it needs. In the same way, the glorious extravaganzas of Bernini, Borromini and Guarani gave the Roman Catholic church a shot in the surplice at the outset of the 17th century. </p> <p>Then the great religion was, in Latin countries, that of the one, true, universal church; 400 years on it is consumerism, leisure and their offspring, culture, as housed in thriving and ostentatious new galleries and museums. Where Borromini's curvaceous churches and Bernini's unashamedly erotic sculpture The Ecstasy of St Theresa (at the Capella Cornaro, St Maria della Vittoria, Rome) were designed covertly to inflame the excitement and ultimately the loyalty of the wealthy faithful, Gehry's exotic designs help keep the idea going that a collusion of ultra-wealth and culture is the high point of our society. </p> <p>In his acceptance speech last week, Gehry avoided pretty much all mention of the Bilbao Guggenheim; it has become almost too famous, the architectural equivalent of Frank Sinatra's My Way. Yet this truly iconic building - an icon of the capitalism-into-culture equation - has proved to be massively popular. It has whipped in the crowds and helped funnel investment into the Basque capital, most of it from the private sector. </p> <p>What Bernini did for Rome at the height of the Counter-Reformation, Gehry has done, in the design of one building, for Bilbao. </p> <p>Gehry's finest buildings are nearly all the products of private enterprise at its most confident. The Experience Music Project, which opened in June, was financed by Paul Allen, the Microsoft billionaire. The Guggenheim was a gift to Bilbao from the coffers of a New York plutocrat made rich decades ago on Yukon gold. Gehry's other European contributions - the Vitra design museum in Weil-am-Rhein, the Maggie Jencks cancer care centre in Dundee, the Marques de Riscal winery and hotel in Elciego (due to open in 2003) and the Neue Zollhof waterfront development in Dusseldorf - are the ripe fruit of wealthy private patrons or development corporations comfortably fed by big business. </p> <p>Gehry's effervescent approach to design will no doubt similarly appeal to a new generation of successful dot.com entrepreneurs. As capitalism goes into a kind of baroque overdrive, so the architecture that frames it has become increasingly flamboyant, from the casino strips of Las Vegas, through the profitable Po-Mo kitsch of Canary Wharf and New York's Battery Park, to the extravagant new wave of shopping malls, museums and galleries that have become part and parcel of the entertainment industry. </p> <p>This said, Gehry rarely fails to delight, and, just as you can't look at a 17th-century Roman Baroque church without thinking of the horrors of the Inquisition that lurked behind its whimsical split pediments and cutesy cherubs, so it is impossible not to revel in Gehry's irreverent artistry without thinking of the sheer might of the global industries that increasingly fuel this and other architecture like it. Like a successful advertising agency wooing a large public with controversial images and slogans, Gehry is, for all his outward flamboyance, a rationalist at heart. Just like the Baroque masters. </p> <p>In a quiet, self-deprecating talk last week, Gehry said that although he owed much to computer programming to help with the construction of his apparently convoluted buildings, he still believed in the primacy of good old-fashioned model making and the messy process of down-to-earth building. Most of the audience at the gold medal award last week would have been well aware of Gehry's roots as a clean-cut, four-square Modernist, who learned to find his own language, one that does for modern museums and business institutions what that dress did for Elizabeth Hurley. </p> <p>It is harder, of course, to imagine Gehry being invited to let rip in Little England. His taste may be rather too Las Vegas for London, Liverpool or Leeds. When British architects did go Baroque - in the late 17th century with Wren, Hawksmoor, Vanbrugh and co - their style, with the exception of Vanbrugh, who had travelled extensively, was far more chaste than that of their Latin counterparts. This is partly because they were building for a Protestant establishment and partly a question of gentlemanly restraint. Significantly, these architects took their cue from Inigo Jones (1573-1652), the unrepentantly Catholic architect who designed the peerless Banqueting Hall under whose lavish ceiling Gehry received his gold medal. Jones, a designer of court masques, had spent several years in Italy, notably in Venice, but although surrounded by increasingly voluptuous new churches and palaces, he believed that architecture \"should be solid, proportional according to the rules [of the classical orders], masculine and unaffected\". Yet his revolutionary buildings - and, above all, the Banqueting House in the heart of half-timbered Jacobean London - would have been as shockingly new when completed in 1622 as Gehry's Bilbao Guggenheim was to be 375 years later. </p> <p>What if Gehry were to receive a major commission in these islands? Would the spirit of Jones and Wren lure him into a quieter, Protestant Baroque? Possibly. Certainly the medal ceremony, despite the fleshy excess of the Rubens ceiling billow ing above the audience, remained a cosily low-key English affair. No massive, US-style prize money, no extravagant speeches; just a school prize day atmosphere in which a small, white-haired septuagenarian mumbled through an address that belied what he has been doing outside the Portland stone walls of the Banqueting Hall - creating some of the most theatrical and in-your-face architecture this side of Bernini.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Tuesday July 9 1996 is marked simply with a large black spot in my diary. How else would you denote the worst day of your life? My daughters Josie and Megan had been trying out Brownies after school, and Lin had accepted an offer from her friend Liz Gregson to take them there with her daughter at about 5 o'clock that evening. So Lin told me not to worry if they were home late, and I told her I would probably also be working late but that I would cook supper if I got home first. Lin kissed me quickly goodbye as we hurried off to school, and the last time I saw her alive was as she turned to walk back to the house through her lovely garden, with the dogs trotting happily at her side. At Goodnestone I dropped the girls off outside the school, where I last remember them clad in their pale blue gingham summer dresses running off to join their classmates. </p> <p>At about seven that evening, I decided to return home, arriving at about 7.30 to an empty house with only our old retriever, Jackie, to greet me. I was slightly surprised, as I thought that if the family had gone to Brownies at 5pm then they should have been back by now. I assumed that they had stayed on for extra activities, or gone home with Liz Gregson and her daughter for a while. I vaguely thought that Lin might have rung me to confirm this, but there was no message on the answering machine. So I quickly set about making the dinner. At around 8.30pm the phone rang and I rushed to it, expecting Lin to be on the other end. But it was Liz, who told me that she had called at 5pm to take Lin and the girls to Brownies, but that the house was shut up with nobody home. </p> <p>A feeling of unease spread over me as my mind raced for explanations. I told Liz the only reason I could think of for Lin's absence would be that Lucy, our dog, had escaped off the lead and got lost. I knew that Lin would scour the countryside in such a situation. Or perhaps Lucy had been involved in an accident and Lin had prevailed on someone to take them to the vets. But I could tell that Liz was worried. I said I'd telephone the local vets and she said she'd call back a bit later to see what I had found out. </p> <p>I started phoning, only to find answering machines with messages to the effect that they were not open at this time. On an impulse I jumped into the car and drove along the road to Sandwich, turning up Cherry Garden Lane as twilight crept across the land. Why I thought they might still be somewhere along the route home from school I do not know, but I had to satisfy myself that they were not coming home late along there. I was still clinging on to the escaped Lucy notion. As I entered the tunnel of vegetation that enclosed the entrance to the lane, it was darkening and I switched the car's lights on briefly to see ahead. I drove swiftly up the bumpy track and emerged at the far end without seeing a soul. I had driven, without knowing it, just a few feet from where my family were lying in the bushes beside the track. I drove on all the way to the school at Goodnestone and then back again, but there was no sign of Lin and the girls. </p> <p>It was now 9pm and I started an increasingly urgent round of calls, first to the local police station, which put me through to an operations centre that told me there had been no accidents reported that evening in our part of Kent. Over the next hour I rang hospitals further and further afield, but none had admitted anybody by the name of Russell, or fitting the descriptions of my family. </p> <p>Just after 10pm, Liz rang back to hear my quavering voice on the other end of the phone telling her that Lin and the girls were missing. She shouted to her husband John to get the car out, they were coming over straight away, and as soon as she hung up I was on the phone again to the local police station. They now seemed genuinely concerned. The officer took down my descriptions of Lin and the girls, and where their last movements might have been. I was asked the inevitable questions about whether we had had an argument, or might Lin have had any other reason to take the kids away without my knowledge or consent. By now I was too worried to be overly concerned at the suggestion. The officer said that he would dispatch two constables to the house at once to get more details from me. </p> <p>Liz and John arrived, followed by the police at about 11pm. I started giving them more thorough descriptions and telling them what I had already done that evening to find Lin and the girls. It was late enough now that I felt no embarrassment at calling out the police, but I was still clinging to the notion that a benign explanation could be found for Lin's and the girls' disappearance. The worst thing that I now considered was that one of them might have been involved in an accident. I tried to avert painful thoughts of one or other of the girls being hit by a car as they walked down the narrow lanes near to home. It never entered my mind that something more sinister might have befallen them. </p> <p>The questioning continued and frustration started to impinge on the feeling of fear for my family's safety that was now consuming me. How long would this go on before the police started to do something? The question was answered almost immediately as, at about 11.30pm, a bus full of police officers skidded into the gravel driveway next to Granary Cottage, accompanied by a white van with a dog search team. At about midnight they set off in the direction of Cherry Garden Lane. </p> <p>Now I was starting to go numb with worry. My brain was not allowing me to think beyond hospitalisation for one of the girls as the worst possible scenario. I was hanging on in a kind of limbo, with the vague hope that someone would arrive with Lin and the girls smiling and embarrassed in the back of their car, and some sort of rational explanation for it all. </p> <p>I accepted another cup of tea from Liz and John and we spoke very little as we paced up and down outside in the driveway in the darkness. Lights glowed in police cars parked at the end of the drive, and radios crackled. Suddenly, at about 1am, another police car pulled into the parking area near to the houses. From the darkness emerged the two officers who had questioned me earlier. One spoke quietly to Liz and John while the other asked me in a subdued voice to accompany him back into the house. </p> <p>Somehow I knew at that moment that the worst had happened. As we walked towards the house I trembled with dread. I had seen it in the movies a hundred times, and now this poor policeman was making the same moves, the same body language. We sat down at the kitchen table, with me still clutching my empty mug of tea, hardly able to breathe. He spoke quietly and with a quaver in his voice. </p> <p>\"I'm sorry to have to tell you, Dr Russell, that we have found your family, not far from here, and they have been in some sort of accident. It's very difficult for me to tell you this, but I'm afraid none of them has survived.\" </p> <p>If I was numb before, now I entered a state of complete suspended animation. My external functioning switched on to autopilot and I drifted away into a kind of grey oblivion. Mentally, I had nowhere to go, nowhere to escape. The enormity of what was being told to me removed with one crushing blow any chance of optimism or happiness in my life. I have a vague recollection of seeing myself, as though from the outside, performing as if I were in a movie. I could hear myself slowly asking the policeman: Where? When? How? Surely not all of them? </p> <p>He could only answer falteringly himself. He explained that the circumstances were suspicious, there seemed to have been some sort of attack. He said that in all his career he had never had to do anything so terrible as this. Liz and John shuffled into the kitchen, eyes red with tears; they had been told by the other policeman what had happened. They hugged me but I was cold and distant. </p> <p>\"Would you like some more tea?\" </p> <p>\"No thanks.\" </p> <p>\"We will have to ask you to come to the police station in Deal to answer some more questions.\" </p> <p>\"OK.\" </p> <p>\"We will have to seal off the house tonight, would you like to sleep over with friends or relatives?\" </p> <p>\"No thanks, I'll come with you now.\" </p> <p>In my dazed state I started showing the police and my friends how to feed the cats and the dogs, and I asked them to be sure that there would be someone around to care for them and the ponies. John and Liz assured me that they would look after the animals. </p> <p>I could not bring myself to ask any more detail of the police. Instead I turned in on myself, so that by the time a police car was detailed to carry me in the early hours of the morning to Deal police station I huddled up in the back like a lost and beaten child. Once out of sight of friends and neighbours, and in the darkness of the car with only an unknown police officer sitting beside me, I finally broke down. I remember shrieking with pain, and the tears rolling down my face. I shouted and swore, which I never normally do. \"What has happened to them? Where are they? Why has this happened?\" </p> <p>In the heat of my rage my train of thought suddenly became more rational. \"They were everything to me. Now they have gone, I have nothing left. Therefore there is no reason to go on living.\" And I started whining, \"There must be an easy way out. Someone help me. Isn't there some sort of injection? It can't be too hard to find.\" The police officers tried to comfort me as best they could. But I could tell they longed for the cross-country journey down the winding east Kent lanes to be over. And in my delirium I too yearned for my life's journey to be over. </p> <p>Later that morning, at about 6am, Ed Tingley - one of the family liaison officers who had been called to look after me - came into my room in Deal police station with a serious expression on his face. What he had to tell me changed everything. </p> <p>He said that, although they had initially thought all of my family were dead, one of the children had survived. She had been rushed to a London hospital during the night, and was now on life support in an intensive care unit. My brain was galvanised with hope. There was a reason to go on after all. </p> <p>The police and the hospital wanted to know which one of my daughters had survived. Ed asked me to describe them, and I told him that Josie had longer hair, whereas Megan's was cut shorter. He phoned the hospital and was told that the child in their care had short hair and so it was most likely to be Megan. </p> <p>We arrived at King's College Hospital, south-east London. We were passed from reception to the head injuries unit and led to the front door of the intensive care unit. A nurse ushered us in and pointed across to the nearest bed. Lying on it, half submerged beneath a mass of pipes, wires and tapes, was a small, heavily bandaged figure. Her face was black and blue and puffed up like a balloon. Her eyes were tight shut, but by the freckles across the top of her nose above the oxygen mask, I knew her instantly to be Josie. I shouted out: \"It's Josie!\" before I was halfway across the room. Here was my reason for living, and if all she did was breathe, that would be enough for me. </p> <p>Josie Russell had major skull fracturing, and serious brain damage impaired her speech. A week after the attack she was told that her mother and sister were dead. Later, Shaun Russell took her home to Granary Cottage for the first time. </p> <p>On Saturday August 3, Josie finally got what she wanted and was able to lead me to our car, open the door and get in. Josie's favourite nurse, Marlene, had given up her day off to accompany us. </p> <p>We pulled into the back yard and Josie immediately got out of the car and walked like a zombie towards the house. She tugged at the door until I caught up with her to open it. Once in the house Josie stood staring at everything that must have reminded her of her mother and sister and the life she had lost. She started upstairs with a wail growing in her throat, and burst into her bedroom. Her howling grew stronger and more anguished and she rushed through to Megan's room, grabbing one of her sister's teddies still on the dressing table. Then she plunged on into Lin's and my room, where Lin's clothes were still visible hanging on a rail. Josie was sobbing violently now and moaning like a wounded animal between her coughs and splutterings. </p> <p>Josie continued her lament around the house for what seemed like an age, as we longed for her to cry herself out. Outside, the Kelly family had arrived with Josie's school friend Jazzmin. I pleaded with Josie to calm down and that Jazzmin was here to see her now. Slowly Josie started to settle and after a while was ready to go outside to see her old friend. Josie walked slowly out, and Jazzmin gingerly approached her. They came close, and Jazzmin handed Josie a little present. A smile flickered across Josie's face as she recognised Jazzmin, and I suggested to them that they go along the lane to see the ponies. Pauline, Marlene and I accompanied the two girls as they walked slowly ahead of us, Jazzmin talking softly to Josie. All Josie could say by way of reply was \"uh\" or \"mm\", or similar noises. But Jazzmin was not fazed at all; she acted as if she didn't even notice Josie's loss of intelligible speech. </p> <p>We rounded the corner of the copse of trees that separated our house from the ponies' field. There in the distance were Tegid and Rosie. Josie looked across at them, with a quizzical expression on her face, as though she was not sure if these really were her ponies. But as they shambled across towards us, she ducked under the electric fence and moved quickly to meet them. She was smiling now and she reached out to greet her ponies with arms at full stretch. As Tegid came up she wrapped her arms around his neck and the tears flowed down her face. It was such a relief to see Josie crying with something akin to happiness. </p> <p>Almost a year later, after a series of interviews with Josie, family liaison officers were able to piece together a detailed picture of the events of July 9 1996. </p> <p>All I knew then and now is the following. At 4pm, Josie and Megan returned on the school bus from their swimming gala in Canterbury. Lin and Lucy were waiting for them, and they started on their normal walk home across the rape field behind Goodnestone, through the Woodpecker Wood and over the gate on to the by-road that leads past the entrance to Cherry Garden Lane. They walked down the lane to where it curves to the right and heard a car behind them. They stood aside from the car, and Josie waved to the driver as he passed. His face was grim and he did not acknowledge their greeting. </p> <p>After he had passed they walked on around the corner to find his car parked broadside across the track. It was a few yards before the entrance to the Mount Ephraim house where Lin and the girls would have turned off the lane along the footpath to the Bruderhof community's grounds. If the bus had been back from swimming three minutes earlier, they would have been off the lane and along the path before the murderer drove by. If, if, if ... </p> <p>The man got out of the car and reached in through the back window for a hammer on the rear shelf. He faced Lin and the girls and, according to Josie, he demanded money. Lin would not have been carrying any money with her on the school walk and she told him she had none. The murderer menaced them, and Lin asked him if he would come home with them and she would find him some money there. The man said: \"No.\" I don't know if Lin urged Josie to run for her life at this point, or whether the man started beating Lin first. There is evidence to the effect that the man grabbed Megan and double looped a bootlace or drug tourniquet around her neck to hold her. Lin may have been rendered powerless by this hostage-taking. Josie has said that she ran away \"when Lin was nearly dead\", but this may mean that it all happened at once: Lin attempting to free Megan but receiving the first hammer blows; Josie seeing her mother injured and hearing Lin shouting for her to run away; Josie breaking away and running to the gate at Mount Ephraim; and the man running after her and dragging her back. </p> <p>Forensic evidence and Josie's testimony point to the murderer then shepherding them all into the bushes and seating them on the ground. He methodically tore the damp towels from the girls' swimming bags into strips, and with these and their own shoelaces, he bound and gagged them. He tied Josie to a tree and asked her if the bindings were not too uncomfortable. He then walked around behind each victim in turn and rained down blows on their heads with his hammer until he felt that he had done enough. Josie remembers hearing Lin's dying cries. He meted out the same treatment to our dog, Lucy, although Josie does not remember at what stage of the murder our pet was killed. The whole encounter took about 15 minutes. </p> <p>To write those few paragraphs in the summer of 2000, four years after the event, has required an immense effort of willpower. I have had to stare at my computer screen through a continuous stream of tears with my stomach churning and my heart pounding. </p> <p>My mind wants constantly to leap on beyond the bald facts of movements and action, to how they must all have been feeling. The uncomprehending terror of my innocent and loving children at seeing and hearing their mother being beaten mercilessly and crying out in pain. Lin's horror and desperation in her last moments as, bound and gagged, injured and dying, her last hopes would have been for the survival of her children against the slaughter that was raining down on them. </p> <p>That is why I don't want to know any more. Isn't it enough? I know better than any other how my wife and children acted and felt. Putting myself in their minds at the time of their death is like inviting death or madness upon myself. I could not save them; I must at least try to save myself. </p> <p>In October 1998, Michael Stone, who has a personality disorder, was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of Lin and Megan Russell and the attempted murder of Josie. He is to appeal against the decision. Josie Russell is now in her second year at high school. </p> <p>\u00a9 Shaun Russell.

      "bodyText": "Tuesday July 9 1996 is marked simply with a large black spot in my diary. How else would you denote the worst day of your life? My daughters Josie and Megan had been trying out Brownies after school, and Lin had accepted an offer from her friend Liz Gregson to take them there with her daughter at about 5 o'clock that evening. So Lin told me not to worry if they were home late, and I told her I would probably also be working late but that I would cook supper if I got home first. Lin kissed me quickly goodbye as we hurried off to school, and the last time I saw her alive was as she turned to walk back to the house through her lovely garden, with the dogs trotting happily at her side. At Goodnestone I dropped the girls off outside the school, where I last remember them clad in their pale blue gingham summer dresses running off to join their classmates. At about seven that evening, I decided to return home, arriving at about 7.30 to an empty house with only our old retriever, Jackie, to greet me. I was slightly surprised, as I thought that if the family had gone to Brownies at 5pm then they should have been back by now. I assumed that they had stayed on for extra activities, or gone home with Liz Gregson and her daughter for a while. I vaguely thought that Lin might have rung me to confirm this, but there was no message on the answering machine. So I quickly set about making the dinner. At around 8.30pm the phone rang and I rushed to it, expecting Lin to be on the other end. But it was Liz, who told me that she had called at 5pm to take Lin and the girls to Brownies, but that the house was shut up with nobody home. A feeling of unease spread over me as my mind raced for explanations. I told Liz the only reason I could think of for Lin's absence would be that Lucy, our dog, had escaped off the lead and got lost. I knew that Lin would scour the countryside in such a situation. Or perhaps Lucy had been involved in an accident and Lin had prevailed on someone to take them to the vets. But I could tell that Liz was worried. I said I'd telephone the local vets and she said she'd call back a bit later to see what I had found out. I started phoning, only to find answering machines with messages to the effect that they were not open at this time. On an impulse I jumped into the car and drove along the road to Sandwich, turning up Cherry Garden Lane as twilight crept across the land. Why I thought they might still be somewhere along the route home from school I do not know, but I had to satisfy myself that they were not coming home late along there. I was still clinging on to the escaped Lucy notion. As I entered the tunnel of vegetation that enclosed the entrance to the lane, it was darkening and I switched the car's lights on briefly to see ahead. I drove swiftly up the bumpy track and emerged at the far end without seeing a soul. I had driven, without knowing it, just a few feet from where my family were lying in the bushes beside the track. I drove on all the way to the school at Goodnestone and then back again, but there was no sign of Lin and the girls. It was now 9pm and I started an increasingly urgent round of calls, first to the local police station, which put me through to an operations centre that told me there had been no accidents reported that evening in our part of Kent. Over the next hour I rang hospitals further and further afield, but none had admitted anybody by the name of Russell, or fitting the descriptions of my family. Just after 10pm, Liz rang back to hear my quavering voice on the other end of the phone telling her that Lin and the girls were missing. She shouted to her husband John to get the car out, they were coming over straight away, and as soon as she hung up I was on the phone again to the local police station. They now seemed genuinely concerned. The officer took down my descriptions of Lin and the girls, and where their last movements might have been. I was asked the inevitable questions about whether we had had an argument, or might Lin have had any other reason to take the kids away without my knowledge or consent. By now I was too worried to be overly concerned at the suggestion. The officer said that he would dispatch two constables to the house at once to get more details from me. Liz and John arrived, followed by the police at about 11pm. I started giving them more thorough descriptions and telling them what I had already done that evening to find Lin and the girls. It was late enough now that I felt no embarrassment at calling out the police, but I was still clinging to the notion that a benign explanation could be found for Lin's and the girls' disappearance. The worst thing that I now considered was that one of them might have been involved in an accident. I tried to avert painful thoughts of one or other of the girls being hit by a car as they walked down the narrow lanes near to home. It never entered my mind that something more sinister might have befallen them. The questioning continued and frustration started to impinge on the feeling of fear for my family's safety that was now consuming me. How long would this go on before the police started to do something? The question was answered almost immediately as, at about 11.30pm, a bus full of police officers skidded into the gravel driveway next to Granary Cottage, accompanied by a white van with a dog search team. At about midnight they set off in the direction of Cherry Garden Lane. Now I was starting to go numb with worry. My brain was not allowing me to think beyond hospitalisation for one of the girls as the worst possible scenario. I was hanging on in a kind of limbo, with the vague hope that someone would arrive with Lin and the girls smiling and embarrassed in the back of their car, and some sort of rational explanation for it all. I accepted another cup of tea from Liz and John and we spoke very little as we paced up and down outside in the driveway in the darkness. Lights glowed in police cars parked at the end of the drive, and radios crackled. Suddenly, at about 1am, another police car pulled into the parking area near to the houses. From the darkness emerged the two officers who had questioned me earlier. One spoke quietly to Liz and John while the other asked me in a subdued voice to accompany him back into the house. Somehow I knew at that moment that the worst had happened. As we walked towards the house I trembled with dread. I had seen it in the movies a hundred times, and now this poor policeman was making the same moves, the same body language. We sat down at the kitchen table, with me still clutching my empty mug of tea, hardly able to breathe. He spoke quietly and with a quaver in his voice. \"I'm sorry to have to tell you, Dr Russell, that we have found your family, not far from here, and they have been in some sort of accident. It's very difficult for me to tell you this, but I'm afraid none of them has survived.\" If I was numb before, now I entered a state of complete suspended animation. My external functioning switched on to autopilot and I drifted away into a kind of grey oblivion. Mentally, I had nowhere to go, nowhere to escape. The enormity of what was being told to me removed with one crushing blow any chance of optimism or happiness in my life. I have a vague recollection of seeing myself, as though from the outside, performing as if I were in a movie. I could hear myself slowly asking the policeman: Where? When? How? Surely not all of them? He could only answer falteringly himself. He explained that the circumstances were suspicious, there seemed to have been some sort of attack. He said that in all his career he had never had to do anything so terrible as this. Liz and John shuffled into the kitchen, eyes red with tears; they had been told by the other policeman what had happened. They hugged me but I was cold and distant. \"Would you like some more tea?\" \"No thanks.\" \"We will have to ask you to come to the police station in Deal to answer some more questions.\" \"OK.\" \"We will have to seal off the house tonight, would you like to sleep over with friends or relatives?\" \"No thanks, I'll come with you now.\" In my dazed state I started showing the police and my friends how to feed the cats and the dogs, and I asked them to be sure that there would be someone around to care for them and the ponies. John and Liz assured me that they would look after the animals. I could not bring myself to ask any more detail of the police. Instead I turned in on myself, so that by the time a police car was detailed to carry me in the early hours of the morning to Deal police station I huddled up in the back like a lost and beaten child. Once out of sight of friends and neighbours, and in the darkness of the car with only an unknown police officer sitting beside me, I finally broke down. I remember shrieking with pain, and the tears rolling down my face. I shouted and swore, which I never normally do. \"What has happened to them? Where are they? Why has this happened?\" In the heat of my rage my train of thought suddenly became more rational. \"They were everything to me. Now they have gone, I have nothing left. Therefore there is no reason to go on living.\" And I started whining, \"There must be an easy way out. Someone help me. Isn't there some sort of injection?

      "bodyText": "Prosecutors are insisting that a retired army officer accused of supplying information to a journalist about surveillance operations in Northern Ireland be tried in secret. Lawyers for the Ministry of Defence are seeking a court ruling to try Lieutenant-Colonel Nigel Wylde behind closed doors on national security grounds, the Guardian has learned. Col Wylde is charged under the Official Secrets Act with providing information to Tony Geraghty whose book, The Irish War, was published in 1998. The book describes the growing use of computers by military intelligence in identifying targets, including automatic photographing of vehicle registration plates. \"In Northern Ireland... at least 1m names are now on some security agency's computer,\" Mr Geraghty wrote. Secrets charges against Mr Geraghty were dropped last December. Col Wylde was awarded the Queen's Gallantry Medal for defusing unexploded bombs in Northern Ireland. After he retired, he became a computer consultant. The MoD's demand for a secret trial is surprising since it made no attempt to stop the book which was published two months before Col Wylde and Mr Geraghty were arrested. More significantly, an MoD damage assessment concluded that the book did not endanger lives or imperil military operations. The MoD now claims the information in the book was damaging and the only way it can explain its case is to reveal new information about sensitive operations. Col Wylde denies the allegations made against him. His trial is due to start at the Old Bailey on November 20.",

The submarines play a key role in protecting ships as well as those submarines armed with the Trident nuclear deterrent. They are also being armed with the navy's latest long-range weapon, the US Tomahawk cruise missile. Four of the fleet of 12 hunter-killers, nuclear-powered but conventionally armed, are undergoing separate refitting work.

The decision to withdraw the fleet follows discovery of a fault in the reactor cooling system of HMS Tireless, which has been moored off Gibraltar since May. On opening up the reactor, engineers found a large crack which could have \"generic implications\", a navy spokesman said yesterday. In August the navy bowed to Gibraltar public opinion and provided the territory's government with classified information on the submarine's reactor, which was designed in the early 1970s. The navy initially described the fault on Tireless as minimal and suggested it could be repaired within weeks. John Large, an independent nuclear consultant advising the Gibraltar government, said yesterday the fault raised serious questions about the navy's quality control system. He described the faulty weld in the cooling system as being \"very near to the reactor itself\". The loss of the hunter-killer fleet is a huge embarrassment to the MoD, coming after problems with the weapons systems of the navy's Sea Harriers and serious faults in the army's standard rifle, the SA80. The navy has recently sold off the last of its conventionally powered submarines. A navy spokesman acknowledged that the decision to withdraw all other submarines except Trident would affect the \"security of Trident\". He declined to say what contingency measures would be taken. Iain Duncan Smith, shadow defence secretary, said: \"Serious questions had to be asked as to why the government has taken so long to make a decision about this when the faults were discovered in May.\" Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrat defence spokesman, said the decision raised questions of capability and credibility.

Born in Ilford, her father worked at Ford's Dagenham factory and she was educated locally at the strict Ursuline Convent. On leaving school she worked for the Bank of England, and later as a secretary for the BBC European Service. She married Robert Holland, a journalist on a local paper who subsequently became a sub-editor on the Times.</p> <p>She began writing at her husband's suggestion; until then she had been a voracious reader of romantic novels. At the time she was living in Felixstowe with three children and wrote her first book, Love in a Mist, for Robert Hale in three days. She wrote a few more for Hale (under both her married and maiden names) before her first novel as Charlotte Lamb, Follow a Stranger, was published by Mills &amp; Boon in 1973.</p> <p>She wrote swiftly, from nine o'clock in the morning in her office overlooking the woods and the sea - a minimum of 2,000 words a day. At her peak in the 1970s, she would sometimes turn out 12,000 words in a day, sitting up all night, or at the kitchen table with her children (now five with the arrival of twins) crawling around her feet. A full-length novel could be finished in four days.</p> <p>Her skill was a naturally strong literary sense with structure and plotting, and an ability to write the kind of novel that she would want to buy. She wrote about powerful and sometimes darkly intense emotions. Lamb was at the forefront of stories that went \"beyond the bedroom door\", a trend that started in a new generation of Mills &amp; Boon writers as a reflection of society's sexual explorations in the 1970s.</p> <p>Her classic was The Long Surrender (1978) which centred on a heroine who was sexually abused as a child and who was subsequently at odds with herself and her sexuality. It was a theme her novels returned to again and again: the heroine who would run away from her feelings and desires rather than confront them. It was the job of Lamb's heroes to help the heroine understand her desires.</p> <p>She was fascinated by the darker side of human nature and especially in finding the trigger that would push her characters over the edge. In her Mills &amp; Boon novels she walked a fine line, her heroes often on the verge of losing control. Her understanding for the dynamics of passion always kept them just on the right side, but they often went to limits other authors never dared approach.</p> <p>This was an area that Lamb explored more freely in her novels outside Mills &amp; Boon, most notably in A Violation (1983), the story of a woman's traumatic life after she was raped by an intruder; and her later novels, In the Still of the Night (1995), Walking in Darkness (1996), Deep and Silent Waters (1998), Treasons of the Heart (1999) and the recently published Angel of Death (2000) were classified as romantic suspense thrillers.</p> <p>In the 1980s, Lamb, now living on the Isle of Man, continued to write historical novels under the names Sheila Lancaster and Laura Hardy, and to push the boundaries of Mills &amp; Boon's quiet and critically unnoticed exploration of forbidden passions and ardour. Her \"Sins\" series examined each of the seven deadly sins in a romantic context; titles which would not have shamed pulp writer Hank Janson - The Silken Trap, Love is a Frenzy, Temptation, Compulsion, Obsession - charted the conflicts in relationships that struggled to survive against the odds.</p> <p>To a whole generation of modern readers, Lamb was a secret best-seller who proved that romance was not all cooing doves, and she was true to this to the end; her final novel, enticingly entitled The Boss's Virgin, will be published next July.</p> <p><b> Sheila Ann Mary Holland (Charlotte Lamb), author, born December 22 1937; died October 8 2000 </b></p>",

The combined teams of Russian and Norwegian divers, who started descending over 100 metres to the Kursk on the Barents sea bed on Friday, cut through the outer hull, stripped away a layer of industrial rubber casing designed to maximise the vessel's stealth, and pierced the tougher inner hull at the stern. Russian navy spokesmen reported that the rescue workers found \"pure water\" inside one compartment. There were no traces of fuel nor of increased radiation from the submarine's two nuclear reactors. Six teams of three divers are working round the clock from a diving platform, resembling a large mobile oil rig, which arrived at the scene of the disaster off the coast of Murmansk on Friday. The recovery effort is being run by the Norwegian arm of the US oil services company Halliburton, but the divers cutting their way into the submarine are Russian. Russia is profoundly ambivalent about the entire operation which is aimed at redeeming President Vladimir Putin's pledge to the families of the 118 dead seamen in August that the corpses would be recovered. Russian navy officers and government officials are braced for failure and, indeed, appear determined to emphasise the gravity of every problem that crops up in what is an extremely difficult operation in bad weather and poor visibility. The Russian pessimism contrasts with the brisk, can-do attitude of the Norwegians. \"Like in the aftermath of the disaster, the political and military leadership seem to think that the public is not ready for the truth,\" commented the Nezavisimaya Gazeta daily newspaper. In the grief-stricken days after two still unexplained explosions during northern fleet exercises sank the Kursk on August 12, the relatives insisted on trying to raise the corpses.

In a speech given when he was sworn in, Mr Kostunica called for a strengthening of ties between Serbia and Kosovo.</p> <p>Under UN resolution 1244 Yugoslavia is entitled eventually to send up to 1,000 troops back to Kosovo for work at border crossings and to guard historical sites. For the UN to grant that right would be \"catastrophic\", the ICG warns, and would alienate Kosovo Albanians overnight.</p> <p>It would be equally disastrous if the Kosovans became convinced that the arrival of a new government had led the international community to rule out independence.</p> <p>To show that the Kosovans' right to self-determination is accepted, the ICG has urged the European Union, which holds a Balkans summit in Zagreb next month, to invite not only Mr Kostunica but also Kosovo Albanian representatives.</p> <p>The Kosovo commission offers five options for Kosovo's future status. Renewing the current United Nations protectorate for an indefinite number of years may seem attractive but Kosovan Albanian impatience might lead to parallel underground institutions or outright rebellion.</p> <p>Partition might satisfy Serbs in Mitrovice but would lead to the forced relocation of most other Serbs as well as the end of the international community's commitment to maintain the multi-ethnic character of all Balkan states.</p> <p>Full independence for Kosovo and the end of the UN mandate would be opposed by Russia and China, create anxieties in neighbouring states, and be resisted by Kosovo's Serb and Roma communities.</p> <p>Autonomy within Yugoslavia is impractical, the commission argues: \"The simple truth is that no Kosovar will accept to live under Serb rule, however notional, ever again.\"</p> <p>The only viable solution, it concludes, is \"conditional independence\".</p> <p>The commission finds that Nato's intervention against Yugoslavia was \"illegal but legitimate\" and criticises Nato for \"major mistakes\" in thinking that the bombing campaign would be short and in not anticipating the Serbian revenge attacks on Kosovan Albanians.</p> <p>It urges the United Nations to \"close the gap between legality and legitimacy\" by preparing a new framework for intervention.</p> <p>It also suggests that the general assembly produce a declaration which would sanctify three principles that would have to be met before any humanitarian intervention could be accepted: massive civilian suffering, the overriding commitment to the direct protection of civilians, and the calculation that the intervention has a reasonable chance of ending the catastrophe.</p>",

The world should consider moving the largely Albanian-populated former province of Serbia to \"conditional independence\", according to a report from a commission set up by the Swedish prime minister, Goran Persson, which will be handed to the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, today. The world would have to guarantee the security of the new state, oversee the protection of human rights for Serbs and other minorities, and integrate Kosovo into the Balkan stability pact, the report says. But world powers must also recognise that although UN resolution 1244, which ended the war in Kosovo, kept the territory within the framework of Yugoslavia, that is not tenable in the long term. In a separate report a respected think tank, the International Crisis Group, says Mr Milosevic's departure makes it imperative to accelerate a decision on Kosovo. It warns that support for hardliners within the Kosovo Albanian community would rise \"if the international community's new-found love affair with Belgrade is seen as compromising Kosovo's desire for independence\". It also says that the west must be careful not to make the wrong gestures to the new Yugoslav president, Vojislav Kostunica. In a speech given when he was sworn in, Mr Kostunica called for a strengthening of ties between Serbia and Kosovo. Under UN resolution 1244 Yugoslavia is entitled eventually to send up to 1,000 troops back to Kosovo for work at border crossings and to guard historical sites. For the UN to grant that right would be \"catastrophic\", the ICG warns, and would alienate Kosovo Albanians overnight. It would be equally disastrous if the Kosovans became convinced that the arrival of a new government had led the international community to rule out independence. To show that the Kosovans' right to self-determination is accepted, the ICG has urged the European Union, which holds a Balkans summit in Zagreb next month, to invite not only Mr Kostunica but also Kosovo Albanian representatives. The Kosovo commission offers five options for Kosovo's future status. Renewing the current United Nations protectorate for an indefinite number of years may seem attractive but Kosovan Albanian impatience might lead to parallel underground institutions or outright rebellion. Partition might satisfy Serbs in Mitrovice but would lead to the forced relocation of most other Serbs as well as the end of the international community's commitment to maintain the multi-ethnic character of all Balkan states. Full independence for Kosovo and the end of the UN mandate would be opposed by Russia and China, create anxieties in neighbouring states, and be resisted by Kosovo's Serb and Roma communities. Autonomy within Yugoslavia is impractical, the commission argues: \"The simple truth is that no Kosovar will accept to live under Serb rule, however notional, ever again.\" The only viable solution, it concludes, is \"conditional independence\". The commission finds that Nato's intervention against Yugoslavia was \"illegal but legitimate\" and criticises Nato for \"major mistakes\" in thinking that the bombing campaign would be short and in not anticipating the Serbian revenge attacks on Kosovan Albanians. It urges the United Nations to \"close the gap between legality and legitimacy\" by preparing a new framework for intervention. It also suggests that the general assembly produce a declaration which would sanctify three principles that would have to be met before any humanitarian intervention could be accepted: massive civilian suffering, the overriding commitment to the direct protection of civilians, and the calculation that the intervention has a reasonable chance of ending the catastrophe.",

      "bodyText": "Germany's chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, stands to receive at least half a million pounds thanks to his taste for beer and a new style of music which has been dubbed 'chancellor rap'. A song based around a remark he made last summer has sold more than 360,000 copies, putting the head of the government and leader of the Social Democratic party at number two in the German charts, ahead of Britney Spears. Copyright experts canvassed by the newspaper Bild am Sonntag estimated that Mr Schr\u00f6der's first, and wholly unwitting, foray into pop had already entitled him to around DM1.5m (\u00a3500,000). More royalties are on the way. The CD for which he unintentionally provided the lyrics has just been released in Austria and Switzerland. The chancellor has said that he wants the proceeds to go to a children's helpline of which his wife, Doris K\u00f6pf, is a patron. The unlikely story began last summer when Mr Schr\u00f6der was touring eastern Germany. While signing autographs on a hot day, he barked at aides: \"Get me a bottle of beer or I'm going on strike here\". The remark was picked up by journalists covering the tour and caught the fancy of a television comedian, Stefan Raab. He knitted the soundbite into a CD with a techno backing track, which was released last month. The song, called Get Me A Bottle Of Beer, was also down loaded from the internet more than 700,000 times in the first 10 days following its release. A copyright lawyer quoted by Bild am Sonntag said the chancellor was entitled to royalties not only as the performer and lyricist but also as the composer, since the rhythm of his staccato command dictates the beat of the song. In addition, he is likely to receive money from the playing of the song on radio programmes and its inclusion on an album. Earlier this year, Raab won notoriety with a Eurovision song contest entry in German baby language. It was entitled Wadde, Hadde, Dudde, Da or What Have You Got There?",

      "bodyText": "Ancient Rome's first and greatest theatre, considered lost forever, has been rebuilt, albeit virtually, to reveal a wonder of the empire. A British-led team of archaeologists has recreated the vast auditorium of the Pompey theatre, which stood for centuries as the prototype for all arenas. Special effects on a stage the size of a football pitch were paid for by emperors keen to court popularity and crowd control methods were invented to stop the 20,000 spectators turning into a mob. Buried beneath some of Rome's most beautiful palaces and squares, the Pompey theatre could not be excavated without destroying swathes of the city centre and generations of archaeologists were forced to abandon the site despite its fame. Descriptions by the ancient historian Pliny of a gigantic structure were dismissed as gross exaggerations. But a two-year study, involving aerial photography, cellar inspections, the sifting of archives, mathematical extrapolations and computers has partially vindicated Pliny. A team led by Richard Beacham, of the University of Warwick, and James Packer, of Northwestern University, Illinois, has built a three-dimensional model using computers. The British Arts and Humanities Research Board funded much of the work. Inaugurated in 55BC by the triumphant general Pompey, more than a century before the Colosseum, the building was Rome's first permanent and largest theatre, with an auditorium almost 152 metres in diameter, and a three-storey facade. The theatre, intended to revive the general's waning popularity, was an integrated leisure complex with enclosed colonnades, galleries and gardens. It was the first major example of the imperial style of architecture in Rome, said Prof Beacham. He added: \"It influenced many subsequent buildings, not just theatres. \"Throughout its history it was one of the great showplaces of the city as well as the venue for many of its most momentous events.\" Emperors used it to bolster their rule by staging spectacles. Seating replicated class divisions: the emperor and senators at the front, aristocrats and generals in the next 14 rows, then officials, priests, vestal virgins and citizens. Foreigners, slaves and women were allowed to watch from the back. \"It was a microcosm of Roman society. All the stratas were laid out before you,\" said Prof Beacham. Riot fears led to an elaborate ticketing system, believed to be the first of its kind, which allocated each person a particular tier, row, seat and exit. Among those who appeared on stage was Nero, playing the lead in Oedipus and the Madness of Hercules, his opera about Troy. By the 6th century AD, the theatre had decayed, but Cassiodorus, the Roman chancellor to King Theodoric, was still in awe: \"One would have thought it more likely for mountains to subside, than this strong building be shaken.\" By the 20th century, the theatre had disappeared into or beneath Rome's Campo dei Fiori, Largo Argentina and Campo Marzio. Prof Beacham's team now hopes to perform \"keyhole archaeology\" by digging to the foundations via a restaurant doorway.",

      "bodyText": "'Eta bomb' kills prison guard A prison officer died in a car bomb explosion in northern Spain yesterday, the latest of 16 killings this year blamed on the Basque separatist group Eta. Maximo Casado Carrera, 44, was leaving home in the Basque capital Vitoria when the device exploded in his garage. He had been on his way to work at a jail where around 40 convicted members of Eta are housed, a prison official said. Reuters, Madrid Ugandan Ebola toll rises to 54 The death toll in the latest outbreak of Ebola fever in northern Uganda has risen to 54, and 10 new cases have been reported. The ministry of health said three people had died in the past 24 hours. The new cases were identified around Gulu, 225 miles north of the capital, Kampala. A total of 149 people have fallen ill with the fever since the outbreak was confirmed on October 14. AP, Kampala Guerrillas held after Iran attack Iranian intelligence ministry agents captured a group of armed opposition guerrillas in Tehran yesterday, a day after a rebel mortar attack in the capital. The official Irna news agency quoted the ministry as saying the Mujahedin Khalq had planned to stage mortar attacks in poor and heavily populated areas of Tehran. The Iraq-based group, Iran's main armed opposition movement, said it had fired mortar rounds at the headquarters of the elite Republican Guards on Saturday night. Reuters, Tehran Tourists trapped in Rio cable car About 40 people, most of them foreign tourists, spent more than an hour in a broken cable car suspended 500 metres above Rio de Janeiro's scenic bay. The car stopped as it was taking the group to Sugar Loaf mountain, which gives panoramic views over the city. Firefighters managed to tow the car to a midway stopover point where the passengers escaped through a hatch. Reuters, Rio de Janeiro Persian queen found by police A crowned mummy, possibly of a Persian queen, has been found by Pakistani police during a raid in the south-western town of Quetta. They said the mummy, estimated to be 2,500 years old, was found packed in a sealed box. It was heavily laden with jewellery, including a crown and a golden plate at her chest. Reuters, Quetta",

In the run-up to Diwali this Friday, the priest and president of Britain's Hindu Federation would usually be preparing for an onrush of worshippers seeking blessings. </p> <p>But yesterday the scores of visitors calling in at the Shree Shakti Mandir temple in Leicester were there to mourn their friend and priest. Mr Purohit, a leading figure in the Hindu community and secretary of the National Association of Hindu Priests, had been murdered, in a brutal, mystifying attack. </p> <p>The 42-year-old's body was discovered by his father and younger brother at an empty house on nearby Harrison Road. He had been stabbed 10 times in the neck, legs, back and lungs. </p> <p>The house is owned by the Purohit family but is currently undergoing renovation. Mr Purohit is believed to have gone there on Thursday night, but the alarm was raised only on Friday morning when a neighbour spotted smoke seeping from the house. </p> <p>The murderer or murderers appeared to have escaped through the first-floor bathroom window, after starting a fire to conceal the crime. A half burned sofa was jammed against the front door and the gas fire was turned on, but unlit. </p> <p>The news has rocked the quiet neighbourhood of Belgrave in the north of Leicester. It's a model of multicultural Britain at its best. Hindus, Sikhs, Muslims and Christians live together happily in the neat, narrow brick terraces. The Carey Hall Baptist church and Shri Guru Ravidass Sikh temple lie within 500 metres of the Hindu temple. </p> <p>No one can understand what prompted Mr Purohit's death. His family insist he had no enemies and the police refuse to speculate as to motives. His car was found yesterday on the other side of Leicester. His mobile phone is still missing. </p> <p>Leicestershire police have not yet recovered the weapon used in the attack and have appealed to people in the area to check their gardens and bins. </p> <p>\"Diwali is just around the corner,\" said Mr Purohit's elder brother, Janardan, 46. \"It's time to get everyone together and enjoy it. But this year it will leave us empty. The link in our family is broken and it can never be mended. </p> <p>Mr Purohit's mother and father, Karunashanker, 83, and Madhukanta, 78, and his four sisters are closeted away with Mr Purohit's long-term girlfriend, a lawyer from Manchester, in the little house next to the temple. Janardan and his brother, Jai, 35, do their best to welcome mourners, but the dark shadows beneath their eyes and the endless cigarettes they light tell of their devastation. </p> <p>\"My parents feel like lightning has struck. We are all devastated. We have no idea at all what could have happened. He was such a warm, caring person. He honestly wouldn't hurt a fly. Even his tone of voice was soft. He had no aggression. </p> <p>\"That's what makes it so shocking. How could he have enemies? His popularity was so great among the community as a whole, not just the Hindus.\" </p> <p>In the past few days the Purohits have received calls from friends of Harish in Australia, east Africa, the United States and across Europe. Like his parents, these mourners cannot understand who would harm a man who had devoted his life to others. As well as being a priest, Mr Purohit worked with people with learning disabilities. </p> <p>His younger brother, Jai, said: \"He fought for equal opportunities - for people with learning disabilities and for widows, who are often left behind in the Asian community. He brought them forward, saying they have the same rights to live life to the full.\" </p> <p>Harish was born into a Brahmin family and was interested in the priesthood from childhood. His father, Karunashanker, is a priest who helped to found the Shree Shakti Mandir, one of the oldest temples in the city. </p> <p>Mr Purohit adopted a more modern style than other priests. At weddings his style was more chatty, and he would take time to explain the meaning of different parts of the ceremony to non-Hindus and Hindus with a shaky grasp of the purpose of the ceremonies of their religion. </p> <p>Keith Vaz, the MP for Leicester East, had known Mr Purohit for 15 years and had seen him last week at his constituency surgery where the priest had gone to talk about increasing the number of Hindus in the House of Lords. </p> <p>Mr Vaz said: \"He was very dynamic, not like your usual Hindu priest, with a big following, especially among young people. </p> <p>\"He was a different kind of priest, he was younger and less aloof. </p> <p>\"He had a particular following among the younger generation and his style was modern. I think he was a moderniser and tried to relate Hinduism to the needs of the community.\" </p> <p>The family, which moved to Leicester from Kenya in 1968, always believed that religious devotion should be allied to a social conscience. The Purohit parents encouraged their children to help the weak and struggling; all of them would end up working for social services. </p> <p>Even so, his brothers say that Harish took this sense of duty further than any of them. </p> <p>\"He fought for everyone who was weak and couldn't have their say,\" said Janardan. \"He used his power to help them achieve their rights. He was there for anyone who had problems, not just Hindus. He was the community in himself.\" </p> <p>Jai added: \"All we can do now is have stone hearts and pray for justice. We know his time has finished here. Probably God needs him somewhere else, to look after humans in other parts of the world.\"</p>",
