The actors emerge, circling the audience and shaking drums full of stones. It is a simple touch, but the storm is instantly raised. This is Shakespeare at its most direct and immediate, full of infectious fun. </p> <p>There are some wonderful touches: not just one actor but the entire cast play Ariel, their voices filling the air and echoing around the courtyard so that the island does indeed seem to become a magical place full of spirits. </p> <p>This production makes you feel like a kid again. As the play draws to its magical climax, we all lean forward upon our seats to drink in every magical moment like moths being drawn towards the light. </p> <p> Till Sunday.

      "bodyText": "The Tempest is the favoured Shakespeare play at Edinburgh this year - there are six productions on the fringe. But A and BC Theatre Company's outdoor production is certainly out of the ordinary. For a start, the audience is asked to sit in the middle, perched on small oil drums, while the drama takes place all around. The actors emerge, circling the audience and shaking drums full of stones. It is a simple touch, but the storm is instantly raised. This is Shakespeare at its most direct and immediate, full of infectious fun. There are some wonderful touches: not just one actor but the entire cast play Ariel, their voices filling the air and echoing around the courtyard so that the island does indeed seem to become a magical place full of spirits. This production makes you feel like a kid again. As the play draws to its magical climax, we all lean forward upon our seats to drink in every magical moment like moths being drawn towards the light. Till Sunday. Box office: 0131-530 3557.",

His first movement was unusually brisk and forceful, a long way from the veiled eroticism this piece conventionally possesses. Sometimes Zacharias's articulation can be fussy. But in the slow movement and the final Allegro, he found a totally idiomatic spontaneity, matching Mozart's invention with his own creative inspiration. </p>",

The thematic fecundity of the E flat major concerto K 449 was richly satisfying. But Zacharias's performance of the great A major concerto was the most fascinating of the concert. His first movement was unusually brisk and forceful, a long way from the veiled eroticism this piece conventionally possesses. Sometimes Zacharias's articulation can be fussy. But in the slow movement and the final Allegro, he found a totally idiomatic spontaneity, matching Mozart's invention with his own creative inspiration.",

The financial services authority has told the companies that they are not permitted to reprint the share tip information because they are not registered financial advisers - even though newspapers do not have to abide by the same rule themselves. Newspapers and magazines are exempt from the restriction as investment advice is not their primary purpose, an FSA spokeswoman said. The clampdown comes as the FSA is seeking to clarify its position on a range of internet-driven financial information sources including bulletin boards and chat rooms, which have at times been abused by rogue share promoters. The FSA is expected to outline its feelings in the autumn. Sharepages.com and Digitallook.com both said yesterday that they had suspended publishing round-ups of weekend newspaper tips at the request of the FSA. Several other leading financial news websites said that they had not been contacted by the FSA but would fight to keep their tips summaries as they were merely repeating information that was already in the public domain. \"It seems bizarre that we are forbidden from merely repeating information that is already widely circulated, especially since we are not altering, interpreting or commenting on it,\" said Sharepages' managing director, Marc Pinter-Krainer. \"We have suggested ways that the law could be modified but at present we haven't been able to reach a positive outcome,\" Mr Pinter-Krainer said. Digital Look said it would now only publish the name of the stocks tipped and provide a link to the relevant newspaper website. The FSA was at pains to emphasise that it was not \"anti-internet\", and said that it was working with the Treasury on ways to update legislation so that it took into account how the internet was changing the way in which people buy shares and find out information about companies. Rules governing the newspaper exemption were drawn up in 1986 - long before the internet became a mass phenomenon. \"It wouldn't matter if the tips were written on the back of an envelope or on the internet, the law prevents those not registered as financial advisers from making stock recommendations,\" the FSA spokeswoman said. \"This is all about protecting the consumer.

One song, he told us, was about \"waking up and finding that you've got a pony-tail on the back of your head\". </p> <p>Seven-minute sound-sketches are the band's thing, and One Thousand Miles captured the wind-in-your-hair exhilaration of driving nowhere in particular. Mick Turner's strong, clean-cut guitar riffs, and Ellis's feverish scraping were pinned together by Jim White's alternately soft-handed and hard-hitting percussion. </p> <p>Having assured us that Some Summers They Drop Like Flys (sic) from their latest album, Whatever You Love, You Are, was about badly-fitting tracksuit bottoms, Ellis teased out a folk tune somewhere between a serenade and a lament, which might well have charmed the worm from a bottle of tequila. It's this combination of touch and terror that distinguishes the band's sound, for the song reached a climax worthy of an exorcism, with Ellis falling to his knees, happily flagellating his fiddle. </p> <p>Dirty Three also do lounge-bar melancholy to remind you of the last time you were sucking ice-cubes for drops of JD. With Ellis once again genuflecting, and the stage dark apart from two green spotlights, the encore, Lullaby for Christie, offered doleful strains of violin, accompanied by little flurries of guitar and drums.

With a cast of drug dealers, music agents, a vampish European collector and disillusioned musicians, Downtown 81 is both innocent and poignant, given Basquiat's later death from a surfeit of drugs. \"I could see the handwriting on the wall,\" says Basquiat at one point. Eventually he meets his fairy godmother, Debbie Harry, who waves her wand and changes his life with a suitcase of cash. Downtown 81 captures that New York moment when punk, emerging rap, art school cool and the East Village art and music scenes were at their creative best. There are some great walk-on parts and terrific live music, including Basquiat's own band, Grey. At the Cameo, Edinburgh (0131-228 4141), tonight,Glasgow Film Theatre (0141-332 8128), on Thursday, and the Filmhouse, Edinburgh (0131-228 2688) on Saturday.",

      "body": "<p>I've spent the week interviewing Reynolds Price and investigating his literary papers. Price, born in 1933, was one of that golden generation of American novelists (Gore Vidal, William Styron and Truman Capote are others) who seemed to have been blessed in the cradle with genius, physical grace and - what writers need above all - good luck at the outset of their careers. </p> <p>A Rhodes scholar at Oxford in 1956, Price sent a batch of his unpublished stories to Stephen Spender (then the editor of the magazine Encounter) on the whimsical grounds that he thought the great poet had \"the kindest face I have ever seen\". </p> <p>Editorial kindness rarely extends to indulging the egos of hopeful undergraduates, even those with faces as beautiful as the young Price. But Spender read the manuscripts and realising, from page one, that he had discovered a great writer, rushed the stories into print. Like Byron, Reynolds Price awoke and found himself famous. Within 18 months, and at the age of 24, he was hailed as one of the major novelists of his time with A Long and Happy Life (a work which has never been out of print in America since 1962). </p> <p>Price's career thereafter went swimmingly. He returned to his native North Carolina to take up a position teaching creative writing at his alma mater, Duke University. He wrote novels, won prizes, made heaps of money and had, it seemed, a charmed life. Charm and a bubbling wit were what everyone noted about him. \"You make any house you are in golden,\" Spender once told him. </p> <p>In 1984, Price's world disintegrated. He was diagnosed with cancer - a one-foot-long, slimy growth \"as thick as a pencil\" had braided itself round his spinal cord. He called it \"the eel\". Price was, literally, at the cutting edge of oncology. Duke's medical school led the world in the surgical treatment of cancer. Its expert scalpel and radiotherapy killed the eel. That was the good news. The bad news was that the 4,000 rads (units of radiation) bombarded into Price's neck destroyed his nervous system. </p> <p>It was the cruellest of cures. At 51, Price found himself cancer-free but paraplegic. Other Americans might have enriched themselves with a vindictive malpractice suit. Reynolds confronted his condition not as an aggrieved patient, but as an author. Out of the experience of losing his lower body, he wrote a book with the ironic title A Whole New Life. </p> <p>Reading it is painful, humbling and intensely uplifting. As \"an American with disability\" (as the federal statute puts it), Price prefers the honest Anglo-Saxon terms \"gimp\" and \"cripple\". The most eloquent of writers, when occasion calls, he uses language with a thug's brutality. Talking of his sanitary arrangements he notes: \"Since the muscles that expel faeces from the lower intestines are inactive in most of the paralysed, some form of rubber-gloved manual removal is generally required. Whatever the individual gimp hits on for a workable method, he or she quickly becomes as familiar with his own piss and shit as any Paleolithic cave-dweller.\" </p> <p>If - as I have been doing over the last week - you converse with Price, you are aware of two things. He smiles and cracks jokes (hilariously funny jokes) continuously. And he writhes with pain continuously. His spine is destroyed, but still hurts excruciatingly: the eel's revenge. He refuses to use painkillers on the grounds that they dull his mind. </p> <p> S ince embarking on his whole new life, Price has, in most critics' judgment, written even better than he did in his old life. It's an extraordinary achievement. We ritually salute handicapped bravery - but often with a secret condescension. We know that those athletes in the Paralympics couldn't really compete with their unhandicapped colleagues. </p> <p>Last week some magnificently obstinate wheelchair-using American hikers battled their way to a peak in New Hampshire to force the Appalachian Mountain Club to do their legal duty and install a handicapped toilet, with grab bars, at 3,800 feet. But, in our hearts, we know that a mountaineer in a wheelchair is never going to be as good as someone with the use of his legs. </p> <p>With Price (and, I suspect, with Stephen Hawking) it is different. The human mind can conquer disability and soar above it. But don't take my word for it, get hold of one of the 20-odd books that Reynolds Price has written since 1984 and find out for yourself.</p>",

First Stam was granted a free header as he met a corner from David Beckham on the right with a brisk nod which saw Given arch back to touch the ball over the crossbar. Another corner, from Beckham on the left, found Stam distracting the Newcastle defence, leaving Johnsen to produce a header which Given this time could only help into the net. </p> <p>A rich vein of football from Ferguson's team followed. Ten minutes before half-time Giggs, half-stumbling as he gained possession on the left, began a multi-passing movement which ended with his shot striking the foot of the near post after Paul Scholes had laid the ball in from the right. </p> <p>While all this was happening Fabien Barthez, the goalkeeping Marshal of France signed by Ferguson in the hope that he will prove the real successor to Peter Schmeichel, was all but a spectator in his first home match as a Manchester United player. None of Newcastle's finishing seriously tested his capabilities and Barthez's most impressive contribution came from the length and accuracy of his clearances. \"He can,\" as Ferguson observed, \"play through-passes from the edge of his own box.\" </p> <p>A goal down at half-time, and with little prospect of drawing level, Robson replaced Alain Goma with Kieron Dyer clearly in the hope of giving Alan Shearer a modicum of support in his lone struggle against Stam and Johnsen.

Dean Kiely in the Charlton goal tipped a Paulo Wanchope header on to the post, but Charlton strolled to victory with Mark Kinsella coolly scoring the third with the outside of his right boot and Graham Stuart converting a penalty after Kinsella had been brought down by Weaver. \"We let ourselves down,\" said Prior, who could have a new central-defensive partner, Paul Ritchie, who completes his move from Rangers today, for Wednesday's home game against Sunderland. \"We are lucky we have still got 37 games to put it right.\" This was City's one consolation. They are back to square one this morning; Charlton are in the zone already.",

      "body": "<p>When these sides met in last year's Worthington Cup, rival fans chanted \"Boring, boring\" at each other. On Saturday they did not. That cup semi-final must have been bad. This was the cream of Midlands football. Already it tastes sour. </p> <p>The match was full of good prospects - Peter Taylor's first game in charge of Leicester, Stan Collymore's return against the last club to misunderstand him, the predictable fitness of Neil Lennon (and Gerry Taggart) after withdrawal from Northern Ireland's midweek game, debuts for Villa by David Ginola and the Turk Alpay Ozalan, who sounds like a cure for depression; he could be useful. </p> <p>Instead Robbie Savage seized the spotlight early, set the mood and soon they were all playing like savages. It was the law of the jungle with no clear path through and hacking the only way, desperate more than dirty. Only when the ball was with Paul Merson or Muzzy Izzet did there seem to be light. They consistently found space and team-mates but were often obliged to turn back for want of options from formations more 5-3-2 than 3-5-2. </p> <p>Closing down was top priority, so Ginola got little look-in, a testy booking and only an hour to play with. The attacks were less of a lessness. Dion Dublin should have hit the target with two late headers over. Collymore and Ade Akinbiyi are short of understanding. But Akinbiyi disconcerted with his pace, first leading to a cross that Collymore met unconvincingly, later going clear and blasting David James into action. </p> <p>James was last seen flapping the Cup to Chelsea at Wembley. Now he was clad in silver, which was fine for that save, embarrassingly eyecatching when he came for a cross that Collymore beat him to without the power to score. Collymore lacks match sharpness. </p> <p>Taylor felt Villa's tougher pre-season, going out of the Intertoto Cup, showed; so he was \"pleased with a point\".

      "bodyText": "When these sides met in last year's Worthington Cup, rival fans chanted \"Boring, boring\" at each other. On Saturday they did not. That cup semi-final must have been bad. This was the cream of Midlands football. Already it tastes sour. The match was full of good prospects - Peter Taylor's first game in charge of Leicester, Stan Collymore's return against the last club to misunderstand him, the predictable fitness of Neil Lennon (and Gerry Taggart) after withdrawal from Northern Ireland's midweek game, debuts for Villa by David Ginola and the Turk Alpay Ozalan, who sounds like a cure for depression; he could be useful. Instead Robbie Savage seized the spotlight early, set the mood and soon they were all playing like savages. It was the law of the jungle with no clear path through and hacking the only way, desperate more than dirty. Only when the ball was with Paul Merson or Muzzy Izzet did there seem to be light. They consistently found space and team-mates but were often obliged to turn back for want of options from formations more 5-3-2 than 3-5-2. Closing down was top priority, so Ginola got little look-in, a testy booking and only an hour to play with. The attacks were less of a lessness. Dion Dublin should have hit the target with two late headers over. Collymore and Ade Akinbiyi are short of understanding. But Akinbiyi disconcerted with his pace, first leading to a cross that Collymore met unconvincingly, later going clear and blasting David James into action. James was last seen flapping the Cup to Chelsea at Wembley. Now he was clad in silver, which was fine for that save, embarrassingly eyecatching when he came for a cross that Collymore beat him to without the power to score. Collymore lacks match sharpness. Taylor felt Villa's tougher pre-season, going out of the Intertoto Cup, showed; so he was \"pleased with a point\". He started last season, his first at Gillingham, with two defeats, then three draws, and ended it in promotion. But he needs Steve Guppy for skilled width. Villa, too, need enlightenment. John Gregory received a driving ban last week. Chastened could turn to beleaguered if they do not show better against Chelsea and Liverpool. Though Gareth Southgate showed no lack of commitment, too many players in a squad from one to 40 (Matthew Ghent) failed to escape in the summer.

      "body": "<p>Catchphrase, the long-running ITV gameshow, could hardly be described as cutting-edge television. A badly drawn cartoon of a horse that has seen better days appears with \"for sale\" written over its head. The answer to this conundrum? Flogging a dead horse - and so it goes on for 30 frankly excruciating minutes. </p> <p> The programme, produced by Carlton's Action Time, is, however, at the vanguard of TV's attempt to engage with new technology. Catchphrase is one of a growing number of gameshows to produce faithful online versions which are proving increasingly popular and allow fans to play each other at any time of the day. </p> <p> The marketing men call it brand extension and enthuse about the cross-promotion opportunities. In the US, Uproar.com, which features a series of games including Family Feud (known here as the less adversarial Family Fortunes) and 100%, is one of the top 30 sites and among the top 10 \"stickiest\". </p> <p> While other TV formats such as drama or sitcom are struggling to grapple with what opportunities the internet or interactivity might present, the humble gameshow looks as though it could have been invented with the web in mind. </p> <p> But online versions of existing games are only the beginning. As digital technology becomes more widespread, viewers will be able to play along with contestants while watching the programme on TV. </p> <p> The gameshow genre, which had already been given a dramatic shot in the arm by Who Wants to be a Millionaire?, looks set to have its place in the schedules cemented and it is not only the likes of Millionaire or the \"psycho\" formats inspired by Big Brother that stand to benefit. Interactivity and online versions could breathe new life into formats that have been on air for years.</p> <p> \"This is a very exciting time,\" says Stephen Leahy, joint managing director at Action Time and a veteran of gameshows dating back to the Krypton Factor. \"I've been in gameshows for 25 years and they've suddenly become this modern currency instead of being the forgotten bit in the schedule. Millionaire has obviously had an effect, but it is also because gameshows are ahead of what other types of TV formats can do with interactivity.\"</p> <p> Pearson, the UK-based media company was sufficiently convinced by the potential to take an 11% stake in Uproar in return for licensing some of its most popular gameshows to the site. Pearson owns the rights to a raft of formats including The Price is Right, the aforementioned Family Feud, 100% and Matchgame, screened in this country as Blankety Blank. </p> <p> The online versions already up and running are made to replicate the TV experience as closely as possible using the same graphics, rules and sound effects. Prizes on offer range from cash to Amazon vouchers, widescreen TVs and telescopes. </p> <p> Martin Trickey, entertainment producer at Uproar, describes the phenomenon as \"the yelling at the TV screen thing.

      "bodyText": "Catchphrase, the long-running ITV gameshow, could hardly be described as cutting-edge television. A badly drawn cartoon of a horse that has seen better days appears with \"for sale\" written over its head. The answer to this conundrum? Flogging a dead horse - and so it goes on for 30 frankly excruciating minutes. The programme, produced by Carlton's Action Time, is, however, at the vanguard of TV's attempt to engage with new technology. Catchphrase is one of a growing number of gameshows to produce faithful online versions which are proving increasingly popular and allow fans to play each other at any time of the day. The marketing men call it brand extension and enthuse about the cross-promotion opportunities. In the US, Uproar.com, which features a series of games including Family Feud (known here as the less adversarial Family Fortunes) and 100%, is one of the top 30 sites and among the top 10 \"stickiest\". While other TV formats such as drama or sitcom are struggling to grapple with what opportunities the internet or interactivity might present, the humble gameshow looks as though it could have been invented with the web in mind. But online versions of existing games are only the beginning. As digital technology becomes more widespread, viewers will be able to play along with contestants while watching the programme on TV. The gameshow genre, which had already been given a dramatic shot in the arm by Who Wants to be a Millionaire?, looks set to have its place in the schedules cemented and it is not only the likes of Millionaire or the \"psycho\" formats inspired by Big Brother that stand to benefit. Interactivity and online versions could breathe new life into formats that have been on air for years. \"This is a very exciting time,\" says Stephen Leahy, joint managing director at Action Time and a veteran of gameshows dating back to the Krypton Factor. \"I've been in gameshows for 25 years and they've suddenly become this modern currency instead of being the forgotten bit in the schedule. Millionaire has obviously had an effect, but it is also because gameshows are ahead of what other types of TV formats can do with interactivity.\" Pearson, the UK-based media company was sufficiently convinced by the potential to take an 11% stake in Uproar in return for licensing some of its most popular gameshows to the site. Pearson owns the rights to a raft of formats including The Price is Right, the aforementioned Family Feud, 100% and Matchgame, screened in this country as Blankety Blank. The online versions already up and running are made to replicate the TV experience as closely as possible using the same graphics, rules and sound effects. Prizes on offer range from cash to Amazon vouchers, widescreen TVs and telescopes. Martin Trickey, entertainment producer at Uproar, describes the phenomenon as \"the yelling at the TV screen thing. You want simple games that people are familiar with and ones that people get involved in\". Pearson hopes to launch an online version of The Price is Right towards the end of the year but, alive to the opportunity, is for the first time developing the game in-house as well as bringing the Uproar games to the UK site. A typical 15-minute game will be broken by a commercial break which Catherine Mackay, president of Pearson TV Enterprises, optimistically says helps to complete the experience that you are playing in the gameshow on TV: \"You are getting 3,000 people playing Family Feud online at any one time which says that gameshows work in that medium.

      "trailText": "Single-sex teaching for some subjects will be introduced into mixed state schools if evidence shows it can improve boys' performance, the education secretary, David Blunkett, said yesterday.",
      "byline": "Will Woodward, education editor",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Single-sex teaching for some subjects will be introduced into mixed state schools if evidence shows it can improve boys' performance, the education secretary, David Blunkett, said yesterday.</p> <p>Mr Blunkett blamed the growing academic gender divide on a \"laddish anti-learning culture\", and said deep-seated cultural issues needed to be confronted.</p> <p>The education secretary said he would give schools \"ammunition\" to tackle the poor performance of boys, amid a wave of concern about the gender gap in education, which is set to be heightened by GCSE results this week.</p> <p>On Thursday girls are expected to extend their already substantial lead at GCSE, a week after results showed them achieving more A grades than boys at A-level for the first time.</p> <p>The shadow education secretary, Theresa May, accused Mr Blunkett of interfering in schools with the initiative and \"clutching at straws\".</p> <p>Since 1998, local education authorities have been expected to include proposals to improve boys' results in their education development plans. Mr Blunkett now wants to examine their success and intends to enlist the help of Chris Woodhead, the head of Ofsted, the office for standards in education, when he returns from holiday next week.</p> <p>\"It is now time to see how well these are working and I will be speaking to Ofsted about the role it might play in helping gather the evidence, including pilot programmes already running, in respect of single-sex teaching of some subjects in coeducational schools,\" Mr Blunkett said.</p> <p>\"We will pin down what works well and ensure schools and education authorities have ammunition to turn around boys' academic performance.\"</p> <p>A \"gender and achievement\" website is being launched by the Department for Education and Employment for the start of the new school year, to give advice and enable schools to share best practice. There will be a series of regional conferences on the issue with education experts.</p> <p>Officials stressed that there was no question of turning schools from coeducational schools into single-sex establishments. Nor are they planning to introduce more pilot schemes. Some educationalists doubt that imposing single-sex teaching can make in itself a significant difference.</p> <p>The education secretary said it should not be forgotten that boys as well as girls were achieving better results. \"However, we face a genuine problem of underachievement among boys, particularly those from working class families.</p> <p>\"This underachievement is linked to a laddish culture which in many areas has grown out of deprivation and a lack of self-confidence and opportunity,\" Mr Blunkett said.</p> <p>\"The gap that has opened up between the sexes at school is a long-standing and international problem for which there is no quick fix, but I am determined that our boys should not miss out.</p> <p>\"Together, schools, parents and the government need to play their part to instil a cultural commitment to learning among boys. That way we can begin to reverse the gap in achievement between boys and girls that has been such a feature of the last decade.\"</p> <p>This is not a new preoccupation for Mr Blunkett. His 1998 guidance was introduced as the then schools minister, Stephen Byers, warned: \"We must challenge the laddish anti-learning culture which has developed and we simply can not accept, with a shrug of our shoulders that 'boys will be boys'.\"</p> <p>Mr Woodhead's concern pre-dates that. In March 1996 he caused controversy by warning: \"The failure of boys, and in particular white working-class boys, is one of the most disturbing problems we face within the whole of the education system.\"</p> <p>Since GCSEs were introduced, girls have done better than boys and the gap continues to widen. In 1989 35.8% of girls and 29.8% of boys obtained five or more A-Cs at GCSE; in 1999 53.2% of girls and 42.6% of boys achieved the same results.

      "bodyText": "Single-sex teaching for some subjects will be introduced into mixed state schools if evidence shows it can improve boys' performance, the education secretary, David Blunkett, said yesterday. Mr Blunkett blamed the growing academic gender divide on a \"laddish anti-learning culture\", and said deep-seated cultural issues needed to be confronted. The education secretary said he would give schools \"ammunition\" to tackle the poor performance of boys, amid a wave of concern about the gender gap in education, which is set to be heightened by GCSE results this week. On Thursday girls are expected to extend their already substantial lead at GCSE, a week after results showed them achieving more A grades than boys at A-level for the first time. The shadow education secretary, Theresa May, accused Mr Blunkett of interfering in schools with the initiative and \"clutching at straws\". Since 1998, local education authorities have been expected to include proposals to improve boys' results in their education development plans. Mr Blunkett now wants to examine their success and intends to enlist the help of Chris Woodhead, the head of Ofsted, the office for standards in education, when he returns from holiday next week. \"It is now time to see how well these are working and I will be speaking to Ofsted about the role it might play in helping gather the evidence, including pilot programmes already running, in respect of single-sex teaching of some subjects in coeducational schools,\" Mr Blunkett said. \"We will pin down what works well and ensure schools and education authorities have ammunition to turn around boys' academic performance.\" A \"gender and achievement\" website is being launched by the Department for Education and Employment for the start of the new school year, to give advice and enable schools to share best practice. There will be a series of regional conferences on the issue with education experts. Officials stressed that there was no question of turning schools from coeducational schools into single-sex establishments. Nor are they planning to introduce more pilot schemes. Some educationalists doubt that imposing single-sex teaching can make in itself a significant difference. The education secretary said it should not be forgotten that boys as well as girls were achieving better results. \"However, we face a genuine problem of underachievement among boys, particularly those from working class families. \"This underachievement is linked to a laddish culture which in many areas has grown out of deprivation and a lack of self-confidence and opportunity,\" Mr Blunkett said. \"The gap that has opened up between the sexes at school is a long-standing and international problem for which there is no quick fix, but I am determined that our boys should not miss out. \"Together, schools, parents and the government need to play their part to instil a cultural commitment to learning among boys. That way we can begin to reverse the gap in achievement between boys and girls that has been such a feature of the last decade.\" This is not a new preoccupation for Mr Blunkett. His 1998 guidance was introduced as the then schools minister, Stephen Byers, warned: \"We must challenge the laddish anti-learning culture which has developed and we simply can not accept, with a shrug of our shoulders that 'boys will be boys'.\" Mr Woodhead's concern pre-dates that. In March 1996 he caused controversy by warning: \"The failure of boys, and in particular white working-class boys, is one of the most disturbing problems we face within the whole of the education system.\" Since GCSEs were introduced, girls have done better than boys and the gap continues to widen. In 1989 35.8% of girls and 29.8% of boys obtained five or more A-Cs at GCSE; in 1999 53.2% of girls and 42.6% of boys achieved the same results. In English, the divide is even more startling; 61% of girls achieved an A-C last year, compared with 45% of boys. At degree level, male students narrowly achieve more firsts. Mr Blunkett said the government was \"already having some success in narrowing the gender gap in the early years\". Government literacy and numeracy strategies were helping to prevent boys falling behind girls. In key stage 2 tests last year, 11-year-old boys closed the gap by five percentage points to 11% in English, and matched girls in maths. He claimed other measures addressed the issue, including learning mentors for disaffected pupils, \u00a3140m to help excluded pupils, integrated careers advice and youth services, and the development of vocational GCSEs and A-levels. Mr Blunkett said boys needed \"better male role models\" inside and outside school. He pointed to primary and nursery schools, where 83% of teachers are women, although he claimed inquiries from men about postgraduate teaching courses were up 50% since the government announced its \u00a36,000 training bursaries. Primary school reading lists had been changed to make books more stimulating for boys, professional footballers were being enlisted to help promote after-school study centres, and Harry Enfield's teenage character Kevin was encouraging people to stay in education and training after GCSE as part of the government's \"Don't quit now\" campaign. But Ms May dismissed the initiative: \"This is yet another example of this government interfering in schools and telling teachers what to do. David Blunkett is clutching at straws.\" David Hart, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the government lacked a coherent strategy for addressing laddish behaviour which led to poor results. \"Unless we grab the boys early at primary school age and in the first three years of secondary school at the very latest to persuade them that anti-academic attitudes are simply leading them down a potentially disastrous path - and also get the parents on side - I think all this talk about segregating the sexes will have no effect.\"",

      "bodyText": "The crisis surrounding Scottish examinations deepened yesterday as headteachers called for schools to have the power to check every result amid allegations that some students' exam papers had gone missing. A grim picture of chaos at the Scottish Qualifications Authority was becoming apparent as 3,000 of the students who have been barred from the university clearing process because of erroneous results learned they would have to wait even longer to get their grades. The authority confirmed yesterday that 2,000 of the 5,000 students known to have inaccurate or incomplete results would have their grades confirmed this morning, but that the remaining students would have to wait longer for their results. Pressure is growing on the Scottish education minister, Sam Galbraith, to resign. The minister, a close friend of Donald Dewar, is adamant that he will not pay for the outside agency's failings, but he may be unable to ride out the storm. Much of the crisis stems from what Mr Galbraith and the SQA euphemistically describe as \"missing data\". But it has emerged that the problems may have been compounded by the SQA's handling of teachers recruited as examination markers. These markers were not recruited until two months after the normal date, and the amount of teaching experience they were required to have was lowered from three years to two. It has been alleged that this, and a huge backlog of papers to be marked, led to chaos in the quality control system, with the normal system of checks and balances bypassed or badly compromised. Donald Matheson, president of the Headteachers' Association of Scotland, said he had grave concerns about the accuracy of some of the marking as anomalous results were double or treble what would normally be expected. \"We are calling for schools to be given the right to check papers,\" he said. Remarking and checking on a grand scale would add greatly to the cost and political impact of the crisis, but it might be the only way out. Already the SQA is bracing itself for a large number of appeals against grades, and the Scottish parliament's executive yesterday pledged to make additional resources available to cover the costs. At one school in Edinburgh, teachers alleged that the higher grade papers of 10 business studies students had been lost by the SQA. Frank Gestenberg, headteacher of George Watson's college, said the alarm was raised after pupils were given fail grades when they and the school expected a pass. \"The SQA has now told us the papers have been lost,\" he said.

Violence erupted between the two sides in the neighbouring Shankill Road area on Saturday when seven men were injured after UDA gunmen twice sprayed a bar during and after a big loyalist paramilitary rally which they claimed was attacked by the UVF. Homes belonging to members and supporters of the Progressive Party were later attacked. Earlier today John White of the Ulster Democratic Party called for the appointment of a go-between to try to negotiate an end to the feud, but today's shooting is likely to quash hopes of an immediate truce.",

Mr Shayler, 34, who was arrested at Dover port immediately on arrival in Britain this morning, was taken to Charing Cross police station for questioning following three years of \"political exile\" in France. Appearing after his release with his lawyer John Wadham, Mr Shayler said: \"I decided to return to Britain to face charges under the Official Secrets Act. \"I have done this to clear my name and to allow a jury of 12 of my fellow citizens to judge me.

Mr Shayler said: \"The authorities want to restrict the charges to what was revealed in the Mail on Sunday in August 1997, but I wonder whether this is an attempt to prevent the jury from hearing the whole story.\" European human rights legislation, to be introduced in Britain this autumn, may provide a defence to \"whistle-blowers\" prosecuted under the Official Secrets Act. Mr Wadham said: \"The Official Secrets Act will have to read in a way that gives more respect to freedom of expression and the public interest in disclosure. \"David Shayler's case will test the extent to which this theory works in practice.\" Mr Shayler fled to France in 1997 after claiming in the Mail on Sunday that two MI6 officers were behind a failed attempt to assassinate the Libyan leader.",

      "body": "<p>If you were starting a magazine company intent on gargantuan sales then, judging by the latest batch of half-yearly ABC figures, you wouldn't go for the glamorous part of the sector - the monthly women's and men's glossies. Both are now \"mature\" markets, like old-style women's weeklies. Which means that, with the odd exception (usually due to relaunches, free cover-mount giveaways, intensive promotion, rising editors replacing duff ones, etc), they face remorseless, drip-drip sales erosion. Each February and August brings bad news. </p> <p>Nor would you go for computer mags, despite the evidence of the average newsstand: titles tend to be linked to particular games-makers or PC companies, fragmenting the market. Portfolios of PC and internet titles have helped to boost newer publishers such as Future and Dennis, but their individual circulations are usually low. </p> <p>No, you'd choose unisex sectors - where circulations are not halved by the glossies' gender split - which involve the nation's favourite waking-hours activities: shopping, telly and driving. </p> <p>The top five supermarket mags have a combined circulation of 3,832,990 (even though Tesco, the biggest chain, doesn't bother publishing one); chuck in the Boots and Superdrug titles, and you add another 2,976,917. The top 10 TV titles rack up 11,336,061 copies between them. AA Magazine alone goes to 4,374,601 motorists. Bear in mind that, in these sectors, many of these magazines are not what ABC calls \"actively purchased\" (Sky Customer Magazine, for instance, goes to all subscribers). But the figures are still spectacular. </p> <p>Of these sectors, the TV listings market - volatile, and pitching traditional publishers against contract companies, long-established paid-for mags against free titles - is easily the most fascinating. The Jan-June 2000 figures show sales of the old stalwarts, Radio Times (1,250,134, down 10% year on year) and TV Times (705,347, down 14.6%), continuing to droop among the paid-for group, while IPC's What's On TV (1,707,815) was down 5.8% year on year but still way ahead of the Bauer challengers, TV Quick (578,796) and TV Choice (784,904) - the latter an autumn 1999 launch posting its first ABC. The sector's really big hitters, though, are the free titles for pay-TV viewers, Cable Guide (1,820,092) and the two Sky mags. Here the big change is a massive migration from analogue Skyview (1,427,789) to digital Sky Customer (ex-Skyview Digital; 2,644,874), giving the latter an astronomical but deceptive year on year rise of 479.1%. </p> <p>Each six-monthly set of results also provides an opportunity to see how starkly specific commercial reality matches up to the buoyant mission statements made by high-profile, usually first-time editors in the easygoing interviews that accompanied their arrival. Tory candidate and Have I Got News For You buffoon Boris Johnson, for example, replaced Frank Johnson in the editor's seat at the Spectator almost exactly a year ago - so this is the first full sales period for the weekly since he put his stamp on it. Its performance is strong but not dazzling, with sales of 59,747 continuing an upward movement (up 3.8% year on year, 2.2% period on period) which nevertheless appears to be slowing. With a new editor expected to be installed shortly, the Spec is a long way ahead of the New Statesman (21,876) and Prospect (16,761), but still under half the circulation of the Economist's UK edition (127,887). </p> <p>Geordie Greig, hired with much fanfare last year to replace Jane Procter at Tatler, has created a buzz about the title - Jerry Hall and Nicola Formby were made contributing editors, several interviews have been followed up by the national press, and (as with Alexandra Shulman at Vogue) links have been forged with the Telegraph titles. </p> <p>So far, however, the bottom-line result is stasis: in August 1999, Procter's last full ABC was 85,873; a year later, Greig's first full ABC is 85,428 (up 0.29% period on period). But Cond\u00e9 Nast is bullish about the 11.49% jump in newsstand sales - almost certainly the result of the sharper news sense that the ex-Sunday Times books editor has sought to achieve. </p> <p>At Marie Claire, Liz Jones - high-profile thanks to her remarkably candid, currently mistitled Single File confessional column in the Sunday Times's Style section - produced her first issue last July, so this is her second ABC judgment day. With a latest figure of 420,146 (down 4% year on year, 6.7% period on period), she has still to halt the fall in the monthly's sales since the days of founding editor Glenda Bailey. Marie Claire's results are roughly in line with the general trend in a sector where other former star performers such as Bella, Company, Prima and Red are also losing readers; Elle (219,377) and Woman's Journal (124,163, up 20.3% year on year, though down on the previous period) were among the few to post gains. </p> <p>Looking at magland's long-running head-to-heads, the biggest news is that Hello! (458,663) has just managed to snatch back the lead in the weekly celebrity title market from OK! (455,162), after being humiliatingly overhauled in the second half of last year by a challenger making huge percentage gains every six months. Hello!'s own sales have actually declined, but its rival's figure of 551,901 in July-Dec 1999 was inflated by demand for issues covering the wedding of Posh and Becks and proved unsustainable. </p> <p>As for the battle between GQ's Dylan Jones - by now notorious for removing bits of young women's clothing without their consent (digitally, on his covers, as with the men's mag's classy \"Kylie's bum\" front) - and Esquire's Peter Howarth, who has made much of taking a stance against laddism by cutting back on bared babes, victory has gone to the former: Cond\u00e9 Nast's GQ (138,177) shed sales but nevertheless lengthened its lead because the NatMags title (70,435) suffered a horrendous 30% slump, both year on year and period on period. </p> <p>Group publisher Lizzie Kershaw's defence, nostalgically familiar to aficionados of BBC spin on tumbling audience figures in the John Birt years (as in the \"sliding down the Bannister\" era at Radio 1) was that \"we knew when we refocused Esquire that an initial fall in circulation was likely but now we have a fantastic product and are building a loyal set of intelligent, sharper readers\". </p> <p>In the bitter feud between the posh monthlies, Tatler - already ahead in UK newsstand sales, Cond\u00e9 Nast contends - looks poised to overtake its NatMags counterpart Harpers &amp; Queen in the next period. Although Tatler remained virtually static with Greig at the helm, the 5.3% year-on-year drop at Fiona Mcpherson's Harpers &amp; Queen (87,123) narrowed the latter's lead to under 2,000 copies. </p> <p>In the declining women's monthly market, the rivalry between NatMags' Cosmo, the long standing market leader, and IPC's Marie Claire was sharpened when the June-Dec 1999 figures came out in February by the latter's claim that it was now on top (\"ridiculous\" said NatMags supremo Terry Mansfield). The relative newcomer was 14,841 ahead in news-stand sales, although subscriptions allowed Cosmo to stay on top. </p> <p>Supremacy in Jan-June 2000 was always going to be decided by which title lost fewer readers. Cosmo, in the last full period of Mandi Norwood's editorship - Lorraine Butler is already installed, but the first issue commissioned by her is due in October - held on comfortably with 450,057 (down 4.3% year on year), nearly 30,000 ahead of Marie Claire. Duncan Edwards, NatMags' deputy MD and Mansfield's heir apparent, was even able to crow that it had \"overtaken Marie Claire on the newsstand\". </p> <p>There's a twist in the tail, however. Candis, an upstart, Cheshire-based subscription title no bigger than the average paperback novel, posted only a modest 1.4% year-on-year hike and not a single copy was \"actively purchased\" at a newsstand. But, combined with Cosmo's slide, its rise to 456,169 took it to the top of the monthly sector. Cosmo is no longer No 1. Or only No 1 with an annoying little proviso. </p> <p>Additional research by Jemima Sissons</p>",

Marie Claire's results are roughly in line with the general trend in a sector where other former star performers such as Bella, Company, Prima and Red are also losing readers; Elle (219,377) and Woman's Journal (124,163, up 20.3% year on year, though down on the previous period) were among the few to post gains. Looking at magland's long-running head-to-heads, the biggest news is that Hello! (458,663) has just managed to snatch back the lead in the weekly celebrity title market from OK! (455,162), after being humiliatingly overhauled in the second half of last year by a challenger making huge percentage gains every six months. Hello!'s own sales have actually declined, but its rival's figure of 551,901 in July-Dec 1999 was inflated by demand for issues covering the wedding of Posh and Becks and proved unsustainable. As for the battle between GQ's Dylan Jones - by now notorious for removing bits of young women's clothing without their consent (digitally, on his covers, as with the men's mag's classy \"Kylie's bum\" front) - and Esquire's Peter Howarth, who has made much of taking a stance against laddism by cutting back on bared babes, victory has gone to the former: Cond\u00e9 Nast's GQ (138,177) shed sales but nevertheless lengthened its lead because the NatMags title (70,435) suffered a horrendous 30% slump, both year on year and period on period. Group publisher Lizzie Kershaw's defence, nostalgically familiar to aficionados of BBC spin on tumbling audience figures in the John Birt years (as in the \"sliding down the Bannister\" era at Radio 1) was that \"we knew when we refocused Esquire that an initial fall in circulation was likely but now we have a fantastic product and are building a loyal set of intelligent, sharper readers\". In the bitter feud between the posh monthlies, Tatler - already ahead in UK newsstand sales, Cond\u00e9 Nast contends - looks poised to overtake its NatMags counterpart Harpers &amp; Queen in the next period. Although Tatler remained virtually static with Greig at the helm, the 5.3% year-on-year drop at Fiona Mcpherson's Harpers &amp; Queen (87,123) narrowed the latter's lead to under 2,000 copies. In the declining women's monthly market, the rivalry between NatMags' Cosmo, the long standing market leader, and IPC's Marie Claire was sharpened when the June-Dec 1999 figures came out in February by the latter's claim that it was now on top (\"ridiculous\" said NatMags supremo Terry Mansfield). The relative newcomer was 14,841 ahead in news-stand sales, although subscriptions allowed Cosmo to stay on top. Supremacy in Jan-June 2000 was always going to be decided by which title lost fewer readers. Cosmo, in the last full period of Mandi Norwood's editorship - Lorraine Butler is already installed, but the first issue commissioned by her is due in October - held on comfortably with 450,057 (down 4.3% year on year), nearly 30,000 ahead of Marie Claire. Duncan Edwards, NatMags' deputy MD and Mansfield's heir apparent, was even able to crow that it had \"overtaken Marie Claire on the newsstand\". There's a twist in the tail, however. Candis, an upstart, Cheshire-based subscription title no bigger than the average paperback novel, posted only a modest 1.4% year-on-year hike and not a single copy was \"actively purchased\" at a newsstand. But, combined with Cosmo's slide, its rise to 456,169 took it to the top of the monthly sector. Cosmo is no longer No 1. Or only No 1 with an annoying little proviso.

Our first response was, predictably, to get very excited. If they were serious, it would mean a multi-million-pound advertising spend. The company in question is a household name and we would be working with real professionals. </p> <p>They refused to tell us any more about the project until we had signed a confidentiality contract. This meant we would be forbidden to talk about the product and their plans without their permission for all eternity. If we broke this agreement, we would have their lawyers to deal with. So we signed. If this was supposed to give us the impression that they were serious heavyweights, well, they succeeded. One of our team was dispatched to take the brief, face to face, along with three other wannabe PR agency hopefuls. </p> <p>When the details of the project arrived back at our office it was something of an anti-climax. The product was a peculiar variation on packaged food for busy people. It was frozen, but it was also fresh. And it was packaged in groovy silver foil to attract gullible 18-34-year-olds. </p> <p>We held a meeting and mulled it over. Someone suggested that we drop it and not bother getting involved. Our team of 14 consultants was busy enough on PR campaigns for Absolut Vodka, The Big Breakfast, Top of the Pops Magazine, American Airlines and S Club 7, without having to go chasing after new business. </p> <p>But I held firm. I was thinking greedily about how the brand name would look on our client list. I told the team that this pitch would challenge us, and that if nothing else, we would certainly learn from it. </p> <p>And so we had 10 days to prepare. Our first move was to pull in a freelance PR director - she cost \u00a3500 a day - and negotiate a chunk of her time to help come up with a strategy to win the business. </p> <p>Next we conducted an audit, talking to groups of consumers to put a sense of perspective around the product. Would people actually buy the stuff? How challenging was it? Where in the supermarket would it be sold? </p> <p>Another job was to create \"mood boards\". This entailed going through piles of magazines and newspapers to compile a picture of the target consumers' habits, how they shopped for food and how generally they lived their lives. By this stage we had analysed the brief to the point of knowing it off by heart. We had started to get an understanding of what might be needed to generate front-page news for the product. </p> <p>But still we needed more information. The brief was vague on some points and even contradicted itself. So we asked if we could talk to the advertising agency. They had been busy at work on the project for over six months. Unfortunately we were told, \"No.\" </p> <p>This was strange. Quite often, the advertising is more interesting and newsworthy than the product itself. Without the benefit of knowing what the advertising would be, we felt like we were shooting in the dark. </p> <p>Still, we ploughed on, and with four days to go we held another meeting to review our work. We decided to go for broke with an idea that had the potential to put the brand into every tabloid newspaper in the country. </p> <p>By the day of the pitch, our document was 52 pages long. We had created a series of elaborate tables and presentation boards. In a little under two weeks, we had completed a crash course in frozen-food marketing and PR. </p> <p>My wife had even started to contribute, waking me up in the middle of the night to tell me that she'd had an idea. The four of us loaded up the car and drove off down the motorway to the corporate HQ where the meeting was due to take place. </p> <p>Unfortunately the pitch did not live up to our expectations. It was a miserable affair. The product manager - a serious-looking woman in her late 20s - sat next to two corporate PR executives. Both of them were distracted because of a crisis elsewhere in the office. Apparently cod had just become an endangered species. Next to them was a smiling man from the advertising agency who was doodling on his pad. </p> <p>Our presentation took an hour and a half. We sold our ideas as if our lives depended upon it. No questions were asked. Our attempts at witty remarks were greeted by vacant expressions. </p> <p>At one point, desperate for some form of feedback, we asked them a question. It became apparent from the reply that they had not understood a word we had been saying. We were too embarrassed to make anything of it. </p> <p>As we crawled through the last set of ideas it suddenly occurred to me that we should stop the presentation, down tools, and walk out there and then. This sort of confrontation in a pitch scenario is always the kiss of death because most people - especially uncertain clients - hate being put on the spot. It means that they might have to think spontaneously and without being able to spend a month analysing all the issues. But I decided against it. We continued meekly laying our work out on the table in the hope of getting some sort of response. As we stood up to leave the product manager said to me, \"Thank you, John.\" She'd even forgotten my name. I asked them for business cards. They had none. </p> <p>We drove back to London with heavy hearts. It was obvious that the pitch had not gone well. The clients had had nothing to say about our ideas.

Plastering advertisements on vehicles is nothing new. But the latest trend in the US goes one step further. </p> <p>Two new companies in California are paying the public to have their cars wrapped in advertisements and brand logos, and drivers are signing up in their thousands. The cars are fully covered in a high-quality vinyl adhesive, guaranteed not to damage paintwork when it is removed. The ad can be for anything from Head &amp; Shoulders to Andersen Consulting, and the gaudier and more traffic-stopping the better. And in return for becoming mobile billboards, drivers are paid up to $400 a month for as long as a campaign runs. One of these companies, FreeCar Media, is even giving people brand-new cars to drive around for two years. All the driver pays for is petrol and insurance. </p> <p>The firms act as middlemen, matching drivers with suitable brands. Young executives, for example, may be good for promoting an investment firm. Fitness enthusiasts who frequent gyms and the outdoors could help sell bottled water. Families could promote a new theme park. It's not only novel, they say, it's high exposure; the average American spends two hours a day in his car and drives over 40 miles. And for the drivers, it's payback time - an opportunity to make money out of the very companies that have bled consumers for years. </p> <p>\"The US advertising industry is worth $215bn and we're putting a portion of that back into consumers' pockets,\" says Daniel Shifrin, president and founder of Autowraps.com which, since its January launch, has signed up 50,000 drivers in 15 states, and 40 advertisers. These include Procter &amp; Gamble, Kraft Foods, Coca-Cola and several dot.com start-ups. Shifrin, whose idea came to him in a traffic jam, has wrapped around 350 cars so far, and says his San Francisco company is growing \"like a virus\". </p> <p>Lawrence Butler, chairman and co-founder of rival firm FreeCar Media in Los Angeles, says he was inspired by the wrapped buses he saw in LA and New York. \"I thought, why not on private vehicles? If you're on the freeway or the car's parked across the street, you can't just ignore it.\" And he claims clients get not just mobile ads, but mobile salespeople. \"People are so inquisitive about the cars they're rolling their windows down and asking drivers to talk about it, so the driver becomes an ambassador for the product.\" </p> <p>There's no chance of drivers pocketing the cash and hiding the car in their garage. Vehicles are inspected monthly for mileage and condition (Autowraps.com insists they're washed at least once a month) and FreeCar Media installs electronic mapping devices that allow advertisers to keep track of where their drivers are going. </p> <p>Both firms plan to expand internationally; FreeCar Media, with 100,000 drivers and four advertisers, already has drivers signed up in London. And both want to use their cars for non-profit causes. Butler and his team paid for cars to be driven around during last week's Democratic national convention in LA urging people to vote (although they were wrapped, in rather partisan style, in large photos of Al Gore). Shifrin is talking to anti-drink-driving groups and says he wants to persuade anti-smoking organisations to pay teenagers to drive cars emblazoned with logos such as \"Smoking sucks\". </p> <p>Dominique Hanssens, Bud Knapp Professor of Marketing at UCLA, sees car wrapping taking off: \"There's a good deal of burnout and saturation with traditional media. Most people simply zap through commercials on TV, so traditional advertising is not getting the reach advertisers pay for.\" The problem, says Hanssens, is overkill. \"If it becomes every third or fourth car that's wrapped, people will zap through that mentally too. But it's unusual, and I'm not surprised it originated here. It sounds crazy enough.\" </p> <p>The folks at American Esquire magazine thought the same thing when they were looking for an April Fool's article for their spring issue. Unaware of the existence of the two firms, contributing editor Ted Fishman dreamed up a bogus internet start-up called FreeWheelz that gave away free cars and financed them by wrapping the vehicles in ads. He even went so far as to set up a fictitious company website to back up his article. </p> <p>But no one got the joke, and soon Esquire was fielding calls and emails from willing drivers and intrigued reporters alike. \"Ted thought, what's the most absurd business plan I can think of? But it just wasn't over-the-top enough,\" concedes Peter Griffin, Esquire's deputy editor. </p> <p>\"It's a reflection on our society that by the time he came up with the idea, pitched it to his editors, and had the thing printed, there were companies already doing it,\" says Butler, who admits to a feeling of panic when he first saw the article. FreeCar Media was just about to launch, and when Butler got in touch, the lads at Esquire saw a business opportunity. \"They said, if that many people are signing up there's something in it,\" says Butler. So they sold him the names they had gathered, plus rights to the FreeWheelz website. Butler learned that there may be such a thing as a free car, but not a free car website. The cost to him? A cool $25,000.</p>",

Shifrin is talking to anti-drink-driving groups and says he wants to persuade anti-smoking organisations to pay teenagers to drive cars emblazoned with logos such as \"Smoking sucks\". Dominique Hanssens, Bud Knapp Professor of Marketing at UCLA, sees car wrapping taking off: \"There's a good deal of burnout and saturation with traditional media. Most people simply zap through commercials on TV, so traditional advertising is not getting the reach advertisers pay for.\" The problem, says Hanssens, is overkill. \"If it becomes every third or fourth car that's wrapped, people will zap through that mentally too. But it's unusual, and I'm not surprised it originated here. It sounds crazy enough.\" The folks at American Esquire magazine thought the same thing when they were looking for an April Fool's article for their spring issue. Unaware of the existence of the two firms, contributing editor Ted Fishman dreamed up a bogus internet start-up called FreeWheelz that gave away free cars and financed them by wrapping the vehicles in ads. He even went so far as to set up a fictitious company website to back up his article. But no one got the joke, and soon Esquire was fielding calls and emails from willing drivers and intrigued reporters alike. \"Ted thought, what's the most absurd business plan I can think of? But it just wasn't over-the-top enough,\" concedes Peter Griffin, Esquire's deputy editor. \"It's a reflection on our society that by the time he came up with the idea, pitched it to his editors, and had the thing printed, there were companies already doing it,\" says Butler, who admits to a feeling of panic when he first saw the article. FreeCar Media was just about to launch, and when Butler got in touch, the lads at Esquire saw a business opportunity. \"They said, if that many people are signing up there's something in it,\" says Butler. So they sold him the names they had gathered, plus rights to the FreeWheelz website. Butler learned that there may be such a thing as a free car, but not a free car website. The cost to him? A cool $25,000.",

Or so it seemed. </p> <p>With the spectacle of the various weird wannabes currently taking up space on our schedules and terminals from the Big Brother house, much of the speculation about Smart Hearts already seems oddly anachronistic; as the country becomes embroiled in the gameshow's bitching premise, the round-the-clock eavesdropping extravaganza doesn't seem that off the wall. </p> <p>On paper even the subjects of Smart Hearts don't sound too different from those of much of C4's increasingly homogenous output - obnoxious, vain, frequently drunk and verbally aggressive. However, unlike the away-from-it-all population of the various Uncovered series they are engaged enough to challenge both our perceptions and their involvement. And if that involvement at times takes solipsism to breathtaking heights, at least they aren't in it for a cash pay-out or a career in the media. </p> <p>But while the experiences of Brendan, his soon-to-be ex-wife Claire and new girlfriend Lisa's excruciatingly self-conscious parody of their lives are rather enjoyable and their mordantly thorough introspection is grotesquely compelling, it soon becomes apparent that the basic premise of the series - the experiment in convergence - hadn't come off. </p> <p>Very little of Smart Hearts on television is informed by the web side of the project, leaving us with what is basically another narrative docu-soap, crudely glueing together the sensational moments from a lengthy filming period. And, it must be said, a lingering impression that all we have learned about this unholy trinity is not necessarily what it appears. \"Everyone was hamming it up. Most definitely,\" says Lisa. \"I've come to realise there is no such thing as documentary - I'm acting, so whatever you're getting, it isn't real life. And if that's Brendan, I'm not living with him.\" The gap between the depiction and the reality she found hilarious: \"I was very taken aback by the press response to the pilot - that nobody thought it was funny. They should have been scratching their heads and asking if they had been hoodwinked.\" </p> <p>When I ask the director of Smart Hearts, Victoria Mapplebeck, if the joke is really on us, she looks concerned: \"I get worried when you use terms like set-up,\" she admits. \"That issue - when does the real stop and the artificial begin? - is at the very heart of documentary. Is documentary ever real?\" </p> <p>She winces when I suggest that the attempt at convergence failed. \"I can't say failed, but its strengths are in the relationship stuff that would have happened anyway.\" </p> <p>It's worth pointing out, as it isn't explained in the series, that Mapplebeck and her artist subjects are friends, and the piece is to form the backbone of a PhD the director is working on. Inevitably, both of these facts bring an element of compromise to a documentary project, and Mapplebeck's position is infuriatingly woolly: \"It's creative documentary, it's reality TV, and that's what we're working with,\" she proffers ambiguously. </p> <p>The more she is pushed on what she tried to do, the more confusing is her response: \"I wanted an intimacy and an intensity,\" she explains. \"I wanted to make an antidote to the docu-soap and return to documentary portraiture of old - cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9, and the way that manifested with Paul Watson's The Family.\" But then she says: \"The starting point was the whole artifice of what documentary culture is, and the concept that there can ever be an objective truth which is mediated.\" </p> <p>Question whether the two ideas are compatible, and she shrugs: \"As long as you're getting to something interesting.\" </p> <p>As far as Mapplebeck is concerned, whatever we might consider Smart Hearts to be, the one thing she is adamant about is that it is an authored work - in fashionable television vernacular, what is known as a signature documentary. Yet if we are to salvage anything stimulating and provocative from this unfulfilled experiment, then it is not Mapplebeck's largely ineffective and often apparently spurious self-reflexive directorial interjections, but the unrestrained venom of Brendan's diaries and Claire's bizarrely mannered on-screen image; it is perhaps not so much that these subjects are too smart for their own programme, rather that they are too smart for this director. </p> <p>\"There must be over 300 hours of footage,\" Brendan suggests. \"You just get bored and start rehearsing things over in your mind before you turn on the camera.\" He's disappointed that the programmes have taken a traditional narrative approach: \"They're so short you only get the dramatic moments. I don't think it's fair and I'm certainly not happy with it. It's like looking in the mirror another way; the media are the Antichrist.\" He's laughing, but both he and Lisa were upset by the level of personal criticism they suffered following the pilot: \"Television is judged by different criteria from other media,\" says Lisa. \"In art we are accustomed to a much higher level of acceptance, and it was shocking to be pummelled.\" </p> <p>The web side of the project was more interesting to all three: \"I could move those cameras wherever I wanted,\" says Claire. \"The website was my gallery space.\" She, like the others, brushes off any suggestion that they may have been exploited: \"I only expose myself if I'm asked what I consider to be a decent question, otherwise I keep quiet. It took a long time for Victoria to get into my head.\" </p> <p>If Smart Hearts, and the 24-hour webcasts which proliferate on the net prove anything, it is that greater access doesn't equal more insight; it is merely the illusion of disclosure. Mapplebeck bristles: \"You can do a portrait of someone which can be a portrait of a performance - I'm going 3D, but I'm not saying that means I'm going inside, that I'm getting the absolute essence of a person. Documentary is a relationship about who's seducing who, and to me, when that's an open text, that's good television.\"</p>",

The Imperial Lord Ferg would invite knackered Dutchman Ruud van Nistelrooy over to Manchester this autumn to help in his rehabilitation. He would take part in training with the United squad, look at some of Jaap Stam's stirring watercolours, and be given a personal tour around David Beckham's collection of spangly belts. It would have been a rare treat for the Lowlander as far as the Imperial Lord was concerned. But were PSV Eindhoven having any of it? Were they edam.</p> <p>You see, PSV have this idea in their heads that, because van Nistelrooy is their player, it isn't up to United to decide who he trains with. Silly idea we know, but it hasn't stopped them getting hot under the collar about it. Just look at PSV chairman Harry van Raay fly off the handle. \"I think Ferguson should be ashamed of himself.

But maybe they shouldn't take it as too big a slight on their club - because we reckon Gin has another agenda, like sticking it up the Tottenham manager, Arsenal's George Graham. \"George Graham is living on the edge,\" the French winger said, sharpening (then shampooing) a knife. \"He has to provide something big this year - otherwise he is finished.\" Unlike Ginola, of course, who is under no pressure to perform and has it all to look forward to. THE RUMOUR MILL Aston Villa want to sign Real Madrid's Savio, according to reports. The Brazilian left-winger has, like Steve McManaman, been told his opportunities are limited at the Bernabeu and is available for \u00a37.5m. Villa will, however, face strong competition from Brazilian side Corinthians. Newcastle and Coventry are in competition over Wimbledon's Jason Euell. Celta Vigo are interested in Newcastle's misfit defender Marcelino. Norwich are interested in Colchester's Lomana Tresor Lua Lua as a replacement for \u00a36m Craig Bellamy. NEWS IN BRIEF Peter Taylor has reassured Steve Guppy of his future at Leicester after the winger spoke of his displeasure at being left out of the squad against Aston Villa on Saturday. \"This sort of thing is going to happen more and more often now we have a bigger squad,\" Taylor said this afternoon after talks with the England winger. \"Steve's a terrific lad and a good player, but it's inevitable that some people are going to be disappointed.\" Paul Ritchie is expected to finalise his \u00a3500,000 move to Manchester City from Rangers later today. The 25-year-old defender has passed his medical and has been training with City this morning. Meanwhile, Scotland manager Craig Brown has admitted that Ritchie will not be in his squad for the World Cup qualifier in Latvia. \"Paul just hasn't been playing so he will miss out,\" Brown told the Daily Record. Norwich have signed defender Brian McGovern, 20, from Arsenal for \u00a350,000 after he impressed on loan at Carrow Road. The Canaries are also set to give a trial to American international defender Gregg Berhalter. Reading have signed Jamie Cureton from Bristol Rovers for \u00a3250,000. Birmingham striker Geoff Horsfield is waiting on the results of a scan to determine whether he has broken his leg. Phil Neal will auction his four European Cup medals, eight League Championship medals and 20 England caps in an auction of football memorabilia in London next month. Scotland U-21 squad to face Latvia next week: Ryan Esson (Aberdeen), Paul Gallacher (Dundee United), James Langfield (Dundee), Colin Stewart (Kilmarnock), Stephen Caldwell (Newcastle United), Peter Canero (Kilmarnock), Chris Doig (Nottingham Forest), Stuart Fraser (Luton Town), Andrew Jordan (Bristol City), Robbie Neilson (Hearts), Lee Wilkie (Dundee), Warren Cummings (Chelsea), Craig Easton (Dundee United), Richard Hughes (Bournemouth), Ian Murray (Hibernian), James Paterson (Dundee United), Scott Severin (Hearts), Michael Stewart (Manchester United), Mark Burchill (Celtic), Kevin Kyle (Sunderland), Kenny Miller (Rangers), Alex Notman (Manchester United), Derek Young (Aberdeen).

What are the figures like?\" Granted he's been on holiday, but really, there's no excuse. Sitting in his glass-walled meeting room on day 33 of the country's latest TV phenomenon, the director-general of the BBC must be the only person in the media who doesn't have an opinion on whom to evict. </p> <p>Seven months into his term as DG, Dyke looks tanned, fit, healthy and chirpy. There is no visible deterioration of his general appearance with which to chart the traumas of the year thus far. John, now Lord, Birt didn't leave the BBC until February, but Dyke has just about been in Broadcasting House for a year now. Long enough, you can't help but fear, to have gone native. </p> <p>Certainly long enough for a holiday in Malaysia and Singapore with the family, from which he's returned to write his MacTaggart lecture to be delivered on Friday. It will be his second MacTaggart - a previously unoffered honour. The last, just six years ago, emphasised the need for broadcasters, particularly the BBC, to stand up to government. Judging by his mood, his opinions haven't changed on that front. </p> <p>He will not spoil his lecture today. As it will spell out his vision of the future of the BBC, Dyke's BBC, we can make a good guess at what it might contain. Media mystics, of which there are many, suggest we might hear news of EastEnders - there have been rumours for some time that the soap will increase its number of weekly episodes - and perhaps a decision about moving the 9pm news bulletin to 10pm which seems inevitable. </p> <p>But those are the teasers. The meat of Dyke's speech will deal with his plans for the BBC's television networks. Already spoiling for a fight are those who believe the future of BBC 1 is under threat from an apparent Dyke initiative to move all the clever programmes to BBC 2 - leaving BBC 1 in some kind of Noel's House Party hell and somehow rather woollily using the two digital channels, Choice and Knowledge (for these purposes renamed BBC 3 and 4) to mop up the rest of the output. Doubtless somewhere at the heart of this fancy is a kernel of a plan. Dyke's friends admit he likes to float an idea out and test the reaction before settling on something less drastic. </p> <p>Clearly the casual floating of ideas leads to outraged reactions, but Dyke says he is unconcerned by the outrage professed thus far. \"The reaction is based on a false premise so I'm not concerned at all.\" People have got the wrong idea, he says, because they always do. \"What always happens is something gets in there as an idea. It then gets into the cuttings as something real, then everyone thinks that it's happened. That was never the intent.\" </p> <p>Why float the ideas then? \"I don't float 'em publicly. They get public. Everything gets public out of here. But if you want to have an open, interesting environment, then the cost of it is that stuff gets out and gets picked up. That's a price worth paying. Because actually you want that environment. </p> <p>\"The idea that on BBC1 we're not going to have factual programmes or news and current affairs is just not true. But what is an interesting idea is . . .\" he stops. This is unlike Dyke, who in all his previous existences (at Pearson TV and further back at LWT and TV-am) has been admirably unable to resist a frank answer to a straight question. It hardly seems necessary to add that this has not been a popular style among senior BBC executives of recent years. (He's not very good at the BBC-style answer either. Later on, he stops in the middle of a story with, \"hang on, I'd better be careful what I say\" - it's hardly the seamless stuff of Alastair Campbell's dreams.) </p> <p>\"What you have to do, and this is what I keep banging on about and I shall be banging on about again in the MacTaggart, is you have to say 'look, if this government wants digital switch-over at some point this decade, that means at some stage every home is going to be a digital home. At that stage the BBC will have a number of channels in every home. Therefore you have to say between here and there, what is the emerging channel portfolio you need? </p> <p>\"The trouble is it's catch-22. What you'd really quite like is to have that [portfolio] now. The difficulty is you've got a large part of the population who will not be digital till they have to be, and they pay their licence fee and they deserve to have the best of the BBC and you can't deny them. It's a journey between now and there.\" </p> <p>He argues, reasonably, that change at the BBC always means criticism. \"Always. I've read it all. I've read a lot of it in the last few weeks.\" Most of Dyke's initiatives so far, though, have been lauded and applauded. The honeymoon period, stumbling only slightly on the twin obstacles of the Queen Mother's birthday pageant and the failed bid to retain the Premier League highlights, extended right up to the changes to BBC1. </p> <p>\"Yeah, but everything else is irrelevant. Right? Everything else is about finding money. In the end, what is television about? What is radio about? It's about a combination of money and talent. You're not going to get talent to work here if they don't like the place - if they think it's vicious or unpleasant or bureaucratic or all the rest of it, so you've got to change that. </p> <p>\"Secondly, you've got to find money. Which means to find 24% of the money in this place being spent running the place is just not acceptable, right? What matters is what goes out. What we listen to, what we use. The rest is just organisational stuff. </p> <p>\"So I mean it's easy, isn't it? I come in and say: 'I believe in programmes and I'm going to give you more money' and they're gonna love me, aren't they? They're going to love you for saying that. That's the easy stuff. The real question is, once you've got the money available, can we free up that talent and make this an exciting place to work for creative people? Cos if we can't, we're dead.\" </p> <p>It's a recurring theme of Dyke's fabled management technique that he believes the workplace should be fun. He's said it many times. Anyone who talks to BBC employees on a regular basis would find it hard to believe that the corridors are ringing with joy just now. </p> <p>Do you think this a fun place to work at the moment? \"For me?\" No. Not for you. For everyone else. If it's not fun for you, you can go. He is slightly riled. \" They can go. That's what I said on day one. 'If you don't like it here, go somewhere else'. People get trapped into places that they don't need to be trapped in. This is an industry that's booming. </p> <p>\"One person that left came to me and they described their last couple of years and they had been very unhappy. And I just said, 'Well why don't you leave?' And they said, 'Do you know I never thought about that.' If you're unhappy, my view of the world is that you change it. You. The world isn't going to change it for you. You change it. Do something else.\" </p> <p>But, you still have the responsibility to make the culture of your corporation happy. \"Sure you've got to make it happy. It's supposed to be fun.\" So, do you think they're having fun? Dyke sighs. \"It depends where you are. I mean . . . No. Being here in an organisation where a lot of people are being made redundant if they're around you is not nice. It's very unpleasant . . . I hate doing it. All I can say is we treat people very fairly and they happen to be lucky that they're moving out into a labour market at the moment in this industry which is booming.\" </p> <p>How many people have actually been sacked? \"Dunno.\" Again, this is not like Dyke. Roughly? \"Some people saw the writing on the wall and went away. We expect to shed 1,200 jobs. They won't all be fired. There are areas where we got rid of 40% of the staff and we're having to recruit people because we haven't got rid of them, they just left. </p> <p>\"I don't like doing it. I didn't come here to do it. But at the end of the day the obligation upon us must be to put as much of the money on to the screen as we can.\" </p> <p>Have you sacked anyone yourself? Pause. \"Yeah.\" Not in the past, here at the BBC? \"Yeah. Well not sacked, I don't say sacked. But yes.\" What do you say to them? \"Er, what I say them is what I say to everyone - it is not your fault. It is not their fault. The world changes and organisations change. There is not a lot you can do about it.\" </p> <p>But a place like the BBC develops a mind of its own. While there remain \"lifers\", those who have worked in the corporation for their entire career and are now running huge chunks of it, it seems inevitable that they will recreate their new streamlined departments in the image of those which were there before. Like a persistent verucca, the suits spring up and regrow just where they were before. </p> <p>It's impossible to prevent, Dyke declares, adding that the BBC will need a further restructure in around five years' time. \"All organisations do it. If you're not taking out overhead you're putting it on. There is no in-between.\" </p> <p>That's why he has introduced the target. The 24% of the BBC's income which is spent on bureaucracy is unacceptable. He wants to get it down to 15%. \"I can understand having worked here why the bureaucracy can become too big. I suspect it's the same in any public sector organisation. Because when you sit in a profit and loss company and you think of a way of saving \u00a31m, you put it on to your profit and that profit goes up by 15%, so it's probably worth about \u00a320m in value to your company. </p> <p>\"If you sit in the BBC where all you do is spend money, you spend \u00a32.2bn a year so \u00a31m is . . .\" (he snaps his fingers). His much-vaunted cost-cutting initiatives - banning croissants at BBC breakfast meetings and chauffeur-driven cars - are about changing the culture rather than the actual savings involved, he points out. \"If people want fresh flowers on their desks then they can pay for them. And we've put a ban on booking cars. You're not allowed to have more than 15 minutes' waiting time and we've put on a bus service between the bits of the BBC . . . Those things are about saying, 'look we don't waste money'.\" </p> <p>In his first months the paperwork situation has improved, he says, to aid his notoriously short attention span. \"Once people began to understand I wasn't going to read it they cut it short . . . I always carried all my paper around in boxes. Once I lost one. It didn't seem to make any difference. What I do is have about 10 ideas going. That's what I'm interested in.\" </p> <p>He's also anxious to eradicate what he calls the \"report mentality\" of the BBC, but what others - notably Private Eye - have termed Birtspeak. \"I think one of the dangers is there was almost a culture here of: 'having written the paper, that was the end of it'. I'm not interested in papers, I'm interested in what we do. Do you know what I mean?\" Oh yes. I vividly recall Extending Choice - the BBC's Role in the Digital Age. \"Yeah. My view is, Look, the paper's irrelevant. What are we going to do? What are we going to change?\" </p> <p>Of course, he won't say what he will change about the output, but he's not a fan of endlessly imitating formats. Describing the imitations of Changing Rooms and Driving School which inhabit much of the BBC and its rivals, he says television \"milks everything\" and \"eats material\". Asked if any BBC network is at the top of its game, he answers that the radio stations are doing well and talks about a new-found appreciation of Radio 2. BBC 1, he says, has got some good bits but needs more and BBC 2 \"is still, erm, not sure what it is\". Dyke says that, unlike Channel 4, BBC 2 never has had a strong sense of its identity. It's perhaps more fair to say that like Channel 4, BBC 2 has experienced peaks and troughs of self-knowledge - as Channel 5 found it when it launched, no matter how much you spend on branding or marketing, channels tend to define themselves around two or three hit shows. Dyke knows this. </p> <p>Dyke has been careful in all his talk of BBC revolution to be sensitive to the Birt years (\"John and I believed in very similar things, I just think we have a very different style of management\"). The logical inference that the shape of the BBC will hence be similar under Dyke to under Birt, is swiftly denied, however. \"No. Because I think . . . I think . . . If you want organisations to change you have to carry the staff with you. If you can't carry the staff with you, you can't change it.\" Dyke wrote a (largely ignored) report on the health service for the government a couple of years ago and it's there that he sees parallels with the BBC. </p> <p>\"The problem with the health service, and you saw it in the BBC, was that the people down on the coalface thought they did it despite the management and despite the organisation - not because of it. That was the biggest change you had to make. Somehow John had lost contact, the relationship with the people who worked here. You can't do that, because otherwise there's no purpose. I actually believe that organisations only work when there is a common belief in what you're trying to achieve. And that's most of what I spend my time doing.\" </p> <p>He confesses it's been difficult to adjust. Though he will admit to few low points, saying he is too much of an optimist to see life in that way, he is surprisingly animated when he brings up the row the Times created about his shareholdings. Recognising that he is a man of considerable personal wealth, the BBC governors gave him a number of months to dispose of various shares - notably in Granada Group - that he owned, before taking over as DG. He is still bruised by the coverage of what the Times perceived to be his dishonesty.</p> <p> \"It was deeply unfair. I was doing precisely what the BBC had asked me to do. I didn't even negotiate a contract. When I got the job I just signed what they wanted. The suggestion that somehow you were corrupt for taking the job when in all honesty no one, well certainly not me, would take it for the money. I've got enough money, I don't need the money.</p> <p> \"And suddenly you realise you're in a much, much more political world. That's it. You're closer to the world of politics than you are to the world of business and I don't like that a lot. I chose many years ago not to be a politician. They're the bits I don't like. I'm familiar with it, but I still find being slagged off by some second-rate backbench MP a pain in the arse.\"</p> <p> A senior opposition figure gave him some advice, he said. It was along the lines of, if you really want to change the BBC, stay away from Westminster. \"I think there's some truth in that. It's not the role of broadcasters to be in governments' pockets\".</p> <p> As a sceptic on the subject of external content regulation, he wouldn't change the board of governors, he protests, even if he could (he can't). His review of BBC Worldwide, the BBC's commercial arm, is next on the list. There he predicts more joint ventures with outside companies and will not rule out selling off chunks of the BBC, such as some of BBC Online, if the numbers add up.</p> <p> So he can change staff morale, the report culture, he can move money from structure to output and he can sell off bits of the BBC but he can't change the governors, the political interference or the criticism. And one more thing. It's quite warm in here, I observe. \"Don't get me going.\" he responds. \"The Chinese minister for culture came here and he said, 'Mr Dyke, it is very warm in here, could you turn down the heating?' I said: 'Minister there are some things I can do about the BBC and some I can't. One thing I can't do is change the air conditioning.'\" He laughs and laughs. He hasn't changed that much.</p> <p><strong>Stop moaning or leave: Dyke's first year at the BBC</strong></p> <p><strong>By Jason Deans</strong></p> <p>&lt;s</p> <p><strong>June 1999 </strong></p> <p><strong>24:</strong> Dyke is appointed BBC director-general following weeks of political manoeuvring.

I've read a lot of it in the last few weeks.\" Most of Dyke's initiatives so far, though, have been lauded and applauded. The honeymoon period, stumbling only slightly on the twin obstacles of the Queen Mother's birthday pageant and the failed bid to retain the Premier League highlights, extended right up to the changes to BBC1. \"Yeah, but everything else is irrelevant. Right? Everything else is about finding money. In the end, what is television about? What is radio about? It's about a combination of money and talent. You're not going to get talent to work here if they don't like the place - if they think it's vicious or unpleasant or bureaucratic or all the rest of it, so you've got to change that. \"Secondly, you've got to find money. Which means to find 24% of the money in this place being spent running the place is just not acceptable, right? What matters is what goes out. What we listen to, what we use. The rest is just organisational stuff. \"So I mean it's easy, isn't it? I come in and say: 'I believe in programmes and I'm going to give you more money' and they're gonna love me, aren't they? They're going to love you for saying that. That's the easy stuff. The real question is, once you've got the money available, can we free up that talent and make this an exciting place to work for creative people? Cos if we can't, we're dead.\" It's a recurring theme of Dyke's fabled management technique that he believes the workplace should be fun. He's said it many times. Anyone who talks to BBC employees on a regular basis would find it hard to believe that the corridors are ringing with joy just now. Do you think this a fun place to work at the moment? \"For me?\" No. Not for you. For everyone else. If it's not fun for you, you can go. He is slightly riled. \" They can go. That's what I said on day one. 'If you don't like it here, go somewhere else'. People get trapped into places that they don't need to be trapped in. This is an industry that's booming. \"One person that left came to me and they described their last couple of years and they had been very unhappy. And I just said, 'Well why don't you leave?' And they said, 'Do you know I never thought about that.' If you're unhappy, my view of the world is that you change it. You. The world isn't going to change it for you. You change it. Do something else.\" But, you still have the responsibility to make the culture of your corporation happy. \"Sure you've got to make it happy. It's supposed to be fun.\" So, do you think they're having fun? Dyke sighs. \"It depends where you are. I mean . . . No. Being here in an organisation where a lot of people are being made redundant if they're around you is not nice. It's very unpleasant . . . I hate doing it. All I can say is we treat people very fairly and they happen to be lucky that they're moving out into a labour market at the moment in this industry which is booming.\" How many people have actually been sacked? \"Dunno.\" Again, this is not like Dyke. Roughly? \"Some people saw the writing on the wall and went away. We expect to shed 1,200 jobs. They won't all be fired. There are areas where we got rid of 40% of the staff and we're having to recruit people because we haven't got rid of them, they just left. \"I don't like doing it. I didn't come here to do it. But at the end of the day the obligation upon us must be to put as much of the money on to the screen as we can.\" Have you sacked anyone yourself? Pause. \"Yeah.\" Not in the past, here at the BBC? \"Yeah. Well not sacked, I don't say sacked. But yes.\" What do you say to them? \"Er, what I say them is what I say to everyone - it is not your fault. It is not their fault. The world changes and organisations change. There is not a lot you can do about it.\" But a place like the BBC develops a mind of its own. While there remain \"lifers\", those who have worked in the corporation for their entire career and are now running huge chunks of it, it seems inevitable that they will recreate their new streamlined departments in the image of those which were there before. Like a persistent verucca, the suits spring up and regrow just where they were before. It's impossible to prevent, Dyke declares, adding that the BBC will need a further restructure in around five years' time. \"All organisations do it. If you're not taking out overhead you're putting it on. There is no in-between.\" That's why he has introduced the target. The 24% of the BBC's income which is spent on bureaucracy is unacceptable. He wants to get it down to 15%. \"I can understand having worked here why the bureaucracy can become too big. I suspect it's the same in any public sector organisation. Because when you sit in a profit and loss company and you think of a way of saving \u00a31m, you put it on to your profit and that profit goes up by 15%, so it's probably worth about \u00a320m in value to your company. \"If you sit in the BBC where all you do is spend money, you spend \u00a32.2bn a year so \u00a31m is . . .\" (he snaps his fingers). His much-vaunted cost-cutting initiatives - banning croissants at BBC breakfast meetings and chauffeur-driven cars - are about changing the culture rather than the actual savings involved, he points out. \"If people want fresh flowers on their desks then they can pay for them. And we've put a ban on booking cars. You're not allowed to have more than 15 minutes' waiting time and we've put on a bus service between the bits of the BBC . . . Those things are about saying, 'look we don't waste money'.\" In his first months the paperwork situation has improved, he says, to aid his notoriously short attention span. \"Once people began to understand I wasn't going to read it they cut it short . . . I always carried all my paper around in boxes. Once I lost one. It didn't seem to make any difference. What I do is have about 10 ideas going. That's what I'm interested in.\" He's also anxious to eradicate what he calls the \"report mentality\" of the BBC, but what others - notably Private Eye - have termed Birtspeak. \"I think one of the dangers is there was almost a culture here of: 'having written the paper, that was the end of it'. I'm not interested in papers, I'm interested in what we do. Do you know what I mean?\" Oh yes. I vividly recall Extending Choice - the BBC's Role in the Digital Age. \"Yeah. My view is, Look, the paper's irrelevant. What are we going to do? What are we going to change?\" Of course, he won't say what he will change about the output, but he's not a fan of endlessly imitating formats. Describing the imitations of Changing Rooms and Driving School which inhabit much of the BBC and its rivals, he says television \"milks everything\" and \"eats material\". Asked if any BBC network is at the top of its game, he answers that the radio stations are doing well and talks about a new-found appreciation of Radio 2. BBC 1, he says, has got some good bits but needs more and BBC 2 \"is still, erm, not sure what it is\". Dyke says that, unlike Channel 4, BBC 2 never has had a strong sense of its identity. It's perhaps more fair to say that like Channel 4, BBC 2 has experienced peaks and troughs of self-knowledge - as Channel 5 found it when it launched, no matter how much you spend on branding or marketing, channels tend to define themselves around two or three hit shows. Dyke knows this. Dyke has been careful in all his talk of BBC revolution to be sensitive to the Birt years (\"John and I believed in very similar things, I just think we have a very different style of management\"). The logical inference that the shape of the BBC will hence be similar under Dyke to under Birt, is swiftly denied, however. \"No. Because I think . . . I think . . . If you want organisations to change you have to carry the staff with you. If you can't carry the staff with you, you can't change it.\" Dyke wrote a (largely ignored) report on the health service for the government a couple of years ago and it's there that he sees parallels with the BBC. \"The problem with the health service, and you saw it in the BBC, was that the people down on the coalface thought they did it despite the management and despite the organisation - not because of it. That was the biggest change you had to make. Somehow John had lost contact, the relationship with the people who worked here. You can't do that, because otherwise there's no purpose. I actually believe that organisations only work when there is a common belief in what you're trying to achieve. And that's most of what I spend my time doing.\" He confesses it's been difficult to adjust. Though he will admit to few low points, saying he is too much of an optimist to see life in that way, he is surprisingly animated when he brings up the row the Times created about his shareholdings. Recognising that he is a man of considerable personal wealth, the BBC governors gave him a number of months to dispose of various shares - notably in Granada Group - that he owned, before taking over as DG. He is still bruised by the coverage of what the Times perceived to be his dishonesty. \"It was deeply unfair. I was doing precisely what the BBC had asked me to do. I didn't even negotiate a contract. When I got the job I just signed what they wanted. The suggestion that somehow you were corrupt for taking the job when in all honesty no one, well certainly not me, would take it for the money. I've got enough money, I don't need the money. \"And suddenly you realise you're in a much, much more political world. That's it. You're closer to the world of politics than you are to the world of business and I don't like that a lot. I chose many years ago not to be a politician. They're the bits I don't like. I'm familiar with it, but I still find being slagged off by some second-rate backbench MP a pain in the arse.\" A senior opposition figure gave him some advice, he said. It was along the lines of, if you really want to change the BBC, stay away from Westminster. \"I think there's some truth in that. It's not the role of broadcasters to be in governments' pockets\". As a sceptic on the subject of external content regulation, he wouldn't change the board of governors, he protests, even if he could (he can't). His review of BBC Worldwide, the BBC's commercial arm, is next on the list. There he predicts more joint ventures with outside companies and will not rule out selling off chunks of the BBC, such as some of BBC Online, if the numbers add up. So he can change staff morale, the report culture, he can move money from structure to output and he can sell off bits of the BBC but he can't change the governors, the political interference or the criticism. And one more thing. It's quite warm in here, I observe. \"Don't get me going.\" he responds. \"The Chinese minister for culture came here and he said, 'Mr Dyke, it is very warm in here, could you turn down the heating?' I said: 'Minister there are some things I can do about the BBC and some I can't. One thing I can't do is change the air conditioning.'\" He laughs and laughs. He hasn't changed that much. Stop moaning or leave: Dyke's first year at the BBC By Jason Deans p&gt; August 1999 5: The Davies committee report recommends that the BBC's future funding needs would best be served by the introduction of a di/p&gt; icence-fee. November 1999 1: Dyke joins the BBC as director-general designate, beginning an uneasy peri&amp;l rong&gt;g&gt; strong&gt; p&gt; ual-key leadership with Birt. January 2000 1: Birt is made a life peer and it is announced that he will be leaving the BBC at the end of January, two months earlier than planned. 20: Dyke defuses a growing row about conflict of interest by selling his \u00a36m Granada holding. tro rong&gt; Birt's last day as DG. February 2000 1: On his first day as director-general, Dyke tells BBC staff to stop moaning or leave. 21: Chris Smith gives the BBC a licence-fee rise equivalent to \u00a3200m a year for seven years, rather than a dig cence fee. ith's \"toug nce-fee in ent on programmes from 76% to 85% over the next five years. June 2000 12: Dyke's right-hand man, director of television, Mark Thompson, unveils plans to move from mixed schedules to genre-based channels, prompting fears that BBC1 will be dumbed down. 14: ITV snatches Match of the Day Premier League highlights. The BBC wins back live FA Cup Final rights from ITV, but it is small compensation. 21: After criticism from about the e quality of BBC1 output, Dyke promises \"fundamental change\" and more money. July 2000 10: Dyke announces that up to 1,100 jobs will go as part of his restruc- turing, saving \u00a3750m over six years. 13: Dyke tells the commons media select committee that the corporation must adapt to a digital environment, defending proposals to move to genre-based channels. BBC1 will become an entertainment service, but will still carry current affairs.",

Zambia has one of the world's worst health records - life expectancy is falling and child malnutrition rising - but by 2002 it will be spending twice as much paying back western creditors as it will on basic health care. \"For a country whose human development indicators are deteriorating as rapidly as Zambia's, this is devastating,\" said Kevin Watkins, senior policy adviser at Oxfam. Oxfam's figures show that in six African countries - Mali, Burkino Faso, Tanzania, Mozambique, Zambia and Malawi - debt payments will outstrip spending on basic education even after the countries have graduated from the debt relief programme.

Spare a thought then for the browbeaten King, who has discovered that putting the statement \"I am the Real Nathan Barley and I claim my prize\" on his website, Jamie.com, has tons more drawbacks than benefits. Having been inundated with abusive emails, King wants to set the record straight: \"I've just about had enough. My big mistake was in playing along with this drivel, but abuse is abuse,\" he says.

So, did Hardy jump or was he pushed? You decide.

      "bodyText": "* On Thursday, as all hell broke loose in the Big Brother household and Nick fever reached an all-time high, fanatics all over the land stretched the Intel/Victoria Real servers to breaking point. Traffic doubled from the previous peak of 3m page impressions after web transmission was pulled for a few hours earlier the same day by an overzealous Endemol editor freaked out by the prospect of Craig beating Nick to a pulp. A few emergency meetings later, Endemol has decided not to be such a big brother and allow nature to take its course - that is, unless Tom ever does anything about his crush on Mel. *The search for Nathan Barley continues apace following the realisation that Jamie King, one-time admittee of the moniker, has now distanced himself from the title altogether. Barley, the turgid, extreme sports fanatic, new media public schoolboy, mini-skateboard-riding, gadget-obsessed star of a fictional show on satirical website TVgohome.com, is gaining quite a following. Spare a thought then for the browbeaten King, who has discovered that putting the statement \"I am the Real Nathan Barley and I claim my prize\" on his website, Jamie.com, has tons more drawbacks than benefits. Having been inundated with abusive emails, King wants to set the record straight: \"I've just about had enough. My big mistake was in playing along with this drivel, but abuse is abuse,\" he says. Stand up the real Nathan Barley, whoever you are. *New media itinerant Julian Hardy is back on the move. Hardy, who took on the managing director's job at Freeserve in March, has decided to leave, so the internal memo said. \"This is an entirely mutual agreement between the company and Julian, and reflects a change in Julian's initial expectations of his role and the way in which the role subsequently developed,\" it explained. So, did Hardy jump or was he pushed? You decide. Hardy's CV now boasts top positions at Emap Online, Capital Interactive, IPC Electric and MTVi, but given that the latter two and the Freeserve job combined lasted less than a year, surely he is a sure-fire contender for Itchy Feet of the Year award? new.media@theguardian.com",

Former music producer. </p> <p> <strong> What's the clever idea? </strong> \"Creating audio branding for digital media formats. Audio can have massive effect on the user, taking the form of specific split-second sonic mnemonics, such as the one we created for BT which completely crossed media, or as general musical themes. It creates an atmosphere reflecting the visual image the client is trying to convey.

Audio heightens visual awareness, creates audio brand association, helps navigation and enhances a site. Rather than imposing old linear audio, we think how audio can best fit in the new digital format. As long as it's rhythmic, looping, mixed well and sounds great coming out of small computer speakers, there isn't really a creative boundary.\" </p> <p> <strong> How does it work? </strong> \"We find out how clients see their existing visual images and where they'd like to take them in the new media campaign. Then we create the audio plan, working out what's possible technically and creatively. After that, we deliver all the separate elements. The main three forms that audio takes are rhythmic musical loops, atmospheric sound design loops and auditory icons and soft effects working on the top of those loops. It can't jar, it's got to feel smooth and work well whenever it's played. We've just finished working on the Dr Marten's website, which has a time-line section through different decades.

      "body": "<p>Of all the great archaeological sites of the Mediterranean, Butrint must surely be the least spoilt. Set amid groves of eucalyptus trees by the shores of a deserted salt-water lake, it combines around one castle-topped hill the spectacular remains of nearly 3,000 years of successive civilisations: towering Illyrian walls, ancient Greek amphitheatres and temples, Roman bath houses and mosaics, Byzantine basilicas and baptistries, Venetian towers and French and Ottoman fortifications.</p> <p>But for all these glories, Butrint attracted only 262 foreign visitors last year. No souvenir shops, ice cream vans, tourist coaches or car parks disturb the tranquillity of a city once compared by Virgil to Troy and only abandoned in the 19th century. Instead crickets, lizards and harmless snakes have the run of its well-kept ruins.</p> <p>The explanation for this startling lack of interest is that Butrint is in Albania.

      "bodyText": "Of all the great archaeological sites of the Mediterranean, Butrint must surely be the least spoilt. Set amid groves of eucalyptus trees by the shores of a deserted salt-water lake, it combines around one castle-topped hill the spectacular remains of nearly 3,000 years of successive civilisations: towering Illyrian walls, ancient Greek amphitheatres and temples, Roman bath houses and mosaics, Byzantine basilicas and baptistries, Venetian towers and French and Ottoman fortifications. But for all these glories, Butrint attracted only 262 foreign visitors last year. No souvenir shops, ice cream vans, tourist coaches or car parks disturb the tranquillity of a city once compared by Virgil to Troy and only abandoned in the 19th century. Instead crickets, lizards and harmless snakes have the run of its well-kept ruins. The explanation for this startling lack of interest is that Butrint is in Albania. Europe's poorest country, Albania is still reeling from the economic and social breakdown that followed the collapse of communism, the grotesque pyramid investment scheme crisis, mass emigration and the Kosovo war. The Foreign Office continues to issue blood-curdling warnings about travel to Albania. But the external neglect of Butrint cannot last. The site could hardly be more accessible, lying little more than a couple of miles across the sea from Corfu, one of Fortress Europe's more successful magnets of industrial tourism. Fifteen years ago, the Albanian coast opposite Corfu bristled with pill boxes, built by the Stalinophile Enver Hoxha to defend his Balkan fastness against all comers, and legends abounded of unsuspecting yachtspeople who accidentally strayed over to the \"land of the eagles\" and spent a night in the cells. Now there are daily excursions by hydrofoil three times a week from Corfu Town to the Albanian port of Saranda, with a bus laid on to take visitors the 12 panoramic but pot-holed miles to Butrint. But they are scarcely marketed with enthusiasm by the Corfu tour operators, who greet requests for tickets with thinly disguised incredulity and distaste. \"The Corfiots tell people we have horns and a tail,\" says Spiro Angjeli, Albanian polyglot economist turned tour guide and brother of the country's finance minister. \"But, as you see, they're only very small tails.\" There has been little traditional love lost between Greeks and Albanians and the combination of the post-communist influx of desperate Albanian migrants and the Kosovo imbroglio has only made things worse. It is also possible to detect some anxiety on the part of the Corfiots, who can boast nothing quite as exceptional as Butrint, a Unesco world heritage site. \"The Corfiots are greedy,\" complains Angjeli, who comes from Albania's Greek minority. \"They don't realise they won't lose out by bringing people here - tourists like the idea of getting two countries for one.\" Butrint visitor numbers are already climbing back from last year's Kosovo- inspired nadir, clocking up more than 8,000 so far this year, including Albanians. But strolling along the seafront at Saranda - a strikingly unthreatening place - Angjeli describes the danger he sees for the future of the town in the shape of two English lords: Rothschild, who owns a stretch of Corfu overlooking Albania, and Sainsbury, the supermarket chain president. The pair set up a Butrint Foundation in the early 1990s with the aim of developing the site and their Albanian representative, the smooth-talking Auron Tare, is now director of the Butrint National Park. Tare confirms Angjeli's fears that the foundation has all but given up on the Corfu-Saranda route in favour of bringing upmarket eco-tourists to Butrint by road from mainland Greece. If that happens, Angjeli says, Albania will lose out and Saranda will be denied the salvation it has been hoping for from the long-awaited tourist boom at Butrint.",

      "bodyText": "The body of murdered British backpacker Kirsty Jones lay undiscovered in a Thai hostel for 15 hours, an inquest was told today. Meanwhile, the Thai investigator in charge of the case has been replaced, following the failure of the police to make progress in finding the killer. The 23-year-old was murdered within an hour of returning from a night out with a friend in the northern Thai city of Chiang. After a 15-minute hearing at the Guildhall in Kirsty's home town of Brecon, Powys, the coroner brought in a verdict of unlawful killing. Coroner's officer Pc Mike Eckley told the hearing that she returned to the Aree Hostel some time after midnight. He said: \"Her friend was not staying in the hostel and they parted company. According to the autopsy report received from the Chang Mai police the time of death was around 1am.\" Pc Eckley said Kirsty's body was found at 4.30pm later that day. He added: \"She lay undiscovered for almost 15 hours. It would appear according to the information we have that she was attacked almost as soon as she returned home.\" The inquest heard a postmortem conducted in Thailand revealed Kirsty died of asphyxia due to strangulation. Powys coroner John Hollis said he was satisfied that this was the cause of death. The remains of Miss Jones were flown back to Britain from Thailand last Thursday - one week after her partially naked body was found face down on the floor of her room. Dyfed Powys police had formally identified the body using fingerprint techniques to save Miss Jones's parents, Glyn and Sue Jones of Tredomen, near Brecon, the trauma of having to do it themselves, he said. Kirsty left her home in the village of Tredomen, near Brecon, in June on a two-year round the world trip, after she had graduated with a 2.1 degree in English and media studies from Liverpool University. She had promised her parents Sue and Glyn it would be her final trip abroad before settling down and starting a career in the media. Her family, who farm 300 acres in the Mid Wales countryside, did not attend the hearing at Brecon's Guildhall yesterday. A public funeral for Miss Jones is due to be held in their local church later this week. A family spokesman said after the hearing: \"Kirsty's parents are pleased that the inquest has been concluded quickly so they can get on with the funeral arrangements. \"The family are concerned about the varying reports coming out of Thailand and it not helping them that the investigation appears to have been handled badly.

      "body": "<p>Ask anyone to name a decent TV show website - one that actually adds value to the related programme - and you'd be hard pressed to get anything other than a furrowed brow. </p> <p>The dearth of decent TV show websites is not entirely down to lack of imagination. It has a lot to do with the constraints of narrowband connections and a reluctance to invest in sites that don't get sufficient traffic. With moves towards the internet-on-TV model and the imminent arrival of broadband access, things are starting to change. </p> <p>At present, however, the consensus is that websites dedicated to TV programmes are little more than brochureware, put together by a production team that has no direct contact with the programme-makers and finds it difficult to see beyond the ubiquitous chatrooms and character profiles. </p> <p>Granada Broadband, the recently established interactive arm of Granada, is hoping to change all this on August 28, the date on which it launches its Cold Feet website. Cold Feet Online (<a href=\"http://www.ColdFeetOnline.com\" target\"_new\">www.ColdFeetOnline.com</a>) should set new standards for the way in which websites for TV shows are developed. </p> <p>Website producer Simon Bucknall says the danger in developing a higher standard of product is that future products will be judged by new benchmarks. \"We've set the standard and we don't want to go back and put out lesser products. But by starting with Cold Feet, the benchmark has been set particularly high because it gave us so much to work with: fun, interesting characters and a young, net-savvy demographic. And we were able to work very closely with the TV production crew and the actors.\" </p> <p>While most other TV crews tend not to extend a warm welcome to new-media people hanging around the set, Bucknall hopes this might change once they have seen the Cold Feet website. </p> <p>Changes are taking place in the TV industry. Programme-makers have realised that a website can add a great deal to the programme, bringing in new users and encouraging people to get involved in the show. The Big Brother site (<a href=\"http://www.bigbrother.terra.com/\" target\"_new\">www.bigbrother.terra.com</a>) is flawed, but manages at least to satisfy the viewers' desire for more footage and information. Channel 5's soon-to-launch Jailbreak will also make the website an integral part of the show. The plan is to provide daily news updates and 24-hour access to the inmates' movements via webcams, and to take the interaction further by encouraging users to register as escape committee members and mail escape tips to inmates. </p> <p>The Cold Feet site makes good use of many of the features of the show and is divided into five self-explanatory sections (The Show, Short Cuts, Catch Up, Fun and Games and The Cast). Character profiles and storyboards will be updated as each series airs. Other basic features include online chats, message boards, an archive of the first three series, competitions and cast interviews. Where the site differs from the typical TV site is in the depth of exclusive content developed for it. </p> <p>One of the innovative ideas built into the Cold Feet website is the behind-the-scenes footage filmed by the Granada Broadband website team. The clips, between three and four minutes in length, show the actors relaxing between takes and include interviews with cast and crew, outtakes and fly-on-the-wall footage of the making of the show. Two clips will be added to the site each week, building up a database of footage, which can then be sold as a finished product. </p> <p>One plan under consideration is to package the footage as a DVD and sell it to another channel, such as ITV2. Another way of making money from the site is to introduce advertisers and e-commerce part ners, such as eBay. A compelling aspect of the new site is the character-oriented email service that will be tied in to the storylines and sent out every day. The email feature will give the impression that messages are written by the characters, emailing each other about plot developments and their feelings for other characters. Having drafted in the services of the show's scriptwriter, Mike Bullen, Granada is hoping to shift the focus away from the weekly show, and develop an ongoing narrative and affiliations between the characters and the fans. </p> <p>\"The stuff we've been developing is ground-breaking, particularly the synergies we're introducing between the TV show and the interactive services,\" says Bucknall. \"By having the characters send emails to each other, we're making them appear more rounded and adding to their appeal.\" </p> <p>Little on other TV show websites can compare to this service, although the concept is not new - cK-One ran a similar email campaign based on characters from its advertising. However, other websites are similarly focusing on getting viewers involved daily with a weekly show. Hat Trick Productions' Have I Got News for You, for example, has been building up a loyal daily following with its recently launched site, Haveigotnewsforyou.com. Paul Zwillenberg, managing director of &lt; kpe &gt; Europe, a consultancy/incubator hybrid which has set up a venture with Hat Trick Productions to develop web programming (HKI), says the HIGNFY site is just a starting point.</p> <p>\"It gave us a way to understand how viewers can interact on a daily basis with a weekly programme,\" says Zwillenberg. Despite receiving no on-air promotion on the show (because the site was developed independently of the BBC), he says the feedback has been very positive, and that more than 10% of new visitors who register go on immediately to play the games featured on the site. </p> <p>The move towards a more intimate relationship with viewers - Cold Feet has 8.5m - is Granada Broadband's longer-term strategy, a strategy that sees the phasing out of the g-wizz brand. Justin Judd, controller of content and production at Granada Broadband, says it's all about turning viewers into customers through additional services. \"There is limited appetite for extra soap-related material, given that the programmes are aired so frequently, so what we have to do is find new ways of attracting people to the sites,\" says Judd. </p> <p> Having worked as a TV producer at Granada since 1994, Judd was seconded to Granada Broadband five months ago to work on closer integration between Granada's programming and its interactive services. His appointment has already paved the way for exclusive footage on the Cold Feet website, and now he's taking steps to change the brochureware sites and correct mistakes by building in more interactive content, such as Rovers Return and Woolpack pub quizzes. </p> <p>The new Granada Broadband strategy appears to be in line with the views of industry experts. Zwillenberg says: \"Broadcasters are making the same mistakes that newspapers did when they went online. It's not appropriate just to repurpose content. It's encouraging to see major media companies starting to experiment with broadband - if they don't, they'll find themselves very far back. Entertainment is to broadband what sport was to BSkyB.\" </p> <p>While things are moving in the right direction, the long-term vision - all users accessing the website via TV while watching the programme - is still some time off. Conscious of the upcoming change, Granada is gearing up to launch PowerChannel, its TV-based analogue internet set-top box, in October. The TV internet product - free, provided users participate in monthly questionnaires - will be supported by a new entertainment portal that will promote Granada Broadband's websites. By 2001, Granada PowerChannel expects to have more than 1m subscribers. </p> <p>As its name suggests, Granada Broadband is conscious that the future for broadcast entertainment on the net is heavily dependent on the uptake of broadband.

The internet has not yet hit the entertainment business. We're talking about a sea change in the way users get entertainment - but it's just the beginning.\"",

The IAAF arbitration panel, which spent four days hearing evidence on the cases of Linford Christie, Doug Walker and Gary Cadogan, announced its decision to uphold two-year bans on each athlete at 1pm this afternoon. The three had all protested their innocence in using the banned steroid nandrolone and were cleared by UK Athletics, but the IAAF maintained their suspensions internationally pending the arbitration hearing. The IAAF said: \"The arbitration panel believes that UK Athletics misdirected itself and reached an erroneous conclusion when clearing these athletes.\" The suspensions have been from the date the athletes tested positive. In a statement, Linford Christie said: \"I have always made it clear that I have no confidence in the IAAF's arbitration process and this simply reaffirms this. \"I am very disappointed that the tribunal did not feel able to accept the new scientific evidence presented to them.

Any survivors among the 118 crew were thought likely to have taken refuge in this part of the submarine, although hopes had been held out earlier that some crew could be in sheltering in another compartment. Earlier, Russia's deputy prime minister Ilya Klebanov said that the success of the 24-hour Norwegian mission to open the escape hatch meant that the British LR5 mini-sub on standby in the area would not now be used in the operation to rescue the vessel stranded under 350ft of water on the bed of the Barents sea.

New details continued to emerge of how severely the Kursk was damaged when it sank during naval exercises with reports from the sea bottom that large parts of the hull had been literally ripped apart. Russian RTR television showed film yesterday of one diver grabbing a shattered fragment of the hull, about the size of a loaf of bread, and showing it to the camera. \"Water almost instantly flooded the submarine's hull up to the fifth or sixth compartments. The crew in those sections died almost instantaneously and the submarine became uncontrollable,\" Mr Klebanov said. The deputy prime minister added that a second world war mine or a collision with a foreign submarine were possible causes of the explosion. The US and British navies, which often have submarines in the area, denied their vessels were involved. A probable scenario was that a torpedo in the Kursk's forward compartment exploded, setting off a much bigger explosion.",

He was gunned down outside a bookmaker's shop on the city's Crumlin Road. A second man was also hit and was taken to the nearby Mater Hospital suffering from wounds to his stomach. According to unconfirmed reports, the dead man was linked to the Ulster Defence Association which is involved in a bitter feud with the Ulster Volunteer Force. Both sides had earlier warned that people would be killed unless the fighting stopped. The dead man was sitting in a car outside the bookmaker's shop when he was shot. The wounded man may have been hit up to four times, according to eyewitnesses. Violence erupted between the two sides in the neighbouring Shankill Road area on Saturday when seven men were injured after UDA gunmen twice sprayed a bar during and after a big loyalist paramilitary rally which they claimed was attacked by the UVF. Later homes belonging to members and supporters of the Progressive Party, the UVF's political wing, were attacked. Earlier today John White of the Ulster Democratic Party, the UDA's political wing, called for the appointment of a go-between to try to negotiate an end to the feud, but today's shooting is likely to quash hopes of an immediate truce. Last night Peter Mandelson, the Northern Ireland secretary, called for an RUC report into the spate of incidents in loyalist areas of Belfast and appealed to loyalist paramilitaries to end the violent attacks and the destruction of property. His intervention came after Adam Ingram, the Northern Ireland security minister, met the RUC deputy chief constable, Colin Cramphorn, and senior security advisers to discuss the worsening situation of sectarian violence.",

      "bodyText": "The problems of Euan have nothing on the problems of Eefne and Necc as far as Tony Blair and the next election is concerned; Today's report on the north-south divide from Oxford Economic Forecasting makes that clear. Headlines about teenage goings-on may be bigger and more colourful temporarily, but the woes of the Engineering Employers' Federation (north east - Eefne) and the North East Chamber of Commerce (Necc) are far more significant long-term. The crux of the Oxford report is the prediction that the drift between the two halves of the country - south booming, north stagnating - is set to continue and worsen; to become that dreariest of economic measures: a downward trend. For Blair and New Labour in particular, there is also a twist of the knife. The independent forecasters say that government policy, especially on the strength of sterling, is helping to drive open the division, for all that the north includes so many Labour strongholds and so many parliamentary constituencies of Labour's frontbench. The north is hit harder because of the concentration of manufacturing, rather than the service, financial or IT industries which find it easier to jump the obstacles caused by a strong pound. The great yards and mills of Yorkshire and the north east were engines of prosperity for the region when Britannia - and sterling - ruled the world. But in an era when foreign customers are asking for bids and estimates in euros or yen, the vulnerability is that much greater. The gut reaction today has been for the Eefnes and Neccs to call for action or at least attention. A feeling of being ignored as Britain basks in overall national prosperity is overwhelming up here, especially in the north east. But calls for the government to 'persuade companies to move northwards' (Necc's instant response) are not very convincing. If the company, and above all the market, doesn't want to go north, government urgings and even grants (remember the fate of Siemens on Tyneside) cannot ultimately make a great difference. The hope is that the market is subtler than the Oxford group give it credit for being; that it recognises both the great assets of the north - less congestion, great quality of life for those in good jobs, a skilled workforce - along with the harsher realities which rule out a simple, laissez-faire belief in everyone drifting south. A report due on Thursday from the equally respected Joseph Rowntree foundation, makes it clear that this drift is not happening and will not; partly because northerners often can't afford London or south east house prices, but also because they - we! - just don't want to go. Rowntree find that only eight per cent of population growth in the south outside London in the 1990s was due to internal migration from the Midlands and north. And the north's really big movements, documented in the report, were from inner city areas to suburbs - an unfailing sign of things improving. You only have to visit any of the three northern regions' main cities (a decade ago, I would have written only Manchester or Leeds, but you can now include them all) to sense that revival. It may be slower than the south's, and especially than London's; Rowntree argues that the capital's huge imbalance with the rest of our small island is now unstoppable, can only grow and has to be planned for. But things are infinitely better in the north than they were ago and the market - in the form of 'sunrise' companies in IT, legal and financial services and the rest - will sniff that out. Mr Blair can't say that, however, any more than he can complacently say that all teenagers grow up. A PR blitz at least - on why he likes Sedgefield, why Mo likes Redcar and why Peter Mandelson loves Hartlepool - would do the north no harm at all.",

      "body": "<p>When I knew her, my Aunt Beryl lived in rural Suffolk. This was, however, not always the case. She had been rather racy in her youth and when she was 21 she did something it had never occurred to anyone in our clan to do: she moved to Birmingham. Not only did she move to Birmingham but she took up with an Indian waiter newly arrived from Bombay. Despite a complete inability to communicate, love blossomed. Aunt B blossomed, too - which was something, for she was no beauty. She had quite sharp features and ears large enough to give the impression of two small moons setting directly behind her.</p> <p>Then tragedy struck. One wet Tuesday evening the waiter met an untimely death. I can't really say too much about it because the case at the industrial tribunal was never really settled. Suffice it to say his demise was not entirely painless, involving as it did a newly cleaned linoleum floor, a surprisingly small knob of butter and an automatic chapatti-making machine. Aunt Beryl was devastated and my family united in grief for her. Never again was any one of my kin heard to order chicken tikka masala with anything approaching gusto.</p> <p>Ladened with woe, Aunt Beryl got in her car and drove away. Mile after misery mile she steered until at last she came to the small town of Wigs-on-Merriemen in the heart of the county of Suffolk. Here she settled, partly because it was beautiful and partly because it was here that the big end of her Vauxhall Viva finally gave out. Her man had died, her car had died and I think something in my aunt's spirit faded to black.</p> <p>Wigs-on-Merriemen was not so much a sleepy town as mildly catatonic. Despite this the burghers tended their houses carefully and were not shy of colourful facades. Perched on a hill, pink houses lined the high street like firm slices of fresh blancmange. Aunt Beryl's house stood at the foot of the town in a small field by itself. It was painted not pink but brilliant blue. When the sun rose behind the field, the house looked like the realisation of Chicken Lickin's worst fears. A chunk of sky come to rest on earth.</p> <p>Aunt Beryl thought the house was perfect. Unfortunately so, too, did the fieldmice. For nearly 40 years they invaded her home. Aunt B had no fight left in her. Often she would let the mice have their way and flee to her garden. There she applied herself to raising dahlias and the creation of devotional tapestry kneelers for the church on the hill. The entire town knelt in comfort thanks to sad old Aunt Beryl.</p> <p>All this went on until her 60th birthday. Then one fine June morning, Aunt B woke up, turned 60 and, for no discernible reason, her heart began to open again. My aunt knew that she would always love her waiter but at last, she was ready once more for romance.</p> <p>On that day, on the hill above my aunt's mouse-infested house of sorrow, the town was preparing for a great event. The Macclesfield Medieval Marchers were marching in. The troupe consisted of 12 men who took one month each year to tour the country and recreate medieval jousting tournaments. Among these summer knights were a chiropodist, a pig farmer, the wet fish manager from Macclesfield's Tesco and Rodney. As chance would have it, ordinarily Rodney was in pest control. Had been for 30 years. He liked his work. He understood rodents and pests, their likes and dislikes, their attitudes to life. But Rodney had a secret longing for adventure. So he gave up his traps and pellets and powders for one summer to march with the men.</p> <p>Except Rodney didn't march. He was too new to march. Rodney drove the Ford Transit van. At each fresh engagement, Rodney would park the van on the outskirts and the men would kit themselves up for the entrance march. It was no amateur affair. Much effort had been made in the provision of entirely authentic- looking costumes. Richard the Lionheart led the way in crimson and gold, followed by brocaded Lords of the Court, two pages and, the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, at each date in the tour, the marchers arranged for the loan of four sturdy horses. These hired steeds were bedecked in sumptuous cloth and carried the pride of four fully armoured knights.</p> <p>The silver suits, although copies, were correct in every detail. Visors, gauntlets, breastplates and chainmail clanked and groaned as the horses bore their charges to battle. The sun sparkled on the highly polished armour and there was not a person in Wigs-on-Merriemen who could resist giving a little cheer at such a sight. Rodney slowly brought up the rear in the van. Not for him the adulation of the crowd.</p> <p>The day went well. Battles were fought, swords brandished and local damsels rescued. By nightfall, everyone had retired to the Runt and Cockrell for a well-deserved pint. By closing, Rodney was mildly inebriated. He stepped out into the high street and realised with horror that he had forgotten to return the horses. They were still tied to a rail on the pitch.</p> <p>The fresh air hit him hard and by the time he got to his charges, he was quite drunk indeed. The moon shone upon the steeds and Rodney knew, with the clarity given only by alcohol, that this was his moment. How he got dressed in armour by himself and up on a horse no one will ever know. Patently the effort exhausted him. Instead of a triumphant moonlit perambulation, Sir Rodney fell asleep astride his mount.</p> <p>He awoke near dawn to find that the visor on his helmet had fallen shut as he slept. Still heavy with the night's activities, he leant forward and tried to unclasp the metal device. The horse mistook this move as an invitation to walk forward. The armour was heavy and Rodney had never been on a horse before. His body swayed violently and the trainee knight dug his heels in to try to gain some balance. The horse mistook this move as an invitation to begin to trot. Before he knew it, Rodney and the horse were coming round the corner at the top of the high street at a remarkably quick pace.</p> <p>The high street ran in a straight line from the top of the hill all the way down to Aunt B's house. The sun was just starting to rise and perhaps the horse saw, for the first time, the lure of the open road. Perhaps some distant echo of his forefathers' Light Brigade heroics stirred in his fetlocks for he began to gallop. Clinging on for dear life, Rodney hurtled past the pink houses, past the Runt and Cockrell and on down the cobbled hill. Through the narrow slit of his closed visor, Rodney could see little. He could feel the descent of the horse but there appeared to be nothing but blue sky ahead. At last the horse, overwhelmed by burden and speed, tripped and Rodney flew through the air.</p> <p>The summer knight flew to the heavens and into Aunt B's garden.

      "bodyText": "Renegade former M15 officer David Shayler was arrested at Dover port immediately after his arrival in Britain at 11 o'clock this morning. Uniformed officers were waiting at the building as Mr Shayler arrived on a bus accompanied by his family and dozens of photographers and journalists. Mr Shayler fled to France in 1997 after claiming two MI6 officers, who he believes should be tried for conspiracy to murder, were behind a failed attempt to assassinate Libyan leader Muammar Gadafy. It is thought he will face two charges under the Official Secrets Act for leaking information to the press, which may result in a four-year prison sentence. Mr Shayler's lawyer, John Wadham, claims to have received a guarantee from the Crown Prosecution Service that his client will be granted bail following a magistrates' hearing. This morning Mr Shayler, 34, again insisted he had leaked the information for the public good and had not compromised national security. Standing at the quayside with his brother and his partner of seven years, Annie Machon, he said: \"The important thing is that I did not damage national security. We were very responsible.\" \"A lot of MPs in Britain don't seem to give a damn about civil liberties\u0085 It really is an absolute scandal that the information which was passed to Jack Straw in 1999 is only being looked at now.\" In an indication that it may be treating Mr Shayler's claims seriously, it was revealed yesterday that Scotland Yard will also be interviewing Mr Shayler not as a suspect but as a witness, according to Mr Wadham. The confirmation that Special Branch was examining the allegations is fuelling growing speculation that Mr Shayler may never stand trial. The foreign secretary, Robin Cook, and the home secretary, Jack Straw, could even be called as witnesses in such a case. \"I think in many ways the government does not want to see me in open court because that in many ways raises more problems for them than it raises for me,\" Mr Shayler said. Mr Shayler's return is also thought to have been encouraged by the introduction of European human rights legislation, to be incorporated into British law in October, which will provide a public interest defence for secret service \"whistle-blowers\". \"It certainly gives me a defence,\" he said. \"If I was tried tomorrow without that act the judge would say that here is this man talking about secrets on television, you have to convict him.\" When he became a fugitive three years ago, Shayler said he was prepared to go to jail in order to reveal what he claimed were the illegal and incompetent actions of the British security services. However today he admitted that three months in a Parisian jail, where he was held during a failed extradition attempt by the British government, had left him feeling some trepidation as he prepared to return home. The forthcoming trial of former senior army officer Nigel Wylde could prove a test case for the new legislation. Wylde, awarded the Queen's Gallantry Medal for defusing a bomb in Ulster, will use a similar defence over charges at the Old Bailey in November that he passed military surveillance secrets to author Tony Geraghty. Success for either of them could seriously undermine the Official Secrets Act, which bars tens of thousands of Whitehall officials and military personnel from revealing sensitive information.",

      "body": "<p>Who doesn't like the Chrysler PT Cruiser? Children think it's a complete hoot, but blokes with shaved heads and no shirts on in white Ford vans want to give it a careful once-over as well. Meanwhile elderly couples on the pavement do double-takes and turn with expressions of surprised delight on their faces, as if in a bad comedy film from the early 60s. Chrysler's billboard campaign for this extraordinary blast from the past seems to have done its job. \"Look,\" people say, as you trundle past.\"It's one of those.\" </p> <p>To drive a Cruiser - especially now, while the initial British run of 2,600 models is only just beginning to seep onto the streets - is to be the object of perpetual scrutiny and curiosity, as other cars slow down or ride up slowly alongside with people hanging out of their windows. I pulled in for petrol at one point and the garage almost closed for a holiday, as staff spilled out of the kiosk and the workshop to peer in. Suddenly one appreciated a little better what it must be like to be Robbie Williams. </p> <p>PT, incidentally, stands for \"Personal Transportation\", a phrase that is completely meaningless but which, I guess, sounds zippy and purposeful when you reduce it to its initials and hitch it to the word \"Cruiser\". Whatever, it struck me, during a fond week in possession of a highly covetable deep blue model of the car, that its designer was either fantastically lucky or some kind of genius. The Cruiser seems to put you in mind of a large number of things, not all of them strictly compatible, yet somehow it doesn't end up picking an argument with itself. It flirts with many different messages, visually, yet doesn't end up being a mess of contradictions. </p> <p>Clearly, to look at, it's a blood relation of a mean and snarling all-American hot rod - one of those incautiously customised driveway dreams, jacked up at the back on tractor wheels and with big shiny lumps of engine spewing out of the bonnet. At the same time, it could have just driven down from Walton Mountain, having dropped Jim-Bob back at Ike Godsey's to pick up Grandpa's medication. It's Bonnie and Clyde, but it's also Keystone Kops. British audiences may well pick up additional hints both of London cabs and Postman Pat's van - not to mention touches of Ford Poplar, Morris Minor and a pre-war florist's delivery wagon. </p> <p>It is one of the more commercially useful discoveries of our time that whatever is out of fashion is never out of fashion, and you could never accuse Chrysler of not pursuing that proposition here. The car has a retractable radio aerial (remember them?) poking up cheekily on the left-hand side of the bonnet and just waiting to be wrenched off by a passing pedestrian - to be replaced, presumably, by a bent coat-hanger. It also has big chromium push-button door handles, which are hugely satisfying to operate and make opening the car like going to a 50s fridge. And it has thick loops of chromium serving as door-openers on the inside, and a chunky Chrysler badge as the catch for the boot. It's retro with knobs on. </p> <p>The disappointment starts when you let the handbrake off. It's almost certainly unfair to expect the unique look of the car to guarantee a nerve-tingling driving experience, but it's hard not to feel a bit let down when it drives like any other contemporary road-slogger. It's no different, really, from driving a Chrysler Neon - the company's entirely fad-free saloon - except that, being taller, the Cruiser feels more floppy going into corners. </p> <p>I drove the automatic version of the car, which I thought was disappointingly tame. Automatic transmission has its supporters, and it's fine if you're feeling lazy, but many would argue that a matter like when your engine lets you have the power you want is far too important to be handed over to the manufacturer of your car. Here, you could slap your foot down and then wait a small eternity for anything to happen. If you're driving something as uncompromising to the eye as the Cruiser, then it's a little deflating to be left for dead at some traffic lights, as I was, by a truck carrying pots of paint. </p> <p>By rights, a car that looks like this should be about as practical as a fur teacup. Here, though, the Cruiser gets especially cute, trying to prove itself more than a mere novelty by offering some of the sober assets of the hatchback and the miniature MPV. In a remarkable way, for what is essentially a conversation piece, the Cruiser hears the modern marketplace's deeply anti-style cry for a big adaptable interior and manages to drag one on board. It's not unlike sitting in a Renault Megane Scenic, or any of those mini family buses - there's room above your head and plenty of air around. And you can do all that popular, natty business with the seats - tipping them forward, collapsing them to form tables, or taking them out altogether - handily reconfiguring the interior for those occasions when you need to transport a ladder or a coffin or something. </p> <p>The big question is, are people who are looking for space and versatility in a reliable family vehicle also looking for something that might appear on the cover of a ZZ Top album? And, secondly, can they take the public scrutiny? We wait to see. </p> <p><strong> The lowdown</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Chrysler PT Cruiser </strong></p> <p><strong>Price: </strong> from \u00a314,995 </p> <p><strong> Acceleration: </strong> 0-60 in 9.6 seconds </p> <p><strong> Maximum speed: </strong> 118 mph </p> <p><strong> Consumption: </strong> 32.5 mpg (combined) </p> <p><strong> On the stereo: </strong> Dion &amp; the Belmonts </p> <p><strong> At the wheel: </strong> Ron Howard </p> <p><strong> En route for: </strong> Anywhere that sells donuts</p>",

      "bodyText": "Who doesn't like the Chrysler PT Cruiser? Children think it's a complete hoot, but blokes with shaved heads and no shirts on in white Ford vans want to give it a careful once-over as well. Meanwhile elderly couples on the pavement do double-takes and turn with expressions of surprised delight on their faces, as if in a bad comedy film from the early 60s. Chrysler's billboard campaign for this extraordinary blast from the past seems to have done its job. \"Look,\" people say, as you trundle past.\"It's one of those.\" To drive a Cruiser - especially now, while the initial British run of 2,600 models is only just beginning to seep onto the streets - is to be the object of perpetual scrutiny and curiosity, as other cars slow down or ride up slowly alongside with people hanging out of their windows. I pulled in for petrol at one point and the garage almost closed for a holiday, as staff spilled out of the kiosk and the workshop to peer in. Suddenly one appreciated a little better what it must be like to be Robbie Williams. PT, incidentally, stands for \"Personal Transportation\", a phrase that is completely meaningless but which, I guess, sounds zippy and purposeful when you reduce it to its initials and hitch it to the word \"Cruiser\". Whatever, it struck me, during a fond week in possession of a highly covetable deep blue model of the car, that its designer was either fantastically lucky or some kind of genius. The Cruiser seems to put you in mind of a large number of things, not all of them strictly compatible, yet somehow it doesn't end up picking an argument with itself. It flirts with many different messages, visually, yet doesn't end up being a mess of contradictions. Clearly, to look at, it's a blood relation of a mean and snarling all-American hot rod - one of those incautiously customised driveway dreams, jacked up at the back on tractor wheels and with big shiny lumps of engine spewing out of the bonnet. At the same time, it could have just driven down from Walton Mountain, having dropped Jim-Bob back at Ike Godsey's to pick up Grandpa's medication. It's Bonnie and Clyde, but it's also Keystone Kops. British audiences may well pick up additional hints both of London cabs and Postman Pat's van - not to mention touches of Ford Poplar, Morris Minor and a pre-war florist's delivery wagon. It is one of the more commercially useful discoveries of our time that whatever is out of fashion is never out of fashion, and you could never accuse Chrysler of not pursuing that proposition here. The car has a retractable radio aerial (remember them?) poking up cheekily on the left-hand side of the bonnet and just waiting to be wrenched off by a passing pedestrian - to be replaced, presumably, by a bent coat-hanger. It also has big chromium push-button door handles, which are hugely satisfying to operate and make opening the car like going to a 50s fridge. And it has thick loops of chromium serving as door-openers on the inside, and a chunky Chrysler badge as the catch for the boot. It's retro with knobs on. The disappointment starts when you let the handbrake off. It's almost certainly unfair to expect the unique look of the car to guarantee a nerve-tingling driving experience, but it's hard not to feel a bit let down when it drives like any other contemporary road-slogger. It's no different, really, from driving a Chrysler Neon - the company's entirely fad-free saloon - except that, being taller, the Cruiser feels more floppy going into corners. I drove the automatic version of the car, which I thought was disappointingly tame. Automatic transmission has its supporters, and it's fine if you're feeling lazy, but many would argue that a matter like when your engine lets you have the power you want is far too important to be handed over to the manufacturer of your car. Here, you could slap your foot down and then wait a small eternity for anything to happen. If you're driving something as uncompromising to the eye as the Cruiser, then it's a little deflating to be left for dead at some traffic lights, as I was, by a truck carrying pots of paint. By rights, a car that looks like this should be about as practical as a fur teacup. Here, though, the Cruiser gets especially cute, trying to prove itself more than a mere novelty by offering some of the sober assets of the hatchback and the miniature MPV. In a remarkable way, for what is essentially a conversation piece, the Cruiser hears the modern marketplace's deeply anti-style cry for a big adaptable interior and manages to drag one on board. It's not unlike sitting in a Renault Megane Scenic, or any of those mini family buses - there's room above your head and plenty of air around. And you can do all that popular, natty business with the seats - tipping them forward, collapsing them to form tables, or taking them out altogether - handily reconfiguring the interior for those occasions when you need to transport a ladder or a coffin or something. The big question is, are people who are looking for space and versatility in a reliable family vehicle also looking for something that might appear on the cover of a ZZ Top album? And, secondly, can they take the public scrutiny? We wait to see. The lowdown Chrysler PT Cruiser Price: from \u00a314,995 Acceleration: 0-60 in 9.6 seconds Maximum speed: 118 mph Consumption: 32.5 mpg (combined) On the stereo: Dion &amp; the Belmonts At the wheel: Ron Howard En route for: Anywhere that sells donuts",

      "body": "<p>Our nine month love affair with Mayfair came to an end last week and we skipped across London to new offices near Chancery Lane. </p> <p>We had completely outgrown our shared accommodation, which had seen us expand from three to 14 people. Cramped conditions were not only a pain for us, we were also proving to be an increasing burden on the fast growth of our incubating company, Extraprise, an international e-services company. </p> <p>Incubators have a mixed reputation within the industry. Some, by providing real expertise, resources and contacts have delivered considerable value to their businesses beyond that of simple investment. Others have been accused of preying on the unwary, using the promise of additional services - from office space to legal advice - as an excuse to take an unhealthily greedy share of the equity of the new business. It helps that the potential entrepreneurs most likely to be attracted to the services of an incubator also tended to be those with less business experience or commercial understanding. </p> <p>Our own incubation experience was a little unusual.

      "bodyText": "Our nine month love affair with Mayfair came to an end last week and we skipped across London to new offices near Chancery Lane. We had completely outgrown our shared accommodation, which had seen us expand from three to 14 people. Cramped conditions were not only a pain for us, we were also proving to be an increasing burden on the fast growth of our incubating company, Extraprise, an international e-services company. Incubators have a mixed reputation within the industry. Some, by providing real expertise, resources and contacts have delivered considerable value to their businesses beyond that of simple investment. Others have been accused of preying on the unwary, using the promise of additional services - from office space to legal advice - as an excuse to take an unhealthily greedy share of the equity of the new business. It helps that the potential entrepreneurs most likely to be attracted to the services of an incubator also tended to be those with less business experience or commercial understanding. Our own incubation experience was a little unusual. The founders were working for Bridgewater, a specialist growth consultancy (since taken over by extraprise).

      "body": "<p>Ferteze Nimari had lost two of her brothers and her husband was forced to bury all the dead in one grave. Later, packed into a stifling bus with sixty fellow Kosovars, the couple held onto each other as he clutched a strap suspended from the ceiling. The bus stopped in the Stankovac I refugee camp in Macedonia and they told their story. 'The tank came to our village of Sllovi. The Serb neighbours said not to worry - it was just there to observe us. But by lunchtime the next day a teenage girl lay dead in the street. Then another 15 people were killed. They told us to run into the woods and they started shooting us.'</p> <p>I asked them so many questions about what they had seen. 'What happened when your brothers were shot?' 'How many people did you bury?' 'How do you feel now?' When they said the Serbs had forced an old woman into a tent and burned her alive I looked at them doubtfully and asked how they knew she had been alive. Someone from her family had seen it happen, they said.</p> <p>The Nimaris had arrived at what they thought was a safe haven, but I pursued them, and I did so unsparingly. I got on the bus when the driver opened the doors for air. They had stood for hours on that malodorous bus. I felt sorry for them: but not so sorry that I stopped the questions. They had yet to step down to the misery of the camp the British press has taken to calling 'Brazda'. All they had was a bottle of water passed to them through an open window - and my questions. Ferteze, eight months pregnant, caught me glancing at the watch on her wrist when Remzi, her husband, said all the women in the village had been robbed of their jewellery.</p> <p>Earlier that day, Ron Redmond, the baseball-capped spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, stood at the Blace border crossing from Kosovo into Macedonia and said there were new reports of mass rapes and killings from three villages in the Lipljan area: Sllovi, Hallac Evogel and Ribari Evogel. He spoke to the press of bodies being desecrated, eyes being shot out. The way he talked it sounded as if there had been at least a hundred murders and dozens of rapes. When I pressed him on the rapes, asking him to be more precise, he reduced it a bit and said he had heard that five or six teenage girls had been raped and murdered. He had not spoken to any witnesses. 'We have no way of verifying these reports of rape,' he conceded. 'These are among the first that we have heard of at this border.'</p> <p>Other UNHCR officials later told stories of women being tied to the walls of their houses and burned, 24 bodies buried in Kosovo Polje. Another report, again from Sllovi, put the dead at a hundred. Mr and Mrs Nimari were adamant that it was 16. Truth can be scarce at the Blace border and in the camps dotted around Macedonia, but you are not allowed to say that during a war like this, where it may be that bad things are being done on both sides, just as you are not allowed to doubt atrocity.</p> <p>It's as if Nato and its entourage were trying to make up for the witlessness of the past: trying to show that whatever we do, we won't be turning a blind eye. But the simple-minded reporter in me wants to ask a question: is there any real evidence for what is being said? In Macedonia, listening to the stories and the UNHCR accounts, you would find it hard to tell what was hearsay and what was fact. When you looked at the people clinging onto the carrier bags that now held the remnants of their lives, it seemed evident that terrible things had happened to them, that people had been forced to flee their homes and drag themselves to a non-life in another country. Each person arriving at the camps had experienced some kind of trauma, and most are still living it. Many have seen death and other horrors. It is just that there is little to suggest that they have seen it in the ways, and on the scale, that people want to say they have. Most of those who have seen killing have seen one or two shot and the bodies of others.</p> <p>Eye-witnesses to multiple atrocities are very rare and the simple - and not at all simple - truth is that it can often be hard to establish the veracity of the information. One afternoon, the people in charge said there were refugees arriving who talked of sixty or more being killed in one village, fifty in another, but I could not find one eye-witness who actually saw these things happening. Now, they may have happened. But what we have is a situation where Western journalists accept details without question. Almost every day, the world's media, jostling for stories in Macedonia, strain to find figures that may well not exist. In the absence of any testimony, many just report what some agency or other has told them. I stood by as a reporter from BBC World reeled off what Ron Redmond had said, using the words 'hundreds', 'rape' and 'murder' in the same breath. By way of qualification (a fairly meaningless one in the circumstances), he added that the stories had yet to be substantiated. Why, then, had he reported them so keenly in the first place?</p> <p>I found myself wanting to discover the evidence. I was also impatient to find a 'good' story - i.e. a mass atrocity. As each new bus trundled over the border, I told my interpreter to shout through the windows asking if anyone was from the three villages Redmond had mentioned. Did they know anyone, had they seen anything? We went along twenty buses before we found Mr and Mrs Nimari. A transit camp had been set up in the no man's land between the river and the frontier road at Blace. This was where the tens of thousands were trapped in fetid misery before Macedonian officials dispersed them one night to the newly-built camps. Now the place is used to give a night's rest to some of the great many who wait patiently at this border for entry to a country that doesn't want them and to which they really don't want to go.</p> <p>Every 20 minutes, the Macedonian police let around two hundred people clamber down a dirt path to be processed before being admitted into the camp. As they stood in line, I asked whether anyone was from those villages and whether they'd seen anything they wanted to talk about. No one was and no one did. Or at least they didn't want to tell us about it. It seemed that the Nimaris were the only people from Sllovi. I was moved by their fear and passion to believe everything they said.

The officers from ICTY, the verifiers from the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe and researchers from Human Rights Watch are compiling reports of war crimes, which will be used at a later date for any trial at The Hague. Speaking to these people, I found them to be wary of using the hyperbole favoured by reporters and by the UNHCR. They say they have yet to see evidence of atrocities on the scale that they witnessed while working in Bosnia.</p> <p>When I went to see Benedicte Giaever, the co-ordinator for OSCE's field office in Skopje, I saw that she was angered by the behaviour of the media. I squirmed when she said she had heard of a female journalist getting onto a bus to question some refugees. She said almost every journalist who came to see her asked one thing: could she give them a rape victim to interview. She spoke of one woman being 'hunted down' by journalists and having to have her tent moved to shelter her from their intrusions: she had had a breakdown. I wanted at the same time to test the validity of the truths being offered us and to behave decently in the face of what could not be known for sure, and I knew it wasn't possible to do both. Yet I could see that much of this rough treatment of female refugees was a direct consequence of Robin Cook telling the world that there was evidence of rape camps inside Kosovo. 'Young women are being separated from the refugee columns,' he said, 'and forced to undergo systematic rape in an army camp. We have evidence from many refugees who have managed to escape that others were taken to rape camps.'</p> <p>I know of several tabloid reporters who were despatched to Macedonia and Albania with the sole purpose of finding a rape victim. Talking to each other in the bar of Skopje's Hotel Continental we rehearsed the question which has now become notorious: 'Is there anyone here who's been raped and speaks English?' We were aware of the implications of some of our more despicable behaviour. We knew that one woman, raped by Serbian soldiers then forced to leave her country, was traumatised all over again by a journalist looking for a good story. The things you come to know as a journalist do not march in single file. Facts are often renegade.</p> <p>But among the rape victims arriving in Macedonia nobody spoke of anything like the camps the British Foreign Secretary referred to. Benedicte Giaever told me there had been rape, but not systematic and not on a grand scale. The same was true of the killing. 'We don't have big numbers,' she said. 'What we have are consistent small numbers - two here, five there, ten here, seven there.' Unlike the media and the UNHCR, the OSCE works in a slow, methodical way, waiting a few days till the refugees have settled in before they begin to ask questions. 'These people have just arrived and I would say they are still under a lot of stress and tension,' Giaever says. 'In that situation, 5 people can easily turn into 75. It's not that they want to lie but often they are confused. It's not to say it didn't happen. But a story could have moved around from village to village and everyone from that village tells it as if it happened to them.'</p> <p>Another senior OSCE source spoke even more clearly than any of us were inclined to do. He told me he suspected that the Kosovo Liberation Army had been persuading people to talk in bigger numbers, to crank up the horror so that Nato might be persuaded to send ground troops in faster. Robin Cook's rape camp was the same thing, he said: an attempt to get the British public behind the bombing. And wasn't all this a lesson in how propaganda works in modern war? When I came back to London, I went to see the KLA's spokesman and recruiting officer in Golders Green. Dr Pleurat Sejdiu, sitting beside the KLA flag and busts of the Albanian national hero Skenderbeg, said there were indeed rape camps, and that the evidence of mass atrocities was to be found among the refugees in Albania, not in Macedonia. He is in daily contact with the KLA frontline command by satellite phone and has been told of rape camps in Gjakova, Rahovec, Suhareka, Prizren and Skenderaj. 'We know there are concentration camps and women are kept and raped there,' he said. 'I don't think we will get the evidence until we go in with the ground troops. There are a lot of stories confirming it. There are mass executions and mass graves are appearing now. We have reports from our special units moving around Kosovo. And the pertinent question is: where are the young men who have been taken from the refugee columns? I think everything will be proved when Nato troops go in.'</p> <p>In Skopje I had been to see Ben Ward, a researcher for Human Rights Watch, in the flat he is renting (he had found the Hotel Continental too expensive and the behaviour of the reporters too disconcerting): he pored over maps of Kosovo and pointed to villages where he knows incidents have taken place. His information comes from eye-witnesses and is corroborated by the testimony of others. He has noted a very definite scorched-earth policy. But while his latest report details killings and the mutilation of corpses in the villages of Bajnica and Cakaj, he doesn't think there is evidence of mass executions. 'It is very rare for people not to know someone who knows about people being killed. But there doesn't appear to be anything to support allegations of mass killings,' he said. 'It is generally paramilitaries who are responsible. It doesn't seem organised. There appear to be individual acts of sadism rather than anything else. There seems not to be any policy or instruction, but that isn't to say that people have not been given the latitude to kill. However, I don't think at this stage we have anything that adds up to the systematic killing of civilians.'</p> <p>Ward believes that those who stayed longer in Kosovo have been subjected to more violence, that many have been terrorised because they have stayed so long. Many have fled terror but some of those Ward spoke to said they were fleeing the Nato bombs. 'The Serbs didn't touch us until Nato attacked,' a Kosovar told him. One morning I made a two-year-old girl hysterical. I had asked her parents to show me the wound the child suffered when the bullet that killed her grandmother entered her shoulder. I was getting desperate for some kind of truth to hold onto. They pulled up Marigona Azemi's dress and her pink T-shirt and pointed to a worn bandage. She squealed and said it was the 'licia' who shot her, unable to get her small tongue round the Albanian word milicia. Like the majority of those killed or wounded or abused by the Serbs, Marigona was attacked by paramilitaries, a vicious, marauding band. Seven people in her village of Lovc - including her grandmother Nexhmije - were killed.

I feel bad for having made Marigona cry in order to prove to myself that there was truth in her story. (For days, I went to her - pathetically - with dolls and hair bobbles and sweets and orange juice.) But that is not all I feel. Watching the television images and listening to the newscasters thunder about further reports of Serb massacres and of genocide, I feel uneasy about saying that they have very little to go on.

      "bodyText": "Ferteze Nimari had lost two of her brothers and her husband was forced to bury all the dead in one grave. Later, packed into a stifling bus with sixty fellow Kosovars, the couple held onto each other as he clutched a strap suspended from the ceiling. The bus stopped in the Stankovac I refugee camp in Macedonia and they told their story. 'The tank came to our village of Sllovi. The Serb neighbours said not to worry - it was just there to observe us. But by lunchtime the next day a teenage girl lay dead in the street. Then another 15 people were killed. They told us to run into the woods and they started shooting us.' I asked them so many questions about what they had seen. 'What happened when your brothers were shot?' 'How many people did you bury?' 'How do you feel now?' When they said the Serbs had forced an old woman into a tent and burned her alive I looked at them doubtfully and asked how they knew she had been alive. Someone from her family had seen it happen, they said. The Nimaris had arrived at what they thought was a safe haven, but I pursued them, and I did so unsparingly. I got on the bus when the driver opened the doors for air. They had stood for hours on that malodorous bus. I felt sorry for them: but not so sorry that I stopped the questions. They had yet to step down to the misery of the camp the British press has taken to calling 'Brazda'. All they had was a bottle of water passed to them through an open window - and my questions. Ferteze, eight months pregnant, caught me glancing at the watch on her wrist when Remzi, her husband, said all the women in the village had been robbed of their jewellery. Earlier that day, Ron Redmond, the baseball-capped spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, stood at the Blace border crossing from Kosovo into Macedonia and said there were new reports of mass rapes and killings from three villages in the Lipljan area: Sllovi, Hallac Evogel and Ribari Evogel. He spoke to the press of bodies being desecrated, eyes being shot out. The way he talked it sounded as if there had been at least a hundred murders and dozens of rapes. When I pressed him on the rapes, asking him to be more precise, he reduced it a bit and said he had heard that five or six teenage girls had been raped and murdered. He had not spoken to any witnesses. 'We have no way of verifying these reports of rape,' he conceded. 'These are among the first that we have heard of at this border.' Other UNHCR officials later told stories of women being tied to the walls of their houses and burned, 24 bodies buried in Kosovo Polje. Another report, again from Sllovi, put the dead at a hundred. Mr and Mrs Nimari were adamant that it was 16. Truth can be scarce at the Blace border and in the camps dotted around Macedonia, but you are not allowed to say that during a war like this, where it may be that bad things are being done on both sides, just as you are not allowed to doubt atrocity. It's as if Nato and its entourage were trying to make up for the witlessness of the past: trying to show that whatever we do, we won't be turning a blind eye. But the simple-minded reporter in me wants to ask a question: is there any real evidence for what is being said? In Macedonia, listening to the stories and the UNHCR accounts, you would find it hard to tell what was hearsay and what was fact. When you looked at the people clinging onto the carrier bags that now held the remnants of their lives, it seemed evident that terrible things had happened to them, that people had been forced to flee their homes and drag themselves to a non-life in another country. Each person arriving at the camps had experienced some kind of trauma, and most are still living it. Many have seen death and other horrors. It is just that there is little to suggest that they have seen it in the ways, and on the scale, that people want to say they have. Most of those who have seen killing have seen one or two shot and the bodies of others. Eye-witnesses to multiple atrocities are very rare and the simple - and not at all simple - truth is that it can often be hard to establish the veracity of the information. One afternoon, the people in charge said there were refugees arriving who talked of sixty or more being killed in one village, fifty in another, but I could not find one eye-witness who actually saw these things happening. Now, they may have happened. But what we have is a situation where Western journalists accept details without question. Almost every day, the world's media, jostling for stories in Macedonia, strain to find figures that may well not exist. In the absence of any testimony, many just report what some agency or other has told them. I stood by as a reporter from BBC World reeled off what Ron Redmond had said, using the words 'hundreds', 'rape' and 'murder' in the same breath. By way of qualification (a fairly meaningless one in the circumstances), he added that the stories had yet to be substantiated. Why, then, had he reported them so keenly in the first place? I found myself wanting to discover the evidence. I was also impatient to find a 'good' story - i.e. a mass atrocity. As each new bus trundled over the border, I told my interpreter to shout through the windows asking if anyone was from the three villages Redmond had mentioned. Did they know anyone, had they seen anything? We went along twenty buses before we found Mr and Mrs Nimari. A transit camp had been set up in the no man's land between the river and the frontier road at Blace. This was where the tens of thousands were trapped in fetid misery before Macedonian officials dispersed them one night to the newly-built camps. Now the place is used to give a night's rest to some of the great many who wait patiently at this border for entry to a country that doesn't want them and to which they really don't want to go. Every 20 minutes, the Macedonian police let around two hundred people clamber down a dirt path to be processed before being admitted into the camp. As they stood in line, I asked whether anyone was from those villages and whether they'd seen anything they wanted to talk about. No one was and no one did. Or at least they didn't want to tell us about it. It seemed that the Nimaris were the only people from Sllovi. I was moved by their fear and passion to believe everything they said. Remzi told me he'd buried the dead in a grave in the woods at Lugi i Demes. It will take the verifiers from the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague to put our agitated, agitating minds at rest. The officers from ICTY, the verifiers from the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe and researchers from Human Rights Watch are compiling reports of war crimes, which will be used at a later date for any trial at The Hague. Speaking to these people, I found them to be wary of using the hyperbole favoured by reporters and by the UNHCR. They say they have yet to see evidence of atrocities on the scale that they witnessed while working in Bosnia.

      "bodyText": "Len Clarke writes: In his very good obituary (August 12) of Constance Babington Smith, Dan van der Vat comments (of the Me262 in 1943) that \"the Germans, too, had (by then) advanced to a twin-engined jet.\" In fact, two years earlier, in April 1941, the twin-engined Heinkel He.280 had flown - six weeks before Whittle's single-engined experimental Gloster E28/39. Although dogged by development problems, in 1941 it successfully outflew the Luftwaffe's excellent FW.190 in trials. If it had reached full-scale production, the effect on the RAF and USAAF in the crucial middle stages of the war would have been devastating. Margaret Coyne writes: When I was a young WAAF serving at headquarters Bomber Command 60 years ago, \"Babs\" Babington Smith, as we knew her, arrived. She obviously moved on rather quickly to become a section officer. How many who know her are left out there I wonder? I would love to hear from anyone who shares my memories of that time.",
