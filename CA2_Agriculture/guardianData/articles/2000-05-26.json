      "body": "<p>Put yourself in this position: you come home to find your house has been burgled (again) and the television and video stolen. You have a pretty good idea who's responsible. You're a law-abiding citizen, all you want is your property back and to feel secure in your own home. But this home happens to be in Ardoyne in north Belfast, a strongly republican area, and one of your neighbours suggests you go to the IRA. You're fed up, you want something done, but you don't approve of punishment beatings.</p> <p>What do you do? The obvious course is to go to the police, to the RUC. Not an easy decision. Here are some things you will be thinking of as you mull over your predicament.</p> <p>You will be aware, for example, of the slaughter that took place in Kinnaird Terrace, a mile or so away, and which has come down to you as folk memory. One March night in 1922, at a time of bitter IRA and loyalist fighting, a band of masked policemen led by John Nixon, a district inspector in the RIC (shortly to be reorganised as the RUC), sledgehammered their way into the house of Owen McMahon, a prosperous Catholic publican, moderately nationalist in politics. The policemen roused the family from their beds and herded the men into the parlour, where Nixon ordered McMahon, his five sons and his bar manager, Edward McKinney, to say their prayers. Then the policemen opened fire. When the shooting stopped, McKinney, McMahon and three of his sons were dead; two others were seriously wounded.</p> <p>A few days later, Nixon visited Arnon Street with some of his men. Here they found a Catholic man, Joseph Walsh, in bed with his seven-year-old son Michael and two-year-old daughter Brigid. Dragging Walsh from the bed, they smashed his head in with a sledgehammer. They then shot the two children, killing the boy. Before leaving, they also shot 14-year-old Frank Walsh.</p> <p>There's much more - Nixon's men using bayonets to finish the job, murdering a Catholic policeman - but none of it led to Nixon's arrest, though his activities were known to both Lloyd George and Churchill. Nixon remained a policeman, helped found the Sir Robert Peel Memorial Orange Lodge, was later elected to Stormont as an independent Unionist MP, and went on to be awarded an MBE. As Catholics at the time were not slow to grasp, the murder gangs were intent on terrorising the Catholic population into political quiescence and acceptance of the newly created state.</p> <p>There are those who say there is too much history in Ireland, too much remembering and casting up of the past. But the point about the Nixon murders of 80 years ago is that they established what turned out to be a consistent pattern. And they serve to illustrate that the overwhelmingly Protestant RUC was, from the moment of its creation, whether acting illegally or otherwise, understood by Catholics and Protestants, nationalists and unionists, as existing to serve the interests of the ruling party.</p> <p>The RUC acted as the Unionist party's enforcers when, in 1964, it used water cannon and batons to snatch a tricolour from the election offices of a republican candidate in Divis, sparking the worst riots Belfast had seen for many years. It was acting in the same spirit in 1968 when in Derry, in front of the world's cameras, it beat civil rights marchers - protesting about the abuses of the Unionist-run Derry city council - off the streets with such violence that it triggered the outbreak of the Troubles. When Unionists express outrage at the proposed reform of the RUC, it looks very much to non-Unionists as if they are doing so because they see the RUC as theirs.</p> <p>It is a point made by Max Hastings, no lover of Irish republicanism, who recalls in his recently published memoirs being in Belfast in August 1969 and is explicit in attributing to the RUC the deaths of innocent Catholic civilians during the loyalist attack on the Falls Road. He asks the obvious question: how do you expect Catholics to trust a force which was responsible for machine-gunning their co-religionists?</p> <p>Or for killing children with plastic bullets? Or for colluding with loyalist assassins? Or for brutalising prisoners in the infamous interrogation centre at Castlereagh? Or - in a less dramatic, everyday kind of incident - for beating up a Catholic teenager outside a chip shop, falsely arresting him, throwing him in a van and calling him a \"fenian bastard\" (the RUC officer in this case was, unusually, sent to prison a few weeks ago)?</p> <p>It would take much more than the space available here to complete the indictment of the RUC. But let's consider one more count, chillingly reminiscent of the activities of Nixon. In the 80s, in the vicious sectarian murder triangle of mid-Ulster, a serving RUC sergeant who was also a member of the UVF, the loyalist paramilitary group responsible for hundreds of sectarian murders, called at the shop of a local Catholic, like Owen McMahon unconnected with the IRA, and shot him dead. The sergeant was not alone. Six of the 10-strong special RUC squad based in Armagh of which he was a member were later arrested and convicted of assassinating Catholics and carrying out bombing attacks on Catholic homes and property.</p> <p>The present RUC chief constable, Sir Ronnie Flanagan, routinely dismisses allegations of anti-Catholic, anti-nationalist prejudice in his force by insisting that such episodes are neither \"tolerated\" nor \"systemic\". But if, say, half a dozen white Metropolitan police officers had been convicted of moonlighting as racist assassins; if others were handing over weapons to white supremacist murderers in order to kill black people; if yet more were passing on confidential information about prominent members of the black community - their movements, their cars, their telephone numbers, their addresses - and this information was then used to kill them; if they conspired to pervert the course of justice by destroying evidence of their activities; if they had fired plastic bullets that resulted in the killing and maiming of black children on the streets of London; and if all of this had gone on for over 30 years, would the Metropolitan commissioner dare to make a statement as palpably risible as Flanagan's? Would his force have gone unreformed for so long?</p> <p>There are many who thought Chris Patten's report on the future of policing did not go far enough, and that the case for disbanding the RUC and starting afresh was unanswerable. But, for the sake of something more important, they reluctantly went along with Patten's recommendations, only to see them watered down by Peter Mandelson. If the Unionists succeed in minimising reform, the party may have reason to feel pleased, but it will be to the ultimate detriment of the north. All it will have achieved is the alienation of our burglary victim. Until he can go to the police, the law and order vacuum will continue to be filled by the men with baseball bats and pistols.</p> <p>\u0095 Ronan Bennett is author of His Rebel Heart, a four-part drama set in Ireland between 1916 and 1922 to be screened on BBC1 later this year</p>",

      "body": "<p>At a time when technology has dominated the media and set the stock market spinning, the Prime Minister has set up a team to define the role of government in the e-commerce revolution. I offer here thoughts on the approach. My website sets out the action in more detail. </p> <p>E-commerce. E-business. E-government. Even an E-Envoy! The fifth letter of the alphabet seems to be springing up in front of everything. The original stock market euphoria for dot.coms caught the public imagination. Tiny start-ups bursting with energy and ideas and finding new ways of meeting consumer needs sparked enthusiasm for a \"new economy\". </p> <p>But as the shine fades from dot.com stocks, many are asking whether it has all been just another South Sea Bubble about to burst. There is no doubt that we are still in the first flush of a new gold rush. Many of the valuations we have seen over recent months have been highly speculative, and the events of recent days are a healthy correction. </p> <p>Though I, for one, am convinced that the fundamental premise remains true: the internet is capable of driving wealth creation on a scale, and at a pace, unprecedented by previous technological advances. </p> <p>It is clear that the internet is not just the preserve of the so-called new economy. It is transforming business across the entire economy: driving cost out of supply chains, lowering barriers to entry, giving smallest firms the sort of global reach previously enjoyed only by the largest. This is what we need to hold on to when the stock markets finally settle. And this is where the government fits in. </p> <p>What does e mean for government? It wants the UK to be the best place in the world for e-commerce; 2002 is the target date for this; to create an environment in which British businesses and consumers can seize the opportunities which e-commerce is opening up and to make today's prediliction for the letter e a quaint reminder of the time when the internet was not embedded in every aspect of British life. </p> <p>But what role can government hope to play in the face of such rapid change? Although it may be too early to predict the final shape of our future environment, we can start demonstrating the opportunities, tackling the problems and moulding our new environment. </p> <p>There is a key role for government to play here. Not trying to second-guess market and technological developments, but helping ensure everyone benefits fully and fast. </p> <p>I see three sides to this role: markets, people and government. First, markets. Setting the legal and regulatory framework in which businesses and consumers operate is government's traditional role. It remains so in the e-commerce world. But we face new challenges which mean many of the old approaches need rethinking. The pace of change is relentless, so we need light-touch, flexible approaches, encouraging industry to develop effective self-regulation. We need to build global, not national solutions. Rules which might have made sense in the off-line world may be nonsense in cyberspace - so we need to uproot barriers to e-commerce, as we are doing through our Electronic Communications Bill. </p> <p>Second, helping people get ready for the latest technologies - giving everyone, access to the skills they need to make a success of new opportunities. The Prime Minister has committed the government to achieving universal access to the internet for all by 2005. That is why the government is wiring up all schools and libraries and building Information and Communication Technology Learning Centres to give everyone access to free taster sessions, and launching the University for Industry. </p> <p>We are helping businesses get on-line too. There is the Small Business Service online portal offering advice and support and in his latest Budget the chancellor announced a \u00a360m package of support to help SMEs get on line, alongside new capital tax allowances for investment by small enterprises in Information and Communication Technologies. And we are working with industry on a long-term strategy to ensure that the skill needs of the technology supply sector itself are met, including relaxing visa restrictions on skilled IT professionals to help counter skills shortages. </p> <p>Finally, we are reforming the way government conducts its business. New technologies mean government services can be delivered to those affected, immediately and efficiently. We are working hard to take advantage of this. The e-Government Strategy, published last month, sets out how government services will all be conveniently available online.</p> <p><strong>Links:</strong><br> e-Envoy site: <a href=\"http://www.e-envoy.gov.uk/\">www.e-envoy.gov.uk/</a><br>University for Industry <a href=\"http://www.ufiltd.co.uk/\">www.ufiltd.co.uk/</a><br>Small Business Online: <a href=\"http://www.business.dfee.gov.uk\">www.business.dfee.gov.uk</a></p>",

Though I, for one, am convinced that the fundamental premise remains true: the internet is capable of driving wealth creation on a scale, and at a pace, unprecedented by previous technological advances. It is clear that the internet is not just the preserve of the so-called new economy. It is transforming business across the entire economy: driving cost out of supply chains, lowering barriers to entry, giving smallest firms the sort of global reach previously enjoyed only by the largest. This is what we need to hold on to when the stock markets finally settle. And this is where the government fits in. What does e mean for government? It wants the UK to be the best place in the world for e-commerce; 2002 is the target date for this; to create an environment in which British businesses and consumers can seize the opportunities which e-commerce is opening up and to make today's prediliction for the letter e a quaint reminder of the time when the internet was not embedded in every aspect of British life. But what role can government hope to play in the face of such rapid change? Although it may be too early to predict the final shape of our future environment, we can start demonstrating the opportunities, tackling the problems and moulding our new environment. There is a key role for government to play here. Not trying to second-guess market and technological developments, but helping ensure everyone benefits fully and fast. I see three sides to this role: markets, people and government. First, markets. Setting the legal and regulatory framework in which businesses and consumers operate is government's traditional role. It remains so in the e-commerce world. But we face new challenges which mean many of the old approaches need rethinking. The pace of change is relentless, so we need light-touch, flexible approaches, encouraging industry to develop effective self-regulation. We need to build global, not national solutions. Rules which might have made sense in the off-line world may be nonsense in cyberspace - so we need to uproot barriers to e-commerce, as we are doing through our Electronic Communications Bill. Second, helping people get ready for the latest technologies - giving everyone, access to the skills they need to make a success of new opportunities. The Prime Minister has committed the government to achieving universal access to the internet for all by 2005. That is why the government is wiring up all schools and libraries and building Information and Communication Technology Learning Centres to give everyone access to free taster sessions, and launching the University for Industry. We are helping businesses get on-line too. There is the Small Business Service online portal offering advice and support and in his latest Budget the chancellor announced a \u00a360m package of support to help SMEs get on line, alongside new capital tax allowances for investment by small enterprises in Information and Communication Technologies. And we are working with industry on a long-term strategy to ensure that the skill needs of the technology supply sector itself are met, including relaxing visa restrictions on skilled IT professionals to help counter skills shortages. Finally, we are reforming the way government conducts its business. New technologies mean government services can be delivered to those affected, immediately and efficiently. We are working hard to take advantage of this. The e-Government Strategy, published last month, sets out how government services will all be conveniently available online.

Hours later, the Scottish insurer fired off a six-page statement rebutting the claims by Fred Woollard, the Australia-born, Monaco-based leader of the rebels. </p> <p>It's quite clear there will be plenty more harsh words exchanged before the result of the vote is announced on June 27. For some policyholders, this will probably be irrelevant - they've already made up their minds. But what about those who have yet to decide which way they will vote? In order to help them, here we attempt to pick through some of the arguments put by the two sides. </p> <p>The most hotly debated aspect of the row is, of course, windfalls, and what they might be worth. Mr Woollard claims the flotation of the company could see it valued at \u00a312bn-\u00a315bn, which he says would spell average payouts of \u00a35,000-\u00a36,300 to qualifying with-profits policyholders. </p> <p>Standard Life says that, assuming a flotation value of \u00a312bn and a minimum payout of \u00a3250, a 26% of policyholders could be looking at windfalls of \u00a3250-\u00a31,000, another 24% might get \u00a31,000-\u00a32,500, while 30% could receive \u00a32,500-\u00a36,000. Around 256,000 policyholders (11%) might get \u00a36,000-\u00a310,000, another 200,000 (9%) could receive \u00a310,000-\u00a399,999, with a lucky 2,000 policyholders set for \u00a3100,000-plus each. </p> <p>In truth, no one can say for sure what the payouts would be worth. There are a number of different ways Standard Life could decide to divide up the cash and the company is right when it says the actual amounts would depend on its market value, which in turn would depend on stock market conditions at the time of the float. </p> <p>However, many commentators say Standard Life has gone for a very conservative potential flotation value. Ned Cazalet, a respected independent life insurance analyst, believes the company is likely to be worth around \u00a316bn, and predicts average windfalls of \u00a37,000 - even higher than Mr Woollard is forecasting. </p> <p>But it's fair to say that quoting an average windfall figure of any size is misleading because any payouts are likely to vary wildly, from a few hundred pounds to six-figure sums depending on the type of policy, its size and how long it has been held for. </p> <p>So how will the vote go? Well, we can assume that a sizeable chunk of the policyholders - probably at least half - will vote to take the cash. However, the rebels face a substantial challenge in getting 75% of policyholders to vote for demutualisation (the amount needed for the proposal to succeed). </p> <p>Some observers say the most likely result is a vote of between 50% and 75% for demutualisation. This could be the worst result of all for Standard Life's boardmembers: technically they would have won, but this would be a very hollow victory as it means the majority of policyholders voted against them. </p> <p>It's hard to disagree with Mr Woollard's assertion that a result of, say, 66% would put the board in a very awkward position and leave the company vulnerable to a takeover bid from a predator. However, for the policyholders, a takeover battle could be great news as it would drive up the potential windfalls. </p> <p>One of the other crucial areas is to what extent policyholders would be affected by a demutualisation because of the need to pay dividends to shareholders. Mr Woollard seized on remarks made by Standard Life group managing director Scott Bell in an interview which quoted him saying that \"existing policyholders would not lose out [from demutualisation]\". Mr Woollard says this shows that no existing policyholder will suffer, and adds there are legal procedures in place to ensure this is the case. </p> <p>But Standard Life says this is wrong. While steps are taken to protect existing policies from future bonus reductions caused by the need to pay dividends to shareholders, people who increase their pension contributions could be worse off, as would anyone taking out a new policy. </p> <p>\u0095 Standard Life's website: <a href=\"http://www.standardlife.com\">www.standardlife.com</a>.

      "body": "<p>A new form of motor insurance fraud, involving staged and contrived car accidents plus multiple personal injury claims, is sweeping the UK after swamping US insurers over the past few years. </p> <p>Some major insurers and investigators now speak openly of systematic criminal activity and corruption, but admit that they are almost powerless to prevent paying out millions of pounds even to known fraudsters. </p> <p>This week Direct Line, the UK's biggest motor insurer, broke ranks with other insurers which prefer to pretend' that sophisticated computer systems and information sharing is beating the fraudsters. Bill Trueman, who runs Direct Line's anti-fraud division, says the industry is wide open to fraud. \"The industry shares hardly any data. Where they do, it's on an ad hoc basis. The Association of British Insurers says the total fraud figure is around \u00a3650m a year, but I believe it is much higher than that.\" His own estimate of how much Direct Line pays out every year on fraudulent claims is \"anywhere between \u00a340m to \u00a370m\". </p> <p>This is not a \"victimless\" crime.

      "bodyText": "A new form of motor insurance fraud, involving staged and contrived car accidents plus multiple personal injury claims, is sweeping the UK after swamping US insurers over the past few years. Some major insurers and investigators now speak openly of systematic criminal activity and corruption, but admit that they are almost powerless to prevent paying out millions of pounds even to known fraudsters. This week Direct Line, the UK's biggest motor insurer, broke ranks with other insurers which prefer to pretend' that sophisticated computer systems and information sharing is beating the fraudsters. Bill Trueman, who runs Direct Line's anti-fraud division, says the industry is wide open to fraud. \"The industry shares hardly any data. Where they do, it's on an ad hoc basis. The Association of British Insurers says the total fraud figure is around \u00a3650m a year, but I believe it is much higher than that.\" His own estimate of how much Direct Line pays out every year on fraudulent claims is \"anywhere between \u00a340m to \u00a370m\". This is not a \"victimless\" crime. On a \u00a3400 motor insurance premium, it can add up to as much as \u00a330-\u00a340. Fake claims for staged and contrived motor accidents began in the US and have, in recent years, spread across the Atlantic.

      "body": "<p>Leslie Kinsey agreed with barely a thought when asked if she would help an undergraduate restore a white paint-covered gilded table. </p> <p>Nine months later, two days before last Christmas, as she touched the last of the gilding, she realised: \"The table hijacked my life.\" She had spent the summer and winter terms and holidays on it at London Guildhall University, where she is a technician, working every free moment, 8am to 8.30pm. She felt that she had abandoned the two of her four children who still lived at home. </p> <p>The table, now gleamingly restored to the entrance hall at Firle Place, Sussex, an independent stately home and ancestral home of owners the Gage family, repays her by its beauty, she says. That it revealed itself under the paint as a rare piece of 18th century craftsmanship worth around \u00a3400,000, is irrelevant. What matters is fulfilling a passion for restoration that she discovered after she left her first career, nursing. </p> <p>It was this passion that took her into freelance restoration, brought her to London Guildhall and persuaded her to work tirelessly building the link between her university and the Worshipful Company of Painter Stainers, the ancient City of London craft guild that resulted in a Millennium Saloon exhibition in February. </p> <p>The undergraduate student who brought her the Firle table, Paul Cadman, a former broker, had written to Lord Gage after visiting Firle, which, he said, felt lived in, unlike more pristine National Trust-run houses. He asked to borrow a piece as his degree project. </p> <p>Lord Gage's art dealer cousin, Deborah Gage, offered a selection. \"I had a feeling about this table but I had no idea just how good it was,\" she says. It had been painted over in the 30s, probably after the carving was damaged. As the paint came off Cadman realised he had a project too big to handle alone. Miss Gage went hunting for provenance. </p> <p>The Gage family had lived in Arlington Street, Piccadilly, in the 18th century and she thought the table had been commissioned for that house. She asked experts from Christie's and the Royal Collection for advice. So far no certain attribution has been made but a similar table is in the Royal Collection. </p> <p>Ms Kinsey, called in to help, felt that there would be little gilding left, but, unusually, the gilding was water-and not oil-based and much was intact. \"It would have been quicker and cheaper if it had all come off. But when we realised how much was there I tried to consolidate.\" </p> <p>\"This was such a stunning piece it just consumed me. I went right to the wood and worked out. I tried to find the right colour gold. I bought six different colours, then I found it, Rose Noble.\" Each day would start with speculation over breakfast. The table had last been worked on 250 years earlier. What had that craftsman eaten? </p> <p>She started her career as a nurse in her native Cape Town. She considered art school but \"all my family were medics\". She followed her boyfriend to London, married and started private nursing. \"It was so disheartening. I was on relief so I did not get to know my patients.\" Then she saw an advert for \"somebody with a knowledge of interior design\" to design open-plan offices. She only had an A level in renaissance art but applied. The firm interviewed 23 architects, then appointed and trained her. It was five years before wanderlust struck again. </p> <p>She started a degree at Surrey University, but four months from the end she had a baby, \"an unexpected and happy surprise\". Her second son arrived within 17 months. Turning her talent into producing Montessori toys, she ran a thriving business from her kitchen table until the kids were grown up. In 1989 she decided to formalise her skills and enrolled on a conservation and restoration course at De Montfort University. She established a reputation. \"After I qualified dealers kept on giving me work. I had a nice business.\" Then she saw the London job advertised. She went to London Guildhall. She prefers being a technician because a lecturer spends one hour with students where she spends three. </p> <p>She still runs a freelance business and her ambitions now include a working retirement. \"I want to build an eco house and grow organic carrots. There is painting I would like to do. I would like to learn to carve and, of course, carry on gilding.\"</p>",

The table, now gleamingly restored to the entrance hall at Firle Place, Sussex, an independent stately home and ancestral home of owners the Gage family, repays her by its beauty, she says. That it revealed itself under the paint as a rare piece of 18th century craftsmanship worth around \u00a3400,000, is irrelevant. What matters is fulfilling a passion for restoration that she discovered after she left her first career, nursing. It was this passion that took her into freelance restoration, brought her to London Guildhall and persuaded her to work tirelessly building the link between her university and the Worshipful Company of Painter Stainers, the ancient City of London craft guild that resulted in a Millennium Saloon exhibition in February. The undergraduate student who brought her the Firle table, Paul Cadman, a former broker, had written to Lord Gage after visiting Firle, which, he said, felt lived in, unlike more pristine National Trust-run houses. He asked to borrow a piece as his degree project. Lord Gage's art dealer cousin, Deborah Gage, offered a selection. \"I had a feeling about this table but I had no idea just how good it was,\" she says. It had been painted over in the 30s, probably after the carving was damaged. As the paint came off Cadman realised he had a project too big to handle alone. Miss Gage went hunting for provenance. The Gage family had lived in Arlington Street, Piccadilly, in the 18th century and she thought the table had been commissioned for that house. She asked experts from Christie's and the Royal Collection for advice. So far no certain attribution has been made but a similar table is in the Royal Collection. Ms Kinsey, called in to help, felt that there would be little gilding left, but, unusually, the gilding was water-and not oil-based and much was intact. \"It would have been quicker and cheaper if it had all come off. But when we realised how much was there I tried to consolidate.\" \"This was such a stunning piece it just consumed me. I went right to the wood and worked out. I tried to find the right colour gold. I bought six different colours, then I found it, Rose Noble.\" Each day would start with speculation over breakfast. The table had last been worked on 250 years earlier. What had that craftsman eaten? She started her career as a nurse in her native Cape Town. She considered art school but \"all my family were medics\". She followed her boyfriend to London, married and started private nursing. \"It was so disheartening. I was on relief so I did not get to know my patients.\" Then she saw an advert for \"somebody with a knowledge of interior design\" to design open-plan offices. She only had an A level in renaissance art but applied. The firm interviewed 23 architects, then appointed and trained her. It was five years before wanderlust struck again. She started a degree at Surrey University, but four months from the end she had a baby, \"an unexpected and happy surprise\". Her second son arrived within 17 months. Turning her talent into producing Montessori toys, she ran a thriving business from her kitchen table until the kids were grown up. In 1989 she decided to formalise her skills and enrolled on a conservation and restoration course at De Montfort University. She established a reputation. \"After I qualified dealers kept on giving me work. I had a nice business.\" Then she saw the London job advertised. She went to London Guildhall. She prefers being a technician because a lecturer spends one hour with students where she spends three. She still runs a freelance business and her ambitions now include a working retirement. \"I want to build an eco house and grow organic carrots. There is painting I would like to do. I would like to learn to carve and, of course, carry on gilding.\"",

While his clients want to save money, Ray Woolford, sales director of Housemartins estate agents, says: \"Sellers are earning so much from London homes that estate agents fees (he charges 2%) are almost immaterial.\" Instead, what Mr Woolford's customers want is service. Something that Housemartins, which bills itself as London's only gay estate agency, believes it can offer. The company has three of fices covering homes in Docklands, south and central London.

Gay buyers and sellers need agents sensitive to their needs. \"Gay clients are often interested in more unusual properties, that might otherwise be hard to sell.\" </p> <p>Mr White predicts that tailor-made estate agency will grow.

Flexible work patterns of 15, 25 or 35 hours a week are offered with pay ranging from \u00a34.50 to \u00a37.20 an hour, plus the prospect of higher rates and promotion for those with a burning talent for teasing out our views. </p> <p>\"It's a job that offers unique variety and challenges and can be tremendously satisfying,\" says Gallup's Dominic James, who is handling the latest batch of recruitment. \"It requires patience, persistence and persuasion to obtain the opinions of people on topics ranging from politics to brand awareness when they would probably much rather be doing something else such as enjoying a cup of tea or watching TV.\" </p> <p>So what is the magic form of words that can persuade a committed fan of Coronation Street or The Bill to switch off their favourite soap in order to be quizzed on the merits or otherwise of New Labour or a particular brand of coffee or car? </p> <p>\"The key is empathy,\" says Mr James. \"The approach must be based on the understanding that no one is obliged to give their views and sensing that, even if they are willing, it might be an inconvenient time for them to do so.

We will base our decision on the minutiae of the report\". </p> <p>Rehman told an earlier inquiry that Wasim gave him \u00a31,100 to bowl badly in a one-day match in Christchurch in 1994. He maintained to the Qayyum commisssion that he changed his story under coercion after Wasim paid for his air ticket from Newcastle to Manchester: a ticket which Wasim's counsel accepted was paid for on Wasim's credit card. </p> <p>But Rehman was recalled for cross-examination last September and categorically stated that he had lied to the commission. He was immediately issued with a notice for perjury. In a third appearance before the commisssion, he said he had been induced by team-mate Aamir Sohail to give evidence against Wasim. </p> <p>Lord MacLaurin, the ECB chairman, said yesterday that the International Cricket Council had the power to press the Pakistan Cricket Board to increase the punishments on their players. \"Watch this space, because this is not the end of it,\" he said. But the PCB director, Yawar Saeed, said he did not fear further sanctions. </p> <p>Australia have appointed Greg Melick, a lawyer and former part-time army commando, as the country's first anti-corruption watchdog.

The official line from Channel 4 was that \"no snap decision will be made. We will base our decision on the minutiae of the report\". Rehman told an earlier inquiry that Wasim gave him \u00a31,100 to bowl badly in a one-day match in Christchurch in 1994. He maintained to the Qayyum commisssion that he changed his story under coercion after Wasim paid for his air ticket from Newcastle to Manchester: a ticket which Wasim's counsel accepted was paid for on Wasim's credit card. But Rehman was recalled for cross-examination last September and categorically stated that he had lied to the commission. He was immediately issued with a notice for perjury. In a third appearance before the commisssion, he said he had been induced by team-mate Aamir Sohail to give evidence against Wasim. Lord MacLaurin, the ECB chairman, said yesterday that the International Cricket Council had the power to press the Pakistan Cricket Board to increase the punishments on their players. \"Watch this space, because this is not the end of it,\" he said. But the PCB director, Yawar Saeed, said he did not fear further sanctions. Australia have appointed Greg Melick, a lawyer and former part-time army commando, as the country's first anti-corruption watchdog. He has been given sweeping powers to investigate claims of corruption and match-fixing.",

      "body": "<p>Even a member of that mythical species, the completely tone deaf, could not fail to be stirred by a Joanna MacGregor performance. Simply to see her zipping around a keyboard grabbing fistfuls of notes at the behest of some unfeasible contemporary score is to watch a pianist pushing the human frame to its limits. </p> <p>But even her dazzling virtuosity was not enough to wow one small boy at a recent concert she gave for kids. Like the rest of the audience, he had been cascaded with bits and bobs of pieces in every style from her vast repertoire of classical, jazz, ragtime, blues, techno, African etc. He'd coolly watched her dive under the lid of the concert grand to pluck the wires - normally a surefire knockout for kids. Then as she drew breath and invited questions, he piped up: </p> <p>\"Can you play Match of the Day?\" </p> <p>How many veterans of the Wigmore Hall platform would be floored by such a request? For Joanna MacGregor, though, it was simply a hoot. \"In his eyes, until I played Match of the Day, I hadn't passed the test. I wasn't a proper pianist.\" Needless to say, she sailed through and doubtless logged the experience for her next children's recital. </p> <p>MacGregor is rare among top-flight concert pianists, for the interest she takes in how small children learn the instrument. She has just published her own piano tutor for children: Joanna MacGregor's PianoWorld. And she has managed it despite a crippling work schedule. This week, for instance, she was giving a lecture in London as Gresham professor of music. Then she was straight off to Bath for the first of three concerts at its festival - a recital that included a fiendishly hard piano transcription of Stravinsky's ballet Petrushka. </p> <p>There hardly seems to be a festival this summer which she is not gracing. Tomorrow, as artistic director of the Society for the Promotion of New Music, she is in the thick of an all-day collaboration between nine young composers and artists at the Tate Gallery, Liverpool. She runs her own recording label: SoundCircus. And by her own admission she cannot meet an artist of any sort without being tempted to suggest a joint project. So, why on earth take on the extra burden of writing a book? </p> <p>\"Everyone asks me this. People are clearly surprised that I would concern myself with the very first lessons. It says a lot about the music profession that we tend to concentrate on the top end, on the BBC Young Musician competition, on this idea of the child as a nascent virtuoso.</p> <p>\"Most people's interest in music is much more ordinary and much more everyday. I find that much more interesting.\" </p> <p>In producing the first three books of what she intends to be a continuing series, MacGregor is drawing on vivid experience. Between the age of 18 and 25, before she was getting concert engagements as a pianist, she taught a stream of beginners the piano. But most important in her make-up now as a musician who is unsurpassed in the breadth of her eclectic repertoire, was the endless procession of small boys and girls during the 1960s and 70s traipsing into her childhood home in Willesden, north London, where her mother taught the piano. </p> <p>\"Not only was I fiddling around at the keyboard but there were all these other children of all backgrounds wanting to play every sort of music - bits of classical, jazz, pop, improvisation.\"</p> <p>Until she was 18, she had lessons from her mother, too. \"I wasn't part of that hothouse thing. I didn't go to the Yehudi Menuhin school. I grew up with the idea of trying to make music available to people of all abilities.\" </p> <p>Just as everyone should be able to learn how to swim, or to speak a smattering of French, so, in her view should everybody be able to make a stab at learning the piano. Some kids have a flair and make rapid progress. Such kids, she says, can take care of themselves. She is fascinated by the others: those who chug along at varying rates of progress, enjoying it for a while, but all too often giving up. </p> <p>This falling off happens at any stage. Some kids find the beginning too frustrating. Others rebel at parental pressure driving them to \"be like those children on the telly\". A fair proportion bow out at Grade 5, the peak of the foothills, after which the going gets distinctly tougher. </p> <p>\"I worry that some people use music, like sport, as a way of making their children achieve things, rather than just saying: it's music, it's there to enjoy. I don't want to sound woolly, but the reason children fall by the wayside is because they feel they are not going to match up to their parents' high expectations.\" </p> <p>The production of her own training manuals begs an obvious question. Does she have a poor opinion of the existing corpus of tutor books, or indeed of the general quality of piano teaching? \"I'm very reluctant to criticise other people's teaching or others' tutor books,\" she says, shutting that avenue for discussion. What she does do is readily accept that her books, colourful and eye-catching though they are, are by no means the only books on the market designed to make the early years enjoyable. </p> <p>Her wheeze for luring the fives, sixes and sevens through those bewildering early months is to weave a storyline into the books and their accompanying CDs, right from the that first fumbling for middle C. Ned, a crepe-soled rocker with an extravagant quiff, and Grumper, a cat in cool shades, live on top of an old upright piano. A note, signed Scherzo Sisters, arrives: \"PianoWorld needs help today, Silent pianos get thrown away. To save the piano complete our tasks, That's all the Scherzo Sisters ask.\" </p> <p>And so the odyssey begins. First task. Find the Cs - \"they're always to the left of the two black keys\". The challenge at this fragile stage is to make the work interesting. </p> <p>\"Kids want something that sounds exciting and good, even if they're playing just one note.\" And so, from lesson one, there are accompaniments in a variety of styles for teacher - or parent - to play beneath the child's line. For kids whose parents aren't pianists, the accompaniments are recorded on the CDs. </p> <p>For five to seven year olds, learning the piano should be unadulterated fun, MacGregor insists. \"You have to allow them to improvise and give them a reason to play at either end of the keyboard and on the black notes and use the pedals.\" </p> <p>In Book 2, the characters fall inside the piano and open up opportunities for making a whole lot of weird noises. As progress is made, bigger obstacles loom. Children need to be coaxed quite hard to read the music rather than rely on ear. Having relied for so much of her own childhood on her very keen ear, MacGregor has considerable sympathy on this score. </p> <p>But perhaps the biggest problem of all is practice. How can children be persuaded to play a passage even once again, let alone many times over. She admits not having practised rigorously until she went to the Royal Academy of Music, after graduating in music from Cambridge. As a teenager, she had simply played what she liked: hymns at school, keyboard with bands, and lots of Gershwin for dance classes. </p> <p>At the Royal Academy and afterwards she began building up a contemporary repertoire whose formidable difficulties demanded practice. Now she loves practice. The eight hours a day that she gets through are the core of her musical life, she says, more important than performances.</p> <p>\"I have enormous sympathy with people who find it difficult to practise. I don't think people talk about practice enough.\" </p> <p>The secret of any practice, whether for 20 minutes or five hours, is to work out beforehand exactly what it is you are aiming to do, she says. Other tips: treat yourself - play the whole piece through, however many wrong notes. And mix hard with easy. </p> <p>\"If I'm learning a Birtwistle, and gosh that's hard. It's nice to play a piece by Eric Satie afterwards.\" </p> <p>But Birtwistle must wait for Book 4.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.fabermusic.com/pianoworld\">PianoWorld</a> Books 1-3, published by Faber Music, \u00a34.95 each.</p>",

This week, for instance, she was giving a lecture in London as Gresham professor of music. Then she was straight off to Bath for the first of three concerts at its festival - a recital that included a fiendishly hard piano transcription of Stravinsky's ballet Petrushka. There hardly seems to be a festival this summer which she is not gracing. Tomorrow, as artistic director of the Society for the Promotion of New Music, she is in the thick of an all-day collaboration between nine young composers and artists at the Tate Gallery, Liverpool. She runs her own recording label: SoundCircus. And by her own admission she cannot meet an artist of any sort without being tempted to suggest a joint project. So, why on earth take on the extra burden of writing a book? \"Everyone asks me this. People are clearly surprised that I would concern myself with the very first lessons. It says a lot about the music profession that we tend to concentrate on the top end, on the BBC Young Musician competition, on this idea of the child as a nascent virtuoso. \"Most people's interest in music is much more ordinary and much more everyday. I find that much more interesting.\" In producing the first three books of what she intends to be a continuing series, MacGregor is drawing on vivid experience. Between the age of 18 and 25, before she was getting concert engagements as a pianist, she taught a stream of beginners the piano. But most important in her make-up now as a musician who is unsurpassed in the breadth of her eclectic repertoire, was the endless procession of small boys and girls during the 1960s and 70s traipsing into her childhood home in Willesden, north London, where her mother taught the piano. \"Not only was I fiddling around at the keyboard but there were all these other children of all backgrounds wanting to play every sort of music - bits of classical, jazz, pop, improvisation.\" Until she was 18, she had lessons from her mother, too. \"I wasn't part of that hothouse thing. I didn't go to the Yehudi Menuhin school. I grew up with the idea of trying to make music available to people of all abilities.\" Just as everyone should be able to learn how to swim, or to speak a smattering of French, so, in her view should everybody be able to make a stab at learning the piano. Some kids have a flair and make rapid progress. Such kids, she says, can take care of themselves. She is fascinated by the others: those who chug along at varying rates of progress, enjoying it for a while, but all too often giving up. This falling off happens at any stage. Some kids find the beginning too frustrating. Others rebel at parental pressure driving them to \"be like those children on the telly\". A fair proportion bow out at Grade 5, the peak of the foothills, after which the going gets distinctly tougher. \"I worry that some people use music, like sport, as a way of making their children achieve things, rather than just saying: it's music, it's there to enjoy. I don't want to sound woolly, but the reason children fall by the wayside is because they feel they are not going to match up to their parents' high expectations.\" The production of her own training manuals begs an obvious question. Does she have a poor opinion of the existing corpus of tutor books, or indeed of the general quality of piano teaching? \"I'm very reluctant to criticise other people's teaching or others' tutor books,\" she says, shutting that avenue for discussion. What she does do is readily accept that her books, colourful and eye-catching though they are, are by no means the only books on the market designed to make the early years enjoyable. Her wheeze for luring the fives, sixes and sevens through those bewildering early months is to weave a storyline into the books and their accompanying CDs, right from the that first fumbling for middle C. Ned, a crepe-soled rocker with an extravagant quiff, and Grumper, a cat in cool shades, live on top of an old upright piano. A note, signed Scherzo Sisters, arrives: \"PianoWorld needs help today, Silent pianos get thrown away. To save the piano complete our tasks, That's all the Scherzo Sisters ask.\" And so the odyssey begins. First task. Find the Cs - \"they're always to the left of the two black keys\". The challenge at this fragile stage is to make the work interesting. \"Kids want something that sounds exciting and good, even if they're playing just one note.\" And so, from lesson one, there are accompaniments in a variety of styles for teacher - or parent - to play beneath the child's line. For kids whose parents aren't pianists, the accompaniments are recorded on the CDs. For five to seven year olds, learning the piano should be unadulterated fun, MacGregor insists. \"You have to allow them to improvise and give them a reason to play at either end of the keyboard and on the black notes and use the pedals.\" In Book 2, the characters fall inside the piano and open up opportunities for making a whole lot of weird noises. As progress is made, bigger obstacles loom. Children need to be coaxed quite hard to read the music rather than rely on ear. Having relied for so much of her own childhood on her very keen ear, MacGregor has considerable sympathy on this score. But perhaps the biggest problem of all is practice. How can children be persuaded to play a passage even once again, let alone many times over. She admits not having practised rigorously until she went to the Royal Academy of Music, after graduating in music from Cambridge. As a teenager, she had simply played what she liked: hymns at school, keyboard with bands, and lots of Gershwin for dance classes. At the Royal Academy and afterwards she began building up a contemporary repertoire whose formidable difficulties demanded practice. Now she loves practice. The eight hours a day that she gets through are the core of her musical life, she says, more important than performances. \"I have enormous sympathy with people who find it difficult to practise. I don't think people talk about practice enough.\" The secret of any practice, whether for 20 minutes or five hours, is to work out beforehand exactly what it is you are aiming to do, she says. Other tips: treat yourself - play the whole piece through, however many wrong notes. And mix hard with easy. \"If I'm learning a Birtwistle, and gosh that's hard. It's nice to play a piece by Eric Satie afterwards.\" But Birtwistle must wait for Book 4. \u00b7 PianoWorld Books 1-3, published by Faber Music, \u00a34.95 each.",

Colin Hutchinson, Chelsea's managing director, said he was given permission by Atletico to talk to Hasselbaink's agent Humphry Nijmen. \"It is true we have made an inquiry but other clubs are going down the same road,\" said Hutchinson \"That's as far as it's gone although we hope to take the matter a little bit further. \"It's well known in Spain that he is being linked to Valencia and Deportivo [la Coruna], who have won the championship, while the talk in Italy is of him possibly joining Lazio.\" Hasselbaink, sold to Atletico for \u00a312million nine months ago, will command an even higher fee after has scoring 24 league goals for Atletico. The Dutchman plays his last game for the relegated club tomorrow when he faces Espanyol in the Spanish Cup final. Chelsea are prepared to pay around \u00a314m for Hasselbaink although it is understood that Atletico have been holding out for \u00a317m given the widespread interest. Leeds are selling their Austrian defender Martin Hiden to one of his former clubs, Salzburg, for \u00a3500,000. The 27-year-old has struggled with injuries since moving to Elland Road for \u00a31.3m from Rapid Vienna in 1998. \u0095 The \u00a3475million redevelopment of Wembley has been given the go-ahead by Brent planning officers. After months of wrangling, it has been decided to recommend that the borough council's planning committee approves the scheme at its meeting next Thursday.",

When Kevin Keegan accepted the job of national coach just over a year ago, it was assumed someone so respected and charismatic would bring in a No2 of a similar stamp. </p> <p>There was a severe sense of anti-climax, however, when Keegan announced that his main assistant would be Derek Fazackerley. It was neither a sexy nor a household name, sounding more like a character from Coronation Street than the man who was going to mastermind England's revival. </p> <p>Apart from those he coached in fleeting spells at Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle, few knew who he was. Only those with good memories can recall his sterling service as a Preston-born workaday centre-half in the 70s at Ewood Park, where he is still their longest-serving player. But he had no international experience. And as for respected and charismatic. Well, quite frankly, no. </p> <p>But nobody was more surprised than Fazackerley himself when the call to national colours came just seconds before his call to the tea table. \"I'd been Kevin's first-team coach at Newcastle but we'd both gone our separate ways and I hadn't had much contact with him in 3 years,\" the 48-year-old remembers. </p> <p>\"Then one night just before tea-time I got a phone call and it was Kevin. It came completely out of the blue. He said he'd been approached for the England job and he was going to take it part-time for four games and would I like to come along for the ride? I was delighted and shocked, but you can't refuse that.\" </p> <p>He was also relieved because he was out of a job, having just been released as Blackburn coach. But he had obviously made an impression on Keegan during their time together at St James' Park. </p> <p>Tactical awareness is allegedly a chink in Keegan's armour but Fazackerley denies it is his job to fill it. \"No. Kevin's very much his own man when it comes to the team and tactics,\" he says. \"Obviously we do discuss things, as well as with Arthur Cox and Les Reed, the other coaches. But Kevin has the final say and I don't agree that he is not good tactically.\" </p> <p>So was Fazackerley picked for the contribution he could make to the team spirit which plays such a huge part in Keegan's game-plan? \"Well, I'm the worst teller of jokes you could ever meet in your life,\" he says. \"And practical jokes are the things people play on me. I wouldn't say I'm the life and soul of the party.\" </p> <p>He laughs at the suggestion that he is a sergeant-major on the training pitch. \"Day to day my job is to formulate the coaching and training for the whole squad. That might mean we split the squad into various groups with the attackers with Kevin and the defenders with me.\" </p> <p>But do not mistake Fazackerley for someone who just collects the balls and lays out the cones. He has scouted all England's first-phase opposition for the Euro 2000 finals, helped set up the training camp in Belgium and liaises regularly with Keegan. </p> <p>He was bitten by the scouting bug in a unique way. \"Within the first three months of joining Blackburn as an apprentice at 16, I picked up a thigh injury and I was told I could do absolutely nothing for 12 months. </p> <p>\"The manager of the time, Eddie Quigley, said to me 'We can't just have you sat around for 12 months picking up your \u00a38 a week and doing nothing'. So even at that age he said, you go and watch the opposition. </p> <p>\"So I used to go off to Blackpool, Preston, Burnley and Bury and places like that on a Saturday and watch the opposition Blackburn were playing soon. </p> <p>\"That provoked an interest in it. He was quite complimentary to me and he let me continue until the end of the season when I was fit enough to start training again.\" </p> <p>From Bury to Brazil on Saturday. That's life in the Faz lane.</p>",

But Kevin has the final say and I don't agree that he is not good tactically.\" So was Fazackerley picked for the contribution he could make to the team spirit which plays such a huge part in Keegan's game-plan? \"Well, I'm the worst teller of jokes you could ever meet in your life,\" he says. \"And practical jokes are the things people play on me. I wouldn't say I'm the life and soul of the party.\" He laughs at the suggestion that he is a sergeant-major on the training pitch. \"Day to day my job is to formulate the coaching and training for the whole squad. That might mean we split the squad into various groups with the attackers with Kevin and the defenders with me.\" But do not mistake Fazackerley for someone who just collects the balls and lays out the cones. He has scouted all England's first-phase opposition for the Euro 2000 finals, helped set up the training camp in Belgium and liaises regularly with Keegan. He was bitten by the scouting bug in a unique way. \"Within the first three months of joining Blackburn as an apprentice at 16, I picked up a thigh injury and I was told I could do absolutely nothing for 12 months. \"The manager of the time, Eddie Quigley, said to me 'We can't just have you sat around for 12 months picking up your \u00a38 a week and doing nothing'. So even at that age he said, you go and watch the opposition. \"So I used to go off to Blackpool, Preston, Burnley and Bury and places like that on a Saturday and watch the opposition Blackburn were playing soon. \"That provoked an interest in it. He was quite complimentary to me and he let me continue until the end of the season when I was fit enough to start training again.\" From Bury to Brazil on Saturday. That's life in the Faz lane.",

Inside the station's power plant, they replaced four solar-charged batteries that had failed or were failing. </p> <p>Outside the station, a pair of spacewalking astronauts fixed a wobbly crane, replaced a communications antenna, and assembled a Russian construction boom. </p> <p>Indications of a power fluctuation from one of the batteries had Mission Control in Houston talking about extending the mission by a day at one point. Their concerns evaporated when engineers determined the problem was on the ground, not in space.

      "bodyText": "Astronauts from the space shuttle Atlantis delivered a final boost to the flagging orbit of the International Space Station on Thursday, and Nasa declared the orbiting outpost nearly as good as new. The 18-month-old science project was losing orbit, low on power and urgently in need of repairs when Atlantis arrived last Sunday. Without the repairs and orbital boost courtesy of the shuttle, the station could not have been ready to receive its first live-aboard crew later this year. \"When we leave, we'll have a robust spacecraft,\" said the station's lead flight director, Paul Hill. During their stay, the Atlantis crew raised the station's orbit about 30 miles in three separate boosts, using the shuttle's thrusters. Inside the station's power plant, they replaced four solar-charged batteries that had failed or were failing. Outside the station, a pair of spacewalking astronauts fixed a wobbly crane, replaced a communications antenna, and assembled a Russian construction boom. Indications of a power fluctuation from one of the batteries had Mission Control in Houston talking about extending the mission by a day at one point. Their concerns evaporated when engineers determined the problem was on the ground, not in space. The only job left for the astronauts was to close the maze of hatches aboard the station in preparation for Friday's departure. The $60-billion project is a joint venture of the United States, Russia, Canada, Europe and Japan. In July, the two existing modules of the station are scheduled to dock with a Russian service module with the living quarters and life support needed to make the outpost fully habitable. Atlantis commander James Halsell and pilot Scott Horowitz performed the day's most important task, firing the shuttle's thrusters 26 times and pushing the station into an orbit 238 miles above Earth's surface. The station's orbit had been crumbling by about 1.5 miles a-week before Atlantis' arrival, putting it too low to intercept the Russian module in July. With four of six storage batteries either failed or failing and the faltering orbit caused by atmospheric drag, the station would not have been able to make that rendezvous if Nasa had not planned this repair mission last February. Most of the electrical work was performed by Russian Yuri Usachev and American Susan Helms. Usachev, who will command Helms and fellow Atlantis astronaut James Voss when the three return to the station as an expeditionary crew next year, had plenty of experience working with the Russian designed electrical systems aboard the station.

But the Fiver is really disinclined to talk about a Koogan team that, given the available options, looks half-sensible.

A tribute to the purring machine that is He Is, we had little difficulty constructing the thighs of steel, nor the ponytail of gold. However, the same could not be said of the gob of lead, because the open and shut mechanism got permanently stuck on \"wider than the Mississippi\". But like they say, as in animatronics, so in life ...</p> <p>\"I don't know if I'm going to be at Arsenal next season,\" He Is blathered on today, confirming what many back pages have been speculating for months. \"The only thing that I will say is that I am soon going to be 30 and if Arsenal get the opportunity to get a good return on their investment in me they must accept the offer,\" he told a French website (football365.fr) with an honesty that would be admirable in any other profession.</p> <p>Not so much admirable, as slightly weirdo were the remarks that followed (he's read the Celestine Prophecy, you know). \"I want to be part of a club which fires the imagination, and you can count those on the fingers of one hand,\" He Is said. \"When I say that, I include Arsenal, even though they might not be a 'mythical' club.\" He Is went on to list the number of mythical clubs on the fingers of one (severely mutated) hand. \"Manchester, Bayern, Barcelona, Real Madrid, AC Milan and Juventus. To become a mythical club, Arsenal need to win more European trophies.\"</p> <p>Now the cynics among you might point out that only last week, He Is played an integral part in failing to secure a European trophy for the Gunners. But He Is has not got where he is today by being blinkered to the truth, and he went on to observe: \"I don't know how Arsenal can hope to win the Champions League next season if they play like they did last season.\" At least on our robot there was an \"off\" button.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>CROCK OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>As one of the many who've watched that MPEG of his leg folding in two over and over, the Fiver would like to congratulate Henrik Larsson on his miraculous recovery from injury and selection in Sweden's Euro 2000 squad. We were going to offer the traditional theatrical wish of good luck, but decided against it.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>WINDASS IN EUROPE</strong></p> <p>Earlier this month, the campest chairman in football, Geoffrey Richmond, offered the world a wondrous vision of Bradford's future. \"Maybe in a year or two we could even win the Worthington or FA Cup,\" he purred in his best George-from-Rainbow voice; \"and I feel we could soon be challenging for a European place.\" Oh how the Fiver laughed at the prospect of the two Dean's (Fat-boy Windass and Boyo Saunders) going up belly to belly with the best in Europe! At the time, Bradford were odds-on for the drop, and Richmond seemed a worthy British contender for the title of world's craziest chairman (held for the past 17 years by Jesus \"I am not Christ\" Gil).</p> <p>Then, earlier today, something surreal happened: Uefa announced that Bradford will be joining Aston Villa in next season's Intertoto Cup - thus making Geoffrey's dream of Europe a reality, (and the Fiver's plan to distil, bottle and sell the hippy-trippy effluents in his water supply a distinct non-starter). Apparently two places have always been up for grabs for English clubs - but nobody ever bothered taking the second spot for the second round because it starts at the beginning of July.</p> <p>But now, an Italian team has dropped out of the competition, and Bradford are in. And they're as happy as whippet pie at the news. \"The chairman is in the building and he's absolutely delighted,\" a spokesman told the Fiver. And the players? \"They are blissfully unaware of the news because they're all on holiday.\" But won't they lose part of their summer break? \"They were originally due back on July 6, but I don't think there'll be too many dissenting voices when they're called back early to play in Europe,\" we were told. Of course there won't be - especially when they hear they'll be playing either Atlantis from Lithuania or a mid-table Turkish side. It doesn't get much bigger than that.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>COMPETITION NEWS</strong></p> <p>The answer to yesterday's question was Graeme Le Saux (not Gary Lineker, you idiots).

A tribute to the purring machine that is He Is, we had little difficulty constructing the thighs of steel, nor the ponytail of gold. However, the same could not be said of the gob of lead, because the open and shut mechanism got permanently stuck on \"wider than the Mississippi\". But like they say, as in animatronics, so in life ... \"I don't know if I'm going to be at Arsenal next season,\" He Is blathered on today, confirming what many back pages have been speculating for months. \"The only thing that I will say is that I am soon going to be 30 and if Arsenal get the opportunity to get a good return on their investment in me they must accept the offer,\" he told a French website (football365.fr) with an honesty that would be admirable in any other profession. Not so much admirable, as slightly weirdo were the remarks that followed (he's read the Celestine Prophecy, you know). \"I want to be part of a club which fires the imagination, and you can count those on the fingers of one hand,\" He Is said. \"When I say that, I include Arsenal, even though they might not be a 'mythical' club.\" He Is went on to list the number of mythical clubs on the fingers of one (severely mutated) hand. \"Manchester, Bayern, Barcelona, Real Madrid, AC Milan and Juventus. To become a mythical club, Arsenal need to win more European trophies.\" Now the cynics among you might point out that only last week, He Is played an integral part in failing to secure a European trophy for the Gunners. But He Is has not got where he is today by being blinkered to the truth, and he went on to observe: \"I don't know how Arsenal can hope to win the Champions League next season if they play like they did last season.\" At least on our robot there was an \"off\" button. * * * * * * * * * * * * * CROCK OF THE DAY As one of the many who've watched that MPEG of his leg folding in two over and over, the Fiver would like to congratulate Henrik Larsson on his miraculous recovery from injury and selection in Sweden's Euro 2000 squad. We were going to offer the traditional theatrical wish of good luck, but decided against it. * * * * * * * * * * * * * WINDASS IN EUROPE Earlier this month, the campest chairman in football, Geoffrey Richmond, offered the world a wondrous vision of Bradford's future. \"Maybe in a year or two we could even win the Worthington or FA Cup,\" he purred in his best George-from-Rainbow voice; \"and I feel we could soon be challenging for a European place.\" Oh how the Fiver laughed at the prospect of the two Dean's (Fat-boy Windass and Boyo Saunders) going up belly to belly with the best in Europe! At the time, Bradford were odds-on for the drop, and Richmond seemed a worthy British contender for the title of world's craziest chairman (held for the past 17 years by Jesus \"I am not Christ\" Gil). Then, earlier today, something surreal happened: Uefa announced that Bradford will be joining Aston Villa in next season's Intertoto Cup - thus making Geoffrey's dream of Europe a reality, (and the Fiver's plan to distil, bottle and sell the hippy-trippy effluents in his water supply a distinct non-starter). Apparently two places have always been up for grabs for English clubs - but nobody ever bothered taking the second spot for the second round because it starts at the beginning of July. But now, an Italian team has dropped out of the competition, and Bradford are in. And they're as happy as whippet pie at the news. \"The chairman is in the building and he's absolutely delighted,\" a spokesman told the Fiver. And the players? \"They are blissfully unaware of the news because they're all on holiday.\" But won't they lose part of their summer break? \"They were originally due back on July 6, but I don't think there'll be too many dissenting voices when they're called back early to play in Europe,\" we were told. Of course there won't be - especially when they hear they'll be playing either Atlantis from Lithuania or a mid-table Turkish side. It doesn't get much bigger than that. * * * * * * * * * * * * * COMPETITION NEWS The answer to yesterday's question was Graeme Le Saux (not Gary Lineker, you idiots). The winner was Dr Alastair Hudson, a professor of law at the University of London.

Sources close to the player say that the Nou Camp favourite will complete a move to Old Trafford within the next couple of weeks. Arsenal have had a \u00a35m bid for Barcelona playmaker Gabri turned down. The Catalan club have told Arsene Wenger he'll have to double his bid to sign the 20-year-old midfielder. Liverpool and Parma are targeting Swedish international striker Marcus Allback, who looks set to leave Gamla Ullevi in the summer. * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Both Rangers and Aberdeen are expected to be at full-strength for tomorrow's Scottish Cup final. Gers strikers Billy Dodds and Rod Wallace have recovered from their respective injuries. Likely line-ups: Aberdeen - Leighton, Lilley, Anderson, Solberg, McAllister, Rowson, Guntveit, Bernard, Dow, Jess, Stavrum. Rangers - Klos, Numan, Wilson, Vidmar, Porrini, Albertz, van Bronckhorst, Ferguson, Kanchelskis, Dodds, McCann. Former Arsenal striker Nicolas Anelka has left the door open for a second season with Real Madrid. The 21-year-old Frenchman, infamously suspended for 22 days and heavily fined for refusing to train with the side, said: \"There had been a few problems but they have been completely sorted out now. My future depends on the president of the club. We will have to discuss it. After that, we will see.\" Euro 2000 tournament director Alain Courtois today rejected criticism of the venue for England's clash with Germany on June 17, insisting: \"Charleroi is safe.\" He added: \"To those who want to tell us what to do, I tell them, 'Take care of your own fans and we take care of the stadiums.'\" Mark Bosnich will not be playing in this year's Olympic Games. \"I'm looking forward to more success with United next season,\" he said. \"I intend to come back in great condition after having a good rest.\" Dundee have completed the permanent signing of Javier Artero for a club record fee of \u00a3300,000. Celtic's Henrik Larsson and Marcus Allback have been added to Sweden's final 22 for Euro 2000. \"Henrik has shown a lot in practice,\" said manager Tommy Soderberg. \"He lacks match fitness but he is on his way, and that will be no problem in the championships.\" The Portugal squad for Euro 2000: Vitor Baia, Pedro Espinha, Joaquim Silva; Roberto Severo, Rui Jorge, Carlos Secretario, Jorge Costa, Abel Xavier, Fernando Couto, Dimas Teixeira; Paulo Sousa, Rui Costa, Luis Figo, Sergio Conceicao, Francisco Costa, Paulo Bento, Jose Vidigal; Joao Pinto, Nuno Gomes, Ricardo Sa Pinto, Pedro Resendes, Nuno Rocha. * * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO Sky Sports 2: Third division football - Live!

Cabinet ministers said yesterday the spending review is now the single biggest drain on ministerial time. The room for manoeuvre in the spending review covering the three years from 2001-02 to 2003-4 has been restricted by the prime minister's decision to give an average cash boost for health of 5.6% per year. Tony Blair has also committed himself to ensure education has \"the first call\" on government investment, suggesting schools and universities will receive comparable increases to those in health. If this proves to be the case, Whitehall departments, with the exception of education and health, will only have enough cash left to take a modest 2.4% rise over three years, according to the Institute of Fiscal Studies. Overall public spending, capital and current, is due to rise over the three years by 3.3% in real terms.

Julian Borger pays tribute to his\nfriend while, below, Maggie O'Kane explains why reporters choose to go to war",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>You probably would not know his name. He did not give his news to a television camera. Unlike many star reporters, he wrote stories without an accompanying portrait. But Kurt Schork, who was killed in Sierra Leone on Wednesday, was widely considered to be the greatest war correspondent of the post-Vietnam era.</p> <p>He wrote for Reuters, a news agency, which means that his perceptions of war in Bosnia, Kurdistan, Chechnya and Sierra Leone were customarily fed into the news machine that produces the articles you read in the newspapers and bulletins you see on television.</p> <p>His writing was the gold standard against which other journalists judged whether or not they had got the story right. So if you paid any attention over the past decade to news of far-flung violence and human rights abuses, you would have benefited from Kurt Schork's accuracy, his tenacity and the courage it took to be where he had to be to find out the truth.</p> <p>That's where he was on Wednesday with a small group of Reuters colleagues, at the edge of the known and unknown in a chaotic conflict, when they were ambushed by a group of rebels 50 miles from Freetown. Kurt was shot in the head and died instantly. His colleague, Miguel Gil Moreno, an Associated Press cameraman and producer who was also among the finest in his field, was killed too. Yannis Behrakis, a Reuters photographer, and Mark Chisholm, a Reuters cameramen, were both wounded.</p> <p>All four knew each other from the Bosnian war. They were all brave, but aware of the risks involved in their work and alert to the need to reassess them and control them at all times. Any reporter who knew them would have felt confident to have accompanied them. But risks can never be calculated entirely. The ground can shift beneath your feet without warning, especially in as fluid an unpredictable place as the Sierra Leonian bush this week. They would have known that, too, as they set out to do their job.</p> <p>I last saw Kurt a few days before he left for Sierra Leone. For such a perpetually energetic and restless person, he seemed extraordinarily rested and at ease. He had settled in Washington with his Bosnian girlfriend, Sabina Cosic, and had spent a few months renovating their flat. For someone who had lived out of a couple of suitcases for most of his journalistic career, it was a remarkable transformation. He was looking forward to reporting from behind the scenes at the Sydney Olympics. But there was just one more war. When the latest bout of violence erupted around Freetown I knew he would be there and, sure enough, the next time I tried to get in touch, he was gone.</p> <p>\"War junkie\" is an epithet often used for war correspondents, and in certain cases it more or less fits. But Kurt's relationship with violence and human conflict was much more complicated and had far more depth.</p> <p>Sean Maguire, a Reuters colleague, recalls Kurt explaining the fascination this way: \"In extreme situations people behave in remarkable ways. Most journalists are students of human behaviour. Reporting on that in those kinds of situations and stretching yourself at the same time - those are the major challenges you can face.\"</p> <p>In the course of his life, Kurt had posed himself all forms of human challenge - both mental and physical - and overcome them all with ease. Despite his modest height, he was a star American football player at school in the Washington suburbs, good enough to win a scholarship to university. His academic prowess then led to a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford, at the same time as Bill Clinton.</p> <p>He could never remember much about Clinton from that era, but yesterday Clinton remembered him, describing him as a good and a brave man. \"He went to a lot of places, a lot of the troubled and dangerous places of the world, to bring the news to people. And I am very sad about it,\" the president said yesterday.</p> <p>After university, Kurt worked for a string of democratic politicians, including Bill Bradley, for whom he was chief of staff but with whose indecisiveness and equivocation he eventually lost patience. For several years, he was chief of staff at New York's Mass Transit Authority, running the city's overburdened subway system. He also tried his hand at real estate development, and even as a racing driver, speeding Porsches around a New England racetrack. Then, at the age of 40, he suddenly declared he was going to become a war correspondent. \"He was at a stage when he decided he just had to do it,\" says his brother, John Schork. \"And if he was going to be a journalist he wouldn't do things by half-measure. He was into ice climbing and he was an avid and expert skier.\"</p> <p>If it was extremity which drew Kurt to Kurdistan and Bosnia, it was the human and moral imperatives which made him stay. \"He was not a religious person but for him honesty and morality were always absolutes, he had a sense of fairness,\" says his brother. Kurt arrived in Bosnia in the summer of 1992 and stayed for five years, the longest-serving foreign correspondent of the Bosnian war. He did not think it was right to take weekends off, or holidays, while the population had no way of leaving. He would wake up before dawn most days and run through the shell-scarred streets, and usually finish his morning round-up of the night's developments by the time most of the press corps were getting up.</p> <p>But the mark of his superiority as a journalist was the fact that the story never came before the people. Joel Brand, a US journalist also in Sarajevo for most of the war, recalled eating pizza with Kurt one day when shells began to fall on a neighbourhood nearby. \"My first reaction was to drive away from the shells, his first reaction was to drive towards the shells,\" he says. They came across a pile of wounded and bleeding civilians and Kurt immediately jumped out and started loading them into the car. A group of French soldiers arrived in an armoured vehicle, took one look and drove away, but Kurt - with no protection (he believed wearing a flak jacket was an insult to the Bosnians who had none) - insisted on getting everyone who could be helped to hospital.</p> <p>\"Above all else, he was a humanitarian. He knew better than most journalists how to walk the fine line between doing what he had to do to be a reporter and doing what he needed to do to help people,\" says Brand. \"Kurt stood for everything that I wanted to stand for.\"</p> <p>Malcolm Brabant, the award-winning BBC correspondent who also covered the Bosnian war, says simply: \"Nobody compared to him in the slightest.\"</p> <p>Before he left for Sierra Leone, Kurt said he was still tinkering with a much-delayed book about Bosnia, and there are efforts afoot now to get it published. It is far from being the first work on the subject, of course, and it will almost certainly not be the last. But there is no doubt whatsoever that it will be fair, accurate, funny and, quite simply, the best.</p> <p><b>'We are driven by ego, insecurity and... sometimes, a desire to do some bit of good'</b></p> <p>Through the fug of early morning waking the radio spat a few disjointed words at me - first there was \"foreign correspondent\", and, as I woke up, \"American\". And then \"Reuters\". I knew then that it was Kurt Schork. This wasn't supposed to happen to journalists like him. He was too experienced, too levelheaded, too sober.

      "bodyText": "You probably would not know his name. He did not give his news to a television camera. Unlike many star reporters, he wrote stories without an accompanying portrait. But Kurt Schork, who was killed in Sierra Leone on Wednesday, was widely considered to be the greatest war correspondent of the post-Vietnam era. He wrote for Reuters, a news agency, which means that his perceptions of war in Bosnia, Kurdistan, Chechnya and Sierra Leone were customarily fed into the news machine that produces the articles you read in the newspapers and bulletins you see on television. His writing was the gold standard against which other journalists judged whether or not they had got the story right. So if you paid any attention over the past decade to news of far-flung violence and human rights abuses, you would have benefited from Kurt Schork's accuracy, his tenacity and the courage it took to be where he had to be to find out the truth. That's where he was on Wednesday with a small group of Reuters colleagues, at the edge of the known and unknown in a chaotic conflict, when they were ambushed by a group of rebels 50 miles from Freetown. Kurt was shot in the head and died instantly. His colleague, Miguel Gil Moreno, an Associated Press cameraman and producer who was also among the finest in his field, was killed too. Yannis Behrakis, a Reuters photographer, and Mark Chisholm, a Reuters cameramen, were both wounded. All four knew each other from the Bosnian war. They were all brave, but aware of the risks involved in their work and alert to the need to reassess them and control them at all times. Any reporter who knew them would have felt confident to have accompanied them. But risks can never be calculated entirely. The ground can shift beneath your feet without warning, especially in as fluid an unpredictable place as the Sierra Leonian bush this week. They would have known that, too, as they set out to do their job. I last saw Kurt a few days before he left for Sierra Leone. For such a perpetually energetic and restless person, he seemed extraordinarily rested and at ease. He had settled in Washington with his Bosnian girlfriend, Sabina Cosic, and had spent a few months renovating their flat. For someone who had lived out of a couple of suitcases for most of his journalistic career, it was a remarkable transformation. He was looking forward to reporting from behind the scenes at the Sydney Olympics. But there was just one more war. When the latest bout of violence erupted around Freetown I knew he would be there and, sure enough, the next time I tried to get in touch, he was gone. \"War junkie\" is an epithet often used for war correspondents, and in certain cases it more or less fits. But Kurt's relationship with violence and human conflict was much more complicated and had far more depth. Sean Maguire, a Reuters colleague, recalls Kurt explaining the fascination this way: \"In extreme situations people behave in remarkable ways. Most journalists are students of human behaviour. Reporting on that in those kinds of situations and stretching yourself at the same time - those are the major challenges you can face.\" In the course of his life, Kurt had posed himself all forms of human challenge - both mental and physical - and overcome them all with ease. Despite his modest height, he was a star American football player at school in the Washington suburbs, good enough to win a scholarship to university. His academic prowess then led to a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford, at the same time as Bill Clinton. He could never remember much about Clinton from that era, but yesterday Clinton remembered him, describing him as a good and a brave man. \"He went to a lot of places, a lot of the troubled and dangerous places of the world, to bring the news to people. And I am very sad about it,\" the president said yesterday. After university, Kurt worked for a string of democratic politicians, including Bill Bradley, for whom he was chief of staff but with whose indecisiveness and equivocation he eventually lost patience. For several years, he was chief of staff at New York's Mass Transit Authority, running the city's overburdened subway system. He also tried his hand at real estate development, and even as a racing driver, speeding Porsches around a New England racetrack. Then, at the age of 40, he suddenly declared he was going to become a war correspondent. \"He was at a stage when he decided he just had to do it,\" says his brother, John Schork. \"And if he was going to be a journalist he wouldn't do things by half-measure. He was into ice climbing and he was an avid and expert skier.\" If it was extremity which drew Kurt to Kurdistan and Bosnia, it was the human and moral imperatives which made him stay. \"He was not a religious person but for him honesty and morality were always absolutes, he had a sense of fairness,\" says his brother. Kurt arrived in Bosnia in the summer of 1992 and stayed for five years, the longest-serving foreign correspondent of the Bosnian war. He did not think it was right to take weekends off, or holidays, while the population had no way of leaving. He would wake up before dawn most days and run through the shell-scarred streets, and usually finish his morning round-up of the night's developments by the time most of the press corps were getting up. But the mark of his superiority as a journalist was the fact that the story never came before the people. Joel Brand, a US journalist also in Sarajevo for most of the war, recalled eating pizza with Kurt one day when shells began to fall on a neighbourhood nearby. \"My first reaction was to drive away from the shells, his first reaction was to drive towards the shells,\" he says. They came across a pile of wounded and bleeding civilians and Kurt immediately jumped out and started loading them into the car. A group of French soldiers arrived in an armoured vehicle, took one look and drove away, but Kurt - with no protection (he believed wearing a flak jacket was an insult to the Bosnians who had none) - insisted on getting everyone who could be helped to hospital. \"Above all else, he was a humanitarian. He knew better than most journalists how to walk the fine line between doing what he had to do to be a reporter and doing what he needed to do to help people,\" says Brand. \"Kurt stood for everything that I wanted to stand for.\" Malcolm Brabant, the award-winning BBC correspondent who also covered the Bosnian war, says simply: \"Nobody compared to him in the slightest.\" Before he left for Sierra Leone, Kurt said he was still tinkering with a much-delayed book about Bosnia, and there are efforts afoot now to get it published. It is far from being the first work on the subject, of course, and it will almost certainly not be the last. But there is no doubt whatsoever that it will be fair, accurate, funny and, quite simply, the best. 'We are driven by ego, insecurity and... sometimes, a desire to do some bit of good' Through the fug of early morning waking the radio spat a few disjointed words at me - first there was \"foreign correspondent\", and, as I woke up, \"American\". And then \"Reuters\". I knew then that it was Kurt Schork. This wasn't supposed to happen to journalists like him. He was too experienced, too levelheaded, too sober. A non-smoker, a non-drinker, 5.30am riser. He was 53 but looked 40. I had been bumping into him since we both started this job 10 years ago. Why he covered almost every single conflict of the last 10 years, I don't know. Partly, I think, because it challenged him hugely and he needed a challenge. I also suspect that he was a \"believer\". A believer that journalists can make a difference. Miguel Moreno, the Spanish cameraman who died with him, certainly made a difference when he provided the world with the only pictures of the suffering of the people in Grozny - playing Russian roulette with his own life to get them.

      "body": "<p>Fashion folk are notoriously computer phobic. Computers are big, square, ugly things that mostly come in grey. Why should the fasherati relinquish their gorgeous Smythson stationery and Mont Blanc pens to communicate via something so impersonal? And why shop on the net when there's Bond Street? </p> <p>Perhaps this might interest them more. If a new exhibition is anything to go by, computers are set to revolutionise the way we dress. On Tuesday, US company Charmed Technology revealed its first collection of wearable computers - WCs, as they are unfortunately known. The show, Brave New Unwired World, took place at the Earls Court Internet World UK 2000 exhibition and will tour the world in the next few months. Its mission is to showcase smart clothes that think and perform. </p> <p>\"The body and technology will become one in the future. But people don't want to look like cyborgs when it happens,\" says Alex Lightman, CEO of Charmed. \"Fashion is the answer. We aim to reduce technology in size so much that it can be worn on the body. We want to personalise it so it knows and helps the individual. And of course we're going to make it look good.\" </p> <p>Lightman's company plans a vast range of WCs. In the future, a dress will be more than just a dress. It will monitor health, aid communication, provide instant access to information and more. \"Originally, technology separated everybody. Charmed will connect people,\" says vice president Katrina Barillova. </p> <p>So what are these wonderful gadgets and how do they work? First up, the Charmed Badge - a good stocking filler for the networker. In a room full of people wearing these, the badge will bleep when you pass someone with similar business interests or even sexual preference, depending on what sort of party you're at. Then there's the Charmed Communicator, a device that combines TV, video, radio, mobile phone, internet and email, and the Terrera, a camera and computer that recognises buildings and street names, thus helping travellers. There is something with bio-sensors that release medicinal mists around asthma sufferers and a device that delivers vitamins into the skin. Indulgent options included tubes that squirt essential oils while massaging the skin, as well as a gadget that plays soothing music. </p> <p>Smart jewellery is an option, too. There are necklaces that pick up voice vibrations so the wearer can communicate quietly, for example if dictating something confidential, and mobile phone earrings. Cheesiest are matching \"His and Hers\" bracelets. Girls - feeling soppy? Just press a button on yours and no matter where your partner is, his bracelet will become warm or vibrate. </p> <p>Another innovation is e-broidery, conductive thread that can be sewn into any fabric, in any way, and connected to a tiny computer. Barillova shows off a keyboard sewn into the fabric on your knees and a scarf version (how chic) that can be whipped from your neck and typed on anywhere. </p> <p>These inventions might sound outlandish - not to say unnecessary - but they are here to stay. Charmed, a year-old spin-off from the Media Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was one of the first companies to make WCs, along with Nasa and Philips. The Media Lab spends $20m per year on research and development, and will be backing Charmed. The company already has seven offices worldwide. \"The project is going to be huge,\" Barillova says. \"It will completely change people's lives. We want to give six billion people instant access to the internet via WCs.\" </p> <p>An ex-bodyguard to government officials all over the world, Barillova is one of the few to have used WCs in the course of her job. \"It gave me a huge advantage over other people - instant information. Maps, statistics, everything. I used to sew the technology into whatever I was wearing. If I walked into a room, my camera would survey the crowd and tell me who everyone was and what they did.\" </p> <p>Charmed's sensory designer, Jenny Tillotson, has another party trick: the Phero-mate. Spot a potential pull and your ruched top will automatically release a cloud of sexual scent. He won't be able to say no. Could this be the new way to make clothes appeal to men? New toys that get the girls? \"There will be a whole new tribe of consumers who will be looking at the function rather than the label,\" Barillova reckons. </p> <p>A fashionista could train her WC to do all sorts of useful things. It could store information from every style mag in the world, so it knows exactly where to buy the perfect pair of trousers. \"Your WC will learn about you, taking messages or contacting the doctor if you need an appointment. It will become your best friend,\" Barillova insists. Best friend? Surely that's taking things a bit far. </p> <p>How all this technology will gel with the fashion industry is hard to say. It's difficult to imagine Yves Saint Laurent or Balmain sewing keyboards into their haute couture creations, however discreet. But if WC technology should fall into the magical mitts of someone like Rei Kawakubo at Comme des Gar\u00e7ons, something quite beautiful could be born. </p> <p>Let's hope WCs catch on with international designers soon because the actual clothes at Charmed were dreadful. Most looked like something Steps would wear on a world tour: silver PVC, tight Lycra, strappy body harnesses. \"At the moment, the clothes are simple because we want to put the emphasis on gadgets like the jewellery,\" says Charmed's director of events, Megan Griffith. \"But the possibilities are endless. All the designers I've spoken to are very excited about the creative potential.\" </p> <p>\"Designers want something new,\" Barillova says. \"Fashion is stuck and whether it's the 30s or the 70s, they're all waiting for something to happen. This is it. With the convergence of technology and fashion, designers can really start to use their talents. Creating rather than rehashing.\" </p> <p>\"Design is about brands and we don't want to give ours away,\" Lightman adds. \"We'll use in-house designers for the next few years, pulling talent from colleges.\" </p> <p>So when will the Charmed collection hit the shop floor? \"Sooner than you think,\" Barillova says. A third of the WCs in the show will be on sale early next year and the badge is already being leased to conference and trade show organisers. \"In two to five years' time, everyone will wear WCs as often as they use cell phones.\" With a little more thought on the design front, she might be right. Designers, are you ready?</p>",

The Donaldson plan, which also calls on the party to defend the Royal Ulster Constabulary's name and insignia, was brusquely rejected by the party leader, David Trimble. \"There isn't anything new in this,\" he said. \"On a number of occasions over [the] last year, proposals very like this were explored.

      "body": "<p>Chinese consumers with a growing taste for western goods welcomed the US house of representatives vote to normalise trade relations with China yesterday. The decision was also hailed by those hoping that foreign competition will speed up economic and perhaps even political reform.</p> <p>\"It is definitely a good thing,\" said the manager of a photographic shop. \"The US has Kodak, their products are famous around the world. Now China's companies will be able to join the world family.\"</p> <p>Chinese officials in Beijing showed relief at the vote, saying it was a \"wise move\" which would benefit long-term relations with Washington.

      "bodyText": "Chinese consumers with a growing taste for western goods welcomed the US house of representatives vote to normalise trade relations with China yesterday. The decision was also hailed by those hoping that foreign competition will speed up economic and perhaps even political reform. \"It is definitely a good thing,\" said the manager of a photographic shop. \"The US has Kodak, their products are famous around the world. Now China's companies will be able to join the world family.\" Chinese officials in Beijing showed relief at the vote, saying it was a \"wise move\" which would benefit long-term relations with Washington. But the new move towards globalisation worries many Chinese workers and factory managers who fear it will lead to huge job losses in industries which were previously protected. China's foreign ministry denounced the house of representatives' decision to set up a special panel to monitor its human rights situation - a concession to US critics of the vote for permanent normal trade relations (PNTR).

      "body": "<b>Dear Anne,</b> <br> For the last 20-30 years the answer to this question has been a largely unquestioned and resounding no. Zero tolerance of any form of war, weapon and superhero play has held sway in the majority of early-years settings and has been adopted by many parents. This approach has an admirable pedigree, arising from both pacifist and feminist aspirations to intervene in the spiral of violence and stamp out male violence at an early age. This is a perspective to which I vigorously subscribed myself as a parent and teacher - until recently. The central difficulty is that a zero tolerance approach simply does not work. In addition, there is no conclusive research to implicate this area of play in the development of aggressive adult behaviour. In most early-years classrooms there will always be a small group of boys (rarely girls) for whom this area of play is a dominant interest, and they are not for turning. My experience has been that far from gently enticing these boys into more \"worthy\" areas of play, our constant negativity towards their interests only serves to erode their self-esteem, stunt their imaginative development and turn them into creative liars, as the weapons they construct become mobile phones, drills or hosepipes as soon as they see an adult approach. On the other hand, when we relax such stringent approaches and allow children to construct weapons and play out \"superhero\" scenarios, I have seen these same boys flourish imaginatively and emotionally. Their aggressive play diminishes. (I'm not talking about toy guns as purchased in toy shops \u00be these are single-purpose toys that can only be pointed and shot). They control the child's play). A general principle of early learning is that we start from where the child is. Why have we been making such a glaring exception for this area of play? I would suggest that while zero tolerance has a discernible moral rationale, it is lacking in pedagogical sense. With adult support, sensitive guidance and boundaries maintained around real aggression, I'd say the answer to this question should now be yes.

The Hillsborough deal is the way forward. Any attempt to undermine it is a serious mistake at this time.\" \u0095 A man was shot dead in Belfast today. The shooting occurred near the scene of Wednesday's assassination attempt in Old Park, north Belfast. The attack was believed to be part of a Loyalist paramilitary feud.",

It's always better to be safe than sorry.\"<br><strong>Grimsby Evening Telegraph</strong></p> <h2>Have I got loos for you</h2> <br> Life has taken a turn for the worse for the residents of a housing estate in Basildon, Essex. <p>The inhabitants of the Malyons council estate have had to put up with volcanoes of raw sewage erupting from their lavatories.</p> <p>The trouble started a few weeks ago when several households reported that rather than removing waste from their bathroom, their toilets were bringing the stuff in, flooding the floors with a foul-smelling slick of noisome ordure.</p> <p>\"The toilet started making funny noises,\" said Leslie Joshua, 48. \"And then suddenly it was full of disgusting sewage. I had to use a saucepan to bail it out to prevent the entire bathroom flooding.\"</p> <p>Other residents reported similar problems, including one man who returned from his tai-kwando class to find a 3ft geyser of excrement spurting from his loo. \"I'm a blue belt,\" he explained. \"But there was nothing I could do to stop it.\"</p> <p>Basildon council has begun an investigation, but those affected have threatened to withhold their council tax until their lavatories are returned to normal. \"I've lived on this estate for 12 years,\" said one woman. \"And frankly, I've had all the crap I can take.\"<br><strong>This is Essex</strong></p> <h2>Kicking up a stink</h2> <br> More unpleasant aromas in Sherborne, Dorset, where neighbours are up in arms about the smell coming from a local fibreglass factory. <p>Residents say the factory, owned by the German company CS Interglas, has always emitted an unpleasant odour. But over the last few months the stench has become unbearable.</p> <p>\"We're at the end of our tether,\" fumed George Kirkby. \"We've been trying to sell our house, and the reason our buyers pulled out was the smell from the factory.\" \"I'm sorry to be graphic,\" said another local man, \"but it really is like living directly behind a giant who can't stop breaking wind. I've started wearing a cycle mask when I work in my garden.\"</p> <p>CS Interglas insists that it is aware of the problem, and is taking action to deal with it, installing a \u00a320,000 bio-mass filtration unit to dispel the vapours.</p> <p>\"I've no idea what a bio-mass filtration unit is,\" said one woman, \"But if it gets rid of bad smells I might look at buying one to attach to my husband's armpits.\"<br><strong>Western Gazette</strong></p> <h2>Bee afraid - bee very afraid</h2> <br> It's not just Britain's youth who are accused of becoming increasingly delinquent. Our bees, too, it seems, no longer have any respect for law and order. <p>Such has certainly been the case at Iford Manor, Wiltshire, where a swarm of rebellious bees have been terrorising picnickers in a meadow beside the River Frome.</p> <p>\"We'd just opened the picnic basket,\" said one woman, \"When this huge swarm of bees came at us out of the woods. We packed everything up and ran away, and the bees disappeared. When we tried to go back into the field, however, they came at us again. It's like they were deliberately trying to drive us away.\"</p> <p>There have been similar reports of unprovoked apian aggression in the same meadow, and now Elizabeth Cartwright-Hignett, the owner of Iford Manor, has warned picnickers to avoid the place.</p> <p>\"There are a number of commercial hives on the hill above, and wild bees in the woods,\" she explained. \"The combination of these and jam sandwiches is not a good one.\" She has advised picnickers to use other spots further along the river which, so far at least, seem to be free of bee activity.</p> <p>\"It's another example of how this country's going down the drain,\" said one man. \"I fought in the war, and now I can't go for a walk without fear of being attacked. We should bring back National Service.\"<br><strong>Bath Chronicle</strong></p> <h2>Letter of the week</h2> <br> I read with disgust the comments of Robert Goodwill, my Tory MEP for Yorkshire and Humberside, about his ability to make a nice profit on travel expenses at my expense as a taxpayer. <p>He is reported to have said that when he flies from Leeds-Bradford Airport to Brussels he gets a set fee of \u00a3500 - and so he buys an economy class ticket for between \u00a3160 and \u00a3250 and pockets the difference.</p> <p>He allegedly says that as a capitalist and a British Conservative he sees it as a challenge to make some profit because that is the system.</p> <p>Well I'm glad you feel that way, Mr Goodwill. You have just ripped me off as a taxpayer. And as such you have lost my good will, and also my vote in the next European elections. I shall now vote for any party that wants to pull out of Europe because no matter which of the major parties one votes for, the gravy train still rolls along merrily and unabated.\"<br><strong>Ian Cartwright, This is Grimsby</strong></p>",

But over the last few months the stench has become unbearable. \"We're at the end of our tether,\" fumed George Kirkby. \"We've been trying to sell our house, and the reason our buyers pulled out was the smell from the factory.\" \"I'm sorry to be graphic,\" said another local man, \"but it really is like living directly behind a giant who can't stop breaking wind. I've started wearing a cycle mask when I work in my garden.\" CS Interglas insists that it is aware of the problem, and is taking action to deal with it, installing a \u00a320,000 bio-mass filtration unit to dispel the vapours. \"I've no idea what a bio-mass filtration unit is,\" said one woman, \"But if it gets rid of bad smells I might look at buying one to attach to my husband's armpits.\" Western Gazette Bee afraid - bee very afraid It's not just Britain's youth who are accused of becoming increasingly delinquent. Our bees, too, it seems, no longer have any respect for law and order. Such has certainly been the case at Iford Manor, Wiltshire, where a swarm of rebellious bees have been terrorising picnickers in a meadow beside the River Frome. \"We'd just opened the picnic basket,\" said one woman, \"When this huge swarm of bees came at us out of the woods. We packed everything up and ran away, and the bees disappeared. When we tried to go back into the field, however, they came at us again. It's like they were deliberately trying to drive us away.\" There have been similar reports of unprovoked apian aggression in the same meadow, and now Elizabeth Cartwright-Hignett, the owner of Iford Manor, has warned picnickers to avoid the place. \"There are a number of commercial hives on the hill above, and wild bees in the woods,\" she explained. \"The combination of these and jam sandwiches is not a good one.\" She has advised picnickers to use other spots further along the river which, so far at least, seem to be free of bee activity. \"It's another example of how this country's going down the drain,\" said one man. \"I fought in the war, and now I can't go for a walk without fear of being attacked. We should bring back National Service.\" Bath Chronicle Letter of the week I read with disgust the comments of Robert Goodwill, my Tory MEP for Yorkshire and Humberside, about his ability to make a nice profit on travel expenses at my expense as a taxpayer. He is reported to have said that when he flies from Leeds-Bradford Airport to Brussels he gets a set fee of \u00a3500 - and so he buys an economy class ticket for between \u00a3160 and \u00a3250 and pockets the difference. He allegedly says that as a capitalist and a British Conservative he sees it as a challenge to make some profit because that is the system. Well I'm glad you feel that way, Mr Goodwill. You have just ripped me off as a taxpayer. And as such you have lost my good will, and also my vote in the next European elections. I shall now vote for any party that wants to pull out of Europe because no matter which of the major parties one votes for, the gravy train still rolls along merrily and unabated.\" Ian Cartwright, This is Grimsby",

Cons: Tends towards the serious - but then, we don't have barbecuing championships to prepare for. It may surprise you to learn that UK versions don't really qualify as barbecuing, but there are recipes for \"grilling\" too. Coming soon: The sun?",

Sadly, the reports in the newspapers here told us nothing about how he cooked them. Did he, for example, braise them with soy sauce, sugar, fermented bean curd, dried bean curd, water and rice wine to make the classic Chinese dish of hon tsao go zo (red cooked dog)? Or did he favour the Hawaiian style of spatchcocking them and grilling them on the barbecue with sweet potatoes? </p> <p>Of course, it could never happen here. In a country where a large number of people will take direct action on behalf of veal calves and mink (although not for the less appealing battery chickens or farmed salmon), Lacoste would probably have been lynched by a mob of Barbara Cartland lookalikes long before he got to court. </p> <p>It's many years since dog and cat have been on the menu in the western world, with the exception of aberrations such as the Swiss ged\u00f6rrtes hundefleisch (dried dog meat) and the Spanish recipe caldo de gato Extremadura (Estremaduran cat stew in which the feline is cooked in white wine with bay leaves and thyme and served with broad beans, carrots, turnips, potatoes and onions). But this wasn't always the case. </p> <p>At the same time that the Greeks were debating the shape of political institutions and the transmigration of souls, they were also partial to a spot of dog. Indeed, Hippocrates recommended dog or puppy flesh as part of a health-giving diet. But subsequently their position as our most favoured domestic companions, frequently with human qualities ascribed to them, has created a taboo against eating them almost as powerful as that of cannibalism. </p> <p>There has never been the same prohibition in other parts of the world against eating dog or cat. The Mexican hairless dog was a prime food source for the Aztecs. In his landmark work, Unmentionable Cuisine, Calvin W Schwabe lists 10 recipes for dog and four for cat, covering China, Ghana, Hawaii, Burma and the Philippines, as well as those from Switzerland and Spain already described. He fails to mention Korea, where there is a fine tradition for eating dog (indeed, there is said to be a Korean restaurant in New Malden where you may be served dog if you ask for it politely), and he only touches briefly on the Filipino passion for dog, which is so great that the government had to control the consumption after several people contracted rabies as a result of eating rabid animals. </p> <p>Generally speaking, Europeans have only turned to eating dog flesh in extremis. During the siege of Paris in 1870, a contemporary calculated that Parisians ate 1,200 dogs, 5,000 cats and 65,000 horses before they turned to rats and the contents of the Paris zoo with the same enthusiasm and ingenuity that they reserve for more conventional foods. </p> <p>No doubt in similar circumstances we British would eventually take to the same course of action, albeit with rather more soul-searching. \"I had a slice of spaniel the other day,\" wrote the English journalist and member of parliament, Henry Labouchere, in a report from Paris during the siege, adding that \"it made me feel like a cannibal\". Sir Ernest Shackleton's expedition team to the Antarctic, trapped in the polar ice, also managed to stomach man's best friend rather than face starvation. </p> <p>There has never been quite the same revulsion at the thought of eating horse meat as there has been for dog and cat. The demand may be declining now, but it is still vigorous in Belgium, Italy and France. The tradition goes back to the Romans, who would eat just about anything including door mice. Subsequently eating horse meat fell from grace because the Roman Catholic church frowned on it, associating it with pagan practices. </p> <p>However, it is said that demand for this old favourite was rekindled after the Battle of Eylau when Baron Larrey, military surgeon to the First Empire, advised the exhausted French troops to eat the flesh of the dead horses, braised in the cavalry breast plates and seasoned with gunpowder, because it was a ready source of protein. La Grande Arm\u00e9e developed rather a taste for it, and French soldiers demanded horse meat whenever they returned home . </p> <p>While we have looked to the French for so much of our culinary culture, it might be thought that we haven't shared this particular passion for equine gastronomy. However, we haven't always been quite so squeamish about eating horse meat. </p> <p> The first serious attempt to get the British to eat chevaline occurred in 1867. Following the success of Banquet Hippographique in Paris in 1865, which included consomm\u00e9 de cheval, cheval bouilli aux choux, cheval \u00e0 la mode and c\u00f4te de cheval braise, a dinner was organised by the Society for the Propagation of Horse Flesh at the Langham Hotel, following a sharp rise in the price of beef as a result of an epidemic among cattle - a familiar enough tale. </p> <p>At the time it was reported that several shops were doing a roaring trade in horse meat, no doubt helped by the fact that it was considerably cheaper than beef. </p> <p>In spite of this early success horse did not become the meat of choice, but its consumption in parts of the country survived until relatively recently. In particular, Yorkshire used to be a hotbed of equine gourmets, the last butcher devoted to the preparation of horse meat closing in Bradford in 1938. And now there are persistent rumours about horse butchery making a surreptitious return to the meat counter. It is said that there's a butcher selling horse meat in Birmingham and of another in Brixton market. </p> <p>At the beginning of the BSE disaster some authorities in this country saw horse meat as a ready substitute for beef, pointing out that it had the additional advantages of being extremely healthy. It is low in fat and free of any form of prophylactic antibiotics. There was even a proposal that the anthem of the television cowboy Roy Rogers to his horse Trigger could be adapted as an advertising jingle, along the lines of: \"A four-legged friend, a four-legged friend, he'll never let you down.

      "body": "<p>Russia's film-making community is in uproar over President Vladimir Putin's decision to abolish the film ministry - a move they claim will cripple the struggling industry.</p> <p>Leading film directors this week held an emergency meeting to protest that Russia's cinema tradition would not survive without the support of the powerful state committee for cinematography (Goskino) to lobby for it.</p> <p>As part of a government streamlining drive ordered by Mr Putin this week, Goskino is to be swallowed up by the ministry of culture. \"Everything will go to pieces, there will be a total collapse,\" Sergei Lazaruk, Goskino's deputy chairman, warned yesterday.</p> <p>The head of Russia's independent film studio, Mosfilm, was also adamant that the decision would have dire consequences. \"The abolition of this ministry just when Russia's film industry is beginning to come back to life can only be interpreted as a deliberate attempt to destroy the country's cinema,\" he said.</p> <p>Russia's most famous and politically influential director, Nikita Mikhalkov - who made the Oscar-winning Burnt by the Sun - is to lead a group of prominent film industry figures to appeal to Mr Putin next week, in an attempt to get him to rethink.</p> <p>Protesters are worried that without the expertise concentrated in the walls of Goskino, bureaucracy will intensify and the quality of Russia's films will drop. There is also concern that the modest profits the industry has recently begun to make will be siphoned off to subsidise other cultural projects.</p> <p>\"Five years ago when Russian film was destitute and half dead, no one paid any attention to Goskino,\" Mr Mikhalkov said. The government had noticed it only because \"the industry has started to be profitable,\" he said.</p> <p>No independent-minded film makers would have campaigned for the preservation of Goskino 20 years ago.

      "bodyText": "Russia's film-making community is in uproar over President Vladimir Putin's decision to abolish the film ministry - a move they claim will cripple the struggling industry. Leading film directors this week held an emergency meeting to protest that Russia's cinema tradition would not survive without the support of the powerful state committee for cinematography (Goskino) to lobby for it. As part of a government streamlining drive ordered by Mr Putin this week, Goskino is to be swallowed up by the ministry of culture. \"Everything will go to pieces, there will be a total collapse,\" Sergei Lazaruk, Goskino's deputy chairman, warned yesterday. The head of Russia's independent film studio, Mosfilm, was also adamant that the decision would have dire consequences. \"The abolition of this ministry just when Russia's film industry is beginning to come back to life can only be interpreted as a deliberate attempt to destroy the country's cinema,\" he said. Russia's most famous and politically influential director, Nikita Mikhalkov - who made the Oscar-winning Burnt by the Sun - is to lead a group of prominent film industry figures to appeal to Mr Putin next week, in an attempt to get him to rethink. Protesters are worried that without the expertise concentrated in the walls of Goskino, bureaucracy will intensify and the quality of Russia's films will drop. There is also concern that the modest profits the industry has recently begun to make will be siphoned off to subsidise other cultural projects. \"Five years ago when Russian film was destitute and half dead, no one paid any attention to Goskino,\" Mr Mikhalkov said. The government had noticed it only because \"the industry has started to be profitable,\" he said. No independent-minded film makers would have campaigned for the preservation of Goskino 20 years ago. The organisation has its roots in a 1919 decree by Lenin, ordering the film industry to be harnessed to the state's crusade for ideological enlightenment. In the Soviet era, Goskino's remit was to \"strengthen the role of cinema in the building of communism\" and to \"help in the active promotion of Marxist-Leninist views among the Soviet people\". Censors in the script-reading room of Goskino's Moscow headquarters spent all day scanning new texts for ideological suitability. The organisation was disbanded in 1991, but after several months of chaos film-makers decided they needed a central coordinating body and Goskino was resurrected to allocate government subsidies and to organise film distribution. It has worked since then in an administrative support capacity, championing the interests of film-makers. After a barren stretch, the film industry is beginning to see a revival. Domestic enthusiasm for cinema is growing; in the mid-1990s, 97% of Russians did not visit the cinema even once a year. Last year, 35% ventured out to the cinema at least once. In last year's budget, the government allocated \u00a310.5m to the film business. Useful links: \u0095 Russian film sites \u0095 Russian cinema \u0095 Goskino",

Relatives of people who have been murdered and the parents of child victims will have the opportunity to put on record the anguish they have felt under the victim personal statement scheme, which will be announced by the home secretary, Jack Straw. The government hopes that the personal statements, which will be available to the courts, will give victims of crime a greater voice in the criminal justice system. A spokeswoman for the Home Office said last night: \"It will give the victims and their families a chance to say how the crime has affected them personally, whether it be physically, emotionally, psychologically or financially.\" Under the scheme, which will be operating in England and Wales from early next year, police will ask victims whether they want to make a personal statement at the same time as they take witness statements. If a victim declines the opportunity, he or she will be able to change their mind and make a statement at a later date. Victims will also be able to amend the statement if they suffer long-term effects from the crime. Although sentencing will be a matter for judges and magistrates, the statements will be available to defence and prosecution teams as well as other agencies involved in the case. The Home Office said people who ran small businesses would also be able to make statements about how they had suffered financially. Dame Helen Reeve, chief executive of Victim Support, welcomed the scheme. \"For the first time victims will be able to communicate directly with all the people dealing with their case,\" she said. \"They will be able to have their own interests considered by asking for the compensation, support, or protection they need.\" The scheme falls short of \"impact statements\" made by victims of crime in the United States, where they can request specific sentences.

So why was yesterday morning's arrest being taken so seriously? There are few genuine clues.</p> <p>One, perhaps, is more significant than the others.</p> <p>Detective Chief Inspector Hamish Campbell, the man leading the Jill Dando murder hunt, is not an excitable sort of chap.</p> <p>But, according to his colleagues, he was excited yesterday. Scotland Yard sources said he had reason to be. Translated into plain English, this is police-speak for: \"Hamish might have got his man.\"</p> <p>Few murder inquiries in recent memory have put as much pressure on a detective or his squad. Ch Insp Campbell is, however, a methodical and patient officer who has not allowed the strain to deflect him from a sincere belief that the murder on April 26 last year could be solved. The 13-month-old inquiry has had several phases, which have ultimately taken him full circle.</p> <p>Initial theories were that Ms Dando, 37, was targeted by a stalker or obsessive. A man carrying a mobile phone was seen loitering in Gowan Avenue just before she died, and witnesses remembered seeing someone running away from the scene shortly after Ms Dando screamed. This prime suspect has never been identified and as days passed, the picture of what happened in the road that morning became increasingly blurred. A Range Rover car was spotted parked in Gowan Avenue, and a similar car was seen speeding from the area. Other witnesses spoke of a sweating man at a bus stop. Despite repeated appeals, some of the men and women who were in Gowan Avenue that morning - they couldn't all have been involved in the murder - did not come forward to be eliminated as suspects.</p> <p>\"There were 23 sightings, yet none of these men have come forward!\" Ch Insp Campbell told the Guardian in exasperation. \"Why not? As I sit here in the middle of this storm, I think that is pretty extraordinary.\"</p> <p>Ms Dando's involvement in the Crimewatch programme could not be dismissed as a possible motive, though Ch Insp Campbell was never happy with that thesis. The war in Kosovo and the possibility that Ms Dando might have been killed in a revenge assassination for the Nato bombing of a Serbian television station, was also floated in the media. Faced with a mass of conflicting evidence, no eyewitnesses, no motive and no strong leads, Ch Insp Campbell had to, in effect, start the whole inquiry from scratch, ruling nothing in, ruling nothing out.</p> <p>With new theories from unnamed and apparently ill-informed sources exploding around him all the time, he set his 45-strong murder squad on a huge \"fishing expedition\" for potential clues. During deadpan press conferences, he told the same story, apologising to reporters for not offering them anything more exciting or specific. He said his team was working on two theories: that Ms Dando was targeted by an obsessive or a contract killer, probably working with a small gang.</p> <p>They drew up a list of 400 suspects, which included men with a history of violence and mental illness. Among them were 40 or 50 known obsessives. They took more than 1,000 statements and saw 3,000 people. Officers gutted Ms Dando's filofax, which had the names of 486 friends, and scoured through 4,000 letters and messages sent to the incident room. They also read the 13,700 emails sent to the BBC. They asked mobile phone companies to try to identify the 10,000 calls made in west London on the morning she died. Newspapers swelled the reward for information leading to an arrest to \u00a3250,000. Psychological profiles were commissioned, gun experts from the UK, America and Russia tried and failed to identify the curious indentations - possibly made by a drawing pin - on the cartridge shell found at the scene. It was fired, experts said, from a semi-automatic 9mm pistol, but they could not tell the manufacturer.</p> <p>By process of careful elimination, Ch Insp Campbell decided earlier this year that the killer was most likely a loner, not a contract killer, and that the man's obsession may have been triggered to murderous intent by the publicity surrounding Ms Dando's engagement to Alan Farthing, a gynaecologist. His hunch was supported by evidence that Ms Dando was being stalked, albeit surreptitiously, in the months before she died.</p> <p>A man calling himself James Dando and claiming to be the presenter's brother, rang the gas, electricity and water companies in February last year to try to have her bills transferred into his name. Another man, who was found and ruled out of the inquiry, used the internet service 192.com to pinpoint exactly where Ms Dando lived; another caller to British Telecom seemed to have her ex-directory telephone number.</p> <p><b> Underworld</b><br></p> <p>There were other pointers. Despite the huge reward, nobody came forward from the underworld claiming knowledge of the killer. Ch Insp Campbell told the Guardian his officers had been laughed at by villains they had interviewed about the murder. \"The major criminals all say the same thing: 'Why would we want to do that? She was a newscaster who did holiday programmes. So why her?'\"</p> <p>Three men have been arrested in the course of the investigation, but they were released quickly and Scotland Yard sources quietly insisted that the developments were not significant. Ch Insp Campbell braced himself for scepticism, even derision, at the lack of progress on the anniversary of Ms Dando's death, but there was very little carping in the media. Ch Insp Campbell was certain that the killer would watch the Crimewatch appeal to mark the occasion, and might even give himself up. Failing that, he hoped that someone who knew the killer might come forward.</p> <p>\"Someone knows who he is,\" said a source. \"They might not realise it, but they do. We need a bit of luck.\"</p> <p>They got it. Several weeks ago a fresh piece of information about a man whom they had not interviewed before was given to the murder squad, which is based in Kensington.</p> <p>A surveillance operation started which culminated at 6.30 yesterday morning, when officers raided the suspect's home and arrested him.</p> <p>Ch Insp Campbell does not give his feelings away cheaply.</p> <p>It remains to be seen if he really does have something to smile about. <br><br><b>High-flying detective with the worst job in British policing</b><br><br>The man in charge of one of the most high profile murder investigations ever faced by Scotland Yard, Detective Chief Inspector Hamish Campbell, has had everyone from the commissioner of the Metropolitan Police to the millions of Crimewatch viewers clamouring for a result.</p> <p>Until yesterday colleagues of all ranks agreed he had the worst job in British policing. But Ch Insp Campbell knows all about pressure for success, and while others suggested that the chances of catching Jill Dando's killer were fading, he never allowed that thought to pervade his attitude or that of his 45-strong team of detectives.</p> <p>An approachable man of Scottish descent and highly regarded by his senior officers, Ch Insp Campbell joined the police in 1974. A 21-year career in CID has included stints at the Yard's anti-terrorist branch and the ultra-secret criminal intelligence unit.</p> <p>Before the Dando investigation he was in charge of two other particularly baffling cases on his west London patch: the disappearance of Argentinian Gracia Morton in Kensington in November 1997 and the murder of Macedonian schoolgirl Katrina Koneva in Hammersmith in May of the same year.</p> <p>He was given the Dando case four months after being promoted to the Yard's elite group of special investigating officers, who receive special training to run and control major cases.</p> <p>Credited by his colleagues as stubborn but with lots of stamina (he has cycled to Italy for charity), once a week he leaves his office in a building next to Kensington police station to work off his frustration on the judo mats.</p> <p>Colleagues describe him as a family man, but he has had little time to spend at home in the past 13 months, during which he has put in 13-hour days in the hunt for the television presenter's killer.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Detectives investigating Jill Dando's murder were questioning a suspect last night following the arrest of a 36-year-old man at his south London home, less than half a mile from where the television presenter was shot dead. Sources described the arrest as a \"highly significant\" development in an inquiry which began when Ms Dando was shot in the side of the head on the doorstep of her home in Gowan Avenue, Fulham, south-west London, 13 months ago. Scotland Yard refused to elaborate on the identity of the man being held. But neighbours named him as Barry Bulsara. Mr Bulsara lives alone in a raised ground-floor housing association flat in Crookham Road, Fulham, barely five minutes walk from Ms Dando's home. Four officers went to his flat at 6.30am yesterday and arrested him without a struggle. Sensitivity about the case is so acute that the police refused to elaborate on a bald statement issued 90 minutes after unarmed officers from the murder squad went to the flat and took him for questioning at Hammersmith police station. It said: \"Officers investigating the murder of Jill Dando have this morning arrested a man on suspicion of murder. He was arrested at about 6.30am and taken to a police station in London where he remains in custody.\" Neighbours said Mr Bulsara lived alone, after the end of his marriage to a Japanese woman. He did not work due to ill health. He told neighbours that he had served in the Territorial Army. He had also told friends that Freddie Mercury, the late singer with the group Queen, was his cousin. Freddie Mercury's real surname was Bulsara. One friend, Emiko Okoturo, 29, said Mr Bulsara had told him that he had information about Ms Dando's killer. A month ago Mr Bulsara complained to Mr Okoturo that the police had raided his flat, and a flat owned by his mother in Acton, west London. \"He told me they had searched the premises and he was really upset about it,\" said Mr Okoturo, a student. Last night, forensic experts were conducting a finger-tip search of Mr Bulsara's flat, packing dozens of crates to be taken away for examination. Police sources stressed the suspect had not been arrested before. However, Mr Bulsara's neighbours were adamant he had been seen by detectives about a month ago.

The 13-month-old inquiry has had several phases, which have ultimately taken him full circle. Initial theories were that Ms Dando, 37, was targeted by a stalker or obsessive. A man carrying a mobile phone was seen loitering in Gowan Avenue just before she died, and witnesses remembered seeing someone running away from the scene shortly after Ms Dando screamed. This prime suspect has never been identified and as days passed, the picture of what happened in the road that morning became increasingly blurred. A Range Rover car was spotted parked in Gowan Avenue, and a similar car was seen speeding from the area. Other witnesses spoke of a sweating man at a bus stop. Despite repeated appeals, some of the men and women who were in Gowan Avenue that morning - they couldn't all have been involved in the murder - did not come forward to be eliminated as suspects. \"There were 23 sightings, yet none of these men have come forward!\" Ch Insp Campbell told the Guardian in exasperation. \"Why not? As I sit here in the middle of this storm, I think that is pretty extraordinary.\" Ms Dando's involvement in the Crimewatch programme could not be dismissed as a possible motive, though Ch Insp Campbell was never happy with that thesis. The war in Kosovo and the possibility that Ms Dando might have been killed in a revenge assassination for the Nato bombing of a Serbian television station, was also floated in the media. Faced with a mass of conflicting evidence, no eyewitnesses, no motive and no strong leads, Ch Insp Campbell had to, in effect, start the whole inquiry from scratch, ruling nothing in, ruling nothing out. With new theories from unnamed and apparently ill-informed sources exploding around him all the time, he set his 45-strong murder squad on a huge \"fishing expedition\" for potential clues. During deadpan press conferences, he told the same story, apologising to reporters for not offering them anything more exciting or specific. He said his team was working on two theories: that Ms Dando was targeted by an obsessive or a contract killer, probably working with a small gang. They drew up a list of 400 suspects, which included men with a history of violence and mental illness. Among them were 40 or 50 known obsessives. They took more than 1,000 statements and saw 3,000 people. Officers gutted Ms Dando's filofax, which had the names of 486 friends, and scoured through 4,000 letters and messages sent to the incident room. They also read the 13,700 emails sent to the BBC. They asked mobile phone companies to try to identify the 10,000 calls made in west London on the morning she died. Newspapers swelled the reward for information leading to an arrest to \u00a3250,000. Psychological profiles were commissioned, gun experts from the UK, America and Russia tried and failed to identify the curious indentations - possibly made by a drawing pin - on the cartridge shell found at the scene. It was fired, experts said, from a semi-automatic 9mm pistol, but they could not tell the manufacturer. By process of careful elimination, Ch Insp Campbell decided earlier this year that the killer was most likely a loner, not a contract killer, and that the man's obsession may have been triggered to murderous intent by the publicity surrounding Ms Dando's engagement to Alan Farthing, a gynaecologist. His hunch was supported by evidence that Ms Dando was being stalked, albeit surreptitiously, in the months before she died. A man calling himself James Dando and claiming to be the presenter's brother, rang the gas, electricity and water companies in February last year to try to have her bills transferred into his name. Another man, who was found and ruled out of the inquiry, used the internet service 192.com to pinpoint exactly where Ms Dando lived; another caller to British Telecom seemed to have her ex-directory telephone number. Underworld There were other pointers. Despite the huge reward, nobody came forward from the underworld claiming knowledge of the killer. Ch Insp Campbell told the Guardian his officers had been laughed at by villains they had interviewed about the murder. \"The major criminals all say the same thing: 'Why would we want to do that? She was a newscaster who did holiday programmes. So why her?'\" Three men have been arrested in the course of the investigation, but they were released quickly and Scotland Yard sources quietly insisted that the developments were not significant. Ch Insp Campbell braced himself for scepticism, even derision, at the lack of progress on the anniversary of Ms Dando's death, but there was very little carping in the media. Ch Insp Campbell was certain that the killer would watch the Crimewatch appeal to mark the occasion, and might even give himself up. Failing that, he hoped that someone who knew the killer might come forward. \"Someone knows who he is,\" said a source. \"They might not realise it, but they do. We need a bit of luck.\" They got it. Several weeks ago a fresh piece of information about a man whom they had not interviewed before was given to the murder squad, which is based in Kensington. A surveillance operation started which culminated at 6.30 yesterday morning, when officers raided the suspect's home and arrested him. Ch Insp Campbell does not give his feelings away cheaply. It remains to be seen if he really does have something to smile about. High-flying detective with the worst job in British policing The man in charge of one of the most high profile murder investigations ever faced by Scotland Yard, Detective Chief Inspector Hamish Campbell, has had everyone from the commissioner of the Metropolitan Police to the millions of Crimewatch viewers clamouring for a result. Until yesterday colleagues of all ranks agreed he had the worst job in British policing. But Ch Insp Campbell knows all about pressure for success, and while others suggested that the chances of catching Jill Dando's killer were fading, he never allowed that thought to pervade his attitude or that of his 45-strong team of detectives. An approachable man of Scottish descent and highly regarded by his senior officers, Ch Insp Campbell joined the police in 1974. A 21-year career in CID has included stints at the Yard's anti-terrorist branch and the ultra-secret criminal intelligence unit. Before the Dando investigation he was in charge of two other particularly baffling cases on his west London patch: the disappearance of Argentinian Gracia Morton in Kensington in November 1997 and the murder of Macedonian schoolgirl Katrina Koneva in Hammersmith in May of the same year. He was given the Dando case four months after being promoted to the Yard's elite group of special investigating officers, who receive special training to run and control major cases. Credited by his colleagues as stubborn but with lots of stamina (he has cycled to Italy for charity), once a week he leaves his office in a building next to Kensington police station to work off his frustration on the judo mats. Colleagues describe him as a family man, but he has had little time to spend at home in the past 13 months, during which he has put in 13-hour days in the hunt for the television presenter's killer.",

A forceful denunciation of the state of relations between the Liberal Democrats and Labour, written by former advisers closely linked to the leadership of both parties, argues that voters are ahead of politicians in wanting to see a \"more adult relationship\" between political parties. Opponents of co-operation are warned that tactical voting delivered both parties significant numbers of seats in the 1997 general election, and that - if the tactical vote does not materialise next time - the Labour majority would plummet to less than 60 even if the Conservatives fail to win a single extra vote. The broadside, in a New Statesman article by former Gordon Brown adviser and leading Blairite Neal Lawson, and Neil Sherlock, an aide to ex-Lib Dem leader Paddy Ashdown, will infuriate the significant grouping of Labour MPs opposed to the Lib-Lab \"project\". The level of opposition among many party traditionalists will be clear at Labour's autumn conference, where the party leadership is anticipating a battle over whether to renew the manifesto commitment to a referendum on voting reform for Westminister elections. The commitment is regarded by the Lib Dems as a minimum demand if cooperation with Labour is to continue. Calling on their parties to \"sink their differences\", the two aides urge moves to resume progress towards Mr Blair's professed vision of a \"progressive 21st century\" dominated by a united centre-left. They say: \"To achieve the prize of a progressive century, we have to give up the winner takes all approach of Westminster.\" There is a \"yawning gap\" between expectations and achievements on issues from health and education to welfare reform, they warn, arguing that the gap can be closed only by the sense of vision created by greater co-operation. While not calling for merger or a formal pact, they propose greater co-operation to defeat the Tories on issues such as social justice and Europe.",

Nick Hardwick, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said the figures showed that half of all asylum decisions in April resulted in Britain giving protection to people fleeing human rights abuses. \"These figures prove that a much higher proportion of asylum seekers are given protection than is generally acknowledged - even by the Home Office where the decisions are made,\" he said. \"What is also clear is that that the harsh decision to force asylum seekers to live on vouchers instead of benefits does not seem to have had an impact on the number of people arriving here. \"But do we want the impact of other recent changes in legislation, such as fines on lorries, to prevent those desperately in need of sanctuary from actually reaching our shores?\"",

Operation Litani, the name the Israelis gave their 1978 incursion, was to be followed in June 1982 by a full-scale invasion that took their troops to Beirut and led to the Sabra and Shatilla massacres, and the expulsion of the PLO from Lebanon. After that came countless other ground actions, bombings, and shellings as spring followed spring in southern Lebanon. Somehow, in spite of it all, the wheat continued to be sown and harvested, an example of human obduracy from which the Israelis should have learned a lesson. The Israeli record in Lebanon illustrated again and again that military power is often an illusory currency which a state can spend and spend without permanent gain or result.</p> <p>Israel in its early years was a country bent only on survival. The fortunes of war then brought it control over the West Bank, Gaza, and the Sinai, and from this position of widened power, Israel launched an ambitious attempt to remake the Middle East in a way more suited to her interests. The Lebanese entrapment, as Israelis came to see it, was just one aspect of a broader imprisonment as Israel, aware that these larger designs were foundering, nevertheless continued to find it hugely difficult to abandon the positions which it had occupied in pursuit of them.</p> <p>Twenty years ago Menachem Begin, the Likud prime minister, had taken up Anwar Sadat's offer of peace, but not, it swiftly turned out, as a stepping stone to agreements with Israel's other enemies. Instead he moved to confront them, first diluting his commitment to Palestinian autonomy, on which Sadat had set such store, then annexing the Golan Heights, and then allowing his defence minister, Ariel Sharon, to invade Lebanon with the object of destroying the PLO. The grand plan, at least for Sharon, did not end there. Sharon's hope was to change Lebanon into a Maronite-run satellite and then, by shifting Palestinians into Jordan, to bring about the fall of that kingdom and its replacement by a Palestinian state, into which much of the West Bank and Gaza population could be decanted. This mad scheme was soon in ruins, but in a way the retreat from it ended only yesterday, when the last Israeli soldiers pulled out.</p> <p>Even before these developments, Sadat, in one of his meetings in Cairo with the Israeli ambassador, had been so angered by Begin's growing betrayal of their compact that he kept repeating: \"May God forgive you, O Menachem!\" Avi Shlaim, the Israeli historian who records this incident in his compelling survey of Israel's relationship with the Arabs over the last half-century, shows how Begin took a course in 1981 and 1982 whose disastrous consequences are still apparent today.</p> <p>It is also to be recorded that many Israeli politicians, officials and soldiers were doubtful or opposed, but, as so often in that nation's history, did not prevail. Even Begin was misled by the wilful Sharon and came to regret the Lebanon war deeply.</p> <p>Yet what was done was done. The decision, in spite of his promises to Sadat, to refuse any meaningful autonomy or self-government to the Palestinians has shaped Likud policy, and influenced that of the Labour party, up to Netanyahu and beyond. The decision to annex the Golan set the hostile relationship with Syria in concrete and helped create a proxy theatre of war in southern Lebanon. The invasion of Lebanon brought into being a political and military force, Hizbullah, that over the years became a much more effective foe than the PLO had been on that front. Hizbullah turned out to be so tough, in fact, that Israel's surrogate, the Christian militia it supported, could not manage on its own. More and more the Israelis had to steel themselves to the steady loss of their own young men.</p> <p>The story of Israel and the Middle East in the past two decades has been of halting and painful attempts to reverse the Israeli decisions of the early 80s. They were, in Yehoshafat Harkabi's phrase, \"fateful\" decisions, and showed, as that astute former head of Israeli military intelligence remarked, that Israel was not so much a victim of others as it was of its own illusions. Through all this time Israelis have shown a growing awareness that their policies are in the long term untenable, infuriatingly combined with a refusal to pay the necessary price for peace. Oslo allowed progress toward agreement with the Palestinians to begin. That progress, however, was undermined by Binyamin Netanyahu, perhaps the supreme example of the Israeli tendency to believe that peace can be secured without concessions. But then came Ehud Barak, and many, in Israel and abroad, thought he carried with him the key to final settlements with the Palestinians, the Syrians and the Lebanese. It seemed that at last the mischief of 1981 and 1982 would be undone.</p> <p>But Barak has proved to be a conjuror who, as the Israeli columnist Nahum Barnea has written, constantly suggested he could do the trick, but never actually did it. Trying to balance an undisciplined coalition, he could not offer Syria the complete restitution of territory in the Golan that President Assad, for his own compelling political reasons, naturally demanded. Resolving nevertheless to go ahead with his promise to get the boys out of Lebanon, but now without agreement with the Syrians or the Lebanese, he saw the withdrawal degenerate into a run for the border. Israel's Christian allies, about to be abandoned without even a half-baked deal on their future, not unexpectedly started to fold and, with no buffer left, the Israelis had to get out fast.</p> <p>The scuttle in prospect had already pumped up Palestinian street protest, at a high level anyway because Barak had left certain key concessions too late. The Golan, the Lebanon, and the Palestinian lands are as interconnected today as they were in 1981. Lining them up again in a manageable sequence, a sequence in which agreement follows agreement until a general peace is attained, is not impossible, but it is not going to be easy.</p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"mailto:martin.woollacott@theguardian.com\">martin.woollacott@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Last week, I was up all hours writing pieces and being cross-questioned on the media about the revealing dress that TV presenter Carol Vorderman wore to the Bafta awards. Was it a major step forward for the socio-sexual self-confidence of the middle-aged woman? Or did it represent a woman being forced to conform to the male notion of youthful sexuality?</p> <p>Seven days later, already the whole issue of Ms Vorderman and her dress seems very pass\u00e9, very mid-May 2000. Who was Carol Vorderman, and why were we worried sick about that dress of hers? No one can remember. We as a society have moved on since those tortured days of last week and the problems we wish to grapple with are very, very different. So I turn to the file labelled \"Blair Baby - Issues, Problems and Solutions\", knowing that once again the media will be beating a path to my door for my thoughts-in-progress.</p> <p>Will Cherie breastfeed baby Leo? And, if she does, will she be running the risk of reducing him to a lifetime of subconscious mother-dependency, perhaps resulting in psychological turmoil, leading to a complete nervous breakdown, in his mid-to-late twenties? On the other hand, she might opt to bottle-feed him, in which case she should be made aware that breast-denial can prove to be a major - and in some cases terminal - source of trauma among middle-income males in their early thirties. But please, Cherie, on no account mix the bottle and the breast - many of those whose mothers attempted this method in the early 60s are now irreparably damaged as fully functional members of society.</p> <p>Leo's toys might also prove a major problem. Many commentators and experts, including myself, will be scouring the first photographs of young Leo Blair for any sign that he is already being encouraged to play with handguns, real or simulated. Certainly, I will be the first to criticise Tony and Cherie if I catch the tell-tale glint of a Magnum 45 in their baby's hands. At less than a week old, he will be frankly far too young to be entrusted with a loaded handgun of any type, and anyone (even the prime minister) who places a pump-action pistol in infant hands must expect to be roundly condemned as thoroughly irresponsible.</p> <p>Having a baby is, of course, the In Thing. It now seems likely that Cherie got the idea from reading about Liam Gallagher and Patsy Kensit and their baby son Lennon in the newspapers. But should a top legal brain be so influenced by the vagaries of fashion? Is it not wholly irresponsible of the wife of a serving prime minister to have a baby just because a pop star has had one? It is now widely accepted in political circles that Cherie named the baby after top 70s singer Leo Sayer, whose hits include Home Again, Naturally, and who is a frequent visitor to Number 10. Throughout this week, Cherie will have been on the telephone not only to Sayer but also to Patsy Kensit asking for tips, not only on the breastfeeding question but on a wide range of issues from selecting the most environmentally friendly nappies to whether to vaccinate immediately for whooping cough and diphtheria.</p> <p>But some decisions should be taken by both parents: GM foods, for instance. Should young Leo Blair be subjected from an early age foods with GM additives - or should his parents wait until tests have proved, one way or the other, whether they are safe? And though girls are more prone to anorexia than boys, every action should be taken by his parents to prevent young Leo from becoming a severe anorexic at any time after the age of seven or eight. Already it may be too late - if, by sticking over-rigidly to feeding times, Cherie has inculcated the notion of food as an emotional-psychological necessity in her infant, he may well bear the scars in 10 years' time.</p> <p>On an intensely personal note, I should confess that I myself have undergone the traumas suffered by infants at the hands of their parents. My mother now admits that she used to feed me milk chocolate regularly \"as a treat\" when I was just five years of age. Result? Aged 12, I was caught shoplifting. Aged 15, I was experiencing learning difficulties. Aged 16, I was bulimic. Aged 17, I was failing my maths O level for the 12th time. By 18, I was pregnant. And by the age of 35, my second marriage had broken up, leaving my children seriously dysfunctional. Thanks, mum: thanks a bloody lot.</p> <p>So let's hope Cherie hasn't already condemned Leo to a life of intractable personal guilt - including his own contribution to the worldwide population explosion. For further help, I would recommend my two baby manuals, You and Your New Problem, and Your Baby and You: Conflict Management.</p> <p>Next week: Mourning Dead Flowers: Coming to Terms with Garden Bereavement.</p>",

Already it may be too late - if, by sticking over-rigidly to feeding times, Cherie has inculcated the notion of food as an emotional-psychological necessity in her infant, he may well bear the scars in 10 years' time. On an intensely personal note, I should confess that I myself have undergone the traumas suffered by infants at the hands of their parents. My mother now admits that she used to feed me milk chocolate regularly \"as a treat\" when I was just five years of age. Result? Aged 12, I was caught shoplifting. Aged 15, I was experiencing learning difficulties. Aged 16, I was bulimic. Aged 17, I was failing my maths O level for the 12th time. By 18, I was pregnant. And by the age of 35, my second marriage had broken up, leaving my children seriously dysfunctional. Thanks, mum: thanks a bloody lot. So let's hope Cherie hasn't already condemned Leo to a life of intractable personal guilt - including his own contribution to the worldwide population explosion. For further help, I would recommend my two baby manuals, You and Your New Problem, and Your Baby and You: Conflict Management.

The tactical high energy laser system has been specifically designed to shoot down katyusha and other short-range missiles of the sort which the Hizbullah movement has repeatedly used in the past to attack Israel's northern towns and villages. The latest tests of the limited range combat laser - the world's first - began this week at the White Sands missile range in New Mexico, but were interrupted by a faulty mirror on the laser. The crucial mid-air shoot-down phase, which will include the destruction of a single katyusha and will be followed by tests involving the destruction of multiple missiles, has now been postponed until June. \"The single rocket shoot-down is the most critical, because it will once and for all show that we've been able to design and develop a bona fide high-powered laser system,\" the US army programme manager, Gerald Wilson, said. The system concentrates a high intensity beam on the incoming rocket, subjecting it to temperatures many times higher than the surface of the sun. \"Not too many substances known by mankind can withstand that,\" Mr Wilson said.

Deployment of the laser weapons to defend frequently attacked northern Israeli communities such as Kiryat Shmona is seen as a decisive new military advantage in Israel's favour, as the struggle on the Lebanon border shifts from troops to technology. The Israeli defence ministry said earlier this month that it would deploy the system along the northern border. \"It is a system that is designed specifically to deal with katyusha rocket attacks from across the border,\" a Pentagon spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, said this week. The weapon has the capacity to deliver up to 60 laser beam shots without reloading. The beams can be moved around at will to defend against multiple targets, the designers say.

A hefty slice of Britain's brewing industry is on the way to mainland Europe - Whitbread yesterday sold its manufacturing operations to Belgian multinational Interbrew and Bass is likely to announce a similar exit within weeks. </p> <p>The implications for the traditional pint are not good. </p> <p>All the companies concerned ruminated at length on the importance of global brands. Stella Artois and Carling are definitely in, Old Speckled Chicken's Finger is out. </p> <p>Sales of real ale have been declining for years, faced with an onslaught of trendy commercials promoting premium lager brands.

      "bodyText": "Global brands land bitter blow The days of spinsters cycling to the pub through the morning mist for a pint of warm cloudy ale could be numbered. A hefty slice of Britain's brewing industry is on the way to mainland Europe - Whitbread yesterday sold its manufacturing operations to Belgian multinational Interbrew and Bass is likely to announce a similar exit within weeks. The implications for the traditional pint are not good. All the companies concerned ruminated at length on the importance of global brands. Stella Artois and Carling are definitely in, Old Speckled Chicken's Finger is out. Sales of real ale have been declining for years, faced with an onslaught of trendy commercials promoting premium lager brands. Local beers are rarely on offer in the city centre bars which are luring drinkers away from neighbourhood boozers. For Interbrew, Carlsberg-Tetley and even Scottish &amp; Newcastle - which is buying Kronenbourg's manufacturer Groupe Danone - the only way forward is to develop global products with equal appeal in Birmingham and Beijing. Sheer size is critical to fund massive advertising blitzes - even a sizeable national player cannot compete with the promotional budgets behind Heineken and Carlsberg. Prices have also come under pressure - despite Whitbread's claim that Stella is \"reassuringly expensive\", the market leaders are pitching their offerings increasingly competitively - which is good news for lager fans but means a squeeze for smaller producers. There was a cry of pain yesterday from the Independent Family Brewers of Britain - tellingly, the organisation only has 34 remaining members. It forecast more brewery closures - and there have been many already in the last year, most notably the Vaux brewery in Sunderland and Morland's Old Speckled Hen site in Abingdon. Interbrew's chief executive Hugo Powell insisted that he would continue producing Whitbread's local ales yesterday, but it is hard to see the Belgian group maintaining a long-term commitment to the likes of Fuggles Imperial, Welsh Smooth and Castle Eden Ale. Whitbread's three main sites should be safe as they can continue to pump out volume lager, but fans of Fuggles should consider stocking up. Odd game Strange tactics yesterday from Focus Do It All as it pursues its \u00a3327m bid for rival DIY chain Wickes, with the predator indicating it would not sell the 29.9% stake it has bought in Wickes if its bid fails. The move will keep alive hopes of a bid at a later date as well as removing the prospect of a large chunk of Wickes' shares suddenly being unloaded onto the market. As a result Wickes shareholders would seem to have little to lose if they stay with their present management team and its recovery plans. Shareholders will benefit if the Wickes management delivers the goods, and will probably be bailed out by Focus if it does not. The offer closes on June 2, but while both sides claim to speak for 30% of the shares, the bidder is already talking like a frustrated loser - which is why shares in Wickes are now sitting at a 7% discount to the cash on the table.

Nationalists have reacted angrily, saying that the changes fall outside the Good Friday agreement which set up the Patten report. Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the SDLP, has claimed there are 44 differences between the government's policing legislation and Patten's report. The main differences are: Force's name The government is watering down Patten's proposal to abolish the name of the RUC. Patten said the Royal Ulster Constabulary should be named the Northern Ireland Police Service. But the government is proposing to keep the RUC's name alive in by saying that the new force incorporates the RUC. It is leaving the final decision on the name to the Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson. Mr Mandelson said: \"I believe that the sensible way forward is to provide a legal description in the bill which incorporates the Royal Ulster Constabulary, in effect the title deeds of the new service, while introducing a new name that will be used for all working and operational purposes.

No they don't: most simply wait to troop through the lobbies to vote.</p> <p>A number of Labour MPs, and our wives, tried to change the hours of the Commons to 9am to 7pm in the 1970s. We failed: first because Labour MPs who represented constituencies outside London (most of them) were nervous about being at a loose end in London at night and worried that their families and constituents would think they were exposed to temptation. Secondly, because a large number of MPs (mostly Conservative) wanted to earn money in the courts and the City in the mornings.<br><b>John Garrett</b><br>Norwich</p> <p>\u0095 As the first British Asian woman MEP, I have a good deal of sympathy for Trevor Phillips' comments on ethnic minority MP targets (Activists demand better race balance in Commons, May 25) for there is a need for greater representation within our party. Nonetheless, it is a sad reflection on British politics that the Labour party is the only one to have a black member on the Greater London Assembly.</p> <p>Despite the 101 women MPs, despite the increasing numbers of black politicians working hard for the people of Britain - we cannot afford to be complacent. Forward thinking policy is reflected in the emerging numbers of black people we see in Westminster today and nearly 1,000 local black councillors across the UK. Nevertheless, there is still all to play for, we can take nothing for granted.</p> <p>It is our duty, as members of a party devoted to equal opportunities, to work together for positive action. Positive action - based on merit - has worked before and it can work again, not only for women and black people, but for other groups we have not yet targeted.</p> <p>But positive action does not begin and end at the door of central policy.

      "bodyText": "Oona King (Male members, May 19) says that MPs routinely discuss legislation affecting millions in the middle of the night. No they don't: most simply wait to troop through the lobbies to vote. A number of Labour MPs, and our wives, tried to change the hours of the Commons to 9am to 7pm in the 1970s. We failed: first because Labour MPs who represented constituencies outside London (most of them) were nervous about being at a loose end in London at night and worried that their families and constituents would think they were exposed to temptation. Secondly, because a large number of MPs (mostly Conservative) wanted to earn money in the courts and the City in the mornings. John Garrett Norwich \u0095 As the first British Asian woman MEP, I have a good deal of sympathy for Trevor Phillips' comments on ethnic minority MP targets (Activists demand better race balance in Commons, May 25) for there is a need for greater representation within our party. Nonetheless, it is a sad reflection on British politics that the Labour party is the only one to have a black member on the Greater London Assembly. Despite the 101 women MPs, despite the increasing numbers of black politicians working hard for the people of Britain - we cannot afford to be complacent. Forward thinking policy is reflected in the emerging numbers of black people we see in Westminster today and nearly 1,000 local black councillors across the UK. Nevertheless, there is still all to play for, we can take nothing for granted. It is our duty, as members of a party devoted to equal opportunities, to work together for positive action. Positive action - based on merit - has worked before and it can work again, not only for women and black people, but for other groups we have not yet targeted. But positive action does not begin and end at the door of central policy. At present there are a number of black candidates on the approved parliamentary list. Here is a real opportunity for the wider membership, through party constituencies, to take responsibility on the ground, choose more black candidates and effect real change. Neena Gill MEP \u0095 Surely the selection procedure in Tottenham has yet again thrown up a classic example of Millbank imposing a member of the fragrant barristocracy that controls New Labour upon one of England's most deprived constituencies (Bernie Grant's legacy: Politics, race and the fight to inherit, May 25). James Randolph London james_randolph@hotmail.com \u0095 The real issues for voters should be the dire performance of Haringey council, which Grant lead for two years before entering the Commons in 1987. Policies from that period have created some of the worst poverty and crime in Britain. Neville Collins Tottenham, London NevilleJulian@aol.com",

      "body": "<p>The vote in the US Congress to normalise trade relations with China is a watershed event whose huge significance stretches far beyond the confines of Capitol Hill. It is also an enormous, two-way gamble. The decision has its roots, in an historical sense, in the crude efforts of 19th-century European powers to expand and control the China trade by gunboat diplomacy and unequal treaties. It is the lineal descendant of Deng Xiaoping's cautious opening to the west a generation ago. Right now, it can be seen as a signal victory for Presidents Bill Clinton and Jiang Zemin who, for different reasons, had much riding on this vote. In the immediate future, and following a similar agreement with the European Union last week, it paves the way for China's accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO), dramatic tariff reductions (especially in hi-tech products), a surge in foreign investment, and unprecedented access to China's 1.3bn consumers. But in the longer term, the decision is likely to have fundamental consequences for China's political organisation, society and culture, and for US strategic, economic and military global dominance. It potentially makes of China the superpower which it believes itself to be by right and destiny, with all the good and bad that may entail. It is a decision which will eventually touch all our lives.</p> <p>China's leaders prefer to view WTO membership, first and last, as a wholly economic breakthrough. In the limited sense that increased trade can bring increased prosperity, they are right. Internally, the decision is also a triumph for reformers over communist hardliners and ideologues. But the impact on China's already ailing state monopolies, its heavy industry, its peasant agriculture, and on the urban and rural workforce, is likely to be highly dislocating - and very risky. Rising consumer expectations, greater affluence, freer conventional and electronic information flows, increased labour mobility, and deeper exposure to western culture will have an incalculable, unavoidable effect on political discourse. China yesterday angrily rejected renewed US attempts to link freer trade to human rights monitoring. But the present-day activities of dissidents may soon seem like very small beer for rulers faced by an entire population rapidly awakening to the possibilities of individual as well as collective advancement, demanding the right to speak out as well as to buy and sell, and wanting to choose what they do, where they go, and who leads them. Encapsulated in this week's decision may lie the seeds of final oblivion for China's 50-year-old communist era.</p> <p>For America and the west, the Chinese market, despite many disappointments, remains a sort of business Shangri-la.

      "bodyText": "The vote in the US Congress to normalise trade relations with China is a watershed event whose huge significance stretches far beyond the confines of Capitol Hill. It is also an enormous, two-way gamble. The decision has its roots, in an historical sense, in the crude efforts of 19th-century European powers to expand and control the China trade by gunboat diplomacy and unequal treaties. It is the lineal descendant of Deng Xiaoping's cautious opening to the west a generation ago. Right now, it can be seen as a signal victory for Presidents Bill Clinton and Jiang Zemin who, for different reasons, had much riding on this vote. In the immediate future, and following a similar agreement with the European Union last week, it paves the way for China's accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO), dramatic tariff reductions (especially in hi-tech products), a surge in foreign investment, and unprecedented access to China's 1.3bn consumers. But in the longer term, the decision is likely to have fundamental consequences for China's political organisation, society and culture, and for US strategic, economic and military global dominance. It potentially makes of China the superpower which it believes itself to be by right and destiny, with all the good and bad that may entail. It is a decision which will eventually touch all our lives. China's leaders prefer to view WTO membership, first and last, as a wholly economic breakthrough. In the limited sense that increased trade can bring increased prosperity, they are right. Internally, the decision is also a triumph for reformers over communist hardliners and ideologues. But the impact on China's already ailing state monopolies, its heavy industry, its peasant agriculture, and on the urban and rural workforce, is likely to be highly dislocating - and very risky. Rising consumer expectations, greater affluence, freer conventional and electronic information flows, increased labour mobility, and deeper exposure to western culture will have an incalculable, unavoidable effect on political discourse. China yesterday angrily rejected renewed US attempts to link freer trade to human rights monitoring. But the present-day activities of dissidents may soon seem like very small beer for rulers faced by an entire population rapidly awakening to the possibilities of individual as well as collective advancement, demanding the right to speak out as well as to buy and sell, and wanting to choose what they do, where they go, and who leads them. Encapsulated in this week's decision may lie the seeds of final oblivion for China's 50-year-old communist era. For America and the west, the Chinese market, despite many disappointments, remains a sort of business Shangri-la. The idea of selling cars to all those cyclists (whatever the consequences for global warming) leaves hard-faced Detroit motormen slavering with anticipation. There is altruism, too. Many sincerely believe with Mike Moore, the WTO chief, that a rule-based trading system is the key to global felicity. Why should the Chinese people be excluded? But for all its confidence in the self-fortifying power of unfettered capitalism, the US is also plunging deep into the unknown.

      "bodyText": "The government is considering another substantial increase in money for organic farming after being presented with \"comprehensive\" evidence that it supports far more wildlife than conventional farming. Michael Meacher, environment minister, yesterday said there was a question over funding - even though state aid in England is to double from \u00a311.5m a year to \u00a323m by 2004 - and hinted that further sums would be announced in the summer. He commended evidence from research over the past 13 years, compiled by organic flag-bearers, the Soil Association, which concluded that farms using their methods grew five times more wild plants and 57 extra species than other farms; had up to 44% more birds, including twice as many breeding skylarks; and 1.6 times more insects and invertebrates, which provide food for birds. The material was drawn from 23 research projects, mainly in southern lowlands, funded from sources including the government. Campaigners for organic farming presented the material after Elliot Morley, minister for the countryside, urged them to provide concrete, rather than anecdotal, evidence of benefits. The results, and ministers' reactions, were a boost for campaigners after rows between scientists over whether organic food is safer or better for people than conventionally grown crops and livestock. Mr Meacher said the association's report set out evidence \"comprehensively, forcibly and effectively\", and he gave strong hints of extra funds. Tony Blair has set a target of 9% of farmland to be using organic methods by 2006, three times present levels, but many MPs do not think this is enough. Mr Meacher was careful not to criticise Mr Blair but said: \"This is an acutely important issue the government must continue to review, and will. There is no question that organic farming is good for biodiversity, good for the natural countryside, good for the whole web of life.\" He delighted the organic lobby further by noting: \"There is no denying there are some aspects of intensive agriculture which have had a devastating impact in and around our fields.\" The government was still considering measures to limit the use of pesticides, despite its shelving of plans for a pesticides tax due to the parlous state of agriculture generally.

The money will be diverted from payments which the train operating companies are committed to making to the Treasury over the next 10 years. Officials at the shadow strategic rail authority (SSRA) confirmed yesterday that the government had given \"a nod and a wink\" to the plan, which is expected to be announced during the summer. The arrangement affects Virgin Trains, which is committed to paying back \u00a31bn to the Treasury between 2003 and 2011. This is because it operates what is thought to be the most lucrative franchise in Britain, the west coast line route between London, Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow. But the Virgin service is not expected to become profitable until after 2002, by which time its tilting trains should be operating on the Manchester to London route with a journey time of less than two hours. The deputy prime minister, John Prescott, is hoping to squeeze extra funds out of the chancellor, Gordon Brown, in the public spending round. Mr Prescott wants to announce details in July, but he is still in negotiations with the chancellor. Mr Prescott was unable to reveal anything to the industry at a national rail summit, attended by Railtrack, the train companies and the unions. His message to passengers was that he was on their side, and would always put safety above punctuality. The rail regulator, Tom Winsor, told the summit that he was acting to prevent Railtrack selling railway land for commercial purposes if he thought that it was required for rail purposes. He has written to 70 planning authorities throughout Britain asking if they have received applications from Railtrack seeking permission to develop land for commercial purposes. He said that he had been forced to send the letters because Railtrack had refused to give him the information. Mr Winsor is investigating the exploitation of railway land by the company after intervening in a case at his own station, Staplehurst, Kent. Railtrack wanted to sell land by the station for a supermarket, but the local train operating company, Connex, is planning to build a car park. Mr Winsor intervened because he can use his powers to keep the land for rail use. He said: \"Rail land must be protected against exploitation. I am taking this matter very seriously.\" Mike Grant, chief executive of the SSRA, said that it was proposing to compensate commuters with instant cash refunds if trains ran more than 30 minutes late. Monthly and yearly ticket season holders are refunded for poor performance when a yearly average of punctuality is taken into account. Every year 75,000 trains run at least 30 minutes late. The Rail Passengers' Council issues a report today showing that passengers using \"turn up and go\" fares are paying much more than travellers on protected fares. Its chairman, Stewart Francis, said rail fare increases were above inflation. \"Rail companies often raise unregulated fares by far more than the rate of inflation to compensate for lower regulated fares.\"",

      "bodyText": "Members of a Jewish reform synagogue in north London have split over a decision to reject the appointment of a lesbian rabbi. Accusations of bigotry and prejudice have followed the decision in the Finchley reform synagogue, the fifth largest reform synagogue in the country and one of the Jewish community's progressive powerbases. Moves to appoint Melinda Carr were narrowly defeated following a heated meeting of the 800 strong community. Although Ms Carr, who has made no secret of her sexuality and is a rabbi at the smaller Ealing and East Anglia liberal synagogues, was unanimously recommended by the Finchley reform council, at the meeting she fell seven votes short of the two-thirds majority required. In a letter to today's Jewish Chronicle a former member of the synagogue, Danny Burkeman, said: \"Finchley reform has chosen to ignore the main principles of reform Judaism in favour of supporting bigoted and prejudiced views.\" Mandy King, chairwoman of the synagogue, told the Guardian yesterday: \"Some [were] concerned that [Ms Carr] was South African and as we already had an American rabbi that meant there would not be a British presence.

      "bodyText": "A British air accident investigator has told the Lockerbie trial there was a significant mathematical error in the official report on the disaster which could seriously undermine the crown's case that a bomb actually exploded inside a luggage container in the plane's cargo bay. Christopher Protheroe, a senior inspector with the air accident investigation branch, said he informed prosecution lawyers in a meeting on Monday that a formula used to calculate blast wave effects after an initial explosion had been incorrectly applied in the 1990 AAIB report. Mr Protheroe admitted under cross examination from defence lawyer. Richard Keen that correct calculation of the so-called \"mach stem\" phenomenon would indicate that the bomb which destroyed Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland went off closer to its fuselage skin than originally thought. The prosecution alleges that Abdel Basset al-Megrahi and Al-Amin Khalifa Fahima, working as Libyan intelligence agents, planted a bomb in an unaccompanied suitcase in Malta which was eventually loaded onto the doomed aircraft in London. If the defence is able to create doubt that the bomb actually exploded inside a luggage container in the plane's cargo bay, it would be a serious blow to the crown's case. The AAIB report indicated that damage discernible in debris from the forward cargo hold of the plane showed that the distance would have been about 25 inches (63 cm). Mr Protheroe said in his testimony on Thursday that the distance, if calculated correctly, would be around 12 inches (30 cm). The crash killed all 259 people aboard and 11 people on the ground when flaming wreckage rained down on Lockerbie, Scotland, on the night of December 21, 1988. Mr Protheroe told the the specially built Scottish court in the Netherlands that he was not able to remember whether the crucial calculation in the final AAIB report had been carried out by his team or by outside experts in explosive effects commissioned by the board in the course of its investigation. \"At this point I'm not certain what is the reason for that error,\" Mr Protheroe said. Earlier, Mr Protheroe held up a model of the jumbo jet, with red, green and yellow patches showing how the plane had disintegrated in mid-air. Family members of the victims and of the Libyan defendants watched as he used the model and diagrams to illustrate the effects of the explosion. Outside the court, Jack Flynn, of New Jersey, who lost a 21-year-old son in the disaster, said that he had found that part of the testimony difficult to watch. \"What I was thinking about, when I saw those pictures of the wreckage reassembled on a hangar floor, was where my son had been sitting when that plane broke up,\" a tearful Mr Flynn said. As another AAIB investiga tor had done in his testimony on Wednesday, Mr Protheroe described how the blast initially blew a 20 by 20 inch (50 cm) hole in the fuselage and created further \"starburst fractures\" and \"petalling\" of the plane's metal skin from the subsequent explosion of hot gases. AAIB photographs produced in court of a partial three-dimensional reconstruction of the smashed plane showed clear evidence, Mr Protheroe said, of a \"shatter zone\" in the left front cargo bay almost di rectly under the second \"A\" in the Pan Am logo on the side of the jet's giant forward cabin. As the morning session ended, judges were considering a defence request that a full size reconstruction of a damaged cargo container be allowed into courtroom. Presiding judge Lord Sutherland asked that during the lunch break lawyers decide how that could be achieved and whether proceedings should be adjourned to allow the necessary work to be done. The hearing continues.",

If the proposal is agreed by health ministers of the member states of the European Union, 40% of the front of packets will be given over to warnings as well as half the space on the back. This would represent a massive defeat for the industry; it is currently obliged to cover 4% of the area of packets with warnings in Europe, and 6% in the UK. Nicotine and tar levels would have to be reduced, the MEPs propose, and manufacturers would be banned from describing their products as \"low tar\" or \"light\" or \"mild\". Minimising the impact of health warnings by placing them in a web of complicated and colourful graphics would not be allowed; warnings would have to be printed on a black and white background. Individual EU countries might be allowed to make manufacturers reproduce on their packets graphic pictures of smoking-related illnesses, as part of the proposal adopted by the European parliament's environment committee. Chris Davies, Liberal Democrat MEP for the north-west of England, proposed this amendment, and he said he believed yesterday's vote was of crucial importance. \"If people want to smoke, that's their right.

      "bodyText": "Sir Paul McCartney was honoured as one of the greatest composers of all time yesterday after being given a fellowship by the British Academy of Composers and Songwriters at its annual Ivor Novello Awards in London. Sir Paul, 57, who in 1965 penned Yesterday, the world's most recorded track, was given a minute long standing ovation at the Grosvenor House Hotel as he received the accolade and said it was a great honour. BACS chairman, Guy Fletcher, said that Sir Paul had a \"major role in changing the course of British popular music\" and was \"an exemplary role model for young people the world over\". The musician said that he had been watching the movie Amadeus and the scenes of Mozart composing had brought home his own role in creating music. \"I remember welling up and thinking: 'I'm one of them, I'm in that tradition,' maybe not like Mozart but I'm in that tradition. Everyone who's ever had a hit is so proud to be part of it. I'm pleased to be honoured with Lieber and Stoller, Elton, Travis and the Pet Shop Boys.\" He added: \"I remember coming here the very first time with my mates John, George and Ringo and sitting back there, just little kids we were, younger than my kids are now. \"It was just fantastic to be part of this whole songwriting thing. It was always just the greatest award, the greatest thing to get for songwriters and it still is many years later.\" Wearing a black smock coat with a large jewel tie pin, Sir Elton John presented an award to the Pet Shop Boys and said he was glad to see a gay band win musical recognition. \"I always seem to work with straight lyricists,\" he said, before making a crude reference to his own song Can You Feel My Love Tonight? Sir Elton who was rewarded for his contribution to the Lion King stage show, which took an award for international achievement in musical theatre, also launched a mock attack on Canadians for knocking Candle in the Wind from their top 10 chart. He said: \"I was feeling fucking depressed because my record had gone out of the top 10 for the first time in two and a half years in Canada. What a bunch of wankers those Canadians are. I thought I am never going to write another song.\" The Travis star, Fran Healy, was also celebrating after taking two titles. Travis's single Why Does it Always Rain on Me? won best contemporary song, while its author, Healy, was named songwriter of the year. Composers who won the accolades Best song musically and lyrically Strong, Robbie Williams Best contemporary song Why Does it Always Rain on Me?, Travis Best original music for TV or radio broadcast Trial by Fire, Richard Mitchell Best original film score The World is Not Enough, David Arnold The Ivors dance award Re-Rewind, Artful Dodger Performing Rights Society most performed workB eautiful Stranger, Madonna International hit of the year Genie in a Bottle, Christina Aguilera International achievement in musical theatre Composers of the Lion King including Sir Tim Rice and Sir Elton John PRS outstanding contribution to British music Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe (Pet Shop Boys) Jimmy Kennedy award Geoff Stephens Outstanding song collection Madness Songwriter of the year Fran Healy (Travis) Special international award Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller Academy fellowship Sir Paul McCartney",

If a terminal lid was lifted while a transaction was taking place - for example, when the printer jammed - the terminal would print the ticket as normal when the lid was closed, but would also send the same message again - creating a second, identical line of numbers on the central computer.</p> <p>If the numbers turned out a winner, the parallel phantom ticket would affect every prize greater than the \u00a310 fixed win, because all prize money is from a central pot. Mr Armitage told the programme: \"It was hard to believe something so serious had gone wrong.\"</p> <p>Camelot said it discovered only last week that a fault had been found two years ago in software supplied by GTech, a US-owned firm based in Watford, Hertfordshire. Camelot has run the lottery since its launch in November 1994 and is bidding to run it for the next seven years.</p> <p>Mr Armitage claimed that in 1998 managers at GTech looked at tracing winners who had lost out. \"We knew it would be complicated, and the meeting broke up without any decision. A week later I was told we wouldn't be doing anything. I was stunned.\"</p> <p>GTech declined to respond to this allegation, but confirmed the fault was identified in 1998. A spokesman said it was cooperating with the inquiry being conducted by Camelot and supervised by the lottery commission, and would not comment further until that was complete.</p>",

Mr Armitage told the programme \"hundreds of thousands\" of tickets had been involved. \"No one knows how much money has been affected,\" he said. \"All I can say is that, on every day I looked at, there were hundreds of phantom tickets recorded on the central computer - and the phantom tickets had definitely won prizes.\" In 1998 he traced the problem to the 27,000 lottery terminals in shops around the country, he said. If a terminal lid was lifted while a transaction was taking place - for example, when the printer jammed - the terminal would print the ticket as normal when the lid was closed, but would also send the same message again - creating a second, identical line of numbers on the central computer. If the numbers turned out a winner, the parallel phantom ticket would affect every prize greater than the \u00a310 fixed win, because all prize money is from a central pot. Mr Armitage told the programme: \"It was hard to believe something so serious had gone wrong.\" Camelot said it discovered only last week that a fault had been found two years ago in software supplied by GTech, a US-owned firm based in Watford, Hertfordshire. Camelot has run the lottery since its launch in November 1994 and is bidding to run it for the next seven years. Mr Armitage claimed that in 1998 managers at GTech looked at tracing winners who had lost out. \"We knew it would be complicated, and the meeting broke up without any decision. A week later I was told we wouldn't be doing anything. I was stunned.\" GTech declined to respond to this allegation, but confirmed the fault was identified in 1998. A spokesman said it was cooperating with the inquiry being conducted by Camelot and supervised by the lottery commission, and would not comment further until that was complete.",

Eritrea only came into being as an independent country in 1993, when it won independence from Ethiopia after a 30-year battle against emperor Haile Selassie and later the Soviet-backed government of Mengistu Haile Mariam. It remains to be seen what effect the loss of this war will have on the government of the country's founder, President Isaias Afwerki. A western diplomat in Addis Ababa said yesterday that it was too early to say definitively what the chances were of Mr Afwerki staying in power, but speculated that at present \"they don't look much better than 50:50\". \"At the moment, we're looking through a cracked crystal ball, but once the dust settles on this, both [Afwerki] and his administration will have a lot of questions [from the Eritrean people] to answer.\" While the political fallout from Ethiopia's victory remains difficult to predict, the obvious humanitarian consequences, already severe, look set to worsen. Even before this latest stage of the conflict erupted two weeks ago, some 300,000 Eritreans were in need of emergency food relief, and the latest Ethiopian offensive - which has reached deep into Eritrea - has displaced hundreds of thousands more. A spokesperson for the UN World Food Programme said that the organisation estimated that of the 500,000 Eritreans displaced by the war, two-thirds were in need of emergency aid. As many as 100,000 Eritreans have already fled across the border into neighbouring Sudan, and it is feared that the number will rise. Sudan is itself embroiled in a civil war and it is in no position to assist the recent influx of people from Eritrea. The Sudanese state of Kassala said recently that it had exhausted its stocks of food and medicine, and had launched an emergency appeal for international assistance.",

      "bodyText": "The son of Max Hastings, editor of London's Evening Standard, has died in China, it was announced yesterday. Charles Hastings, 27, died in Shanghai on Wednesday, a statement by Daily Mail and General Holdings Ltd said. He was believed to have been working as an English teacher after travelling in the country. Max Hastings was contacted by the Foreign Office on Wednesday night and flew out to Shanghai yesterday to get first hand details of his son's death. The Foreign Office said there were no suspicious circumstances, but the incidence of violence against foreigners is rising. Earlier this month, Shirine Harburn, a London backpacker, died after being stabbed 12 times on Paomao mountain in Sichuan, and a German executive and his family were murdered in their compound in Nanjing on April 2.",

      "trailText": "<p>When she blasted onto our screens as Anna in This Life, Scottish actress Daniela Nardini became an icon for a generation of women. But fame was never on her agenda, as she explains to  Maxton Walker</p>",
      "byline": "Maxton Walker",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Daniela Nardini is cripplingly shy. Famous for it. Which is no doubt why I'm standing here listening to her telling a bawdy story about an acquaintance who found some naughty pictures of her on the internet. This may sound like the perfect fantasy for some men. But I'm too shocked to listen properly to the tale, which involves her friend refusing to stump up the cash required to get the \"full monty\". </p> <p>Actually, this is very unfair. She is, for the most part of our meeting in the plush drawing room of a west London hotel near her home, the epitome of an immaculate hostess. She jumps up to shut the door when the wind blows it open, pours the tea, and even laughs politely at an unfunny anecdote about Tom Cruise. The shyness thing (totally untrue, you'll have gathered) arose from the first interviews she did to promote This Life. \"I did used to get panicky talking to journalists,\" she admits in a very soft version of that instantly recognisable voice. \"They got confused because I wasn't at all like Anna. So they said, 'she's shy'. And I think it's also part of the Scottish thing. I don't have that English public school confidence.\" </p> <p>It doesn't show. The only real trait that escapes from behind the effortlessly charming exterior - the sort you get from a good, austere Scottish upbringing - is the merest hint of world-weariness. Although this may only be that she's tiring of a steady stream of journalists asking the same banal questions (\"It seems to be Daniela Nardini week in Scotland. Every time my dad picks up a paper, I'm in it\"). </p> <p>She is obviously more used to the attention she receives these days, although she still remembers clearly the almost physical shock of instant fame that came with This Life. \"I was pestered a lot in bars. It was ridiculous. Like being in Take That.\" </p> <p>This was around the time, you may remember, when there were editorials in newspapers calling for senior BBC executives to be lynched after it transpired that the second series of This Life would be the last. The corporation was accused of dragging its heels until the actors moved on to other projects. But Nardini doesn't remember it that way: \"We'd done 22 episodes in five months,\" she says. \"We were like vegetables. And towards the end we all felt, well it's been great fun, these characters have been fantastic, but we have to move on.\" </p> <p>Since then, she's made shrewd use of the springboard that This Life gave her. Instead of going on to lend spurious credibility to the rash of clones which followed, like some of her ex-co-stars - she's chosen her projects more carefully. Most memorably, we've seen her as a 60s feminist in Fay Weldon's Big Women and a plainclothes policewoman with marriage problems in Undercover Heart. She is aware, though, that nothing has quite managed to dislodge Anna from producers' minds. \"I do seem to get offered the parts of professional women juggling career and emotions. Women are a strange combination of things, especially these days when there is so much pressure to be good at your work. And then when you hit your 30s, you have to think about things like: when will I have a family?\" </p> <p>It's odd, though, that she doesn't betray any obvious symptoms of the driven actor: no furious chain-smoking or fingernail-chewing.

      "bodyText": "Daniela Nardini is cripplingly shy. Famous for it. Which is no doubt why I'm standing here listening to her telling a bawdy story about an acquaintance who found some naughty pictures of her on the internet. This may sound like the perfect fantasy for some men. But I'm too shocked to listen properly to the tale, which involves her friend refusing to stump up the cash required to get the \"full monty\". Actually, this is very unfair. She is, for the most part of our meeting in the plush drawing room of a west London hotel near her home, the epitome of an immaculate hostess. She jumps up to shut the door when the wind blows it open, pours the tea, and even laughs politely at an unfunny anecdote about Tom Cruise. The shyness thing (totally untrue, you'll have gathered) arose from the first interviews she did to promote This Life. \"I did used to get panicky talking to journalists,\" she admits in a very soft version of that instantly recognisable voice. \"They got confused because I wasn't at all like Anna. So they said, 'she's shy'. And I think it's also part of the Scottish thing. I don't have that English public school confidence.\" It doesn't show. The only real trait that escapes from behind the effortlessly charming exterior - the sort you get from a good, austere Scottish upbringing - is the merest hint of world-weariness. Although this may only be that she's tiring of a steady stream of journalists asking the same banal questions (\"It seems to be Daniela Nardini week in Scotland. Every time my dad picks up a paper, I'm in it\"). She is obviously more used to the attention she receives these days, although she still remembers clearly the almost physical shock of instant fame that came with This Life. \"I was pestered a lot in bars. It was ridiculous. Like being in Take That.\" This was around the time, you may remember, when there were editorials in newspapers calling for senior BBC executives to be lynched after it transpired that the second series of This Life would be the last. The corporation was accused of dragging its heels until the actors moved on to other projects. But Nardini doesn't remember it that way: \"We'd done 22 episodes in five months,\" she says. \"We were like vegetables. And towards the end we all felt, well it's been great fun, these characters have been fantastic, but we have to move on.\" Since then, she's made shrewd use of the springboard that This Life gave her. Instead of going on to lend spurious credibility to the rash of clones which followed, like some of her ex-co-stars - she's chosen her projects more carefully. Most memorably, we've seen her as a 60s feminist in Fay Weldon's Big Women and a plainclothes policewoman with marriage problems in Undercover Heart. She is aware, though, that nothing has quite managed to dislodge Anna from producers' minds. \"I do seem to get offered the parts of professional women juggling career and emotions. Women are a strange combination of things, especially these days when there is so much pressure to be good at your work. And then when you hit your 30s, you have to think about things like: when will I have a family?\" It's odd, though, that she doesn't betray any obvious symptoms of the driven actor: no furious chain-smoking or fingernail-chewing. Nor are there any hints that she might be a pathological attention-seeker. Isn't she a bit too well balanced to be an actor? \"I don't think,\" she admits, \"that I ever wanted to be famous. The fact is, the more famous you are, the more interesting jobs you get offered.\" And there are days, she says, when it seems like hard work. \"Sometimes I get quite tired of acting. I think how nice it must be to have a proper career and to know what's going to happen next.\" What's happening now is Rough Treatment, a two-part ITV drama, starting this weekend.

But this is not strictly in the US constitution.\"</p> <p>Mr Prodi's most provocative remarks came when he voiced fears that Mr Blair was taking a low profile on the euro. Asked whether he was surprised that Mr Blair was not doing more to move Britain towards membership of the euro, Mr Prodi said: \"No I'm not surprised. The public is too biased now. A politician must be aware of public opinion. Of course a leader cannot only follow, but this does not mean that he must make a mission impossible.\"</p> <p>His remarks echo the private thoughts of cabinet ministers such as Mr Cook who believes that Downing Street is in danger of throwing away Britain's chances of joining the euro after the next election. The prime minister says he is in favour in principle of joining a successful euro, but he will only call a referendum if Britain meets a series of economic tests.</p> <p>The foreign secretary, who is supported in cabinet by the pro-Europeans Peter Mandelson and Stephen Byers, agrees with the prime minister's position. But Mr Cook believes that Downing Street should do more to spell out the potential benefits of joining the euro.</p> <p>The prime minister will take some comfort from Mr Prodi's interview because he admits that it is not all down to the British government to spell out the case for the euro. \"You will be convinced only by the good behaviour of the euro,\" Mr Prodi said. \"And of course, by the good behaviour of the Europeans.\"</p> <p>Mr Prodi voiced the hope that Britain would quickly change its mind over the euro, in the way that voters decided to endorse British membership of the EEC in 1975 after opinion polls had shown overwhelming opposition.</p> <p>\"It will be like the common market\" he said. \"You were against it for a long time. Then, in one weekend, you decided: 'These terrible continentals are boring, but they buy and sell a lot'.\"</p> <p>Opponents of the euro seized on Mr Prodi's interview as a sign of the crisis over the currency. Andrew Halbendy, from the Business for Sterling campaign, said: \"The political leaders of the euro-zone have no idea how to build confidence in the single currency and Prodi's comments today are extremely unhelpful.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Romano Prodi, the president of the European Commission, yesterday stepped into the cabinet row over the European single currency when he chided Tony Blair for failing to take a lead on the euro. In a rare rebuke to a European leader, Mr Prodi accused the prime minister of setting himself a \"mission impossible\" by failing to confront British eurosceptics opposed to the currency. His intervention is likely to be welcomed in private by pro-European cabinet ministers, such as the foreign secretary Robin Cook, who are urging the prime minister to speak out about the potential benefits if Britain joined the euro. Mr Prodi tried yesterday to reach out to opponents of the euro by saying that Britain could abandon the single currency after joining. In an interview with the eurosceptic Spectator, Mr Prodi said that it would be possible for Britain to leave the euro and retain its membership of the European Union in \"exceptional circumstances provided it was not done in a way which was hostile to the EU\". The commission president added: \"In an extreme case, one could always foresee, for example, that Texas might leave the dollar. But this is not strictly in the US constitution.\" Mr Prodi's most provocative remarks came when he voiced fears that Mr Blair was taking a low profile on the euro. Asked whether he was surprised that Mr Blair was not doing more to move Britain towards membership of the euro, Mr Prodi said: \"No I'm not surprised. The public is too biased now. A politician must be aware of public opinion. Of course a leader cannot only follow, but this does not mean that he must make a mission impossible.\" His remarks echo the private thoughts of cabinet ministers such as Mr Cook who believes that Downing Street is in danger of throwing away Britain's chances of joining the euro after the next election. The prime minister says he is in favour in principle of joining a successful euro, but he will only call a referendum if Britain meets a series of economic tests. The foreign secretary, who is supported in cabinet by the pro-Europeans Peter Mandelson and Stephen Byers, agrees with the prime minister's position. But Mr Cook believes that Downing Street should do more to spell out the potential benefits of joining the euro. The prime minister will take some comfort from Mr Prodi's interview because he admits that it is not all down to the British government to spell out the case for the euro. \"You will be convinced only by the good behaviour of the euro,\" Mr Prodi said. \"And of course, by the good behaviour of the Europeans.\" Mr Prodi voiced the hope that Britain would quickly change its mind over the euro, in the way that voters decided to endorse British membership of the EEC in 1975 after opinion polls had shown overwhelming opposition. \"It will be like the common market\" he said. \"You were against it for a long time. Then, in one weekend, you decided: 'These terrible continentals are boring, but they buy and sell a lot'.\" Opponents of the euro seized on Mr Prodi's interview as a sign of the crisis over the currency. Andrew Halbendy, from the Business for Sterling campaign, said: \"The political leaders of the euro-zone have no idea how to build confidence in the single currency and Prodi's comments today are extremely unhelpful.\"",

      "bodyText": "Thousands of Chinese students yesterday mourned the death of a fellow student after two days of protest which have alarmed government officials in Beijing. The students at Beijing University complained about lax policing and demanded the resignation of senior staff after 19-year-old Qiu Qingfeng was raped and murdered near a university annexe. Ms Qiu's body was discovered on Saturday in an orchard where she had been waylaid after missing her bus. After taking another bus part of the way, she faced a 40- minute walk through unlit countryside to her dormitory. Beijing officials are acutely sensitive to unrest at the university which is a traditional centre of student protest since the early years of Chinese nationalism. The 11th anniversary of the June 3 1989 Beijing massacre is only a few days away. Officials have promised to meet student leaders to respond to demands for better safety and improvements in university administration. Earlier this week Communist party officials were said to have ordered a news blackout on the tragedy but this was ignored by contributors to internet bulletin boards. The university vice-president, Lin Junjing was shouted down by students at a meeting on Wednesday after cries of: \"Do you have any conscience?\" Mourning messages hung on noticeboards around the campus, and a makeshift shrine to Ms Qiu was set up. An online site in Ms Qiu's memory registered more than 12,700 hits expressing sorrow and anger. Students said yesterday that internet bulletin boards had been closed down at Beijing University and at neighbouring Qinghua University. Most Chinese students today say they have no desire to confront the authorities over political questions in the way that ended so disastrously in June 1989. But the government knows that student protests on non-political issues have in the past escalated into more serious challenges to its authority.",

      "body": "<p>In 1900, one out of every 472 inhabitants of Jackson County, Wisconsin was certified insane. In the last decade of the 19th century, everyday life in and around Black River Falls, a small Jackson County town, was a litany of madness, suicide, murder, disease and child mortality. And yet a local newspaperman was able to comment, \"Nowhere in this great continent of ours can be found a more desirable residence than Black River Falls.\" </p> <p>In 1973, American historian Michael Lesy published his book Wisconsin Death Trip - part photo album, part scrapbook, part impressionistic speculation on the late 19th-century American rural psyche. The book comprised a selection of photographs taken between 1890 and 1910 by a Black River Falls photographer, Charles Van Schaick, together with extracts from the local newspaper, the Badger State Banner, and from the records of the Mendota state asylum, a thriving institution at the time. </p> <p>The photographs - from a collection of 30,000 glass plate negatives - tell one set of stories, preserving for posterity local worthies, bucolic rituals and floral tributes to the dead of all ages. The writing, largely by the Banner's English-born editor Frank Cooper and his son George, tells a different story, one that sometimes defies belief. Itinerants slash three cows' throats in a revenge killing. A widow is convinced that witches are persecuting her. A boy is unable to speak above a whisper for 16 months, following a visit to a hypnotist. An alleged wife-murderer devours the springs of his prison bed. Countless children die. Countless men and women go mad, kill themselves, kill each other. </p> <p>Many of these anecdotes, and others equally uncanny, feature in a new film inspired by Lesy's book, also called Wisconsin Death Trip. While the book offers various social, historical and ideological readings of the time and place, the film's director, James Marsh, is less concerned to pursue Lesy's analysis than to bring to life the world of 1890s Black River Falls. His film is neither fiction, nor recognisable docu-drama, nor reconstructed history. It is more a dreamlike succession of vignettes, evoked as if in a seance or lantern show. \"I tried to make the dramatic scenes like animated photographs,\" Marsh says. </p> <p>Shot by Eigil Bryld in stark, crisp black and white to emulate the original photographs, Wisconsin Death Trip echoes the rural visions of American film-makers from John Ford to Terrence Malick, as well as the literary gothic of Poe, Faulkner and Cormac McCarthy. But this chilly exhibit of antique Americana comes from an unlikely source - British director Marsh made it for the BBC's Arena strand. </p> <p>Marsh discovered Lesy's book in a New York bookshop nine years ago, and was struck by the faces in Van Schaick's photos: \"Those long exposures create a rather haunted look in people's eyes.\" He originally planned to make a more conventional documentary, then opted to create a \"self-contained world\" - \"It seemed right to do something much purer, without giving too much information, or trying to give reasons why these stories happened. You can allow an incremental sense of life at that time to unfold, by choosing these extreme examples of people's lives going wrong.\" </p> <p>Hence these accumulated anecdotes, roughly arranged into four seasons and overall forming a quasi-musical pattern of parallels and repetitions. Charismatic figures emerge to grab their own headline space: Mary Sweeney, the Wisconsin Window Smasher, and opera singer Pauline L'Allemand, once the lead in Delibes' opera Lakm\u00e9, now reduced to eating cattlefeed. </p> <p>Wisconsin Death Trip is always lyrical, sometimes blackly farcical, and sometimes terrifying, as it reveals the romanticised American frontier's true desperation. \"The more stories you have of lovelorn suicides or madness,\" says Marsh, \"the more you see what that time was really scared of. Today we don't report suicides or outbreaks of madness in the way they did - these are really the primal anxieties of that community and that time. They are parading what they are most scared of.\" </p> <p>Both the book and the film convey a sense of how madness was understood in America at the time. Lesy refers to contemporary theories of \"degeneracy\" and \"American nervousness\", while his bibliography includes Foucault and Laing; he's interested in madness as social product and social discourse. He concludes that in 1890s rural America, there was little choice but to be either obsessive-compulsive or paranoid: in other words, an upstanding thrifty citizen or a barking backwoods crazy. But Lesy also outlines the concrete reasons why Wisconsin's supposedly Edenic terrain became hell for so many: disease, brutal winters and the overall economic depression of America in the 1890s. </p> <p>Another aspect of the community's history features in the film, if only fleetingly. Early on, we see contemporary photos of Winnebago Indians: we hear how they obligingly allowed themselves to be displaced from their lands. There's only this brief mention, but the Winnebagos' absence represents an unspoken Repressed: the film is haunted by a key myth of American horror cinema (most spectacularly represented in Poltergeist and The Shining), namely the idea that Wasp prosperity was built on Native American burial grounds. </p> <p>\"The Winnebagos,\" Marsh explains, \"were shipped out wholesale to Nebraska and kept walking back, to occupy marginal land outside communities like Black River Falls. In the film, that's nailed in three photos - you can draw your own conclusions.\" A punchline, however, comes in the film's closing sequence, with its present-day shots of a Native American-owned casino. \"That suggests they've never been away, and that they've got our number. In the last 10 years, a lot of tribes have got very rich on servicing the gambling and greedy needs of the white population.\" </p> <p>The film is a love letter to photographic history. Both Van Schaick's originals and Marsh's reconstructions closely parallel the likes of August Sander and Diane Arbus, although Marsh's unlikely cinematic model was Chris Marker's 1962 short, La Jet\u00e9e, an object lesson in telling a story through stills. Many of Van Schaick's pictures were specially staged photo-cenotaphs: looking at his dead babies and (just about living) desiccated greybeards and matrons, it's hard not to think of his work as a kind of mummification.</p> <p>\"Memorial photography was the biggest genre of photography in the 1890s,\" Marsh says. \"There's a certain act of magic that takes place for the subjects, and that's a conceptual notion that we tried to build into the film. We might find those images hard to look at, but they have a very honest and tender motivation - to remember a lost life by.\" </p> <p>The film's oddly haunted feel - as though the actors are possessed by the ancestors they play - derives from the fact that its entire cast is from Wisconsin. Marsh arranged open casting calls in Madison and Milwaukee, specifically for people of Scandinavian or German origins. Two-thirds of them had never acted before, and in fact the film calls for them simply to be there, part of the tableaux. \"Most of these people were like open canvases - I wanted them not to act but to be very blank and let the viewer bring the emotions to those faces.\" </p> <p>A further ring of authenticity comes from the locations, all historical sites in Wisconsin. The film was made during four separate trips, over 16 months, but Marsh spent a year overall in Wisconsin, including time for research, returning to Lesy's original sources. </p> <p>Ostensibly a television film, Wisconsin Death Trip really comes into its own on the big screen; it has already done the rounds of American and European festivals, where it has been widely acclaimed as one of the outstanding recent British films. Shot on a standard documentary budget, with input from American company Cinemax, it is one of several films made for Arena that have had a cinema life - others are Stonewall, Paris is Burning and I Shot Andy Warhol.</p> <p>Marsh himself has made other contributions to Arena's distinctive line in genre-bending documentaries: among them, The Burger and the King (on Elvis Presley's regal diet), Trouble Man (on the death of Marvin Gaye) and assorted \"biographies\" of pop songs. But only a couple of years after embarking on Wisconsin Death Trip, he is doubtful whether such a film could still be made in Britain. \"Arena is one of the last bastions of British TV where you can take an idea that seems so formless and experimental and hybrid and get a hearing. But it's increasingly hard to make those one-off maverick ideas.\" Now based in New York, Marsh is about to embark on his first fiction feature: murder figures prominently, and no doubt the tormented souls of Black River Falls will smile on his efforts.</p> <p>\u0095 Wisconsin Death Trip screens at London's National Film Theatre from next Friday, and is shown on BBC2 on July 2. Michael Lesy's book, Wisconsin Death Trip, is published by University of New Mexico Press.</p>",

There's only this brief mention, but the Winnebagos' absence represents an unspoken Repressed: the film is haunted by a key myth of American horror cinema (most spectacularly represented in Poltergeist and The Shining), namely the idea that Wasp prosperity was built on Native American burial grounds. \"The Winnebagos,\" Marsh explains, \"were shipped out wholesale to Nebraska and kept walking back, to occupy marginal land outside communities like Black River Falls. In the film, that's nailed in three photos - you can draw your own conclusions.\" A punchline, however, comes in the film's closing sequence, with its present-day shots of a Native American-owned casino. \"That suggests they've never been away, and that they've got our number. In the last 10 years, a lot of tribes have got very rich on servicing the gambling and greedy needs of the white population.\" The film is a love letter to photographic history. Both Van Schaick's originals and Marsh's reconstructions closely parallel the likes of August Sander and Diane Arbus, although Marsh's unlikely cinematic model was Chris Marker's 1962 short, La Jet\u00e9e, an object lesson in telling a story through stills. Many of Van Schaick's pictures were specially staged photo-cenotaphs: looking at his dead babies and (just about living) desiccated greybeards and matrons, it's hard not to think of his work as a kind of mummification. \"Memorial photography was the biggest genre of photography in the 1890s,\" Marsh says. \"There's a certain act of magic that takes place for the subjects, and that's a conceptual notion that we tried to build into the film. We might find those images hard to look at, but they have a very honest and tender motivation - to remember a lost life by.\" The film's oddly haunted feel - as though the actors are possessed by the ancestors they play - derives from the fact that its entire cast is from Wisconsin. Marsh arranged open casting calls in Madison and Milwaukee, specifically for people of Scandinavian or German origins. Two-thirds of them had never acted before, and in fact the film calls for them simply to be there, part of the tableaux. \"Most of these people were like open canvases - I wanted them not to act but to be very blank and let the viewer bring the emotions to those faces.\" A further ring of authenticity comes from the locations, all historical sites in Wisconsin. The film was made during four separate trips, over 16 months, but Marsh spent a year overall in Wisconsin, including time for research, returning to Lesy's original sources. Ostensibly a television film, Wisconsin Death Trip really comes into its own on the big screen; it has already done the rounds of American and European festivals, where it has been widely acclaimed as one of the outstanding recent British films. Shot on a standard documentary budget, with input from American company Cinemax, it is one of several films made for Arena that have had a cinema life - others are Stonewall, Paris is Burning and I Shot Andy Warhol. Marsh himself has made other contributions to Arena's distinctive line in genre-bending documentaries: among them, The Burger and the King (on Elvis Presley's regal diet), Trouble Man (on the death of Marvin Gaye) and assorted \"biographies\" of pop songs. But only a couple of years after embarking on Wisconsin Death Trip, he is doubtful whether such a film could still be made in Britain. \"Arena is one of the last bastions of British TV where you can take an idea that seems so formless and experimental and hybrid and get a hearing. But it's increasingly hard to make those one-off maverick ideas.\" Now based in New York, Marsh is about to embark on his first fiction feature: murder figures prominently, and no doubt the tormented souls of Black River Falls will smile on his efforts. \u0095 Wisconsin Death Trip screens at London's National Film Theatre from next Friday, and is shown on BBC2 on July 2. Michael Lesy's book, Wisconsin Death Trip, is published by University of New Mexico Press.",

      "body": "<p>In his latest film, The King of Paris, by first-time director Dominique Maillet, Philippe Noiret plays an egotistical stage celebrity of the 30s whose befriending of a calculating waif (Veronika Varga) with theatrical ambitions leads to family tragedy. It is a role his theatrical hero, Jules Berry would have relished: solid fare in the style of 40s Hollywood given resonance, as has so often been the case, by Noiret's performance. </p> <p>\"He had that dimension of folly,\" Noiret says, \"which - alas! - no longer exists in our profession.\" Reclining at elegant ease in the French ambassador's residence in London, cravat impeccable, trousers pressed to a scimitar's sharpness, shoecaps reflecting the Bourbon trinkets on the marble mantlepiece, Noiret, now 69, gave a profound sigh for times past, the rich baritone-to-bass voice as polished an appendage as anything he wore. </p> <p>Berry was, in real life and often in his roles, a glorious rogue. He played the fake cur\u00e9 of Renoir's Le Crime de Monsieur Lange and the saturnine seducer of Carn\u00e9's Le Jour se L\u00e8ve. \"He was a vagabond,\" Noiret says with approval. \"He was a terrible gambler and the bailiffs seized his furniture so often, he had to live permanently in a hotel. He stayed at the Lutetia at S\u00e8vres Babylone. I went to school at the Institut Catholique round the corner and would often see him standing outside the hotel while the porter hailed a taxi for him to go to Longchamps.\" </p> <p>Although he made his debut in Agn\u00e8s Varda's fledgling 1955 work, La Pointe Courte, it was not until 1960 that Noiret, then a renowned stage actor, made his mark on French cinema. In Louis Malle's 1960 classic Zazie dans le M\u00e9tro, he was the exasperated uncle put in charge of a foul-mouthed 11-year-old, who goes romping through Paris during a M\u00e9tro strike.</p> <p>Raymond Queneau's surrealist story gave Noiret the opportunity to put on display a number of his trademark characteristics: the world-weary insouciance (although he was only 30), the air of dreamy disconnection, the bloodhound lugubriousness and the sudden eruptions of robust anger. Above all, it introduced filmgoers to one of the great voices of French cinema, a deep cello sound which somehow escapes fruitiness or affectation. </p> <p>For the moment he was more concerned with defending comedy, a genre which he believes does not get its due from French critics. He is soon to make a film with Philippe de Broca and applauds de Broca's recent remark: \"I demand the right to frivolity.\"</p> <p>\"We are at an epoch,\" Noiret says, \"when right-thinking people do not approve of making comedy films. It is true that we get less attention from the media when we do a comedy than when we do something serious. We live in a time when the intellectual power of the press has a tendency to be too serious. Above all in France - perhaps in England it is too much on the other side. The equilibrium is difficult to find between a dictatorship of the intellectuals or a dictatorship of entertainment pure and simple.\" </p> <p>But Noiret is that kind of well-rounded personality who is as convincing in his defence of high seriousness as he is of its opposite. His international reputation is too often linked to sentimental works such as Il Postino, for which he won a Bafta, and Cinema Paradiso (the film made in 1988 and voted the Guardian readers' favourite film of the last 20 years a few years ago, in which that great voice was lost in the Italian dubbing) but he was also the leader of a bunch of suicidal gluttons in the truly bilious comedy, La Grande Bouffe. What was not evident when he made Zazie was a capacity for sustaining great dramatic roles as a trawl of his 134 films will confirm. It was Bertrand Tavernier who first effectively brought out that capacity in The Watchmaker of St Paul in 1974. </p> <p>He has often collaborated with Tavernier since and in this professional relationship which has spanned more than 20 years there is a link to an earlier figure crucial to Noiret's development - Jean Vilar, director of the hugely successful Th\u00e9tre National Populaire. Noiret began his career aged 23 with Vilar's theatre and stayed there for seven years. \"I did a bit of everything in the repertoire,\" he says. \"Moli\u00e8re, Mother Courage, Richard III, Murder in the Cathedral - I was one of the knights and also one of the assassins.\" </p> <p>Was there a connection in his mind between these two personalities? \"It is not by chance I have done so many films with Tavernier,\" he says. \"I re-found Vilar's preoccupations in Tavernier. Tavernier makes films which are popular cinema in the best sense of the word, cinema which is accessible to everyone. But at the same time, they are carriers of certain values, certain commentary on our world. They both have a great sense of justice. They are people who have the courage to effectively participate in the social and political life of an epoch, people who reject this detachment of the artist who lives in his own world protected by his aesthetic preoccupations.\" </p> <p>\"But they are very different personalities,\" Noiret says. \"One [Vilar] was after all a Protestant, even though he was a Protestant of the Midi, a person very severe of aspect but very kind. While Bertrand is a tempest, a gourmand, an ogre for life and information who does not limit himself in his appetites for culture of all kinds, cinema, Chinese, poetry, astronomy, everything. He wrote a book on Michael Powell - two volumes, not just the usual anecdotal stuff. They are two real books,\" he says with wonder. </p> <p>\"Tavernier is perhaps the most cultivated man I know. A spirit fabricated from material different from others. At least from mine.\" He assumes an air of lugubrious modesty. </p> <p>But he cheers up quickly. We now get on to another monster of the cinema: Hitchcock. In 1969 Hitchcock, needing French actors for Topaz, asked a contact in Paris to put together a reel illustrating the talent and personality of various French actors. Noiret was among those chosen for this particularly sluggish CIA thriller. </p> <p>\"Because it was French critics who elevated Hitchcock to the top rank when his work was regarded as nothing more than good entertainment by the American press,\" Noiret says, \"Hitchcock had a certain tenderness for France. </p> <p>\"We had a very friendly and agreeable relationship. We dined at his hotel, the Plaza Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e. He liked it very much. He said I know the chef, the cuisine is good, so why go out when I have everything I want here? He did not want to go and have adventures with other restaurants.\" </p> <p>Hitchcock was notorious for having worked out every shot and camera angle before shooting a foot of film, leaving little leeway in movement or interpretation for the actor. So how did Noiret feel about submitting to chalk marks? He laughs. \"There were no chalk marks. He gave no directions at all,\" Noiret says. \"He gave no hint as to interpretation. The positioning was so precise we did not have any need of guidance as to interpretation. One had a sensation of being, how will I put it...\" </p> <p>Cornered? </p> <p>\"Yes, cornered, but in the best sense. It is true that every movement had its proper space in the frame. One felt that each movement asked for had its raison d'\u00eatre and this helped indicate your character.\" </p> <p>And, after all that, it wasn't his best film? </p> <p>Noiret laughs. \"Far from it.\" </p> <p>And what was it like doing Zazie? No chalk marks there? </p> <p>Noiret reveals a secret of Zazie's curious narrative pace, eccentric even by nouvelle vague standards. This was not achieved by simple mechanical means such as slow and quick motion. \"There were certain sequences,\" Noiret says, \"where we were filmed speeded up. But in others Malle said: 'Slow down your movements and I will shoot at normal speed. But since you couldn't move with a truly accurate rhythm it will give something strange to your movements.' \" </p> <p>What became of the little girl, Catherine Demongeot? \"She abandoned the cinema. She became a professor of French. She was very charming and had a talent for irony which is rare in a child. But she never made another film.\" </p> <p>After moving to the commercial theatre, where he played in the first production of Fran\u00e7oise Sagan's Un Ch\u00e2teau en Su\u00e8de, Noiret abandoned the theatre in favour of cinema. \"I did both at the same time and found it was very disagreeable trying to fit it in,\" he says. \"I lost the pleasure of working in the theatre and since the cinema was something new, I developed a taste for it. They also offered interesting roles. </p> <p>\"I remained 30 years without doing theatre and I regret it,\" he says. \"But two years ago, I returned to the theatre just by chance. The film director, Bertrand Blier, wrote his first play for two actors, one part was written for G\u00e9rard Depardieu, who said yes and then no. We have the same agent and he suggested me and I did it.\" </p> <p>In his next stage performance, he will take the Gambon part in The Unexpected Man, Yasmina Reza's double interior monologue of a novelist and a woman in a train compartment. </p> <p>Noiret is married to the actress Monique Chaumette. They have a daughter. \"We have been married 40 years,\" Noiret says. \"I think they may be erecting a statue to us representing conjugal love.\"</p> <p>\u0095 The King of Paris opens next Friday.</p>",

      "body": "<p>They'd never done it before. But, with a screening of some rough footage, and, no doubt, a big white grin, Tom Cruise managed to persuade US rock giants Metallica - for the first time in their two-decade career - to lend new material to a film. Their song I Disappear is the lead-off cut from the soundtrack to the Cruise-starring Mission: Impossible 2, which two weeks ago entered the US album chart at No 2, though the film has yet to appear. \"If you are going to associate yourself with a movie, this is the perfect one,\" enthused the band's Lars Ulrich. \"Everything about it is big. We love it.\" </p> <p>Well, everybody else is doing it - why shouldn't they? This year alone, U2 have knocked out new tunes for Wim Wenders' The Million Dollar Hotel, while Madonna has warmed over Don McLean's American Pie for her latest vehicle, The Next Best Thing. And, as yet more pop stars attempt to launch movie careers, we find three-quarters of All Saints warbling Motown classics on the soundtrack to Honest (their debut acting gig), and the unstoppable Geri Halliwell announcing she will both star in and provide much of the music for a new British film, Therapy. </p> <p>It's little wonder artists are so keen to get themselves on to these discs: a hit movie theme can be just what a big act needs to keep things ticking over between tours and studio albums. What's more, soundtracks have been the sleeper album chart success story of the last decade. In 1996 an America industry survey found that US music buyers were snapping up four times as many soundtrack albums as they had been 10 years before.</p> <p>Over there, 15 soundtracks (unlike in the UK, they are included in the main album chart) accounted for 73 weeks at No 1 between the start of 1990 and the close of 1999, 20 of those weeks being registered by the album for The Bodyguard - the catalyst perhaps for the massive interest being witnessed now. Over here, two film themes - Bryan Adams's Everything I Do (I Do It for You) from Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, and Wet Wet Wet's Love Is All Around (Four Weddings and a Funeral) - became the longest-running singles chart number ones ever. </p> <p>Evidently, movie music in recent times has moved a lot of people, if only in the direction of the nearest HMV. Big theme songs, invariably belted out by big names, have increasingly been issued to radio before anybody has even seen the films from which they are taken - purpose-built to dominate the airwaves in the weeks before to the film's release and play their part in creating a \"buzz\". Put simply, soundtracks have shifted from being a mere film tie-in to a powerful, up-front marketing tool.</p> <p>When distributor Miramax decided in 1994 to spend \u00a31m giving a hip soundtrack to Kevin Smith's debut Clerks - a film which cost $27,000 to make - it seemed to be trying to launch a film off the back of a record than vice versa. Put big stars in your movie, put big stars on your soundtrack, the credo now seems to be, and sit back as hopefully one helps sell the other. </p> <p>It goes without saying that Hollywood and the music business have always been good pals: Bond movies, for instance, have long relied on a brassy theme song by a top-drawer artist, and producer Robert Stigwood commissioned songs for Saturday Night Fever before the script and director were in place. But in recent years this friendship has become even closer - a development easily explained by the fact that Hollywood and the music business are now pretty much one and the same entity. Warners, DreamWorks and Sony/Columbia all produce records with one arm and films with another; in fact, of the major studios, only Fox and Paramount do not have an affiliated record label. </p> <p>So when, say, a film is deemed to need a pop-oriented rather than score soundtrack (some have both), one of three things tends to happen. If the studio's associated record label is prepared to shell out serious cash, it gets its top artists to record new songs, producing a compilation which puts forward its biggest and best. Last summer's Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, as a New Line Cinema release (a Warner subsidiary), got a soundtrack featuring Warner big guns such as Madonna, Lenny Kravitz, Green Day and REM. </p> <p>Madonna's specially written track Beautiful Stranger was chosen to launch the album (released on Maverick, Madonna's own label and a Warner imprint), and its heavy airplay no doubt played a key part in creating advance awareness of the film. But the really clever move on the part of the record company was that, while Beautiful Stranger reached No 2 in the UK chart, it was not issued as a single in America - increasingly common practice in an effort to shift more albums (which make big profits) rather than singles (which don't). This meant that anyone wanting to own the track would have to buy the entire album, and 1.3m did. </p> <p>Alternatively, a record company can take a song from a recent or upcoming release, perhaps by a nascent or struggling act who would benefit from the exposure afforded by a film. When a Columbia rep caught the live act of Nashville quintet Sixpence None The Richer, he hawked their ballad Kiss Me around various film producers until meeting with interest from the makers of 1999 teen sleeper She's All That. </p> <p>An official soundtrack was never released, but ads for the movie used the cut, and the video featured leads Freddie Prinze Jr and Rachael Leigh Cooke, consolidating the film-music crossover. The result? Eight years after their formation, the band's 1997 album vaulted up the US chart. Naturally, though, the most cost-effective soundtrack albums are for those movies which don't require new recordings. Nostalgia-fests such as New Line's 1985-set The Wedding Singer gave Warner the opportunity to repackage various New Romantic hits from its archive and sell them again to a generation who'd never heard of Dead or Alive or Culture Club. Also riding the retro wave, the recent rash of 70s-set films (Boogie Nights, 54, Summer Of Sam) has caused the market to be flooded with uninspired disco compilations. </p> <p>But at least the songs featured on such soundtracks might be said to have successfully evoked an era. Albums such as those for Mission: Impossible 2 and last year's The Matrix have predictably traded on the films' young male appeal to showcase hard rock or rap acts (Marilyn Manson, Limp Bizkit, Rage Against The Machine) but have only the most tenuous of links to the plot. Some records are even billed as \"songs inspired by the motion picture\", which generally seems to herald a collection of tunes whose inclusion is not only hard to justify artistically, but of which many are not even heard in the film. </p> <p>Soundtrack albums are now less about complementing a director's vision than about overall brand strengthening, and, ultimately, seeking to be hit records in their own right.

It's certainly not very often the director.

John Cusack had a hand in compiling the soundtrack to his new film, High Fidelity.

      "bodyText": "They'd never done it before. But, with a screening of some rough footage, and, no doubt, a big white grin, Tom Cruise managed to persuade US rock giants Metallica - for the first time in their two-decade career - to lend new material to a film. Their song I Disappear is the lead-off cut from the soundtrack to the Cruise-starring Mission: Impossible 2, which two weeks ago entered the US album chart at No 2, though the film has yet to appear. \"If you are going to associate yourself with a movie, this is the perfect one,\" enthused the band's Lars Ulrich. \"Everything about it is big. We love it.\" Well, everybody else is doing it - why shouldn't they? This year alone, U2 have knocked out new tunes for Wim Wenders' The Million Dollar Hotel, while Madonna has warmed over Don McLean's American Pie for her latest vehicle, The Next Best Thing. And, as yet more pop stars attempt to launch movie careers, we find three-quarters of All Saints warbling Motown classics on the soundtrack to Honest (their debut acting gig), and the unstoppable Geri Halliwell announcing she will both star in and provide much of the music for a new British film, Therapy. It's little wonder artists are so keen to get themselves on to these discs: a hit movie theme can be just what a big act needs to keep things ticking over between tours and studio albums. What's more, soundtracks have been the sleeper album chart success story of the last decade. In 1996 an America industry survey found that US music buyers were snapping up four times as many soundtrack albums as they had been 10 years before. Over there, 15 soundtracks (unlike in the UK, they are included in the main album chart) accounted for 73 weeks at No 1 between the start of 1990 and the close of 1999, 20 of those weeks being registered by the album for The Bodyguard - the catalyst perhaps for the massive interest being witnessed now. Over here, two film themes - Bryan Adams's Everything I Do (I Do It for You) from Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, and Wet Wet Wet's Love Is All Around (Four Weddings and a Funeral) - became the longest-running singles chart number ones ever. Evidently, movie music in recent times has moved a lot of people, if only in the direction of the nearest HMV. Big theme songs, invariably belted out by big names, have increasingly been issued to radio before anybody has even seen the films from which they are taken - purpose-built to dominate the airwaves in the weeks before to the film's release and play their part in creating a \"buzz\". Put simply, soundtracks have shifted from being a mere film tie-in to a powerful, up-front marketing tool. When distributor Miramax decided in 1994 to spend \u00a31m giving a hip soundtrack to Kevin Smith's debut Clerks - a film which cost $27,000 to make - it seemed to be trying to launch a film off the back of a record than vice versa. Put big stars in your movie, put big stars on your soundtrack, the credo now seems to be, and sit back as hopefully one helps sell the other. It goes without saying that Hollywood and the music business have always been good pals: Bond movies, for instance, have long relied on a brassy theme song by a top-drawer artist, and producer Robert Stigwood commissioned songs for Saturday Night Fever before the script and director were in place. But in recent years this friendship has become even closer - a development easily explained by the fact that Hollywood and the music business are now pretty much one and the same entity. Warners, DreamWorks and Sony/Columbia all produce records with one arm and films with another; in fact, of the major studios, only Fox and Paramount do not have an affiliated record label. So when, say, a film is deemed to need a pop-oriented rather than score soundtrack (some have both), one of three things tends to happen. If the studio's associated record label is prepared to shell out serious cash, it gets its top artists to record new songs, producing a compilation which puts forward its biggest and best. Last summer's Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, as a New Line Cinema release (a Warner subsidiary), got a soundtrack featuring Warner big guns such as Madonna, Lenny Kravitz, Green Day and REM. Madonna's specially written track Beautiful Stranger was chosen to launch the album (released on Maverick, Madonna's own label and a Warner imprint), and its heavy airplay no doubt played a key part in creating advance awareness of the film. But the really clever move on the part of the record company was that, while Beautiful Stranger reached No 2 in the UK chart, it was not issued as a single in America - increasingly common practice in an effort to shift more albums (which make big profits) rather than singles (which don't). This meant that anyone wanting to own the track would have to buy the entire album, and 1.3m did. Alternatively, a record company can take a song from a recent or upcoming release, perhaps by a nascent or struggling act who would benefit from the exposure afforded by a film. When a Columbia rep caught the live act of Nashville quintet Sixpence None The Richer, he hawked their ballad Kiss Me around various film producers until meeting with interest from the makers of 1999 teen sleeper She's All That. An official soundtrack was never released, but ads for the movie used the cut, and the video featured leads Freddie Prinze Jr and Rachael Leigh Cooke, consolidating the film-music crossover. The result? Eight years after their formation, the band's 1997 album vaulted up the US chart. Naturally, though, the most cost-effective soundtrack albums are for those movies which don't require new recordings. Nostalgia-fests such as New Line's 1985-set The Wedding Singer gave Warner the opportunity to repackage various New Romantic hits from its archive and sell them again to a generation who'd never heard of Dead or Alive or Culture Club. Also riding the retro wave, the recent rash of 70s-set films (Boogie Nights, 54, Summer Of Sam) has caused the market to be flooded with uninspired disco compilations. But at least the songs featured on such soundtracks might be said to have successfully evoked an era. Albums such as those for Mission: Impossible 2 and last year's The Matrix have predictably traded on the films' young male appeal to showcase hard rock or rap acts (Marilyn Manson, Limp Bizkit, Rage Against The Machine) but have only the most tenuous of links to the plot. Some records are even billed as \"songs inspired by the motion picture\", which generally seems to herald a collection of tunes whose inclusion is not only hard to justify artistically, but of which many are not even heard in the film. Soundtrack albums are now less about complementing a director's vision than about overall brand strengthening, and, ultimately, seeking to be hit records in their own right. The very shape of a film is increasingly being dictated by the records a film producer or music supervisor has at his disposal. When they secured use of Britney Spears' hit (You Drive Me) Crazy, the makers of Close To You (a forthcoming Fox teen flick starring Melissa Joan Hart of Sabrina The Teenage Witch fame) promptly changed the movie's title to Drive Me Crazy. It's enough to make one wonder just who is getting to choose what we hear in films. It's certainly not very often the director. Tom Cruise's involvement in the Mission: Impossible 2 soundtrack would just seem to signal yet another aspect of film production falling under the control of an A-list star.

      "body": "<p>Stillness is not his style. Crammed into an armchair in an austere London hotel room, Matthew McConaughey's lengthy legs are experiencing a parallel jive-related existence underneath the coffee table. \"Anywhere, anytime is a good time to dance,\" he opines. \"It's the second form, after making love, of exercise. It's the original form of celebration. And everyone can do their own dance. You can tap yourself on the head for five straight minutes and that's your dance if that's what you hear.\" It's a rare moment of enthusiasm from the 30-year-old Texan, who appears to be saving his sunny-side-up for a rainier day than this one. </p> <p>The McConaughey effect has been slow burning as a mosquito coil. It is four years since his performance as a campaigning lawyer in Joel Schumacher's A Time to Kill propelled him onto the cover of four magazines, including Vanity Fair, within a single month in 1996. But subsequent ill-aligned castings in Amistad and Contact did not serve to secure his footing as young pretender, while his homely hedonism signalled neither edge nor ease cleanly enough. The twinkly precision he displayed in Ron Howard's EDtv, as an every-bloke who stars in the access-all-hours show of his life, was unluckily adrift in the aftermath of The Truman Show. </p> <p>The \"new Newman\" sobriquet may be ragged at the toes, but there remains a suspicion that McConaughey's vivid and instinctual star quality could yet ignite Hollywood's fickle tinder. Meanwhile, the man whose \"innate integrity and elegance\" so impressed Schumacher, remains keenly philosophical on the dynamic nexus between chance and self-determination. </p> <p>\"I think if you rely on Fate, it bites you in the butt. If you blow in the wind, you're going to get dropped in the gutter. But responsibility is when you create your own weather. Whether it's the people you hang out with, the places you choose to go, the things you choose to do, you have to be responsible to it, and the more responsible you are, the more Lady Luck, she shines on you. It's circular. It keeps coming back and regurgitates.\" </p> <p>McConaughey's latest screen offering is the hot oil and deep water U-571. Heavy on incidental orchestrals and light on historical exactitude, it tells the ripping yarn of a daring US navy mission during the second world war to capture a secret Nazi coding device from a German U-boat. McConaughey plays an ambitious but compassionate officer who, following the demise of his captain, discovers that commanding his depleted crew demands tough decisions and tougher to deliver dialogue. And it reminds the viewer why there are so few great submarine movies. </p> <p>He is certainly at one with the masculine imperative of the role. \"I liked being the guy who took action; I was happy to see the dexterity of Andrew Tyler, to give an order here, receive information here, while doing this job there. I liked the dance.\" His character was the kind of leader he would like to be. \"I've been asked a lot whether I would want to serve my country. For the right reason, the right cause, it would be an honour. And, yes, I would like to be the one in command. </p> <p>\"I think that I'm equipped as well as anyone. I trust myself to make the right decision at a time like that, objectively. I'm not a tyrant, I'm not follyful, I think I'm very fair-minded, and I'm not the guy who will lock up under pressure,\" he expounds, with the amiable certainty of a 16-year-old on a Sega. He is blurry on the question of historical accuracy. U-571 would appear to be based upon the first capture of an Enigma machine at sea by the British Navy, six months before America entered the war, and the film includes a mollifying dedication to \"all the Allied sailors who captured Enigma machines\". </p> <p>But there is only a responsibility to historical truths if a film presents itself as a biography or documentary, he argues. \"A lot of people go to films for the legitimate reason of escaping somewhere. We're storytellers, they're yarns.\" </p> <p>McConaughey is, for all intents and purposes, a babe; though it is hard to fathom in his present begrudging slump. His perfectly pumped muscle groups seem to be in the right order, as a forlorn flower wilts atop his jacket pocket like a forgotten friend. The blond curls are slicked into submission, and his eyes wash over one with all the engagement and urgency of day-old bath water getting past a drain blockage. His soft, low drawl, at least, is charming. </p> <p>He admits to being \"pretty ambitious\". Whether U-571 will augment his possibilities remains moot, but it has taken more in its first week in the US than EDtv made throughout its release. One cultivates an indifference for the box office, he says. \"I learnt that lesson with EDtv - that movie was backed, marketed, had all kinds of money on it, and it just bombed. I thought we had a home run. On the opening weekend of U-571, I'd done everything I could, I was happy that people agreed, but it didn't improve the quality of my day.\" </p> <p>He is equivocal about the notion of passion for acting. \"Would I survive without it? Sure. Is it my end all? No. But it is my vocation, my occupation, it's what I grow through, and where I experiment. To what extent I'm giving back to the world through it I don't know, but it's my avenue of communication.\" His favourite art, he adds, is the art of living. </p> <p>He's currently working on several projects of his own, including a biopic of his childhood hero, Evel Knievel. But rather poignantly, his first movie - the 70s-set high school stoner romp Dazed and Confused, which he made in 1993 - remains his favourite. \"There's nothing like the first time,\" he says wistfully, \"and I learned it the right way. I worked with great people, learnt to improvise. It was so pure, and really innocent. It worked.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, one might hazard that he'll keep on moving any which way he can, though probably with curtains shut. McConaughey was arrested last year while playing the bongos naked in his living room, and spent the night in police custody, although all charges, including that of possession of marijuana, were subsequently dropped. </p> <p>He continues to play the bongos, both clothed and unclothed, and enjoys any music with bass and percussion. \"I play my stomach and chest a lot. Depending on how much air I leave in my stomach and how high I go on my chest it makes four different drums.\" (No, he won't do it to order, although he does offer a weedy whistle instead.) He is ambivalent about cannabis legalisation. \"It's been proven to be harmless if used responsibly. But I've seen people smoke themselves into such complacency. You've got to do something with your day.\" </p> <p>As he talks, he is fiddling with what at first glance looks like an unravelled tampon. But as he is about to insist that his strength as an actor lies in \"the ability to be the man's man\" one must charitably assume it's something for cleaning guns. He is from the south after all. </p> <p>The youngest of three brothers, McConaughey was raised on Methodism and manners in Uvalde, Texas. He originally went to the state university in Austin to study law, before switching to film studies after a year. He continues to reside there and, though mildly wary of the good ole boy persona, his truths are so homespun one can still see the thumbprints. </p> <p>\"I get asked, so are you a cowboy? Well, yeah, I'm a cowboy. I don't wear boots or a cowboy hat, but I hop in my car and go on cross-country road trips with myself all the time.\" </p> <p>Spontaneity remains paramount. \"I'm the guy who may give you a better present on Tuesday than on your birthday. I don't like being programmed. If I see something that reminds me of you, I'm gonna get it and give it to you tomorrow. It reminds me of that Willie Nelson lyric, 'I'd rather give you a puppy than diamonds and gold'.\" A good reason to leave town on a Monday night, then.</p> <p>\u0095 U-571 opens next Friday.</p>",

I'm not a tyrant, I'm not follyful, I think I'm very fair-minded, and I'm not the guy who will lock up under pressure,\" he expounds, with the amiable certainty of a 16-year-old on a Sega. He is blurry on the question of historical accuracy. U-571 would appear to be based upon the first capture of an Enigma machine at sea by the British Navy, six months before America entered the war, and the film includes a mollifying dedication to \"all the Allied sailors who captured Enigma machines\". But there is only a responsibility to historical truths if a film presents itself as a biography or documentary, he argues. \"A lot of people go to films for the legitimate reason of escaping somewhere. We're storytellers, they're yarns.\" McConaughey is, for all intents and purposes, a babe; though it is hard to fathom in his present begrudging slump. His perfectly pumped muscle groups seem to be in the right order, as a forlorn flower wilts atop his jacket pocket like a forgotten friend. The blond curls are slicked into submission, and his eyes wash over one with all the engagement and urgency of day-old bath water getting past a drain blockage. His soft, low drawl, at least, is charming. He admits to being \"pretty ambitious\". Whether U-571 will augment his possibilities remains moot, but it has taken more in its first week in the US than EDtv made throughout its release. One cultivates an indifference for the box office, he says. \"I learnt that lesson with EDtv - that movie was backed, marketed, had all kinds of money on it, and it just bombed. I thought we had a home run. On the opening weekend of U-571, I'd done everything I could, I was happy that people agreed, but it didn't improve the quality of my day.\" He is equivocal about the notion of passion for acting. \"Would I survive without it? Sure. Is it my end all? No. But it is my vocation, my occupation, it's what I grow through, and where I experiment. To what extent I'm giving back to the world through it I don't know, but it's my avenue of communication.\" His favourite art, he adds, is the art of living. He's currently working on several projects of his own, including a biopic of his childhood hero, Evel Knievel. But rather poignantly, his first movie - the 70s-set high school stoner romp Dazed and Confused, which he made in 1993 - remains his favourite. \"There's nothing like the first time,\" he says wistfully, \"and I learned it the right way. I worked with great people, learnt to improvise. It was so pure, and really innocent. It worked.\" Meanwhile, one might hazard that he'll keep on moving any which way he can, though probably with curtains shut. McConaughey was arrested last year while playing the bongos naked in his living room, and spent the night in police custody, although all charges, including that of possession of marijuana, were subsequently dropped. He continues to play the bongos, both clothed and unclothed, and enjoys any music with bass and percussion. \"I play my stomach and chest a lot. Depending on how much air I leave in my stomach and how high I go on my chest it makes four different drums.\" (No, he won't do it to order, although he does offer a weedy whistle instead.) He is ambivalent about cannabis legalisation. \"It's been proven to be harmless if used responsibly. But I've seen people smoke themselves into such complacency. You've got to do something with your day.\" As he talks, he is fiddling with what at first glance looks like an unravelled tampon. But as he is about to insist that his strength as an actor lies in \"the ability to be the man's man\" one must charitably assume it's something for cleaning guns. He is from the south after all. The youngest of three brothers, McConaughey was raised on Methodism and manners in Uvalde, Texas. He originally went to the state university in Austin to study law, before switching to film studies after a year. He continues to reside there and, though mildly wary of the good ole boy persona, his truths are so homespun one can still see the thumbprints. \"I get asked, so are you a cowboy? Well, yeah, I'm a cowboy. I don't wear boots or a cowboy hat, but I hop in my car and go on cross-country road trips with myself all the time.\" Spontaneity remains paramount. \"I'm the guy who may give you a better present on Tuesday than on your birthday. I don't like being programmed. If I see something that reminds me of you, I'm gonna get it and give it to you tomorrow. It reminds me of that Willie Nelson lyric, 'I'd rather give you a puppy than diamonds and gold'.\" A good reason to leave town on a Monday night, then. \u0095 U-571 opens next Friday.",

      "body": "<p>If the British film industry were a football team, they'd have spent three times what Manchester United spend in one season on players... with the success of Watford. If you think I'm exaggerating, the London Evening Standard has a running total on how much lottery money has been spent on British films. At present, the figure is \u00a3100m. </p> <p>Why are British films so terrible? So stunningly, excruciatingly, exquisitely bad? Alan Parker, the new film tsar, blames the scripts. The \"high concept\", Cecil B DeMille once said, can be scribbled on the back of a cigarette packet. But most Brit-flicks have the entire script actually scribbled on the back of a cigarette packet, written in the time it took for someone to buy a drink at Soho House. </p> <p>Next week sees the release of a film that could change the British film industry's fortunes. (How many times have you heard that before?) On paper, Maybe Baby has plenty going for it: a script by Ben Elton (disliked by the critics, but still a crowd-puller). Hugh Laurie and Joely Richardson playing a childless couple who embark on infertility treatment - with hilarious consequences! </p> <p>Maybe Baby is the Platonic ideal of a Brit-flick. It is Peter's Friends, 10 years on: the generation ensemble movie with everyone present and politically correct: Dawn; Rowan; Jo-Jo Lummers; darling Joely and the Hugh that isn't Grant. </p> <p>But since Peter's Friends, Ben's gang has been replaced by a new generation of lottery-flush actors and writers. The king and queen of the scene are Jude Law and Sadie Frost, who met on the set of that ram-raiding disaster, Shopping. It was during Shopping that Law perfected his latter-day Sid James persona: a little bit wooh/a little bit wey, the same in every single film. </p> <p>Law and Frost have a coterie of collaborators, the Primrose Hill mob, who appear in just about any film going, no matter how dreadful. It includes Sean Pertwee (Jon's son), who spent the whole of Shopping saying \"'Allo, Billy\" with the worst mockney accent since Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins. Pertwee also starred in that Brit-surfing classic, Blue Juice, set in the crazy teashop scene round St Ives and starring that inflatable actress, Catherine Zeta-Jones. It's good to have a small group of people you can blame for this incessant stream of terrible films, because one of the first questions you ask yourself when you see something like Blue Juice is: Why? And then, more to the point: Who? Who is to blame for this crime? </p> <p>Frost cannot go from one day to the next without appearing in a dog of a film. Because she has problems remembering which one she's in, Sadie makes life easier by having all her characters called Sadie. There was Sadie in Final Cut, and Sadie in Love, Honour &amp; Obey. Did I say Jude was in that too? Well, he was. Playing Jude, the Vogue readers' Jamie Theakston. </p> <p>Final Cut is physically unwatchable. In that sense, it's in a league of its own. Many bad films can be endured with a small amount of alcohol, but Final Cut is beyond drink. It's aversion therapy. Final Cut belongs to a clear sub-genre of Brit-flicks: the wobbly-super8-let's-just-get-all-our-showbiz-mates-together-and-arse-about movie (heavy on narration because action sequences require some cursory knowledge of film-making). It thinks it's Truffaut, but comes across as Grange Hill. </p> <p>Other sub-genres include: </p> <p>The Hardship Movie. Grubbing about in poverty with some of the biggest names in the business, such as Gary Oldman (Nil by Mouth) and Tim Roth (The War Zone) who, keen to outdo one another in the who-had-the-most-deprived-childhood, plunge to new depths of on-screen squalor.</p> <p>These sorts of films are the arty cinematic equivalent of Oprah and Roseanne claiming they were abused as children. It doesn't cut the Colman's. Shane Meadows (TwentyFourSeven) is a seasoned newcomer to this genre, but needs a big hit in Hollywood before he can make it truly down'n'dirty. He's also slightly too good with a camera, which he'll need to rectify if he's to make an authentic Brit-flick. </p> <p>Then there's The Clubbing Film: Human Traffic stands alone here, a towering giant amongst pigmies. Human Traffic was widely hyped as having the most authentic off-your-head scenes yet filmed (as if this was a recommendation). It's the kind of boast that puts club movies on the same footing as 3-D monster movies from the 1950s (\"most realistic 3-D beast with or without the glasses!\"). The film was as brainless as clubbing, and in that respect, was highly authentic. </p> <p>Clogging the system like hair in a drain, the most crowded Brit-flick category of all (bar Cockney Gangster): The Brit-Rom-Com (British Romantic Comedy) or Notting Hill movie. Such an illustrious lineage: This Year's Love, with Kathy Burke - as entertaining as rickets; Fanny &amp; Elvis, starring Kerry Fox (Shallow Grave) and Ray Winstone (hired by the Primrose Hill mob whenever they want a real actor to play a diamond geezer). Kerry drives a VW, looking like a mid-80s Nescaf\u00e9 ad, and Ray is a Jag man. Guess what? Opposites attract! Leading by a mile, however, is Martha Meet Frank, Daniel &amp; Laurence. With a plot shorter than the title, this film assembled the most obnoxious cast since The Railway Children. It was compelling like a road crash. </p> <p>This genre is also known as the Colin Firth movie. Interestingly, after Firth starred in Fever Pitch, the big Hollywood adaptation of High Fidelity, starring John Cusack and completely junking any Hornby element, demonstrates at a stroke why the US is the most successful movie-making nation on earth... and we are not. </p> <p>In Britain, the film would have been faithful to the book, but at some late-point in production, swerved uncontrollably towards schmaltz. The resulting compromise, so typical of Brit-flicks, is the cinematic equivalent of welding two cars together. Its one of the reasons Brit-flicks look so weird. </p> <p>The Americans, by contrast, have a fantastically fascistic rigour when it comes to the requirements of a formula movie. British directors, ably assisted by a huge slush fund of lottery cash, feel free to splash indulgently about in any subject matter they choose, unburdened by constraints like story or box-office success. </p> <p>This leads to a surreal breadth of subject matter. Brit-flicks are nothing if not wide-ranging. Out now! There's Simon Magus, an off-kilter comedy about living in mud (a gap-toothed take on Harrison Ford's Witness). Guru in Seven, a black commitment-comedy. Honest: All Saints packing shooters in a Ladybird book rendering of the late 60s. The Clandestine Marriage: costume romp starring ex-EastEnder Paul Nicholls (more wooden than the set). And The Last Yellow: Meantime updated and given the obligatory Professionals/kipper-tie references. Brothers is still an unknown quantity, but the portents aren't good. </p> <p>It's possible to see any combo of subjects in a Brit-flick, just so long as they're mad! And kooky! Seal-killing satire with a side-line in espionage and fish-keeping? Coming up (it won't be any good, or have made any money, but there'll be 12 copies at Blockbuster - all starring Samantha Janus). </p> <p>The unintentional template for all Brit flicks is Absolute Beginners, Julien Temple's cavernous musical adaptation of Colin MacInnes's beat novel. The film was a badly-lit mistake starring Patsy Kensit, but with its strange mix of over-choreographed action, low-rent acting and soaring ambition, it has provided Brit-flicks with their holy trinity. </p> <p>A therapist would say that film-makers unconsciously replicate the errors of their forebears, and so it has been with the descendants of Absolute Beginners. The current Brit-flick catastrophe, Circus, starring Eddie Izzard as kooky(!), mad(!) gangster (the funniest thing he's done for years) is pure Absolute Beginners. It's also, consciously, an attempt to gain some reflected ambience from A Clockwork Orange. The rape-operatics of Kubrick's classic have been mistakenly replicated in a thousand shit Brit-flicks. As a film that comments on the logical conclusion of banality as entertainment, however, A Clockwork Orange now looks less frightening than the kind of no-brain movie Kubrick was satirising. </p> <p>In order to see if any film, no matter how tasteless, rubbish and moronic could be made, I asked a film producer friend of mine (let's call him Crispin) to look at some treatments I'd knocked up. Crispin, you must remember, has just been given money to make a third lottery flop. Modern film producers have come to resemble bands cashing-in on the tail end of punk. Films like Circus are the Sham 69 of Brit-flicks: ludicrous tribute acts with the even more ludicrous good fortune to get made. </p> <p>Even Crispin knows his third film (a club movie - with \"a surreal edge\") will bomb without trace, but does he care? No. </p> <p>We meet in Soho House (of course) and I lay my ideas on the table. </p> <p><strong>Film Proposal One: The Score</strong></p> <p><strong>Me: </strong>\"It's about a Glaswegian teenage drug-addict who gets signed to Manchester United's youth team (under the wing of a fatherly talent scout). I know the title's crap, but that's deliberate.\" </p> <p><strong>Crispin: </strong>\"Not interested.\" </p> <p><strong>Me: </strong>\"Why not? It's got two key Brit-flick ingredients: drugs and football.\" </p> <p><strong>Crispin: </strong>\"Football is so 90s. Besides, you'd never get the access. United have their own TV franchise.\" </p> <p><strong>Me: </strong>\"We could try a smaller club. Maybe Port Vale or Tranmere Rovers?\" </p> <p>Crispin draws my attention to three football turkeys: When Saturday Comes with Sean Bean; The Match with Max Beesley, who used to be an acid jazz drummer; and Fever Pitch with Colin Firth. \"And there are plenty more dismal footie films where they came from.\" I withdraw without mentioning Best. </p> <p><strong>Film Proposal Two: Spitalfield Carrots</strong></p> <p><strong>Me: </strong>\"It's a romantic comedy about an organic stall holder who falls in love with a mysterious carrot-purchasing woman.\" </p> <p><strong>Crispin: </strong>\"I like it. East London is very now and the carrots are a quirky idea. Do they get political? It'd be nice to have them join Reclaim the Streets and trash McDonald's.\" </p> <p><strong>Me: </strong>\"Er, I dunno.\" </p> <p><strong>Crispin: </strong>\"Work on it.\" </p> <p>I'm so excited about Spitalfield Carrots, I don't even wait around to pitch Trance Killers, my club movie about two DJs who murder crowds with a deadly trance record, made from high-frequency noises. </p> <p>Crispin tells me that he's willing to pitch Spitalfield Carrots to the Film Council. \"Don't you think the title's a bit... off-putting?\" I ask Crispin, on the steps of Soho House. \"They made Rancid Aluminium, didn't they?\" he says, and turns on his Prada soft-shoe. </p> <p>Rancid Aluminium is the yardstick by which all things spiritual and temporal must now be judged. By universal consent, it is the worst film ever made in the UK. People who have seen it belong to an exclusive club. They cannot speak about the film, they simply shudder at its mention. </p> <p>In many ways, Rancid Aluminium is beyond criticism because it is very hard, even after several viewings, to work out what the hell is going on. Rhys Ifans (the smelly bloke from Notting Hill) is drawn into a convoluted plot by the Russian mafia (jaw-dropping performances by Steven Berkoff and Keith Allen). There's a lot of running around, reminiscent of a Benny Hill sketch; some Lock, Stock posturing; and the obligatory appearance of Sadie Frost, for once not playing a character called Sadie. </p> <p>The high point however, is the big-screen debut of Dani Behr, who plays the enigmatic \"Charlie\" with all the charm and presence of Dani Behr. She really is a name to watch for in the future. </p> <p>With films like Rancid Aluminium being released, is it any wonder that the Guardian-reading cinema audience are flocking back to world cinema? Three hours of a Patagonian sheep-herder alone on a hill is far preferable to another cockney gangster movie with an \"ironic\" appearance from Bobby Davro. </p> <p>In 30 years' time, a future Jonathan Ross will be curating cult seasons at the NFT of the very best of the worst of the Brit-flicks. Already, people have begun to hire video tapes of these films in a post-ironic way, pawing over each painful detail with relish. Brit-flicks will soon have all the obscure niche cool of Danish wrestling films from the 1950s. </p> <p>There's a scene in Ben Elton's Maybe Baby which encapsulates the truth about Brit-flicks. Ewan Proclaimer, an Irvine Welsh parody, played with karaoke Scottish accent by Tom Hollander (the diminutive fiance of Saffi in Absolutely Fabulous) attacks Hugh Laurie for rejecting his script, Sick Junkies. </p> <p>\"Tell me, you uptight English bastard. When did you last write a script? At least I know my script is shite, but what's more, I knew it was shite before you told me it was shite. Let me tell you, pal. My shite shits on your shite.\" </p> <p>Brit-flicks are shit-flicks because the whole process is motivated by the desire to out-dross your nearest rival. It's no way to run an industry, but somehow, it happened.</p> <p><strong>Brit films: five of the worst </strong></p> <p><strong> 1 Rancid Aluminum</strong></p> <p> A film so incomprehensible and deeply lacklustre in all departments that in The Editor's round-up of reviewers, it averaged one out of 10. Wannabe thriller with Sadie Frost and Rhys Ifans. And Dani Behr. </p> <p><strong> 2 Mad Cows</strong></p> <p> Anna Friel manages to dip below the underwhelming Land Girls and Rogue Trader in a shrill and desperate \"comedy\" with Joanna Lumley. </p> <p><strong>3 Fever Pitch</strong></p> <p> Colin Firth was the deeply tedious Arsenal fan, Ruth Gemmell his understandably miffed on-off love interest. Duller than a George Graham offside trap. </p> <p><strong> 4 Final Cut</strong></p> <p> Jude and Sadie as Jude and Sadie. Two Rays playing two Rays. It's improv, innit? </p> <p><strong> 5 Up 'n' Under</strong></p> <p> A crap pub rugby team has to win a match. They do. Er, that's it.</p>",

Crispin tells me that he's willing to pitch Spitalfield Carrots to the Film Council. \"Don't you think the title's a bit... off-putting?\" I ask Crispin, on the steps of Soho House. \"They made Rancid Aluminium, didn't they?\" he says, and turns on his Prada soft-shoe. Rancid Aluminium is the yardstick by which all things spiritual and temporal must now be judged. By universal consent, it is the worst film ever made in the UK. People who have seen it belong to an exclusive club. They cannot speak about the film, they simply shudder at its mention. In many ways, Rancid Aluminium is beyond criticism because it is very hard, even after several viewings, to work out what the hell is going on. Rhys Ifans (the smelly bloke from Notting Hill) is drawn into a convoluted plot by the Russian mafia (jaw-dropping performances by Steven Berkoff and Keith Allen). There's a lot of running around, reminiscent of a Benny Hill sketch; some Lock, Stock posturing; and the obligatory appearance of Sadie Frost, for once not playing a character called Sadie. The high point however, is the big-screen debut of Dani Behr, who plays the enigmatic \"Charlie\" with all the charm and presence of Dani Behr. She really is a name to watch for in the future. With films like Rancid Aluminium being released, is it any wonder that the Guardian-reading cinema audience are flocking back to world cinema? Three hours of a Patagonian sheep-herder alone on a hill is far preferable to another cockney gangster movie with an \"ironic\" appearance from Bobby Davro. In 30 years' time, a future Jonathan Ross will be curating cult seasons at the NFT of the very best of the worst of the Brit-flicks. Already, people have begun to hire video tapes of these films in a post-ironic way, pawing over each painful detail with relish. Brit-flicks will soon have all the obscure niche cool of Danish wrestling films from the 1950s. There's a scene in Ben Elton's Maybe Baby which encapsulates the truth about Brit-flicks. Ewan Proclaimer, an Irvine Welsh parody, played with karaoke Scottish accent by Tom Hollander (the diminutive fiance of Saffi in Absolutely Fabulous) attacks Hugh Laurie for rejecting his script, Sick Junkies. \"Tell me, you uptight English bastard. When did you last write a script? At least I know my script is shite, but what's more, I knew it was shite before you told me it was shite. Let me tell you, pal. My shite shits on your shite.\" Brit-flicks are shit-flicks because the whole process is motivated by the desire to out-dross your nearest rival. It's no way to run an industry, but somehow, it happened. Brit films: five of the worst 1 Rancid Aluminum A film so incomprehensible and deeply lacklustre in all departments that in The Editor's round-up of reviewers, it averaged one out of 10. Wannabe thriller with Sadie Frost and Rhys Ifans. And Dani Behr. 2 Mad Cows Anna Friel manages to dip below the underwhelming Land Girls and Rogue Trader in a shrill and desperate \"comedy\" with Joanna Lumley. 3 Fever Pitch Colin Firth was the deeply tedious Arsenal fan, Ruth Gemmell his understandably miffed on-off love interest. Duller than a George Graham offside trap. 4 Final Cut Jude and Sadie as Jude and Sadie. Two Rays playing two Rays. It's improv, innit? 5 Up 'n' Under A crap pub rugby team has to win a match. They do. Er, that's it.",

      "body": "<p> Can it really be true that Kevin Bacon is just a couple of months shy of his 42nd birthday? This actor, who first came to our attention in Barry Levinson's Diner 18 years ago, has maintained effectively the same faintly overlooked presence ever since: coiled, muscular, yet open and always youthful and verging on naivety, with an agreeable, intelligent identity that suggests an existence outside the world of acting. </p> <p>The classic definition of a star is someone with something missing rather than something extra and maybe Bacon has never had it missing, or not enough of it missing. Although he has always been a plausible leading player, actual stardom has always eluded him. Playing comedy could be an option for him of course: and yet he could be too subtle for the very broad neo-Jerry-Lewis style now in fashion and even the famous \"Six Degrees\" game is a slight on his abilities and achievements. He's not obscure enough for that to be interesting and you can play the six-removes game with anyone. (There used to be a similar game of being six handshakes away from Mao Zedong - you could win by getting within five handshakes of Edward Heath.) </p> <p>So it is with something of a pang that Bacon's fans will see him bestow his presence on Stir of Echoes: an efficient and entertaining ghost story updated from an old tale by Richard Matheson, who wrote the screenplay for The Incredible Shrinking Man and the novel on which Spielberg based Duel. </p> <p>Bacon plays Tom, a blue-collar Chicago guy who works for the telephone company, married with a five-year-old boy, and idly dreaming of making it as a rock musician. His wife Maggie (Kathryn Erbe) sours his mood by telling him she is pregnant again, placing his music ambitions even further out of reach and it is at this point that grouchy Tom is riled by his sister-in-law Illeana Douglas: another classic supporting player, whose jolie-laide looks condemn her to best-friend roles and making the leading lady look good. </p> <p>She says he is not open to new experiences, and in her New Agey way hypnotises him, causing the initially derisive Bacon to succumb utterly and undergo a terrifying sense of communicating with the dead. And this gives him something in common with his son Jake, who communicates with the great beyond also, whispering things like: \"Does it hurt being dead?\" </p> <p>Naturally, Stir of Echoes has elements of a Sixth Sense knock-off, especially when Bacon goes all cold and his breath condenses. But thankfully, it is not encumbered with a twist ending, and avoids all the silliness that finally sank Sixth Sense. </p> <p>And the moments in which a child is menaced by a dead person are enjoyably unpleasant, especially the scene in which little Jake is trying to watch HR Pufnstuf on TV but the ghost keeps changing the channel to the horror film that he's not allowed to watch - which keeps playing even when the deeply bewildered Jake has actually pulled the plug out of the wall. </p> <p>Bacon's own contact with the dead works best when it manifests itself in little glimpses of horror and desecration: the dreamed moment when a fingernail - perhaps Bacon's fingernail - is snapped off with a wince-inducing crack. And there is a clammy dream sequence in which Bacon visits the bathroom and seeing that one of his front teeth has gone completely rotten, colour of reddish mud, reaches into his mouth and after some effort pulls it out of his head together with a gout of blood. It is the most squeaming tooth scene since Richard Burton demonstrated John Hurt's utter physical abasement in the adaptation of Orwell's 1984 by pincering one of his teeth out with his finger and thumb. </p> <p>Bacon himself endures all this sturdily, looking far younger than his years, and with his shirt off, his musculature has only slightly less definition than it did in Apollo 13, but still in good nick, and perfectly in line with the Abs Tyranny of modern Hollywood. Added to this is a distinctly serviceable script by director David Koepp, who allows Ileana Douglas to tell Maggie chirpily: \"What you need is a young priest with smouldering good looks who can get you through all this!\" </p> <p>There is a workmanlike carpentry in Koepp's script and direction which satisfactorily launches moments of scariness and does not allow the narrative tension to sag or, as in The Sixth Sense, pitch into potholes of inconsistency and dullness. And Bacon is always an A-list player whose style elevates anything he's in. You can do a lot worse on a Friday night than this.</p>",
