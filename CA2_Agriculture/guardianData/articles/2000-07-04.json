The inhabitants have become inured to the smell just as they have to the abnormality of their domestic life. Red's mother is a distrait figure dreaming of her glory days in India. His son, Ded, is a wander-wit. The elder daughter, Dinah, is a drudge who has become, for all practical purposes, her father's wife.

When Red announces \"There was allas skullduggery in the valley\" I hear an echo of Aunt Ada Doom crying \"There have always been Starkadders at Cold Comfort.\" What rescues Carr's play from rustic melodrama is her pitying irony and poetic skill. The former is shown by Red's condemnation of low valley morality: the sin under discussion is precisely the paternal incest he himself practises. And when Dinah says: \"We're a respectable family, we love one another,\" you realise she is both wrapped in self-delusion and expressing a literal truth. </p> <p>Carr doesn't moralise about her characters: she sees them, if anything, as victims of a society in which wives were taught to see sex as a pious duty. And, oppressive as the play is, it is relieved by the writing's poetic grace. A widowed neighbour, who overcomes his loneliness by humanising his cat, talks of \"tears rolling off a her whiskers and pounding the pilla\".

Valerie Lilley as his mother, Cara Kelly as the submissive Dinah and Mary Murray as the ruined Sorrel all give flawless support.

Just think: for the price of one Matt Barrett, on his annual chief executive's salary of \u00a3850,000 plus the same again in bonuses, Barclays could afford to employ 170 extra counter staff. Vodafone could take on another 530 operators in its call centres by booting out Chris Gent and his \u00a36.36m salary and bonuses package, while SmithKline Beecham could afford 300 more chemists with departing chief executive Jan Leschly's \u00a32.2m remuneration package. </p> <p>Of course, people like Chris Gent and Matt Barrett get paid those sorts of sums to cut staff - the news of Barrett's bonus came out as Barclays announced it was closing 170 branches, bringing the number of jobs lost at the bank to more than 6,500 in the last year. On top of his basic salary and bonus, he is entitled to share options worth \u00a330.5m if Barclays meets its targets. When he was questioned by MPs earlier this year, Barrett estimated that the closures had saved \u00a310m, so he must be well on the way. </p> <p>But with the average chief executive's salary and bonus package worth 18 times the average worker's, according to one Warwick University study, the usual excuses for why they are worth their weight in gold are wearing a bit threadbare. (For any chief executive earning more than half a million and weighing in at less than 14 stone, that statistic is literally true.) At this year's annual shindig with Barclays' shareholders, Barrett was accosted by one elderly widow, indignant at hearing the news that, on top of his already extravagant salary, he had been paid \u00a3225,000 just for crossing the Atlantic from his native Canada and turning up at the office. </p> <p>\"Last September, I received a letter stating that circumstances beyond your control only allowed you to increase my widow's pension by \u00a31 a week. My husband died of a heart attack at the age of 57 in 1966 and I am in my 89th year,\" Jessie Bonner-Thomas told Barclays' annual meeting. \"But circumstances within your control allowed you to give Mr Barrett a \u00a31.3m hello.\" </p> <p>In response to Bonner-Thomas's outburst, Barclays' chairman, Sir Peter Middleton, gave the textbook corporate response. Barrett's pay was \"in line with industry standards\" particularly in North America where he was hired, Sir Peter explained. </p> <p>Barrett himself was in equally robust form when he met with MPs earlier this year to talk about fat cat pay. He told the Treasury select committee that he was worth every penny of it and that indeed he was a bargain. \"These are not ill-gotten gains,\" he said. </p> <p>The argument goes that top people's pay must be left to the market and with salaries in the United States dwarfing even the wildest dreams of most FTSE-100 CEOs, British firms must have a free hand to attract international talent. It's true that at any one time, around half the top-paid executives in Britain have been lured from US companies, suggesting that there is some kind of international market for chief executives. </p> <p>But is it true that companies pay only what the market demands? The Trades Union Congress points out that the real process of determining executives' pay is done by a small circle of people, all directors themselves with a vested interest in making sure that overall pay levels stay as high as possible. In theory, chief executives' pay is supposed to be decided by independent remuneration committees. In practice, the non-executive directors who sit on these committees are usually themselves directors of other companies. \"This creates a conflict of interest for the non-executive directors because they have a direct interest in boosting overall levels of executive remuneration,\" a recent TUC report said. </p> <p> Just 392 people make up the remuneration committees of 98 of the largest UK companies and 30 directors sit on more than one committee, according to a survey by the independent thinktank Labour Research. Pay-setting appears to be more of a \"you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours\" arrangement, rather than a fiercely competitive market. </p> <p>Even if pay packets for chief executives were truly decided in a competitive market, two things still rankle. First, unlike supermodels and sports stars who also earn stratospheric sums by most people's standards, the pay of top business people appears to bear little relationship to their performance. </p> <p>Once executives enter this magic circle, it seems that they earn the sums regardless of how good they are at their jobs. In fact, if things go wrong, they are often paid enormous amounts to disappear quietly - so-called golden parachute deals. </p> <p>NatWest's top man, Derek Wanless, for example, was given a \u00a33m payoff to clear his desk last year as the bank began its doomed attempt to fend off hostile takeover bids. Yet according to some commentators, Wanless was to blame for the predators circling around the bank - he had made several unwise acquisitions that opened NatWest up to threat of a takeover. Meanwhile, Dino Adriano, the former chief executive of Sainsbury, received a \u00a31.2m payoff earlier this year to sweeten his sacking after he had introduced a disastrous advertising campaign, allowed the company to be overtaken by Tesco and Asda, and participated in an ill-judged fly-on-the-wall TV programme. </p> <p>At a time when the chancellor of the exchequer is warning that excessive pay claims will spark inflation and force the Bank of England to push up interest rates, it is hard for ordinary workers to accept that they should show restraint when the top players are throwing moderation to the wind. Last year, CEOs' pay rose by 17.6%, according to research by Incomes Data Services. Over the same period, average earnings rose by around 5%. The pattern is the same across the Atlantic - Business Week estimates that if a US worker earning $25,000 in 1994 had got the same percentage increases as his or her boss, he or she would be earning $138,350 today. </p> <p>When it was in opposition, Labour made much of the exorbitant salaries earned by the heads of former public utilities. But in power, it has made much less noise about fat cats' pay. Last year, trade and industry secretary Stephen Byers said it was not for the government to dictate boardroom pay. \"To attract world-class players, we need to pay at world-class levels,\" he said. The only sop he offered to those offended by the size of corporate pay packets was the suggestion that shareholders should have to approve remuneration committees' reports. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Geoffrey Pook, the chief executive of Erewash council who lost his job to pay for five roadsweepers on \u00a3161 per week, has already found another post.

The company, which was yesterday named as RTL, is part of the reshaping of the Pearson media empire announced in April and unites 160 of Pearson programmes such as Baywatch and The Bill. Shares in RTL are to start trading on July 26, although it will not immediately enter the main FTSE 100 share index because only 10% of the entire company is being sold to investors. The group is expected later to increase the number of shares available to investors to above the 15% threshold required for inclusion in the crucial index, which is tracked by major investors. RTL is being formed by meshing together Pearson's television business with Luxembourg-based broadcast and radio group CLT-Ufa, owned by the Bertelsmann empire in Germany and GBL of Luxembourg. The formation of the company, which will be larger than Pearson, requires the approval of shareholders in Audofina, listed on the Luxembourg and Brussels stock exchanges and the 49% owner of CLT-Ufa, at meetings on July 24 and 25. As part of the plan to bolster the board of the new company ahead of the stock market flotation, Juan Abello Gallo, chairman of Spanish company Alcaliber, was yesterday named as non-executive chairman, while Martin Taylor, the former chief executive of Barclays bank and current chairman of WH Smith, was appointed a non-executive director. Didier Bellens, chief executive of the newly formed RTL, said the group would be well positioned in the rapidly consolidating European media sector. The established shareholders do not intend to reduce their holdings the company, which means that Pearson will own 22%, Bertelsmann approximately 37% and GBL 30%. The group, which will be based in Luxembourg, is expected to bolster its already large size by making acquisitions, particularly in continental Europe but also in other markets.",

      "body": "<p>If you haven't heard Russian opera sung by a Russian company, then you haven't really heard it at all. The line-up that the Kirov fielded for the first night of Mussorgsky's Khovanshchina was as strong as any you'll hear; and if you dropped a stone into some of these voices, it would take a very, very long time to reach the bottom. </p> <p>The Kirov has strength in numbers, and Khovanshchina, calling for a large chorus and several strong male principals, suits it very well. It's a historical epic on a similar scale as the better-known Boris Godunov, set during the troubled times leading to the accession of Peter the Great. In Mussorgsky's day it was forbidden to show any of the Romanov tsars on stage, so the actual figure of Peter wasn't part of his original conception - though the Kirov did bring him on stage to add to the impact of the closing bars of the penultimate act. The storybook backdrops, of forests, rivers and partly obscured domes, had already created quite an atmosphere. </p> <p>Khovanshchina has never caught on outside Russia to the same extent as Boris Godunov; it is perhaps less dramatically satisfying because there is no one really central role and therefore less of an opportunity to get inside the characters' heads. But the music is not to blame: in the hands of the Kirov orchestra, from the simplicity of Ivan Tersky's fluid clarinet solo right at the very start to the deafening gong clashes that closed two of the acts, the score sounded glorious. Under Valery Gergiev's baton the score became an organic creation, very much alive but never drawing overt attention to the mechanism creating it. </p> <p>The Kirov uses a different set of soloists every night - because it can. (How many British companies can say that?) Some of them swap between two principal roles, such as Gennady Bezzubenkov, who on this occasion was singing Dosifei with his mellifluous and seemingly bottomless bass voice, but for the next performance will sing Khovansky, the role taken this time by powerhouse bass Vladimir Vaneev. Golitsyn and Shaklovity were equally strongly sung by Gegam Grigorian and Nikolai Putilin, and Olga Borodina's Marfa was a delight, coaxing out all the role's melancholy in deep, liquid and seemingly effortless tone. </p> <p>The gremlins in the Royal Opera's surtitle machine unfortunately took over after only half an hour, prompting some rather unrestrained complaints from some areas of the auditorium. It was a testament to the Kirov that the opera still packed a dramatic punch even when most of the audience didn't have a clue what the words meant. </p> <p> Performances tomorrow and July 12. Box office: 020-7304 4000. </p>",

      "bodyText": "If you haven't heard Russian opera sung by a Russian company, then you haven't really heard it at all. The line-up that the Kirov fielded for the first night of Mussorgsky's Khovanshchina was as strong as any you'll hear; and if you dropped a stone into some of these voices, it would take a very, very long time to reach the bottom. The Kirov has strength in numbers, and Khovanshchina, calling for a large chorus and several strong male principals, suits it very well. It's a historical epic on a similar scale as the better-known Boris Godunov, set during the troubled times leading to the accession of Peter the Great. In Mussorgsky's day it was forbidden to show any of the Romanov tsars on stage, so the actual figure of Peter wasn't part of his original conception - though the Kirov did bring him on stage to add to the impact of the closing bars of the penultimate act. The storybook backdrops, of forests, rivers and partly obscured domes, had already created quite an atmosphere. Khovanshchina has never caught on outside Russia to the same extent as Boris Godunov; it is perhaps less dramatically satisfying because there is no one really central role and therefore less of an opportunity to get inside the characters' heads. But the music is not to blame: in the hands of the Kirov orchestra, from the simplicity of Ivan Tersky's fluid clarinet solo right at the very start to the deafening gong clashes that closed two of the acts, the score sounded glorious. Under Valery Gergiev's baton the score became an organic creation, very much alive but never drawing overt attention to the mechanism creating it. The Kirov uses a different set of soloists every night - because it can. (How many British companies can say that?) Some of them swap between two principal roles, such as Gennady Bezzubenkov, who on this occasion was singing Dosifei with his mellifluous and seemingly bottomless bass voice, but for the next performance will sing Khovansky, the role taken this time by powerhouse bass Vladimir Vaneev. Golitsyn and Shaklovity were equally strongly sung by Gegam Grigorian and Nikolai Putilin, and Olga Borodina's Marfa was a delight, coaxing out all the role's melancholy in deep, liquid and seemingly effortless tone. The gremlins in the Royal Opera's surtitle machine unfortunately took over after only half an hour, prompting some rather unrestrained complaints from some areas of the auditorium. It was a testament to the Kirov that the opera still packed a dramatic punch even when most of the audience didn't have a clue what the words meant. Performances tomorrow and July 12. Box office: 020-7304 4000.",

Last Friday morning, after the second semi-final, it was suddenly drained of colour. Twenty-four hours later it was spouting blue liquid, but without its former effervescence. </p> <p>Further along one of the boulevards, in the middle of a cluster of high-rise blocks, a giant image of an orange-shirted Edgar Davids, 40 storeys high, loomed from the glass curtain wall of an insurance office, the highest building in Rotterdam. On one side he appeared to be crashing into the glass. On the other, facing the city centre, he was emerging - a gigantic symbol of strength and victory, achieved through the correct choice of training shoes. In the wake of defeat the image still dominated the skyline. Now, however, its message seemed pathetically hollow. </p> <p>For the Dutch the point of Euro 2000 had been lost. And their experience, in the wake of bitter and unexpected defeat by Italy, provided a lesson not only for them but for all observers of the tournament, who could only have been struck by the unnecessary sense of disappointment in the air as Rotterdam reluctantly prepared to play host to the two foreign finalists. </p> <p>The locals tried to console themselves. \"We always lose,\" a young man remarked, \"but usually it's to the team that ends up winning.\" He was thinking of past experiences against Germany and Argentina. Not this time, though. Now, as in the last World Cup, they had lost to the team that was to lose the final, which is not so good. </p> <p>But he and lots of other Dutch football fans still seemed reluctant to concede that they had actually lost Thursday's match in the Amsterdam Arena. Just as they emerged from defeat in the World Cup finals of 1974 and 1978 feeling that they had, in fact, won a couple of moral victories over less deserving teams, now they were able to see beyond the physical reality of the shot from Dennis Bergkamp that came back off Francesco Toldo's right-hand post in the 13th minute, and the five missed penalties, and to perceive some deeper metaphysical truth to do with purity of motive and inherent worth, a truth that awarded them the real victory. </p> <p>They are fooling themselves, once more becoming the casualties of their own characteristic form of hubris. To win at football you have to convert your chances. By failing to score the goals that were there for the taking against Italy on Thursday, the Dutch players dishonoured and devalued their own talents in a way which was certainly regretted by those who admire the inherent qualities of their play and are reluctant to adopt an ironic post-modern attitude to the failure of a team to live up to its true worth. </p> <p>Since they are such a gifted generation it was sad to see them pass into history without earning the right to stand alongside some of their great predecessors. Now the likes of Davids and Bergkamp will forever be remembered as great mercenaries, individuals who did their best work wearing the shirts of clubs in the Italian, Spanish and English leagues but who could not summon the collective spirit to form a great national team. </p> <p>Quite possibly Frank Rijkaard's inexperience had something to do with this. For all his openness and intelligence, and despite his empathy with the players, it might have been better to give the job to a greybeard with a better idea of how to provoke and cajole them towards the ultimate success. It is not just in English football that such people are in short supply. </p> <p>But a greater culprit was the weight of public expectation, artificially exaggerated by the insistent commercial interests which projected images of Davids on to the sides of an office block and which in various other guises turned the country orange for the best part of a month. The fact of co-hosting the tournament came a distant second to the belief that the home team would emerge triumphant. In fact there were times when the tournament seemed to become merely an excuse for a demonstration of Dutch footballing superiority, even though their actual performance in the tournament only once - against the bizarre Yugoslavs - touched the heights. </p> <p>How different this was from France in 1998, when the host nation's public - footballing and otherwise - had no great belief in their own team's excellence but were prepared to be pleasantly surprised as the tournament went on and their representatives made progress. Celebration was the consequence of success. Never did they make the mistake of doing it in advance. As a result there was a real sense of delight in the discovery that their boys were, in fact, rather good at this game. </p> <p>Without advocating Belgium's alternative position, which was to show little public enthusiasm for their own team and even less interest in the tournament as a whole, it is possible to be deeply thankful, in this respect, that England will not be hosting the 2006 World Cup. At least the Dutch expectation of success had some basis in reality. Goodness knows what heights of self-delusion the English might have attained had they been approaching the competition with home advantage, buoyed up by the misleading popularity and prosperity of the Premier League. Ten years later, the violent expression of thwarted hopes that were seen in Trafalgar Square after defeat by Germany in the semi-final of Euro 96 might have been made to seem insignificant. </p> <p>Once England and Germany had gone, Euro 2000 was reclaimed for civilisation. And once Holland had been eliminated, it became nothing more nor less than a football tournament. No longer was it pretending to be some sort of cultural or national festival, with a preordained outcome. For three days we had a normal build-up to a normal match between two very gifted and reasonably well matched teams, their prospects discussed in rational terms even by their most passionate adherents. And when it was all over, we could get on with arguing about the wisdom or otherwise of Roger Lemerre's decision to leave out Nicolas Anelka and whether Filippo Inzaghi, similarly ignored by Dino Zoff, might have converted one or two of the chances to put Italy two goals ahead in the second half that were spurned by Alessandro del Piero. </p> <p>\"It was a clash of football cultures,\" Lemerre said later, before talking with calmness and good sense about evolution and continuity, and about how he hoped that over the next two years to the next World Cup the younger members in the French squad would continue to absorb valuable lessons from their elders. </p> <p>A clash of football cultures.

      "bodyText": "Conservative leader William Hague tonight produced a radical blueprint for education reform, with a blistering attack on \"bureaucracy and government diktats\". In his London speech Hague championed virtues like classroom discipline and school uniforms, but also unveiled a startling plan to pump money directly into schools, almost entirely bypassing the local education authorities (LEAs). The Tory leader claimed that under his formula, every school would get an average of \u00a3540 more per pupil, \"to spend as best they see fit\" - though they will have to cover costs presently paid by LEAs, like school transport. The extra money would be diverted from the LEAs and from the Department of Education, which Hague accused of lavishing money on \"gimmicks\". He promised that a Tory government would free teachers from the burden of bureaucracy. Though the national curriculum would stay, a plethora of plans and targets would be swept away. Hague said that three \"simple but radical\" principles would underly Conservative education policy: \u0095 Every school will be a Free School, free of bureaucratic and political control. \u0095 Every school will be accountable to its parents, who in turn will be free to apply to whichever school they want. \u0095 There will be \"diversity\", which Hague defined as nobody having a monopoly on the provision of education. The principle of diversity is likely to arouse the most controversy. According to Hague, the new Free Schools will be free to determine their own admissions policy - and if they wish they will be allowed to be wholly selective. \"That will mean that new grammar schools can be created, reversing a 30 year policy which has done more than anything else to lower standards in our state education system,\" he said. Hague also promised to \"sweep away the barriers\" between state and independent education. Companies, charities and religious groups would be allowed to run existing state schools, funded by the taxpayer. Independent foundations would also be allowed to build new, publicly funded, schools to run themselves. Hague described his own proposals as \"the most exciting and far-reaching development in state education since Rab Butler's 1944 Act\", and predicted that they would enrage the \"left-leaning liberal establishment\". In that he is doubtless right, for it was the 1944 Act which entrenched the division of secondary education between grammar schools and secondary moderns.

University College, London, Imperial College and the universities of Cambridge and Edinburgh all enjoyed increases of over \u00a310m.</p> <p>\u0095 King's College joins the elite group of research heavyweights, earning over \u00a3100m in research funds. University College, London, Imperial College and the universities of Cambridge and Oxford, all secured over \u00a3150m in research grants in 1998-99. The University Edindurgh attracted \u00a399.8m, just \u00a3200,000 short of the \u00a3100m mark.</p> <p>\u0095 Among the new universities, Lincolnshire and Humberside saw the biggest percentage increase, with research income up by over 75% to \u00a31.4m. The universities of Middlesex and Greenwich enjoyed the biggest absolute increases, both up by over \u00a32m, with total budgets in 1998-99 of \u00a35.5m and \u00a314.2m respectively.</p> <p>\u0095 Cranfield University saw the biggest drop in research funds, down by \u00a31.2m on the previous year to \u00a335.6m in total. Among the former polytechnics, Staffordshire, Westminster, and Manchester Metropolitan universities witnessed drops of income of \u00a30.8m, \u00a30.4m, and \u00a30.4m respectively, with 1998-99 budgets of \u00a33.2m, \u00a34.5m, and \u00a36.9m.</p> <p>\u0095 Overall research income for the academic sector was up 8.8% from \u00a32.6bn in 1997-98 to \u00a32.85bn in 1998-99. The biggest absolute increase in external research contracts was from charities, up by \u00a330m to \u00a3430m. Only the government's research councils allocated more research project grants to universities in 1998-99, spending \u00a3560m. Income from block grants supplied by the higher education funding council was up by \u00a3130m to \u00a31bn.</p> <p>University College, London emerges as the richest research university in the country, marking an end to the dominance of Oxford and Cambridge in the research funding stakes, according to the latest complete breakdown of academic research budgets. </p> <p>The four research giants which make up the golden triangle - Imperial College, University College, London, Oxford and Cambridge - remain in a super-league of their own in terms of research income. They attracted a quarter of the \u00a32.85bn research grants won by the UK academic sector in 1998-99, made up of about 100 universities. They are the only academic institutions earning over \u00a3150m a year in research project grants and contracts and general funding-council block grants. </p> <p>The latest official figures for external research income, registered by universities in 1998-99, come from the sector's official number-crunching outfit, the Higher Education Statistics Agency. Combined with block research grants from the higher education funding councils, which are allocated mainly on the back of the results of the Research Assessment Exercise, the overall figures provide the most up-to-date picture of research income for UK universities. Income from external research grants and contracts for the sector totalled \u00a31.8bn in 1998-99, while grants from the funding councils totalled \u00a31bn. </p> <p>The emergence of the large London universities at the top of the research funding table has been fuelled by recent mergers with medical schools in the capital. </p> <p>In 1998, UCL's medical school completed its merger with the Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine in Hampstead and with various postgraduate schools, including the Institute of Child Health, the Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery and the Eastman Dental Institute. Under the UCL banner these institutions won more than \u00a350m in charity income in 1998-99, \u00a310m more than Oxford and \u00a320m more than Cambridge. </p> <p>Imperial College has also developed into a heavyweight biomedical earner, merging with the Charing Cross and Westminster and National Heart and Lung hospitals, and the Royal Postgraduate Medical School, and securing \u00a332m in 1998-99. </p> <p>Biomedical research grants from charities make up an increasingly large share of academic research income. Charities chanelled \u00a3430m into universities in 1998-99, representing nearly one in four of all research grants and contracts - and this before the Wellcome Trust expanded its huge research budget. Despite government policies to focus resources into the highest research- rated research groups and university departments, charitable support is also the most skewed of all research funds: the four golden-triangle universities secured more than a third of a charity grants. </p> <p>But the big four perform well across the board. In terms of research council project grants - won through individual academic proposals - Cambridge, which gets \u00a343.5m, and Oxford top the rankings, but UCL and Imperial are not far behind. </p> <p>Overall the sector received \u00a3560m from research councils in 1998-99. The four also won most grants from the European Commission. When it comes to income from funding councils, distributed to institutions as one block grant, UCL pips the Oxbridge institutions for the highest ranked university, winning \u00a358.4m. </p> <p>It is only when figures are compiled for relatively smaller income streams, from government departments and industry, that this pattern changes. With an income of \u00a313.5m, King's College, London, emerges as the biggest winner of other government sources, including local health authorities. Other institutions performing well include UCL, Manchester and Birmingham. Cranfield University, for postgraduates, is the third-largest earner of grants from companies. Imperial tops this list, with \u00a315.8m on its books for 1998-99. </p> <p>The University of Greenwich is the highest research earner among former polytechnics. With \u00a314.1m, the new university has a larger income than a host of old universities. This is mainly through taking over the Natural Resources Institute. </p> <p>As a consequence of the increasing concentration of research funds on the academic elite, the south-east of the country is fast becoming the region of research riches. Bolstered by its own medical mergers, King's College enjoyed one of the biggest percentage increases in research income of all universities - up by 60% on the previous year. </p> <p>UCL, Imperial, Oxford and Cambridge, and King's by themselves won nearly 30% of all research grants in 1998-99, securing \u00a3800m in total. And all this before the government and the Wellcome Trust decided to locate a \u00a3500m synchrotron X-ray facility near Oxford, rather than in the north-west.</p>",

University College, London, Imperial College and the universities of Cambridge and Edinburgh all enjoyed increases of over \u00a310m. \u0095 King's College joins the elite group of research heavyweights, earning over \u00a3100m in research funds. University College, London, Imperial College and the universities of Cambridge and Oxford, all secured over \u00a3150m in research grants in 1998-99. The University Edindurgh attracted \u00a399.8m, just \u00a3200,000 short of the \u00a3100m mark. \u0095 Among the new universities, Lincolnshire and Humberside saw the biggest percentage increase, with research income up by over 75% to \u00a31.4m. The universities of Middlesex and Greenwich enjoyed the biggest absolute increases, both up by over \u00a32m, with total budgets in 1998-99 of \u00a35.5m and \u00a314.2m respectively. \u0095 Cranfield University saw the biggest drop in research funds, down by \u00a31.2m on the previous year to \u00a335.6m in total. Among the former polytechnics, Staffordshire, Westminster, and Manchester Metropolitan universities witnessed drops of income of \u00a30.8m, \u00a30.4m, and \u00a30.4m respectively, with 1998-99 budgets of \u00a33.2m, \u00a34.5m, and \u00a36.9m. \u0095 Overall research income for the academic sector was up 8.8% from \u00a32.6bn in 1997-98 to \u00a32.85bn in 1998-99. The biggest absolute increase in external research contracts was from charities, up by \u00a330m to \u00a3430m. Only the government's research councils allocated more research project grants to universities in 1998-99, spending \u00a3560m. Income from block grants supplied by the higher education funding council was up by \u00a3130m to \u00a31bn. University College, London emerges as the richest research university in the country, marking an end to the dominance of Oxford and Cambridge in the research funding stakes, according to the latest complete breakdown of academic research budgets. The four research giants which make up the golden triangle - Imperial College, University College, London, Oxford and Cambridge - remain in a super-league of their own in terms of research income. They attracted a quarter of the \u00a32.85bn research grants won by the UK academic sector in 1998-99, made up of about 100 universities. They are the only academic institutions earning over \u00a3150m a year in research project grants and contracts and general funding-council block grants. The latest official figures for external research income, registered by universities in 1998-99, come from the sector's official number-crunching outfit, the Higher Education Statistics Agency. Combined with block research grants from the higher education funding councils, which are allocated mainly on the back of the results of the Research Assessment Exercise, the overall figures provide the most up-to-date picture of research income for UK universities. Income from external research grants and contracts for the sector totalled \u00a31.8bn in 1998-99, while grants from the funding councils totalled \u00a31bn. The emergence of the large London universities at the top of the research funding table has been fuelled by recent mergers with medical schools in the capital. In 1998, UCL's medical school completed its merger with the Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine in Hampstead and with various postgraduate schools, including the Institute of Child Health, the Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery and the Eastman Dental Institute. Under the UCL banner these institutions won more than \u00a350m in charity income in 1998-99, \u00a310m more than Oxford and \u00a320m more than Cambridge. Imperial College has also developed into a heavyweight biomedical earner, merging with the Charing Cross and Westminster and National Heart and Lung hospitals, and the Royal Postgraduate Medical School, and securing \u00a332m in 1998-99. Biomedical research grants from charities make up an increasingly large share of academic research income. Charities chanelled \u00a3430m into universities in 1998-99, representing nearly one in four of all research grants and contracts - and this before the Wellcome Trust expanded its huge research budget. Despite government policies to focus resources into the highest research- rated research groups and university departments, charitable support is also the most skewed of all research funds: the four golden-triangle universities secured more than a third of a charity grants. But the big four perform well across the board. In terms of research council project grants - won through individual academic proposals - Cambridge, which gets \u00a343.5m, and Oxford top the rankings, but UCL and Imperial are not far behind. Overall the sector received \u00a3560m from research councils in 1998-99. The four also won most grants from the European Commission. When it comes to income from funding councils, distributed to institutions as one block grant, UCL pips the Oxbridge institutions for the highest ranked university, winning \u00a358.4m. It is only when figures are compiled for relatively smaller income streams, from government departments and industry, that this pattern changes. With an income of \u00a313.5m, King's College, London, emerges as the biggest winner of other government sources, including local health authorities. Other institutions performing well include UCL, Manchester and Birmingham. Cranfield University, for postgraduates, is the third-largest earner of grants from companies. Imperial tops this list, with \u00a315.8m on its books for 1998-99. The University of Greenwich is the highest research earner among former polytechnics. With \u00a314.1m, the new university has a larger income than a host of old universities. This is mainly through taking over the Natural Resources Institute. As a consequence of the increasing concentration of research funds on the academic elite, the south-east of the country is fast becoming the region of research riches. Bolstered by its own medical mergers, King's College enjoyed one of the biggest percentage increases in research income of all universities - up by 60% on the previous year. UCL, Imperial, Oxford and Cambridge, and King's by themselves won nearly 30% of all research grants in 1998-99, securing \u00a3800m in total. And all this before the government and the Wellcome Trust decided to locate a \u00a3500m synchrotron X-ray facility near Oxford, rather than in the north-west.",

Well this represents the transfer activities of club A and club B. But for our purposes, we'll call them Newcastle and Spurs.</p> <p>Now club A, that's Newcastle, have a strong interest in Belgian johnny Emile Mpenza. I will denote him with an X. According to reports in the North East, manager Bobby Robson and chairman Freddie Shepherd are today in Germany (I think we all know where that is, what?!) talking over an \u00a38m move with his club FC Schalke. But according to reports in London, which I will denote with an X, Spurs are hoping to hijack the deal. Hijack! Where?</p> <p>According to my chappie on the inside, person X would prefer a move to destination X, a transfer I will denote with an X. \"Emile told me that Schalke is OK but he doesn't feel very comfortable in Germany\", whispered Belgian agent Marc Wilmots. \"He would like to sign the contract with Tottenham within the next few days.\"</p> <p>Which could leave Newcastle fishing in the canal with a spatula. But, be prepared, cub scout law, Newcastle have a dashed cunning back-up plan. Yes, they have Wimbledon's Carl Cort in their cross hairs. Like Mpenza, this chappy bunks in Lanky House, so I will denote his long legs with an X. But, and I will denote this back door banditry with an X, the jolly Magpies face competition from a rival club who want to sign not only Cort but Dons full-back Ben Thatcher too.</p> <p>\"We are not denying we have been speaking to Wimbledon and it is true that we have an offer on the table,\" said the director of football at this mystery club. \"We are waiting to see if the bid is accepted so that we can speak to the players.\" But who are these bally fiends, whom I will denote with an X?

But keep it to yourselves - careless talk costs quids don't you know.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"I thought Desailly had become a man, but he's remained a horse, trotting along with blinkers on. They (the French team) had no respect for the defeated. They are extremely arrogant.\" Italy's Fabio Cannavaro certainly isn't bitter.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>THE LEGACY OF LONELY NIC</strong></p> <p>Robert Pires's move to Arsenal had been called off more times than Filippo Inzaghi when the French international winger finally signed for the Gunners yesterday and said: \"The past month [ie 24 hours] has been a dream for me. First to win Euro 2000 and now to join such a great club as Arsenal.\" These remarks warmed the hearts of miserable Gooners everywhere, who had thought that the 26-year-old would rather have played for Madrid. Which is obviously preposterous.</p> <p>\"I would have preferred to have played for Real Madrid,\" Pires said today, as he opened his heart to slightly obsessive Spanish sports daily Marca. \"It has been a dream for me to play for Real Madrid since I was small.\" Oh. So why did you join Arsenal then? \"I have been talking to Wenger since last December. His words gave me more security I didn't want what happened to Anelka to happen to me as well.\" That's the Anelka who moaned about the Gunners, got a move to the club he wanted, sulked for half of last season and still got into Real's Big Cup first team. The words \"molly\" and \"coddle\" spring to mind.</p> <p>So Pires has joined the Gunners because they'll be nice to him. Which is nice. Because by all accounts the 26-year-old's career hasn't been an unending sequence of waltzes past top Italian defenders. His big move from Metz to Marseille failed to live up to expectations, and as captain he nearly steered l'OM to relegation last season. Aime Jacquet also said once that Pires was \"too much of a nice guy and not enough of a warrior\". That's as maybe, but he's certainly great at PR.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Chelsea have been offered Brazilian striker Edmundo for \u00a36m reports the Sun. The troubled 28-year-old Vasco da Gama star wants to leave the club after rows with team-mates. But whether Chelsea need another striker - or want to buy the man dubbed \"The Animal\" - is another matter.</p> <p>And do Arsenal really need another striker? Yes they do, according to Planet Football, who suggest that Sylvain Wiltord could be Arsenal's fourth major capture of the close season.</p> <p>Emmanuel Petit is a target for Barcelona, according to Planet Football's \"Spanish sources\". \"Barcelona is a great team, with massive ambition, and it is a perfect club for me,\" was Petit's view before Euro 2000. </p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>NEWS IN BRIEF</strong></p> <p>Home Secretary Jack Straw will announce proposals to stop England hooligans causing mayhem abroad during the team's World Cup qualifying campaign later today.

According to my chappie on the inside, person X would prefer a move to destination X, a transfer I will denote with an X. \"Emile told me that Schalke is OK but he doesn't feel very comfortable in Germany\", whispered Belgian agent Marc Wilmots. \"He would like to sign the contract with Tottenham within the next few days.\" Which could leave Newcastle fishing in the canal with a spatula. But, be prepared, cub scout law, Newcastle have a dashed cunning back-up plan. Yes, they have Wimbledon's Carl Cort in their cross hairs. Like Mpenza, this chappy bunks in Lanky House, so I will denote his long legs with an X. But, and I will denote this back door banditry with an X, the jolly Magpies face competition from a rival club who want to sign not only Cort but Dons full-back Ben Thatcher too. \"We are not denying we have been speaking to Wimbledon and it is true that we have an offer on the table,\" said the director of football at this mystery club. \"We are waiting to see if the bid is accepted so that we can speak to the players.\" But who are these bally fiends, whom I will denote with an X? Why none other than the Hotspurs of Tottenham. Yes, the very same! So X +X times X minus X = X. But keep it to yourselves - careless talk costs quids don't you know. * * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"I thought Desailly had become a man, but he's remained a horse, trotting along with blinkers on. They (the French team) had no respect for the defeated. They are extremely arrogant.\" Italy's Fabio Cannavaro certainly isn't bitter. * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE LEGACY OF LONELY NIC Robert Pires's move to Arsenal had been called off more times than Filippo Inzaghi when the French international winger finally signed for the Gunners yesterday and said: \"The past month [ie 24 hours] has been a dream for me. First to win Euro 2000 and now to join such a great club as Arsenal.\" These remarks warmed the hearts of miserable Gooners everywhere, who had thought that the 26-year-old would rather have played for Madrid. Which is obviously preposterous. \"I would have preferred to have played for Real Madrid,\" Pires said today, as he opened his heart to slightly obsessive Spanish sports daily Marca. \"It has been a dream for me to play for Real Madrid since I was small.\" Oh. So why did you join Arsenal then? \"I have been talking to Wenger since last December. His words gave me more security I didn't want what happened to Anelka to happen to me as well.\" That's the Anelka who moaned about the Gunners, got a move to the club he wanted, sulked for half of last season and still got into Real's Big Cup first team. The words \"molly\" and \"coddle\" spring to mind. So Pires has joined the Gunners because they'll be nice to him. Which is nice. Because by all accounts the 26-year-old's career hasn't been an unending sequence of waltzes past top Italian defenders. His big move from Metz to Marseille failed to live up to expectations, and as captain he nearly steered l'OM to relegation last season. Aime Jacquet also said once that Pires was \"too much of a nice guy and not enough of a warrior\". That's as maybe, but he's certainly great at PR. * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Chelsea have been offered Brazilian striker Edmundo for \u00a36m reports the Sun. The troubled 28-year-old Vasco da Gama star wants to leave the club after rows with team-mates. But whether Chelsea need another striker - or want to buy the man dubbed \"The Animal\" - is another matter. And do Arsenal really need another striker? Yes they do, according to Planet Football, who suggest that Sylvain Wiltord could be Arsenal's fourth major capture of the close season. Emmanuel Petit is a target for Barcelona, according to Planet Football's \"Spanish sources\". \"Barcelona is a great team, with massive ambition, and it is a perfect club for me,\" was Petit's view before Euro 2000. * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Home Secretary Jack Straw will announce proposals to stop England hooligans causing mayhem abroad during the team's World Cup qualifying campaign later today. Ministers hope to rush through the legislation before parliament breaks for its summer recess on July 28. German World Cup 2006 ambassador Franz Beckenbauer has attacked the deal struck between South Africa and Brazil ahead of Thursday's vote for 2006 World Cup. \"That deal is offensive,\" he blasted. \"It is horse-trading and means that we have probably lost the bid.\" Newcastle United have unveiled a blueprint for greater harmony with its supporters. The author, Rogan Taylor, has suggested that the club should meet the costs of the six bondholders who lost their High Court action over their seats, and create a 300-strong forum of fans to air supporters' grievances. Norwegian club Valerenga have turned down a chance to take Paul Gascoigne on loan from Middlesbrough. \"We are not a summer rehabilitation centre,\" said chairman Morten Grodhal. Lennie Lawrence has left Luton after the club's new owners decided a fresh approach was needed. Steve Watson hopes his \u00a32.5m move to Everton from Aston Villa will help relaunch his England career. \"Three or four times in the season before I signed for Villa I was in the full squad,\" he said. \"Once you've had a taste of it, as any footballer will tell you, you want more of it.\" Leicester City boss Peter Taylor today wrapped the \u00a33million signing of Gary Rowett from Birmingham. Charlton defender Anthony Barness has signed a three-year deal with Bolton. Stuart McCall has agreed to become Bradford's new assistant manager. * * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO Sky Sports One: Beach soccer (6.30pm) At last, it's back (and in case you miss it, it's also on at 10.15pm and 2 in the morning).

The families claimed at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg that Britain broke war conventions by torpedoing the Belgrano.

Tam Dalyell, the Labour MP who was one of a small group of backbenchers who protested about the sinking at the time and who helped uncover the truth about the sinking, backed the relatives' account. \"Mrs Thatcher did not want to be denied a military victory - which was what the Falklands war was more about than helping the Falklanders,\" he said.

      "body": "<p>Bologna, the Italian city famous for having more arcades than anywhere else in Europe, also had probably the largest collection of fertility experts anywhere on the planet last week. A glance at the crowded lecture theatres of Bologna's conference centre would suggest they must be proliferating faster than embryo cells can divide. </p> <p>If there is a growth industry within medicine, this is it. The European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology, whose annual conference this was, was buzzing with the excitement of being at the cutting edge. Only 20 years since the birth of Louise Brown, the first test-tube baby, the technology has galloped ahead so fast that one baby in around 80 in the UK is now born with laboratory help, while in the Nordic countries, it is one in 50. </p> <p>What does this say about human fertility? In spite of millions of years of practice, are we losing the ability to make babies in the ordinary way of the species? There are some who say we are. </p> <p>Environmentalists point the finger at sperm counts, which some studies have shown to be dropping. There are huge anxieties over the effects of \"gender-bending\" chemicals - scientifically known as endocrine disruptors. These are man-made substances used in plastics, dyes, solvents, resins, paints, plastic containers, detergents and pharmaceuticals. They are highly pollutant, break down very slowly and accumulate in the fatty tissues of the human body. </p> <p>Worst of all, they mimic the female hormone oestrogen or interfere with the male hormone testosterone. Birds and fish living in areas such as near paper mills, where quantities of these chemicals are released into the water, have been found to have reproductive defects. WWF (the World Wide Fund for Nature) believes that there is sufficient evidence to indict these pollutants for some male infertility problems, such as declining sperm counts. </p> <p>But scientific studies have not yet come up with clear answers. Some have shown alarming drops in the numbers and motility (swimming ability) of sperm. Others have not. While some European studies suggest drops of 50% or more in the second half of the 20th century, a major American study from the Keck school of medicine at the University of Southern California, published in March, found nothing of the sort. Semen samples from 1,385 men who were seeking fertility treatment between 1994 and 1997 - a group that might be expected to have low sperm counts - turned out to have more than the usual amount of abnormalities in their sperm, but sperm quantities no different from the average in the 1950s. </p> <p>Furthermore, all these men were blue collar workers who would have been more likely than most to be exposed to industrial pollutants in their jobs. The Medical Research Council's reproductive biology unit in Scotland is now embarking on a major study to try to find some definitive answers, recruiting 1,000 men to send in samples of their sperm by post for analysis. </p> <p>There has been some evidence that sperm counts rise as well as fall over the years, and that high counts result in high birth rates. Some say particular professional groups are more likely to have problems - the wives of taxi drivers and lorry drivers whose scrotums overheat during the hours on the road are said to have more problems than most. But the same should go for any sedentary lifestyle. Tight pants have also been blamed. While there is every reason to worry about the effects of polluting chemicals on the planet, most fertility doctors tend to dismiss suggestions that falling sperm counts are a reason for their rapidly increasing workload. Lord Winston, in his book \"Making Babies\", says: \"There is very little serious evidence at all that men are less fertile now than they used to be.\" Not only were sperm counting techniques entirely different in the 1950s - the period usually used as the baseline - but also the social and economic background of men that attended fertility clinics, he says. </p> <p>Last month a study in the Lancet medical journal turned the argument on its head when it reported that couples were conceiving faster than they used to. Michael Joffe, an epidemiologist at Imperial College school of medicine in London, interviewed 646 men and 894 women aged 16 to 59, asking them to recall how long it took to achieve their first pregnancy. While he admits that asking people to think back four decades is not foolproof, he found a clear trend that more women were conceiving within four to six months of trying for a baby in the early 90s than they were in the early 60s - 80% compared with 65%. They are not having more or better sex (some experts believe orgasm is more likely to lead to conception), Joffe says - they have better timing. Couples today more often try to have sex on the days the woman is ovulating. </p> <p>\"Another conclusion should be that, at present, the near-panic sometimes expressed in the lay press about the effects of environmental pollution on sperm quality and male fertility is not justified,\" said an editorial in the Lancet. That was Egbert de Velde's view at the Bologna conference. The Dutch gynaecologist was deeply concerned that couples are rushing into fertility treatment that is not only expensive but can be dangerous. Women have died from hyper-stimulation - the effects of the chemical battering given to their ovaries to make them produce more than the normal one egg in a cycle. </p> <p>\"A lot of couples who have tried for half a year give up, thinking it is not normal and rush to do the fertility thing. Because infertility, especially in the US, is extremely commercialised, they are accepted with open arms. I think that is a development that is regrettable because a lot of couples, if they had waited - not for many years but for another year - would have quite a big chance of conceiving spontaneously without all the risks and complications of IVF,\" says de Velde. </p> <p> Commercially, IVF is big news. There were more than 200,000 treatment cycles of IVF and ICSI (the technique where a single sperm is injected into an egg) carried out in Europe in 1997, at a cost to the individual or the state of around \u00a33,000 a time. Organon, Serono and the other big names involved in fertility drugs were big sponsors of the Bologna jamboree. </p> <p>If there is a panic rush to the clinics, as Dr de Velde believes, it is being fuelled by an awareness of the ticking clock. With every year that passes, a woman's chances of having a child get slimmer - especially past the age of 35. In the UK, fertility treatment is another postcode lottery - in some areas couples can have a cycle or two of treatment on the NHS. In others, there is nothing or an endless waiting list. The huge cost of treatment is to blame - health authorities blanche at the thought of the hole in their budget that would be created if everybody was to be funded. </p> <p>Clare Brown, president of the International Federation of Infertility Patient Associations (IFIPA) and also executive director of CHILD, the UK support organisation, is wary of telling women to wait. \"Up to 34, once you have been trying for a year or so and there is nothing, you should at least start to get the ball rolling,\" she says. \"Over 35 you should not wait longer than six months or so. You are going to be investigated first. That can take time.\" </p> <p>In her view, even if sperm counts are declining, it is just as likely that we are hearing more about infertility - and therefore assuming there is more of it - because of all the treatments that are now available. Couples with problems now come forward when they would have hidden away. \"In the past, they wouldn't have said they didn't have children because they were infertile. They would have said, 'If it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen,'\" says Brown. </p> <p> At the IFIPA stand in Bologna, she was amazed by the doctors from Indonesia, Mexico, Iran and elsewhere who arrived to talk about the need for support groups for the infertile in their own country - not because there are more of them than there have ever been, but because the treatments are becoming available for the first time. </p> <p>We have had them for 21 years now, when the UK led the world with the birth of Louise Brown. And yet now the UK has one of the worst records in Europe for enabling the childless to get help. Health authorities have diverse criteria for paying for treatment - if they do it at all. Some will bar a couple if they have previously paid for a failed attempt privately themselves - even if they spent their life savings or borrowed to the hilt to do so. \"It is totally unfair,\" says Brown. </p> <p>In the rapidly advancing world of fertility treatment, there is huge excitement, great promise and the most terrible misery for many couples. At Bologna it was clear that technology is advancing at a terrific rate. But how many of the infertile are going to be able to afford what the scientists have to offer?</p>",

Because infertility, especially in the US, is extremely commercialised, they are accepted with open arms. I think that is a development that is regrettable because a lot of couples, if they had waited - not for many years but for another year - would have quite a big chance of conceiving spontaneously without all the risks and complications of IVF,\" says de Velde. Commercially, IVF is big news. There were more than 200,000 treatment cycles of IVF and ICSI (the technique where a single sperm is injected into an egg) carried out in Europe in 1997, at a cost to the individual or the state of around \u00a33,000 a time. Organon, Serono and the other big names involved in fertility drugs were big sponsors of the Bologna jamboree. If there is a panic rush to the clinics, as Dr de Velde believes, it is being fuelled by an awareness of the ticking clock. With every year that passes, a woman's chances of having a child get slimmer - especially past the age of 35. In the UK, fertility treatment is another postcode lottery - in some areas couples can have a cycle or two of treatment on the NHS. In others, there is nothing or an endless waiting list. The huge cost of treatment is to blame - health authorities blanche at the thought of the hole in their budget that would be created if everybody was to be funded. Clare Brown, president of the International Federation of Infertility Patient Associations (IFIPA) and also executive director of CHILD, the UK support organisation, is wary of telling women to wait. \"Up to 34, once you have been trying for a year or so and there is nothing, you should at least start to get the ball rolling,\" she says. \"Over 35 you should not wait longer than six months or so. You are going to be investigated first. That can take time.\" In her view, even if sperm counts are declining, it is just as likely that we are hearing more about infertility - and therefore assuming there is more of it - because of all the treatments that are now available. Couples with problems now come forward when they would have hidden away. \"In the past, they wouldn't have said they didn't have children because they were infertile. They would have said, 'If it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen,'\" says Brown. At the IFIPA stand in Bologna, she was amazed by the doctors from Indonesia, Mexico, Iran and elsewhere who arrived to talk about the need for support groups for the infertile in their own country - not because there are more of them than there have ever been, but because the treatments are becoming available for the first time. We have had them for 21 years now, when the UK led the world with the birth of Louise Brown. And yet now the UK has one of the worst records in Europe for enabling the childless to get help. Health authorities have diverse criteria for paying for treatment - if they do it at all. Some will bar a couple if they have previously paid for a failed attempt privately themselves - even if they spent their life savings or borrowed to the hilt to do so. \"It is totally unfair,\" says Brown. In the rapidly advancing world of fertility treatment, there is huge excitement, great promise and the most terrible misery for many couples. At Bologna it was clear that technology is advancing at a terrific rate. But how many of the infertile are going to be able to afford what the scientists have to offer?",

Two of my three young ones suffer acutely from what researchers in space and aeronautical medicine call \"sense spatial disorientation\" - travel sickness, in other words. On a recent six-hour car journey to Cornwall we managed to get through seven changes of clothing, and by the time we arrived they were sitting in the back naked. At least the four-year-old can now ask for a bag when he feels the urge to regurgitate the contents of his tummy, but the toddler explodes without warning, torrents of projectile vomit splattering the back of the driver's seat. </p> <p>There was one moment of sheer panic when I had to share a bag between them as they simultaneously heaved. So far the baby is immune, but I suspect it is only a matter of time. </p> <p>Summer holidays are made of such moments. Whether it be boat, car, train or plane, travelling is frequently a stomach churner, especially when it comes to the children. Apparently up to 90% of us suffer from travel sickness at some stage, a harmless but deeply unpleasant condition that does no favours for your car's upholstery. According to recent research by the Gallup Organisation, boats are the worst: 70% of the people interviewed had felt queasy on a boat, 60% in a car and 57% in a bus or coach. </p> <p>Researchers believe that our sense of balance is to blame. It is maintained by a complex interaction within the nervous system, which involves four different processes: the inner ear which monitors the directions of motion; the eyes which tell you where you are in space and the directions of your motions; skin pressure receptors which tell you which bits of your body are touching the ground or a seat; and muscles and joint sensory receptors which tell which bits of your body are moving. The central nervous system endeavours to make sense of all this information. </p> <p>The symptoms of travel sickness appear when the central nervous system receives conflicting information from its messengers. Basically, your body is being thrown around but your eyes do not detect the motion. </p> <p>John Golding, a psychologist at the University of Westminster, who researches motion sickness for the Medical Research Council, says that animals get it too. In fact it occurs right down the evolutionary chain to frogs; even fish can get seasick if their aquarium is transported around. \"It's likely to have some sort of evolutionary survival purpose,\" he says. </p> <p>One theory is that feeling disorientated by motion sets off a type of toxin detector designed to protect us from consuming poisons. The sensations of feeling off balance and dizzy are similar to those we might experience when we've consumed something toxic (too much alcohol for example). \"It's the exact calibration of the imbalance you feel when poisoned,\" says Golding. </p> <p>Children are more susceptible than adults, especially between the ages of 8 to 13. Younger children are less likely to get it because their sense of balance has not yet stabilised. \"After that the system of calibration probably gets tuned up, but there are individual differences,\" says Golding. Women are slightly more prone to it than men, and get extra queasy when pregnant or menstruating. </p> <p>Oddly, you are unlikely to feel nauseous riding a horse, but take the sick bag if it's a camel. Our urge to throw up is affected by the vibrational frequency of the mode of transport. Fast, short jerky motions which have a high frequency are less distressing than long, swaying motions which move at a lower frequency. Going round bends and roundabouts lowers the frequency, which is why a long a winding road is almost sure to get the children going. </p> <p>The good news is that we learn to adapt long-term to motion, which is why children tend to grow out of it eventually. We also adapt short term, getting our sea legs, as the sailors would say. In fact we can adapt so well that some people who have been at sea for an extended period feel sick when they are back on land.</p> <p><strong>How to beat travel sickness</strong></p> <p><strong>Prevention</strong><br> Always travel so your eyes will see the same motion that your body and inner ears feel.

Needlessly, as it happened. </p> <p>Four mailsacks groaning with Jiffy bags were plumply hogging the floor. It was truly moving to be entrusted with so much artistic endeavour, the fruits of so much creative toil. </p> <p>\"It takes me 20 minutes to write one bar,\" revealed Elizabeth Levine, one of the three winners, whose piece, Four Vicious Violins, lasts for 76 bars. </p> <p>It was soon apparent that you had flooded us with a good deal of impressive music. Judging was going to be hard. And indeed there was some impassioned discussion in that final meeting when the three of us - the composers Gary Carpenter and Andrew Kurowski, and I - met to thrash out the verdicts. </p> <p>We couldn't just pick three winners. We decided we had to commend a further five. And beyond those were others who were truly impressive and hard to release ungonged. The works submitted to the Guardian/BBC Proms young composers' competition present a reassuring glimpse of the future of music. </p> <p>\"The fact that we ended up with more than three outstanding pieces from the 12 to 16 age range is very encouraging,\" said Carpenter. \"We had entrants, and not just the prize-winners, whose work would be taken seriously by any of the major conservatories.\" </p> <p>\"I had no idea the entries would be quite as characterful and impressive as they were,\" said Kurowski. \"Some did more predictable things, others really let their imaginations drive them on. Making the decision was difficult because there were so many avenues one could follow, so many reactions one could discover.\" </p> <p>So, what marks out the winners? Invention, certainly. </p> <p>\"The refusal to sit back on the laurels of convention,\" said Carpenter, citing Elizabeth's piece for continuing at every stage to explore and be inventive, and not to surrender to trite solutions. \"It takes no prisoners.\" </p> <p>Also, technical facility that is at least as advanced as you could expect from youngsters of the winners' ages. Homage to Leo, a sonatina for violin and piano by 12-year-old Lucius Tracy Kelly, displays admirable technique. It won for its \"quality of invention and technical acumen\". </p> <p>Composing, like any art, is about taking decisions and not plumping for the easy option. There were many pieces with tasty beginnings - a grabby opening theme, arresting rhythm or beguiling harmony, or any combination - which then ran out of puff. The quality of decisions taken at this crucial junction marked out the potential winners from the rest. </p> <p>The judges noted that many of you plumped for repetition at this point and kept it up to the end. You were very fond of your recurring basses. </p> <p>Now there is nothing wrong with this device, which is almost as old as music. It's a great survivor, the ground bass, and fundamental to a number of contemporary musical varieties. But so familiar is it, and so stuffed is music with passacaglia masterpieces, that to win a competition with it requires something special. </p> <p>We think we heard that in Merlin, by the third winner, Ollie Haydon-Mulligan, who is 14. (Incidentally, there is no gradation of winner: they are all joint first.) </p> <p>Merlin, for guitar - played by Ollie - and bass and sampled drums is a piece of funky jazz underpinned by a variety of hypnotic recurrent patterns. </p> <p>\"He didn't settle for a conventional drum-bass line, he used the medium,\" says Carpenter. \"He was concerned with decent compositional values. It's a subtle combination of computer and performance.\" </p> <p>Ollie, who started playing in a band when still at primary school and now attends Haverstock comprehensive school in north London, revealed that Merlin began \"as a mistake\". </p> <p>\"I was working on another song and this bass line started happening. It was weird timing and I wasn't sure what was going on. I kept working at it and it sort of developed.\" </p> <p>A great many of you used computers, some simply to stand in for instruments and players not available to you. Some used them as a composing tool, which is fine, but compositional values still needed to be observed. </p> <p>Many of you, quite understandably, used the computer to produce handsome scores, which again had pitfalls. Some scores proved inaccurate - not a factor in the decisions but the judges felt it needed comment, particularly for those of you with professional ambitions. </p> <p>Elizabeth, who is a pupil at the Purcell School, one of the four specialist music schools in England, is very clear about what she wants to do: \"I'd like to be a famous violinist.\" </p> <p>Although composing runs in her family - her dad, Alex, is a composer - it comes second to performance for her, and she was surprised to win. </p> <p>Four Vicious Violins is an unusual title and instrumental combination. \"The violin is a sweet instrument. I wanted to explore another side of it.\" </p> <p>Lucius says he has been \"writing properly\" for three years, and is considering composing as a career. Homage to Leo is a memorial to a pet cat who died. Its three dance movements, waltz, ballet and pavane, portray Leo. \"He was a very playful, bright and active cat,\" Lucius says. </p> <p>The winning entries can be enjoyed on Radio 3, which is broadcasting a programme about the competition during the interval of the Prom on Tuesday July 18. The concert starts at 7pm and the interval broadcast at 7.35pm. </p> <p>Elizabeth and Lucius turn out to share the same teacher, Alison Cox, head of composition at the Purcell School. Lucius, who attends Colet Court School in Barnes, west London, goes to Alison's home for lessons. </p> <p>She deserves credit for the high standards of the dozen or so entries from Purcell pupils and it is fascinating to hear her discussing teaching methods. Well aware of the heavy burden on class music teachers and loath to criticise, she feels nevertheless that more training in composition-teaching is needed. \"We are the only country in the world where every school child does composing, but sadly there is a shortage of teachers who really know how to teach it.\" </p> <p>There is also a serious dearth of opportunity for young composers in the 12-16 age group to compete with one another. \"The Guardian/BBC Proms competition responds to that need wonderfully.\"</p> <p><strong>The winners - which you can hear by clicking on the titles, providing you have Real Audio installed on your browser (free from the <a href=\"http://www.real.com/player/index.html?src=\" 000629realhome\"\">Real Audio website):</a></strong></p> <p> <strong> Ollie Haydon-Mulligan</strong>, 14, of Haverstock School, London NW1: <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0703merlin.ra\">Merlin</a> <br><strong> Lucius Tracy Kelly</strong>, 12, of Colet Court School, London SW13: <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0703homagetoleo2.ra\">Homage to Leo</a> <br><strong> Elizabeth Levine</strong>, 14, of The Purcell School, Bushey, Herts: <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/07034vv.ra\">Four Vicious Violins</a></p> <p><strong> Commended by the judges</strong></p> <p><strong>Alex Campkin</strong>, 15, of Westminster School, London SW1: MRI Brain Scan<br><strong> Melissa Daly</strong>, 15, of The Purcell School: On The Subject of Anthropods<br><strong> Jason Noghari</strong>, 15, of The Purcell School: Wind Quintet <br><strong> Ryan Penfold</strong>, 14, of The Purcell School: Trio for clarinet, bassoon and piano <br><strong> Paul Wilson</strong>, 15, of St Peter's School, York: Interlude for viola and piano</p>",

Composing, like any art, is about taking decisions and not plumping for the easy option. There were many pieces with tasty beginnings - a grabby opening theme, arresting rhythm or beguiling harmony, or any combination - which then ran out of puff. The quality of decisions taken at this crucial junction marked out the potential winners from the rest. The judges noted that many of you plumped for repetition at this point and kept it up to the end. You were very fond of your recurring basses. Now there is nothing wrong with this device, which is almost as old as music. It's a great survivor, the ground bass, and fundamental to a number of contemporary musical varieties. But so familiar is it, and so stuffed is music with passacaglia masterpieces, that to win a competition with it requires something special. We think we heard that in Merlin, by the third winner, Ollie Haydon-Mulligan, who is 14. (Incidentally, there is no gradation of winner: they are all joint first.) Merlin, for guitar - played by Ollie - and bass and sampled drums is a piece of funky jazz underpinned by a variety of hypnotic recurrent patterns. \"He didn't settle for a conventional drum-bass line, he used the medium,\" says Carpenter. \"He was concerned with decent compositional values. It's a subtle combination of computer and performance.\" Ollie, who started playing in a band when still at primary school and now attends Haverstock comprehensive school in north London, revealed that Merlin began \"as a mistake\". \"I was working on another song and this bass line started happening. It was weird timing and I wasn't sure what was going on. I kept working at it and it sort of developed.\" A great many of you used computers, some simply to stand in for instruments and players not available to you. Some used them as a composing tool, which is fine, but compositional values still needed to be observed. Many of you, quite understandably, used the computer to produce handsome scores, which again had pitfalls. Some scores proved inaccurate - not a factor in the decisions but the judges felt it needed comment, particularly for those of you with professional ambitions. Elizabeth, who is a pupil at the Purcell School, one of the four specialist music schools in England, is very clear about what she wants to do: \"I'd like to be a famous violinist.\" Although composing runs in her family - her dad, Alex, is a composer - it comes second to performance for her, and she was surprised to win. Four Vicious Violins is an unusual title and instrumental combination. \"The violin is a sweet instrument. I wanted to explore another side of it.\" Lucius says he has been \"writing properly\" for three years, and is considering composing as a career. Homage to Leo is a memorial to a pet cat who died. Its three dance movements, waltz, ballet and pavane, portray Leo. \"He was a very playful, bright and active cat,\" Lucius says. The winning entries can be enjoyed on Radio 3, which is broadcasting a programme about the competition during the interval of the Prom on Tuesday July 18. The concert starts at 7pm and the interval broadcast at 7.35pm. Elizabeth and Lucius turn out to share the same teacher, Alison Cox, head of composition at the Purcell School. Lucius, who attends Colet Court School in Barnes, west London, goes to Alison's home for lessons. She deserves credit for the high standards of the dozen or so entries from Purcell pupils and it is fascinating to hear her discussing teaching methods. Well aware of the heavy burden on class music teachers and loath to criticise, she feels nevertheless that more training in composition-teaching is needed. \"We are the only country in the world where every school child does composing, but sadly there is a shortage of teachers who really know how to teach it.\" There is also a serious dearth of opportunity for young composers in the 12-16 age group to compete with one another. \"The Guardian/BBC Proms competition responds to that need wonderfully.\" The winners - which you can hear by clicking on the titles, providing you have Real Audio installed on your browser (free from the Real Audio website): Ollie Haydon-Mulligan, 14, of Haverstock School, London NW1: Merlin Lucius Tracy Kelly, 12, of Colet Court School, London SW13: Homage to Leo Elizabeth Levine, 14, of The Purcell School, Bushey, Herts: Four Vicious Violins Commended by the judges Alex Campkin, 15, of Westminster School, London SW1: MRI Brain Scan Melissa Daly, 15, of The Purcell School: On The Subject of Anthropods Jason Noghari, 15, of The Purcell School: Wind Quintet Ryan Penfold, 14, of The Purcell School: Trio for clarinet, bassoon and piano Paul Wilson, 15, of St Peter's School, York: Interlude for viola and piano",

After a meeting with the parades commission - which yesterday banned Portadown Orangemen from marching down the Nationalist Garvaghy Road next Sunday - the Ulster Unionist leader said violence would not advance any cause. Mr Trimble said: \"Whatever decisions I've taken, there is no place for violence and riot and the incidents that we have seen over the last few days.\" However, Mr Trimble, who is MP for the Portadown area, said he was \"very disappointed\" that the parades commission did not act on a proposal from Portadown unionist councillors which he said would have helped resolve the Drumcree crisis in a fair way.

A team of British scientists has demonstrated that cannabinoids, the active ingredient in cannabis, acts on the spinal cord as well as the brain.

      "body": "<p>It took place appropriately enough on Lincoln Boulevard in Los Angeles. There, outside the Cock 'n' Bull pub, in all its expat Union Jack-bedecked splendour, was the local fire brigade engaged in an angry argument with a group of English football fans. The firefighters were telling the fans that the pub was now so full of supporters wanting to watch the live Euro 2000 game that they could not enter, for to do so would create a fire hazard. To make it worse, some fans who had stepped outside for a cigarette - smoking being banned in all bars in California - found themselves excluded, too. </p> <p>There we had it. Two nations forever intertwined by their shared history staring hard at each other's caricatures: the boozy, football-loving, loser Brit and the big, self-important, bully Yank. </p> <p>That same night we were treated to two more equally cherished caricatures when The Patriot (pictured), in which Mel Gibson plays the part of a militiaman fighting for independence from Britain, opened in time for July 4 and Independence Day. There were the heroic, democratic American winners and - boo! hiss! - there were the cruel, sadistic British losers. </p> <p>A year ago, after moving to Los Angeles and flicking between television news stations to see if I was missing anything, I noted that in two weeks there was only one item of news about the UK. It was a report of a \"cheese race\" in the Cotswolds in which ruddy-faced locals ran and tumbled down a hill in pursuit of a large cheese. As I switched between the 75 channels available, it became clear that almost every news programme had bought this item. \"Those English,\" chuckled one news anchor. It was a reminder of where Britain fitted on the national radar - a distant eccentric blip somewhere in the outer atmosphere. </p> <p>The Fourth of July is as good a time as any to consider the state of the relationship between our two nations. I don't think it's giving away too much of the plot to say that The Patriot is essentially a transatlantic Braveheart. It's an important history lesson. As Debra Jo Immergut, in the Wall Street Journal, put it: \"Who knew that all the cutest guys sided with the colonies? Who knew that African-American slaves happily took up arms to defend their oppressors?\" It was, she suggested \"a film that could make an ayatollah all misty-eyed about America\". </p> <p>With other recent films from U-571 through to Saving Private Ryan, history is being polished or even rewritten about the various conflicts involving the US. In this respect, it is all a bit like Britain in the 50s when Kenneth More or John Mills were always sorting out the Nazis and departing fighter pilots told little boys to look after the womenfolk. </p> <p>One of the pleasures of living abroad is seeing ourselves as others see us. Recently in the New York Times, Bill Gale wrote a paean to old British values saying that \"the Americanisation of London is a particularly chilling thought\". A cabby had told him that Tony Blair \"wants us to show more of your American snap'n'dash\". Clearly cabbies talk differently from when I last was in London, but bus drivers don't. </p> <p>On my last visit back I decided to take the airport bus from Heathrow to King's Cross rather than plunge into the tube. A bus drove up to the airport terminal stop with King's Cross clearly visible on its destination panel. \"Does this go to King's Cross?\" I checked. \"It bloody does now,\" said the driver who pointed out that, had it not been for me, he would have been able to finish his journey at Victoria. </p> <p>It is this difference that sums up the most obvious defining gap between the psyches of the two countries. The Yes society against the Not Bloody Likely society. Each has its own charm. Some people want to throw up at all the \"have-a-nice-days\" and some Americans love the cheerful European rudeness. </p> <p>Odd to think that the British were once noted for their politeness and the Americans for their brashness. Now the reverse is true: it is the Americans who practice the courtesies around service while the Britons win a reputation for rudeness. (And meanness, alas. Asking around Los Angeles among people who know Britons here, the most common complaint is that they are tight-fisted.) </p> <p>Raymond Chandler, who had been educated at Dulwich College and worked in Hollywood and could thus claim to have lived in the cockpits of both societies, wrote to a colleague at the start of the second world war (before it was won by the Americans on screen) that \"the English civilian population are the least hysterical in the world. They can take an awful lot of pounding and still keep planting lobelias.\" </p> <p>It is not the planting of lobelias that attracts the American press now. When Britons are not quaintly rolling cheeses down hills they are being hooligans - or weirdos. </p> <p>Reporting on Stonehenge last year, the New York Times headlined its story: \"The stiff upper lip quivers in the teeth of an eclipse.\" Wrote Alan Cowell: \"While Americans cheerfully embrace the fruits of scientific advance as the harbingers of future wealth and well-being - from bug-free soya to internet stocks - it could be argued that some people in this much older nation [Britain] with its great imperial history look backward for their coordinates.\" </p> <p>David Hackett Fischer in Albion's Seed saw four waves of Britons arriving in America: the Puritans in New England from 1629 to 1640; royalists and servants arriving in Virginia from 1642 to 1675; the Midlanders and Welsh to Delaware around 1675; and the Celts from Scotland and Northern Ireland to Appalachia in the mid-18th century. </p> <p>Now the waves have started again. The British embassy in Washington estimates there are around 2m Britons in the US. The British consulate in LA reckons there are as many as 500,000 people with British connections in southern California doing jobs across the spectrum. There are Brits in the entertainment business and now a sizeable number working - some illegally - in construction where, as one carpenter informed me, you can work all year round because of the weather as long as you don't mind getting up at 7am on a Saturday so you can watch Premiership games live in the pub. </p> <p> When Brits hit California they can have conflicting emotions. The English novelist Christopher Isherwood writes in his diaries in 1940 of an attack of self-pity when at a dude ranch in Yucca Loma. He told his friend: \"I hate all Americans. I don't belong here. I shall have to go back to Europe.\" But he revised his views: \"Actually, in my sane moments I love this country. I love it just because I don't belong here, because I'm not involved in its traditions, not born under the curse of its history. I feel free here. I'm on my own. My life will be what I make of it.\" Scotsman Robert Louis Stevenson, writing 60 years earlier than that, spoke of the American as \"the coming man\" and in a poem tells him: \"You speak another tongue than mine/Though both were English born./I towards the night of time decline/You mount into the morn.\" </p> <p>Poor, dear, old Britain seems to be the current view from here, declining fast into the night, breathlessly recounting her little Oscar triumphs and still imagining that a British accent makes a person more interesting. \"These colonials are our brethren,\" Lord Cornwallis (Tom Wilkinson) remarks in The Patriot, as he contemplates the latest atrocity carried out on the Americans by the evil Colonel Tavington (Jason Isaacs). But how much do we each still feel we are each other's brethren? </p> <p>Looking back at the old Manchester Guardian it is clear that we have battled this problem for years. In 1956, DW Brogan was telling readers about the \"Elvis the Pelvis phenomenon\" and recounting how \"the American people have, like us, a great many serious things to think about right now but one of the less serious, if not totally unimportant things, they debate is the Elvis phenomenon... in a muddled and often angry frame of mind. And it [the American public] has, on the whole, rejoiced when it has learned that teenagers in Manchester have wrecked a cinema under the inspiring influence of Rock Around the Clock.\" </p> <p>But back to the big screen. The Patriot opens at a time that Robert Altman is having a retrospective of his films, including Nashville, which was made around the bicentennial celebrations of the revolution. It included that wonderful, satirical and specially written song We Must Be Doing Something Right To Last 200 Years which summed up America's mock-modest national self-importance. Talking about the film at a public gathering in LA, Altman said that when John Lennon was killed a few years later, \"I got a call from the Washington Post asking if I felt responsible, because there was an assassination of a celebrity in my film. I said 'That's what the film's about. Do you feel responsible for not heeding my warning?'\" Which goes to show that one of the two main British criticisms of Americans - that they have no sense of irony - should have been disposed of years ago. </p> <p>The other criticism - that they can't make tea - is, sadly, true. But that, as those of us who learned about American history at school will know, is how this whole damn thing started.</p>",

With other recent films from U-571 through to Saving Private Ryan, history is being polished or even rewritten about the various conflicts involving the US. In this respect, it is all a bit like Britain in the 50s when Kenneth More or John Mills were always sorting out the Nazis and departing fighter pilots told little boys to look after the womenfolk. One of the pleasures of living abroad is seeing ourselves as others see us. Recently in the New York Times, Bill Gale wrote a paean to old British values saying that \"the Americanisation of London is a particularly chilling thought\". A cabby had told him that Tony Blair \"wants us to show more of your American snap'n'dash\". Clearly cabbies talk differently from when I last was in London, but bus drivers don't. On my last visit back I decided to take the airport bus from Heathrow to King's Cross rather than plunge into the tube. A bus drove up to the airport terminal stop with King's Cross clearly visible on its destination panel. \"Does this go to King's Cross?\" I checked. \"It bloody does now,\" said the driver who pointed out that, had it not been for me, he would have been able to finish his journey at Victoria. It is this difference that sums up the most obvious defining gap between the psyches of the two countries. The Yes society against the Not Bloody Likely society. Each has its own charm. Some people want to throw up at all the \"have-a-nice-days\" and some Americans love the cheerful European rudeness. Odd to think that the British were once noted for their politeness and the Americans for their brashness. Now the reverse is true: it is the Americans who practice the courtesies around service while the Britons win a reputation for rudeness. (And meanness, alas. Asking around Los Angeles among people who know Britons here, the most common complaint is that they are tight-fisted.) Raymond Chandler, who had been educated at Dulwich College and worked in Hollywood and could thus claim to have lived in the cockpits of both societies, wrote to a colleague at the start of the second world war (before it was won by the Americans on screen) that \"the English civilian population are the least hysterical in the world. They can take an awful lot of pounding and still keep planting lobelias.\" It is not the planting of lobelias that attracts the American press now. When Britons are not quaintly rolling cheeses down hills they are being hooligans - or weirdos. Reporting on Stonehenge last year, the New York Times headlined its story: \"The stiff upper lip quivers in the teeth of an eclipse.\" Wrote Alan Cowell: \"While Americans cheerfully embrace the fruits of scientific advance as the harbingers of future wealth and well-being - from bug-free soya to internet stocks - it could be argued that some people in this much older nation [Britain] with its great imperial history look backward for their coordinates.\" David Hackett Fischer in Albion's Seed saw four waves of Britons arriving in America: the Puritans in New England from 1629 to 1640; royalists and servants arriving in Virginia from 1642 to 1675; the Midlanders and Welsh to Delaware around 1675; and the Celts from Scotland and Northern Ireland to Appalachia in the mid-18th century. Now the waves have started again. The British embassy in Washington estimates there are around 2m Britons in the US. The British consulate in LA reckons there are as many as 500,000 people with British connections in southern California doing jobs across the spectrum. There are Brits in the entertainment business and now a sizeable number working - some illegally - in construction where, as one carpenter informed me, you can work all year round because of the weather as long as you don't mind getting up at 7am on a Saturday so you can watch Premiership games live in the pub. When Brits hit California they can have conflicting emotions. The English novelist Christopher Isherwood writes in his diaries in 1940 of an attack of self-pity when at a dude ranch in Yucca Loma. He told his friend: \"I hate all Americans. I don't belong here. I shall have to go back to Europe.\" But he revised his views: \"Actually, in my sane moments I love this country. I love it just because I don't belong here, because I'm not involved in its traditions, not born under the curse of its history. I feel free here. I'm on my own. My life will be what I make of it.\" Scotsman Robert Louis Stevenson, writing 60 years earlier than that, spoke of the American as \"the coming man\" and in a poem tells him: \"You speak another tongue than mine/Though both were English born./I towards the night of time decline/You mount into the morn.\" Poor, dear, old Britain seems to be the current view from here, declining fast into the night, breathlessly recounting her little Oscar triumphs and still imagining that a British accent makes a person more interesting. \"These colonials are our brethren,\" Lord Cornwallis (Tom Wilkinson) remarks in The Patriot, as he contemplates the latest atrocity carried out on the Americans by the evil Colonel Tavington (Jason Isaacs). But how much do we each still feel we are each other's brethren? Looking back at the old Manchester Guardian it is clear that we have battled this problem for years. In 1956, DW Brogan was telling readers about the \"Elvis the Pelvis phenomenon\" and recounting how \"the American people have, like us, a great many serious things to think about right now but one of the less serious, if not totally unimportant things, they debate is the Elvis phenomenon... in a muddled and often angry frame of mind. And it [the American public] has, on the whole, rejoiced when it has learned that teenagers in Manchester have wrecked a cinema under the inspiring influence of Rock Around the Clock.\" But back to the big screen. The Patriot opens at a time that Robert Altman is having a retrospective of his films, including Nashville, which was made around the bicentennial celebrations of the revolution. It included that wonderful, satirical and specially written song We Must Be Doing Something Right To Last 200 Years which summed up America's mock-modest national self-importance. Talking about the film at a public gathering in LA, Altman said that when John Lennon was killed a few years later, \"I got a call from the Washington Post asking if I felt responsible, because there was an assassination of a celebrity in my film. I said 'That's what the film's about. Do you feel responsible for not heeding my warning?'\" Which goes to show that one of the two main British criticisms of Americans - that they have no sense of irony - should have been disposed of years ago. The other criticism - that they can't make tea - is, sadly, true. But that, as those of us who learned about American history at school will know, is how this whole damn thing started.",

The Dollar-Kraay argument also depends on the quality of the data. As Watkins notes, the quality of the statistics from most developing countries is dreadful. </p> <p>Second, a closer inspection of Dollar's own data suggests that in many cases, the poor are not benefiting on a one for one basis, despite the headlines.

In other words, if the poor have a smaller slice of the pie to begin with, then even if the overall pie is growing, their slice will not expand by as much as it would in a country where the pie is divided up more equally. </p> <p>To take a simple example, in Brazil the poorest fifth of the population account for just 2.5% of national income, whereas in Indonesia the same group accounts for 9%. Even if the incomes of all groups are growing at the same rate, Brazil has to grow four times as fast as Indonesia to deliver the same rise in living standards. </p> <p>Oxfam argues that the World Bank paper represents a hankering for certainties of the golden era of free markets policies in the 80s when policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic assumed that the benefits of growth would trickle down to the poorest. The ruined inner cities of America and the sink estates of Britain are a testament to how shortsighted those policies were. But while new governments in Washington and Westminster have rediscoved redistribution, social security safety nets and the importance of health and education spending, they seem content to allow the institutions which set policies for the world's poorest countries to continue to impose the old, failed nostrums of the past. </p> <p> *Growth is Good for the Poor, David Dollar and Aart Kraay, Development Research Group, the World Bank, March 2000. </p> <p>Charlotte Denny is the Guardian's economics reporter. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:charlotte.denny@theguardian.com\"> charlotte.denny@theguardian.com </a></p>",

It fed on itself without ever seeming to consume itself. <br> Time passed. <br> The music was still there, but he couldn't be sure where it was coming from - or even, in the end, if it was real. <br> At last he felt able to lift his head. He was lying on his back, his wrists and ankles held by stainless steel rings. Each ring was attached to its own individual rail by a second, smaller ring. Each rail was firmly bolted to the floor. All four of the smaller rings had been locked into position on their rails, using metal eyes that were built into the floor at certain strategic points. The structure puzzled him. It was so intricate, so carefully designed. But why, what for? <br> His mind was slow and cloudy. Answers would not come. <br> He looked around. It was a large room, rectangular in shape. A single door stood in the far wall, just above the toe of his right shoe. There were three lights in the ceiling, each fitted with a wide metal shade; the light they gave off would be merciless, unflinching, like the light in an abattoir, he felt, or a laboratory. Everything had been painted white, even the pipes that ran from floor to ceiling on his right, even the wall to his left, which was built out of naked brick. There were no windows in the room, only one small skylight that looked as if it had been nailed shut. Floorboards stretched away in all directions - bare, unvarnished, slightly dusty. <br> He lay back, aware of the black rubber mat beneath his body. It reminded him of being in a gymnasium. It had the same smell. Hot-water bottles. Sweat. He stared up at the skylight. A white window-frame, a simple square of blue. It seemed only distantly related to the narrow strip of sky he had seen while walking down the alley. <br> The cigarettes, he thought. I never bought the cigarettes. <br> He saw the women as he had seen them then, their faces concealed under conical black hoods, their black cloaks swirling round their bodies. The fabric flapped and rippled, making him think of rays, the way they move across the ocean floor, and he could hear their voices overlapping - We saw you dance last week, we were in the second row, it was wonderful - so much so that it was hard to tell exactly who was speaking. He was used to receiving praise from strangers, of course. He had learned to be patient, gracious... Though he had the feeling that one of them had not talked at all. Instead, she had simply inclined her head, as if she was paying close attention. Or was she shy, perhaps? Even at the time, something about the encounter had struck him as being wrong - and yet he didn't think it was the enthusiasm; the enthusiasm had seemed genuine, unfeigned. He had been about to excuse himself and turn away when he felt that sharp, cold pain in his right hand. He shivered as he remembered how the needle had left the vein, how smoothly it withdrew, how stealthily, like a snake that has just released its venom... <br> A hypodermic, presumably. <br> A syringe. <br> He could still remember the sunlight falling across a steep roof at the far end of the alley, the tiles gleaming as if coated in gold leaf, but he could remember nothing after that - nothing until this white room with no windows, this imprisonment... <br> Once again he raised his head to look around. This time he noticed that the walls were studded with unusual fixtures - all kinds of brackets, hooks and bolts; they did not set his mind at rest since he could think of no innocent explanation for their presence. To his right, and slightly behind him, was a shallow alcove. Inside it stood a washing-machine and a tumble-drier, both German-made. The sight ought to have reassured him - such appliances were familiar, domestic, part of everyday life - and yet, in the context of the rubber mat and the stainless steel rings, in the context of the fixtures on the walls, they took on a threatening air, they became accomplices. <br> Fear surfaced on his skin like a sharp, hot scent. <br> He felt the sudden urge to urinate.</p> <p>He had no memory of hearing the door open, and yet it must have done, for there they were, the women, moving towards him, the hems of their black cloaks snagging on splinters in the floorboards. They stood above him, peering down, as though he lay far below them, as though he was lying at the bottom of a well. <br> \"You're ours now.\" <br> He could not tell which one of them had spoken. His gaze lifted beyond them, to the skylight. That square of blue, empty and indifferent. <br> The same woman spoke again. She was the tallest of the three. She had a slight accent, as if she had learned her English in America. <br> \"You belong to us,\" she said. \"You're ours.\" <br> His first instinct was to ask her what she meant, but he fought against it. He didn't want to give her the satisfaction of hearing his voice. Not yet, anyway. He wanted to deny her something. Perhaps it was the only thing he had that he could still withhold. Though she seemed content simply to stare at him - to run her eyes down the length of his body, and then up again... <br> A plane appeared behind her shoulder, a single speck of silver in the blue. It was strange to think of all the people up there, reading magazines, listening to music, drinking drinks. It was strange to think they didn't know that he was lying in a room below them, held by chains... He watched the plane cross the top right-hand corner of the skylight, its progress steady, smooth, impervious - <br> Then it was gone. <br> The women were murmuring to each other now, their voices lowered, intimate, distorted by their hoods. He couldn't distinguish one voice from another, nor could he make out what any of them were saying, even though they were still standing over him. <br> At last, and without warning, they withdrew. He lay still. The air had a muffled quality to it, a deadness. He wondered whether the room was sound-proofed. It seemed likely. If so, the music he had heard when he came round must have been playing in his head, his blood making one thin sound as it ran through his veins, like fifty bows drawn slowly over fifty sets of strings... <br> And now, in the same way, the woman's words floated in the air above him, haunting, constant, the meaning just out of reach: <br> You're ours now. You belong to us.</p> <p>It was hard for him to work out exactly how much time had passed. The blue in the skylight had darkened, though it was not yet night. He was just beginning to feel the first stirrings of hunger when the door swung open and a woman walked into the room, a tray balanced between her hands. She moved towards him cautiously, so as not to spill anything, setting the tray down on the rubber mat. There was cold meat, salad, cheese, fresh fruit and bottled water. In the context of the room, which was so bare and colourless, the food looked exotic, almost absurd. <br> Kneeling beside him, the woman reached for the water. For a few moments she struggled to undo the plastic top. Either she had no strength in her hands, he thought, or else she was nervous, perhaps. The air gushed out of her as the seal broke and the top finally came free. She filled a glass and held it to his mouth. He gulped the water down. She had to do everything for him, dabbing his chin with a napkin when he drank too fast and almost choked. <br> By now, his head had cleared. He felt he should start to take things in, to gather information. He watched as the woman peeled an apple, green skin curling away from moist white flesh and dangling in the air below her thumb. Her hands were raw, he noticed - red, slightly swollen knuckles, bitten fingernails. Her head remained lowered, which made it difficult to see her eyes, though he sometimes caught a glimpse of them, a momentary glitter, as she helped him to a piece of lettuce or a slice of meat. Once, the faint, ticklish smell of mothballs lifted off the sleeve of her cloak as she reached towards him, making him think that it had only recently been taken out of storage. Where had the cloaks come from? Did the women own them? <br> Was this the first time they had attempted something like this? <br> All of a sudden he saw the theatre floodlit for the evening's performance, with people crowding into the foyer, taxis drawing up outside - <br> \"What's the time?\" he asked. <br> The woman shook her head, her way of signalling that he shouldn't talk. But he wanted to. He had to. \"Look,\" he said, \"I've got a performance tonight.\" <br> She gave no sign that she had even heard him. <br> \"I'm due on stage at seven-thirty.\" Then, though he felt stupid saying it, he added, \"I'm a dancer.\" <br> She might as well have been deaf. <br> \"So I can't ask you anything?\" he said. <br> When the woman saw that he had eaten and drunk enough, she rose to her feet, picked up the tray and moved towards the door. He watched her go, his head lifting off the rubber mat, his neck muscles at full stretch. She had not spoken to him, he realised. Not even once. <br> Lying back, he wondered if he was being held to ransom. The thought of his father receiving a ransom note - his father who had always been so careful with money! - was almost enough to make him laugh out loud.</p> <p>Later on that first day, when night had fallen and the overhead lights had been switched on, all three women returned. This time they stood by the door at the far end of the room. They seemed to be conferring. <br> At last they turned and swept towards him. They gathered round him, as before. Disturbed by their approach, tiny complex galaxies of dust floated away from him, across the floor... <br> He had decided to hide anything he might be feeling, in much the same way that the women were concealing their identities. He would reveal as little of himself as possible. At the same time, there were things he needed to know. He had to try and find out who the women were, where they had taken him, and what they had in mind. <br> \"What do you want?\" he said. <br> The women glanced at each other. <br> \"Do you want money? Is that it?\" <br> \"Money?\" one of the women said. \"No, we don't want money.\" <br> This was not the woman who had spoken to him earlier. This woman's voice was lower, huskier, as if she smoked. She had almost no accent. <br> \"So what do you want?\" he said. <br> The woman reached up with one hand to ease the hood away from her neck. Though the material did not look particularly coarse, it appeared to be chafing her. Her skin must be sensitive, he thought. She had white hands, with short, tapering fingers, and her nail-varnish was a dark purple-black, the colour of dried blood or cheap wine. He was noticing hands; hands were all that he was being shown. <br> \"We already have what we want,\" the woman said. Then, turning to her two accomplices, she said, \"Don't you agree?\" <br> They nodded. <br> Yes, this was a different woman. She seemed to have more authority. Maybe she was even the leader. In any group of three, there would have to be a leader. <br> \"We have some rules...\" <br> The woman turned away and walked towards the alcove that housed the washing-machine and the tumble-drier. She moved slowly, and with a certain gravity, a sense of self-importance, like a judge. She told him that he should not, under any circumstances, try to escape. There was no point, actually. They had taken all the necessary precautions. They had thought of everything. She also warned him against any attempts at violence. She was sure, in any case, that it was not in his nature. If he behaved well, she said, he would be treated well. She paused, waiting for him to speak, perhaps, but when he chose to say nothing, she continued. There was a device close to his right hand. If he was hungry or thirsty, or if he needed to go to the bathroom, then all he had to do was press \u00ca <br> \"Actually,\" he said, \"I need it now.\" <br> \"The bathroom?\" <br> He nodded. <br> From where she was standing, the woman signalled to her two accomplices - a simple lowering of her head, a granting of permission. They turned and left the room. While they were gone, he examined the \"device.\" A square piece of metal - aluminium, by the look of it - had been screwed into the floor next to the mat. In the middle of this metal plate was a round white button. It looked like a light-switch or a door-bell. He pressed it once, but heard nothing. <br> \"Only when you need something,\" the woman warned him. Her two accomplices returned, carrying handcuffs and leg-irons. One sat by his feet, the other by his head. For the first time, he noticed how each individual rail doubled back on itself, resembling the handle of a traditional umbrella. When he looked at two of the rails together, the two that held his feet, for instance, he saw they had been laid out in such a way that they formed a kind of fractured S. <br> The woman sitting by his feet released the two smaller stainless-steel rings so they could run freely along their rails, then she brought his ankles close together and secured them with the irons. Only then did she unlock the larger stainless steel rings. Once his legs were securely shackled, the second woman performed an almost identical manoeuvre on his hands, using the cuffs to fasten them behind his back. The two women worked in unison, in silence. At no point was any part of his body free. The routine was so efficient that it had to have been worked out in advance. <br> They helped him slowly to his feet. Though he had only been lying down for a few hours, he felt an impatience in his muscles. Something fidgety. His body had been denied its afternoon's exercise. He stood between the two women, moving his arms and legs, moving his head on his neck, as if he was going to give his performance after all... <br> The chains that bound him chinked and rattled. <br> Taking one arm each, the women led him towards the door. With his hands cuffed tightly behind his back and his ankles shackled, it was hard to do more than shuffle. He had been wondering what lay beyond the room. This proved a disappointment to him. All he could see was a passageway, its walls and ceiling painted white, its carpet a hard-wearing, industrial shade of grey. There were two white doors, one to his left, the other at the far end of the passageway. There were no windows. The only sound he could hear was the steady, drowsy murmur of the fluorescent lighting overhead. The building felt as if it might have been refurbished recently, but he couldn't imagine what it would look like from the outside, let alone where in Amsterdam it might be - if indeed it was in Amsterdam. <br> The door to the bathroom was the door on the left. One of the women remained in the passageway, like a guard, while the other guided him inside. The room was no more than eight feet long and four feet wide. In front of him was a toilet with a black seat and a white cistern. A small hand-basin jutted from the wall to his right. The brand-name on both the toilet and the hand-basin was Sphinx, one of the most common makes in Holland. He smiled grimly when he saw the name and said, \"That's perfect,\" but the woman standing behind him did not react. Like the passageway, the bathroom had no windows. There was no mirror either. <br> Without a hint of shyness or hesitation, the woman pulled down his track-suit trousers and took his penis out of the jockstrap he was wearing underneath. He sat down to urinate, something he had never done before. He had the idea it might make things easier, somehow, even though it meant he had to face the woman who had escorted him into the room. She seemed the more bizarre for being shut in such a confined space with him ... In the silence before his urine came, he heard her breathing. It must be hot, he thought, wearing a hood and cloak - and, almost immediately, he imagined he could smell her sweat, bitter as the sap in a spring flower. He knew which woman she was. The raw knuckles, the chewed nails... She had served him his first meal. She was also the only one whose voice he had not heard as yet. All of a sudden a feeling of power ran through him. It seemed so out of place, so utterly unfounded, that it made him catch his breath. But it was fleeting, too. No sooner had it registered itself in him than it was gone, leaving not even a flicker of itself behind. <br> When he had finished, the woman pulled up his jockstrap and his track-suit trousers, then, reaching past him, flushed the toilet. Once again, there was no hint of awkwardness or prurience on her part, only a kind of methodical efficiency; a task needed doing, and she was doing it. Still, it felt odd to be handled in that way. It had brought back a period of his life that he had thought was lost for ever. With just a few simple actions, she had closed a gap of thirty years, returning him to his first few moments in the world.</p> <p>The two women who had taken him to the toilet wasted no time in chaining him to the floor again, then they hung the handcuffs and leg-irons from conveniently placed hooks on the wall behind him and retreated to the left side of the room. <br> The woman with the white hands and the darkly painted nails stepped forwards. She stood so close to him that he could see a small, right-angled tear in her cloak, about hip-high, as if it had caught on a nail, and there were spots of something that looked like dried mud along the hem. <br> \"Better?\" <br> He nodded. <br> She stood over him, peering down. Her shoes showed below her cloak. They were black, with rubber soles. \"Are you cold?\" <br> He shook his head. <br> \"No,\" she said, \"it is quite warm in here.\" <br> She kneeled beside him, looked right at him. Perhaps because her eyes were framed by the fabric of her hood, they seemed to glitter with an almost supernatural light. <br> \"You see, we don't want you to suffer,\" she said. \"On the contrary...\" <br> As if responding to a signal, the other women approached and kneeled. One sat at his feet while the other took hold of his sweater and eased it gently over his head. Underneath, he wore nothing except his old torn shirt. Starting at the collar, the woman began to undo the buttons. Her fingers were elegant but strong. This undressing was quite unlike the undressing he had just experienced in the bathroom, and not simply because a different woman had taken over. There was stealth in this. There was anticipation. <br> Wanting to make things difficult for her, he tried to move sideways, but with his wrists and ankles secured by the stainless steel rings, there was very little he could do. He could only watch, in fact, as, one by one, the almost transparent pearl-white buttons sprang out of their holes. <br> \"Ah yes,\" one of the women said - or, rather, breathed. <br> Their interest was in the air; it was palpable, like a vibration or a pressure. <br> He closed his eyes, darkness as a form of denial, darkness as escape, but found he could see more vividly than ever, the women's hands, what they were doing. Their fingers on the drawstring of his track-suit trousers, slowly teasing the knot undone, slowly loosening the waistband ... <br> \"You're very beautiful,\" he heard one of them say. <br> \"Such smooth skin,\" said another. <br> A third woman spoke, a murmur of corroboration. <br> He felt them begin to touch him. Sometimes their hands were tender, sometimes they were only curious, but there was no part of him, no curve or hollow, that they did not, in the end, explore. <br> He couldn't have said how long this adoration of his body lasted. <br> Once, the colour of the inside of his eyelids altered, and he opened his eyes to see that one of the women had switched the main lights off and that another was bringing tall candles into the room. The atmosphere became intimate, but also oddly medieval. That flickering, unstable light, and his clothes laid open, peeled back, like the skin of an animal that was being dissected. His nakedness - three figures, hooded, crouching over it... <br> He shut his eyes again. <br> There was a moment, too, when he felt the beginning of an erection, that gradual tightening at the base of his penis, that slow, almost luxurious rush of blood. It was as if his body was taking sides against him. Betraying him. Though his eyes were still closed, he could hear the women's voices: <br> \"Look.\" <br> \"He's ready.\" <br> \"Who's going first?\"</p>",

If he behaved well, she said, he would be treated well. She paused, waiting for him to speak, perhaps, but when he chose to say nothing, she continued. There was a device close to his right hand. If he was hungry or thirsty, or if he needed to go to the bathroom, then all he had to do was press \u00ca \"Actually,\" he said, \"I need it now.\" \"The bathroom?\" He nodded. From where she was standing, the woman signalled to her two accomplices - a simple lowering of her head, a granting of permission. They turned and left the room. While they were gone, he examined the \"device.\" A square piece of metal - aluminium, by the look of it - had been screwed into the floor next to the mat. In the middle of this metal plate was a round white button. It looked like a light-switch or a door-bell. He pressed it once, but heard nothing. \"Only when you need something,\" the woman warned him. Her two accomplices returned, carrying handcuffs and leg-irons. One sat by his feet, the other by his head. For the first time, he noticed how each individual rail doubled back on itself, resembling the handle of a traditional umbrella. When he looked at two of the rails together, the two that held his feet, for instance, he saw they had been laid out in such a way that they formed a kind of fractured S. The woman sitting by his feet released the two smaller stainless-steel rings so they could run freely along their rails, then she brought his ankles close together and secured them with the irons. Only then did she unlock the larger stainless steel rings. Once his legs were securely shackled, the second woman performed an almost identical manoeuvre on his hands, using the cuffs to fasten them behind his back. The two women worked in unison, in silence. At no point was any part of his body free. The routine was so efficient that it had to have been worked out in advance. They helped him slowly to his feet. Though he had only been lying down for a few hours, he felt an impatience in his muscles. Something fidgety. His body had been denied its afternoon's exercise. He stood between the two women, moving his arms and legs, moving his head on his neck, as if he was going to give his performance after all... The chains that bound him chinked and rattled. Taking one arm each, the women led him towards the door. With his hands cuffed tightly behind his back and his ankles shackled, it was hard to do more than shuffle. He had been wondering what lay beyond the room. This proved a disappointment to him. All he could see was a passageway, its walls and ceiling painted white, its carpet a hard-wearing, industrial shade of grey. There were two white doors, one to his left, the other at the far end of the passageway. There were no windows. The only sound he could hear was the steady, drowsy murmur of the fluorescent lighting overhead. The building felt as if it might have been refurbished recently, but he couldn't imagine what it would look like from the outside, let alone where in Amsterdam it might be - if indeed it was in Amsterdam. The door to the bathroom was the door on the left. One of the women remained in the passageway, like a guard, while the other guided him inside. The room was no more than eight feet long and four feet wide. In front of him was a toilet with a black seat and a white cistern. A small hand-basin jutted from the wall to his right. The brand-name on both the toilet and the hand-basin was Sphinx, one of the most common makes in Holland. He smiled grimly when he saw the name and said, \"That's perfect,\" but the woman standing behind him did not react. Like the passageway, the bathroom had no windows. There was no mirror either. Without a hint of shyness or hesitation, the woman pulled down his track-suit trousers and took his penis out of the jockstrap he was wearing underneath. He sat down to urinate, something he had never done before. He had the idea it might make things easier, somehow, even though it meant he had to face the woman who had escorted him into the room. She seemed the more bizarre for being shut in such a confined space with him ... In the silence before his urine came, he heard her breathing. It must be hot, he thought, wearing a hood and cloak - and, almost immediately, he imagined he could smell her sweat, bitter as the sap in a spring flower. He knew which woman she was. The raw knuckles, the chewed nails... She had served him his first meal. She was also the only one whose voice he had not heard as yet. All of a sudden a feeling of power ran through him. It seemed so out of place, so utterly unfounded, that it made him catch his breath. But it was fleeting, too. No sooner had it registered itself in him than it was gone, leaving not even a flicker of itself behind. When he had finished, the woman pulled up his jockstrap and his track-suit trousers, then, reaching past him, flushed the toilet. Once again, there was no hint of awkwardness or prurience on her part, only a kind of methodical efficiency; a task needed doing, and she was doing it. Still, it felt odd to be handled in that way. It had brought back a period of his life that he had thought was lost for ever. With just a few simple actions, she had closed a gap of thirty years, returning him to his first few moments in the world. The two women who had taken him to the toilet wasted no time in chaining him to the floor again, then they hung the handcuffs and leg-irons from conveniently placed hooks on the wall behind him and retreated to the left side of the room. The woman with the white hands and the darkly painted nails stepped forwards. She stood so close to him that he could see a small, right-angled tear in her cloak, about hip-high, as if it had caught on a nail, and there were spots of something that looked like dried mud along the hem. \"Better?\" He nodded. She stood over him, peering down. Her shoes showed below her cloak. They were black, with rubber soles. \"Are you cold?\" He shook his head. \"No,\" she said, \"it is quite warm in here.\" She kneeled beside him, looked right at him. Perhaps because her eyes were framed by the fabric of her hood, they seemed to glitter with an almost supernatural light. \"You see, we don't want you to suffer,\" she said. \"On the contrary...\" As if responding to a signal, the other women approached and kneeled. One sat at his feet while the other took hold of his sweater and eased it gently over his head. Underneath, he wore nothing except his old torn shirt. Starting at the collar, the woman began to undo the buttons. Her fingers were elegant but strong. This undressing was quite unlike the undressing he had just experienced in the bathroom, and not simply because a different woman had taken over. There was stealth in this. There was anticipation. Wanting to make things difficult for her, he tried to move sideways, but with his wrists and ankles secured by the stainless steel rings, there was very little he could do. He could only watch, in fact, as, one by one, the almost transparent pearl-white buttons sprang out of their holes. \"Ah yes,\" one of the women said - or, rather, breathed. Their interest was in the air; it was palpable, like a vibration or a pressure. He closed his eyes, darkness as a form of denial, darkness as escape, but found he could see more vividly than ever, the women's hands, what they were doing. Their fingers on the drawstring of his track-suit trousers, slowly teasing the knot undone, slowly loosening the waistband ... \"You're very beautiful,\" he heard one of them say. \"Such smooth skin,\" said another. A third woman spoke, a murmur of corroboration. He felt them begin to touch him. Sometimes their hands were tender, sometimes they were only curious, but there was no part of him, no curve or hollow, that they did not, in the end, explore. He couldn't have said how long this adoration of his body lasted. Once, the colour of the inside of his eyelids altered, and he opened his eyes to see that one of the women had switched the main lights off and that another was bringing tall candles into the room. The atmosphere became intimate, but also oddly medieval. That flickering, unstable light, and his clothes laid open, peeled back, like the skin of an animal that was being dissected. His nakedness - three figures, hooded, crouching over it... He shut his eyes again. There was a moment, too, when he felt the beginning of an erection, that gradual tightening at the base of his penis, that slow, almost luxurious rush of blood. It was as if his body was taking sides against him. Betraying him. Though his eyes were still closed, he could hear the women's voices: \"Look.\" \"He's ready.\" \"Who's going first?\"",

      "bodyText": "The government was accused in the high court yesterday of using oppressive tactics to prevent the Guardian and the Observer reporting allegations of the abuse of power by MI6. In what they described as an issue that went to the \"root of freedom of expression\", the newspapers' lawyers suggested that government agents were trying to cover up their involvement in murder - a reference to a plot to assassinate the Libyan leader, Colonel Gadafy, in 1996. The newspapers are challenging a ruling by an Old Bailey judge ordering them to hand over to the police any emails or notes they may have relating to the MI5 renegade David Shayler. In particular, they want the original of a letter Mr Shayler wrote to the Guardian in February - in which he confirmed the existence of the plot - and the notes of Martin Bright, an Observer journalist who reported that Mr Shayler had named two MI6 officers involved in the plot. \"The Guardian is absolutely bang in the middle of a public debate.

Judge Martin Stephens ruled in the Old Bailey in March that any email address or other material linked to the Guardian letter would be \"essential evidence\" in police inquiries, and evidence connected with the Observer's article was also \"highly relevant\". The newspapers argue that the judge gave no evidence to back up his ruling, which, they say, had a \"chilling effect\" on the media.

Some scientists claim excessive bureaucracy has led to a backlog in applications being considered, with it taking up to six months to get a decision, far longer than in other countries. Next month, the science minister Lord Sainsbury will hear concerns that red tape is driving researchers abroad. The granting of licences is governed by the Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act of 1986. Only proper research institutes or companies can get one and must show the project is necessary and that only by experimenting on animals will science be advanced. Ministers have announced an end to the testing of cosmetics, tobacco products, alcohol and weapons.</p> <p><b>Which animals are used?</b><br> In 1998, 85% of animals used were lab-bred rats, mice and other rodents. 10% were fish, amphibians and reptiles. 2.6% of experiments were on sheep, cows and pigs and 1.7% on smaller mammals such as rabbits and ferrets. The use of gorillas, chimpanzees and orang-utans is no longer allowed.</p> <p><b>How useful is animal experimentation?</b><br> Those involved say the next breakthroughs in countering diseases and advances in our knowledge of genetics will come from animal experiments. Critics claim such testing is not useful and that alternatives exist. Tests on cells in petri dishes should be used instead, they argue. Computer-based models of the human body on which a virtual drug can be tested could also be used in the future.</p> <p><b>What do the public think?</b><br> A recent Mori poll found just 24% favoured animal experiments with 64% against. But when pollsters rephrased the question and prefaced it by saying experiments could hasten the development of treatments for Aids, leukaemia or better medicines, 45% approved with 41% against.</p> <p><b>Where can I find out more?</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk\" target=\"_new\">Home Office</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.rds-online.org.uk/welfare/index.html\" target=\"_new\">RDS - 'understanding animal research in medicine'</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.ifaw.org/\" target=\"_new\">International Fund for Animal Welfare</a><br></p>",

Some scientists claim excessive bureaucracy has led to a backlog in applications being considered, with it taking up to six months to get a decision, far longer than in other countries. Next month, the science minister Lord Sainsbury will hear concerns that red tape is driving researchers abroad. The granting of licences is governed by the Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act of 1986. Only proper research institutes or companies can get one and must show the project is necessary and that only by experimenting on animals will science be advanced. Ministers have announced an end to the testing of cosmetics, tobacco products, alcohol and weapons. Which animals are used? In 1998, 85% of animals used were lab-bred rats, mice and other rodents. 10% were fish, amphibians and reptiles. 2.6% of experiments were on sheep, cows and pigs and 1.7% on smaller mammals such as rabbits and ferrets. The use of gorillas, chimpanzees and orang-utans is no longer allowed. How useful is animal experimentation? Those involved say the next breakthroughs in countering diseases and advances in our knowledge of genetics will come from animal experiments. Critics claim such testing is not useful and that alternatives exist. Tests on cells in petri dishes should be used instead, they argue. Computer-based models of the human body on which a virtual drug can be tested could also be used in the future. What do the public think? A recent Mori poll found just 24% favoured animal experiments with 64% against. But when pollsters rephrased the question and prefaced it by saying experiments could hasten the development of treatments for Aids, leukaemia or better medicines, 45% approved with 41% against.

Indeed, given the increasingly youthful average age of cinema-goers, it seems a fair bet that most of today's popcorn munchers were still in nappies when Fletch Lives, the second and last film to feature the perennially wise-cracking hack, was released in 1989. Furthermore, the franchise's star, Chevy Chase, has not been a bona fide big-screen draw since Ronald Reagan was in The White House. </p> <p>So, it will doubtless come as a surprise in many quarters to learn that American independent studio Miramax has secured the rights to all 11 of Gregory McDonald's Fletch books for Generation X auteur Kevin Smith. After all, last time the Clerks director worked on non-original material he was writing the script for Superman, a franchise with infinitely more box-office cachet. But, in fact, Smith has been a fan of the films for a long time. He was first attached to a Fletch sequel three years ago when it was Universal's turn to option the books, and he even had some exploratory meetings with Chase himself. Nor is he alone in his admiration. Ben Affleck, for example, is also a huge Fletch fan, not least the scene where Chase, having been irritated by the waiter-haranguing antics of a certain Mr Underhill, charges a lavish dinner to his account. </p> <p>\"I always tell people at hotels to 'put it on the Underhills' account'\", says the Armaggedon star. \"Sometimes they actually try to do it. Only rarely do they know what I'm talking about. But, when they do, I know I've met a kindred spirit.\" </p> <p>Hardcore devotees of Irwin Maurice Fletcher, however, know the films represent only the tip of the iceberg. In fact, the first Fletch book, which would win the prestigious Edgar Allan Poe Award, appeared back in 1974. Like his hero, McDonald had spent time working for a paper, The Boston Globe, and the early books crackle with black newsroom humour. In Fletch Won, for example, McDonald's hero attempts to prove his unsuitability as a copywriter by coming up with the headline \"Governor Jokes On Purpose.\" </p> <p>Subsequently sent to the obituary department by his increasingly frazzled editor, Frank Jaffe, Fletch begins one piece with the words \"Ruth Mulholland died peacefully today, having accomplished absolutely nothing.\" (\"It was a fact, Frank, I checked it.\") Fletch really wants to cover sports, an ambition he never fulfils. Instead, over the course of McDonald's books, Fletch engages in several unfortunate marriages, becomes incredibly rich and solves innumerable crimes. He also gets older in a manner that the likes of other 'tec heroes like Sam Spade or Dashiell Hammett's anony mous Continental Op were never allowed to do. In fact, by the time of 1993's Son Of Fletch, McDonald had lumbered his character with a long-lost offspring who, somewhat to his irritation, proved just as much of a smartarse. </p> <p>McDonald's books proved hugely popular and it was only a matter of time before Hollywood came calling. Although an established star with hits like Foul Play and National Lampoon's Vacation under his belt, Chevy Chase had never really found the vehicle that would allow him to show off the hip, laconic persona he had perfected on Saturday Night Live. Fletch, released in 1985, would prove to be the perfect match, with its hilarious range of disguises, aliases (Dr Rosenpenis, Arnold Babar, Ted Nugent) and a script which brilliantly inverted noir clich\u00e9s (\"The coroner had certified Stanwyck dead. Or at least extremely sleepy.\" ) A huge success, Fletch cemented Chase's position as one of Hollywood's biggest stars and made a sequel virtually inevitable. </p> <p>Unfortunately Fletch Lives proved less popular despite an even more extravagant array of alter-egos (Victor Hugo, Billie Jean King, KKK member Henry Himmler). Worse still, in the early 90s, Chase's career began to disappear down the drain following a series of high profile drug-related personal problems and several box-office bombs including Memoirs Of The Invisible Man - a misguided attempt to present Chase in a more dramatic role that its director, John Carpenter, would virtually disown. The nadir came in 1993 when his chat show was cancelled after a mere six weeks. To all intents and purposes his career, and hence the Fletch franchise, was dead. </p> <p>Of course, the most interesting aspect of this whole situation will be whether Smith decides to resurrect not just Fletch but Chase too. It is easy to imagine that Miramax - who are rumoured to have shelled out nearly a million dollars for the series rights - might insist on someone a little younger. Someone like Ben Affleck, for instance, who also happens to be a close friend of Smith's and starred in his recent religious satire Dogma. </p> <p>On the other hand Chase may be in luck. Certainly, when Smith was interviewed by film magazine Neon in 1997, he had no doubts about who should fill Irwin Maurice's filthy sneakers. </p> <p>\"Chevy Chase is Fletch\", claimed the director. \"There is a scene in Fletch Lives where this guy asks for his phone number and Chevy goes, 'Er, seven.' It's genius, and when I was at this restaurant, sitting down with the dude, the waitress was asking for his phone number on the back of a cheque and he goes, 'Three... two... that's it.'

Maybe he really was a vampire. </p> <p>And so Katz produced the screenplay for Shadow of the Vampire, a postmodern take on one of our most potent myths. Produced by vampire aficionado Nicolas Cage and directed by E Elias Merhige, known for his nightmare cult classic Begotten, the movie presents some of the most memorably stark and disturbingly beautiful images since director FW Murnau's original almost 80 years ago. </p> <p>Shreck is played by Willem Dafoe, whose career highlights include Jesus in The Last Temptation of Christ. \"Both Nosferatu and Jesus sons of God,\" says Dafoe, with an expression that is both seductive and dangerous. \"Children of God,\" he maintains, though it seems unlikely the Christian church would agree. Dafoe spent three hours in make-up each day transforming himself into Nosferatu. With his Bugs Bunny teeth, Mr Spock ears, Yul Brynner hairstyle and Fu Manchu fingernails, Nosferatu should be a figure of fun, but he remains one of the most chilling characters in cinema, a dark, emaciated figure in a world of shadows. The original film's subtitle was A Symphony of Horror. </p> <p>Dafoe has accurately re-created the creature, in a characterisation that is both physically grotesque and yet still horribly internal, prompting the audience to cringe at the thought of what might be going on in his brain. \"Dafoe astounds as Vampire,\" trumpeted Variety in Cannes, where the film premiered. </p> <p>\"The physicality was really dictated by the original performance,\" says Dafoe, \"by the limitations of the wardrobe, the make-up, the long fingernails, the corset to give me that special figure. When you're watching the movie you're probably not seeing these things, but I'm feeling them_ When one has such an extreme concrete physical transformation, the pretending is made a lot more available to you.

When I looked in the mirror my idea of myself is gone and all there was was Schreck.\" </p> <p>FW Murnau (played by John Malkovich in the new movie) was born Friedrich Wilhelm Plumpe in 1888 in Westphalia. He studied philology at Berlin and art history at Heidelberg, then worked in theatre before making his mark in the German film industry. Bram Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula was still in copyright when he made Nosferatu, so he changed the character names, but that was not the only change between page and screen. </p> <p>After the novel was published, Freud had expounded his theories on repression. The German Expression ist movement, of which Murnau was part, tended to view these repressed forces as evil and their release as cataclysmic. So he and Schreck presented the vampire not as dangerous seducer, but as vile rapist, your worst nightmare made real. </p> <p>A sense of dread is awakened in the audience even before they see Nosferatu, who is known to the world as Count Orlok. When the estate agent Hutter mentions Orlok's name in an inn near his castle, customers fall silent, horses bolt and wolves howl. The count sends a coach and servant, both of which travel in fast-motion, and finally he appears out of the darkness, a primeval vision emerging from the subconscious. He shows a curious interest when Hutter cuts his finger, but it is Hutter's beautiful wife that the count chooses as his dish of the day. </p> <p>Murnau subsequently worked in Hollywood, where he made the lyrical Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans at the end of the silent period.

As Bob Massie, Gordon Greenidge, Derek Underwood, Ian Botham, Graham Gooch, Allan Lamb and Dilip Vengsarkar began to assemble for the presentations during last Friday's lunch interval, Sir Garry Sobers was nowhere to be seen. </p> <p>Chris Rea, MCC's spokesman, explains: \"Sir Garry had said he'd come, but he's quite an elusive character and, as the day dawned, we were still very unsure whether he'd be there.\" With no sign of Sobers, Rea conducted a frantic search of the ground during the morning session; mindful of Sobers' fondness for a bet, Rea even checked out the Ladbrokes tent. But, as he puts it, \"no one at the ground knew where Sobers was\".</p> <p>So Rea gave up the search and returned, breathless, to the MCC Committee Room in the pavilion to find that Sobers had finally shown up. He duly hobbled onto the field, in his allotted position of eighth (and last) in the order, to receive his Waterford Crystal trophy - and a rapturous reception from a large lunchtime crowd. There were still two absentees: Glenn McGrath was playing for Worcestershire and Sir Donald Bradman, at 91, was far too frail to take up MCC's offer of a BA business-class ticket from Australia. </p> <p>The 10 players were chosen for their statistical achievements at Lord's - their tally of centuries and \"five-fors\", as recorded on the honours boards in the dressing rooms. New Zealand's greatest player Sir Richard Hadlee, watching part of the match in the Committee Room alongside some of those honoured, may have felt a twinge of envy: even \"five-fors\" in three of his four Lord's Tests weren't enough to propel him into such exalted company. </p> <p><strong>England's ready-made victory party</strong></p> <p>England's elated players didn't need to organise a victory celebration on Saturday night: Mark Ramprakash had already laid one on. A long-planned Caribbean Calypso Ball in aid of his benefit fund turned into a huge victory party. </p> <p>Although changing into formal gear may have been the last thing some of them felt like doing, most of England's heroes honoured their promise to turn up at the party at a hotel near Lord's - though the 7pm finish and post-match formalities meant that even the host was late for his own do. </p> <p>Notably absent were the cameras - kept out to protect the team's privacy - and the West Indian team, most of whom were expected. \"Under the circumstances,\" says Ramprakash's benefit secretary, Julia Pearce, \"it was understandable\". </p> <p>There was a huge burst of applause around the room when the team were congratulated by the master of ceremonies on their astonishing two-wicket win. For the punters paying \u00a399 a head for a reception, four-course dinner and dancing into the early hours, it was worth every penny - even when the England players slipped away relatively early to carry on their celebrations elsewhere. </p> <p><strong>Franks passes 50 before getting on to the field</strong></p> <p>Even if he doesn't make an immediate impact in the triangular one-day series, Paul Franks will be easily identifiable. The Nottinghamshire all-rounder, one of two uncapped players in England's 16-strong squad, has chosen a surprising number to wear on his back during the tournament: 79. His team-mates will wear shirts ranging from 1 (Nick Knight) through 2 (Andy Caddick) and 8 (Darren Gough) up to 21 (Vikram Solanki). Marcus Trescothick and Matthew Maynard, added to the party on Monday, plumped smartly for 23 and 25 respectively. </p> <p>Why 79? Well, most of the single-figure numbers were already taken. More important, Franks had his eye on the no 21 shirt, because that's his age, but Solanki had already bagged that. Next best thing, Franks decided, was to choose 79 - because he was born in 1979. \"The etiquette,\" says an ECB spokesman, \"is that established players get first choice, and the younger ones fit in around them. Players are very superstitious.\" </p> <p>Franks is not alone is choosing a high number. Henry Olonga, the Zimbabwe fast bowler, has plumped for 77, and his West Indian counterpart, Franklyn Rose, will be sporting the highest number allowed: 99 - only a bowler, surely, would make such a choice.</p> <p><em>Charles de Lisle is the author, with Christopher Martin-Jenkins, of An Australian Summer: The Story of the 1998/9 Ashes Series (Faber).

More important, Franks had his eye on the no 21 shirt, because that's his age, but Solanki had already bagged that. Next best thing, Franks decided, was to choose 79 - because he was born in 1979. \"The etiquette,\" says an ECB spokesman, \"is that established players get first choice, and the younger ones fit in around them. Players are very superstitious.\" Franks is not alone is choosing a high number. Henry Olonga, the Zimbabwe fast bowler, has plumped for 77, and his West Indian counterpart, Franklyn Rose, will be sporting the highest number allowed: 99 - only a bowler, surely, would make such a choice.

Five people were injured, rebels said. There were no immediate reports of deaths. Rebel spokesman Jo Nata said the military fired the first shot shortly after a news conference by rebel leader George Speight to comment on the swearing in earlier in the day of an all-Fijian temporary government. \"There is a little war,\" Nata said. \"One of our people was shot at, a dogfight ensued.

At the press conference, Speight said he did not expect the new government to rule for long.

The attackers were pulled off by other Speight supporters and the incident apparently did not spark the gunfight. Fiji Radio reported that there was an exchange of gunfire lasting between 10 minutes and 15 minutes between troops and armed rebels. Two ambulances were at the scene. Nata said five injured people had been taken away for treatment. Four of them were taken to a Suva hospital with gunshot wounds to their legs. \"There is blood all over the place,\" Fiji Radio reporter Malakai Veisamasame said. Reports suggested that after the gunfight there were negotiations between Speight supporters and the military, but more gunfire was heard later. Local residents living close to parliament began evacuating the area after the shooting. Earlier Tuesday, banking executive Laisenia Qarase was sworn in as prime minister in an appointment that provoked the anger of the hostage takers, who had demanded a role in naming any new government. In a speech after being sworn in, Qarase said he accepted the job as a \"call for national unity.\" He urged the gunmen to release the hostages immediately so Fiji could begin rebuilding its shattered economy. Qarase said his government would give priority to protecting indigenous Fijian rights, but that \"no communities will be excluded ... in our multiracial and multicultural society.\" He also revealed that he had received several anonymous threats since being chosen as prime minister, but that he did not fear for his life. Dressed in traditional Sulu skirts, 19 indigenous Fijian men swore to \"be faithful and bear true allegiance to the Republic of the Fijian Islands\" during a ceremony today at military headquarters in the capital, Suva. The ceremony could not be held in parliament, where rebels led by former insurance executive Speight have been holding the ousted government hostage for more than six weeks in what they call a battle for indigenous Fijian rights. Defying the hostage takers, the country's military leader on Monday named the temporary civilian government but said he will retain power until the captives are freed. Commodore Frank Bainimarama - who assumed power 10 days after rebels stormed parliament on May 19 and took the government hostage - appointed the interim leaders without input from the gunmen, who had demanded a role. Speight warned Monday the army may pay a high price for \"completely ignoring\" him. \"There's a very big possibility of making a lot of people really upset,\" he said. Two members of the Indian minority refused cabinet posts offered to them by the military. Bainimarama said the interim government would rule for 18 months and set guidelines for a new constitution. Qarase, the new prime minister, is known more as a manager than a politician, although he once served in Congress. He has been head of the Merchant Bank Fiji and is a former director of the Fiji Development Bank.",

They writhe with such ingenuity to refine, and refine again, the economic tests, that their resistance can only originate deeper down: at the source of the integrationist project, its very essence, its political meaning.

They have a profound political position, which they have every right to adopt - except for the gross dissembling that attaches to it. They refuse to address the consequences of Britain receding to the margins of Europe, though that is what they want. They're not prepared to admit that their case against the EU is political, or that the economic case against the euro is a weapon of convenience masking this political case, an adjunct to the bigger argument, not answerable by economic developments that might rebut it. They won't say never to the euro, for reasons of pure cynicism: they know middle England doesn't like saying never to anything. But never is what they would like. It's the only stance consistent with the secret political attitude at the heart of their position.</p> <p>That's the sceptic contribution to the British debate. It is intolerably evasive. But the government's evasions are worse. Grandly stating, as ministers have done since 1997, that constitutional objections to the euro do not hold water, and the political implications are not worth discussing, has become untenable. The DTI paper foreshadows the consequences. It tells us what we may not want to hear but ought to know. Yet the pretence that greater integration of the EU is not a political project could deliver a fatal blow to the perception, however clear it becomes, that only inside the euro does Britain have a chance of preserving industry and saving jobs.</p> <p>Integration is, of course, political, and those who favour it should be proud to say so. Ministers are among these people. Their policies, as Mr Blair keeps saying, are designed to keep Britain at the centre of the EU, a committed member now in highest standing. Yet, on the political dimensions of the EU, they're in denial. They barely admit that these exist. Mr Blair's reminders that we are a European country are clearer than those of any predecessor for 25 years, but they remain defensive, conditional, sometimes apologetic. Confronted with an invitation to admit that any future progress is going to be a step towards some modicum more of political integration, all ministers search their copious vocabulary to rephrase the question and deny the possibility.</p> <p>This is no way to prepare the country for the argument that will have to happen. For one thing, it leaves Britain mute in the debates other members are having. An important discussion begins in Germany and France about the future shape of the EU. It's limited by national interest, but is also speculative, stimulating, free. There is everything to play for here. Joschka Fischer and Jacques Chirac joust and disagree. All Mr Blair says is that he must wait until October before voicing an opinion. How dismal! But how reflective of the neurotic concerns that pass for policymaking, in a nation where the political nature of the European project has been ruled out of order, undiscussible, an offence against the gospel of the Five Conditions of the Treasury.</p> <p>Worse, such silence is a denial of what more people are beginning to understand. The sceptics say the euro is about more than economics, and, though less than honest in their conclusions, they are right. The government hides from that analysis. It is making a big mistake, as events will show and the debate ranges beyond its retention. The economics, strong though they might be, will never be enough.

Mr Gomersall, who has discussed with Mr Fraser the despondent mood of Japanese investors in Britain, fears the government has in recent weeks given the impression that British determination to join the euro is waning. Both Mr Fraser and Mr Gomersall have listed Japanese firms on the brink of cutting back in Britain. Among the Japanese companies which have already threatened to scale back their British operations are Nissan, which last week said it was considering relocating the production of its Micra model, NSK, which has cut 400 jobs at its Ferrybridge plant, and Canon, which has made 200 people redundant in Scotland.

But he admitted the exchange rate was still too high: \"There's no question that some low margin manufacturers have been under pressure. The weakness of the euro in conversion terms has surprised everybody,\" he said. Britain in Europe, the pro-euro campaign group, also pointed out that UK outward investment in net terms was still higher than inward investment. The Engineering Employers Federation (EEF) also said the government's euro policy was inappropriate and will today reveal after three successive quarters of improvement since last year, that conditions are deteriorating. The EEF accused the government of playing russian roulette with manufacturing jobs. The pressure on manufacturing was also underlined by a key business survey published yesterday showing the sector growing at its slowest rate for a year in June. The monthly poll by the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply showed output and orders almost ground to a halt last month. City economists said that, faced with poor sales abroad, manufacturers were concentrating on cutting costs to remain profitable, running down stocks of goods on storeroom shelves and, increasingly, shedding labour. Labour backbench figures, such as Mr O'Neill, are pressing the government to declare in the autumn that it will hold its economic assessment of whether Britain has converged sufficiently 12 months after the election. Mr O'Neill said the only tests that really matter are the exchange rate, inflation and interest rates. Eurosceptics said the two memos amounted to \"scaremongering\".

There was no indication of the bidders' identity, nor of their motivation for wanting to buy a \u00a3300 handbag for the price of one of Lady Thatcher's lectures.</p> <p>Cherie Booth's offering required 13 bids to reach \u00a382.

      "bodyText": "How much am I bid for an old bag? Well, that depends on whose arm it spent its formative years. On the opening day of bidding in a charity auction of handbags donated by famous owners, a black Salvatore Ferragamo handbag with which Lady Thatcher intimidated political friend and foe alike had attracted a bid of \u00a361,100. A tiger-print number of uncertain origin donated by Cherie Booth, meanwhile, had fetched just \u00a3100, while Mo Mowlam's black Jaeger clutch bag had limped to \u00a326. Bidding will remain open for a further nine days, but the combined allure of bags donated by 12 other celebrities, including Jerry Hall, perennial Wimbledon failure Annabel Croft and actor Lynda Bellingham, are unlikely to match the huge sum offered for the former prime minister's trademark accessory. The auction, the proceeds of which will go to Breast Cancer Care, opened yesterday at Handbag.com and within hours Lady Thatcher's bag had received 20 bids, boosting it from a reserve price of \u00a350 to \u00a3391. A further flurry of bids last night saw the asking price reach five figures. There was no indication of the bidders' identity, nor of their motivation for wanting to buy a \u00a3300 handbag for the price of one of Lady Thatcher's lectures. Cherie Booth's offering required 13 bids to reach \u00a382. But these were riches compared with offers for Ms Croft's \"pretty pink number\" (\u00a330) and a heart-shaped tinsel-fringed bag donated by GMTV's Lorraine Kelly (\u00a332). Lady Thatcher's bag was bought when she was at the height of her powers in the mid-80s, and was, she said, \"used for many special occa sions. I would only let it go for a good cause\". She once described her handbag as the only safe place in Downing Street, while colleagues came to see it as symbolic of her philosophy. \"She cannot see an institution without hitting it with her handbag,\" Julian Critchley, a backbench Tory critic, once said. And the term \"to handbag\" entered the political lexicon. A closer ally, Nicholas Ridley, once remarked in Mrs Thatcher's absence at a cabinet committee meeting: \"Why don't we start?

The settlement was agreed in principle more than a year ago and is intended to rectify the over-generosity of the previous 10-year deal, agreed under Margaret Thatcher's last Conservative government, which gave the Queen a 50% rise on the assumption of an annual inflation rate of 7.5% from 1991 to 2001. A much lower inflation rate than predicted resulted in a civil list overpayment of \u00a330m but, instead of requiring the Queen to pay back the funds, the Treasury agreed to freeze payments for 10 years, with any extra royal spending to be taken from the \u00a330m reserve. In return for this windfall, the Queen has accepted new responsibilities, including the cost of pension contributions for all staff working in the royal palaces. Details of the surplus must be released to MPs before October 15, when the royal trustees - who include the prime minister and the chancellor, Gordon Brown - make their 10-yearly statement on civil list spending. About 70% of the civil list funds are used to pay staff who deal with state papers, the organisation of public engagements and receptions undertaken by the Queen as well as the costs of official entertainment during state visits. Mr Blair is also expected to confirm that the Queen Mother will continue to receive \u00a3643,000 a year from the civil list and the Duke of Edinburgh \u00a3395,000 a year.

However, the people of Hawes are really too phlegmatic and decent to have to put up with politicians. And there is the unfortunate matter of the town's name which, when spoken rather than written, might cause unfortunate misunderstandings as far as MPs are concerned. There are, however, plenty of alternative sites. York has historical resonance, feasible transport links and - as long as you keep away from the centre - a fair amount of lebensraum. I would be willing to listen to representations from Ripon, Wakefield, Lancaster and Chester. The best site of all might be near Crewe, though that might make people think I'm joking, and this is deadly serious. A move would be good for the new capital and its whole region; good for London; and good for Britain. I envisage the Blairs living in a nice Georgian manor of the sort advertised in Country Life, for a fraction of the price of their comparative hovel in Downing Street.

      "bodyText": "A key government adviser last night advocated the legalisation of cannabis as part of a radical overhaul of political and cultural institutions in Britain. Lord Haskins, a Labour peer and chairman of the better regulation taskforce, said the BBC should take advertising, the Church of England should be disestablished and the country's main sporting bodies dumped. In a wide-ranging speech that surprised delegates at the Radio Academy's annual gathering in Glasgow, Lord Haskins predicted a complete break-up of the United Kingdom, leading to economic and cultural decline, if his warnings were not heeded. Lord Haskins's views - particularly on the BBC - are likely to be taken seriously, as he is regarded as an important adviser to the government in areas of regulation. The BBC's charter is due to be reviewed in 2006, and the debate over its future is under way. But it was the peer's remarks about drugs that caused most surprise. \"The state perseveres with some moral regulations which are mainly symbolic and largely ineffective in protecting the young, such as rules against under-age selling of tobacco, drink and lottery tickets, and total bans on drug selling,\" he said. \"Such regulations are, if anything, counterproductive. The excitement of breaking them becomes a stimulant.\" Such rules simply \"criminalise the market\", he said. Lord Haskins said he believed cannabis should be legalised, and that harder drugs could be made more readily available on prescription as part of medical programmes to treat addicts. The peer's stance is sharply at odds with government policy. The home secretary, Jack Straw, has taken a tough line on illegal substances, and will not countenance any relaxation of the laws governing hard drugs.

The government's only concession to campaigners has been to permit limited trials to test the drug's medical benefits.

The latest thing is m-commerce, as in mobile phone. </p> <p>The arrival of wireless internet access has led not only to a new breed of jargon but to a second wave of web portals - this time designed to exploit the mobile. Just as the land grab which occurred a number of years ago and left the likes of Yahoo!, America Online and, in this country, Freeserve on top in PC internet access, so the battle has begun anew in wireless. </p> <p>In a recent note, Merrill Lynch forecast that the European mobile portal market would be worth \u00a314bn by 2005 and \u00a363bn by 2010. </p> <p>The model is similar to existing PC-based portals which act as an entry point and guide to the web, relying on a mix of advertising and, in this case, m-commerce. The existing mobile portals tend to provide news, sports and share price information, TV listings and weather presented for the smaller screens of a mobile. </p> <p>The growing ubiquity of mobile phones has led analysts to predict that wireless will become the main means of accessing the internet within a few years. Certainly the value awarded to mobile portals was apparent when Vodafone used its alliance with Vivendi of France for the impending launch of Vizzavi as the trump card in its hostile takeover of Mannesmann. </p> <p>The potential prize has prompted a rapid fire series of entrants into the market. BT Cellnet has been an innovator and launched the mobile version of its Genie web portal in January. Malcolm Appleby, head of new applications at Genie, says the model for the company is to build the mobile web portal in parallel to the company's PC-based service launched in 1997. </p> <p>Elsewhere, ITouch, which is 70% owned by Tony O'Reilly's Independent News &amp; Media last week announced plans for a \u00a3300m stock market flotation. The Carphone Warehouse is getting in on the act to add some sparkle to its forthcoming float with its own portal Mviva which will be loaded on to handsets sold through its stores. </p> <p>Mviva is being launched with America Online which has suddenly found itself facing the same kinds of problems vexing Microsoft. Until now AOL has primarily been linked to the PC and needs to adapt to the so called Martini-approach - any time, any place, any where. Yahoo! has a 50-50 joint venture with Telecom Italia Mobile and is unlikely to stop there. </p> <p>For now, though, the independents will have a difficult time breaking into the market. In marked contrast to the development of the internet on fixed wires, the mobile phone networks are alive to the opportunity of the internet. They will be keen to extend their reach from collecting call revenues to shares of commerce and advertising. </p> <p>In the short term most users will lack the wherewithal to switch to a different portal and will use the network's own by default. The networks, however, will only have a brief time in which to establish their brands before the market is blown open. </p> <p>\"It's much less easy for users to roam away from the portal on wireless internet, so the incumbents will have a huge advantage if they get their acts together,\" said internet analyst Gerard Van Hamel Platerink at investment bank Schroders Salomon Smith Barney. \"But they realise they only have a small window. It will become easier and easier to move around as technology develops, particularly voice activation which will allow you to simply say, for instance, 'go to Yahoo.com'.\" </p> <p>It has already been established that the networks will not get away with any attempts to shield users from portals or websites other than their own. </p> <p>France Telecom recently lost a court case brought by an independent portal and was forced to publish details of a code which unlocks the handset. British Telecom has also been rebuked by regulator Oftel for making it difficult to remove Genie as a handset's home page. </p> <p>Mobile internet portals will begin to realise their potential with technologies due to arrive in the next few years. GPRS will introduce an \"always on\" function which means access to data and websites will be far faster. The real step change will be in 2002-3 when the third generation mobile phone services will introduce high bandwidth services and make the experience of surfing on a handset virtually the same as a PC. At that point it will be far easier to navigate the wider web and far more content will be reconfigured for mobile devices. </p> <p><strong>On your handset</strong></p> <p><strong> Mviva</strong></p> <p>Operator: Carphone Warehouse/AOL</p> <p>Content from Abbey National, Loot, Lastminute.com</p> <p>Subscribers to come from 800 UK outlets</p> <p><strong> Genie</strong></p> <p>Operator: BT<br> Content from Virgin Music, BBC, Excite </p> <p>900,000 subscribers</p> <p><strong> iTouch</strong></p> <p>Operator: Independent News &amp; Media<br> No content providers announced </p> <p>Will be accessed from other portals</p> <p><strong> Vizzavi</strong></p> <p> Operator: Vodafone/Vivendi</p> <p>No content providers announced </p> <p>Potential 70m subscribers</p>",

The Carphone Warehouse is getting in on the act to add some sparkle to its forthcoming float with its own portal Mviva which will be loaded on to handsets sold through its stores. Mviva is being launched with America Online which has suddenly found itself facing the same kinds of problems vexing Microsoft. Until now AOL has primarily been linked to the PC and needs to adapt to the so called Martini-approach - any time, any place, any where. Yahoo! has a 50-50 joint venture with Telecom Italia Mobile and is unlikely to stop there. For now, though, the independents will have a difficult time breaking into the market. In marked contrast to the development of the internet on fixed wires, the mobile phone networks are alive to the opportunity of the internet. They will be keen to extend their reach from collecting call revenues to shares of commerce and advertising. In the short term most users will lack the wherewithal to switch to a different portal and will use the network's own by default. The networks, however, will only have a brief time in which to establish their brands before the market is blown open. \"It's much less easy for users to roam away from the portal on wireless internet, so the incumbents will have a huge advantage if they get their acts together,\" said internet analyst Gerard Van Hamel Platerink at investment bank Schroders Salomon Smith Barney. \"But they realise they only have a small window. It will become easier and easier to move around as technology develops, particularly voice activation which will allow you to simply say, for instance, 'go to Yahoo.com'.\" It has already been established that the networks will not get away with any attempts to shield users from portals or websites other than their own. France Telecom recently lost a court case brought by an independent portal and was forced to publish details of a code which unlocks the handset. British Telecom has also been rebuked by regulator Oftel for making it difficult to remove Genie as a handset's home page. Mobile internet portals will begin to realise their potential with technologies due to arrive in the next few years. GPRS will introduce an \"always on\" function which means access to data and websites will be far faster. The real step change will be in 2002-3 when the third generation mobile phone services will introduce high bandwidth services and make the experience of surfing on a handset virtually the same as a PC. At that point it will be far easier to navigate the wider web and far more content will be reconfigured for mobile devices.

The new company is now based in London, W1. </p> <p>In fact, the latest figures published by the United Nations conference on trade and development, the global authority on the subject of foreign direct investment, show that Britain overtook the US as the biggest overseas investor for the first time since 1988 last year, with inflows of $63bn and outflows of $212bn. </p> <p>And how did little ol' Britain manage this? Well, start by looking at the strength of sterling. </p> <p><strong> With one click </strong><br> </p> <p> The future is bricks and clicks, not bricks and mortar, or so the business-school mantra goes. But yesterday's astonishing 1% cut in mortgage rates by HSBC, undercutting all the new internet or phone banks, turns that piece of wisdom on its head. </p> <p>The timing was especially cruel for Jim Spowart, the mortgage guru who took Standard Life Bank from nothing to 15% of the market last year, and yesterday unveiled the cutting-edge, home-loan products from his new \u00a3120m e-venture, Halifax's Intelligent Finance. IF has already lost the edge to HSBC, which is offering rock-bottom rates to common or garden branch customers who never go near a PC. </p> <p>Immediately the cry of \"loss leader\" is being howled by HSBC's rivals, which is odd as loss-leading is the basic strategy of all dot.com entrants into financial services. It is the strategy behind every mortgage product charged at less than the base rate. </p> <p>But even if HSBC does a Standard Life and mops up in the mortgage market this year, it cannot conceivably make money out of this move, particularly as it promises never to raise its home loan rate more than 1% above base rate. Even Nationwide, with no shareholders breathing down its back, runs on a 1.29% margin over base. </p> <p>This is terrible news for the quoted retail banks. One reason behind the slide in the Halifax and Abbey National share price over the past six months has been the dawning realisation that they are gradually replacing their \"back book\" of mortgages, sold on fat interest rate margins, with a new \"front book\" of mortgages with tiny margins or none. Banking analysts cannot see where the future profits flow is to come from. No wonder that HSBC's announcement lopped another 5% off Halifax and Abbey National's share price yesterday. </p> <p>But the market should be more discriminating. Abbey National is ahead of the curve, piloting measures such as branch franchising to cut costs, and is already making more than half its profits from treasury, wholesale and non-branch activities. Not so Halifax, a much purer mortgage market play, and one far more vulnerable to a damaging price war.</p>",

In fact, the latest figures published by the United Nations conference on trade and development, the global authority on the subject of foreign direct investment, show that Britain overtook the US as the biggest overseas investor for the first time since 1988 last year, with inflows of $63bn and outflows of $212bn. And how did little ol' Britain manage this? Well, start by looking at the strength of sterling. With one click The future is bricks and clicks, not bricks and mortar, or so the business-school mantra goes. But yesterday's astonishing 1% cut in mortgage rates by HSBC, undercutting all the new internet or phone banks, turns that piece of wisdom on its head. The timing was especially cruel for Jim Spowart, the mortgage guru who took Standard Life Bank from nothing to 15% of the market last year, and yesterday unveiled the cutting-edge, home-loan products from his new \u00a3120m e-venture, Halifax's Intelligent Finance. IF has already lost the edge to HSBC, which is offering rock-bottom rates to common or garden branch customers who never go near a PC. Immediately the cry of \"loss leader\" is being howled by HSBC's rivals, which is odd as loss-leading is the basic strategy of all dot.com entrants into financial services. It is the strategy behind every mortgage product charged at less than the base rate. But even if HSBC does a Standard Life and mops up in the mortgage market this year, it cannot conceivably make money out of this move, particularly as it promises never to raise its home loan rate more than 1% above base rate. Even Nationwide, with no shareholders breathing down its back, runs on a 1.29% margin over base. This is terrible news for the quoted retail banks. One reason behind the slide in the Halifax and Abbey National share price over the past six months has been the dawning realisation that they are gradually replacing their \"back book\" of mortgages, sold on fat interest rate margins, with a new \"front book\" of mortgages with tiny margins or none. Banking analysts cannot see where the future profits flow is to come from. No wonder that HSBC's announcement lopped another 5% off Halifax and Abbey National's share price yesterday. But the market should be more discriminating. Abbey National is ahead of the curve, piloting measures such as branch franchising to cut costs, and is already making more than half its profits from treasury, wholesale and non-branch activities. Not so Halifax, a much purer mortgage market play, and one far more vulnerable to a damaging price war.",

Bacardi, of Cuba, and France's Pernod Ricard, are battling over the \"Havana Club\" brand, under which both are marketing versions of a rum drink. Watchdog scolds banks Banks and building societies were yesterday scolded by a financial watchdog after a mystery shopping survey of 1,500 branches found that four in 10 fail to meet basic standards of information on charges and interest rates. The survey, carried out by the Banking Code Standards Board, found that 40% of bank customers are not told about debit or credit interest rates on their current accounts, and one in five are not told about overdraft charges. However, 56% of the those surveyed rated their overall experience of dealing with banks and building societies as good or excellent. Eureko heads towards float Eureko is just the basic platform of what could eventually become a major force in the European insurance market, said chief executive Joao Talone. Eureko, an alliance of eight mutually owned insurers including Friends Provident, yesterday announced a two-track road towards flotation. Two members, Achmea of Holland and Banco Comercial Portugues, outlined plans to pool their insurance assets to move in the next two years towards an initial public offering of their stock. The other six companies, to be known as the Eureko Alliance Partners, will have looser ties, but will also have the option of joining the floating Euriko at some later point. Glaxo boss gets second job Sir Richard Sykes, the chairman of Glaxo Wellcome, has confirmed that he will become rector of Imperial College in January, after the pharmaceuticals group's merger with SmithKline Beecham. Sir Richard will succeed the retiring Lord Oxburgh at the college, which specialises in science, technology and medicine.

      "bodyText": "The government is braced for a massive increase in scientific experiments on animals over the next few years as the completion of the human genome project causes applications for research licences to flood in. Official figures due out next month will show a rise in the number of animal experiments for the second year running after 20 years of decline. But senior scientists accuse ministers of refusing to cut red tape which they claim slows down the licensing of animal experiments because an increase in research would be \"politically unacceptable\". It is understood that the Home Office, which issues the licences, is seeking ways to play down the increase in applications for fear of offending animal-loving voters ahead of the election, expected next year. A pre-election statement in 1996 - the same year Labour received a \u00a31.1m donation from the animal rights group, the Political Animal Lobby - committed the party to attempting to reduce the numbers of animal experiments. Colin Blakemore, professor of neuroscience at Oxford University, said: \"As the consequences of the human genome research work through, I would not be at all surprised if there is a 10% increase year-on-year in the total number of animals applied for over the next five years.\" Frustration is growing at the licensing logjam, where an application can now take six months or more, compared with days or weeks in other countries. The science minister, Lord Sainsbury, is to meet senior medical researchers next month in response to a warning that scientists will leave Britain to work abroad because bureaucratic delays are impeding research. One high-profile academic was told by a senior figure involved in government oversight of research involving animals that a rise in the numbers of experiments would be \"politically unacceptable before an election\". Scientists - who are reluctant to speak out publicly for fear of jeopardising government research funding - say in private that bureaucracy in licensing processing is being used to limit research. Government concern is said to have prompted a request to scientific attach\u00e9s in UK embassies overseas that they unearth figures indicating that British research achieves more scientific benefit for each animal involved in experiments. The extreme sensitivity of the Labour party to public opinion on animal research was demonstrated in January when it emerged that the party's staff pensions fund had invested \u00a310,000 in shares in Huntingdon Life Sciences, Europe's largest animal research laboratory. The shareholding was swiftly sold off following protests. The government has already failed to act on promises in its 1996 document, New Labour - New Life for Animals, that it would support a royal commission on animal experimentation and would try to reduce the number of experiments. Dr Mark Matfield, executive director of the Research Defence Society which lobbies for animal experiments on behalf of academics and the pharmaceutical industry, predicted figures out next month would show numbers of animal experiments had risen from 2.66m in 1998 to around 2.7-2.75m in 1999, a year-on-year increase of 2 to 2.5%. Scientists insist they do not want British legislation regulating animal experiments - which they say is the strictest in the world - to be watered down. However, they argue that additions and alterations to the 1986 Animals (scientific procedures) Act - particularly the ethical review process introduced last year - have created a morass of red tape. Nancy Rothwell, professor of physiology at the University of Manchester, said: \"Writing a project licence application is one of the hardest things scientists do. There are continual changes in criteria: what was acceptable last year may not be acceptable now and certainly will not be in six months.\"",

      "body": "<p> The great geneticist JBS Haldane once complained that his wife was encouraged by the government and press to poison rats with phosphorus. </p> <p>He on the other hand had to get the signature of the president of the Royal Society, and another leading scientist, then apply to the home secretary \"before I can even kill a mouse in a slightly novel manner\". </p> <p>That was in 1927. More than 70 years on, bureaucracy is still an issue but according to drug companies, biochemists, researchers, neuroscientists and geneticists the need for animal experiments is as great as ever. </p> <p>The two worlds, however, are not strictly comparable. Then, in an essay entitled \"Some enemies of science\", Haldane could pillory the hypocrisy of fox-hunting peers who introduced bills to prohibit animal experiments. Now hunters are under pressure too, and public attitudes have changed profoundly. </p> <p>In the scientific community there has been debate for years. Opponents have argued that many animal experiments have produced misleading results. In the 60s, tobacco firms could claim tobacco smoke did not cause cancer, because it did not cause lung cancer in rodents. A drug company scientist pointed out that of the 19 chemicals known to cause cancer in humans, only seven caused cancer in rodents. A heart drug that was highly effective on rats turned out to increase the chance of death for a human cardiac patient. </p> <p>The technology moved on, too. Many scientists, having learned what they could from living creatures, moved on to see what drugs did to cells cultured in petri dishes, with sometimes more precise results. Epidemiology - the study of what happens to populations over decades - began to show a clearer picture of factors in cancer, heart disease and diabetes. Drug firms are already talking of computer-based experiments to come, modelling how a virtual drug will behave in a virtual human. </p> <p>But proponents counter that without animals, Louis Pasteur would not have developed his anthrax vaccine, and Joseph Lister could not have developed antiseptic treatments that have saved millions of lives. Animals in this century died necessarily in the development of heart surgery, hypertension treatments, anti-ulcer drugs and organ transplants. </p> <p>Now the battle is stepping up: the human genome project has unravelled human DNA and detected genes linked to cancer, diabetes and transplant rejection. But biologists still have to work out precisely what these genes, and their proteins, actually do. More knowledge, they argue, will mean more experiments, for a time. </p> <p>Scientists argue that most experiments are strictly controlled, and involve very little pain, and that some tests are anyway in the service of animal welfare rather than human health.

      "bodyText": "The great geneticist JBS Haldane once complained that his wife was encouraged by the government and press to poison rats with phosphorus. He on the other hand had to get the signature of the president of the Royal Society, and another leading scientist, then apply to the home secretary \"before I can even kill a mouse in a slightly novel manner\". That was in 1927. More than 70 years on, bureaucracy is still an issue but according to drug companies, biochemists, researchers, neuroscientists and geneticists the need for animal experiments is as great as ever. The two worlds, however, are not strictly comparable. Then, in an essay entitled \"Some enemies of science\", Haldane could pillory the hypocrisy of fox-hunting peers who introduced bills to prohibit animal experiments. Now hunters are under pressure too, and public attitudes have changed profoundly. In the scientific community there has been debate for years. Opponents have argued that many animal experiments have produced misleading results. In the 60s, tobacco firms could claim tobacco smoke did not cause cancer, because it did not cause lung cancer in rodents. A drug company scientist pointed out that of the 19 chemicals known to cause cancer in humans, only seven caused cancer in rodents. A heart drug that was highly effective on rats turned out to increase the chance of death for a human cardiac patient. The technology moved on, too. Many scientists, having learned what they could from living creatures, moved on to see what drugs did to cells cultured in petri dishes, with sometimes more precise results. Epidemiology - the study of what happens to populations over decades - began to show a clearer picture of factors in cancer, heart disease and diabetes. Drug firms are already talking of computer-based experiments to come, modelling how a virtual drug will behave in a virtual human. But proponents counter that without animals, Louis Pasteur would not have developed his anthrax vaccine, and Joseph Lister could not have developed antiseptic treatments that have saved millions of lives. Animals in this century died necessarily in the development of heart surgery, hypertension treatments, anti-ulcer drugs and organ transplants. Now the battle is stepping up: the human genome project has unravelled human DNA and detected genes linked to cancer, diabetes and transplant rejection. But biologists still have to work out precisely what these genes, and their proteins, actually do. More knowledge, they argue, will mean more experiments, for a time. Scientists argue that most experiments are strictly controlled, and involve very little pain, and that some tests are anyway in the service of animal welfare rather than human health. The public - though largely prepared to tolerate intensive farming for the sake of cheap meat - is uneasy about the idea of animal experiments, but also in favour of new treatments for disease. A Mori poll for New Scientist last year found that when asked: \"should scientists experiment on animals\" 24% were in favour, 64% against.

It cited the Portadown lodge's refusal to engage with residents.</p> <p>But it laid out a possible solution, which it hoped would allow the Orangemen a limited march along the contested route within three to eight months.</p> <p>David Jones, spokesman for the Portadown Orangemen, said Tony Blair had made a similar offer last year, holding out the prospect of a march in the autumn if they backed off from confrontation with the security forces after their service at Drumcree. He had failed to honour his pledge.</p> <p>Tony Holland, chairman of the commission, said the conditions which might lead to a future march included a decision to comply with the ruling for Sunday's parade and an immediate end to all protests. He also stipulated the Orangemen should become involved in the South African lawyer Brian Currin's mediation efforts and take part in any civic forum. During yesterday's press conference, Mr Holland appeared implicitly to criticise Mr Blair's involvement last year. He said: \"When you give a body legal powers, if you then have outside interference which cuts across the exercise of those powers, its not likely to be particularly helpful.\"</p> <p>Mr Jones yesterday warned that Portadown lodge was finding it difficult to control violence. He said Orangemen had warned Mr Blair of possi ble trouble if he failed to fulfil his pledges last year.</p> <p>Mr Jones said: \"Mr Blair then made no efforts at all to resolve the dispute.\"</p> <p>Rioting erupted at Drumcree late on Sunday after a rehearsal parade was halted at police lines outside the church. Seven RUC officers suffered minor injuries as they were pelted with missiles.</p> <p>Demonstrations in support of the Orangemen at Drumcree spread to Belfast and South Down.</p> <p>Denis Watson, Co Armagh grand master, said the order was checking to see if Mark Harbinson, from Stoneyford, Co Antrim, who had addressed the crowd while the Portadown lodge was at church, was an Orangeman.

      "bodyText": "Loyalist Johnny Adair, one of the most feared terrorists in Northern Ireland, last night arrived to join protesters on Drumcree hill outside Portadown, Co Armagh, bringing up to 80 members of the Ulster Freedom Fighters from the Shankill Road in Belfast with him. Adair, freed from the Maze prison under the terms of the early release scheme in the Good Friday agreement, marched his men to the police lines with a banner, but then walked away from confrontation. He insisted he was opposed to violence, but his arrival raised tension after clashes between protesters and police the previous night. The development came as Orangemen in Portadown yesterday rejected an offer from the parades commission which held out the prospect of them marching down the mainly nationalist Garvaghy Road in as little as three months, so ending the two-year-old standoff at Drumcree. As Northern Ireland faced up to more than a week of violence, the commission, as expected, banned next Sunday's annual parade. It cited the Portadown lodge's refusal to engage with residents. But it laid out a possible solution, which it hoped would allow the Orangemen a limited march along the contested route within three to eight months. David Jones, spokesman for the Portadown Orangemen, said Tony Blair had made a similar offer last year, holding out the prospect of a march in the autumn if they backed off from confrontation with the security forces after their service at Drumcree. He had failed to honour his pledge. Tony Holland, chairman of the commission, said the conditions which might lead to a future march included a decision to comply with the ruling for Sunday's parade and an immediate end to all protests. He also stipulated the Orangemen should become involved in the South African lawyer Brian Currin's mediation efforts and take part in any civic forum. During yesterday's press conference, Mr Holland appeared implicitly to criticise Mr Blair's involvement last year. He said: \"When you give a body legal powers, if you then have outside interference which cuts across the exercise of those powers, its not likely to be particularly helpful.\" Mr Jones yesterday warned that Portadown lodge was finding it difficult to control violence. He said Orangemen had warned Mr Blair of possi ble trouble if he failed to fulfil his pledges last year. Mr Jones said: \"Mr Blair then made no efforts at all to resolve the dispute.\" Rioting erupted at Drumcree late on Sunday after a rehearsal parade was halted at police lines outside the church. Seven RUC officers suffered minor injuries as they were pelted with missiles. Demonstrations in support of the Orangemen at Drumcree spread to Belfast and South Down. Denis Watson, Co Armagh grand master, said the order was checking to see if Mark Harbinson, from Stoneyford, Co Antrim, who had addressed the crowd while the Portadown lodge was at church, was an Orangeman. He was wearing an Orange sash when he spoke of Drumcree as Ulster's Alamo, and suggested: \"The war begins today.\"",

The alarm among ministers at the 36% rise in recorded robberies in London and other big cities in the past year lies behind the decision to hold the crime seminar at Downing Street yesterday but Jack Straw has made it clear that the major factor in this increase is the onset of the age of mass ownership of mobile phones, especially among schoolchildren. Ministers say that mobile phone thefts now account for one third of all robberies in some London boroughs, and many of them are committed by schoolchildren against their peers. \"Before mobile phones, children would have got bullied and had their dinner money stolen which wouldn't necessarily be reported to the police, while mobile phone thefts are being reported the whole time,\" said a Downing Street source.

On millennium eve another of Susan's daughters, Jessica, was feeling ill and her mood swings were the talk of a party at their home in Glan Gors. At one point Jessica started to cry. Then she became violent.</p> <p>Her father restrained her by sitting on her. In the pandemonium Mrs Ryan, 42, discovered she had been given some \"smack\" to \"celebrate\" 2000 by a drug addict who lived close by.</p> <p>Mrs Ryan and Emma, 18, went to the addict's house. They had words with the woman. Then they kicked and punched her. They forced her to kneel and ordered her to say \"I am scum, I am scum.\"</p> <p>When the beating was over, Mrs Ryan called the police. In March she and Emma pleaded guilty to causing actual bodily harm. Magistrates were sympathetic, saying the women had been severely provoked. They were sentenced to 80 and 60 hours' community service respectively.</p> <p>Wrexham has overcome challenges before. The town could have been damaged beyond repair by the closure of coal mines, breweries and steel works in the 1970s and 80s, but it got on with the business of survival and reinvented itself. Today it faces different challenges. One is drugs.</p> <p><b> Vulnerable to crime</b><br></p> <p>The curse of many inner cities has started to corrode this and many other provincial towns. Wrexham is vulnerable to organised crime because the police and the people are unsure how to defend themselves. The dealers who speed down the M53 from Liverpool and the M56 from Manchester know it.</p> <p>They regard Wrexham's two council estates, Caia Park and Plas Madoc, as virgin territory. They have brought with them what one local councillor calls \"a poverty of expectation, and a sense of overwhelming despair\".</p> <p>Heroin is cheaper in Wrexham than almost anywhere else in the country. Children aged seven have been caught smoking cannabis. Wrexham's coroner warned recently that one person overdoses on methadone every month. And where there are drug dealers, there are loan sharks. Both carry guns.</p> <p>It would be unfair to exaggerate the problem. Wrexham is not overrun by junkies and in recent years the police have managed to cut crime on limited resources. But drugs are a menace and they will not go away.</p> <p>\"We know it's going on, but we're not quite sure how bad it is,\" said one officer. \"At least we could see the drunks when they were fighting.\"</p> <p>Wrexham is the largest town in north Wales, with a population of 125,000. It can be dated to the 12th century and during the civil war it supported the royalists, who were defeated by the roundheads at the battle of Rowton Moor outside Chester in 1645.</p> <p>Wrexham's most famous son is George Jeffreys, who became lord chief justice in 1683. He was better known as Hanging Judge Jeffreys, or the Blood Judge, a nickname earned for the brutal way in which he conducted the trials of supporters of James Scott, Duke of Monmouth, who had plotted to overthrow James II.</p> <p>In recent years, Wrexham's claims to notoriety have rested with the local football club's occasional charges in the FA Cup, and the child abuse scandal at the Bryn Estyn children's home.</p> <p>Wrexham is surrounded by wonderful Denbighshire hills to the west and some of the smarter parts of Shropshire to the east. But the town has neither beauty nor charm.</p> <p>There is hostility to England, but more to affluent south Wales, particularly Cardiff. In some ways, this resentment is hard to fathom. When Wrexham lost its traditional industries, it turned to food manufacturers. It is now a prosperous town, with major employers like Kellogg's and Cadbury's.</p> <p>Although Wrexham has a reputation for being rough, the crime figures tell a different story. There has not been a murder in Wrexham for two years. The three attempted murders were \"domestics\" and solved easily.</p> <p>The town has 183 police officers who deal with most of the 22,000 incidents reported in the division, which covers the eastern part of north Wales. Crime seems to be falling. There were 3,700 crimes reported in April and May last year, 3,500 this year.</p> <p>Violent crime has dropped by 35% over the course of the year, the number of burglaries has fallen slightly and detection rates for crime overall have risen.</p> <p><b> CCTV success</b><br></p> <p>Some of the town's anti-crime initiatives have proved a great success. Four years ago Wrexham county borough council spent \u00a3250,000 setting up CCTV cameras around the town centre to deter vandals, thieves and drunks. The cameras had an immediate impact, so the council put up more. There are now 40 cameras watching the shopping parades, two others monitor the car parks on the Plas Madoc estate, and four could soon be mounted in Caia Park.</p> <p>Security guards at the major stores are equipped with a \"Shoplink\" radio, which keeps them in touch with officers in the CCTV control room. They tip each other off if troublemakers or thieves are on the prowl. A similar scheme links Wrexham's pubs and clubs.</p> <p>\"We've always had trouble in the town centre at turfing out time,\" said Detective Chief Inspector Chris Corcoran, 47. \"Since we've had the cameras, we've made more arrests. And because we had people caught on film, we got more convictions. The cameras cut out the need for lengthy investigations. With this system, you need one officer and the CCTV footage to get a guilty plea. They have been a tremendous success.\"</p> <p>Other issues which worry city forces hardly register in Wrexham. There have been only two reported racial incidents in the past 12 months.</p> <p>The town is 99% white and the force has struggled to recruit any officers from ethnic minorities. \"We want to recruit our officers locally, but we don't have any racial communities to recruit from,\" said Mr Corcoran. \"If we recruit from elsewhere, we could end up isolating them.\"</p> <p>A more pressing problem is the need to recruit women, and officers who can speak Welsh. There has been a revival of the language in recent years and 15% of the town is bilingual. Like many of his generation, Mr Corcoran is not, but his children are taught Welsh at school.</p> <p>The Caia estate, where he grew up, requires his closest attention. It is a sprawl of 3,000 terraced homes on the outskirts of the town. It had a reputation as one of the roughest places in Wales. One local politician, who asked not to be named, said: \"Twenty years ago, Caia was like the Wild West. Juvenile crime was out of control. I think the council would have liked to fence it off and throw food in once a week.\"</p> <p>Instead, the council supported a community project called The Venture. This began as an adventure playground for children, but has expanded over the past 22 years to offer services like a homework club and outreach work. The playground, built by children on the estate, is still the heart of the scheme.</p> <p>Thanks to The Venture, crime on Caia fell spectacularly during the 1980s and early 90s, but then the atmosphere began to change. \"There had always been some drugs on the estate - glue-sniffing and things like that,\" said Malcolm King, manager of The Venture.</p> <p><b> Liverpool dealers</b><br></p> <p>\"But we noticed harder drugs were being sold here seven or eight years ago. It seems the dealers in Liverpool were looking for new markets, and they came to Wrexham. The drugs flooded in. The heroin addicts were easy to spot _ shrivelled up and gaunt-eyed.\"</p> <p>He added: \"Drugs have eaten their way into parts of the estate and we have struggled to keep cohesion. Once we've lost a child to drugs, it is very hard to get them back. I resent that. There are good kids on the Caia. They should have a chance in life.\"</p> <p>The police are unsure how big the problem has become. There are no statistics on drug dealing. The evidence comes from anecdotes and from the number of addicts - one a month - who end up in the morgue.</p> <p>There have also been rumours that the police use of informers led to a crackdown on some dealers, while others were left to flourish. Mr Corcoran denies there has been any trade off, but confirmed one officer in the drugs squad is suspended and under investigation.</p> <p>\"The drugs problem is something we can't really tackle on our own,\" said one detective. The feeling, though, is that city police forces and agencies like the national crime squad are not particularly interested in a backwater like Wrexham. \"One imagines they have bigger fish to fry,\" said the officer.</p> <p><b>Wrexham</b><br></p> <p>Population: <b> 125,200</b></p> <p>Number of police: <b> 183 officers</b></p> <p>Reported crimes across eastern division of North Wales police last year:<b> 22,000</b></p> <p>Detection rate for division: <b> 33%</b></p>",

      "bodyText": "The prime minister is today expected to announce a deal freezing the size of the civil list for the next 10 years. Tony Blair will tell MPs in the Commons that the Treasury and Buckingham Palace have agreed to peg the civil list at \u00a37.9m a year until 2011. The announcement comes less than a week after the Cabinet Office minister, Mo Mowlam, was forced to make an embarrassing apology for suggesting that the royal family should move out of Buckingham Palace and into \"a good modern building\" in an effort to modernise the monarchy and save taxpayers' money. The settlement to be announced today was agreed in principle over a year ago and is intended to rectify the over-generosity of the last 10-year deal, agreed under Margaret Thatcher's last Conservative government, which gave the Queen a 50% rise in her civil list money. This set out the funding provided by the taxpayer for the upkeep of the royals on the assumption of an annual inflation rate of 7.5% from 1991 to 2001. But inflation figures over the decade were far lower than predicted, resulting in a civil list overpayment to the Queen of \u00a330m. The Treasury has agreed to freeze payments for the next 10 years, rather than require the Queen to hand back the overpayment, with any extra royal spending to be taken from the \u00a330m reserve. Details of the surplus must be released to MPs before October 15 when the royal trustees - who include the prime minister and the chancellor, Gordon Brown - make their 10-yearly statement on civil list spending. Ms Mowlam's remarks prompted palace officials to defend royal spending, insisting that the royal family had done its best to economise, saving \u00a35m on maintenance and travel expenses in the past year. Two reports issued by Buckingham Palace claimed that maintenance of the occupied royal palaces was cut by \u00a3800,000 to \u00a315m last year - a fall of nearly \u00a39m in the past eight years - and that an increased use of chartered helicopters had reduced the cost of travel from \u00a312.8m to \u00a38.6m. About 70% of the civil list funds are used to pay staff who deal with state papers, the organisation of public engagements and receptions undertaken by the Queen as well as the costs of royal garden parties and official entertainment during state visits. The civil list, which dates back to the 17th century, was renewed annually between 1975 and 1990, when the Queen and the government agreed to a 10-yearly review because this was, as Mrs Thatcher told MPs, \"appropriate for the dignity of the crown\".",

The surveillance target, Abdallah El-Zein, a Lebanese citizen whom Swiss authorities suspected of being a member of Hizbullah, will appear today as a witness in the trial. Mr El-Zein, married to a Swiss, has denied any links with Hizbullah. \"[Mossad] explained to me that [El-Zein] had been responsible for terrorist acts,\" Bental testified.

Her husband's share was twice hers because his family had injected more capital into the business and one farm was bought at a favourable price because her husband's father had been the tenant.</p> <p>The judge dismissed as unreasonable her desire to go on farming on her own, though she had been a farmer before her marriage in 1961 and had worked as an equal partner at Blagraves Farm, near Taunton, Somerset, while bringing up three children.</p> <p>Mr Justice Holman ruled that the farming business would no longer be viable if Mrs White's husband, Martin, 63, had to transfer land to her or sell land to raise the cash to buy out her share. In effect, the judge ordered Mrs White to transfer nearly half her share of the assets to her husband, who was already richer, while letting him keep all his assets.</p> <p>When the case went to the court of appeal in 1998, the three judges criticised Mr Justice Holman for basing his ruling on longstanding principles used in \"big money\" divorce cases. These give the wife a lump sum not based on a share of the family wealth but on her \"needs\" - enough to buy a suitable house and spend the rest of her life in reasonable comfort.</p> <p>The judges said these rules were outdated in cases where husband and wife were in an equal business partnership, and ruled that Mrs White could keep \u00a31.5m - the portion of the partnership assets which she legally owned.

      "bodyText": "A divorced wife who worked as an equal partner for 33 years helping her husband to build up a \u00a34.5m farming business took her claim for a half share of the assets to the House of Lords yesterday. Pamela White's case, the most important divorce case to go to the Lords for at least a decade, could pave the way to a better deal for divorced wives who worked alongside their husbands in family businesses. Mrs White, 64, felt \"a burning sense of injustice\", according to her QC, Paul Coleridge, when she was awarded a lump sum of only \u00a3800,000 by a high court judge, Mr Justice Holman, in 1996, although her share of the partnership assets totalled \u00a31.5m. Her husband's share was twice hers because his family had injected more capital into the business and one farm was bought at a favourable price because her husband's father had been the tenant. The judge dismissed as unreasonable her desire to go on farming on her own, though she had been a farmer before her marriage in 1961 and had worked as an equal partner at Blagraves Farm, near Taunton, Somerset, while bringing up three children. Mr Justice Holman ruled that the farming business would no longer be viable if Mrs White's husband, Martin, 63, had to transfer land to her or sell land to raise the cash to buy out her share. In effect, the judge ordered Mrs White to transfer nearly half her share of the assets to her husband, who was already richer, while letting him keep all his assets. When the case went to the court of appeal in 1998, the three judges criticised Mr Justice Holman for basing his ruling on longstanding principles used in \"big money\" divorce cases. These give the wife a lump sum not based on a share of the family wealth but on her \"needs\" - enough to buy a suitable house and spend the rest of her life in reasonable comfort. The judges said these rules were outdated in cases where husband and wife were in an equal business partnership, and ruled that Mrs White could keep \u00a31.5m - the portion of the partnership assets which she legally owned. Yesterday her lawyers asked five law lords to award her a half share of assets valued at \u00a34.5m in 1996. Her husband is asking for the appeal court award to be cut back. Julian Lipson, a family law partner in the London law firm Withers, said: \"The House of Lords will no doubt take the opportunity to say what the law is in 2000, because the law in 2000 is different from what it was in 1980, when the courts were more paternalistic.\" He said the outcome of the case could help wives with expensive houses, held in joint names of husband and wife, because they could argue in future that they were entitled to their legally owned half share as a minimum . The appeal court judges said the Whites' case need never have come to court if their advisers had concentrated on the fact that the couple were in a business partnership and divided the property according to the shares of partnership assets they actually owned. If they had done that \"they would have saved much anguish and very considerable legal costs\", said Lord Justice Thorpe. He added: \"It offends my sense of fairness that a wife who has worked equally and not nominally in partnership should exit with anything less than her legal entitlement in the absence of extraordinary features.\" The Lords' judgment is expected to be reserved tomorrow and delivered in the autumn.",

The PRI conceded victory to Vicente Fox, a former Coca-Cola executive who heads a movement dedicated to the sole task of kicking the ruling party out. With 91% of the vote counted yesterday, Mr Fox held 43%, the PRI's Francisco Labastida 36%, and the left-wing veteran Cuauhtemoc Cardenas 17%. Turnout was 74%, according to the Federal Electoral Institute, which organised what was generally considered to be the freest and fairest poll in Mexican history, which has been marred by fraud throughout the long PRI regime. Mr Fox's National Action party will also be the biggest party in congress and senate. As the results sank in, delirious Fox supporters brandishing huge foam fingers with Fox's trademark victory sign chanted \"Vicente! Vicente!\" and danced in human chains through the swelling crowds. Fifteen thousand supporters swarmed Mexico City's Angel of Independence monument early yesterday morning in a blizzard of confetti. The victory was not only unprecedented, but much more decisive than had been expected, with almost all commentators judging the race too close to call before the vote. In a country where 40m live in poverty, Mr Fox had reached out beyond the urban, educated and conservative constituency of his own party. The crowd that cheered the president-elect as he made his victory address added a note of good-tempered warning. \"Don't let us down\", they chanted over and over again. The new government is due to take office on December 1, three months after the new congress and senate begin work, but the transition away from what was essentially a one-party government began minutes after the release of an exit poll late on Sunday that made it clear the PRI had lost. In a historic national address that stunned the nation, President Ernesto Zedillo congratulated Mr Fox on his victory. \"I commit myself to ensuring a smooth and transparent handover of power,\" he said. Mr Labastida acknowledged defeat in a much terser manner before disoriented supporters who had gathered to celebrate victory at the PRI campaign headquarters. \"Our party is still alive, and it will stay alive and know how to recuperate,\" he said. The European Union welcomed the election results. \"I would like to congratulate the Mexican people for their demonstration of poll maturity and democratic will,\" Javier Solana, the EU's foreign policy representative, said. Mr Fox, though clearly jubilant, has been careful to avoid rubbing salt too deeply into the PRI's cavernous wound, calling on supporters to be generous in victory, more than aware that the current meekness of the defeated party could disappear when the extent of the defeat sinks in. He promised to form a government including representatives from all political parties.

The first working day of the six-month presidency, during which the 20 EU commissioners were invited to Paris, was dominated by attempts to reconcile growing differences between president Jacques Chirac and the prime minister, Lionel Jospin, more evident since the president's Berlin speech last week. But this did not delay preparation for a \"European social agenda\" that will be discussed at ministerial level at the weekend and for French embassies in the EU to signal a dynamic approach on innovations as diverse as an EU food authority to new initiatives against the misuse of drugs in sport. In London, the French ambassador, Daniel Bernard, summoned business leaders and opinion formers to hear his government's message - which included a clear commitment to what the French call \"reinforced cooperation\" which will allow a small group of countries to take initiatives without being blocked by a single country's veto. Mr Bernard made plain that a higher political profile for Euro-11, the 11-strong committee which runs the single currency, is a priority for France, including the possible appointment of a political \"Monsieur Euro\" to act as the single currency's political chief. In their different ways both Tony Blair and William Hague are saying they will accept such changes, provided British interests are protected. In Paris, the labour minister, Martine Aubry, daughter of Jacques Delors, said a \"social Europe\" would be the dominant theme over the next six months, a move that implicitly rejects Mr Chirac's determination to ensure constitutional matters should come first. Two other ministerial meetings will be held in France this month will cover the environment and culture. The French social initiative, which will be discussed in Paris on July 7 and 8, will try to extend French experiments Europe-wide, including the 35-hour week and the compulsory consultation of workers' representatives over business strategy. Britain has reluctantly adopted EU social chapter directives and France wants to make up for lost time since the 1997 Luxembourg summit when the new socialist administration failed to force Mr Chirac and the then German chancellor, Helmut Kohl, into sponsoring a single European policy on unemployment. In the new debate, France would demand much stronger guarantees in the face of flexible working practices favoured by Britain.

The unnamed clerical support worker, who is understood to have worked in the assembly's health division, was asked to leave the Cardiff Bay building after posting what he claims was a hoax email message on the internal computer system last week. The message used cockney rhyming slang to suggest a small quantity of the drug was for sale.

The email was placed on the bulletin board on the assembly's intranet system where members customarily use the small ads space to advertise more prosaic needs. Internal rules stress that the sale and wanted boards are strictly for personal items and that adverts of a commercial nature are not allowed. Although the precise nature of what is permissible is unclear, staff are warned that when it comes to \"profitable hobbies\" the best test might be whether the taxman would consider the income negligible.

But, having granted to Tony Blair an unusually long \"honeymoon\", many British media seem now to follow the unfair law of news for commerce: first praise your hero to the skies and then criticise him to hell!

Commodore Frank Bainimarama, who assumed power 10 days after rebels stormed parliament on May 19, appointed the interim leaders without input from the gunmen who had demanded a role. The move sidelined the rebels holding 27 members of the ousted Indian-led government at gunpoint in the name of indigenous Fijian rights. The coup leader, George Speight, warned that the army may pay a high price for \"completely ignoring\" him. \"There's a very big possibility of making a lot of people really upset.\" After Mr Speight's raid on parliament, the army gave in to most of his demands, including firing the prime minister, Mahendra Chaudhry - a hostage and the first ethnic Indian to lead Fiji. The army also threw out the 1997 multiracial constitution. Indians were first brought to Fiji more than a century ago by English colonialists seeking indentured labourers for rich sugar-cane fields. Today, they make up about 44% of Fiji's population, while indigenous Fijians account for about 51%. Mr Speight, a failed businessman, claims to be acting for indigenous Fijians angered by Mr Chaudhry's refusal to raise rents charged to Indian sugar-cane farmers on land communally owned by indigenous people. Notably absent from the new government are members of Fiji's Indian minority. \"We approached two well-qualified members of the Indian community, but they declined,\" Mr Bainimarama said. The interim government will rule for 18 months and set guidelines for a new constitution. The old one \"will not be reinstated\", he said. The new government should work for Fiji's poor indigenous majority, and for \"the protection of the rights of Indians and other communities that are an integral part of our nation\". Mr Bainimarama will remain head of state until all the hostages are released, the gunmen turn over their weapons, and public order is restored. A banking executive, Laisenia Qarase, was named prime minister.

I was fortunate to contact London Lesbian &amp; Gay Switchboard, who reassured me and put me in touch with a befriending organisation. I am now a happy gay man.</p> <p>Probably around the time Copeland was starting to become anxious about his identity, the media was full of the original section 28 debate and all the anti-gay messages that it encouraged. It is small wonder if he felt isolated and threatened and internalised all the hate that was stirred up.</p> <p>And what do we offer a teenager today? More positive messages about being lesbian or gay, for sure, but still there is no equalised age of consent and the renewed section 28 debate has provided another platform for a public expression of hatred and bigotry.</p> <p>The Social Exclusion Unit, the principal driver of government social policy, routinely ignores the needs of lesbians and gay men, in spite of appeals to take them seriously.</p> <p>I wonder if the Blairs have considered their clear opportunity to influence positively the environment in which little Leo and his generation will grow up, and the prevailing attitudes against which they will develop their own identity? Failure to act on the causes of bigotry will only see it flourish. <br><b>Martin Jones </b><br> London</p> <p>\u0095 Before we forget the trial and conviction of David Copeland, and our relief and satisfaction gives way to indifference, we should step back and consider our collective responsibility for the society that produced Copeland.</p> <p>Some years ago I was the target of vicious anti-gay violence, and experienced the whole gamut of emotions, including the desire for retribution.

      "bodyText": "Further to Yasmin Khan's comments (Letters, July 3), coverage of the trial of David Copeland failed to grasp the most important issue: how can we create a society in which young people who are concerned about their sexuality can get the help they need to become happy adults, whether heterosexual, gay, lesbian or bisexual? The year David Copeland was born, I was struggling with my own gay identity and had a nervous breakdown, largely as a result of the coverage of the Jeremy Thorpe trail and the prevailing negative stereotypes and attitudes toward gay men. I was fortunate to contact London Lesbian &amp; Gay Switchboard, who reassured me and put me in touch with a befriending organisation. I am now a happy gay man. Probably around the time Copeland was starting to become anxious about his identity, the media was full of the original section 28 debate and all the anti-gay messages that it encouraged. It is small wonder if he felt isolated and threatened and internalised all the hate that was stirred up. And what do we offer a teenager today? More positive messages about being lesbian or gay, for sure, but still there is no equalised age of consent and the renewed section 28 debate has provided another platform for a public expression of hatred and bigotry. The Social Exclusion Unit, the principal driver of government social policy, routinely ignores the needs of lesbians and gay men, in spite of appeals to take them seriously. I wonder if the Blairs have considered their clear opportunity to influence positively the environment in which little Leo and his generation will grow up, and the prevailing attitudes against which they will develop their own identity? Failure to act on the causes of bigotry will only see it flourish. Martin Jones London \u0095 Before we forget the trial and conviction of David Copeland, and our relief and satisfaction gives way to indifference, we should step back and consider our collective responsibility for the society that produced Copeland. Some years ago I was the target of vicious anti-gay violence, and experienced the whole gamut of emotions, including the desire for retribution. But neither then nor now is that sufficient. I avoided reading or listening to reports of Copeland's trial but, finally, I read Saturday's Guardian (Bomber gets six life terms, July 1) and I found myself sobbing, for the pain and humiliation of my own experience, for the victims of Copeland's bombs and their families and friends, but also for Copeland. We need to feel compassion for someone so racked by unhappiness, inadequacy, self-loathing and hatred that they are driven to such acts of barbarity. It's not enough to shrug our shoulders and blame something or someone else while we continue to buy the newspapers that spread blatant xenophobia. Neither can we continue to elect the same politicians who collude in that (or make damaging compromises on issues such as section 28) or allow public institutions to drag their feet, if at the same time we do not make our voices heard loud and clear. And that means in every arena, local, regional or national that touches our lives.

To celebrate the first time the same national team has won the world and then the European cups, even the staid newspaper Le Monde splashed the story alongside an unprecedented colour photograph. Headlines in national papers describing the players as \"the kings of Europe\" caught the mood of a country whose self-confidence has grown by leaps and bounds in its efforts to deal with social and economic shortfalls since a Socialist government was elected in 1997 - a year before the world cup. The prime minister, Lionel Jospin, whose political popularity stands at over 60% and who was in Rotterdam to congratulate the winners, seems the most likely leader to gain from national euphoria as France heads for local, parliamentary and presidential elections in the next 22 months. He described the 2-1 victory over Italy as a timely omen for the start of the country's six-month EU presidency. Having already taken credit for a drop of a million in the country's jobless to 9.8% and a leap in economic growth, the leftwing administration can also thank its footballers for putting a brake on racism. The team, which has players of Algerian, West African, Caribbean and central European origins playing alongside Gallic French, was already treated as an international example of racial harmony in 1998 after defeating Brazil. The sports minister, Marie-Georges Buffet, said yesterday that the multi-ethnic side proved that France had created a harmonious society \"that could do great things together\" - a claim that has been supported by the drop in support for the anti-immigration National Front party. \"The image of ethnic mixing is at the origin of a collective spirit that meets every test,\" the leftwing daily Lib\u00e9ration said in its leader. \"France's victory, its secret, is without doubt based on the winning combination of two styles - physical and technical.\" The rightwing Figaro agreed, adding: \"[Zinedine] Zidane and his heroic teammates are more than just footballers.

The militancy, which has led to arrests and shut down parts of the city, is being heralded as the rebirth of union activism in the US. William Daniels - Dustin Hoffman's father in the film The Graduate - is leading one of the bitterest strikes in entertainment history as head of the Screen Actors Guild which, with the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, called the strike against advertisers who want to pay actors lump sums rather than repeat fees. The mainly low-paid actors say it will leave them much worse off. Meanwhile, teachers have taken their dispute to the streets, homecare workers have brought city centre traffic to a halt and hotel workers have been gathering outside Loew's hotel in Santa Monica to win union recognition there and in other hotels in the city. The hotel workers are led by Maria Elena Durazo, president of the local Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees union (Here).

In January this year Jack Straw, the home secretary, announced that the organised crime branch of the Metropolitan police was investigating Mr Henderson's activities. This came after it was reported that Mr Henderson had celebrated New Year at his country home on Dartmoor, which is marked with a 5ft-high gallows and a sign saying \"Beware of the Dogs\".

Instead, she became the person the Queen Mother most loved to hate, was accused of being everything from a Nazi sympathiser to a man in drag, and lived out her later years as the loyal but trapped wife of a man she never intended to marry in the first place. She came from the wrong generation to write a scandal-dripping autobiography, but imagine how much the News Of The World would have paid for the rights. </p> <p> Wallis Simpson: The Demonised Duchess (C4) cast a sober eye over her life and reputation, and found an ambitious woman determined to escape from her beginnings as the barely tolerated daughter of the wealthy Warfields, of Baltimore. Like a doomed Edith Wharton heroine, rumours of illegitimacy blighted her social prospects. </p> <p>Wallis's early years read like Graham Greene. She married an American navy flier, who drank too much and abused her. She followed him to China, where she had an affair with an Italian diplomat who later became Mussolini's son-in-law. She became renowned as an enthusiastic poker player, and travelled through China possibly on some kind of undercover assignment for the US government. Later, when she married shipping heir Ernest Simpson and started her affair with Edward, Prince of Wales, British intelligence supposedly compiled the \"China Dossier\", detailing her exploits in the Orient (rumoured to include a spell in a Shanghai brothel). </p> <p>Her fatal mistake was to be too successful in the tricky sport of social climbing. She probably intended her affair with Edward to be an exciting diversion which whirled her into the aristocratic high life, but she hadn't foreseen that the pitiful prince would conceive a hopeless dependency on her. He was crowned Edward VIII in 1936, but when he planned to abdicate to be with her, she foresaw that she would bear the brunt of worldwide condemnation, and fled to France. Her worst fears came true, and the rest of her life was spent in gilded exile, first in the Bahamas during the war, then subsequently in Paris. The royal family's sole conciliatory gesture was to allow her to stay at Buckingham Palace for Edward's funeral in 1972. Wallis kept up appearances to the last, but this was a bleak and macabre tale. </p> <p>In Cyber Attack!, Panorama (BBC1) probed into the murky world of computer hackers who are lurking at the end of a modem, waiting to break into your computer, steal your most valuable files and plunder your credit card details. They might zap your PC with a malevolent virus, like the recent Love Bug. Those with darker ambitions have hacked into computers at the Pentagon, and tampered with space shuttle missions. </p> <p>This should have been scary and fascinating, but the film felt disappointingly flat. Perhaps that was because of its American bias, evident in interviews with grungy American computer-nerds and doom-prophesying American senators. Also, it could have made more of the looming threat that the more troublesome the hackers become, the more governments and corporations will retaliate with illiberal legisla tion and squads of \"cyber police\" with unlimited powers. Computers and the internet are supposed to be liberating tools, but could easily become catalysts for institutionalised repression. </p> <p>Buffalo - The African Boss (The Natural World, BBC2) explored the social organisation of the buffalo of Tanzania, and found that any threat comes not from dysfunctional geeks bearing a grudge but from hungry lions. These are the buffalo's only natural enemies, unless you include Tom Conti's narration, which found the great thespian struggling awkwardly to impart a tone of knowing irony where it really didn't belong. The dazzling photography said it all, revealing how the buffalo order their affairs via a hereditary hierarchy, take votes on which way to travel, and present a coordinated defence against lion-attacks.

Bizarrely, she still can't get on the country radio stations in her homeland though, she argues, \"it's kind of a compliment when you listen to the crap they play\". Now, armed with a Virgin Records deal, she's wondering if she can repeat her success in the rest of the world. </p> <p>With her Goth-like eye make-up, studs in her nose and lower lip and a ring through her right ear, Chambers isn't much like anyone you'd associate with country music of any era. Then again, her life bears little resemblance to anything you've ever heard before either. While other Australian kids were raised on teen soaps and the Minogue sisters, Chambers was leading a nomadic lifestyle trapping foxes on the Nullarbor Plain. \"The Nullarbor is a big desert that runs across the middle of the country,\" she explains. \"Foxes had become a big problem in Australia, so farmers would hire us to hunt them. It was back when there was a big fur trade, and we'd sell the skins. I think it's a bit strange actually, but at the time it was normal for us. We'd hunt kangaroos, too, but only for food.\" </p> <p>The Chambers family travelled around the Nullarbor by day, then by night they'd make camp and sing around the fire. It was here that Chambers's father Bill passed on his enthusiasm for country music, from Hank Williams and Jimmie Rodgers to Gram Parsons and Emmylou Harris. Since the family were Seventh Day Adventists, Bible songs and gospel music also figured prominently, and Bill taught his family so well they were able to form their own self-contained group, the Dead Ringer Band, comprising Chambers, her parents, and her brother Nash. They spent 10 years touring Australia, playing anywhere from the big cities to the outback of Queensland and the Northern Territory. </p> <p>\"I've travelled all my life and we enjoyed touring so much. You didn't have to have a nine-to-five job, so it was worth it just for that. You couldn't make a whole lot of money out of it, but who does in the music industry unless you're a superstar?\" </p> <p> W hile Chambers now steps out under her own name, it's still a family affair. Her father plays guitar throughout the album, while her brother Nash produced it. Since the Dead Ringer Band had made four albums of their own, Chambers and her folks already knew their way around the studio. Consequently, while it's still a debut solo album by a young artist, The Captain exudes a maturity and self-awareness you'd expect from somebody 10 years older, comfortably spanning bluegrass, hillbilly music and crunchy country rock. \"Some of the songs are seven years old, and one of them was written during the recording of the album, so they're coming from everywhere,\" she says. \"I kind of like the fact that it's the last 23 years of my life rolled into 42 minutes.\" </p> <p>The Chambers family saga offers plenty of scope for a tunesmith with an eye for detail. In her song Southern Kind of Life, Chambers could be describing Texas or Tennessee, but the song is about south Australia: \"My town wasn't even on the map, you could pass right through it in 20 seconds flat. Old friends and Bibles filled the house, no room for money and no money anyway.\" </p> <p>These Pines strikes a distant echo of the Louvin Brothers' In The Pines, but Chambers is singing about Norfolk Island in the Pacific, not the backwoods of Alabama. \"The Captain was this guy I had a relationship with - his nickname was Captain Eddie,\" Chambers reveals. \"He's from Norfolk Island, where we recorded the album and where the Norfolk Pine comes from. I was touring in western Australia and I was homesick for Norfolk, so I wrote about those pines.\" </p> <p>It looks like there may be a lot more touring in store, and a lot more homesickness.

      "bodyText": "A black former paratrooper with a medal for Northern Ireland service died in handcuffs on a police station floor while officers thought he was asleep or play-acting, an inquest heard yesterday. Several different versions were then given by police to relatives of Christopher Alder, who was 37, and had been celebrating in a nightclub only hours before his death, the coroner's jury in Hull was told. Closed circuit TV film of the dying man will be played to the three women and six men, along with eight barristers, including Michael Mansfield QC, representing Mr Alder's family. Five detectives, who are shown in the film discussing what to do with the dying man as he lay slumped on the floor of the custody suite, have been suspended and are awaiting trial accused of misconduct in public office by failing to take reasonable and proper care of him. The inquest heard that the former soldier, who had worked at a number of jobs to pay for a computer studies course, had earlier been half-dragged from a police van after a fight outside the Waterfront nightclub in Hull and later trouble at the city's Royal Infirmary. The East Riding of Yorkshire coroner, Geoffrey Saul, told the jury: \"There is nobody on trial here.This inquest is simply a fact-finding exercise. \"But we need to find out how a man in his late 30s, who was seemingly fit and well, went to a nightclub in Hull and a few hours later met his death.\" The inquest heard that it was only after 12 minutes that one police officer noticed that Mr Alder had apparently stopped breathing and efforts were made to save his life. Officers gave first aid but it was too late. Mr Saul said that the jury would be told that the cause of death was difficult to determine, and they would need to consider the \"full picture\" of events leading up to his death. Home Office pathologist John Clark said it was unlikely that a head injury suffered during a fight earlier was a direct cause of death. The coroner said that Mr Alder had returned to Hull from Hampshire after his marriage broke up. He had gone to the nightclub on March 31, 1998, and got into a late-night argument with a Leeds man, Jason Ramm, who was then thrown out by security staff. Mr Ramm lay in wait outside until the club closed at 2am and confronted Mr Alder, who fell over and cracked his head after apparently exchanging punches with another Afro-Caribbean man, Jason Paul, 29. The coroner said: \"Not all the witnesses agree exactly what happened, but it is suggested Mr Alder connected with blows to Jason Paul, who had been acting as a peacemaker, before Mr Paul hit him once in the face.\" Mr Alder, who was brought up in Hull by Nigerian parents, was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary, where staff described him as \"extremely troublesome\". The inquest heard that the doctor on duty did not consider the head injury serious but could not take an X-ray because Mr Alder would not co-operate. Two police officers escorted Mr Alder out and advised him to go home, but arrested him when he refused and took him to Queen's Gardens police station. The inquest is expected to last four weeks.",

Geoffrey Eade, Hoverspeed's managing director, said last night: \"The abolition of duty free has had a significant impact on cross-Channel services during the winter months. \"To continue on the old basis, operators would have to increase winter fares dramatically to recover lost duty free profits.\" He said that the trend was towards people taking their cars to mainland Europe for shopping ashore , buying more goods but travelling less frequently. Staff were told about the withdrawals last week, because they will lead to job cuts which are still being worked out by the company. Hoverspeed said that the hovercraft were extremely reliable. \"They have been kept in good trim and we don't want to send them to the knacker's yard.

It travels along a timeline of kitchens, beginning with her mother's and ending with her own.</p> <p>It talks about what she and her mother and her friends cooked and what they talked about while they were cooking. It is full of old recipes, fresh insights, odd asides and extraneous advice.

The time was the mid-1970s; the event, the Isle of Man Tourist Trophy, on the island's 37.73-mile road circuit.

Only by coming out from behind his fairing could he see anything of the country road. He did not care if he was called a coward, he told me, he would never race on the island again. And he didn't.

The UK's existing list reflects the same pattern, with only four natural sites out of 17 - the Giant's causeway in Northern Ireland, and three islands, St Kilda, and two tiny colonial outposts, Henderson island in the south Pacific and Gough island in the south Atlantic. Europe is adding former coal mines, steel works, forests, and an entire huge redundant iron works in Germany to correct the balance. Yesterday the government nominated the Dorset and east Devon coast, not just for its beauty but for the extraordinary fossil finds in its crumbling cliffs which helped shape the theory of evolution; the Derwent valley, for its pioneering 18th century textile mills which influenced the development of English factories and the entire developing 19th century industrial world; Saltaire, regarded as the finest surviving textile mill village; and New Lanark, another industrial centre expanded until it became internationally renowned as a model community. The nominations, which the culture secretary, Chris Smith, said represented \"the best of our cultural, industrial and natural heritage\", will be sent today to Unesco, which has until next January to decide whether to accept them. \u0095 Britain's world heritage sites, and the dates at which they were added, are: Durham cathedral and castle (1986); Fountains abbey, St Mary's church and Studley royal park (1986); Ironbridge gorge (1986); Stonehenge and Avebury (1986); Blenheim palace (1987); Palace of Westminster, St Margaret's church and Westminster abbey (1987); City of Bath (1987); Hadrian's wall (1987); the Tower of London (1989); Canterbury cathedral (1988); the Gwynedd castles and town walls of Edward I (1986); St Kilda (1986); Giant's causeway (1986); Henderson island (1986); Edinburgh old and new towns (1996); Gough island wildlife reserve (1996); Maritime Greenwich (1996).",

The associated board of the Royal Schools of Music suggests the government has gone some way towards halting the drop in the number of children playing instruments under the Tories, though it has not yet turned the tide. The report by the board, which represents the four royal schools, shows the class divide in instrument playing is narrowing. Among children of parents in social classes D and E - semi-skilled and unskilled manual workers, and casual employees - 39% play an instrument, up four points on 1996 figures. For children in social classes A and B - senior or middle-ranking managers and professionals - the proportion playing an instrument is down from 55% to 47% over the same period. Overall, the proportion of 5- 14-year-olds playing an instrument remained steady at 41% between 1996 and 1999, after a fall of 4% between 1993 and 1996, which the board estimates meant lost opportunities for 300,000 children. Richard Morris, chief executive of the associated board, said the 1988 Education Reform Act, which allowed schools to opt out of local authority control, splintered the system of area-wide music centres. \"It was very bad for instrumental music because obviously no individual school can employ its own french horn teacher. It needs to be organised at a level above the individual school - it doesn't work otherwise. \"That is a fundamental reason why instrumental music suffered during the early 1990s. I think the government has recognised that and has tried to do something.\" The Department for Education is ploughing \u00a3150m into schools music over three years through its centrally allocated standards fund. \"Those measures are showing some signs of having stopped the rot,\" Mr Morris said, although he warned that too often money from the fund was being used by councils as substitute, rather than additional, money. \"About \u00a340m of central funding was put into music services in 1999 but probably about \u00a325m came out again, so the net benefit is still quite modest.\" He urged the government to put in place a centrally organised, permanent system for funding music, which was not prey to the whims of local authority or national lottery funding.

The number of 11- 14-year-olds playing instruments dropped by eight points to 40% in 1996. The number of adults who can play an instrument dropped \"significantly\", from 30% to 24%, between 1996 and 1999. Ultimately orchestras had a smaller pool of players to choose from. \"I'm not saying all of them would have become Yehudi Menuhin, but all of them would benefit educationally and some might have become fine players.\" Some 37% of boys play an instrument, up 4 points from 1996, and 46% of girls, down two.",

      "bodyText": "A teenage prodigy missing from her Oxford college for 12 days had called her dean to say she was safe and \"needed space\", it emerged yesterday. Sufiah Yusof, 15, who won a place at Oxford to read maths when she was 13, disappeared shortly after sitting her exams on June 22. The teenager, who is in the third year of a four-year master's degree at St Hilda's, failed to board a train from Oxford to her family home in Coventry. Sufiah called the college dean, Laura Newby, the day after going missing, to say she was safe but offered few clues as to her whereabouts. University sources indicated Sufiah had recently become interested in politics and was known to have attended local meetings of the Socialist Workers' party. One theory is that she may have gone to London with a new friend made at a political meeting. The teenager's distraught father, Farooq Yusof, yesterday said he was unaware of any problems Sufiah had, and he expressed grave fears that his \"inexperienced and na\u00efve\" daughter might be in danger. The 43-year-old father of five, himself a mathematician, said: \"We are all desperately worried and feel so helpless.\" The 15-year-old, who was educated at home by her Malaysian-born parents, disappeared without money, credit cards or a mobile phone, behaving \"totally out of character\". Comforting his wife, Halimahton, 44, a chemist, and their four other children, Mr Yusof described Sufiah as a \"conscientious and diligent\" girl who rose at 4am each morning to pray. He said he had worked with the police to pursue many avenues of inquiry, including examining possible friendships Sufiah might have made on the internet, but all had so far proved fruitless. Elizabeth Llewellyn-Smith , principal of St Hilda's college, described the youngest student in the history of the college as a \"pretty normal teenager\" who had shown no signs of being under pressure. She defended the special care arrangements put in place for Sufiah, which had included remaining under family supervision and strict prohibition from parties and bars. Meanwhile, education experts warned that children like Sufiah attending university at a young age could suffer damaging effects if deprived of the chance to form vital bonds with their peers. Ken Bore, director of the National Association for Gifted Children, said: \"Normally we would not advise such an early entry because the young person's personal maturity is often not developed sufficiently to be able to function effectively with much older people. He added: \"I think it would make them feel isolated and also very unusual. Young people are very sensitive to peer pressure.\" Jo Counsell, education consultant for the National Association for Gifted Children, described the experience of being fast tracked at the age of 10 as \"very negative\". At 17 she dropped out of the Royal College of Music where she was studying violin because she felt she lacked confidence. \"I was bullied at school and unhappy even though I did well academically,\" she said. \"Looking back it wasn't worth it. It took an awful long time to feel confident in myself.\" Valsa Koshy, director of the Able Children's centre at Brunel university, called for further research into the effects of radically accelerated education . \"As a mother and an educationist who has been dealing with this issue for over seven years, my feeling is that without enough evidence we should not be encouraging very radical acceleration for children,\" she said.

Our love of the sand and the surf translates into a business worth about \u00a34.6bn and employing over 500,000 people. But this annual invasion is just one of many factors putting a big strain on our 15,000 kilometre coastline. Our beaches are under pressure. What can we do?

How long are you expected to stay in? There are basically two sorts of commissions: permanent and short. Permanent means staying as an officer until you're 38 or you've done 16 years of service. Short means 12 years. Tallyho! Quite. \u0095 learndirect 0800 100900 may be able to give further information and advice on courses. \u0095 For further details contact your local Armed Forces Careers Office.",

But when that publicity unleashes a torrent of racist abuse from poison pen writers and the dark side of the internet, then you have to wonder if silent anonymity, like honesty, is not the best policy.</p> <p>Following the recent, high-profile, publicity in a Sunday broadsheet about Stockport College and its alleged policy on banning certain words, it now seems opportune to put our side of the story forward in a truthful and reflective way. </p> <p>The college does not have a policy of banning words, or indeed a policy that requires students to sign a contract banning such words. The initial article in the Sunday Telegraph was wrong, and all the subsequent publicity in the media further distorted these allegations. It was not so much a matter of the blind leading the blind, as a paperchase of the Gadarene swine. Our computers even crashed with the torrent of racist abuse sent in our direction. </p> <p>The college, its staff and students, have learnt a great deal in the past few weeks. One thing is very clear, that this country has a long way to travel on equal opportunities and most certainly the issues associated with language and its use. It is a most complex topic and one, sadly, in which a number of people wish to trivialise and highlight prejudices, particularly towards people from ethnic minorities.</p> <p>Numerous hate messages were received by the college, many anonymous, which have both upset and unsettled staff.

      "bodyText": "Any publicity is good publicity, it is said. But when that publicity unleashes a torrent of racist abuse from poison pen writers and the dark side of the internet, then you have to wonder if silent anonymity, like honesty, is not the best policy. Following the recent, high-profile, publicity in a Sunday broadsheet about Stockport College and its alleged policy on banning certain words, it now seems opportune to put our side of the story forward in a truthful and reflective way. The college does not have a policy of banning words, or indeed a policy that requires students to sign a contract banning such words. The initial article in the Sunday Telegraph was wrong, and all the subsequent publicity in the media further distorted these allegations. It was not so much a matter of the blind leading the blind, as a paperchase of the Gadarene swine. Our computers even crashed with the torrent of racist abuse sent in our direction. The college, its staff and students, have learnt a great deal in the past few weeks. One thing is very clear, that this country has a long way to travel on equal opportunities and most certainly the issues associated with language and its use. It is a most complex topic and one, sadly, in which a number of people wish to trivialise and highlight prejudices, particularly towards people from ethnic minorities. Numerous hate messages were received by the college, many anonymous, which have both upset and unsettled staff. What, no doubt, seemed to the newspapers and mass media an amusing story about the absurdities of PC language, triggered an obscene and frightening backlash somewhere in the depths of the public mind. People who think there is no problem of racial intolerance in this country, particularly in the area of racism and the use of language, are deluding themselves. This incident indicates a set of worrying and latent attitudes and values towards equal opportunities. This is indeed cause for concern at a time following the Stephen Lawrence case and recent racist murders, as well as accusations of institutional racism in the police force and, indeed, some government departments.

      "body": "<p>When the idea of an annual British-style league table for Asia-Pacific universities was suggested by Asiaweek magazine, the sceptics said it would never last. The region, which has more than half the world's population, was too large and diffuse, they said - and it just isn't the Asian way for national institutions to be compared in such an explicit fashion.</p> <p>Three years on, it would seem the critics might have been right. The latest survey of the \"best\" universities in Asia, published in the June 30 issue of the Hong Kong-based magazine, is almost as notable for its missing institutions - in some cases entire countries and territories - as for its top place-getters.</p> <p>Japan's Kyoto and Tohoku Universities again took the first and second spots among the 77 \"multidisciplinary\" institutions surveyed, although in reverse order from last year. Other institutions in that leading group were in Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore.

      "bodyText": "When the idea of an annual British-style league table for Asia-Pacific universities was suggested by Asiaweek magazine, the sceptics said it would never last. The region, which has more than half the world's population, was too large and diffuse, they said - and it just isn't the Asian way for national institutions to be compared in such an explicit fashion. Three years on, it would seem the critics might have been right. The latest survey of the \"best\" universities in Asia, published in the June 30 issue of the Hong Kong-based magazine, is almost as notable for its missing institutions - in some cases entire countries and territories - as for its top place-getters. Japan's Kyoto and Tohoku Universities again took the first and second spots among the 77 \"multidisciplinary\" institutions surveyed, although in reverse order from last year. Other institutions in that leading group were in Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore. Among 39 science-and-technology institutions, which the magazine rates separately, South Korea's elite Advanced Institute of Science and Technology retained its top ranking. Faring considerably less well than in previous surveys, at least among participating institutions from the 14 countries surveyed, were national universities in Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines, where the magazine found that only about a quarter of each institution's full-time teachers and researchers have PhDs. With the exception of the University of Auckland, the country's largest, New Zealand's universities continued to rate poorly, in some cases worse than countries receiving foreign aid from the New Zealand government. As with similar surveys published by the Financial Times, US News and World Report and Macleans magazine in Canada, Asiaweek's immodest aim is to measure the academic excellence of institutions by quantifying their achievements. Or, as Cesar Bacani, the survey's editor, explained in a recent interview at his Hong Kong office, \"objectifying the myths\". \"In Asia, unfortunately, it's often been the way that a university will claim to be the best university in a country or in all of Asia, and its basis for saying that is because they say that always been the case. Nothing else! You just have to take their word for it. But we feel that could be shortchanging the consumers.\" Working with four assistants and the magazine's correspondents, Bacani now spends much of each year concentrating on the survey, along with another separate survey, published in May, of top MBA schools. Results are based on a number of familiar categories: academic reputation; selection criteria; faculty resources; research output; financial ratio of students to academic staff members; graduate students; citations in international journals; and Internet bandwidth. Once again, however, Japan's most prestigious institution of higher-learning, the venerable University of Tokyo, ranked top in the first two surveys, led the swelling group of institutions that did not return any of Bacani's telephone calls this year. Tokyo's president, Hasumi Shigehiko, has said that education and research at his institution \"cannot be compared with that of other universities...

Citing similar reservations - while remaining leery of being judged alongside \"national\" institutions in Taiwan - most top mainland Chinese institutions opted out of the latest survey.

In colleges and universities across the United States, students are protesting about the sweatshop factory conditions which they claim are commonplace in the production of American university-endorsed clothing and sportswear. </p> <p>These factories are found throughout the debt-laden Third World in countries such as Guatemala, Nicaragua and Bangladesh. With over 220 college and university student groups now members of the newly formed umbrella organisation which is coordinating the national campaign, United Students Against Sweatshops, the sweatshop issue is now recognised as the single biggest and fastest growing campaign within American universities. This year alone university and college students have led 16 separate sits-ins of university buildings. </p> <p>There is nothing in the UK university system comparable to the American practice of clothing and sports manufacturers providing lucrative sponsorship deals to universities and colleges, something which American campaigners cite as one of the main reasons for the campaign's success. </p> <p>\"Students have a more direct relation to sweatshop issues than they do to many other social justice and environmental issues,\" explains Andrew Cornell, a recent graduate from the University of Michigan and student sweatshop activist. \"By buying clothing and shoes from companies that use sweatshops, students are supporting those companies. People are often more willing to get involved in a campaign that they are tied to personally.\" </p> <p>Molly McGrath from the University of Wisconsin sweatshop campaign believes that it is the simplicity of the campaign that has lead to its popularity. </p> <p>\"A lot of the students involved in the campaign are generally like me, white kids who've never been involved in political or social justice activity before, but who recognise that our clothes shouldn't be made by people who are treated like slaves - it's an easy thing to understand.\" </p> <p>Despite being dominated by a number of big name corporate players such as Nike and Reebok, the students make it clear that they are not interested in calling for a boycott of any one company. </p> <p>\"This is an industry-wide problem and is not specific to a handful of companies, which is why this campaign doesn't call for a boycott,\" explains Suzanne Webb from the University of Kentucky sweatshop campaign. \"A boycott would only hurt the very people that we are working with.\" </p> <p>Instead, the sweatshop campaign is now focusing on two key demands: that universities withdraw their membership of the industry-backed Fair Labor Association and instead sign up with the Workers Rights Consortium, a body made up of students, university officials and labour and human rights campaigners. </p> <p>The reluctance of universities to agree to the these demands has led to a number of student occupations of university administration buildings such as the sit-in at the University of Kentucky this April which ended with police arresting students amid protests of heavy-handed tactics on the part of the university and police. </p> <p>\"Towards the end of the sit-in, people were getting shoved to the ground and grabbed by the neck by the police,\" says Amy Shelton, who was involved in the protest. \"The police tried to herd the crowd of protesters over the top of people that had already fallen down. One student was hospitalised for a neck injury when she was assaulted by a police officer.\" </p> <p>The response from industry has been similarly dramatic. This spring, Nike, the market-leader of the sportswear industry, announced that it was to cancel millions of dollars' worth of sponsorship from three US universities. The decision followed the announcement from the Universities of Oregon, Michigan and Brown University that they were to accept the student demands and become members of the WRC. </p> <p>This move was just the latest in a series of successes for the sweatshop campaign. Apart from placing the issue firmly on the national corporate agenda, the campaign has forced sportswear giants such as Nike to retreat from their previously held position of never revealing the locations of their factories, to publicly listing all the factories that make clothes for five large American universities.</p> <p>Nike has since gone on the PR offensive, with the Nike boss Phil Knight personally intervening in the damage-limitation exercise, claiming that: \"We are very, very serious about providing good factory working conditions and continuously improve the working experience for all 500,000 people who make Nike products. We are committed to having the best monitoring and remediation process possible and to be open.\" </p> <p>\"These claims are baseless,\" replies Andrew Cornell. \"Independent monitoring groups find shocking violations of working conditions every time they investigate clothing factories.\" In response to the Nike swipe that the full-time student campaigners are only interested in protecting their own jobs and embellishing their CVs, Cornell replies: \"It's just ridiculous. One only needs to look at the salaries that non-profit organisations can afford to pay in order to see that we would be in business school sucking up to Nike recruiters if we were in it for the money.\" </p> <p>Despite these apparent successes, Angela Hale from the UK based anti-sweatshop campaign Women Working Worldwide is sceptical about the overall impact of the student campaign. \"American campaigners might shout louder than campaigners here in Europe, but whether this means that there's been any change to workers' lives is another matter. What happens in American campuses is not going to change working conditions of people in Thailand. That is going to happen through workers' organisations over there.\" </p> <p>However, Hale concedes that the students have played an important role in the debate on sweatshops: \"Raising people's awareness is important to make sure people know what's going on. Workers in the South can gain enormous strength and confidence and extra resources through knowing that student actions are taking place across America.\" </p> <p>And for students like Andrew Cornell, letting the public know about the sweatshop issue is still their number one priority. \"Once people find out about the atrocities committed in the factories where household brand-name clothes are made,\" says Cornell, \"there is nothing no one can do to hold back the resentment towards these 'brand bullies'.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>Moves to reform the university admissions system are expected to gather momentum this month when a review recommends the end of the traditional school year.</p> <p>Proposals to finally replace the long holidays at Christmas, Easter and summer - originally designed to fit into the cycle of harvests and religious holidays - with more frequent breaks between five shorter terms could pave the way for an academic admissions system where students are judged on their A-level grades rather than their predicted scores. </p> <p>It comes amid a raft of new studies investigating fairer ways to assess the academic potential of students, from US-style intelligence tests to the job-selection techniques employed by occupational psychologists. Already one university plans to introduce science reasoning tasks as part of its selection of medical students, after new research showed that A-level grades are often a poor reflection of students' true abilities.</p> <p>To boost the numbers of students from state schools and poor backgrounds entering its medical school, admissions tutors at King's College, London plan to set practical tasks for students applying for courses starting next year. During the same day tutors will assess non-academic characteristics of applicants such as motivation, expectations and personality traits. </p> <p>Last month, Sutton Trust head Peter Lampl reiterated his calls for a post qualification applications system for universities which, he believes, would help encourage more working-class pupils to apply to top universities. Lampl told MPs on the House of Commons education and employment committee about evidence suggesting that even with high, predicted grades, students from state schools are less confident about their prospects than those from private schools. </p> <p>The move towards an admissions system based on actual, not predicted, A-level grades has long been discussed. But last spring negotiations reached an impasse when both university and school sectors refused to change their academic calendars. Most students make applications to universities some eight months before they know their exam results. And every year about 50,000 students, whose grades do not match university offers, enter a frenetic clearing process to apply for the remaining vacancies. </p> <p>All this could change, though, when a commission by the Local Government Association on the school year concludes at the end of the month. It is widely expected to back calls for the school year to be split into five shorter terms and to get rid of the long summer break, organised in medieval times for children to help with annual harvesting work. Under the new school system, students would take A levels in the fourth term of the year, and receive results in July rather than August. </p> <p>The universities and colleges admissions service (UCAS) says it has the computing know-how to introduce a fast track system for student admissions - with students applying electronically on the basis of their grades for courses beginning in October. </p> <p>UCAS has also given the green light to new arrangements preventing admissions officers from seeing applicants' other university choices - so-called \"blind decision-making\". </p> <p>But the use of A levels as the single gold standard for gauging academic abilities is also set to come under renewed attack. Research at King's College London shows that A-level grades often bear little resemblance to the abilities as measured by continuous assessment. </p> <p>There are three main reasons for this: A-level candidates have good and bad days; markers have different opinions; and A-level questions change each year, benefiting some students and hindering others. A simulation of the results of students compared to their \"true\" grades - the average score over repeated examinations - reveals that half of candidates with the highest, simulated grades are in fact awarded grades that under-represent their achievement. But by the same token, some students gain an advantage by the unreliability of A-levels, receiving higher grades than they deserve. </p> <p>The researchers conclude that reducing the grades required from those students with disadvantaged backgrounds could backfire, allowing in students whose real achievements are well below the level that is needed on the medical degree course.

      "bodyText": "Moves to reform the university admissions system are expected to gather momentum this month when a review recommends the end of the traditional school year. Proposals to finally replace the long holidays at Christmas, Easter and summer - originally designed to fit into the cycle of harvests and religious holidays - with more frequent breaks between five shorter terms could pave the way for an academic admissions system where students are judged on their A-level grades rather than their predicted scores. It comes amid a raft of new studies investigating fairer ways to assess the academic potential of students, from US-style intelligence tests to the job-selection techniques employed by occupational psychologists. Already one university plans to introduce science reasoning tasks as part of its selection of medical students, after new research showed that A-level grades are often a poor reflection of students' true abilities. To boost the numbers of students from state schools and poor backgrounds entering its medical school, admissions tutors at King's College, London plan to set practical tasks for students applying for courses starting next year. During the same day tutors will assess non-academic characteristics of applicants such as motivation, expectations and personality traits. Last month, Sutton Trust head Peter Lampl reiterated his calls for a post qualification applications system for universities which, he believes, would help encourage more working-class pupils to apply to top universities. Lampl told MPs on the House of Commons education and employment committee about evidence suggesting that even with high, predicted grades, students from state schools are less confident about their prospects than those from private schools. The move towards an admissions system based on actual, not predicted, A-level grades has long been discussed. But last spring negotiations reached an impasse when both university and school sectors refused to change their academic calendars. Most students make applications to universities some eight months before they know their exam results. And every year about 50,000 students, whose grades do not match university offers, enter a frenetic clearing process to apply for the remaining vacancies. All this could change, though, when a commission by the Local Government Association on the school year concludes at the end of the month. It is widely expected to back calls for the school year to be split into five shorter terms and to get rid of the long summer break, organised in medieval times for children to help with annual harvesting work. Under the new school system, students would take A levels in the fourth term of the year, and receive results in July rather than August. The universities and colleges admissions service (UCAS) says it has the computing know-how to introduce a fast track system for student admissions - with students applying electronically on the basis of their grades for courses beginning in October. UCAS has also given the green light to new arrangements preventing admissions officers from seeing applicants' other university choices - so-called \"blind decision-making\". But the use of A levels as the single gold standard for gauging academic abilities is also set to come under renewed attack. Research at King's College London shows that A-level grades often bear little resemblance to the abilities as measured by continuous assessment. There are three main reasons for this: A-level candidates have good and bad days; markers have different opinions; and A-level questions change each year, benefiting some students and hindering others. A simulation of the results of students compared to their \"true\" grades - the average score over repeated examinations - reveals that half of candidates with the highest, simulated grades are in fact awarded grades that under-represent their achievement. But by the same token, some students gain an advantage by the unreliability of A-levels, receiving higher grades than they deserve. The researchers conclude that reducing the grades required from those students with disadvantaged backgrounds could backfire, allowing in students whose real achievements are well below the level that is needed on the medical degree course. So instead, the medical school plans to introduce an alternative and more accurate selection system for students applying next year: scientific reasoning tasks set for groups of applicants, and lasting about 50 minutes. The tasks will allow tutors to gauge the ability of students to learn and reason as this takes place. Meanwhile, the representation of university admission statistics last month by the Sutton Trust, suggesting that selection based on A-level results is prejudiced against candidates from poor families and state comprehensives, has prompted several studies into US-style intelligence tests to measure 16- to 17-year-olds' aptitude for university. Apart from the Trust's own feasibility study, researchers at University College, London, are now investigating the use of scholastic aptitude tests (SAT) used by the top American universities to assess candidates' academic potential. The Qualification Curriculum Authority has also expressed interest in the tests. The Committee of Vice-chancellors and Principals, meanwhile, is sponsoring a study into whether job analysis techniques employed by occupational psychologists can be used to identify the characteristics of \"good students\" by university admission tutors. It will also consider how universities adapt to the new broad A-level syllabus in schools, unveiled formally by the government last week. The upshot of all this work is likely to be an admissions system more akin to the US model (see below) where tutors use a range of selection procedures. But Lampl, among others, warns that the US system should not be seen as the promised land.

A new report from the Department for Education and Employment notes that nearly half of all 16-year-olds, let alone 17- and 18-year-olds, in full-time education are also in employment. Will this affect their results, as many teachers fear?</p> <p>Through a recent survey we have found evidence to suggest that working long hours can reduce both commitment to study and aspirations to excel. As a year 12 student confided: \"In a perfect world, you'd give up your part-time work and concentrate on your A levels, but you need the money.\" </p> <p>On the other hand, part-time work might be encouraging those young people who may have gone out into the labour market in the past to remain in full-time education because they can study and earn at the same time. \"Work and study builds up the experience of moving on from compulsory education into a time of choice. I don't have to be doing A levels, I don't have to be doing work, but I choose to do both,\" says one year 12 boy. </p> <p>The challenge is to establish a relationship between learning and earning that capitalises on the benefits of employment without jeopardising young peoples' qualifications. Hence the importance of finding a balance. </p> <p>Sixth-form and college students have always had part-time jobs, of course, but these have usually been restricted to weekends and holidays. What our research into patterns of paid work among 2,000 14- to 19-year-olds in the south Gloucestershire area indicates is that 70-80% of 17- to 19-year-olds in that area now have part-time jobs; a significant number are undertaking more than 15 hours a week, and many are working during the week in term time as well as at the weekend and in their holidays. This appears to be the case in other parts of the country, too. </p> <p>Employers, in retailing especially, are keen to recruit bright 16- to 19-year-olds to work part-time to cover unsocial shifts, which older employees (often women with families) are less willing to take on. The increase in the number of hours shops and supermarkets are open has led to a steep demand for more casualised labour. Many young people we spoke to as part of our study originally opted to take on employment on Saturday or Sunday, but they had gradually been drawn into additional hours during the week. The lure is very much financial. As one year 13 student said, \"I didn't need the money before, but now I'd be lost without it.\" </p> <p>The students we interviewed were very positive. They said they had gained a great deal from taking on a part-time job, though some of their friends experienced difficulties in balancing work and study. They spoke enthusiastically about how much more confident they had become as a result of working, particularly in dealing with people and handling money. They liked being financially independent. Many said that the workplace provided an additional dimension to their social life. Several asserted that they would not be able to afford further education unless they had a part-time job. </p> <p>It was clear, too, from what the students said that their parents broadly supported them or even actively encouraged them to get part-time employment. Finally, when asked what effect they felt their work was having on their study, many claimed that it had made them more organised about getting their homework done and helped them with some aspects of their programme. </p> <p>Teachers and lecturers, on the other hand, often voiced anxiety about the detrimental effects, particularly on A-level students. They complained about assignments being late; students being too tired to concentrate properly, not spending enough time on revision and even, in some cases, skipping classes to take on an extra shift at the local supermarket. They were particularly worried that students were not prepared or able to reduce their hours of work around exam time and were, in their view, jeopardising their A-level grades and their chances of getting into a more prestigious university or course. </p> <p>What was clear from our interviews with young people, however, is that many of them are unsure about whether they want to go to university. We called these the \"higher education waverers\". This is partly because they are concerned about how much it is going to cost them: \"It's the money really; I don't like the idea of having a debt hanging over me. It would be a big debt - thousands of pounds,\" said one year 13 boy. Moreover, several young people said they would be satisfied with getting a place at a local university, which would not be too costly and would allow them to stay at home and keep their part-time job. </p> <p>\"I'd like to go to UWE [University of West of England] if anywhere, because it's close to home and it would keep the costs down. I'd choose the course according to what they offer,\" said one year 12 girl. </p> <p>Teachers also recognised that the patterns of application for higher education appear to be changing, and some thought that part-time work could well be playing a role. </p> <p>\"In one way the children are more mature than they used to be, because they've got their jobs and they don't need to go away from home to break with their parents, in the way people used to. In fact, they've got higher status with their parents as adults than perhaps we had, and therefore they don't need to make that cut. They can have the best of both worlds at home,\" said one sixth-form tutor. </p> <p>Since a few of the local universities tend to make low A-level offers, and many students are relying on their results at A level to help them make up their mind about higher education, there is little incentive to give up their part-time work in order to achieve higher grades. </p> <p>The relationship between part-time work and higher education is therefore a complex one: on the one hand, some students are using their earnings from part-time work to save up for higher education; on the other, their involvement in the labour market gives them a tantalising taste of affluence, which studying at university would be likely to deny them. </p> <p>Not all teachers and lecturers see part-time work as a necessary evil. The more we discussed the issue with them, the more they appreciated the potentially positive relationship between learning and earning from an educational perspective. This was particularly the case with GNVQ teachers. As one said, \"Teaching GNVQ business, it's quite useful a lot of the time for them to have some experience of the workplace. They also use their workplace for their assignments.\" </p> <p>However, the majority of students did not make these connections so explicitly and were keen to keep work and study separate. Until now this has been possible because of the relatively low number of taught hours in A-level courses and the fact that application of work-related skills has been confined to vocational programmes such as GNVQ. This \"convenient\" relationship between the low-volume A-level curriculum and part-time work will change in September as a result of the Curriculum 2000 reforms of A levels, GNVQs and the introduction of key skills designed to broaden A levels. </p> <p>Students who would previously have studied three A levels will, for example, probably be taking four AS levels in their first year of study next year. In some instances, these students will also be working towards a key skills certificate in communications, application of number and information technology. For most young people, the number of taught hours is likely to rise by at least five per week. Total study time, including independent study, will thus leave less time for part-time work. </p> <p>There is a real danger, therefore, that students' legitimate desire to gain independence might undermine the thrust of the reforms to broaden their study. Since the reforms are not compulsory, students can drop subjects and this process may be aggravated by their work demands. </p> <p>If our limited research in this area is anything to go by, employers are largely unaware of the effect their employment practices may be having on the education of the students who work for them. </p> <p>Moreover, all the employers we spoke to were totally unaware of the implications Curriculum 2000 might have for work and study patterns. </p> <p>However, at a seminar of teachers, lecturers and employers organised in south Gloucestershire by Learning Partnership West, which focused on the implications of part-time work for students on A-level programmes, it became clear that leading employers were more than willing to play a constructive role. </p> <p>When Curriculum 2000 was explained to them, employers thought it possible to discuss with students how they might use \"flexi-contracting\" to accommodate the new study and assessment demands. They suggested, for example, that if they knew in advance when students were likely to be taking examinations (which will be a much more regular occurrence), they could arrange for reduced working hours at these times. Some employer representatives also showed an interest in helping with the development of key skills. </p> <p>Teachers and lecturers in schools and colleges can also play their part in the process of finding a balance by panicking less about the potential negative effects and using their experience to help students manage their time more effectively. </p> <p>There is a growing consensus that we need to accept part-time work as a reality and to harness its positive features. There is undoubtedly the need for a national study that will result in a more informed debate between schools, colleges, employers, higher education and young people to find the optimum balance for each person and to forge positive connections between education and work.</p> <p>\u0095 Ann Hodgson &amp; Ken Spours lecture at the Institute of Education, University of London.
