      "bodyText": "Japan's jittery financial authorities were shaken yesterday by the resignation of the country's top regulator amid allegations that he accepted hundreds of millions of yen from a leading bank and construction company. Kimitaka Kuze is the second head of the financial reconstruction commission - which is supposed to promote a more modern and transparent banking system - to stand down this year. His decision to quit less than a month after his appointment puts pressure on unpopular prime minister Yoshiro Mori. It casts fresh doubt on the government's ability to modernise a banking sector that remains mired in bad loans dating from the bubble era of the late 1980s. Mr Kazu was left with little choice after revelations that he had accepted 230m yen (\u00a31.4m) in consultant's fees and office rent from Mitsubishi Trust and Banking over a 13 year period to 1996. On Saturday, it also emerged that Daikyo, a residential building company had given him 100m yen (\u00a3620,000) in 1991 to attract new members into the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Neither of these donations was made public. Although they were not illegal at the time, they run contrary to the spirit of openness and fairness that the FRC was created to promote. With a new session of parliament beginning today, Kuze said he stood down to minimise the political fallout from the scandal. \"I apologise for disturbing the public,\" Kuze said. \"I decided to quit this job, although it reflects badly on my honour. I didn't do anything illegal, but I decided to withdraw to prevent political disruption.\" The resignation is likely to raise fresh questions about the competence of prime minister Mori, who selected the FRC chairman while aware of the gifts from Mitsubishi. Mr Kuze had also expressed his reluctance to take up the sensitive and difficult post, which he was poorly qualified to hold. Hiromu Nonaka, secretary-general of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, said Mr Mori - whose poll ratings are hovering around 20% - should not be considered responsible. \"We appointed Kuze after confirming that he hadn't done anything unlawful under the rules at that time,\" Nonaka said. \"The appointment has led to grief, but I don't think the prime minister should be blamed for what happened.\" The leader of the main opposition party, Yukio Hatoyama, rejected this view. \"Of course Kuze should be fired, but that is not the end of the matter,\" he said. \"The prime minister knew the situation when he made the apppointment and thought it was OK. Naturally, he has responsibility for the appointment and the responsibility to explain it.\" Under Mr Kuze, the FRC had to abandon plans to rescue the Sogo department store, which collapsed earlier this month in the second biggest bankruptcy in Japanese corporate history. Amid growing uncertainty about the government's ability to handle similar crises in the future, the Nikkei index of the Tokyo Stock Exchange hit an 18 month low on Friday. The new head of the FRC, Hideyaki Aizawa has the background to restore confidence: he is a former finance ministry bureaucrat who has served as head of the economic planning agency. But at 81 years old, he can hardly claim to be the new broom that the FRC so desperately needs.",

Not only are they refreshingly taking on the undermined PiL/Can legacy, but they are possibly the only group in rock history influenced by the second album from obscure early-80s Blackpool experimentalists, Section 25. You want to applaud such crazy idiosyncrasy, but as their hypnotic, violent trance-scapes reach a stunning climax, there is plenty else to cheer. </p> <p>It's a surprise, then, that when Crescent's female bass player becomes Movietone's lead singer, she sheds the turbulent spirit of her alter ego. Rooted - like the excellent Broadcast - in the hallucinatory 60s sound of Nico and the Doors, Movietone appear to be doing their utmost to make challenging music sound as mundane as possible. Singer Kate is more atonal than Nico ever was (a feat previously thought impossible) but Teutonic menace is replaced by what sounds like trouble with a cold. The introduction of a clarinet makes matters even less tuneful, and the whole performance has the air of a sixth-form school band playing at being psychedelic. Once or twice, they rise above the shambles and the crowd's murmuring to produce something that borders on the dreamlike, but a grim nadir is reached with their descent into Soft Machine jazz noodling. One song shrinks to near silence, with Kate intoning: \"Sleep well.\" Far be it from me to turn down such excellent advice. </p> <p>***** Unmissable **** Recommended *** Enjoyable <br>** Mediocre * Terrible</p>",

Not only are they refreshingly taking on the undermined PiL/Can legacy, but they are possibly the only group in rock history influenced by the second album from obscure early-80s Blackpool experimentalists, Section 25. You want to applaud such crazy idiosyncrasy, but as their hypnotic, violent trance-scapes reach a stunning climax, there is plenty else to cheer. It's a surprise, then, that when Crescent's female bass player becomes Movietone's lead singer, she sheds the turbulent spirit of her alter ego. Rooted - like the excellent Broadcast - in the hallucinatory 60s sound of Nico and the Doors, Movietone appear to be doing their utmost to make challenging music sound as mundane as possible. Singer Kate is more atonal than Nico ever was (a feat previously thought impossible) but Teutonic menace is replaced by what sounds like trouble with a cold. The introduction of a clarinet makes matters even less tuneful, and the whole performance has the air of a sixth-form school band playing at being psychedelic. Once or twice, they rise above the shambles and the crowd's murmuring to produce something that borders on the dreamlike, but a grim nadir is reached with their descent into Soft Machine jazz noodling. One song shrinks to near silence, with Kate intoning: \"Sleep well.\" Far be it from me to turn down such excellent advice. ***** Unmissable **** Recommended *** Enjoyable ** Mediocre * Terrible",

As a metaphor for the individual defying the system that's fine; but the play, like the book and the film, is every bit as manipulative as Nurse Ratched. McMurphy is, in Pauline Kael's unbeatable phrase, a \"jock Christ\"; the Nurse, in contrast, is a starched sadist and punishment freak. We cheer the hero on at every turn; but real drama, as Shaw taught us, only occurs when you give weight to the party you like least. </p> <p>I was also surprised at how sentimental the story now seems. In the 60s lines like \"We're doomed to the terrible burden of sanity\" may have had a fuzzy Laing-ian charm; now we know too much about the problems of care in the community to endorse the idea of privileged insanity. Wasserman's play, like Kesey's novel, is also stuffed with adolescent sexism: the women are either whores or bullies while the men are laddish gamblers and sports nuts. Even McMurphy's arrest for statutory rape is viewed as a harmless prank. If you want to see how much the play softens the issue of state intimidation, compare it with Pinter's The Hothouse, written in 1958: Pinter's point is not just that we classify nonconformity as madness but that the staff are as much victims as the patients. </p> <p>Even if the work itself is jokey melodrama, it is ebulliently staged by Terry Kinney and beautifully acted by the Steppenwolf ensemble. Sinise's McMurphy is vastly superior to Jack Nicholson's self-regarding performance in the movie. What Sinise brings to the party is effortless charisma and infernal cheek: when he twits pedantic Nurse Ratched - who in a therapy session claims: \"I know you but I don't recognise you\" - he becomes the eternal piss-taker whose chosen mission in life is to expose the absurdity of authority. </p> <p>Amy Morton gets round the hellish problem of playing Nurse Ratched by suggesting she is less a medical Mephistopheles than an inflexible rule-follower cursed by a lack of imagination. Tim Sampson endows Chief Bromden, whose native Indian father was naturally emasculated by his white bride, with massive dignity, while Eric Johner lends the stammering Billy Bibbit, whose mental problems are solved by a quick lay, a touching vulnerability.

      "bodyText": "GUNNERS GO COCU Arsenal have lined-up a massive \u00a330m spending spree in a bid to silence fans angry at the sale of Marc Overmars and Emmanuel Petit. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has already inquired about \u00a315m-rated Dutch star Philip Cocu and will go back for Bordeaux striker Sylvain Wiltord. BECKS CAN GO Barcelona have revealed that Alex Ferguson is ready to sell David Beckham after being quoted a \u00a346m asking price. Ferguson rejected, though, a similar approach for Ryan Giggs: 'When I asked about Giggs,' says an official, 'I was told he was priceless.' KOP'S \u00a317M ZIEGE Liverpool are ready to make Middlesbrough's Christian Ziege the highest paid player in their history with a \u00a345,000-a-week contract - \u00a39m over four years. The package will come on top of an \u00a38m transfer fee. Bryan Robson wants Didier Domi to replace him. Arsenal Bordeaux star Sylvain Wiltord has issued the first 'Come and get me' plea of the new season - he's chasing a \u00a315m move to Highbury: 'Sylvain has never hidden his desire to join Arsenal,' said agent Ghislaine Duguperoux last night. A deal for Brazilian midfielder Edu has also been revived, and Brian McGovern is off to Norwich. Aston Villa John Gregory has set David Ginola a seventh deadline to make a decision on a move to Villa Park. The latest cut-off point is today. 'We have to say enough is enough,' says Gregory. 'Either you want to come and play for us or you want to stay where you are.' Man City , meanwhile, are back in for Ugo Ehiogu. Bradford Chris Hutchings has drawn up a list of possible new wingers after a deal for Nicky Summerbee collapsed and Jamie Lawrence demanded a transfer. Liverpool's David Thompson and Tottenham's Ruel Fox are top targets. Charlton Alan Curbishley has dropped a deal for Bulgarian Radostin Kischischevis - offers for Bolton's Mark Fish and Leeds' Michael Duberry also fell through. 'We are trying to buy players but it's increasingly difficult,' says Curbishley. 'Basically there is a huge gap between what we can spend and what players demand.' Chelsea Deportivo La Coruna have made a massive \u00a39m approach for Tore Andre Flo, with Brazilian midfielder star Djalminha offered in part exchange - Coventry though are lining up a rival bid. Coventry Bryan Richardson will hand Gordon Strachan a large chunk of the \u00a313m received from Inter Milan for Robbie Keane. And Strachan's transfer fund could grow further after Middlesbrough bid \u00a32m for Noel Whelan. Derby Jim Smith has taken Australian Con Blatis and Frenchman Youl Mawene on trial - while new signing Bjorn Otto Bragstad links up with the squad this week. 'It has always been my dream to play in the Premiership,' says Bragstad. 'I have thought about it for a long time and am still very happy to be here.' Everton Walter Smith has begun talks with Blackburn for reserve striker Nathan Blake.

'I've seen enough of Joos to know he has that deep desire. I think if you have a good, strong mentality, you're well on the way. I think it's in-bred in top-quality sportsmen and I think Valgaeren is one of them. I like the way he talks when he's asked about himself and his qualities. </p> <p>'You heard him say frequently, \"I'm a sportsman, I want to win\", and that is how a top-quality player should talk. There are parallels to be drawn between him and Matty Elliott, who developed into a marvellous player in the Premiership with Leicester after being around smaller clubs for a few years. </p> <p>'Matty has that same strength of spirit, the will to succeed and it has shown throughout his time with me. I know that last season was an exceptional one for Roy Keane at Manchester United, but I'm convinced that if Elliott had been at one of the top three clubs, giving the same performances he brought for Leicester, he would have been right in the running for player of the year. </p> <p>'Now, the kind of attitude that Matty and Joos possess can be put into players and that's part of my job. And it's something I have to do here at Celtic. I'm trying to change the mentality of some of the players here, because they seem to have been affected by recent failures. </p> <p>'I'm told by some who were here that games last season were lost that shouldn't have been, that it was only discouragement, that habit of losing, that caused it. Now, if you can change that... that's my job... you can make winning a habit.' </p> <p>O'Neill's first competitive test arrives tonight, when Celtic open their campaign with a visit to Tannadice to face Dundee United, who have frequently been awkward opponents in recent times. With Valkgaeren and Chris Sutton his only two new recruits so far - and a decision will have to be made on whether the Belgian is ready for his debut, having arrived only on Thursday - there will be little change in the side that finished 21 points behind Rangers in the championship. </p> <p>One in particular, however, could be of huge significance. It is the return of the Swede Henrik Larsson to attack, following a nine-month absence after breaking a leg last October. O'Neill could not disguise his excitement at the prospect of having him on his side. </p> <p>'Henrik is simply top quality,' he said. 'A very clever player, very unselfish, who makes decisions based on what is most likely to help the team rather than himself. And I don't think anybody here should have any worries whatsoever about Chris Sutton. I certainly don't. If he remains free of injury, take my word for it, he'll do great here. </p> <p>'What I don't want is Chris having the Chelsea experience again. I don't want him getting bogged down if he happens to make a sluggish start. </p> <p>'At Chelsea, he missed some good chances early on and the expectations were so high, and he was involved in a rotation system of selection that didn't help him show his true form. We'll make sure that doesn't happen.' </p> <p>No matter the changes in playing personnel that may be effected in the coming weeks or months, there seems little doubt that the most needed - and, therefore, the most beneficial - contribution is likely to come from Martin O'Neill himself.</p>",

Curiously, throughout these turbulent times, there has been no shortage of volunteers willing to confront what is arguably the most demanding and potentially the most career-threatening job in the British game. There is no great demand for failed messiahs. Martin O'Neill, the eighth appointee since 1988, when the Parkhead club celebrated their centenary by landing the double of league championship and Scottish Cup, is much too astute to make extravagant claims about his own credentials as a redeemer, but he has already imparted the impression that he is properly equipped.

      "body": "<p>Despite exporting hooliganism, enduring years of increasing isolation and pursuing a disastrous 2006 World Cup bidding campaign, English football has a new man at the heart of the European game. </p> <p>Uefa have recruited Mike Lee, the Premier League's spin doctor, to deploy his undoubted presentational talents in their own overdue and wide-ranging makeover. Football Association chairman Geoff Thompson has just been elected to Uefa's ruling executive committee, a welcome first step back into European football's corridors of power for the FA. </p> <p>But it is Lee who will have direct influence in advising Uefa on their battles with the European Union, ongoing power struggle with Fifa and often fractious relations with the G14 group of leading European clubs who last year tried to set up their own breakaway pan-continental super league. Not bad going for a 42-year-old, Sunderland-supporting miner's son from a Wearside pit village. </p> <p>Lee's six years as the Premier League's Svengali of spin has coincided with its transformation into a competition in which grounds are nearly always sold out, tickets cost a small fortune, strip changes arrive almost as quickly as foreign imports, players earn \u00a3500 million a year and one club is worth more than \u00a31 billion. </p> <p>In that time, too, English clubs have at last reasserted themselves in European competition, media companies have begun buying into Premiership clubs and, for good or ill, overseas players have - through their sheer numbers and obvious skills - come to dominate the domestic game. Football's growing wealth and unprecedented popularity has seen lawyers, competition authorities and politicians play increasingly important roles in football's present-day soap opera. It's been a hectic time for Lee, who starts his new job at Uefa's Swiss HQ next Monday. He is relishing the challenge, but has no doubts that the Premier League he leaves behind has been a good thing. </p> <p>'It has delivered a healthy domestic league competition, successful clubs that are also doing well in Europe, that can compete financially with other global clubs, and stadia that are safe and where families can go,' he says. 'A lot of positive things have come out of the very dark days of the 1980s, and people often lose sight of that. They lose a bit of that historical context. People should take more pride in what English football has achieved.' </p> <p>Famously plain-spoken, Lee dismisses 'unrepresentative so-called fans organisations who claim to represent millions and millions of fans' as professional malcontents, but acknowledges that the recurring complaint about high ticket prices - now the dearest in Europe - poses a real challenge for the Premier League's 20 clubs. </p> <p>'Going to, say, the North Bank at Arsenal isn't cheap, but it does represent pretty good value. However, more needs to be done about explaining pricing policies and creating stretch pricing so you can have lower-priced tickets, albeit subsidised by [even] higher-priced tickets.' </p> <p>He denies football today is becoming a rich man's sport. 'Ticket pricing has not disenfranchised huge numbers of fans. Football isn't just there for the corporate client, and I don't know one chairman who thinks it is.' </p> <p>Clubs do genuinely recognise the wisdom of keeping live football accessible to people in every income bracket, he says, citing extra-cheap 'junior junior' tickets for under-10s. </p> <p>I raise the case of a Chelsea fan who recently emailed me complaining that the club he has supported for 30 years has just pushed the price of the cheapest seat for category A games from \u00a324 to \u00a330. As a true Blue, boycotting Stamford Bridge in protest is not an option. So what can he do? Lee replies that the 'customer charters' that top-flight clubs are introducing this autumn will mean 'a lot more explanation and consultation, which will produce some pressures about how clubs go about their pricing policies. Maybe some clubs have got it more right than others.' </p> <p>But these customer charters will not actually stop chairmen from introducing 25 per cent price rises if they wish. Irritation starting to show, Lee delivers the Premiership's bottom line on this sensitive issue: 'It's right that, as in any leisure marketplace, clubs have the freedom as individual businesses to make decisions based on their assessment of their needs as clubs. Most fans think the Premiership is good value for money. And football is a very, very expensive business these days.' </p> <p>Which brings us to players' earnings - another 'challenge', as Lee puts it. 'The spiralling costs of football are mainly down to players' wages. There are pretty widespread concerns among Premier League chairmen about this. But finding a way of resolving it is difficult, particularly if you try to put on restraints, which could see a haemorrhaging of talent abroad.' </p> <p>Under Uefa's barely noticed radical restructuring, Lee will have a crucial role as their first-ever director of communications and public affairs. His brief includes telling the world what Uefa do and why they matter. Research Uefa commissioned showed that people were 'pretty negative' about them. </p> <p>'People only associate Uefa with the Champions League, Uefa Cup and European Championship. They don't know about their investment in youth, women's and five-a-side football, their funding programmes in eastern Europe and Africa or their land-mines campaign.' </p> <p>So Uefa face their own challenges, to coin a favourite Lee cliche. Relations with Fifa are spiky, not least because Sepp Blatter beat Uefa president Lennart Johansson to the Fifa presidency in 1998, in what many interpreted as an historic shift of world football power away from Europe. Not so, counters Lee. He says Uefa's recent successful campaign against Fifa's plan to impose a standardised world football calendar shows their influence is still strong, as, crucially, does Germany's largely unexpected triumph over South Africa in the 2006 race. </p> <p>He likens the relationship between Uefa and Fifa to that between the Premier League and FA. 'Some clashes occasionally are inevitable. But on all the major issues currently confronting European football, Uefa and Fifa are at one.' Such as on the campaign for a special EU protocol on sport that would allow them to limit the number of overseas players. </p> <p>One key issue, though, is non-negotiable: no European breakaway will ever be allowed and the G14 group will never be recognised. 'That threat is still bubbling away in the background,' Lee confirms. </p> <p>But he believes the decisive factor that will dissuade the G14 from setting up their own competition is that 'instinctively football wants its own future in its own hands; it doesn't want the EC or Media Partners determining its own future. You can't allow major decisions to be based in one particular media HQ.' Spoken like a man who has never heard of Sky TV.</p>",

So that's that one sorted. In the week that Figo's move caused the Daily Express to ask '\u00a340 million to sign one player. Has the Game Finally Gone Crazy?' it is right and proper that we should consider those less fortunate, if only to restore a sense of perspective. </p> <p>In 1985-86, Ron Pountney, three times Southend player of the year during a decade spent at Roots Hall, was given a free transfer by Bobby Moore. I thought I had a couple of years left in me, easy,' says Pountney. 'I was 30 then. But the manager didn't think so. So we parted company.' </p> <p>His disappointment was slightly diminished by the prospect of a big pay-day from a testimonial match against West Ham. The brochures were printed, the tickets were printed and 'Then the Football League made West Ham play a re-arranged fixture at Anfield on the same night. I've still got all the tickets in a drawer somewhere here.' </p> <p>Last year, he tried again. This time before the brochures could even be printed, let alone the tickets, the Intertoto Cup intervened and the plans were scuppered once again. 'We didn't have a definite date, but we had a definite \"Yes\",' says Ron. 'But after that, I thought, that's it. It's finished.' </p> <p>Yet still people campaigned and when other players were offered testimonials there were letters to the Evening Echo pointing out that Pountney had still not been recognised. </p> <p>It helped that he still lived in the area. 'I'd bought my house off Southend and I had to decorate it myself. So I gave it a whirl and I haven't been out of work since.' </p> <p>Earlier this year, he was once again approached by loyal supporters and, despite initial reluctance, he was convinced by Hugh Cumberland and Paul Fitzgerald to give it one more go. This time, with Gary Nelson's assistance, they went for Charlton. They will be bringing their first-team squad for a full 90-minute game at 7.45pm on Tuesday at Roots Hall. Prior to that, at 6.30-ish, there will be a 30-minute kick-about as Ronnie and his mates take on a London All Stars team including Geoff Pike, Trevor Putney and Mickey Hazard. After the match, there will be a memorabilia auction in The Shrimpers, which will include a pair of Nigel Martyn gloves. Later in the week, a Stan Collymore signed shirt will be auctioned off on local radio. </p> <p>If you can't make it, donations (made payable to 'Ron Pountney Testimonial Fund') can be sent to Hugh Cumberland, Kia Ora, Pudsey Hall, Canewdon, Essex SS4 3RY.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ron Pountney, ex-Southend United, Gravesend and Basildon, never thought his name would appear in the same sentence as Luis Figo, ex-Barcelona and now Real Madrid. So that's that one sorted. In the week that Figo's move caused the Daily Express to ask '\u00a340 million to sign one player. Has the Game Finally Gone Crazy?' it is right and proper that we should consider those less fortunate, if only to restore a sense of perspective. In 1985-86, Ron Pountney, three times Southend player of the year during a decade spent at Roots Hall, was given a free transfer by Bobby Moore. I thought I had a couple of years left in me, easy,' says Pountney. 'I was 30 then. But the manager didn't think so. So we parted company.' His disappointment was slightly diminished by the prospect of a big pay-day from a testimonial match against West Ham. The brochures were printed, the tickets were printed and 'Then the Football League made West Ham play a re-arranged fixture at Anfield on the same night. I've still got all the tickets in a drawer somewhere here.' Last year, he tried again. This time before the brochures could even be printed, let alone the tickets, the Intertoto Cup intervened and the plans were scuppered once again. 'We didn't have a definite date, but we had a definite \"Yes\",' says Ron. 'But after that, I thought, that's it. It's finished.' Yet still people campaigned and when other players were offered testimonials there were letters to the Evening Echo pointing out that Pountney had still not been recognised. It helped that he still lived in the area. 'I'd bought my house off Southend and I had to decorate it myself. So I gave it a whirl and I haven't been out of work since.' Earlier this year, he was once again approached by loyal supporters and, despite initial reluctance, he was convinced by Hugh Cumberland and Paul Fitzgerald to give it one more go. This time, with Gary Nelson's assistance, they went for Charlton. They will be bringing their first-team squad for a full 90-minute game at 7.45pm on Tuesday at Roots Hall. Prior to that, at 6.30-ish, there will be a 30-minute kick-about as Ronnie and his mates take on a London All Stars team including Geoff Pike, Trevor Putney and Mickey Hazard. After the match, there will be a memorabilia auction in The Shrimpers, which will include a pair of Nigel Martyn gloves. Later in the week, a Stan Collymore signed shirt will be auctioned off on local radio. If you can't make it, donations (made payable to 'Ron Pountney Testimonial Fund') can be sent to Hugh Cumberland, Kia Ora, Pudsey Hall, Canewdon, Essex SS4 3RY.",

However Motherwell were struggling to create any clear-cut chances and the visitors soon regained their composure and made it 2-0 with a goal from the impressive Artero. St Mirren, back in the top flight after an eight-year absence, came close to winning but were ultimately denied when a Gary Holt goal earned Kilmarnock the points. St Mirren had started the stronger side but faded after Holt's second-half goal and, on this evidence, will struggle to survive in the Scottish Premier League. Mark Yardley, last year's top scorer for the Saints, came closest for the home side when his shot in the ninth minute scraped over the crossbar.",

      "body": "<p>Courtney Walsh is 38 next birthday. He should be relaxing on a golf course or brushing up on his DIY skills instead of putting the fear of God into England. Yet, come Thursday at Old Trafford, that's just what he'll be attempting to do. </p> <p>I was 34 when I stopped playing Test cricket for England back in 1965. I knew it was time to go. All fast bowlers know and I suspect Courtney knows it too as he has already announced that this is last hurrah as a tourist in England. </p> <p>Walsh has nothing left to prove. Nor does his formidable new-ball partner, Curtly Ambrose, just one year younger. This year, Walsh surpassed Kapil Dev's world record haul of Test wickets - a mark that belonged to me back in the Sixties - and his record will always stand muster. But I suspect he has been prompted to carry on for so long by the lighter workload of today's strike bowlers and the lack of natural successors in the Caribbean. </p> <p>Only Courtney himself truly knows if he is starting to slide from the high standard every truly world-class fast bowler sets himself. But I can tell you what the tell-tale signs are. How do I know - because they happen to all quick bowlers, myself included. </p> <p>The most important sign is that the thin snicks that go to first slip or the wicketkeeper are fewer and farther between. Instead, the batsman gets more of a bat on your delivery and the edge, thicker now, starts going past gully; the decision you make to shake up the batsman after he's just hit one back over your head is met not with trepidation - but with calm and confidence. You don't frighten them any more. </p> <p>Then when you wake you don't leap out of bed to face the task ahead. Instead you fall out. And, at the other end of the day, when play is over, you stay longer than ever before in a hot bath. Yes, it's time to go. </p> <p>I stopped playing county cricket for Yorkshire at about the age Courtney is now. I could, possibly, have gone on for another year or two if they'd agreed to give me a second benefit. They saw fit not to and that brings me on to my point about workload. </p> <p>Today's players would baulk at the load I faced against the West Indies in 1957 when we met at Trent Bridge. England went into the game with only four recognised bowlers - myself, Brian Statham, Trevor Bailey and Tony Lock. When Bailey was injured, it left three of us to do the donkey work after Tom Graveney's double-hundred inspired us to 619 for six declared. I took five for 65 in the first innings as the Windies were bowled out for 372. Skipper Peter May, despite our protests, enforced the follow-on and the hard work started all over again. This time the West Indies got 367 and the match ended in a draw but only after I'd bowled 65 overs (nine wickets) in the game and Statham got through 70 overs. It was murder. </p> <p>So, by those standards, the players we'll see in Manchester on Thursday are cosseted. No wonder Walsh and Ambrose are still going strong, but I fancy the tourists are going to struggle once this twin-pronged assault team finally call it a day. </p> <p>The other pacemen on the tour are Nixon McLean, Franklyn Rose and Reon King. None of them, in my judgment, looks capable of reaching the standards set by Walsh and Ambrose who both learned so much from coming through into their Test side while great performers such as the late Malcolm Marshall - remembered last week in a memorial game in London - and Michael Holding were still running in. </p> <p>This is essentially a two-man attack and that should be some comfort to Marcus Trescothick of Somerset and Yorkshire's Michael Vaughan who will both want to impress. It's vital for both men, especially Trescothick on his debut, to really concentrate. It's the mental application that differs so drastically between the five-day game and the commercial one-day enterprise we have just been through. </p> <p>Trescothick did magnificently in those games, but he knows that Old Trafford will be very different. Some of the West Indies players know it too - they did not even bother with the one-day stuff. Walsh and Ambrose gave it a wide berth, resting themselves for the rigours ahead in the remaining Tests while Sherwin Campbell left the country to be with his wife during the birth of their child. In truth, the West Indies treated the NatWest series with contempt. </p> <p>So Trescothick and Vaughan can expect a refreshed Walsh and Ambrose on Thursday. But it would be terrific if England responded by winning at Old Trafford and then taking the series. It would give the game the most enormous boost in this country from the Test players to the grassroots. </p> <p>It can be done. When I look at the opposition I can't help but compare them with the first West Indies side I faced in 1950. Their side included Allan Rae, a fine opening left-hand bat; Jeff Stollmeyer, the other opener who later skippered the side; Gerry Gomez, dependable in the middle order; Lance Pierre, a right-arm fast bowler; skipper John Goddard, another all-rounder; Prior Jones, who could move the ball either way off the seam; spinner Sonny Ramadhin and his left-arm partner Alf Valentine. Then there were the three Ws - Clyde Walcott, a terrific bat who also kept wicket, his good pal Frank Worrell, who was to have such a great 1950 series against England, and the stylish Everton Weekes. </p> <p>So pardon me when I cast an eye over the present West Indies side and declare that I'm underwhelmed. Brian Lara, of course, is absolute class when he's in the mood. So are Walsh and Ambrose, but they are carrying the side. I'm afraid this is the worst Windies side I've seen in 50 years - and I've seen a few since that day at Bradford's Park Avenue all those years ago. The time is right for England to strike. Let's hope they can take their chance.</p>",

Andrew Flintoff was precisely placed 25 yards in from the square leg boundary; Smethurst duly delivered a bouncer and McGrath duly hooked the ball with no great power straight into Flintoff's hands.

They might have been murmuring about Darren Gough's absence - he was having a game for the Academy side yesterday - shaking their heads at a central contract system that will deny them crucial players in the Championship run-in. There were plenty of heads to shake by modern standards - about 2,500 yesterday, more than 3,000 on Friday.

      "body": "<p>Some things never change. We were 10 minutes late, but eventually, with a whistle and a gust of steam, we were off. Perhaps because it was a Tuesday, and the first train of the day, there was only a smattering of 'railway enthusiasts' (the polite term for trainspotters) and a large family with young children in my carriage. </p> <p>The headquarters of the Watercress Line, the route by which watercress from Hampshire water meadows made its way to London markets, is at Alresford. Period details (1923 to 1947 to be precise), such as tin adverts for Capstan Navy Cut cigarettes and old-fashioned luggage trolleys, crowd the station - the uniformed guards and station master even sport fob watches. </p> <p>Within minutes we had built up a steady rhythm, and the canopy of trees vanished above billows of steam. At Ropley we passed the sheds where engines are restored and maintained. Rusting shells stood next to antique coaches and colossal locomotives like flagship Bodmin (number 34016), sparkling in its green and black livery. 'That one looks like Henry,' sang the children. </p> <p>Mike Burke, the driver, worked for British Rail for 40 years. Seventeen years ago he began volunteering on the Watercress Line and has driven steam engines for the past five years. His footplate crew includes a fireman (the man who shovels coal into the furnace) and a trainee, the Rev Peter Hutchinson who spends his weekends in slightly less infernal surroundings. </p> <p>These machines are behemoths. Our locomotive, a freight engine designed by a Scot, Robert Urie, and built in 1920, is 120 tonnes of cast steel. It was retired in 1966 but, as Mike points out, it was obviously designed to last 100 years and more. Mike ran through a few figures: the optimum temperature for the furnace is 6,000F. It gobbles one tonne of coal during a one-hour round trip from Alresford to Alton and back again. </p> <p>I asked him what the special appeal of steam trains was. 'I do this for the exhilaration - these are living machines,' he said. There is no doubt that the footplate is where the action is: there is a furious heat from the furnace and coal dust, grease, dials, levers and noise everywhere else. </p> <p>But despite all this activity, steam travel is far from quick. 'The engines are capable of 70 miles per hour, but we are limited to 25 by law. However the track is currently being upgraded so we can go up to 50 miles per hour, which will make us the fastest steam railway in the country,' says Mike, with a gleam in his eye. </p> <p> Watercress Line trains run throughout the summer and there are several special events.

      "body": "<p>Heard the one about the twins separated at birth who don't meet each other for 52 years? When they do get together, it's embarrassing and difficult to be more than merely polite. Sometimes it works, sometimes both wish they had stayed strangers. That's the story of Eilat and Aqaba, two towns 15 minutes apart that are taking the first halting steps towards getting to know each other. </p> <p>In any other part of the world, there would be no problem. But this is the Middle East. Eilat is in Israel. Aqaba is in Jordan. Politically, they were a million miles apart. </p> <p>But they could now be brought together in a way no one would have thought possible a decade back. There's cautious optimism that this could be a reunion to die for - as hundreds of thousands of people have. </p> <p>Already it is possible to cross the frontier for a double holiday, staying in what is rapidly becoming the Middle Eastern Riviera in Eilat, then moving to Aqaba, a typical Arab town and beach resort with miles of coastline that have never seen even a deckchair. </p> <p>But it's a bureaucratic mishmash. Traffic is mostly one-way: Israelis going to Jordan. You drive over from the last place where the blue-and-white Star of David flag flies, and go through security and passport control. You next walk 100 yards or so (with your luggage, and generally without trolleys) to be greeted by Jordanian frontier guards who demand your passports and about \u00a320 for a visa. The sum varies. Both sides seem to change their minds about how much they want every time the wind alters direction. One country makes a decision, the other matches it. </p> <p>Yet all this is set to change and the twins could even become triplets in time, taking in the Egyptian resort of Taba, just across the Red Sea from Aqaba. Taba now consists of little more than an hotel and a casino. </p> <p>The day I was in Aqaba, talks had begun between Israel and Jordan to allow ferries to cross the five miles or so of Red Sea between the two countries, which the Jordanians and almost everyone else call the Gulf of Aqaba and which Israelis know as the Gulf of Eilat. The idea is that both sides would respect each other's customs and security proce dures. This would also allow cruise ships to visit both places, instead of one or the other, which is what happens now. The ships would anchor at sea and send out tenders to both Aqaba and Eilat simultaneously. You could go back to your ship for lunch and then switch countries. </p> <p>If Egypt joins the talks, all three nations might agree to do away with the bureaucracy of customs and security. </p> <p>And it could all happen soon. What might take a little longer is a joint Eilat-Aqaba airport. At present, Eilat airport is in the centre of the town, like an old railway station. It is suitable only for planes from other parts of Israel. To travel to the resort from abroad on one of the twice-weekly El Al or Superstar flights from Heathrow, for instance, you have to use a former military airstrip in the desert 45 minutes away. Aqaba, however, has an underdeveloped airport that already has received Concorde. The plan now is that runways at Aqaba would serve both towns - and both countries. Again, there would be joint customs and immigration facilities, and no visa charges for Britons. </p> <p>The only snag is that the site of the planned Israeli terminal is in a bird sanctuary and bird watchers represent an important slice of Eilat's tourist market. The project will probably happen anyway. </p> <p> Holiday development in the area has a lot to do with a London businessman, David Lewis. Tour the Eilat area in one of the glass-bottomed boats that patrol some of the world's most glorious corals and the guide will talk about the way Lewis has revolutionised this, Israel's most southern point. </p> <p>'We talk about before and after David Lewis,' said Rina Maor, director of the Ministry of Tourism for the area. And it is easy to see why. Unofficially, locals have dubbed part of Eilat 'Lewisville'. He has six hotels catering for all tastes, with another two being built. The luxurious Royal Beach is one of the most elegant resort hotels I have visited. It has three superb swimming pools, vast lounges and, for those on the 'presidential floors', a special lounge with a terrace overlooking a pool. There, snacks are served all day and a bottle of local sparkling wine in an ice bucket is always ready. </p> <p>Lewis's other hotels range from the five-star King Solomon's Palace to the self-catering Ambassador. </p> <p>Significantly, Lewis is now building a hotel in Aqaba, too, thanks to a suggestion put to him by a member of the Jordanian royal family at a banquet five years ago on the day the peace treaty between the two countries was signed. That alone seems to show that there is something about the peace process that is working. The Arab town has only 1,000 hotel rooms. Eilat has more than five times that number. Lewis and his son, Simon, are creating an Aqaba hotel that will be virtually self-sufficient, although with regular shuttle links to the town . Of course, Aqaba is no more a place on its own than is Eilat. From the Israeli resort, you can travel to Tel Aviv, Jerusalem or Galilee. Aqaba is the gateway to the Arab world- two hours from Petra, the jewel of Jordan. </p> <p>You immediately see three countries from the Aqaba beaches, as you can from Eilat. The Israeli hotels look as close as the tower- blocks down the road in an average British suburb. A yard or two further along the horizon is Egypt and once you have driven from the Israeli border it's but a five-minute ride to the Saudi Arabian frontier. </p> <p>Both towns have ports. Aqaba is the Red Sea outlet to Iraq, with consequences that became apparent during the Gulf war. Both Jordan and Israel are trying to underplay the ports' role and put more emphasis on tourism. Both sets of docks are to be moved to provide a cleaner sweep of beaches, </p> <p>The Aqaba hotel will be run by his Israeli chain, Isrotel, under a different name, but staffed by Jordanians. Lewis - a 75-year-old former RAF navigator who built up hotels in Spain as well as the River Island clothing empire- doesn't want to be thought to be telling the Jordanians their business. 'I have much too much respect for them to do that,' he says. </p> <p>Not everyone is enthusiastic. I suggest to Yousef Dalabeeh, president of the Aqaba Regional Authority, that tourism would be one of the principal ways of guaranteeing the peace between the two countries. 'No,' he corrected me. 'That is not the way. First, we must have a real peace that is felt by the people - and that is still dragging behind. Then we can talk about joint tourism.' But I had the feeling that this wasn't a universally held view in Aqaba. The manager of the Radisson-SAS hotel there says: 'Tourism will very definitely help peace.' </p> <p>The fear is that Aqaba may become a copy of the brightly lit Eilat. Dalabeeh stresses: 'The Aqaba people are different. The culture is different.' The quiet boulevard outside the Radison Hotel wouldn't fit in to Eilat at all. You're as likely to see a camel, escorted by a man in flowing robes and red head-dress, racing down the road as you are a Mercedes. </p> <p> The Aqaba authorities are very conscious of protecting their environment, which is why the coral reef there is protected by wardens; something the Israelis wish they had done years ago. 'The environment and development are enemies,' Dalabeeh says. </p> <p>Nevertheless, there is a feeling that the Aqaba tourist industry is envious of Eilat's achievements, particularly such projects as its sophisticated underwater observatory, stretching deep through the coral to provide views of the beautifully coloured fish. There is scuba diving as well as snuba diving, a combination of scuba and snorkel. For \u00a325, you can hire equipment to comb the depths, attached to a line that will haul you up at a moment's notice. Aqaba, however, does have a simpler version. </p> <p>If you prefer dry land, Eilat has Jeep trips into the desert and camel rides. If Aqaba adopts all these things,too, it might indeed run into the danger of resembling Eilat a little too closely. </p> <p>But the head of the Eilat Hotel Association, Alon Dekel, says: 'Making the two towns alike would defeat the whole purpose of the two-centre holiday. We want people to visit us both - because we are different.\" </p> <p>Eilat is also different from the place it used to be. Blink and there's a new hotel gone up, a new marina installed. When I first went there 27 years ago there were three small hotels, a parade of rundown shops and a few sleazy restaurants. There weren't even any traffic lights. When Lewis first visited it in the early Sixties, he says, it was 'like the Wild West', with one hotel. 'They used to joke,' said Dekel, 'that Israeli judges would send convicts to Eilat when the prisons were full.' </p> <p>One thing that doesn't change is the weather. Europeans know it as a winter holiday destination, with temperatures approaching 80F at Christmas. </p> <p>Lewis says: 'I first came here from Tel Aviv where it was grey and wet. I arrived to find blue skies and sunshine - and that was when I decided to build here, in a place that nearly always has blue skies and sunshine.' </p> <p>If Lewis does bridge the gap between Israel and Jordan with his new hotel he will have performed what would once have seemed a miracle. But, as people used to say in that part of the world, the impossible occurs all the time, miracles take a little longer. </p> <p>\u0095 Michael Freedland was a guest of the Royal Beach Hotel, Eilat, and the Radison SAS Hotel, Aqaba.

      "bodyText": "Heard the one about the twins separated at birth who don't meet each other for 52 years? When they do get together, it's embarrassing and difficult to be more than merely polite. Sometimes it works, sometimes both wish they had stayed strangers. That's the story of Eilat and Aqaba, two towns 15 minutes apart that are taking the first halting steps towards getting to know each other. In any other part of the world, there would be no problem. But this is the Middle East. Eilat is in Israel. Aqaba is in Jordan. Politically, they were a million miles apart. But they could now be brought together in a way no one would have thought possible a decade back. There's cautious optimism that this could be a reunion to die for - as hundreds of thousands of people have. Already it is possible to cross the frontier for a double holiday, staying in what is rapidly becoming the Middle Eastern Riviera in Eilat, then moving to Aqaba, a typical Arab town and beach resort with miles of coastline that have never seen even a deckchair. But it's a bureaucratic mishmash. Traffic is mostly one-way: Israelis going to Jordan. You drive over from the last place where the blue-and-white Star of David flag flies, and go through security and passport control. You next walk 100 yards or so (with your luggage, and generally without trolleys) to be greeted by Jordanian frontier guards who demand your passports and about \u00a320 for a visa. The sum varies.

As a 'political volcano' he is extinct, not dormant, he insists.</p> <p>Sillars' career has been an extraordinary obstacle race. He started as a talented young Labour MP, responded to the rise of nationalism by founding the short-lived Scottish Labour Party in 1975 and finally joined the SNP, winning the Govan by-election in 1987. Throughout this, Alex Neil, left-wing fundamentalist candidate for the leadership, has been a close companion.</p> <p>Sillars married the sea soned SNP campaigner Margo MacDonald in 1981.</p> <p>In the Scottish Parliament his wife has increasingly run foul of the leadership with her complaints that the party is in danger of submerging its core aims as it acts as the opposition to the ruling Labour and Lib Dem coalition.</p> <p>Speaking in his London office last week - he is assistant to the secretary-general of the Arab-British Chamber of Commerce - he told The Observer that party leaders couldn't have it both ways.</p> <p>It was, he recalled, Mike Russell, the party's former chief executive and now its manager of parliamentary business, who had called him an 'extinct volcano' in the first place. He said there 'seems to be some degree of contradiction' with the idea that he was a sinister influence in the background.</p> <p>The 'Sillarsite' tag had been hung around Neil's neck to discredit his bid for the leadership, he believes: 'I seem to be a bogeyman for some of them.'</p> <p>Neil is expected to take on John Swinney in a straight fight at the party conference in September, but Sillars denies that his friendship had influenced Neil. 'He is a mature individual. He has very considerable international business experience. He has formed his own opinions.</p> <p>'He and I share the same philosophy. We come from the Ayrshire labour movement that's where our roots are. Alex is the son of a miner, I'm the son of a railwayman.'</p> <p>Sillars makes 'no bones' about using his column in the Scottish Sun to influence opinion. When Salmond announced he was stepping down from the leadership after 10 years, Sillars used the column to dismiss him as 'manipulative to the end'.</p> <p>He said: 'I don't share the general mythology of Alex's leadership. I don't share it at all. I've seen it from inside and outside.' There was a whole range of policies 'enunciated' by Salmond which in fact never occurred, he said. Salmond had softened the party's attitude to devolution and could have extracted much more from Labour.</p> <p>Sillars himself abstained in the devolution referendum because the Parliament, he judged, had insufficient powers. His criticism of Salmond's policies extends to his style - or the lack of it.</p> <p>He had been disturbed by leaks in the press that Salmond and his followers wanted to 'crush' the Sillarsites and 'silence them forever'. 'This makes the blood run cold in a democratic society,' he said. 'There's an authoritarian streak that's part of the legacy of Alex Salmond's leadership.'</p> <p>He thought Salmond would continue to exercise influence, but added: 'He's history, like me.' Sillars believes that Westminster, with its long experience of dealing with quasi-colonial situations, had sucked the SNP into the devolution settlement.</p> <p>Instead of being critical of the Scottish Parliament, the SNP had been seduced into happily sitting on committees and drafting speeches. If at some point in the future the SNP grew restive, Westminster would concede a little more, while retaining control of the real levers of power.</p> <p>If Sillars were running SNP policy he would run that 'incremental' technique in reverse. He would keep trying to win a little more power. 'I have never believed the orthodox view that Scotland's public finances are in structural deficit. Gordon Brown himself has said that the oil revenues have been wasted'.</p> <p>In his view, the next general election had to be fought with the purpose of expanding the core nationalist vote and, as a fallback, on the platform of increasing the powers of the Scottish Parliament.</p> <p>Sillars, who regards England as a 'friendly foreign country' where he happens to earn his living, said one of the most urgent problems facing Scotland was its alienated underclass, treated not as victims but as culprits.</p> <p>They were, he said, part of what Thatcherism produced. 'I think that Scottish society has a better chance of dealing with them because there's an egalitarianism and still a very significant social conscience.'</p> <p>According to Sillars, they had found a champion in Tommy Sheridan, MSP. Sillars believed his Scottish Socialist Party posed a threat both to Labour and the SNP.</p> <p>He said: 'I'm very fond of Tommy as an individual. I went through the poll tax with him. People shouldn't underestimate the genuine anger that fuels Tommy Sheridan and the people who are joining his party.'</p> <p>But the problem for Tommy 'and for me', said Sillars, was that Sheridan was part of a broad socialist movement which was at a low 'theoretical and intellectual ebb'.</p> <p>Is he a threat to the SNP?</p> <p>'Of course he is. We haven't given him enough reasons to join.' Sillars has often despaired of the political mission he has embraced. Once he said it was like pushing water uphill. At another time, he said the Scots were '90-minute patriots', meaning their nationalism lasted about as long as the football games into which they used to vent so many of their feelings.</p> <p>Does he still believe it?</p> <p>Sillars looks a little sad. 'Yes,' he said, 'except that now that rugby's the game, I suppose you can make that 80 minutes.'</p>",

Speaking in his London office last week - he is assistant to the secretary-general of the Arab-British Chamber of Commerce - he told The Observer that party leaders couldn't have it both ways. It was, he recalled, Mike Russell, the party's former chief executive and now its manager of parliamentary business, who had called him an 'extinct volcano' in the first place. He said there 'seems to be some degree of contradiction' with the idea that he was a sinister influence in the background. The 'Sillarsite' tag had been hung around Neil's neck to discredit his bid for the leadership, he believes: 'I seem to be a bogeyman for some of them.' Neil is expected to take on John Swinney in a straight fight at the party conference in September, but Sillars denies that his friendship had influenced Neil. 'He is a mature individual. He has very considerable international business experience. He has formed his own opinions. 'He and I share the same philosophy. We come from the Ayrshire labour movement that's where our roots are. Alex is the son of a miner, I'm the son of a railwayman.' Sillars makes 'no bones' about using his column in the Scottish Sun to influence opinion. When Salmond announced he was stepping down from the leadership after 10 years, Sillars used the column to dismiss him as 'manipulative to the end'. He said: 'I don't share the general mythology of Alex's leadership. I don't share it at all. I've seen it from inside and outside.' There was a whole range of policies 'enunciated' by Salmond which in fact never occurred, he said. Salmond had softened the party's attitude to devolution and could have extracted much more from Labour. Sillars himself abstained in the devolution referendum because the Parliament, he judged, had insufficient powers. His criticism of Salmond's policies extends to his style - or the lack of it. He had been disturbed by leaks in the press that Salmond and his followers wanted to 'crush' the Sillarsites and 'silence them forever'. 'This makes the blood run cold in a democratic society,' he said. 'There's an authoritarian streak that's part of the legacy of Alex Salmond's leadership.' He thought Salmond would continue to exercise influence, but added: 'He's history, like me.' Sillars believes that Westminster, with its long experience of dealing with quasi-colonial situations, had sucked the SNP into the devolution settlement. Instead of being critical of the Scottish Parliament, the SNP had been seduced into happily sitting on committees and drafting speeches. If at some point in the future the SNP grew restive, Westminster would concede a little more, while retaining control of the real levers of power. If Sillars were running SNP policy he would run that 'incremental' technique in reverse. He would keep trying to win a little more power. 'I have never believed the orthodox view that Scotland's public finances are in structural deficit. Gordon Brown himself has said that the oil revenues have been wasted'. In his view, the next general election had to be fought with the purpose of expanding the core nationalist vote and, as a fallback, on the platform of increasing the powers of the Scottish Parliament. Sillars, who regards England as a 'friendly foreign country' where he happens to earn his living, said one of the most urgent problems facing Scotland was its alienated underclass, treated not as victims but as culprits. They were, he said, part of what Thatcherism produced. 'I think that Scottish society has a better chance of dealing with them because there's an egalitarianism and still a very significant social conscience.' According to Sillars, they had found a champion in Tommy Sheridan, MSP. Sillars believed his Scottish Socialist Party posed a threat both to Labour and the SNP. He said: 'I'm very fond of Tommy as an individual. I went through the poll tax with him. People shouldn't underestimate the genuine anger that fuels Tommy Sheridan and the people who are joining his party.' But the problem for Tommy 'and for me', said Sillars, was that Sheridan was part of a broad socialist movement which was at a low 'theoretical and intellectual ebb'. Is he a threat to the SNP? 'Of course he is. We haven't given him enough reasons to join.' Sillars has often despaired of the political mission he has embraced. Once he said it was like pushing water uphill. At another time, he said the Scots were '90-minute patriots', meaning their nationalism lasted about as long as the football games into which they used to vent so many of their feelings. Does he still believe it? Sillars looks a little sad. 'Yes,' he said, 'except that now that rugby's the game, I suppose you can make that 80 minutes.'",

      "body": "<p>'Still smiling?' asks my instructor, Adrian, as our two-seater glider ploughs a furrow in the earth and crunches to a halt in the middle of a field. Technically, it is a perfect landing, but to me - accustomed to the charter-flight luxury of Tarmac, a jet engine and soft rubber tyres - Adrian's touchdown at the London Gliding Club near Dunstable, in Bedfordshire, has all the elegance of crashing a sledge at high speed. </p> <p>That's the problem with gliding: it is so far removed from the average person's experience of flying, it seems totally mad and counter-intuitive. No wonder not many people try it. First, there is the paradox of being airborne without power, a concept even more baffling than a 747 staying in the air. These carbon-fibre albatrosses with their giant wingspans can travel 500 miles, remain aloft for hours and hurtle along at 100mph or more. How do they do it? Then there is the absence of an airstrip: you take off from a field full of rabbits and skylarks, then, if your flight goes pear-shaped, land just about anywhere you like. The day before my course, a pilot came down in a field of oilseed rape - as the yellow stains on his trainers proved. </p> <p>In the cockpit with Adrian Hobbs, I learn about other manoeuvres that defy logic. If the glider 'stalls' and goes into a spin, you point its nose towards the ground rather than up into the air, as self-preservation dictates. Once it stops spinning, you gently pull out of the dive. To 'bank' left, you push the joystick to the left - which is logical enough. Then, when you return the stick to its central position, absolutely nothing happens. </p> <p>The plane continues to turn in a graceful circle until you push the lever way over to the right. Teenagers weaned on Nintendo don't have a problem with this, apparently, while anyone who has steered a yacht or a car does. If you can get your head around 'driving' in three dimensions and the mystery of being airborne at all, gliding isn't as terrifying as it seems. In fact, it is marketed as a safe sport for everyone from 12-year-olds to pensioners. 'If you can manage a walk in the country,' says the London Gliding Club's brochure, 'you should have no problem.' (You also have to be mobile enough to fold yourself into a cramped cockpit, and tall enough to reach the controls.) As part of its training initiative, the club runs holiday courses suitable for families at its centre on Dunstable Downs, ranging from a single trial flight (\u00a335) to a five-day programme (from \u00a3349). The longer courses are residential, using bed and breakfast places, caravans or bunkhouses at the club (\u00a330). Many students go solo after between eight and 12 hours of accompanied flying. </p> <p>The course I am on is Flight 2000 Plus, featuring a safety lesson, two launches and an hour or so in the air 'some of it at the controls, but mostly as a passenger. Unnervingly, it includes a briefing about parachutes. At first, I think Adrian is joking when he passes me the blue backpack and tells me to strap it on. As he talks me through the ejection procedure, showing me the lever that jettisons the cockpit canopy, sweat forms icicles in my armpits. 'To release the chute,' he says, 'pull the red pin. Don't feel for it, but look. You'll probably be falling upside-down.' I laugh nervously, and Adrian grins. 'It's time for your first aero launch,' he says. </p> <p>An aero launch is where the glider is hitched to a conventional powered plane (or 'tug') and towed into the air - in our case, to about 2,500ft, which is where the clouds begin. 'We never fly in cloud,' says Adrian, 'because it's too disorientating.' </p> <p>After a safety check, the plane drags us like a toboggan across the grass, and within seconds we are airborne. So far, it's like taking off in a normal plane, but then there is an ominous 'ping'. As Adrian releases the towing cable, the engine noise of the 'tug' fades and the buffeting from its propellers stops. We are silently, miraculously airborne, swooping along at terrific speed like a giant bird. </p> <p>The reason why gliders travel at such speed is gravity; they are, if you like, 'falling' at a very shallow angle, determined by the aircraft's aerodynamic design. For every foot of vertical drop, the glider travels dozens of feet forwards, and the pilot's job is to find an air current that will take it higher again. The best-known currents are 'thermals', formed where warm air rises off the earth and often marked by cumulus clouds. By reading cloud patterns, the pilot learns to judge where the best thermals are - and circles in them, slowly gaining height. Wind deflected by hills also provides uplift, as do the 'waves' of turbulent air caused by more distant mountains, allowing gliders to travel hundreds of miles cross-country without having to land. </p> <p>'There is tremendous energy up there,' says John Jeffries, the club's veteran flyer and instructor, who has been gliding since 1949. 'Think of all the people in the world scrabbling around for oil,' he says, 'when there's all this untapped energy in the sky, thousands and thousands of horsepower. A cloud contains two or three tons of water, all held up by nature's forces. That's what we're harnessing when we glide.' As we take off a second time - this time dragged into the air by a cable attached to a high-speed winch - the forces of nature are all too apparent. In a winch launch, the glider lurches violently across the airfield then ascends with an angle of trajectory more like a rocket, exerting a noticeable G-force. As the cable is released again, we soar free, then stabilise for a minute or two. </p> <p>'You have control,' Adrian announces, which means I am flying the plane alone. Cautiously, I execute a left turn, then a right turn, keeping the nose pointing slightly upwards so we don't lose precious height. The joystick is finely tuned and sensitive and I can feel turbulence through the controls as we enter a thermal. </p> <p>As my confidence builds, Adrian takes control and shows me what the plane can really do. First, he cranks it round in tight circles, gaining 200ft with a little help from the Downs. 'This is a wingover,' he says, dropping the left wing suddenly and pirouetting in a tight turn. My stomach clenches and I feel I will be thrown through the Perspex canopy. It is scarier and more exhilarating than any fairground ride. Traffic grind along the M1 below, the mansions, swimming pools and riding stables of millionaires appear like Ken and Barbie toys. It may be crazy, but gliding gives you a true perspective and a sublime detachment from life's banalities.

      "bodyText": "I was doing some shows in Bermuda for the Summer Jam. I went in search of the Bermuda Triangle, but found the Bermuda Circle instead. This is a competition featuring lots of local women dancing in grass thongs and bikinis to salsa and reggae-type music. I was staying at the Sonesta Beach Hotel and it was night-time. The women dance in large circles, someone throws coconuts into what looks like a hollowed-out calabash tree and the winner is the one who pots most. I hit a woman on the head by mistake. It was really embarrassing and apologised a lot. She was fine and said it happened quite often. I did win the coconut-throwing though, and my prize was to dance with the lovely women and to go on a tour of the island. The style of dancing was quite different from mine, but enjoyable. The most memorable part was dancing. One girl had really big feet; I stepped on them by mistake. Lots of other events were happening on the beach, such as karaoke and wet T-shirt competitions. I tried not to look at the wet T-shirt competitors but couldn't help myself. My rapping experience won me a pineapple and a teddy bear.

      "body": "<p> I have just returned from a holiday in the tranquil village of Kalkan in Turkey where temperatures last week reached a 40-year high of 60 degrees in the shade. That's 60 degrees centigrade, not farenheit. It wasn't like being in an oven; it was an oven. The breeze became a blow torch across the face. The Turkish government called a two-day national holiday for all office workers. Five million chickens fried to death and 10 people died - both old and young - through heat exhaustion and heart attacks. </p> <p>And what did the Brits in my hotel do? On the day it reached 60C (140 degrees farenheit), they lay on their sunbeds and soaked up the rays. They ignored the advice of the hotel staff, who looked on in amazement. 'These English,' said our hotel manager. 'Not even dogs would do this. Not even mad ones.' </p> <p>'We get so little sun in this country,' says Keith Betton, of Abta, 'that when we're on holiday we are looking for guaranteed sun and guaranteed tan and want to make the most of the time. We don't want to be couped up in an air-conditioned - or worse still un-air-conditioned - room when the sun is out. We spend too much time indoors at home as it is.' </p> <p>Although our British summer doesn't seemed to have blossomed so far this year, when the sun has come out the temperatures - in the 80s - have reached Mediterranean highs. With the impact of the greenhouse effect, are more extreme temperatures something holiday makers must expect in years to come? And what should they do to make the best of their holiday when the temperatures reach boiling point and above? Here are 10 tips to ensure that, whatever the weather, you get the most from your holidays. </p> <p> <strong> 1. Air conditioned?</strong> </p> <p> Make sure your hotel or villa is air-conditioned. Make this one of your key questions when you book your holiday. It is worth paying extra, and brochures should advise whether hotels or rooms are air-conditioned. Plus check if 'air-conditioned' means proper air-conditioning or just the availability of ceiling fans, which are not as effective in temperatures this high. You won't be able to sleep in conditions this hot if you don't have a properly air-conditioned room - and lack of sleep combined with dehydration bodes for an unhappy holiday. And don't think opening the windows at night will help either: think of the mosquitoes. </p> <p> <strong> 2. And baby comes, too?</strong> </p> <p> For the first time, I didn't take my son, Tom (now 20-months old) with me on holiday. He would have spent the whole trip in the hotel creche and seen little of the pretty village and beautiful country. Extreme conditions of heat and cold should be avoided if you have very young children or babies. If you have a young family choose destinations where the climate is temperate. France and Italy tend not to be as hot - year on year - than Greece and Turkey during the summer months of July and August. For the latter destinations choose seasons when the climate is cool and not humid - in the spring or autumn. May, June and September are lovely in Turkey and Greece, for example. There is no optimum temperature for travel with infants but if you need further information contact the British Airways Travel Clinic Hotline on 01276 685040). </p> <p> <strong> 3. Protection, protection, protection</strong> </p> <p> Protect yourself. Sounds obvious but we still don't. If you must go out to the shops or out in the sun, protect yourself. Take a sunhat - one that covers your head and the back of your neck. </p> <p>I have watched parents meticulously protect their children only to go out without any protection themselves. As for suncream, don't think of anything less than a Factor 10, even if you tan well. (Remember that just because you are not burning doesn't mean you are not seriously dehydrating.) For the nose and boney bits (if you have any) that stick out, use Factor 25. </p> <p> <strong> 4. Salt and water</strong> </p> <p> Drink lots of water. Don't drink coke or any drink with caffeine in it. Caffeine is a diuretic, which means you will pee more. Drink still, cool water or do as the locals do and drink the local teas. In Turkey, for example, apple tea - hot or cold - is very popular, cheap, offered in markets and shops, and quenches the thirst. You will also lose a lot of salt and iron. So take salt tablets. </p> <p>Those with low blood pressure are more prone to fainting in temperatures this high - as I am. In hot climates, you may not want to eat during the day but make sure you eat in the afternoon. In hot countries you will find the food more highly salted any way and you will need it. If you feel faint or dizzy get indoors to a cool area, preferably air-conditioned. Sit down. Ask for a glass of cool water with salt in it, and while you are waiting put your head between your legs. </p> <p> <strong> 5. Ask the localsS</strong> </p> <p> Ask for the day to day forecasts in the hotel. Most receptions will let you know if it is due to be an extra-hot day. And prepare for the day accordingly. Stay close to the hotel. Don't travel to a beach which has little or no shade. Book an excursion where the coaches are air-conditioned or visit local caves. And make sure you have drinking water with you and salt tablets at all times. </p> <p> <strong> 6. Doctor in the house</strong> </p> <p> I went with Tapestry Holidays (020 8235 7777), which I found to be an excellent tour operator. Most of their accommodation is air-conditioned and all the company's coaches were air-conditioned. Their brochure advises of the nearest doctors to each hotel and resort and most of their accommodation has doctors on call. This is important whether you have children or not. My hotel had a doctor in the house, and he was very busy the week I visited Turkey with Brits feeling faint in the heat. </p> <p>Most large hotels have doctors on call and smaller resorts have the addresses of doctors should you get heat stroke. Ask when you book your holiday at the travel agent about this service. It will prove invaluable and add peace of mind. </p> <p> <strong> 7. Have aircon will travel</strong> </p> <p> Taking excursions to get out of the heat is a good idea only if you have air-conditioned transport. </p> <p>What goes for air-conditioned rooms is doubly important while travelling. Choose a hire car with air-conditioning. Companies such as Holiday Autos (0870 5300400) offer this service. If the tour operator is offering excursions, make sure the coach is air-conditioned, and if you are travelling a long way make sure taxis are air-conditioned as well. </p> <p> <strong> 8. Forget the shade</strong> </p> <p> Holidaymakers believe if they stay under a sunshade they won't get heatstroke. Wrong. They will. You can get sunstroke if you are in the shade or not. When temperatures are this high, avoid being in the sun between 12noon and 4pm altogether. Have a long lunch and stay indoors. </p> <p> <strong> 9. How to have fun in the very hot sun</strong> </p> <p> What to do then when you're living in an oven? Staying in your room watching satellite TV is no option. When the going got tough in Turkey I booked a day out on a gulet where the sea breezes and temperatures were cooler. Not forgeting sunhat and sun tan cream. Day-long excursions that involve being in an air-conditioned coach and seeing the sites and avoiding the sun between noon and 4pm is a good idea. Any excursion that goes 'underground' (caves) is also good. </p> <p> <strong> 10. Pet hates</strong> </p> <p> Don't forget pets. If you are taking your ani mals overseas, don't leave them to bake in cars, or outdoors for too long. They can't take the heat either. </p> <p>\u0095 Sarah Tucker presents the Jazz Fm Travel Guide which starts on Thursday 3 August from 7-8pm on 102.2 fm and 100.4fm.

      "body": "<p>Stevie had broken his back in a car accident, and he had broken his knees in a variety of falls over the years, and was subject to petite and grand mal seizures; he was also addicted to Klonapin, an anticonvulsant, which he said he took to stave off seizures. Stevie often borrowed from loan sharks in the hotel: 10 bucks doubled to 20 in a couple of days with some sharks; with others, the rates were lower and a loan of 50 became 75. Stevie's mother sent him cash by Priority Mail, and she had set up a private toll-free 800 number for him to phone home, to save the charges he had long run up by calling collect; he phoned his mother every day, sometimes dozens of times a day, from a pay phone at the corner of Grand Street and the Bowery. He said he wanted to move back home with his parents but they wouldn't let him until he entered a detox programme and got clean.</p> <p>Stevie had cut a hole in the chicken wire in his room so his cat, Malaka, could come and go as he pleased, and the sheets on Stevie's bed were filthy and covered with cigarette burns, the remains of the times he had passed out while smoking. 'My mother has no idea how I'm living,' he said. 'What I'm going to do, I don't care if it costs me every cent I've got, I'm going to get a fucking camera, one of those disposable cameras, and I'm going to take pictures of the fucking hotel, and I'm going to send them to all my relatives.'</p> <p>That afternoon, when we got back from the soup kitchen, a man was waiting for Stevie in the hallway outside his room. The man was mangy, with a three-day beard and pony-tail drawn back on his head, and he stood close in on Stevie; he was one of the men I had seen loitering in front of the Providence day and night. Stevie had borrowed $3 from the man the day before for a pack of smokes. The man asked Stevie if he had the five bucks he now owed, the extra $2 amounting to interest on a day-long loan. Stevie pulled four crumpled singles from his pocket. The man counted the money. 'That's not the deal,' he said to Stevie. 'I'll give you the rest tomorrow,' Stevie said. 'That's not the deal,' the man said angrily, and he stepped closer to him. I quickly reached into my pocket for a dollar, but in the moment of threat, in the time it takes menace to become fact, a door behind us opened and the man who lived across the hall from Stevie held out a dollar - Stevie and his neighbour watched out for each other, Stevie later told me. The loan shark took the man's dollar and he took my dollar, then he stared hard at Stevie and he told him he'd better not fuck with him again.</p> <p>Monday night in the third week of October, the windows in the lobby had been cleaned for the first time ever, seemingly, and the light from the outside world was startlingly bright, the shining glass gleaming the reflection of the men back at themselves. There was a football game on TV but the room was mostly abandoned.</p> <p>Upstairs, the renovations continued apace: the bathroom on the fourth floor had been demolished, and steel caging had been added to join the tops of the boxes with the ceiling; the workers were rapidly nearing the main floor. The new owners were offering some of the permanent residents a cash settlement to leave the hotel and relinquish their claim to a room. It was common for the permanent residents to fall behind in their rent, some by as much as 500 days, and it was expensive and difficult for the owners to get the men evicted. The payout was, relatively speaking, a cheap solution. The amounts varied, but the maximum was $500, and Turk and some others had accepted the sum.</p> <p>By the end of the third week of October, there was no way to get into the lobby. The second floor of the Providence had been turned into a construction site and the ceiling echoed with carpenters banging nails and sawing wood. The piles of dry wall and lumber began to shrink as the lobby was changed from one room, with the television set in the corner and tables and chairs and cats arranged in no particular order. There were now to be two separate rooms. No one was quite sure what was going on. There were rumours that one room was going to be the lobby for men, the other for female residents; women, it was rumoured, were going to take over the main floor. The rates were going to go up, it was said - $12 a night, $15 dollars a night, no one was sure how much. The renovations were nearly complete, the new bathrooms and shower stalls put in place. Other hotels along the Bowery that had once been flophouses had been redone recently and the owners had started to rent by the night to tourists, some charging as much as $30 and $40.</p> <p>Late in the week, a small article buried in the bottom corner of a page in the middle of the New York Post carried the headline 'Bowery man held in fatal stabbing'. It was reported that the man who had been resident on the fourth floor of the Providence had been arrested. He had killed one man and seriously wounded two others, it was said, and he had been subdued by a security guard and an auxiliary cop after he had attacked a Chinatown shoe-store owner with a knife in broad daylight. He 'stabbed people who rubbed him the wrong way,' the article said. The shoe-store owner had looked at him in a manner he found offensive. One of the other stabbings had been caused when he grew angered at a man who spat on the pavement.</p> <p>The same day that the Post story ran, Stevie rose early and walked to his methadone clinic, then caught the train out to Long Island to visit his parents. He did his laundry, had a shower, and picked up a winter jacket and thermal underwear; his mother gave him boxes of cereal and a jar of peanut butter, and a few cans of soup; she slipped him $20. His mother was pushing the idea of him getting into a detox programme, Stevie said when he got back to the hotel that night. He said he was seriously considering the prospect of trying to quit methadone and the pharmacy-worth of pills he was hooked on. There was a place in the city called The Realization Center that he was thinking of trying.</p> <p>The next day, Stevie asked me if I would buy him a cup of coffee. We went to a bakery on the Bowery and Stevie chain-smoked cigarettes, his fingers yellowed with nicotine stains. He ate lemon rolls. He said he had walked by an automotive repair shop just off the Bowery that specialised in imports and, for a moment, contemplated going inside and applying for a job, but the place was a dump, he said, and he didn't want to risk using his tools and getting them damaged or stolen. His tools were worth $10,000, he said, and he could sell them but he never would; that was like a writer giving up his pen, an artist giving up his brushes. Stevie said he hadn't shot heroin that day or on Sunday, when his cat had spilled his dose of methadone. He said he had changed his mind that Sunday once he got to his dealer's room on the fifth floor of the hotel, despite the aching pain of withdrawal.</p> <p>Stevie rolled up the sleeve of his sweatshirt to prove that he hadn't shot heroin. His arms were ravaged with angry, open sores and needle marks. Seemingly unaware of the contradictions in his story, or what the scars on his emaciated arms told of his situation, he said he couldn't shoot heroin by himself. He had a lot of good veins left, he said, but he was afraid of getting an air bubble in the syringe that would go straight to his heart. He said he had to pay a friend - the junkie who lived across the hallway from him in the Providence - a couple of bucks to get him high. He walked out on to the Bowery, into the crisp autumn air, and he said he was depressed because he had gone to The Realization Center for an assessment that day and had been given the dual diagnoses of CD and MI - chemically dependent, mentally incompetent. He had been put in a holding room with people who couldn't even talk, with zombies. He feared he was going to be stuck in the Providence for the next 30 years. His biggest worry, the thing he cared about most in the world, was what to do with his cat if he entered a programme to try to get straight. 'If I could get my cat into my parents' house, I'd leave the Providence today,' he said.</p> <p>I took the train to Stevie's home on Long Island where the autumn leaves on the trees were red and puce and gold. The town was, as Stevie said, affluent, with quiet, winding streets, massive estates hidden behind steel gates and a Norman Rockwellian red-brick high school where Stevie had once been a student. Stevie's parents lived in a modest two-storey house in a less-wealthy quarter of the town. The living room was decorated with throw rugs and stuffed dolls and portraits of their daughter's graduation and wedding. Stevie's mother wore a cardigan and jeans and a pair of half-moon reading glasses strung on a necklace. His father, a retired investigator for the federal government, was a thin, softly spoken man, and he sat at the dining table smoking a pipe. They had given Stevie $120 a month, for years, they said; Stevie knew when his mother's social security cheque arrived, and he always came out from the Providence to collect the money. Stevie's mother said she always dreaded his visits. She also lived in dread that Stevie wouldn't arrive and she wouldn't know if he was alive or dead.</p> <p>Stevie had told me he was 37, but his parents said he was really 43. 'We're both about to turn 70,' his father said, 'and soon we'll be gone and Stevie is going to have to fend for himself.' Stevie's mother played a message from Stevie she had saved from their answering machine that morning. 'I'm taking $500 to leave my room,' he said on the recording. 'I'm going to leave the cat, because you promised me you would take the cat, but obviously you're not going to do that. It's obvious I'm going to die, so I might as well die on the streets. You know, $500 will be enough to give me a nice overdose.'</p> <p>Stevie's parents said that his troubles had been going on for years, and it had become impossible to clearly distinguish one event from another. They had made mistakes as parents, they said. 'We've apologised many times,' his mother said. 'We're not perfect people, or perfect parents. We all make mistakes. He was the first born, so he got more than the others. We're sorry, drop it, let it go, get on with your life.' Stevie's mother said that they had moved from a working-class neighbourhood to their new affluent town when Stevie was in grade school and that he had never fitted in with the more well-to-do kids. Stevie's father said he had suffered a nervous breakdown when Stevie was a teenager, and Stevie had started to steal his quaaludes. The heavy drinking and marijuana and LSD and, eventually, heroin came later. They had bought Stevie BMWs over the years and paid for his training as a mechanic; he had wrecked the cars and lost a string of jobs.

On their eldest daughter's wedding day, Stevie had turned up at the house high, and his mother refused to let him in.

Stevie hadn't been allowed to stay the night for the past few months; during his visits, his father, exhausted by the repeated accusations and demands, had begun to retreat to a room on the second floor and stayed until his son left. His mother said that tough love, which they tried to practise, following the advice of drug counsellors and others who had experience in such matters, was hard to live out.

      "bodyText": "Stevie had broken his back in a car accident, and he had broken his knees in a variety of falls over the years, and was subject to petite and grand mal seizures; he was also addicted to Klonapin, an anticonvulsant, which he said he took to stave off seizures. Stevie often borrowed from loan sharks in the hotel: 10 bucks doubled to 20 in a couple of days with some sharks; with others, the rates were lower and a loan of 50 became 75. Stevie's mother sent him cash by Priority Mail, and she had set up a private toll-free 800 number for him to phone home, to save the charges he had long run up by calling collect; he phoned his mother every day, sometimes dozens of times a day, from a pay phone at the corner of Grand Street and the Bowery. He said he wanted to move back home with his parents but they wouldn't let him until he entered a detox programme and got clean. Stevie had cut a hole in the chicken wire in his room so his cat, Malaka, could come and go as he pleased, and the sheets on Stevie's bed were filthy and covered with cigarette burns, the remains of the times he had passed out while smoking. 'My mother has no idea how I'm living,' he said. 'What I'm going to do, I don't care if it costs me every cent I've got, I'm going to get a fucking camera, one of those disposable cameras, and I'm going to take pictures of the fucking hotel, and I'm going to send them to all my relatives.' That afternoon, when we got back from the soup kitchen, a man was waiting for Stevie in the hallway outside his room. The man was mangy, with a three-day beard and pony-tail drawn back on his head, and he stood close in on Stevie; he was one of the men I had seen loitering in front of the Providence day and night. Stevie had borrowed $3 from the man the day before for a pack of smokes. The man asked Stevie if he had the five bucks he now owed, the extra $2 amounting to interest on a day-long loan. Stevie pulled four crumpled singles from his pocket. The man counted the money. 'That's not the deal,' he said to Stevie. 'I'll give you the rest tomorrow,' Stevie said. 'That's not the deal,' the man said angrily, and he stepped closer to him. I quickly reached into my pocket for a dollar, but in the moment of threat, in the time it takes menace to become fact, a door behind us opened and the man who lived across the hall from Stevie held out a dollar - Stevie and his neighbour watched out for each other, Stevie later told me. The loan shark took the man's dollar and he took my dollar, then he stared hard at Stevie and he told him he'd better not fuck with him again. Monday night in the third week of October, the windows in the lobby had been cleaned for the first time ever, seemingly, and the light from the outside world was startlingly bright, the shining glass gleaming the reflection of the men back at themselves. There was a football game on TV but the room was mostly abandoned. Upstairs, the renovations continued apace: the bathroom on the fourth floor had been demolished, and steel caging had been added to join the tops of the boxes with the ceiling; the workers were rapidly nearing the main floor. The new owners were offering some of the permanent residents a cash settlement to leave the hotel and relinquish their claim to a room. It was common for the permanent residents to fall behind in their rent, some by as much as 500 days, and it was expensive and difficult for the owners to get the men evicted. The payout was, relatively speaking, a cheap solution. The amounts varied, but the maximum was $500, and Turk and some others had accepted the sum. By the end of the third week of October, there was no way to get into the lobby. The second floor of the Providence had been turned into a construction site and the ceiling echoed with carpenters banging nails and sawing wood. The piles of dry wall and lumber began to shrink as the lobby was changed from one room, with the television set in the corner and tables and chairs and cats arranged in no particular order. There were now to be two separate rooms. No one was quite sure what was going on. There were rumours that one room was going to be the lobby for men, the other for female residents; women, it was rumoured, were going to take over the main floor. The rates were going to go up, it was said - $12 a night, $15 dollars a night, no one was sure how much. The renovations were nearly complete, the new bathrooms and shower stalls put in place. Other hotels along the Bowery that had once been flophouses had been redone recently and the owners had started to rent by the night to tourists, some charging as much as $30 and $40. Late in the week, a small article buried in the bottom corner of a page in the middle of the New York Post carried the headline 'Bowery man held in fatal stabbing'. It was reported that the man who had been resident on the fourth floor of the Providence had been arrested. He had killed one man and seriously wounded two others, it was said, and he had been subdued by a security guard and an auxiliary cop after he had attacked a Chinatown shoe-store owner with a knife in broad daylight. He 'stabbed people who rubbed him the wrong way,' the article said. The shoe-store owner had looked at him in a manner he found offensive. One of the other stabbings had been caused when he grew angered at a man who spat on the pavement. The same day that the Post story ran, Stevie rose early and walked to his methadone clinic, then caught the train out to Long Island to visit his parents. He did his laundry, had a shower, and picked up a winter jacket and thermal underwear; his mother gave him boxes of cereal and a jar of peanut butter, and a few cans of soup; she slipped him $20. His mother was pushing the idea of him getting into a detox programme, Stevie said when he got back to the hotel that night. He said he was seriously considering the prospect of trying to quit methadone and the pharmacy-worth of pills he was hooked on. There was a place in the city called The Realization Center that he was thinking of trying. The next day, Stevie asked me if I would buy him a cup of coffee. We went to a bakery on the Bowery and Stevie chain-smoked cigarettes, his fingers yellowed with nicotine stains. He ate lemon rolls. He said he had walked by an automotive repair shop just off the Bowery that specialised in imports and, for a moment, contemplated going inside and applying for a job, but the place was a dump, he said, and he didn't want to risk using his tools and getting them damaged or stolen. His tools were worth $10,000, he said, and he could sell them but he never would; that was like a writer giving up his pen, an artist giving up his brushes. Stevie said he hadn't shot heroin that day or on Sunday, when his cat had spilled his dose of methadone. He said he had changed his mind that Sunday once he got to his dealer's room on the fifth floor of the hotel, despite the aching pain of withdrawal. Stevie rolled up the sleeve of his sweatshirt to prove that he hadn't shot heroin. His arms were ravaged with angry, open sores and needle marks. Seemingly unaware of the contradictions in his story, or what the scars on his emaciated arms told of his situation, he said he couldn't shoot heroin by himself. He had a lot of good veins left, he said, but he was afraid of getting an air bubble in the syringe that would go straight to his heart. He said he had to pay a friend - the junkie who lived across the hallway from him in the Providence - a couple of bucks to get him high. He walked out on to the Bowery, into the crisp autumn air, and he said he was depressed because he had gone to The Realization Center for an assessment that day and had been given the dual diagnoses of CD and MI - chemically dependent, mentally incompetent. He had been put in a holding room with people who couldn't even talk, with zombies. He feared he was going to be stuck in the Providence for the next 30 years. His biggest worry, the thing he cared about most in the world, was what to do with his cat if he entered a programme to try to get straight. 'If I could get my cat into my parents' house, I'd leave the Providence today,' he said. I took the train to Stevie's home on Long Island where the autumn leaves on the trees were red and puce and gold. The town was, as Stevie said, affluent, with quiet, winding streets, massive estates hidden behind steel gates and a Norman Rockwellian red-brick high school where Stevie had once been a student. Stevie's parents lived in a modest two-storey house in a less-wealthy quarter of the town. The living room was decorated with throw rugs and stuffed dolls and portraits of their daughter's graduation and wedding. Stevie's mother wore a cardigan and jeans and a pair of half-moon reading glasses strung on a necklace. His father, a retired investigator for the federal government, was a thin, softly spoken man, and he sat at the dining table smoking a pipe. They had given Stevie $120 a month, for years, they said; Stevie knew when his mother's social security cheque arrived, and he always came out from the Providence to collect the money. Stevie's mother said she always dreaded his visits. She also lived in dread that Stevie wouldn't arrive and she wouldn't know if he was alive or dead. Stevie had told me he was 37, but his parents said he was really 43. 'We're both about to turn 70,' his father said, 'and soon we'll be gone and Stevie is going to have to fend for himself.' Stevie's mother played a message from Stevie she had saved from their answering machine that morning. 'I'm taking $500 to leave my room,' he said on the recording. 'I'm going to leave the cat, because you promised me you would take the cat, but obviously you're not going to do that. It's obvious I'm going to die, so I might as well die on the streets. You know, $500 will be enough to give me a nice overdose.' Stevie's parents said that his troubles had been going on for years, and it had become impossible to clearly distinguish one event from another. They had made mistakes as parents, they said. 'We've apologised many times,' his mother said. 'We're not perfect people, or perfect parents. We all make mistakes. He was the first born, so he got more than the others. We're sorry, drop it, let it go, get on with your life.' Stevie's mother said that they had moved from a working-class neighbourhood to their new affluent town when Stevie was in grade school and that he had never fitted in with the more well-to-do kids. Stevie's father said he had suffered a nervous breakdown when Stevie was a teenager, and Stevie had started to steal his quaaludes. The heavy drinking and marijuana and LSD and, eventually, heroin came later. They had bought Stevie BMWs over the years and paid for his training as a mechanic; he had wrecked the cars and lost a string of jobs. Stevie's father said that their other children, their daughters, had grown to hate the way Stevie's troubles affected the family. On their eldest daughter's wedding day, Stevie had turned up at the house high, and his mother refused to let him in. Stevie shot up on the front step; his mother watched from the kitchen window as he injected the needle and swore at them that he would be dead by the time they returned from the church.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p> In the last few weeks of the twentieth century Patrice Leconte was the most talked-about director in France. Every major newspaper ran articles and editorials devoted to him, praising him and deriding him. But the strange thing was, Leconte didn't have a film out at the time. </p> <p>The entire debacle was a mistake. What actually happened on 13 October 1999 was that Leconte finally put down on paper some of the thoughts that had been vexing him over the past few years. The French media, Leconte felt, was not supportive enough of the indigenous film industry.</p> <p>At the height of the New Wave French critics and film directors had been pretty much indistinguishable, most - like Francois Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard and Claude Chabrol - swapping the typewriter for a movie camera after serving an apprenticeship on pioneering intellectual film magazine Cahiers Du Cinema. </p> <p>Nowadays, thought Leconte, critics were simply acting as judge, jury and executioner, effectively killing French films before they could even reach their intended audience. In a private letter to the Society of Auteurs, Directors and Producers, Leconte said the issue was nearing crisis point and suggested a summit meeting. He also added a list of the publications whose reviews he felt were most damaging, but as a result of an administrative slip-up, his memo ended up being faxed to them as well. The next day, all hell broke loose. </p> <p>Was it really an accident or was he being disingenuous? And if it was an accident, was he really so surprised by the reaction? Actually, yes. Leconte, 52, a modest, wiry and conservatively dressed man, recalls the affair with detachment and perhaps a little irritation. 'I was surprised,' he says quietly, 'because of the scale of the whole thing. It just became huge. It blew up so much. When the critics - and that's a very small portion of specific, targeted critics - started writing pages and pages and pages I was shocked, really. I felt like saying, \"Do you realise what a state you're getting yourself into?\" Because, initially, all I wanted to say was \"Please, just be a tiny bit careful about what you write, and show your readers that you really love cinema.\" But it just blew up beyond belief. And it really annoyed me.' </p> <p>Interestingly, Leconte's new film is also about unlikely heroes. Starring Juliette Binoche, Daniel Auteuil and moonlighting film director Emir Kusturica, La Veuve De Saint Pierre takes place in 1850 and tells the story of an alcoholic sailor, Neel, who stabs a man to death in a drunken argument. The cause of the crime is beyond comprehension - in court, Neel recalls only that he cut the man open to settle an argument as to whether he was 'big or fat' - and the jury on the French-Canadian island of Saint Pierre sentences him to death. The problem is, there is no guillotine on the island, and even when one arrives in eight months time, there will be no one to act as executioner. </p> <p>As he awaits his appointment with the chopping block, Neel is placed in the care of the Captain (Auteuil), whose wife, Madame La (Binoche), pleads for special allowances for the condemned man. Over the next eight months Neel is totally rehabilitated; he renounces drinking, carries out odd jobs for local widows and risks his life to save the town caf\u00e9 and its owner. </p> <p> As the execution date looms, the islanders begin to realise that the man who will die is not the same man who committed the crime and so they strive to stop the killing. Based on a true story, La Veuve is a surprisingly emotional and moving film from a director who usually presents his sharp intelligence in much more guarded terms, as in his breakthrough film, the Hitchcockian thriller, Monsieur Hire, made in 1989. </p> <p>'I totally agree,' he says. 'But I knew that I had this desire to shoot a big melodrama, a film that would be a really novelistic film. Tragic. But obviously on condition that it would be with dignity, that it would be a very beautiful story. </p> <p>'So, paradoxically, I was actually waiting for that kind of project. It wasn't that I was simply indulging myself by doing something different yet again. I wasn't chasing around after that. But I knew that, within me, there was this taste for the beautiful, sad things.' </p> <p>That said, there's an extraordinary sense of wit underlying this apparently dark, morbid story. The idea, for example, that a convicted killer can charm the whole neighbourhood to become something of a local hero. And there's also the idea that, for all her good intentions, the socially conscious Madame La is simply pushing matters towards their obvious conclusion, while actually making things worse for herself and her doting husband. </p> <p>To call it a black comedy would be going too far, but there's certainly something at odds with the ravishing, dark mood. 'I'm not consciously doing that,' says Leconte 'but it could be a reflection of my second nature. It's not necessarily humour you're seeing, but there is a kind of irony that comes through. And it's simply because I am incapable - violently incapable - of taking myself seriously. But it's also because in making this film - which I deeply wanted to do, was passionate about and which really moved me - I didn't want to risk becoming too heavy.' </p> <p>Likewise, the film doesn't seem so concerned with history itself. Like Leconte's 1995 film Ridicule - another period film, which concerned itself with the social intrigues of the court of Louis XVI - La Veuve seems less interested in history than the conventions within it. 'You could say that,' he shrugs, 'but what interests me more is the customs of the people. I'm more interested in people as human beings, so obviously their behaviour is more interesting to me. But it's true that I haven't really got the soul of a historian. I was a very bad student in history at school and I haven't really changed much on that score. And so when I make a film like La Veuve , I apply my own sensitivity as a man of today. I didn't make the film by projecting myself into the past.' </p> <p>After the furore about French critics and French film, how was La Veuve treated in its homeland? 'Basically, they pissed me off by writing things that were nothing. The specific targeted papers just wrote stuff that was very tepid. Neither good nor bad. It was the worst attitude, actually. But at the same time, I don't regret having caused such a stink. It wasn't a bad thing because it had a positive outcome; on the first of January - the first day of the new century - I made a resolution. I swore to myself that never again would I read reviews, either of my films or of the others. And for a very simple reason: when you read a good review it makes you feel good for a little while, but when you read a bad review, the damage can be very harmful.' </p> <p>So it's unlikely that Leconte will be reading any press on his new film, Felix And Lola, which he shot almost back-to-back with La Veuve - and with good reason. </p> <p>'I often shoot films straight away because I like to be in the middle of a shoot while the previous film is coming out,' he says. 'I like to keep myself busy, otherwise if you're not, you're at home, waiting for the figures to come in.' </p> <p>He sighs. </p> <p>'It's just too stressful!' </p> <p><strong> Tales of obsession: three of Leconte's finest </strong></p> <p><strong> Hairdresser's Husband (1990) </strong><br> An entrancing and deeply erotic love story between an enigmatic hairdresser and a middle-aged man . The plot is negligible, revolving around their frenetic sex life and strange behaviour.

At the height of the New Wave French critics and film directors had been pretty much indistinguishable, most - like Francois Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard and Claude Chabrol - swapping the typewriter for a movie camera after serving an apprenticeship on pioneering intellectual film magazine Cahiers Du Cinema. Nowadays, thought Leconte, critics were simply acting as judge, jury and executioner, effectively killing French films before they could even reach their intended audience. In a private letter to the Society of Auteurs, Directors and Producers, Leconte said the issue was nearing crisis point and suggested a summit meeting. He also added a list of the publications whose reviews he felt were most damaging, but as a result of an administrative slip-up, his memo ended up being faxed to them as well. The next day, all hell broke loose. Was it really an accident or was he being disingenuous? And if it was an accident, was he really so surprised by the reaction? Actually, yes. Leconte, 52, a modest, wiry and conservatively dressed man, recalls the affair with detachment and perhaps a little irritation. 'I was surprised,' he says quietly, 'because of the scale of the whole thing. It just became huge. It blew up so much. When the critics - and that's a very small portion of specific, targeted critics - started writing pages and pages and pages I was shocked, really. I felt like saying, \"Do you realise what a state you're getting yourself into?\" Because, initially, all I wanted to say was \"Please, just be a tiny bit careful about what you write, and show your readers that you really love cinema.\" But it just blew up beyond belief. And it really annoyed me.' Interestingly, Leconte's new film is also about unlikely heroes. Starring Juliette Binoche, Daniel Auteuil and moonlighting film director Emir Kusturica, La Veuve De Saint Pierre takes place in 1850 and tells the story of an alcoholic sailor, Neel, who stabs a man to death in a drunken argument. The cause of the crime is beyond comprehension - in court, Neel recalls only that he cut the man open to settle an argument as to whether he was 'big or fat' - and the jury on the French-Canadian island of Saint Pierre sentences him to death. The problem is, there is no guillotine on the island, and even when one arrives in eight months time, there will be no one to act as executioner. As he awaits his appointment with the chopping block, Neel is placed in the care of the Captain (Auteuil), whose wife, Madame La (Binoche), pleads for special allowances for the condemned man. Over the next eight months Neel is totally rehabilitated; he renounces drinking, carries out odd jobs for local widows and risks his life to save the town caf\u00e9 and its owner. As the execution date looms, the islanders begin to realise that the man who will die is not the same man who committed the crime and so they strive to stop the killing. Based on a true story, La Veuve is a surprisingly emotional and moving film from a director who usually presents his sharp intelligence in much more guarded terms, as in his breakthrough film, the Hitchcockian thriller, Monsieur Hire, made in 1989. 'I totally agree,' he says. 'But I knew that I had this desire to shoot a big melodrama, a film that would be a really novelistic film. Tragic. But obviously on condition that it would be with dignity, that it would be a very beautiful story. 'So, paradoxically, I was actually waiting for that kind of project. It wasn't that I was simply indulging myself by doing something different yet again. I wasn't chasing around after that. But I knew that, within me, there was this taste for the beautiful, sad things.' That said, there's an extraordinary sense of wit underlying this apparently dark, morbid story. The idea, for example, that a convicted killer can charm the whole neighbourhood to become something of a local hero. And there's also the idea that, for all her good intentions, the socially conscious Madame La is simply pushing matters towards their obvious conclusion, while actually making things worse for herself and her doting husband. To call it a black comedy would be going too far, but there's certainly something at odds with the ravishing, dark mood. 'I'm not consciously doing that,' says Leconte 'but it could be a reflection of my second nature. It's not necessarily humour you're seeing, but there is a kind of irony that comes through. And it's simply because I am incapable - violently incapable - of taking myself seriously. But it's also because in making this film - which I deeply wanted to do, was passionate about and which really moved me - I didn't want to risk becoming too heavy.' Likewise, the film doesn't seem so concerned with history itself. Like Leconte's 1995 film Ridicule - another period film, which concerned itself with the social intrigues of the court of Louis XVI - La Veuve seems less interested in history than the conventions within it. 'You could say that,' he shrugs, 'but what interests me more is the customs of the people. I'm more interested in people as human beings, so obviously their behaviour is more interesting to me. But it's true that I haven't really got the soul of a historian. I was a very bad student in history at school and I haven't really changed much on that score. And so when I make a film like La Veuve , I apply my own sensitivity as a man of today. I didn't make the film by projecting myself into the past.' After the furore about French critics and French film, how was La Veuve treated in its homeland? 'Basically, they pissed me off by writing things that were nothing. The specific targeted papers just wrote stuff that was very tepid. Neither good nor bad. It was the worst attitude, actually. But at the same time, I don't regret having caused such a stink. It wasn't a bad thing because it had a positive outcome; on the first of January - the first day of the new century - I made a resolution. I swore to myself that never again would I read reviews, either of my films or of the others. And for a very simple reason: when you read a good review it makes you feel good for a little while, but when you read a bad review, the damage can be very harmful.' So it's unlikely that Leconte will be reading any press on his new film, Felix And Lola, which he shot almost back-to-back with La Veuve - and with good reason. 'I often shoot films straight away because I like to be in the middle of a shoot while the previous film is coming out,' he says. 'I like to keep myself busy, otherwise if you're not, you're at home, waiting for the figures to come in.' He sighs. 'It's just too stressful!' Tales of obsession: three of Leconte's finest Hairdresser's Husband (1990) An entrancing and deeply erotic love story between an enigmatic hairdresser and a middle-aged man . The plot is negligible, revolving around their frenetic sex life and strange behaviour. But the pleasure is all in the details. Le Parfum d'Yvonne (1994) Set during a heady summer on Lake Geneva in the Fifties. A young writer seeks refuge from military service and the Algerian War, falling in love with a cool beauty and embarking on a sensual journey of self discovery. Ridicule (1996) Trenchant comedy set during the reign of Louis XVI. An idealistic baron goes to court to win funds for a drainage system to benefit his peasants. There he discovers a gift for courtly humour and fame which threatens to corrupt him. \u0095 La Veuve De Saint Pierre opens 4 August",

The League of Gentlemen (1960, PG, VCI, VHS/Rental) One of the best British heist movies, this splendid comedy-thriller stars Jack Hawkins as a disgruntled ex-colonel who recruits a mess of disreputable cashiered officers to stage a military-style bank robbery. The witty script is co-authored by Bryan Forbes who also performs in an expert cast that includes Nigel Patrick, Richard Attenborough and Roger Livesey.",

Just occasionally, though, they warrant a little pat on the back and in recent times, two of their less obvious choices show signs of bearing fruit. </p> <p>There is Michael Vaughan. In the 1999 season he averaged a paltry 27 for Yorkshire yet was whisked off to South Africa and the signs are that they have unearthed a potential Test player for years to come (although he has only scored one half-century so far and that was in the 'dubious' Centurion Test match). </p> <p>This summer they have plucked out Somerset's Marcus Trescothick (albeit after injuries to original one-day squad memebers) and they were rewarded by several sterling innings in the NatWest Series that suggest he is at home at this level. Trescothick, aged 24, a year younger than Vaughan, did not have a massive weight of runs to support his claims. And his career average at the start of this season - 29 - was modest by county, let alone international standards. Impressed by what they saw in those one dayers, Trescothick makes his Test debut at Old Trafford on Thursday. </p> <p>Both Vaughan and Trescothick revealed their pedigree playing for England Under-19s. Six years ago the rectitude of Vaughan's technique stood out, while the easy power of Trescothick's strokeplay often took the breath away. </p> <p>Trescothick, who played for the Under-19s for three years and scored more than a 1000 runs, a total exceeded only by John Crawley. It may be that he played too much Under-19 cricket. The debate over which should take priority - representing the Under-19s or playing cricket in the County Championship - still continues. </p> <p>The English authorities think the representative match should hold sway, a different view to the Australians, who recently flew one of their Under-19 players back home from the World Cup in Sri Lanka to play a state match. The Aussies are wary of pampering their youngsters. Mind you, Trescothick has never been a swaggerer; he respects the game, loves it even, and his gentle humour and self-effacing manner have made him popular wherever he's played. </p> <p>Until he was 19 Trescothick excelled at every level, despite always being a little podgy. His diet too often comprised of sausages and Mars bars, but it didn't seem to matter much because the runs kept flowing. Only recently has he recognised the need to be as fit and mobile as possible. </p> <p>From the time he pottered along to the Bath cricket school of Peter Wight, the former Somerset player and umpire, for weekly sessions at the age of 11, his only obvious setback was that he was omitted from the West's Under-15s tour of the Caribbean on the grounds that he was not fit enough. </p> <p>In 1994, at the age of 18, he played some blistering innings for Somerset as an opener before he was taken away by the Under-19s. Until last summer he was never as productive again. There would be the odd remarkable innings in between the failures (one of them was in the second team in 1997 when he made 322 in pursuit of 612 for victory - he was run out trying to retain the strike seven runs short of the target). Even in 1999, when he was made vice-captain of Somerset, he was inconsistent and the odd brilliant innings was interspersed with an infuriating failure often brought about by a wayward flirtation outside his off-stump. </p> <p>Then on September 3 he played his best innings yet. It was against Glamorgan at Taunton on the fastest pitch seen in this country for years. In the second innings he cracked 167 while no other player surpassed 50 - ensuring an easy Somerset victory. Jacques Kallis, no slouch, was repeatedly pulled over the mid-wicket boundary. A bewildered Steve Watkin saw one of his deliveries dispatched back over his head into the graveyard. An awesome innings and a timely one as well. For sitting on the balcony was Duncan Fletcher, fulfiling his role as Glamorgan's coach before moving on to the England job. 'Who is this man?' he murmured. </p> <p>On that innings alone Fletcher insisted that Trescothick should go on the A tour. He was not a spectacular success on the trip to Bangladesh and New Zealand but the whole experience must have toughened him up. For Trescothick relies on more than sheer natural talent now. He's fitter and more dedicated than he has ever been and they have noticed the gradual change at Somerset. He spent all winter in the indoor nets anxious to hone his game, which he did to good effect; the face of the bat is not so open now, which has led to much greater consistency this year. </p> <p>At Southgate, where Somerset were bundled out for 58 in the NatWest, he was churning out shuttle runs post-dismissal. Last week he stayed behind in the nets with specific preparations for the Test to come, before packing his bags for Durham and a Championship match. </p> <p>There have been well-wishers everywhere in the West country this week. They sent him off a little nervously though. They remember what happened to Mark Lathwell seven years ago, another special talent who joined the desperate and disparate side that faced the Australians. </p> <p>At Keynsham in particular they will be anxiously monitoring his debut. Trescothick's parents are still stalwarts at Keynsham CC and Marcus has never forgotten his old club. Every year since he became a pro he has tried to play at least once for them. Although in light of Duncan Fletcher's intentions to withdraw contracted players from the Championship run-in in September, I'm none too sure when Somerset, let alone Keynsham, will see him again.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The weakest idea of the year? The most predictable? Or just the most redundant? On paper, Scary Movie is all these things. Considering that the whole point of the Scream trilogy was that it played on the absurdity of horror clich\u00e9s, to attempt a parody seems surreally pointless. </p> <p>US critics agree. 'Hasn't it all been done to death?' sighed a despairing New York Times . The only thing Scary Movie seemed to have going for it was that the cumbersome titles of the two scripts melded together to make the film - Last Summer I Screamed Because Friday the 13th Fell on Halloween and Scream if I Know What You Did Last Halloween - had been dumped in favour of what was Scream 's original name. </p> <p>But none of that troubled the American public - or at least the teenagers - who rushed to see the film. Scary Movie had the second-best opening weekend of the summer after Mission: Impossible 2 . And since its budget was around a tenth of MI:2's - or slightly less than Tom Cruise's salary - it instantly went into profit. </p> <p>So what's going on here? Not only has the Scream cycle long since worn out its novelty, but making jokes about those movies is hardly less stale, since it has already been done on a dozen TV shows. One of the other films Scary Movie sends up is the Blair Witch Project : when the film was being written that must have seemed like a topical reference; now, it's a sketch that Hale and Pace would reject as past its sell-by date. </p> <p>The prime of the parody genre was even longer ago, before it was worn out by Leslie Neilsen's reluctance to turn down work after Airplane revived his career. And it turns out that the Scream If I Know What You Did Last Halloween script was the work of the men who wrote Spy Hard (1996), one of the later, lesser Neilsen movies. </p> <p> Last Summer I Screamed Because Friday the 13th Fell on Halloween, meanwhile, was written by Shawn and Marlon Wayans, previously responsible for Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood (1996), a spoof of the brief outbreak of ghetto reality movies. </p> <p>When Miramax bought both scripts, it was the Wayans brothers along with their friends Buddy Johnson and Phil Beauman who were given the responsibility of turning them into something, if not coherent ('It's not like plot was the overriding thing,' says Miramax's Bob Weinstein), then at least packed with the requisite number of gags per minute. </p> <p>If the writers had no great track record, neither did the stars. Not unless you count Shannon Elizabeth - she played the eastern European girl in American Pie - as famous. Or would pay money to see a couple of min utes work from former Baywatch girl/Dennis Rodman's ex-wife Carmen Electra, who does the Drew Barrymore/celebrity first victim role. </p> <p>All of which explains why the pundits were so genuinely taken aback when Scary Movie accelerated past long anticipated, star-powered blockbusters like The Patriot . What was going on? You can find the answer in the New York Times , but not in the film review. Beneath it there is a brief explanation of why the film merits its 'R' certificate: 'It consists almost entirely of vulgar sexual references, gory violence, depictions of drug use and references to nasal, genital and lower-intestinal bodily functions.' </p> <p>It's surprising the distributors didn't blow that up and stick it on the poster. In fact, there has been some bafflement about how the film managed to pick up an R, rather than the more commercially damaging NC-17. One answer seems to be that some of the male genitalia and pubic hair in the film are fake and therefore somehow acceptable. The other is that these days, you can get away with most things as long as the film is a comedy. </p> <p>As far as anyone has been able to count, Scary Movie has set new records for the range of naked body parts on show in a mainstream movie. So forget about its in-jokes about Scream and The Sixth Sense: the reason Scary Movie has done so well is that it is this summer's big gross-out movie. After There's Something About Mary and American Pie, everyone was expecting that there would be at least one supremely tasteless hit over the holiday season. Most thought it would be Bobby and Peter Farrelly's Me, Myself &amp; Irene, which had an obvious headstart with Jim Carrey in the lead role(s). And if not that, then possibly Road Trip, which features headline-grabbing MTV shock king Tom Green. </p> <p>Instead, following the rule of brothers that has given us the Farrellys and the Weitzes (the writers of American Pie), it was the Wayans - who also star in the film - who came out on top. There is nothing complicated about what they have done: girls in bikinis, sperm, snot and old women getting run over by pianos - it's a simple formula for success. They've just done more of it, pushed the boundaries that little bit further. </p> <p>Having a multi-racial cast (the Wayans are black), and some jokes aimed directly at a black audience probably didn't hurt either. What's interesting about Scary Movie is that it forgoes the romance and hints of decency and human warmth that Something About Mary and American Pie used to balance the vomit and sperm gags. Even South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone have insisted there is an 'overlying sweetness' to their work. </p> <p>But Scary Movie doesn't do that - it couldn't really, given the spoof genre. This has meant that a couple of US critics have put themselves in the absurd position of citing the Farrellys - last seen as evidence of Western civilisation on its very last legs - as representing a kinder, more decent age (last year, perhaps?). </p> <p>The problem with the Wayans, Salon on-line magazine suggested, is that they don't come across like naughty schoolboys. Which has to be the first time this has been an insult. However, the effect of Scary Movie will be that the MPAA (the US ratings board) will have a tough time with next year's batch of comedies: somewhere out there a studio executive is surely screaming 'Old women's breasts are so over! Give me more testicles!' </p> <p> The film is a vindication of sorts for the sprawling Wayans family. In 1990 Damon Wayans - not in this film - was sharing star billing with Bruce Willis in The Last Boy Scout . But since the heyday of influential sketch show In Living Color, the Wayans have been a touch left behind by ex-colleagues Jim Carrey and Jennifer Lopez. Recently, Shawn and Marlon's sitcom - the imaginatively titled Wayans Bros - was cancelled, a move the network might be regretting now. Scary Movie was directed by eldest brother Keenan Ivory, whose career started with the blaxploitation spoof I'm Going To Git You Sucka in 1988, but who has only directed one film since. Now he is responsible for what will be the most commercially successful movie yet made by a black American. </p> <p>The other siblings who have come out looking clever are the Weinsteins. On the one hand, they soothe Hollywood's bourgeois conscience: sweeping through the Oscars every year, protecting the business from accusations of rampant philistinism with movies like Shakespeare In Love . On the other, their Dimension Pictures wing cranks out horror and teen hits at (comparatively) rock bottom prices. </p> <p>Other moguls might have felt more protective about their cash cow series of films: Bob Weinstein decided that if someone was going to make money spoofing the Scream series, it might as well be Dimension. And thus it chalked up another huge hit, made for under $20 million. </p> <p>The bad news? Since Scary Movie truly was the most predictable film of the year, it is no surprise that the competing I Know What You Screamed Last Semester , with the unlikely pairing of Tom Arnold and rapper Coolio, is already on the way. Not to mention Scary Movie 2. Resign yourselves: there is no end in sight... </p> <p><strong>Blazing a trail from risque to rude</strong></p> <p>Hard to imagine, but on-screen flatulence was a big deal 25 years ago.

      "bodyText": "The weakest idea of the year? The most predictable? Or just the most redundant? On paper, Scary Movie is all these things. Considering that the whole point of the Scream trilogy was that it played on the absurdity of horror clich\u00e9s, to attempt a parody seems surreally pointless. US critics agree. 'Hasn't it all been done to death?' sighed a despairing New York Times . The only thing Scary Movie seemed to have going for it was that the cumbersome titles of the two scripts melded together to make the film - Last Summer I Screamed Because Friday the 13th Fell on Halloween and Scream if I Know What You Did Last Halloween - had been dumped in favour of what was Scream 's original name. But none of that troubled the American public - or at least the teenagers - who rushed to see the film. Scary Movie had the second-best opening weekend of the summer after Mission: Impossible 2 . And since its budget was around a tenth of MI:2's - or slightly less than Tom Cruise's salary - it instantly went into profit. So what's going on here? Not only has the Scream cycle long since worn out its novelty, but making jokes about those movies is hardly less stale, since it has already been done on a dozen TV shows. One of the other films Scary Movie sends up is the Blair Witch Project : when the film was being written that must have seemed like a topical reference; now, it's a sketch that Hale and Pace would reject as past its sell-by date. The prime of the parody genre was even longer ago, before it was worn out by Leslie Neilsen's reluctance to turn down work after Airplane revived his career. And it turns out that the Scream If I Know What You Did Last Halloween script was the work of the men who wrote Spy Hard (1996), one of the later, lesser Neilsen movies. Last Summer I Screamed Because Friday the 13th Fell on Halloween, meanwhile, was written by Shawn and Marlon Wayans, previously responsible for Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood (1996), a spoof of the brief outbreak of ghetto reality movies. When Miramax bought both scripts, it was the Wayans brothers along with their friends Buddy Johnson and Phil Beauman who were given the responsibility of turning them into something, if not coherent ('It's not like plot was the overriding thing,' says Miramax's Bob Weinstein), then at least packed with the requisite number of gags per minute. If the writers had no great track record, neither did the stars. Not unless you count Shannon Elizabeth - she played the eastern European girl in American Pie - as famous. Or would pay money to see a couple of min utes work from former Baywatch girl/Dennis Rodman's ex-wife Carmen Electra, who does the Drew Barrymore/celebrity first victim role. All of which explains why the pundits were so genuinely taken aback when Scary Movie accelerated past long anticipated, star-powered blockbusters like The Patriot . What was going on? You can find the answer in the New York Times , but not in the film review. Beneath it there is a brief explanation of why the film merits its 'R' certificate: 'It consists almost entirely of vulgar sexual references, gory violence, depictions of drug use and references to nasal, genital and lower-intestinal bodily functions.' It's surprising the distributors didn't blow that up and stick it on the poster. In fact, there has been some bafflement about how the film managed to pick up an R, rather than the more commercially damaging NC-17. One answer seems to be that some of the male genitalia and pubic hair in the film are fake and therefore somehow acceptable. The other is that these days, you can get away with most things as long as the film is a comedy. As far as anyone has been able to count, Scary Movie has set new records for the range of naked body parts on show in a mainstream movie. So forget about its in-jokes about Scream and The Sixth Sense: the reason Scary Movie has done so well is that it is this summer's big gross-out movie. After There's Something About Mary and American Pie, everyone was expecting that there would be at least one supremely tasteless hit over the holiday season. Most thought it would be Bobby and Peter Farrelly's Me, Myself &amp; Irene, which had an obvious headstart with Jim Carrey in the lead role(s). And if not that, then possibly Road Trip, which features headline-grabbing MTV shock king Tom Green. Instead, following the rule of brothers that has given us the Farrellys and the Weitzes (the writers of American Pie), it was the Wayans - who also star in the film - who came out on top. There is nothing complicated about what they have done: girls in bikinis, sperm, snot and old women getting run over by pianos - it's a simple formula for success. They've just done more of it, pushed the boundaries that little bit further. Having a multi-racial cast (the Wayans are black), and some jokes aimed directly at a black audience probably didn't hurt either. What's interesting about Scary Movie is that it forgoes the romance and hints of decency and human warmth that Something About Mary and American Pie used to balance the vomit and sperm gags. Even South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone have insisted there is an 'overlying sweetness' to their work. But Scary Movie doesn't do that - it couldn't really, given the spoof genre. This has meant that a couple of US critics have put themselves in the absurd position of citing the Farrellys - last seen as evidence of Western civilisation on its very last legs - as representing a kinder, more decent age (last year, perhaps?). The problem with the Wayans, Salon on-line magazine suggested, is that they don't come across like naughty schoolboys. Which has to be the first time this has been an insult. However, the effect of Scary Movie will be that the MPAA (the US ratings board) will have a tough time with next year's batch of comedies: somewhere out there a studio executive is surely screaming 'Old women's breasts are so over! Give me more testicles!' The film is a vindication of sorts for the sprawling Wayans family. In 1990 Damon Wayans - not in this film - was sharing star billing with Bruce Willis in The Last Boy Scout . But since the heyday of influential sketch show In Living Color, the Wayans have been a touch left behind by ex-colleagues Jim Carrey and Jennifer Lopez. Recently, Shawn and Marlon's sitcom - the imaginatively titled Wayans Bros - was cancelled, a move the network might be regretting now. Scary Movie was directed by eldest brother Keenan Ivory, whose career started with the blaxploitation spoof I'm Going To Git You Sucka in 1988, but who has only directed one film since. Now he is responsible for what will be the most commercially successful movie yet made by a black American. The other siblings who have come out looking clever are the Weinsteins. On the one hand, they soothe Hollywood's bourgeois conscience: sweeping through the Oscars every year, protecting the business from accusations of rampant philistinism with movies like Shakespeare In Love . On the other, their Dimension Pictures wing cranks out horror and teen hits at (comparatively) rock bottom prices. Other moguls might have felt more protective about their cash cow series of films: Bob Weinstein decided that if someone was going to make money spoofing the Scream series, it might as well be Dimension. And thus it chalked up another huge hit, made for under $20 million. The bad news? Since Scary Movie truly was the most predictable film of the year, it is no surprise that the competing I Know What You Screamed Last Semester , with the unlikely pairing of Tom Arnold and rapper Coolio, is already on the way. Not to mention Scary Movie 2. Resign yourselves: there is no end in sight... Blazing a trail from risque to rude Hard to imagine, but on-screen flatulence was a big deal 25 years ago. The infamous cowboys 'n' campfire scene in Blazing Saddles was as gross as it got. 'It was so outside the bounds of manners that no one had ever put it on screen before,' recalls co-writer Andrew Bergman. 'It was kind of historic.' It was also very funny. Ditto Woody Allen dressing as a giant sperm in Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex But Were Afraid to Ask . Arthouse provocateur John Waters claimed he was challenging complacent moviegoers when Divine snacked on real dog excrement in Pink Flamingos, but as the boundaries of taste were pushed back, the temptations of fraternity house humour proved too much. In the Eighties, the success of Animal House and Porky's relied on an unsophisticated mix of Carry On and Mad magazine antics, inspiring many imitators. Now, anything goes.

And these films can look forward to a long and profitable life in video rental shops.

'Successful prosecutions have been carried out on several offshore corporations that have been involved in fraud and there has been full co-operation with the UK, the USA, Belgium, Switzerland and Canada in bringing criminals to justice.' He added: 'While Rhino also claimed that we do not have stringent obscenity laws, they are now painfully aware of the inaccuracy of their information... Effectively, Rhino Corporation's websites are no longer operational and their business licence will be revoked under our laws pending further legal action.' Trueheart Smith, the island's police commissioner, said: 'We are very, very glad to see the back of these people. They are not the type of people we want on the island and we hope the British authorities will consider taking action against them.' stuart.millar@observer.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>Karl Faberg\u00e9 himself could not have designed anything so exquisite as the punnets of pale pink currants I found in one of the larger supermarkets last summer. Slightly tart on the tongue, the flawless, transparent bubbles hung from thin stems like costume jewellery at a ball. I have never seen such delicate beauty in anything edible. Since late June, I have lain in wait for their short season, roaming the aisles for a sight of these precious fruits, but this year they are gone. (There is a stalking currants joke in there somewhere, but I will spare you.) Perhaps they were considered too beautiful to eat. </p> <p>I had hoped to re-create a fruit salad that was as perfect to look at as it had been to eat - an understated jumble of blackberries and pink currants that followed a cold salmon lunch. It was cheap, too, with the berries coming from the brambles that found their way into my garden from next door. But second best was also good - a bowl of blackberries and white currants that I scattered around a tiny mound of soft, white fromage frais. A perfect plate to cheer up this mean little summer. </p> <p>The midnight-coloured fruits - blackberries, plump dessert blackcurrants and Dorset blueberries - make a mysterious and sumptuous salad. Drop some claret-coloured loganberries or overripe raspberries in there as well, and you have an impossibly luxurious dessert. It would be a crime to smother it with cream, and sacrilege even to pass the sugar shaker, but doubtless there are those who would. Those who share a fondness for clean, bright tastes may like to scatter their salad with redcurrants, too. </p> <p>A decade or more ago, I ate a bowl of fruit that was to change the way I thought about summer puddings. Until then it had been a case of the more the merrier, and cut up into a million small pieces. A fruit salad wasn't worth eating unless it looked like a Jackson Pollock. We had driven down to Shipdham Place, a country house hotel near Dereham in Norfolk, where Vanessa Lam (now cooking at Ransome's Dock in south-west London) produced vast white porcelain bowls of perfectly ripe, pale green melon and wild blackberries - it remains one of the most memorable desserts I have ever eaten. The simplicity and perfection of the pale green melon dripping with sweet juice and cut into large chunks and the sharpness of the local berries threw a whole new light on to the genre. It is worth remembering that I was brought up on tinned fruit cocktail and Carnation milk. </p> <p>The idea that two or three fruits will, if chosen with a little thought and cut not too small, make a more interesting end to a meal than one where you throw in everything in season has remained with me. I get a real buzz from getting such marriages right. You don't necessarily need something sweet with something sharp; you could choose two sweet fruits - mango and pawpaw, say - and spike them with a sharp juice, such as lime. Alternatively, two piercing fruits such as grapefruit and redcurrants can be softened by the addition of something sweet like an amber-fleshed melon. OK, so even David Beckham could work that one out, but then look how often a fruit salad is put together with no thought for anything other than what just happens to be in the fruit bowl at the time. </p> <p>Ripeness is all, and it is worth spending time bringing peaches and apricots along the road to perfection ourselves. A warm windowsill and a daily sniff will do. You will smell them when they are ripe. Berries, though, do not ripen once they are picked, so we must be fussy in the shops. Generally, the darker the berry the deeper its flavour will be, yet to confuse the issue I bought some golden-pink raspberries the other day that at first looked like something to avoid, yet when I picked them up and sniffed them I got a promising scent of roses. They turned out to be superb, like berries you might pick from your own garden. </p> <p>Apple does not belong in a mixture of summer fruit. The crunch seems inappropriate amongst sumptuous redcurrants and ripe berries. Wait till autumn and then toss them with fresh walnuts and lemon juice. Instead, go for the deep scarlet soft fruit whose season is all too short. Last night I had watermelon, raspberries and pink grapefruit - it looked sensational in its shades of ruby, and I will have it again tonight to finish the vast lump of melon left in the fridge. </p> <p>But what about the fruit that looked good in the greengrocers but fails to live up to its promise? I have two suggestions and an emergency measure to pass on here. Passion fruit juice squeezed over the fruit will tease out its flavour, as will a few drops of balsamic vinegar. If these fail, you could always try a thin syrup made from twice as much water as sugar, boiled till the sugar dissolves, then allowed to cool thoroughly before you add the fruit. A little lemon juice or some chopped mint can turn even the saddest little strawberry into something worth getting a spoon out for. </p> <p><strong> Strawberry, passion fruit and mint</strong></p> <p> You will need a couple of passion fruit for each portion of strawberries. Check that the passion fruit is ripe, by which I mean heavily wrinkled. Hull the strawberries and cut them in half or even quarters, depending on their size. Halve the passion fruit and squeeze the juice and seeds into a bowl. Chop a couple of mint leaves per person very finely and stir them into the passion fruit, then add the strawberries and gently toss them about a bit. Cover with a small plate and leave for at least 20 minutes, an hour if you can. Serve lightly chilled. </p> <p><strong> Blackberry, blueberry and raspberry salad</strong></p> <p> A heady salad of the richest imaginable colour. Check over all the fruit, then mix it in roughly equal quantities. The textures are as interesting as the flavour here. Drizzle the berries with a little cr\u00e8me de cassis and serve at room temperature. </p> <p><strong> Warm raspberry salad</strong></p> <p> Tip the raspberries into an ovenproof dish. Sprinkle over a little caster sugar and leave them in a very low oven, 150 C/gas mark 2 for 25 minutes or so. Despite the fact that they have fallen and lost their shape, they will have produced copious red juice. Add just a touch - and I do mean a touch - of framboise or cassis. The rich, wine-red juices are the point of it all. Serve in pretty glasses, with elegant biscuits from a posh packet. </p> <p><strong> Salad of watermelon, blackberries and pink grapefruit</strong></p> <p> Cut the melon into wedges, then slice the soft flesh from the rind. Using the point of a knife, pick out all the seeds, then cut the flesh into fat chunks and drop into a bowl with as much of the juice as you can save. Pick over the blackberries - you want them to be juicy but sound - and toss them with the watermelon. Slice the peel from the grapefruit. Cut into segments, losing as much of the white skin as you can and catching the juice in the bowl. Toss gently then leave to chill. This is one salad that is best served very cold. </p> <p><strong> Syrup for a fruit salad</strong></p> <p> Sometimes a syrup will bring to life fruit that is not quite up to scratch. It works particularly well with peaches that prove disappointing. Try to let the sliced fruit stay in the syrup for at least an hour before serving. </p> <p><strong>600ml water <br> 250g caster sugar <br> 1 vanilla pod <br> the peel of a small lemon </strong></p> <p>Put the water and sugar in a stainless-steel pan and bring to the boil. When the sugar has dissolved, add the vanilla pod and the lemon rind and continue boiling for five minutes, then turn off the heat, but leave the vanilla and lemon in place. </p> <p>When the syrup is cool, remove the seasonings and chill it thoroughly. Taste the cold syrup and add a little rose or orange flowerwater to taste - start with no more than a teaspoonful. The syrup is now ready to use. </p> <p><strong> Banana, peach and raspberry brl\u00e9e</strong></p> <p> For those who just cannot take their fruit without cream. Serves 4. </p> <p><strong>175g caster sugar <br> 700g mixed bananas (peeled weight), peaches and raspberries <br> 350ml chilled double cream </strong></p> <p>Put the sugar in a heavy pan and pour in enough water to cover. Set over a medium to high flame to boil while you prepare the fruit. Slice the bananas, stone and slice the peaches, and remove any stems from the raspberries. Put all the fruit in a heat-proof serving bowl. </p> <p>Whip the cream until it forms gentle peaks. Take care not to overwhip it. Spoon in high waves over the fruit. The sugar in the pan will start to turn a pale, golden caramel after 10 minutes or less - watch it carefully, as it is prone to burning. </p> <p>The caramel is ready when it turns a rich, golden brown. Pour the caramel over the cream and fruit immediately - taking care not to splash or burn yourself. It will at once set to a crisp and shiny coat. Eat within 30 minutes. </p> <p><strong> Some good fruit salads</strong></p> <p> Blueberries, white currants and loganberries</p> <p>Blackberries and watermelon </p> <p>Raspberries, honeydew or ogen melon and orange </p> <p>Raspberries and eau de vie de framboise </p> <p>Dessert gooseberries, raspberries and apricots </p> <p>Blackberries, raspberries and blueberries </p> <p>Honeydew melon and blackberries.</p>",

Drizzle the berries with a little cr\u00e8me de cassis and serve at room temperature. Warm raspberry salad Tip the raspberries into an ovenproof dish. Sprinkle over a little caster sugar and leave them in a very low oven, 150 C/gas mark 2 for 25 minutes or so. Despite the fact that they have fallen and lost their shape, they will have produced copious red juice. Add just a touch - and I do mean a touch - of framboise or cassis. The rich, wine-red juices are the point of it all. Serve in pretty glasses, with elegant biscuits from a posh packet. Salad of watermelon, blackberries and pink grapefruit Cut the melon into wedges, then slice the soft flesh from the rind. Using the point of a knife, pick out all the seeds, then cut the flesh into fat chunks and drop into a bowl with as much of the juice as you can save. Pick over the blackberries - you want them to be juicy but sound - and toss them with the watermelon. Slice the peel from the grapefruit. Cut into segments, losing as much of the white skin as you can and catching the juice in the bowl. Toss gently then leave to chill. This is one salad that is best served very cold. Syrup for a fruit salad Sometimes a syrup will bring to life fruit that is not quite up to scratch. It works particularly well with peaches that prove disappointing. Try to let the sliced fruit stay in the syrup for at least an hour before serving. 600ml water 250g caster sugar 1 vanilla pod the peel of a small lemon Put the water and sugar in a stainless-steel pan and bring to the boil. When the sugar has dissolved, add the vanilla pod and the lemon rind and continue boiling for five minutes, then turn off the heat, but leave the vanilla and lemon in place. When the syrup is cool, remove the seasonings and chill it thoroughly. Taste the cold syrup and add a little rose or orange flowerwater to taste - start with no more than a teaspoonful. The syrup is now ready to use. Banana, peach and raspberry brl\u00e9e For those who just cannot take their fruit without cream. Serves 4. 175g caster sugar 700g mixed bananas (peeled weight), peaches and raspberries 350ml chilled double cream Put the sugar in a heavy pan and pour in enough water to cover. Set over a medium to high flame to boil while you prepare the fruit. Slice the bananas, stone and slice the peaches, and remove any stems from the raspberries. Put all the fruit in a heat-proof serving bowl. Whip the cream until it forms gentle peaks. Take care not to overwhip it. Spoon in high waves over the fruit. The sugar in the pan will start to turn a pale, golden caramel after 10 minutes or less - watch it carefully, as it is prone to burning. The caramel is ready when it turns a rich, golden brown. Pour the caramel over the cream and fruit immediately - taking care not to splash or burn yourself. It will at once set to a crisp and shiny coat. Eat within 30 minutes. Some good fruit salads Blueberries, white currants and loganberries Blackberries and watermelon Raspberries, honeydew or ogen melon and orange Raspberries and eau de vie de framboise Dessert gooseberries, raspberries and apricots Blackberries, raspberries and blueberries Honeydew melon and blackberries.",

To properly relish the gloaming, it has to smell.</p> <p>Thinking along these lines, I planted out the tobacco plants a fortnight ago. The tobacco plants? Is that inevitable? Are they obligatory? Well, yes, they do seem to be. At least the marvellous Nicotiana sylvestris are. Summer is not right without the 6ft flower spikes with the white tubes of flower falling off them like floral dreadlocks, the whole thing rising up from their fleshy, sticky leaves.</p> <p>The warm flush of tobacco-plant scent just as the sun is slipping below the tree line is as much a measure of summer as sweet peas, dry grass and tomatoes. The season could exist without these things, but it wouldn't exist enough.</p> <p>So every spring, greedy for my summer, I buy about four packets of N sylvestris, because I know I want masses, open the first packet, am reminded for the 20th year in succession how tiny the seeds are, sow one packet which, if sown reasonably thinly, will fill four seed trays, sow another packet because I've got it, a bit thicker this time because I don't have the space for eight trays of tobacco seedlings and about three weeks later prick out a quarter of them and chuck the rest away.</p> <p>I'm left with the contents of perhaps half a packet of seed and about 100 healthy plants. It is important not to plant them out until every hint of frost has passed - which for most of us is June - and because we use them to fill gaps as part of a succession following on from white foxgloves or poppies or the earlier flowers, they have a tendency to sit around for a few weeks longer than they should. This doesn't seem to matter if they are in a large enough pot, but can seriously stunt their later development if they are in plugs.</p> <p>Like all tobacco plants, they should go on flowering right up until the first frosts. If it is a mild winter, some plants will survive until next year and you will often find seedlings cropping up, even if the parent plant did not make it through the frosts.</p> <p>For a plant I so completely associate with my own private English summer, they are, thinking about it, pretty exotic, almost tropical-looking. That's for the eye. But they don't just look the part. They know how to smell as muskily seductive as any plant in the book.</p> <p>The flowers will shrink and close in bright sunshine and then open in the evening, releasing scent as they do. The hotter the daytime sun, the stronger the fragrance will be in the evening. In fact they are best planted in a sheltered, slightly shaded position rather than in full sun, both for the health of the plant and for the quality of the scent.</p> <p>I used to regularly grow N alata (or N affinis - I don't know which is right and am always bemused by the change of names of plants as botanists redefine family groups. I wish that we used more vernacular names and kept classification to the specialists. I am repeatedly told that there is no aspect of gardening that is so off-putting to the enthusiastic but daunted amateur), but have not done so for a few years, because they are getting harder to find without being mixed up in a muddle of colour.</p> <p>I don't like mixed seeds as a rule. They are not as dramatic - reaching only 3ft and are less trumpet-like, but smell wonderful and are easier for a container. None of the other available 'tobacco' plants seem to me to be worth growing, as they don't have any scent to speak of, although there is a certain magenta that always crops up in a mixed bag of tobacco plants which I like very much. I don't include N langsdorfii in this censure, and think it lovely, but then that is not grown for its scent.</p> <p>If you make an area designed primarily for sitting in in the evening, it is important that it should be sheltered and preferably with a stone or paved surface with at least one brick or stone wall. This is because these surfaces hold the heat as the air cools, intensifying the scents, as well as making it comfortable to sit out there for longer.</p> <p>For evening fragrance, you must have some honeysuckle working these heat-retentive walls. Lonicera periclymenum 'Belgica' is as lovely as it is ubiquitous. The hedges around here are full of L periclymenum in flower, and as you duck into the shade of a tree the scent adds another dimension to the moment.</p> <p>Unlike the tobacco plants or resiny herbs, such as lavender, rosemary or basil, it does not need the heat of the day to cook its oils, but likes the cool of morning or evening for the scent to be at its best. L x americana has the scent of cloves, and L japonica 'Halliana' is especially good for a shady wall.</p> <p>Cestrum is a climber I had not encountered until this summer when I visited Liz Collonette's garden in Guernsey while filming Real Gardens.

A musical version of her sexually explicit monologue at the close of James Joyce's 1922 novel, Ulysses, has been banned by Joyce's grandson.</p> <p>Molly Bloom: A Musical Dream is due to open next week on the Edinburgh Fringe but a letter from Stephen James Joyce to festival director Paul Gudgin has demanded that the cabaret show be pulled. The reclusive grandson, who lives in Paris and jealously guards the family literary estate, claims the show turns the 'masterful' words of the book into a 'circus act'.</p> <p>Writing initially to Anna Zapparoli, the Italian actress and singer who is to play Molly, he argued that 'The listener/viewer should not have their attention distracted by music, Molly lying on a piano...'</p> <p>The first edition of Ulysses was published in Paris and denounced by the church for its sexual content.

      "bodyText": "Molly Bloom, the promiscuous literary heroine who has caused more scandal than any other character in fiction, is in trouble again. A musical version of her sexually explicit monologue at the close of James Joyce's 1922 novel, Ulysses, has been banned by Joyce's grandson. Molly Bloom: A Musical Dream is due to open next week on the Edinburgh Fringe but a letter from Stephen James Joyce to festival director Paul Gudgin has demanded that the cabaret show be pulled. The reclusive grandson, who lives in Paris and jealously guards the family literary estate, claims the show turns the 'masterful' words of the book into a 'circus act'. Writing initially to Anna Zapparoli, the Italian actress and singer who is to play Molly, he argued that 'The listener/viewer should not have their attention distracted by music, Molly lying on a piano...' The first edition of Ulysses was published in Paris and denounced by the church for its sexual content. It was banned in Britain and the US. Zapparoli and her husband, composer Mario Borciani, have developed the show in Milan and plan to portray Bloom reclining on a grand piano rather than on the bed in which she conventionally delivers the bawdy monologue. The crude language used in the show is also likely to attract controversy if the curtain goes up this Wednesday. One number is called 'Song of the Big Hole', and the lyric to another tune is equally graphic: '`Standing there in front of me a crowbar sticking out at me he filled me with his cock so big and boisterous yet he must have eaten oysters and you feel so nice all over you there's nothing like a kiss a kiss gets into you inside you long and hot deep in your soul.'

      "byline": "Emily Bell",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>ITV as a patchwork network reached the beginning of the end last week. Clive Hollick, Labour peer and erstwhile media baron, sold his television assets - or at least the greater part of them - to Granada Media. Hollick's United News and Media will hang on to its market information and internet businesses and, it says, Express Newspapers. </p> <p>The \u00a31.75 billion purchase by Granada of all three of United's ITV licences - HTV, Meridian and Anglia - will be followed by the swift selling on of HTV to Carlton Communications for regulatory reasons. This leaves Carlton and Granada as the two companies owning the vast majority of an ITV quilt once owned by 16 different companies. Outside the two big players only Scottish Media Group now holds a significant licence. </p> <p>Hollick is expected to sell his remaining TV interest, a small stake in Channel 5, to RTL Group, which owns the other 64 per cent of the channel. The rest of the national press has focused on what may happen to the Express titles - the daily and Sunday newspapers - which Granada said from the outset it would not be interested in buying. </p> <p>Hollick is adamant that he doesn't wish to sell the papers, but they sit even less easily with the strategy of United now that the TV assets have gone. There are no synergies between the Express and market information businesses, and synergies with the online businesses are relatively minor. </p> <p>Buyers will not be hard to find - the rumoured interest of the Barclay brothers would certainly be real at the right price; US publisher Gannett would be able to take out the titles without missing a beat; and Trinity Mirror may well be tempted to apply its undoubted skill in the centre-left tabloid market to the Express . </p> <p>Hollick is clear that he would never rule out an advantageous deal that benefited his shareholders, but adds: 'We've stabilised the Express: it is a content offline business that can be leveraged into online revenues and that is a business we are very interested in sticking with.' </p> <p>He is ever the pragmatic businessman about the company's exit from television. Referring to the unrealistic conditions the DTI imposed on a Carlton/United merger, he says: 'We had a bum decision from Stephen Byers, and have sold our assets at a good price, but we're very proud of what we have achieved in the past nine years, from a television franchise bid which grew out of the Campaign for Quality Television.' </p> <p>Does he think that this broadcasting record will be safe in the hands of Granada Media chairman Charles Allen? 'I think he runs a very fine business and the move towards consolidating ITV is one which we started and is undoubtedly the right one,' says Hollick. </p> <p>As well as the ITV assets, United must now decide what to do with its 20 per cent holding in ITN, its 33 per cent share of digital terrestrial broadcaster SDN and a 20 per cent stake in SIS, the horse- racing satellite system installed in many betting shops. It seems unlikely that any of these assets will remain in the company for long. </p> <p>From Allen's perspective the deal is also a good one. He managed to extract the juice from United without having to buy the whole orange. The City, which so recently sneered at Granada's demerger plans and gave Allen a tough time, responded by sending the share price back up in typically fickle style. </p> <p>Allen has broken his 'holiday every 13 weeks' rule to crunch the demerger and acquisitions through, and now says his focus will shift to the future of the businesses he runs. </p> <p>'We will have the practical boring bit of assimilating Meridian and Anglia, but our attention really then will be on both driving and develop ing ITV as a business in partnership with Carlton and looking for partnerships in Europe.' </p> <p>The United buy-up - which makes Allen the key shareholder in ITV with Carlton for the time being playing a supporting role - will herald a number of changes to the UK's largest commercial broadcaster. </p> <p>'It is important that we develop ITV as a multi-channel business, using that brand as the core,' says Allen. </p> <p>This raises the question of whether ITV will now be more or less likely to offer its channel to Sky Television for its digital service. 'I think we would offer it to Sky, but only if we had a number of channels so ITV is not swamped in their digital offering.' </p> <p>A further matter of some urgency is appointing a chief executive to ITV. Again, Allen says this will now be sooner rather than later. 'It was difficult to make an appointment until the shareholdings were sorted out, but now they are we can crack on with it.' </p> <p>As a lead shareholder in ITV, another aim of Granada Media will be to 'strengthen the regions', which sounds suspiciously like a sop to the political rumblings that have accompanied the merger mania. A raft of backbench MPs have voiced their displeasure at the denuding of regional services caused by the centralisation of the big ITV operators. But this is something Allen says he is keen to reverse. </p> <p>A further intriguing facet of the newly formulated ITV will be the chess game between Granada and Carlton. They will for the time being work as the closest partners in ITV, but are highly likely to find themselves playing cat and mouse when regulations relax in the next couple of years. </p> <p> Allen dodges the sugges tion that he may soon be embroiled in a hostile takeover bid for Carlton, preferring to focus on the 'cooperation we can achieve in all areas while still being competitive in advertising and programming'. </p> <p>The big 'what next?' for Granada cannot be answered until the publication of the communications White Paper this autumn. It would be remarkable if the recommendations did not allow the step from three ITV companies to two to become the step from two to one. </p> <p>It would be equally remarkable if Allen were not in charge of that move, but as the past three weeks have proved, where media, the markets and the Government intersect there is no such thing as a certainty.</p>",

      "bodyText": "ITV as a patchwork network reached the beginning of the end last week. Clive Hollick, Labour peer and erstwhile media baron, sold his television assets - or at least the greater part of them - to Granada Media. Hollick's United News and Media will hang on to its market information and internet businesses and, it says, Express Newspapers. The \u00a31.75 billion purchase by Granada of all three of United's ITV licences - HTV, Meridian and Anglia - will be followed by the swift selling on of HTV to Carlton Communications for regulatory reasons. This leaves Carlton and Granada as the two companies owning the vast majority of an ITV quilt once owned by 16 different companies. Outside the two big players only Scottish Media Group now holds a significant licence. Hollick is expected to sell his remaining TV interest, a small stake in Channel 5, to RTL Group, which owns the other 64 per cent of the channel. The rest of the national press has focused on what may happen to the Express titles - the daily and Sunday newspapers - which Granada said from the outset it would not be interested in buying. Hollick is adamant that he doesn't wish to sell the papers, but they sit even less easily with the strategy of United now that the TV assets have gone. There are no synergies between the Express and market information businesses, and synergies with the online businesses are relatively minor. Buyers will not be hard to find - the rumoured interest of the Barclay brothers would certainly be real at the right price; US publisher Gannett would be able to take out the titles without missing a beat; and Trinity Mirror may well be tempted to apply its undoubted skill in the centre-left tabloid market to the Express . Hollick is clear that he would never rule out an advantageous deal that benefited his shareholders, but adds: 'We've stabilised the Express: it is a content offline business that can be leveraged into online revenues and that is a business we are very interested in sticking with.' He is ever the pragmatic businessman about the company's exit from television. Referring to the unrealistic conditions the DTI imposed on a Carlton/United merger, he says: 'We had a bum decision from Stephen Byers, and have sold our assets at a good price, but we're very proud of what we have achieved in the past nine years, from a television franchise bid which grew out of the Campaign for Quality Television.' Does he think that this broadcasting record will be safe in the hands of Granada Media chairman Charles Allen? 'I think he runs a very fine business and the move towards consolidating ITV is one which we started and is undoubtedly the right one,' says Hollick. As well as the ITV assets, United must now decide what to do with its 20 per cent holding in ITN, its 33 per cent share of digital terrestrial broadcaster SDN and a 20 per cent stake in SIS, the horse- racing satellite system installed in many betting shops. It seems unlikely that any of these assets will remain in the company for long. From Allen's perspective the deal is also a good one. He managed to extract the juice from United without having to buy the whole orange. The City, which so recently sneered at Granada's demerger plans and gave Allen a tough time, responded by sending the share price back up in typically fickle style. Allen has broken his 'holiday every 13 weeks' rule to crunch the demerger and acquisitions through, and now says his focus will shift to the future of the businesses he runs. 'We will have the practical boring bit of assimilating Meridian and Anglia, but our attention really then will be on both driving and develop ing ITV as a business in partnership with Carlton and looking for partnerships in Europe.' The United buy-up - which makes Allen the key shareholder in ITV with Carlton for the time being playing a supporting role - will herald a number of changes to the UK's largest commercial broadcaster. 'It is important that we develop ITV as a multi-channel business, using that brand as the core,' says Allen. This raises the question of whether ITV will now be more or less likely to offer its channel to Sky Television for its digital service. 'I think we would offer it to Sky, but only if we had a number of channels so ITV is not swamped in their digital offering.' A further matter of some urgency is appointing a chief executive to ITV. Again, Allen says this will now be sooner rather than later. 'It was difficult to make an appointment until the shareholdings were sorted out, but now they are we can crack on with it.' As a lead shareholder in ITV, another aim of Granada Media will be to 'strengthen the regions', which sounds suspiciously like a sop to the political rumblings that have accompanied the merger mania. A raft of backbench MPs have voiced their displeasure at the denuding of regional services caused by the centralisation of the big ITV operators. But this is something Allen says he is keen to reverse. A further intriguing facet of the newly formulated ITV will be the chess game between Granada and Carlton. They will for the time being work as the closest partners in ITV, but are highly likely to find themselves playing cat and mouse when regulations relax in the next couple of years. Allen dodges the sugges tion that he may soon be embroiled in a hostile takeover bid for Carlton, preferring to focus on the 'cooperation we can achieve in all areas while still being competitive in advertising and programming'. The big 'what next?' for Granada cannot be answered until the publication of the communications White Paper this autumn. It would be remarkable if the recommendations did not allow the step from three ITV companies to two to become the step from two to one. It would be equally remarkable if Allen were not in charge of that move, but as the past three weeks have proved, where media, the markets and the Government intersect there is no such thing as a certainty.",

The Observer has obtained a dossier detailing evidence of the dramatic effect of the publication of the names and the photographs of dozens of sex offenders in last Sunday's News of the World. The dossier, compiled by the Association of Chief Officers of Probation over the past week, contains reports of attacks on convicted paedophiles as well as dozens of examples of people who have contacted their probation officers to say they have no choice but to move. Children's charities ChildLine and the NSPCC have joined probation officers in calling on the newspaper to stop its campaign immediately, in the interests of public safety. But executives at the newspaper said that it would name another 50 paedophiles in today's edition. Senior police officers are concerned that this American-style 'naming-and-shaming' tactic will add to the 500 paedophiles and rapists who live itinerant lifestyles to avoid signing the sex offenders' register. In one case reported to the probation service, the police smashed down the door of a paedophile under supervision in the south-east of England to find that he had absconded.

All are described in the festival programme as 'magical', 'superb', 'eccentric, surreal, liberated', 'this subtle masterpiece', 'a visual treat' and so on, the organisers having no truck with dour Caledonian modesty. </p> <p>There are sections devoted to established directors and first-time offenders, the latter being unknown quantities, the former including two outstanding pictures from Cannes - Liv Ullmann's Faithless (21 August) from a script by Bergman, and Michael Haneke's first film outside Austria, Code Unknown (19, 20 August), starring Juliette Binoche. </p> <p>Of particular interest are movies by two directors whose careers received a major boost from the favourable critical attention their early work attracted at Edinburgh. Terence Davies showed his semi-autobiographical trilogy at the 1983 festival in Edinburgh to great acclaim and is now back with his version of Edith Wharton's The House of Mirth (19, 24 August), set in New York, filmed in Scotland, and thought by many to have been unfairly rejected by Cannes. </p> <p>The other director is Bernard Rudden whose impressive 50-minute The Hunger Artist, a transposition of Kafka's tale from Prague to Glasgow, was the major discovery of the 1995 festival. He's back this year with his first feature, Daybreak (22, 24, 26 August), set in the world of Edinburgh clubbers and low-lifes. </p> <p>The festival began in 1947 and to honour Scotland's greatest cineaste, John Grierson, the man who coined the term 'documentary', it was initially devoted to non-fiction films. Documentaries have continued to be a major strand, and two of the 19 films in the 'Imagining Reality' section are by Scots. Kevin Macdonald, whose One Day in September won an Oscar last March, is represented by A Brief History of Errol Morris (14/15 August), a portrait of the American documentarist whose own work has often been seen in Edinburgh. Murray Grigor, a former festival director, has on show the enticing The Work of Angels? (25/26 August), a study of the Book of Kells. It was Grigor who suggested in the days before Edinburgh instituted awards that a special prize should be created - the Mouton d'Or - for the year's most tedious work, a film capable of stunning a sheep at 15 yards. </p> <p>Another attractive aspect of Edinburgh is that the moviemakers come here not to give press conferences but to meet the audience and discuss their films with interested cinemagoers. Among this year's visitors are Liv Ullmann, Paul Verhoeven, Wong Kar-Wai and the composer Carter Burwell, who has written the scores of most Coen Brothers film, including O Brother, Where Art Thou?, which is being shown in the festival. </p> <p>Nothing new on view, however, compares with the work of Marcel Ophuls, subject of this year's retrospective.

      "body": "<p>Wolfgang Peterson's vivid account of life aboard a German submarine in the Second World War, Das Boot, is one of the great movies about seafaring. His new film, The Perfect Storm, though not quite in the same class, is, nevertheless, fit to be moored alongside it. </p> <p>The film is adapted by Bill Wittliff from Sebastian Junger's riveting documentary book about 'the storm of the century' that occurred around Hallowe'en 1991, when a hurricane moving north from Bermuda collided off the north-west coast of America with an Arctic blast moving south and an unusual cold front coming across Canada from the Great Lakes. In this context 'perfect' is an ironic meteorological term meaning 'the worst imaginable'. </p> <p>At the centre of the book and the film is a swordfishing boat, the Andrea Gail, working the Grand Banks from the port of Gloucester, Massachusetts, where the walls of the old town hall, seen in the opening sequence, record the names of the 10,000 fishermen lost at sea since 1623. We're introduced to the ship's captain, Billy Tyne (George Clooney), and his crew as they return with a catch much inferior to that of a friendly rival, the Hannah Boden, skippered by Linda Greenlaw (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio). </p> <p>Is Tyne's luck running out? Is the Grand Banks fishing ground becoming depleted? The crew are disappointed with their rewards, the owner of the Andrea Gail (unsympathetic Michael Ironside) sneers at the captain he employs. In consequence, Tyne decides to put to sea again two days later in a last attempt to retrieve a bad season. </p> <p>The Perfect Storm is much influenced by Howard Hawks. It's the story of dedicated professionals who work together at dangerous jobs, respecting each other's skills. Fishing is what they do - because they love it or because it promised to pay well or because it's all they know. The women stoically stand by or they act like the men (Mastrantonio is an archetypal Hawksian woman) or they go away. </p> <p>Most of the men are either anguished divorc\u00e9s, dedicated loners or on the point of giving up the sea for a woman. In a traditional scene at their gathering place, the Crow's Nest Tavern, their characters are established ready for the central business of the film - the effects of the storm. Like miners, they belong to a close community that practises a physically demanding trade living with memories of tragedies and knowing that disaster might strike any time. </p> <p>Eventually, the Andrea Gail puts out to sea, John Seale's photography giving the movie a crisp, clear, bracing feel, James Horner's emphatic score underlining the heroic aspect of the adventure. At first, the fish are brought in steadily on the 40 mile-long nets. But there's conflict between the unhappy Murph (John C. Reilly) and the difficult newcomer Sully (William Fichtner), which is broken up by the reliable Bugsy (John Hawkes) and the happy-go-lucky Jamaican, Alfred Pierre (Allen Payne). </p> <p>Then a shark they accidentally land injures the first mate, Bobby (Mark Wahlberg) and Murph is dragged overboard and nearly killed. When the catch drastically falls off, Tyne persuades them to go further out to a better fishing ground. Meanwhile, the meteorologist at a Boston TV station starts noticing the freak weather pattern. </p> <p>This is a story of man against an implacable, remorseless nature, not a factitious tale of confronting sea monsters or waterborne terrorists. But at its centre are the effects of economic imperatives. The boat is out because the crew need the money, and at a crucial juncture the ice-making machinery breaks down because of the owner's cost-cutting, so no more fish can be taken. </p> <p>A choice arises between heading home through the storm with their catch or evading the storm by going further out and thus having to ditch a catch they can't preserve. The voyage begins with them thinking of their living; it ends with them fighting for their lives. </p> <p>The storm is a stunning, gut-wrenching piece of film-making that leaves the spectator shattered. Petersen cuts between the community's agonies on land in Gloucester and the events at sea. In addition to the Andrea Gail, there's a foundering yacht to be helped, a rescue helicopter in desperate need of aerial re-fuelling, a merchant ship whose containers are being swept away like so many Lego bricks, and the Hannah Boden from which Greenlaw is relaying messages to the increasingly isolated Andrea Gail. The special effects are astonishing, but they never detract from the human story, which is old-fashioned in the finest sense. </p> <p>The cast look like real working men who've lived hard, open-air lives. Their dialogue is laconic and given our postmodern times and the fact that even at sea they watch a lot of action videos, they are perhaps aware of the roles they act out. After one fisherman is thanked by a hostile colleague whose life he's helped save, he remarks: 'You'd have done the same for me - isn't that what I'm supposed to say?' </p> <p>I was caught up in this movie far more than I was in Jaws and there's a memorial service in the Gloucester church that is every bit as moving as the funeral of Spencer Tracy in Captains Courageous, a picture that inevitably comes to mind. The first chapter of Junger's book has an unforgettable epigraph from Walter Scott's novel, The Antiquary: 'It's no fish ye're buying, it's men's lives.' I wish they'd quoted this in the film.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Wolfgang Peterson's vivid account of life aboard a German submarine in the Second World War, Das Boot, is one of the great movies about seafaring. His new film, The Perfect Storm, though not quite in the same class, is, nevertheless, fit to be moored alongside it. The film is adapted by Bill Wittliff from Sebastian Junger's riveting documentary book about 'the storm of the century' that occurred around Hallowe'en 1991, when a hurricane moving north from Bermuda collided off the north-west coast of America with an Arctic blast moving south and an unusual cold front coming across Canada from the Great Lakes. In this context 'perfect' is an ironic meteorological term meaning 'the worst imaginable'. At the centre of the book and the film is a swordfishing boat, the Andrea Gail, working the Grand Banks from the port of Gloucester, Massachusetts, where the walls of the old town hall, seen in the opening sequence, record the names of the 10,000 fishermen lost at sea since 1623. We're introduced to the ship's captain, Billy Tyne (George Clooney), and his crew as they return with a catch much inferior to that of a friendly rival, the Hannah Boden, skippered by Linda Greenlaw (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio). Is Tyne's luck running out? Is the Grand Banks fishing ground becoming depleted? The crew are disappointed with their rewards, the owner of the Andrea Gail (unsympathetic Michael Ironside) sneers at the captain he employs. In consequence, Tyne decides to put to sea again two days later in a last attempt to retrieve a bad season. The Perfect Storm is much influenced by Howard Hawks. It's the story of dedicated professionals who work together at dangerous jobs, respecting each other's skills. Fishing is what they do - because they love it or because it promised to pay well or because it's all they know. The women stoically stand by or they act like the men (Mastrantonio is an archetypal Hawksian woman) or they go away. Most of the men are either anguished divorc\u00e9s, dedicated loners or on the point of giving up the sea for a woman. In a traditional scene at their gathering place, the Crow's Nest Tavern, their characters are established ready for the central business of the film - the effects of the storm. Like miners, they belong to a close community that practises a physically demanding trade living with memories of tragedies and knowing that disaster might strike any time. Eventually, the Andrea Gail puts out to sea, John Seale's photography giving the movie a crisp, clear, bracing feel, James Horner's emphatic score underlining the heroic aspect of the adventure. At first, the fish are brought in steadily on the 40 mile-long nets. But there's conflict between the unhappy Murph (John C. Reilly) and the difficult newcomer Sully (William Fichtner), which is broken up by the reliable Bugsy (John Hawkes) and the happy-go-lucky Jamaican, Alfred Pierre (Allen Payne). Then a shark they accidentally land injures the first mate, Bobby (Mark Wahlberg) and Murph is dragged overboard and nearly killed. When the catch drastically falls off, Tyne persuades them to go further out to a better fishing ground. Meanwhile, the meteorologist at a Boston TV station starts noticing the freak weather pattern. This is a story of man against an implacable, remorseless nature, not a factitious tale of confronting sea monsters or waterborne terrorists. But at its centre are the effects of economic imperatives. The boat is out because the crew need the money, and at a crucial juncture the ice-making machinery breaks down because of the owner's cost-cutting, so no more fish can be taken. A choice arises between heading home through the storm with their catch or evading the storm by going further out and thus having to ditch a catch they can't preserve. The voyage begins with them thinking of their living; it ends with them fighting for their lives. The storm is a stunning, gut-wrenching piece of film-making that leaves the spectator shattered. Petersen cuts between the community's agonies on land in Gloucester and the events at sea. In addition to the Andrea Gail, there's a foundering yacht to be helped, a rescue helicopter in desperate need of aerial re-fuelling, a merchant ship whose containers are being swept away like so many Lego bricks, and the Hannah Boden from which Greenlaw is relaying messages to the increasingly isolated Andrea Gail. The special effects are astonishing, but they never detract from the human story, which is old-fashioned in the finest sense. The cast look like real working men who've lived hard, open-air lives. Their dialogue is laconic and given our postmodern times and the fact that even at sea they watch a lot of action videos, they are perhaps aware of the roles they act out. After one fisherman is thanked by a hostile colleague whose life he's helped save, he remarks: 'You'd have done the same for me - isn't that what I'm supposed to say?' I was caught up in this movie far more than I was in Jaws and there's a memorial service in the Gloucester church that is every bit as moving as the funeral of Spencer Tracy in Captains Courageous, a picture that inevitably comes to mind. The first chapter of Junger's book has an unforgettable epigraph from Walter Scott's novel, The Antiquary: 'It's no fish ye're buying, it's men's lives.' I wish they'd quoted this in the film.",

But it's increasingly difficult to ignore the changes going on both inside and around him.

And the voices in his head are getting louder. </p> <p>Hart's sensuously charged first novel echoes Thomas Hardy in its chronicling of rural England and doomed inevitability. Lewis's tragedy is that he is essentially a throwback to a simpler way of life that is no longer possible.

'Along with success,' he noted, 'come drugs, divorce, fornication, bullying, travel, meditation, medication, depression, neurosis and suicide. With failure,' he went on, 'comes failure.' His writing life was always lived somewhere between these poles, and, at its end, it seems, he was still wryly in thrall to recollections of the aftermath of his great early triumphs, and troubled by the perceived dip in literary fortunes that followed.</p> <p>It is the novelist's job to astonish, Heller knew that as well as anyone, but he was also more aware than most that 'after all, a new talent can be discovered only once. And astonish hardly more often than that.' His fate, like that of all extraordinary literary debutants, was to become 'acknowledged, accepted, assimilated and... familiar .'

      "bodyText": "Portrait of the Artist, as an Old Man Joseph Heller Scribner \u00a312.99, pp234 Buy it at BOL Joseph Heller once observed that success and failure were equally difficult to endure. 'Along with success,' he noted, 'come drugs, divorce, fornication, bullying, travel, meditation, medication, depression, neurosis and suicide. With failure,' he went on, 'comes failure.' His writing life was always lived somewhere between these poles, and, at its end, it seems, he was still wryly in thrall to recollections of the aftermath of his great early triumphs, and troubled by the perceived dip in literary fortunes that followed. It is the novelist's job to astonish, Heller knew that as well as anyone, but he was also more aware than most that 'after all, a new talent can be discovered only once. And astonish hardly more often than that.' His fate, like that of all extraordinary literary debutants, was to become 'acknowledged, accepted, assimilated and... familiar .' His valedictory response to that fate, what he calls a couple of times here his own 'Catch-22', was to attempt to write a clever book about failure. It is a moderate success. The book is cast in the voice of one Eugene Pota, indistinguishable in all but name from the author, who sits at his desk day after day, towards the end of his life, trying to conceive of a fitting closure to his career. You know the kind of thing: 'What I really want to do, I guess, is write another really good novel that will be a big bestseller and a natural for the movies.' Heller's book is made up of Pota's blanks and misfirings in pursuit of this quarry: the openings to books that are told by Tom Sawyer, grown up and on Wall Street; books written from the point of view of a famous work of fiction that begin 'I was conceived in the brain of Dostoyevsky or Kafka or Melville'; novels that are no more than one-liners, or odd lists, or novelties.

Pota has great titles (A Sexual Biography of my Wife is a favourite, and a project, too, that Heller was fond of referring to as a work in progress in his last interviews) but he lacks any conception of the words and sentences and chapters that might attach themselves to such promising monikers. Epigraphs float to the surface of his mind in place of outlines or themes or characters or dialogue: he knows, for example, that he would like the Duchess of Marlborough's line 'Last night my Lord returned from the wars and pleasured me twice with his boots on' on a frontispiece, but he has no idea of its book-length addendum.

You would not know this 'republican' fact from the work of Frank Prochaska; for one thing his book begins at the arbitrary date of 1760 and for another he seems hopelessly unaware of the deep roots upon which the English anti-monarchical tradition can draw. </p> <p>Prochaska's book is misleadingly entitled, as if to suggest it's a history of republican thought. It turns out to be a tepidly written apologia for monarchy, based on the somewhat casuistical assumption that we already live in a republic and have done so, without quite realising it, for some considerable time. </p> <p>Now it is true, as he never wearies of saying, that the Latin words res publica only mean what they say - 'a thing of the public' - and do not necessarily connote an absence of kingship. Even Tom Paine, who is quoted too much and to too little effect in these pages, said that any form of democratic rule could be described as republican. But a moment's reflection disposes of this pedantry. </p> <p>Does Prochaska think it would have made no difference if George Washington, Paine's commander-in-chief, had accepted the title of monarch instead of rejecting it? To the American project, whether Democratic or Republican, it would obviously have made an immense difference. (If his opening chapters induce anybody to read Paine in the original, they will partly redeem their nullity.) </p> <p>Prochaska, who never misses a chance to condescend to the 'marginal' nature of republican agitation, never asks himself why it has kept on reviving and recombining. As I say, he starts in the wrong place. But he is intellectually at a loss to understand why the thread remains continuous, probably from 1389, if not earlier, and all the way through the Civil War, to the supporters of Paine and Wilkes, through Bentham, the Chartists, Bradlaugh and Dilke, the early Labour movement and - via innumerable filiations - to its strong revival today. Tennyson and H.G. Wells may both have popularised the oxymoron 'crowned republic', but the expression has not been bled of its absurdity. </p> <p>He shows his hand, and his style, very early on: 'The greatest threat to the monarchy in modern history has come not from domestic enemies, but from external ones. Had Britain been defeated by Napoleon or lost wars in 1918 or 1945, the case against the Crown might have seemed more cogent. But in a nation that has not been invaded, nor had a revolution since the seventeenth century, in which the sovereign's power has dwindled to influence, it is perhaps not surprising that the monarchy has been retained. \"Why keep it?\" ask the enemies of the Crown. \"Why all the fuss?\" reply the general public, who refuse to be reasoned out of monarchy.' </p> <p>Such a mass of confusion in such a few ill-chosen words! Prochaska's own subsequent evidence is enough to confirm that it was external menaces, from France and Germany and Russia, that served to confirm monarchy as a symbol of nationalism, and to mute domestic criticism. While, if the First World War had gone the other way, the victors or conquerors would have been a German branch of the newly-titled House of Windsor. (If the same had happened in 1940, which is the date I presume Prochaska intends, we know that Hitler planned to install the Nazified branch of that very family.) So it's hard to see where 'cases' or 'cogency' come in to it. </p> <p>Finally, it is the enemies of the Crown who ask 'Why all the fuss?' at each successive display of ostentation and vulgarity, while to identify 'the general public' with the monarchist cause is to disqualify oneself as a historian. </p> <p>The principal interest of this book lies exactly in the monarchy's realisation that it has not always been popular or secure. During the Regency, the reign of George IV and of William IV, republican feeling was evident and extreme police measures had to be employed to keep it in check. Late Victorian spin doctors fretted about the contempt in which the throne was held. At the time of the Abdication, there were Establishment figures who thought the game might be up. During the wedding hysteria of Prince Charles and Princess Diana, which even Robert Runcie, the late Archbishop of Canterbury, knew to be a frigid and empty fraud, who would have guessed how compromised the royal family would look two decades later? </p> <p>Prochaska scores a few points on the inessential details. He is right in saying that the expense of the Civil List has generally been exaggerated. He is correct in pointing out that the Palace has always sought to use charity, and its patronage of same, as a tactic (to replace its lost ability to cure scrofula). </p> <p>He leaves out, however, entire segments of relevant history, such as the royal family's support for appeasement. And he cannot set himself to answer the question why, if the monarchy is such a constitutional irrelevance, it is defended by the conservative interest with such irrational tenacity. Arguing against himself, in any case, he cites numerous examples of flagrant and unconstitutional meddling by the Crown, such as the private police-intelligence system directed at the Labour movement and maintained by George V. </p> <p>All in all, it's a sorry mixture of a book, unable even to make its own contradictions interesting.

Nevertheless, Weidenfeld offered him a six-figure advance to write about the one real passion of his life apart from soldiering: archaeology. The result, Living with the Bible, is recognised as a classic of amateur research and was a great commercial success. </p> <p>For Amos Elon, it is made all the more engaging - or offensive, depending on your perspective - by Dayan's deeply held conviction that the modern state of Israel was legitimised by the work of archaeologists. In one interview quoted in A Blood-Dimmed Tide, Dayan said: 'Everything that ancient Israel was. Those who lived here then... I sometimes feel I can literally enter their presence.' </p> <p>Dayan, with his trademark eye patch and straight-backed military bearing, was an icon of the Israeli state, the very image of the tough 'new Jew', or Sabra, who had helped build the most powerful army in the Middle East within 30 years of the Holocaust. Archaeology may seem like a peculiar private passion for a man who was ridiculed as a brute by more obviously intellectual Israeli politicians - Golda Meir described him as 'that Arab' as a mark of her disdain. Elon explains, however, that archaeology was etched into the very soul of the new Israel. 'Dayan's fame,' he says, 'contributed to the popular appeal of archaeology as a bloodless field sport.' </p> <p>The Arab-Israeli conflict has been dug over, sifted, noted, labelled and analysed more intensely than any other since the Second World War. The Israeli writer Elon has done more digging than most, and this collection of essays, written between 1967 and 1997, is truly great journalistic archaeology. First published three years ago, the collection has been fully revised in the light of recent developments and a new introduction was written after Ehud Barak's landslide election victory last year. It is worth reading for this introduction alone, a remarkable crystallisation of three decades of Israeli politics in 20 pages. </p> <p>Elon's patriotism is honestly declared and only occasionally obtrusive. In his first-hand description of the Six Day War of 1967, he wears his pride in Israel's achievements on his sleeve, but this does cauterise him against his shock at the scale of the Israeli victory.</p> <p>In scenes remarkably close to those witnessed in the allied defeat of Saddam Hussein's army in 1991, Elon recounts the complete humiliation of the Egyptian forces with genuine humanity, describing how many of the retreating soldiers threw off their uniforms in the hope of passing themselves off as civilians: 'Shoes - tens, hundreds of shoes, cast off when their owners, broken as soldiers, had turned into frightened men and tried to escape into the dry hills - barefoot in their underwear, bareheaded and without water.' </p> <p>Meanwhile, Elon reports, Radio Cairo was broadcasting in Hebrew that victory was still possible: 'We have lured you into the desert so we can destroy your hinterland at our ease... we still haven't used our secret missiles... O foolish Israeli soldiers we'll catch your one-eyed General Dayan and take out his other eye.' There were no secret missiles and defeat was total. </p> <p>Dayan is clearly Elon's favourite subject and there are two essays devoted entirely to the deeds of the general. But the essay on archaeology and politics is the real jewel of the collection. Written in 1995, it looks forward to a time when the Israeli people have escaped from a neurotic obsession with their past. The fact that the collapse of negotiations last week coincided with yet another demonstration of fundamentalist Jews at the Dome of the Rock suggests there is still a long way to go. </p> <p>The title comes from Yeats: 'The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere/ The ceremony of innocence is drowned.'

The interest in the the emotional and the intimate has been steadily rising for years, and a disaster meets this mood as almost the perfect public event. It legitimises our individualistic society's need to feel, and to do so, however shallowly, together. Of course, a plane crash is a more complete disaster than almost any other.

It is often claimed that the food and booze is tax-free, but in fact it is simply cheaper because the shop is run on a non-profit basis. Its days are now numbered and a decision has been taken to shut it down as part of a review carried out to determine what the European Commission's priority tasks should be. The issue has proved so emotive in the past, however, that the Commission is noticeably reluctant to publicise what some consider to be a rather humiliating climb-down and others believe to be a dose of common sense.

EU officials vehemently deny that the decision to close it down was prompted by media criticism and many continue to argue that there is nothing unsavoury or untoward about its existence.

      "bodyText": "You can almost hear the cries of 'Enough already!' in the mating fields of north London. The legendary Jewish mother, who handpicks girlfriends for her sons, is out of a job. Kosher Casanovas are swapping bagel bars for internet cafes to date online. A match-making service, which boasts the largest directory of Jewish singles, video-dating, chat-up rooms, and daily sex positions from the 'Kosher Sutra', is threatening an institution as Jewish as chicken soup. Jewish matriarchs, rabbis and community leaders who fear the online service will encourage casual sex have condemned it as anti-Jewish. The Jewish Telegraph has refused to publish advertisements that feature half-naked dolls with the slogan 'Your Mother wouldn't like it .... but you will.' Totally Jewish Dating is an online service for Britain's 300,000-strong Jewish community. Its editor, David Garfinkel, says Jewish match-making is as old as the bible and the service simply brings it up to date - bypassing over-protective mums. 'The Jewish mother is legendary. She clucks over her sons and makes sure prospective partners can cook kneidlach in precisely the same way as her. But now Jewish men and women are using new ways to find partners for themselves.' So many twenty-to-thirty somethings and divorc\u00e9s tried to register when the site opened last week that the email system crashed. Daniel Solomons, a 27-year-old media planner from London, who sent in his photograph, said: 'My mum and auntie have tried setting me up in the past but none of the dates worked out. So I decided to check out the website. I've already got an email from a girl who is interested in meeting.' David Israel from Leeds added: 'Young people hate their mothers setting them up on a blind date. Let's face it, we're living in the twenty-first century, not a remake of Fiddler on the Roof.' But rabbis and community leaders have accused the site's operators, who run a regular 'get flirty with our PlayDate of the week in our totally Jewish jacuzzi' slot, of undermining traditional Jewish values. Jonny Waters, a Jewish youth leader and religious teacher, said: 'From a religious perspective, it oversteps the mark.' But what do Jewish mothers think? Is computer dating kosher? Susan, a mother-of-two from north London, said: 'The only microchip a Jewish man needs is the one in his mother's head which sniffs out the nearest single Jewish woman and says to her son 'Just go for a coffee. What do you have to lose?' Jewish parents want their children married but not this way.' john.arlidge@observer.co.uk totallyjewish.com",

The false invoice was not the only financial irregularity that was exposed during the trial. The court further heard the Woodwards claim that their finances had been `wiped out' as a result of the time they spent in America with their savings falling from \u00a310,000 to just\u00a32,000. In fact, their assets had increased to around \u00a337,000 and they had banked a further\u00a350,000 from a newspaper after agreeing to sell their story.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Conviction rates for rape have fallen to a record low, raising fresh concerns that women who take cases to the police are facing a traumatic struggle through the criminal process with little hope of success.</p> <p>New figures from the Home Office reveal that, although nearly 8,500 cases of rape were reported to the police last year, only 634 resulted in convictions, a rate of just 7.5 per cent.</p> <p>Campaigners say the figures reveal a crisis at the heart of the criminal justice system, which appears unable to collect sufficient evidence to produce successful rape convictions.</p> <p>Last week the Government published its sexual offences review which proposed overhauling rape law to make it easier to bring cases, particularly by redefining the legal definition of consent.</p> <p>It said action was needed as 'of all the sexual offences, rape is the most serious, the most feared and the most debated'. It said the present law was inadequate.</p> <p>'This is a shocking figure,' said Helen Jones, of the Rape Crisis Federation. 'There has been a greater awareness of rape since the beginning of the 1990s, which is not being reflected by the number of successful prosecutions.'</p> <p>In 1985, despite only 1,840 women reporting that they had been raped, 450 men were found guilty, a conviction rate of 24 per cent. That figure had fallen to 17 per cent by 1990.</p> <p>Jones said the police, under pressure to improve their figures for clearing up crime, were reluctant to pursue long and complex rape cases where there was little hope of a conviction.</p> <p>'They should investigate these cases with more rigour,' she said. Police say convictions are hard to come by because the allegations often rest on one person's word against another.</p> <p>The Home Office has now demanded action from the Crown Prosecution Service and the police to push up the low figure.</p> <p>Campaigning groups say Britain should learn from America, where the use of special advocates who support women through the courts has pushed conviction rates above 50 per cent in Washington and New York states.</p> <p>The low conviction figure in Britain will reignite the debate about 'court attrition', the process where many victims of crime, particularly rape, give up on their cases because of the trauma involved.</p> <p>Jones said, of the rape cases brought to the attention of the police, a quarter were 'no crimed', meaning either the police said there was no case to answer or the women withdrew, a further third were dropped because of insufficient evidence, 11 per cent failed because the perpetrator was not identified, 8 per cent were discontinued by the CPS, 7 per cent resulted in acquittal and 7 per cent resulted in convictions for lesser offences.</p> <p>Every year 50,000 women contact the Rape Crisis Federation.

      "bodyText": "Conviction rates for rape have fallen to a record low, raising fresh concerns that women who take cases to the police are facing a traumatic struggle through the criminal process with little hope of success. New figures from the Home Office reveal that, although nearly 8,500 cases of rape were reported to the police last year, only 634 resulted in convictions, a rate of just 7.5 per cent. Campaigners say the figures reveal a crisis at the heart of the criminal justice system, which appears unable to collect sufficient evidence to produce successful rape convictions. Last week the Government published its sexual offences review which proposed overhauling rape law to make it easier to bring cases, particularly by redefining the legal definition of consent. It said action was needed as 'of all the sexual offences, rape is the most serious, the most feared and the most debated'. It said the present law was inadequate. 'This is a shocking figure,' said Helen Jones, of the Rape Crisis Federation. 'There has been a greater awareness of rape since the beginning of the 1990s, which is not being reflected by the number of successful prosecutions.' In 1985, despite only 1,840 women reporting that they had been raped, 450 men were found guilty, a conviction rate of 24 per cent. That figure had fallen to 17 per cent by 1990. Jones said the police, under pressure to improve their figures for clearing up crime, were reluctant to pursue long and complex rape cases where there was little hope of a conviction. 'They should investigate these cases with more rigour,' she said. Police say convictions are hard to come by because the allegations often rest on one person's word against another. The Home Office has now demanded action from the Crown Prosecution Service and the police to push up the low figure. Campaigning groups say Britain should learn from America, where the use of special advocates who support women through the courts has pushed conviction rates above 50 per cent in Washington and New York states. The low conviction figure in Britain will reignite the debate about 'court attrition', the process where many victims of crime, particularly rape, give up on their cases because of the trauma involved. Jones said, of the rape cases brought to the attention of the police, a quarter were 'no crimed', meaning either the police said there was no case to answer or the women withdrew, a further third were dropped because of insufficient evidence, 11 per cent failed because the perpetrator was not identified, 8 per cent were discontinued by the CPS, 7 per cent resulted in acquittal and 7 per cent resulted in convictions for lesser offences. Every year 50,000 women contact the Rape Crisis Federation. Of those only 7 per cent go on to contact the police. The low figures for rape convictions come as senior police officers raise further concerns about an upward trend in reported sexual offences. Home Office figures show that, although rates of sex crimes dropped between 1985 and 1995, they have steadily risen since that time. Police worries will be raised in an article next month in Nexus, the magazine of the National Criminal Intelligence Service, by Norman Trew, head of its Serious Sexual Offenders Unit. He says that, although it is impossible to tell whether there has been an increase in the number of crimes being committed, he believes that increased public awareness of the problem has led to a sharp increase in reporting. According to Trew, the figures have almost certainly been inflated by the fact that increasing numbers of people are coming forward to report crimes allegedly committed 10 or even 20 years ago. The huge number of investigations into children's homes has also thrown up hundreds of new cases.

      "body": "<p>On pager 140 of last week's sexual offences review report, among a list of advisers which includes Dr Brenda Rogers of the British Medical Association and the Justice and Victims Unit of the Home Office, comes the name of Claire Wilson-Thomas. Wilson-Thomas is important. She is policy manager at Care. Not many people have heard of Care - it stands for Christian Action, Research and Education.</p> <p>Care cares about a lot of things. It cares about lowering the age of consent for gay people. It cares about the repeal of Section 28. It cares about women having abortions, the rising number of teenage pregnancies and the decline of the family. It cares about morality and says that it is an organisation concerned with `declaring Christian truth and demonstrating Christ's compassion. We undertake this by campaigning, providing resources, undertaking caring work and bringing Christian insight and experience to matters of public policy, education and practical caring initiatives'.</p> <p>Ben Bradshaw, the Labour MP for Exeter who is gay and a member of the Socialist Christian Movement, describes them as `a bunch of homophobic bigots'.</p> <p>The appointment of Wilson-Thomas to the reference group for the Home Office's sex offences review has raised eyebrows. To many in the gay community, Care's name is mud. But at the highest levels of government, its members are part of a new movement of highly politicised Christians which is changing the face of British politics.</p> <p>These are the new Christian soldiers - well-organised, well- funded, disciplined and committed groups of people who have assiduously courted those in power. Last week saw their political high point - the emphatic Lords defeat of government proposals to repeal Section 28.</p> <p>The campaign was led by Baroness Young, who has close links with Care and two other leading religious groups that have built themselves into formidable lobbying organisations \u00d0 the Christian Institute and Family and Youth Concern.</p> <p>Members fly the flag for what they call `moral politics', coalescing around a disparate selection of issues, from genetic experimenta tion to setting up anti-abortion counselling services.</p> <p>Now they have a new focus. Along with plans for autumn campaigns against lowering the age of consent for gay people, the European directive on discrimination and the sexual offences review itself, the Government's decision to agree to the cloning of human embryos for research is set to stir up protest.</p> <p>Many of the campaigning techniques dovetail with the American experience where the Moral Majority movement has ensured that `pro-family' religious opinion is heard at the centre of power. Using many of the same techniques - mass letter-writing, forging close relations with politicians, courting newspapers, producing policy papers, finding sympathetic government officials to ply with information - Britain's newly enboldened Christian movement has given the country its first whiff of morality politics.</p> <p>Organisations such as Care feel they are on fertile territory. Tony Blair, though careful not to wear his religion on his sleeve, is a committed Christian who has raised the profile of religion in politics. In his memo leaked two weeks ago he mentioned `the family, where partly due to gay issues we are perceived as weak'. This is music to Care's ears.</p> <p>Many members of the Government, from David Blunkett to Paul Boateng to Jack Straw, are also strongly religious. That is not to suggest that any member of the Government has any truck with right-wing Christian groups, but such groups have taken advantage of an atmosphere of religious debate.</p> <p>`They cannot be dissatisfied with their leverage,' said Richard Kirker, head of Lesbian and Gay Christians. `The problem we have on the Left is complacency. We thought we had won all these battles. We were wrong.'</p> <p>The campaign against the European directive on employment is set to become increasingly bitter. In a glossy pamphlet produced by the Christian Institute, the arguments that will be deployed are laid out. `The directive would make it illegal for organisations to refuse to employ an individual because of that individual's religious views or sexual orientation.</p> <p>`Religious groups could be forced to employ atheists or practising homosexuals in key positions. Practising homosexuals who claim to be `gay Christians' will get a legal right to apply for all posts.' Kirker describes the pamphlet as `offensive'.</p> <p>The booklet says that those opposed to the directive should write to Blair. `You may want to include some of the following points in your letter (in your own words [their italics]),' the booklet says.</p> <p>It is a classic ploy by the new Christian movement which has targeted the House of Lords in its efforts to overturn disliked legislation. In a note to its members, Family and Youth Concern insisted on the importance of mass letter-writing in the battle against Section 28. `Members took their part in informing a large number of peers about the protection which Section 28 should provide children against the presentation of homosexual relationships as normal and other family types comparable with marriage. The booklet, Bankrolling Gay Proselytising - a selection of `pro-gay' material from local authorities put together by the Christian Institute - was sent to them with a list of peers to whom to write, thus ensuring that all named peers received letters.</p> <p>`Baroness Young told us that the flood of well-reasoned letters had an enormous influence on the majority vote to retain the clause. Letters do count.'</p> <p>Young invited the Christian Institute to set up an exhibition in the House of Lords on the issue of Section 28 which displayed examples of `taxpayer-funded materials which promoted homosexuality'. Colin Hart, the institute's director, and Simon Calvert, his deputy, have special access passes to Parliament which allows them to meet Ministers, peers and MPs where it matters, in the corridors of power.

      "bodyText": "On pager 140 of last week's sexual offences review report, among a list of advisers which includes Dr Brenda Rogers of the British Medical Association and the Justice and Victims Unit of the Home Office, comes the name of Claire Wilson-Thomas. Wilson-Thomas is important. She is policy manager at Care. Not many people have heard of Care - it stands for Christian Action, Research and Education. Care cares about a lot of things. It cares about lowering the age of consent for gay people. It cares about the repeal of Section 28. It cares about women having abortions, the rising number of teenage pregnancies and the decline of the family. It cares about morality and says that it is an organisation concerned with `declaring Christian truth and demonstrating Christ's compassion. We undertake this by campaigning, providing resources, undertaking caring work and bringing Christian insight and experience to matters of public policy, education and practical caring initiatives'. Ben Bradshaw, the Labour MP for Exeter who is gay and a member of the Socialist Christian Movement, describes them as `a bunch of homophobic bigots'. The appointment of Wilson-Thomas to the reference group for the Home Office's sex offences review has raised eyebrows. To many in the gay community, Care's name is mud. But at the highest levels of government, its members are part of a new movement of highly politicised Christians which is changing the face of British politics. These are the new Christian soldiers - well-organised, well- funded, disciplined and committed groups of people who have assiduously courted those in power. Last week saw their political high point - the emphatic Lords defeat of government proposals to repeal Section 28. The campaign was led by Baroness Young, who has close links with Care and two other leading religious groups that have built themselves into formidable lobbying organisations \u00d0 the Christian Institute and Family and Youth Concern. Members fly the flag for what they call `moral politics', coalescing around a disparate selection of issues, from genetic experimenta tion to setting up anti-abortion counselling services. Now they have a new focus. Along with plans for autumn campaigns against lowering the age of consent for gay people, the European directive on discrimination and the sexual offences review itself, the Government's decision to agree to the cloning of human embryos for research is set to stir up protest. Many of the campaigning techniques dovetail with the American experience where the Moral Majority movement has ensured that `pro-family' religious opinion is heard at the centre of power. Using many of the same techniques - mass letter-writing, forging close relations with politicians, courting newspapers, producing policy papers, finding sympathetic government officials to ply with information - Britain's newly enboldened Christian movement has given the country its first whiff of morality politics. Organisations such as Care feel they are on fertile territory. Tony Blair, though careful not to wear his religion on his sleeve, is a committed Christian who has raised the profile of religion in politics. In his memo leaked two weeks ago he mentioned `the family, where partly due to gay issues we are perceived as weak'. This is music to Care's ears. Many members of the Government, from David Blunkett to Paul Boateng to Jack Straw, are also strongly religious. That is not to suggest that any member of the Government has any truck with right-wing Christian groups, but such groups have taken advantage of an atmosphere of religious debate. `They cannot be dissatisfied with their leverage,' said Richard Kirker, head of Lesbian and Gay Christians. `The problem we have on the Left is complacency. We thought we had won all these battles. We were wrong.' The campaign against the European directive on employment is set to become increasingly bitter. In a glossy pamphlet produced by the Christian Institute, the arguments that will be deployed are laid out. `The directive would make it illegal for organisations to refuse to employ an individual because of that individual's religious views or sexual orientation. `Religious groups could be forced to employ atheists or practising homosexuals in key positions. Practising homosexuals who claim to be `gay Christians' will get a legal right to apply for all posts.' Kirker describes the pamphlet as `offensive'. The booklet says that those opposed to the directive should write to Blair. `You may want to include some of the following points in your letter (in your own words [their italics]),' the booklet says. It is a classic ploy by the new Christian movement which has targeted the House of Lords in its efforts to overturn disliked legislation. In a note to its members, Family and Youth Concern insisted on the importance of mass letter-writing in the battle against Section 28. `Members took their part in informing a large number of peers about the protection which Section 28 should provide children against the presentation of homosexual relationships as normal and other family types comparable with marriage. The booklet, Bankrolling Gay Proselytising - a selection of `pro-gay' material from local authorities put together by the Christian Institute - was sent to them with a list of peers to whom to write, thus ensuring that all named peers received letters. `Baroness Young told us that the flood of well-reasoned letters had an enormous influence on the majority vote to retain the clause. Letters do count.' Young invited the Christian Institute to set up an exhibition in the House of Lords on the issue of Section 28 which displayed examples of `taxpayer-funded materials which promoted homosexuality'. Colin Hart, the institute's director, and Simon Calvert, his deputy, have special access passes to Parliament which allows them to meet Ministers, peers and MPs where it matters, in the corridors of power. Young also wrote to Church leaders, enclosing a summary of the institute's booklet. `It is now essential that Christians write to the Prime Minister and their MP,' the letter said. `There has always been a moral element to politics,' Calvert said. `It is not about whether morality will have an influence on politics, it is about what type of morality will have an influence on politics. All sides are claiming the moral high ground. We are described as bigoted and homophobic. That is a moral judgment.' Hart is convinced that groups such as the Christian Institute have `the majority' on their side. `People are worried about their children, about family life, about what is being taught in schools.' Calvert says he has been invited to meet Straw to discuss the sexual offences review in September. The institute will attack the review's recommendation that offences of gross indecency and buggery, which apply only to men, should be repealed. Calvert was on one of the working parties that advised on the `abuse of trust' sections of the review which dealt with incest and the relationship between children and adults. The institute has also been seen by Women's Minister Tessa Jowell. Treasury officials invited Care representatives to discuss proposals on how tax breaks could support marriage. In themedia, there are also the flag carriers. The deputy director of Family and Youth Concern is Cornelia Oddie, wife of William Oddie, editor of the Catholic Herald. The Herald is owned by Conrad Black, who also owns the Daily Telegraph. Both the Telegraph and the Daily Mail have close links with the Christian groups and often campaign on issues, such as Section 28. Care, as well as supporting Young's office, runs an intern scheme where volunteers sympathetic to the cause are provided for MPs and peers, both Labour and Conservative. Once in Parliament, the interns can influence areas of debate and report back to Care what is coming up in the legisla tive programme that should be ringing alarm bells. The projects do not always run smoothly. During the 1997 election campaign a young volunteer, Caroline Mawson, worked with Bradshaw. She was also a member of Care, something that Bradshaw was initially unaware of, and told the organisation that she would like to work in his office after the election. Charlie Colchester, executive director of Care, asked Bradshaw for a meeting. `I was questioned in a highly inappropriate way,' Bradshaw said. `They were asking me about my sexual orientation. I was told after that that they were sorry, but the girl would not be working for me.' Bradshaw has now written to the Charity Commission. `I would urge you to investigate if Care broke charity law by discriminating in this way,' the letter says. `Also, where they stand under charity law regarding political activity.' Care refused to return calls from The Observer about the issue last week, although Calvert, of the Christian Institute, says that similar allegations of over-politicisation made against it are un-founded. The institute is no more political than the gay rights group Stonewall, he argues. Groups opposed to Care, the Christian Institute and Family and Youth Concern point out that the influence of the new Christian soldiers has made the Government nervous on a host of progressive issues such as gay rights and sexual equality.

      "body": "<p>Just as a road accident exerts a macabre hold over the onlooker, so does an air crash demand the attention of the TV viewer. And when the crash involves Concorde, a pristine symbol of safety and technical supremacy, the need to turn on a television and watch is almost overpowering.</p> <p>Late last Tuesday afternoon, television news teams were confronted with exactly that demand. By and large, they responded with tremendous speed and a great deal of information. What they were unable to do for the first hour after learning of the disaster, which took place at 3.47pm our time, was show any film from the scene of the accident. As one BBC executive said: `Clearly what people want to watch are the pictures.'</p> <p>The BBC, as subscribers to Eurovision, were able to get some footage on to their rolling news satellite channel BBC 24 by 5.15pm, which they claim was well in advance of their competitors, Sky News, although Sky say they also ran their first shots from the crash at the same time. What followed over the next two days was probably the most well-documented coverage of an air disaster in history.</p> <p>The only moment missing on camera was the crash itself. But in the absence of that terrible instant, little was left to the imagination. Such was the devastation captured in the images shown on Tuesday night, that there was a great deal of confusion over whether the Concorde had hit a restaurant or a hotel. Even by the Nine O'Clock News Michael Burke seemed uncertain what had happened.</p> <p>An air crash and the consequent TV coverage bring together two distinct and often antipathetic cultures. The aviation industry spends months, sometimes years, accumulating evidence in the wake of a disaster. Television is interested only in the present.

      "bodyText": "Just as a road accident exerts a macabre hold over the onlooker, so does an air crash demand the attention of the TV viewer. And when the crash involves Concorde, a pristine symbol of safety and technical supremacy, the need to turn on a television and watch is almost overpowering. Late last Tuesday afternoon, television news teams were confronted with exactly that demand. By and large, they responded with tremendous speed and a great deal of information. What they were unable to do for the first hour after learning of the disaster, which took place at 3.47pm our time, was show any film from the scene of the accident. As one BBC executive said: `Clearly what people want to watch are the pictures.' The BBC, as subscribers to Eurovision, were able to get some footage on to their rolling news satellite channel BBC 24 by 5.15pm, which they claim was well in advance of their competitors, Sky News, although Sky say they also ran their first shots from the crash at the same time. What followed over the next two days was probably the most well-documented coverage of an air disaster in history. The only moment missing on camera was the crash itself. But in the absence of that terrible instant, little was left to the imagination. Such was the devastation captured in the images shown on Tuesday night, that there was a great deal of confusion over whether the Concorde had hit a restaurant or a hotel. Even by the Nine O'Clock News Michael Burke seemed uncertain what had happened. An air crash and the consequent TV coverage bring together two distinct and often antipathetic cultures. The aviation industry spends months, sometimes years, accumulating evidence in the wake of a disaster. Television is interested only in the present. It needs to know now. So a bridging language has evolved to accommodate the differing time spans. `I appreciate that it is early days', and, `While it would be wrong to speculate', have become the standard opening lines for presenters when speaking to anyone with professional knowledge of aircraft. But of course coverage at this stage is all about speculation. Following a previous accident in Paris \u00d0 the death of the Princess of Wales \u00d0 the nature of news coverage changed. Television discovered that with modern media resources, it was possible to explore one story in forensic detail. For the Concorde crash, the BBC, with 12 TV and radio channels to service, had Jon Sopel on the spot, but sent in a large back-up. Most surprising, perhaps, was the arrival of James Naughtie, who co-presented Radio 4's Today programme from the accident site in Gonesse, north-east of Paris, on Wednesday morning. He had the difficult task of combining introductions and interviews with descriptive reportage. `As you speak to me,' he intoned with due solemnity, `there's a procession of vehicles heading down to the crash site.' If live radio coverage of a happening event can attain a vividness and create an atmosphere beyond the image-linked confines of TV, then live radio coverage of a past event is as gripping as last week's newspapers. There was still much hard news to break on Wednesday - the pilot's request that an engine be checked shortly before take-off, and the release of the video of the Concorde on fire by Antenna 3, a Spanish TV station - but the ranks of assembled personnel had to find other stories to justify their presence. And by now the rolling news had gained unstoppable momentum. Thus locals around Gonesse were interviewed to see if they were worried about another plane crashing on them, when of course the only real danger they faced was the threat from all those flailing cameras. In attempting to sum up the tragedy, and possibly his reasons for being there, Naughtie closed on Tuesday with these words: `This is a moment in the history of air travel that for obvious reasons we're all going to remember.' That is probably true. But which moment will we remember? The instant that we learnt of the crash, through the supersonic speed of modern news coverage, or the French villagers patiently explaining that, no, they did not expect to be hit by another aircraft?",

      "body": "<p>By lunchtime the technicians in hangar QN had finished. With its engines popping and cracking as they cooled, Air France's oldest Concorde - registration code F-BTSC - sat gleaming under fluorescent lights. The team relaxed. Take-off was due at 2.25pm and the final tests had now been completed. It was 12.30pm.</p> <p>It had been a tough morning. The plane had arrived from New York at 9.30 the previous evening with some kind of fault. Though the daily shuttle across the Atlantic had passed without incident, the chief engineer had recorded odd readings in his log book. The Concorde was towed to a maintenance bay where a 12-man team of technicians worked on the four Rolls-Royce Olympus 593 engines. At around 2pm the plane was towed to parking bay 2B, close to Air France's headquarters and next to the control tower.</p> <p>Tuesday was not a good day for anyone at Charles de Gaulle airport. Storms had delayed scores of flights and angry passengers filled the departure halls. There were three-hour queues at the transfer desks and planes backing up all over Europe waiting for slots to land.</p> <p>One of the delayed planes was the early afternoon flight from Frankfurt. It was carrying 96 Germans on the trip of a lifetime. They were flying to Paris where, courtesy of Deilmann luxury travel company, they were to board a specially chartered Concorde for their 3 hours 45 minutes flight to New York. From there a cruise liner, the MS Deutschland, would take them through the Caribbean.</p> <p>The group landed in Paris shortly after 3pm. From the main terminals they were bussed to a smaller facility called T9, used by special charters. Again there were delays as their baggage was transferred. No one seemed to care, though. `They were all laughing and singing,' said an Air France official who checked the group in at T9. `They didn't mind waiting at all.'</p> <p>Perhaps happiest of all was Klaus Frentzem, an eccentric 53-year-old secondary school teacher and Concorde fanatic who had saved for 20 years to fulfil his dream of a supersonic flight. He had brought some of his extensive collection of Concorde memorabilia with him and proudly showed it to others in the departure lounge. A few hundred yards away sat their plane in the muggy July heat. Two Air France technicians were tinkering with motor number 2. This time there seemed to be a problem with its `thrust reverser', the shields that are lowered over the jets' blast to slow the plane. The hydraulic pump which activates the reversers was not working, and though the technicians were full of assurances that the fault would not affect the plane's performance the pilot insisted it be replaced. No spare was available so a pump was taken from another Concorde.</p> <p>The pilot was Christian Marty, one of the best known at Air France. With only 12 pilots qualified to fly the planes, all the Concorde crews were famous in the company, but 54-year-old Marty, with his shock of blond hair and outrageous achievements as a sportsman, stood out. A few years before he had completed the first crossing of the Atlantic on a sailboard. It had taken 37 days. He was a competition skier and a champion hang-glider too. `He was kind of intense,' said a friend. `He was a very dry, rigorous man.'</p> <p>It was in character for him to insist on the change. `He would never fly unless everything was 100 per cent,' the friend, a Concorde co-pilot, said. `He was a perfectionist. That's one of the reasons he was such a great pilot.'</p> <p>By 3.15 the pump had been replaced and Marty was satisfied. With co-pilot Jean Marcot, who had been flying Concordes for more than 10 years, and chief engineer, 58-year-old Gilles Jardinot, he started the pre-take-off checks. The six-strong cabin crew boarded the plane, and then the 100 passengers - including an American retired Air France employee who lived in Germany, an Austrian and two Danish tourists - filed up the mobile staircases and took their seats. It was 3.30. They had 15 minutes to live.</p> <p>From his desk on the third floor of Air France headquarters, Jean-Cyril Spinetta, the chief executive, watched the Concorde taxi on to the runway. For more than 10 minutes the plane sat on the tarmac. At 3.42 Marty was cleared for take-off and at 3.44 began to accelerate down runway 26. Then flames appeared under the left wing. Spinetta saw them from his executive suite. Ground staff beside the runway saw them and alerted the emergency services. The control tower saw them and hit the red crash button to alert the whole airport. Within seconds, as amateur photographers fired off frame after frame and lounges full of delayed passengers watched aghast, the burst of orange lengthened into a 30-metre stream of fire and black smoke. Perhaps the only people who couldn't see the blaze were the crew of the burning plane.</p> <p>But it is almost certain that they knew about it. Like all modern planes, Concorde has a range of systems to deal with fire in the engines. First a bell goes to warn the captain. He will usually shut off the noisy alarm and pull a fire handle on the ceiling of the cockpit above the windscreen to shut down the motor and cut off its fuel. A fire in one of Concorde's four engines should not cause too many problems. Three motors are enough to keep the plane airborne and allow the pilot, after dumping much of the 96 tonnes of aviation fuel, to look for an emergency landing site.</p> <p>As the front wheels lifted off the ground at 3.44.56 secs, the control tower radioed Marty to tell him they could see flames shooting from the plane. `Number two engine is out,' he said drily.</p> <p>But the plane was travelling at 250mph and had covered 4,200m of runway. It had reached V1 the speed at which it is considered impossible to abort a take-off safely. Though in hindsight it may have been a better option to take a risk, Marty followed the textbook procedure and pulled his stick back. The rear wheels left the ground. Flight AF 4590 was airborne. With a spout of flames and black smoke 40m long behind it.</p> <p>Within seconds Marty called the tower again. He was now having trouble with a second engine and reported that his undercarriage would not retract.</p> <p>Seconds later the pilot was on the radio again. He requested and was granted permission to try an emergency landing at Le Bourget airport, eight miles away, Spinetta watched the plane head south-west, leaving a thick line of oily smoke across the blue summer sky. It was only 100ft or so off the ground and had no thrust to gain altitude. Even that power was going. As the plane disappeared from view Spinetta quietly asked his secretary to get the Minister of Transport on the line. He had some bad news.</p> <p>Marc Olivier, a 24-year-old basketball player, was practising with friends in a park near his home near Gonesse when he heard the scream of Concorde's engines. They stopped playing and looked for the plane. For most people in Gonesse - a small, blue-collar town ringed by dual carriageways and industrial estates- the twice-daily flypasts by the world's most famous passenger plane are hardly something to get excited about.</p> <p>This time Concorde's approach sounded different. `You could hear the engines complaining as they tried to gain height,' Olivier told The Observer. `It was like they were screaming in pain.'</p> <p>The basketball players watched as the plane started to bank to the left and lose height. Describing a huge arc, it was soon almost facing back the way it had come. Its nose came up until it was almost vertical. Flames continued to spurt from its underside. `It started turning as if to avoid the town and then began swinging around and almost seemed to stand on end,' Olivier said. `The left wing was hitting the tops of the trees. Then the wing hit the ground and the plane flipped over and slid along the ground upside down, and then there were two explosions and everything disappeared in smoke and fire.'</p> <p>Marty, by design or accident, had avoided the main part of the town. The burning plane ploughed instead into a small hotel, the Hotelissimo, and exploded in a fireball `like an atomic bomb'.</p> <p>Five people were killed instantly: two young Polish women on a work experience programme were resting in their rooms, and a young Algerian maid who had been taken on the day before was making up beds with Devrance Chundursing, a 42- year-old Mauritian mother of two. The fifth body was found on Friday in the rubble under an engine. It was so badly burnt that identification of the sex was impossible. No one knows who it is.</p> <p>The death toll could have been much higher. A 21-year-old British student from Kent, Alice Brooking, was talking to her sister in London when the plane struck. She leapt through a first-floor window and suffered nothing more than minor burns and a bruised wrist.</p> <p>A bus-load of 44 teenagers, members of a Suffolk youth band, had been delayed by traffic. Their late arrival meant hotel manageress Mich\u00c1ele Ficheteau had given eight of her staff an extended break. Her secretary was out taking her dog for a walk. When the Concorde hit, the hotel eyewitnesses say it seemed to `vaporise'. Only a single charred wall remained upright. Within six minutes the emergency services were on the scene. There was little they could do other than play their hoses over the blazing wreckage. It was clear that no one could have survived in the plane. Early rumours of miraculous escapes were quickly proved optimistic. All 109 people on flight AF4590 died instantly. When the heat had subsided, rescue workers marked out the charred corpses and body parts with small plastic cones.</p> <p>Passengers at the airport were informed that `major problems' had forced a temporary halt of all flights. As stunned Air France staff wandered through the packed halls, news of the disaster quickly spread. In terminal T9, where the passengers had whiled away their wait with songs and card games, airport staff were in tears . `I was crying and crying,' said Marie Segal, a shop assistant. `I had watched all these people having fun. I had sold them newspapers and books for the flight. One told me how flying on Concorde was his life's ambition. He was so excited.'</p> <p>Yesterday investigators were still combing the jumbled wreckage for clues. The Air France Concorde fleet was still grounded. The press was still full of speculation.</p> <p>Two main investigations into the crash have been launched by French authorities. One is run by the Bureau Enqu\u00c2etes-Accidents (BEA), the official government aviation investigations unit whose duty is to ensure such an accident never happens again. The other is a judicial inquiry which aims to find out who, if anyone, should be charged with `involuntary manslaughter', a serious criminal offence. Usually a single magistrate is in charge. This inquiry has three. The scale of the judicial probe demonstrates both the gravity of the potential charges and the importance of some of the players in the tragedy. Senior staff at Air France, at the airport, even the Minister for Transport himself, are potentially personally liable under French law.</p> <p>There is a huge amount of data to work through. Just one of the two `black box' recorders contains 600 `parameters' which have to be analysed. Panels of experts including British, German and American specialists have been drafted in to help.</p> <p>By the end of last week an explanation was beginning to emerge. On Friday investigators from the BEA announced that one, and perhaps two, of the four tyres on the undercarriage under the left wing had exploded as the plane was racing down the runway. Those who know Concorde's history were immediately reminded of an incident more than 20 years earlier. In 1979 two tyres exploded on an Air France Concorde as it took off from Washington's Dulles airport. Pieces of the wheels' magnesium rims and other debris were sent smashing into the plane's body.</p> <p>A report by the American National Transport Safety Board, published two years later, revealed that `tyre debris and wheel shrapnel [had] resulted in damage to the No 2 engine, puncture of three fuel tanks, and severance of several hydraulic lines and electrical wires. Additionally, a large hole was torn in the top wing skin which covers the wheel well area.'</p> <p>The plane returned safely to Dulles, but pilots have always remembered the incident. `They were lucky,' said Patrick Augin, vice-president of France's largest pilots' union. 'It did not cause a fire in 1979, but it could have. It's just a matter of where the holes are.'</p> <p>As no debris from inside Flight AF4590's engines has been found on the runway investigators are playing down the idea that debris might have been sucked into the air intakes of its jets. Concorde is one of the few planes with air intakes situated directly behind its rear undercarriage. Experts point out that, with two huge intakes acting as giant hoovers, it is, whatever the BEA might say, unlikely that the motors themselves would have escaped unscathed.</p> <p>Any debris inside the engines would cause massive and immediate damage, dislodging dozens of the sharp turbine blades used to compress air. The blades in turn would act like shrapnel inside the engine, smashing it apart and slicing through power and fuel lines. They would also be likely to puncture the fuel tanks held in the wing and cut their way into the twin engine alongside. Just because investigators haven't found any parts from the engine on the runway does not mean they were unscathed when the plane crashed. Another possibility is that a wheel jammed and then burst. The undercarriage would then smash on to the runway. The impact would force it back up into the body of the plane, rupturing fuel lines.</p> <p>Once the thinly protected tanks in the wings or the fuel lines were damaged - by debris, or the undercarriage, or flying turbine blades- the leaking fluid would have been swiftly lit by a spark or chunk of hot metal. The burning fuel would be sprayed back by the airflow and the Rolls-Royce Olympus motors would have become huge flame-throwers. This would explain why, in the pictures of the stricken plane, the flames appear to originate from in front of the engines, though a plume of smoke and fire follows them. `Imagine a fireman's pressure hose squirting petrol across the mouth of a blast furnace and then multiply 100 or so times. It would have been so hot the metal of the plane itself would have been burning,' one former test pilot told The Observer. Another said the engines would have been converted into `giant cigarette lighters'.</p> <p>Aviation experts appear to have been concerned about the potential for such a disaster for some time. In 1982 the US Transportation Safety Board recommended - after several more incidents involving malfunction of tyres on the plane - that Concorde should be allowed to land at American airports only after a full inspection of wheels, tyres and landing gear before every flight. Two subsequent incidents, more than a year apart, prompted a mild rebuke of Air France for the ineffectiveness of its earlier directives implementing these recommendations.</p> <p>Pilots at British Airways, which operates seven Concordes, have long complained about the problem of burst tyres. With its fast take-off speed and sharp profile, Concorde is particularly hard on its undercarriage. On its first ever landing in America in 1976, engineers replaced a tyre which they felt was excessively worn. Some experts last week claimed that even a teaspoon left in its path could cause a blow-out. And the incidents appear to have recurred. At Heathrow in 1993 a burst tyre broke a glass-fibre water deflector and punctured a fuel tank. Earlier that year a tyre-burst due to brake seizure caused significant damage to a Concorde's engine, wing and hydraulics. The problem became so acute that BA installed a special alarm system in Concorde flight decks to alert the pilot on blow-out.</p> <p>Ever since its launch, experts have also worried about the plane's susceptibility to fire. A report by American fire specialists Blazetech written nearly 25 years ago mentions the vulnerability of Concorde to fires produced by catastrophic engine failures. It also appears that a British Aerospace report in 1976 raised concerns over the fire risk in Concorde's fuel tanks.</p> <p>A technical idiosyncrasy on Concorde explains why Marty was unaware of any blow-outs. When a tyre is faulty, a red light goes on in front of pilots - but only if Concorde is travelling at less than 150mph. At faster speeds it is impossible to stop, so the alarm is not activated. Marty had no idea what was happening underneath his plane. This explains why Marty attempted to raise the undercarriage - Air France's recommended procedure after a blow-out is to leave it down - after the plane took off.</p> <p>Implicit in British Airways' decision to continue flying Concorde is the accusation that it was poor management or maintenance that was responsible for the Paris tragedy. BA still clearly believes that the blame is not with the craft itself. `We wouldn't operate the aircraft if we thought it was unsafe,' a spokesman said.</p> <p>But the plane that crashed on Tuesday had undergone a 10-day inspection that ended on the Friday before the crash. And, with the rest of the Air France fleet, it had been given a complete refit, taking three months, last year. Nor can the company - still largely state-owned - be accused of cutting back on maintenance. Though costs have been slashed elsewhere to bring Air France into profit, Concorde has been seen as a symbol of national prestige and funded accordingly.</p> <p>Air France is refusing to answer technical questions about the crash. It has yet to confirm that the undercarriage and tyres were properly inspected before take-off. Nor is it yet clear if the repairs to the plane's engines, and particularly the fitting of the cannibalised thrust reverser minutes before take-off, were a factor in the crash. There are also serious questions over the condition of the runway. Was there an undetected flaw that caused a blow-out? Or maybe a rogue piece of uncleared detritus from the scores of flights that use the strip each day? The two technicians who fitted the equipment and many of the ground staff who maintained the strip were undergoing psychiatric counselling last week.</p> <p>BA's confidence in Concorde is not shared by Air France pilots. Some French unions said their members would refuse to serve on Concorde until the accident was explained. Etienne Lichtenburger, of the SPAC pilots' union, said: `No pilot will take up a Concorde until we have a clear account of what happened and what will be done about it.'</p> <p>No one has blamed Marty. `He had to face the worst poss-ible scenario,' said Germain Chambost, a former Concorde pilot. `He did what he could, but there was no way out for him.'</p> <p>Another Concorde pilot, answering questions from The Observer through an intermediary, said: `It could have been any of us. I am still in love with the plane, even if I don't want to fly right now. I keep thinking of him trying to keep control with two engines on fire. It could have been me. What was going through his mind in that minute? And what went through his mind when he knew he was going to die?'</p> <p>Gonesse was quiet yesterday. On Friday the town had held a silent march to commemorate the dead. Some 2,000 locals, relatives of the victims and Air France staff walked down the high street, past the industrial estates, through the fields and out to the crash site. They were led by the mayor, Jean-Pierre Blazy, and Mich\u00e9le Fricheteau, owner of the hotel. Blazy was angry in his grief, railing against British Airways' decision to keep their Concordes flying. Fricheteau just let the tears run down her face.</p> <p>Five hundred metres from the wreckage they halted and hung their heads. Overhead the engines of a 747 roared through the sky.</p> <p><b> Bottom of the safety league</b><br><br> Concorde's first fatal crash now puts the aircraft, statistically, at the bottom of the world safety league. The airliner had a superb 31-year crash-free record since its maiden flight in 1969 and entry into commercial service in 1976. Concorde's other incidents include:</p> <p>\u00951979 Air France plane has catastrophic tyre blow-out on take-off from Washington, damaging wing, fuel tank, engine.

A few years before he had completed the first crossing of the Atlantic on a sailboard. It had taken 37 days. He was a competition skier and a champion hang-glider too. `He was kind of intense,' said a friend. `He was a very dry, rigorous man.' It was in character for him to insist on the change. `He would never fly unless everything was 100 per cent,' the friend, a Concorde co-pilot, said. `He was a perfectionist. That's one of the reasons he was such a great pilot.' By 3.15 the pump had been replaced and Marty was satisfied. With co-pilot Jean Marcot, who had been flying Concordes for more than 10 years, and chief engineer, 58-year-old Gilles Jardinot, he started the pre-take-off checks. The six-strong cabin crew boarded the plane, and then the 100 passengers - including an American retired Air France employee who lived in Germany, an Austrian and two Danish tourists - filed up the mobile staircases and took their seats. It was 3.30. They had 15 minutes to live. From his desk on the third floor of Air France headquarters, Jean-Cyril Spinetta, the chief executive, watched the Concorde taxi on to the runway. For more than 10 minutes the plane sat on the tarmac. At 3.42 Marty was cleared for take-off and at 3.44 began to accelerate down runway 26. Then flames appeared under the left wing. Spinetta saw them from his executive suite. Ground staff beside the runway saw them and alerted the emergency services. The control tower saw them and hit the red crash button to alert the whole airport. Within seconds, as amateur photographers fired off frame after frame and lounges full of delayed passengers watched aghast, the burst of orange lengthened into a 30-metre stream of fire and black smoke. Perhaps the only people who couldn't see the blaze were the crew of the burning plane. But it is almost certain that they knew about it. Like all modern planes, Concorde has a range of systems to deal with fire in the engines. First a bell goes to warn the captain. He will usually shut off the noisy alarm and pull a fire handle on the ceiling of the cockpit above the windscreen to shut down the motor and cut off its fuel. A fire in one of Concorde's four engines should not cause too many problems. Three motors are enough to keep the plane airborne and allow the pilot, after dumping much of the 96 tonnes of aviation fuel, to look for an emergency landing site. As the front wheels lifted off the ground at 3.44.56 secs, the control tower radioed Marty to tell him they could see flames shooting from the plane. `Number two engine is out,' he said drily. But the plane was travelling at 250mph and had covered 4,200m of runway. It had reached V1 the speed at which it is considered impossible to abort a take-off safely. Though in hindsight it may have been a better option to take a risk, Marty followed the textbook procedure and pulled his stick back. The rear wheels left the ground. Flight AF 4590 was airborne. With a spout of flames and black smoke 40m long behind it. Within seconds Marty called the tower again. He was now having trouble with a second engine and reported that his undercarriage would not retract. Seconds later the pilot was on the radio again. He requested and was granted permission to try an emergency landing at Le Bourget airport, eight miles away, Spinetta watched the plane head south-west, leaving a thick line of oily smoke across the blue summer sky. It was only 100ft or so off the ground and had no thrust to gain altitude. Even that power was going. As the plane disappeared from view Spinetta quietly asked his secretary to get the Minister of Transport on the line. He had some bad news. Marc Olivier, a 24-year-old basketball player, was practising with friends in a park near his home near Gonesse when he heard the scream of Concorde's engines. They stopped playing and looked for the plane. For most people in Gonesse - a small, blue-collar town ringed by dual carriageways and industrial estates- the twice-daily flypasts by the world's most famous passenger plane are hardly something to get excited about. This time Concorde's approach sounded different. `You could hear the engines complaining as they tried to gain height,' Olivier told The Observer. `It was like they were screaming in pain.' The basketball players watched as the plane started to bank to the left and lose height. Describing a huge arc, it was soon almost facing back the way it had come. Its nose came up until it was almost vertical. Flames continued to spurt from its underside. `It started turning as if to avoid the town and then began swinging around and almost seemed to stand on end,' Olivier said. `The left wing was hitting the tops of the trees. Then the wing hit the ground and the plane flipped over and slid along the ground upside down, and then there were two explosions and everything disappeared in smoke and fire.' Marty, by design or accident, had avoided the main part of the town. The burning plane ploughed instead into a small hotel, the Hotelissimo, and exploded in a fireball `like an atomic bomb'. Five people were killed instantly: two young Polish women on a work experience programme were resting in their rooms, and a young Algerian maid who had been taken on the day before was making up beds with Devrance Chundursing, a 42- year-old Mauritian mother of two. The fifth body was found on Friday in the rubble under an engine. It was so badly burnt that identification of the sex was impossible. No one knows who it is. The death toll could have been much higher. A 21-year-old British student from Kent, Alice Brooking, was talking to her sister in London when the plane struck. She leapt through a first-floor window and suffered nothing more than minor burns and a bruised wrist. A bus-load of 44 teenagers, members of a Suffolk youth band, had been delayed by traffic. Their late arrival meant hotel manageress Mich\u00c1ele Ficheteau had given eight of her staff an extended break. Her secretary was out taking her dog for a walk. When the Concorde hit, the hotel eyewitnesses say it seemed to `vaporise'. Only a single charred wall remained upright. Within six minutes the emergency services were on the scene. There was little they could do other than play their hoses over the blazing wreckage. It was clear that no one could have survived in the plane. Early rumours of miraculous escapes were quickly proved optimistic. All 109 people on flight AF4590 died instantly. When the heat had subsided, rescue workers marked out the charred corpses and body parts with small plastic cones. Passengers at the airport were informed that `major problems' had forced a temporary halt of all flights. As stunned Air France staff wandered through the packed halls, news of the disaster quickly spread. In terminal T9, where the passengers had whiled away their wait with songs and card games, airport staff were in tears . `I was crying and crying,' said Marie Segal, a shop assistant. `I had watched all these people having fun. I had sold them newspapers and books for the flight. One told me how flying on Concorde was his life's ambition. He was so excited.' Yesterday investigators were still combing the jumbled wreckage for clues. The Air France Concorde fleet was still grounded. The press was still full of speculation. Two main investigations into the crash have been launched by French authorities. One is run by the Bureau Enqu\u00c2etes-Accidents (BEA), the official government aviation investigations unit whose duty is to ensure such an accident never happens again. The other is a judicial inquiry which aims to find out who, if anyone, should be charged with `involuntary manslaughter', a serious criminal offence. Usually a single magistrate is in charge. This inquiry has three. The scale of the judicial probe demonstrates both the gravity of the potential charges and the importance of some of the players in the tragedy. Senior staff at Air France, at the airport, even the Minister for Transport himself, are potentially personally liable under French law. There is a huge amount of data to work through. Just one of the two `black box' recorders contains 600 `parameters' which have to be analysed. Panels of experts including British, German and American specialists have been drafted in to help. By the end of last week an explanation was beginning to emerge. On Friday investigators from the BEA announced that one, and perhaps two, of the four tyres on the undercarriage under the left wing had exploded as the plane was racing down the runway. Those who know Concorde's history were immediately reminded of an incident more than 20 years earlier. In 1979 two tyres exploded on an Air France Concorde as it took off from Washington's Dulles airport. Pieces of the wheels' magnesium rims and other debris were sent smashing into the plane's body. A report by the American National Transport Safety Board, published two years later, revealed that `tyre debris and wheel shrapnel [had] resulted in damage to the No 2 engine, puncture of three fuel tanks, and severance of several hydraulic lines and electrical wires. Additionally, a large hole was torn in the top wing skin which covers the wheel well area.' The plane returned safely to Dulles, but pilots have always remembered the incident. `They were lucky,' said Patrick Augin, vice-president of France's largest pilots' union. 'It did not cause a fire in 1979, but it could have. It's just a matter of where the holes are.' As no debris from inside Flight AF4590's engines has been found on the runway investigators are playing down the idea that debris might have been sucked into the air intakes of its jets. Concorde is one of the few planes with air intakes situated directly behind its rear undercarriage. Experts point out that, with two huge intakes acting as giant hoovers, it is, whatever the BEA might say, unlikely that the motors themselves would have escaped unscathed. Any debris inside the engines would cause massive and immediate damage, dislodging dozens of the sharp turbine blades used to compress air. The blades in turn would act like shrapnel inside the engine, smashing it apart and slicing through power and fuel lines. They would also be likely to puncture the fuel tanks held in the wing and cut their way into the twin engine alongside. Just because investigators haven't found any parts from the engine on the runway does not mean they were unscathed when the plane crashed. Another possibility is that a wheel jammed and then burst. The undercarriage would then smash on to the runway. The impact would force it back up into the body of the plane, rupturing fuel lines. Once the thinly protected tanks in the wings or the fuel lines were damaged - by debris, or the undercarriage, or flying turbine blades- the leaking fluid would have been swiftly lit by a spark or chunk of hot metal. The burning fuel would be sprayed back by the airflow and the Rolls-Royce Olympus motors would have become huge flame-throwers. This would explain why, in the pictures of the stricken plane, the flames appear to originate from in front of the engines, though a plume of smoke and fire follows them. `Imagine a fireman's pressure hose squirting petrol across the mouth of a blast furnace and then multiply 100 or so times. It would have been so hot the metal of the plane itself would have been burning,' one former test pilot told The Observer. Another said the engines would have been converted into `giant cigarette lighters'. Aviation experts appear to have been concerned about the potential for such a disaster for some time. In 1982 the US Transportation Safety Board recommended - after several more incidents involving malfunction of tyres on the plane - that Concorde should be allowed to land at American airports only after a full inspection of wheels, tyres and landing gear before every flight. Two subsequent incidents, more than a year apart, prompted a mild rebuke of Air France for the ineffectiveness of its earlier directives implementing these recommendations. Pilots at British Airways, which operates seven Concordes, have long complained about the problem of burst tyres. With its fast take-off speed and sharp profile, Concorde is particularly hard on its undercarriage. On its first ever landing in America in 1976, engineers replaced a tyre which they felt was excessively worn. Some experts last week claimed that even a teaspoon left in its path could cause a blow-out. And the incidents appear to have recurred. At Heathrow in 1993 a burst tyre broke a glass-fibre water deflector and punctured a fuel tank. Earlier that year a tyre-burst due to brake seizure caused significant damage to a Concorde's engine, wing and hydraulics. The problem became so acute that BA installed a special alarm system in Concorde flight decks to alert the pilot on blow-out. Ever since its launch, experts have also worried about the plane's susceptibility to fire. A report by American fire specialists Blazetech written nearly 25 years ago mentions the vulnerability of Concorde to fires produced by catastrophic engine failures. It also appears that a British Aerospace report in 1976 raised concerns over the fire risk in Concorde's fuel tanks. A technical idiosyncrasy on Concorde explains why Marty was unaware of any blow-outs. When a tyre is faulty, a red light goes on in front of pilots - but only if Concorde is travelling at less than 150mph. At faster speeds it is impossible to stop, so the alarm is not activated. Marty had no idea what was happening underneath his plane. This explains why Marty attempted to raise the undercarriage - Air France's recommended procedure after a blow-out is to leave it down - after the plane took off. Implicit in British Airways' decision to continue flying Concorde is the accusation that it was poor management or maintenance that was responsible for the Paris tragedy. BA still clearly believes that the blame is not with the craft itself. `We wouldn't operate the aircraft if we thought it was unsafe,' a spokesman said. But the plane that crashed on Tuesday had undergone a 10-day inspection that ended on the Friday before the crash. And, with the rest of the Air France fleet, it had been given a complete refit, taking three months, last year. Nor can the company - still largely state-owned - be accused of cutting back on maintenance. Though costs have been slashed elsewhere to bring Air France into profit, Concorde has been seen as a symbol of national prestige and funded accordingly. Air France is refusing to answer technical questions about the crash. It has yet to confirm that the undercarriage and tyres were properly inspected before take-off. Nor is it yet clear if the repairs to the plane's engines, and particularly the fitting of the cannibalised thrust reverser minutes before take-off, were a factor in the crash. There are also serious questions over the condition of the runway. Was there an undetected flaw that caused a blow-out? Or maybe a rogue piece of uncleared detritus from the scores of flights that use the strip each day? The two technicians who fitted the equipment and many of the ground staff who maintained the strip were undergoing psychiatric counselling last week. BA's confidence in Concorde is not shared by Air France pilots. Some French unions said their members would refuse to serve on Concorde until the accident was explained. Etienne Lichtenburger, of the SPAC pilots' union, said: `No pilot will take up a Concorde until we have a clear account of what happened and what will be done about it.' No one has blamed Marty. `He had to face the worst poss-ible scenario,' said Germain Chambost, a former Concorde pilot. `He did what he could, but there was no way out for him.' Another Concorde pilot, answering questions from The Observer through an intermediary, said: `It could have been any of us. I am still in love with the plane, even if I don't want to fly right now. I keep thinking of him trying to keep control with two engines on fire. It could have been me. What was going through his mind in that minute? And what went through his mind when he knew he was going to die?' Gonesse was quiet yesterday. On Friday the town had held a silent march to commemorate the dead. Some 2,000 locals, relatives of the victims and Air France staff walked down the high street, past the industrial estates, through the fields and out to the crash site. They were led by the mayor, Jean-Pierre Blazy, and Mich\u00e9le Fricheteau, owner of the hotel. Blazy was angry in his grief, railing against British Airways' decision to keep their Concordes flying. Fricheteau just let the tears run down her face. Five hundred metres from the wreckage they halted and hung their heads. Overhead the engines of a 747 roared through the sky. Bottom of the safety league Concorde's first fatal crash now puts the aircraft, statistically, at the bottom of the world safety league. The airliner had a superb 31-year crash-free record since its maiden flight in 1969 and entry into commercial service in 1976. Concorde's other incidents include: \u00951979 Air France plane has catastrophic tyre blow-out on take-off from Washington, damaging wing, fuel tank, engine. BA tyre blows out on take-off from Heathrow. \u00951989 Damage to BA plane's rudder in flight. 1991 BA plane's rudder breaks up at 56,000ft. \u00951993 BA plane's tyre blow-out at Heathrow causes fuel leak. \u00951994 Report reveals outer window panels crack at Mach 2. Safety checks ordered. \u00951998 BA plane turns back to Heathrow after panel falls off wing. Part of rudder falls off another BA aircraft in mid-flight. \u0095February 2000 Engine failure as BA plane approaches Heathrow. \u009523 July 2000 BA and Air France report finding 2.5in cracks in the wings of all Concordes.",

MDC president Morgan Tsvangirai said urban workers decided to take action in solidarity with farm workers living under constant fear of losing their lives or jobs. `Workers are being beaten up. How do you expect them to be productive under such conditions?' he said. He also warned that the protests by the farmers must not be misconstrued as a fight against land redistribution, but for a peaceful and just process. Jonathan Moyo, Mugabe's new Minister of Information, alleged the strike had been hatched by white farmers who were trying to hang on to the land stolen from the African people during the colonial era. `Government has expeditiously responded through the police, who have also put in place adequate security arrangements wherever need has been demonstrated,' he said. But Tendai Biti, the MDC's secretary for agriculture, denounced `the haphazard manner' in which the Mugabe government had dealt with the land issue. `It has resulted in the current chaos on commercial farms,' he said. `The government must move swiftly to restore the rule of law and remove land occupiers from the farms, pending implementation of a proper process.' The MDC proposes a land commission composed of all stakeholders, to make proposals for a coherent, sustainable land reform process.",

      "body": "<p>Democratically speaking, Britain is in a shameful mess over the single currency and, indeed, its future role in the European Union. This is partly the result of prolonged attempts by governments to manipulate opinion. The public is disaffected and mistrustful. Our arranged marriage with the Common Market of 1973 has dwindled into loveless cohabitation. Assertions about the desirability of continued political and economic integration by those who welcome that prospect are as unconvincing to the sceptics as were the assurances given to Little Red Riding Hood.</p> <p>We understood the original 'democratic deficit', but 27 years later the gap has become a gulf. Today, the ignorance is as profound as ever and is energised by resentment. Few know the name of their MEP or have much sense of belonging to, or ownership of, the so-called union.</p> <p>Not a quarter of the electorate was moved to vote in the May 1999 European elections, partly because the electoral system, where one could only vote for a party, was rightly seen as a cynical fix. The EU Commission's latest Eurobarometer (a six-monthly, cross-community, mass opinion survey) shows that support here for the single currency is down to 22 per cent with only 25 per cent thinking our membership is 'a good thing'. What business or institution with a comparable 27-year record would still be around to be able to continue peddling its still unfulfilled claims?</p> <p>The British hate being misled and patronised, of which there are few worse instances in our entire history than the endless pretence that the single currency is merely an economic matter. The Government knows full well that most people are genuinely worried about the broader political and cultural implications. Very occasionally, Ministers will acknowledge that, but only then on the basis, as the Prime Minister put it in the House of Commons on 21 June, that the non-economic issues have been 'resolved by the Government'. Thanks!</p> <p>Year by year since 1973, a nation which, in the last world war had to call on every ounce of patriotism for its very survival, has seen control of its own affairs pooled in Europe. Most people have experienced a steady loss of political power and control of their lives.</p> <p>This has led to the political equivalent of what psychologists call 'learned helplessness', which has, in turn, contributed to what Betty Boothroyd on Wednesday described as the growing cynicism and alienation of voters. It is a syndrome which leads to civic passivity and disengagement and even to a sense of subjection.</p> <p>The metropolitan riposte is that national sovereignty is anyhow bound to go on diminishing (as if one is less keen to hang on to what one has because it is so little). The chiding is often accompanied by the 'more fool you' rebuke that `ever closer union' is written into the Treaty of Rome, and that we should all have read the small print. No wonder `ordinary' people feel conspired against.</p> <p>What also causes deep offence to the multitude who doubt the wisdom of fur ther political union is the charge that they are being faint hearted or simply playing the little Englander.</p> <p>Rather, some say, the ones lacking moral fibre are those who can't face the challenge of standing apart from the single currency and fast-track convergence. Both points of view have more than their fair share of caricature but sadly there is little middle ground. What is certainly true is that for very many of those hostile to further integration, love of their country is a powerful impulse. It crosses class divides. That patriotism, scoffed at by the sophisticates, finds little outlet in Europe. Rather, too many Euro-initiatives seem insensitive to those idiosyncratic, familiar things which are so valued by 'the little battalions'.</p> <p>This strand of antipathy to Europe may be coalescing around the general countryside 'revolt', which is also bound up with the preservation of traditional and peculiarly English aspects of life (hunting or the WI, for example) which are felt - often wrongly - to be under threat from the EU, with its endless change and homogenisation. There may even be a developing sense of mismatch between it and faith communities which tend to be independent and conservative. There is in all this more than a touch of the old Reformation attitudes towards this modern Rome.</p> <p>Europe has also become part of the social exclusion problem in that the dynamic minority for whom it presents a real opportunity are, by their preoccupying involvement with Europe, likely to become even more detached from home problems which need their care if they are to have any prospect of resolution. That is undoubtedly exacerbated by the new capitalism and growing earnings divide.</p> <p>One must say, too, that for a government which consults at the drop of a hat, big European issues have been bizarrely ignored. The Tories were no better and the EU has been a remarkably ineffective populariser of its own affairs. Meanwhile, the problems of impersonality, uniformity and vaunting complication get ever worse. As one small indication, last week's Parliamentary 'EEC papers' itemise 103 publications for us to choose from. These do not include the gusher of EU laws, which last year took up 10 feet of shelf space.</p> <p>All this is inseparable from seeking to govern a continent of disparate countries. It is creating a world fit mainly for lawyers. Its bulimic regime encourages rejection via growing corruption (the invariable response to over-regulation), bureaucratic stasis and arbitrariness of implementation. All of this fuels yet more regulation.</p> <p>If there is a way of redeeming the present self-defeating disgrace, it must start with honesty within and across the political parties. Imaginative attempts must be made to give everyone, however unsophisticated, the chance to take part in what must become a great debate. That process should start now, properly and fairly financed, ending with a referendum after the next general election. It would do wonders for its efficacy if it was, like the 1975 one, cross-party, thus drawing in the huge majority who have no fixed political abode. Such a referendum could just about save the day, so that its result will be right, whichever way it goes. <b> Lord Phillips of Sudbury is a solicitor and life peer.</b></p>",

      "bodyText": "Democratically speaking, Britain is in a shameful mess over the single currency and, indeed, its future role in the European Union. This is partly the result of prolonged attempts by governments to manipulate opinion. The public is disaffected and mistrustful. Our arranged marriage with the Common Market of 1973 has dwindled into loveless cohabitation. Assertions about the desirability of continued political and economic integration by those who welcome that prospect are as unconvincing to the sceptics as were the assurances given to Little Red Riding Hood. We understood the original 'democratic deficit', but 27 years later the gap has become a gulf. Today, the ignorance is as profound as ever and is energised by resentment. Few know the name of their MEP or have much sense of belonging to, or ownership of, the so-called union. Not a quarter of the electorate was moved to vote in the May 1999 European elections, partly because the electoral system, where one could only vote for a party, was rightly seen as a cynical fix. The EU Commission's latest Eurobarometer (a six-monthly, cross-community, mass opinion survey) shows that support here for the single currency is down to 22 per cent with only 25 per cent thinking our membership is 'a good thing'. What business or institution with a comparable 27-year record would still be around to be able to continue peddling its still unfulfilled claims? The British hate being misled and patronised, of which there are few worse instances in our entire history than the endless pretence that the single currency is merely an economic matter. The Government knows full well that most people are genuinely worried about the broader political and cultural implications. Very occasionally, Ministers will acknowledge that, but only then on the basis, as the Prime Minister put it in the House of Commons on 21 June, that the non-economic issues have been 'resolved by the Government'. Thanks! Year by year since 1973, a nation which, in the last world war had to call on every ounce of patriotism for its very survival, has seen control of its own affairs pooled in Europe. Most people have experienced a steady loss of political power and control of their lives. This has led to the political equivalent of what psychologists call 'learned helplessness', which has, in turn, contributed to what Betty Boothroyd on Wednesday described as the growing cynicism and alienation of voters. It is a syndrome which leads to civic passivity and disengagement and even to a sense of subjection. The metropolitan riposte is that national sovereignty is anyhow bound to go on diminishing (as if one is less keen to hang on to what one has because it is so little). The chiding is often accompanied by the 'more fool you' rebuke that `ever closer union' is written into the Treaty of Rome, and that we should all have read the small print. No wonder `ordinary' people feel conspired against. What also causes deep offence to the multitude who doubt the wisdom of fur ther political union is the charge that they are being faint hearted or simply playing the little Englander. Rather, some say, the ones lacking moral fibre are those who can't face the challenge of standing apart from the single currency and fast-track convergence. Both points of view have more than their fair share of caricature but sadly there is little middle ground. What is certainly true is that for very many of those hostile to further integration, love of their country is a powerful impulse. It crosses class divides. That patriotism, scoffed at by the sophisticates, finds little outlet in Europe. Rather, too many Euro-initiatives seem insensitive to those idiosyncratic, familiar things which are so valued by 'the little battalions'. This strand of antipathy to Europe may be coalescing around the general countryside 'revolt', which is also bound up with the preservation of traditional and peculiarly English aspects of life (hunting or the WI, for example) which are felt - often wrongly - to be under threat from the EU, with its endless change and homogenisation. There may even be a developing sense of mismatch between it and faith communities which tend to be independent and conservative. There is in all this more than a touch of the old Reformation attitudes towards this modern Rome. Europe has also become part of the social exclusion problem in that the dynamic minority for whom it presents a real opportunity are, by their preoccupying involvement with Europe, likely to become even more detached from home problems which need their care if they are to have any prospect of resolution. That is undoubtedly exacerbated by the new capitalism and growing earnings divide. One must say, too, that for a government which consults at the drop of a hat, big European issues have been bizarrely ignored. The Tories were no better and the EU has been a remarkably ineffective populariser of its own affairs. Meanwhile, the problems of impersonality, uniformity and vaunting complication get ever worse. As one small indication, last week's Parliamentary 'EEC papers' itemise 103 publications for us to choose from. These do not include the gusher of EU laws, which last year took up 10 feet of shelf space. All this is inseparable from seeking to govern a continent of disparate countries. It is creating a world fit mainly for lawyers. Its bulimic regime encourages rejection via growing corruption (the invariable response to over-regulation), bureaucratic stasis and arbitrariness of implementation. All of this fuels yet more regulation. If there is a way of redeeming the present self-defeating disgrace, it must start with honesty within and across the political parties. Imaginative attempts must be made to give everyone, however unsophisticated, the chance to take part in what must become a great debate. That process should start now, properly and fairly financed, ending with a referendum after the next general election. It would do wonders for its efficacy if it was, like the 1975 one, cross-party, thus drawing in the huge majority who have no fixed political abode. Such a referendum could just about save the day, so that its result will be right, whichever way it goes. Lord Phillips of Sudbury is a solicitor and life peer.",

It is frightening what the police will be able to do without having to go before a judge.

Under the RIP Act, the authorities will be able to bypass the phone companies.</p> <p>The mobile phone companies believe these new location facilities in their products will be hugely popular because they will allow users to find the nearest bank or Indian takeaway, and then get precise directions to the restaurant.

      "bodyText": "Police are to be given new powers to track people using satellite technology that can pick up signals emitted from mobile phones. In a move denounced as sinister by civil liberties campaigners, software being fitted into the new generation of mobiles will enable police to pinpoint the exact whereabouts of a person whenever the phone is switched on. But privacy campaigners fear the police could use the new phones as homing devices that will allow them to carry out mass surveillance without those targeted knowing about it One campaigner likened it to putting an `electronic tag' on large swathes of the population. The Government and the police say the powers are needed to fight certain crimes, including drug trafficking. They believe the technology will guide paramedics and firefighters to the locations of emergencies. These unprecedented powers are part of the Regulatory of Investigatory Powers Bill which received Royal Assent on Friday. They will allow the security services to intercept private emails. Privacy campaigners and Opposition peers urged the Government to ensure that the read-outs of physical location produced by the new mobile phones should be made available only after a warrant is obtained from a judge. But the appeals were rebuffed. The police will be able to track somebody's movements on the authority of a police superintendent. Caspar Bowden, who runs the Foundation for Information Policy Reseach, the internet policy think-tank which brought these concerns to light, last night expressed alarm over the move. `Anyone using the new phones will be able to be tracked with pinpoint accuracy at the click of a mouse, for very broad purposes,' he said. `It's like putting an electronic tag on most of the population.' John Wadham, of the civil liberties group Liberty, said: `This technology is of great concern, and the legislation is simply not keeping up with it. It is frightening what the police will be able to do without having to go before a judge. Under the Act, the only authority overseeing these capabilities will come from an Interception Commissioner, who does not have to be notified pro-actively of their use, or whether tracking data is passed between government departments once acquired. Currently, police can obtain information about where a call was made from a specific mobile, if they can satisfy telephone operators there is sufficient evidence for their suspicions. Under the RIP Act, the authorities will be able to bypass the phone companies. The mobile phone companies believe these new location facilities in their products will be hugely popular because they will allow users to find the nearest bank or Indian takeaway, and then get precise directions to the restaurant. The companies also believe it will give callers greater security knowing that the emergency services can track them down in a crisis. A spokeswoman for Vodafone said: `It is true that under this new Act the police will not have to get our approval to access this information any more. But we believe the new software in the phones will bring many benefits to our customers and will be warmly welcomed.' The National Criminal Intelligence Service denied that the new technology would mean the age of mass surveillance in this country . A spokeswoman said: `We will not speculate about how police will use technology that does not yet exist. But we will still be governed by Data Protection Act and believe the RIP bill has strengthened the rights of individuals, not weakened it. antony.barnett@observer.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>Last week's government announcement on the future of long-term care contained good news for some, but thousands of elderly people will be worse off as a result. The proposals pave the way for higher charges for those who receive some assistance in their own homes. </p> <p>The good news is that an estimated 35,000 people in nursing homes will get state funding for the nursing care part of their fees. There will also be much greater emphasis on rehabilitation, with an extra \u00a3900 million to be spent on rehab by 2004. </p> <p>'There will be real benefits here for someone who has broken a hip, for instance, and wants therapy and extra nursing care to restore their confidence and mobility after the operation,' says Tessa Harding of Help the Aged. </p> <p>On nursing care costs, the Government estimates that people in nursing homes 'could save up to around \u00a35,000 for a year's stay in a nursing home'. </p> <p>A long-awaited paper published by the Department of Health last week, 'The NHS Plan - the Government's response to the Royal Commission on Long Term Care', states: 'There can be no justification for charging people in care homes for their nursing costs.' </p> <p>It is establishing a principle that no one - whether in hospital, in a home or in their own home - should pay for nursing care. </p> <p>The flipside is the Government's stance that people should pay for 'personal care' - the costs of providing meals on wheels, for instance, helping people get dressed or perhaps keeping a watchful eye on someone who suffers from dementia. </p> <p>Ministers have rejected proposals from the Royal Commission that residents in homes have all their 'personal care' costs met. </p> <p>It is another small but logical step for the Government to suggest that people receiving personal care at home should pay for this themselves. In fact, last week's announcement included the information that 'statutory guidance on home care charges' will be issued to local authorities by next April at the latest. </p> <p>'There could be swings and roundabouts in this,' says Harding. 'You could find that those local authorities which currently do not charge very much for these services fall below what the Government recommends in its guidelines.' </p> <p>Peter Gatenby of Age Concern Financial Partnerships says: 'At the moment, lots of local authorities charge, but they don't end up collecting the money. This move could mean more services are charged for by more authorities.

      "bodyText": "Last week's government announcement on the future of long-term care contained good news for some, but thousands of elderly people will be worse off as a result. The proposals pave the way for higher charges for those who receive some assistance in their own homes. The good news is that an estimated 35,000 people in nursing homes will get state funding for the nursing care part of their fees. There will also be much greater emphasis on rehabilitation, with an extra \u00a3900 million to be spent on rehab by 2004. 'There will be real benefits here for someone who has broken a hip, for instance, and wants therapy and extra nursing care to restore their confidence and mobility after the operation,' says Tessa Harding of Help the Aged. On nursing care costs, the Government estimates that people in nursing homes 'could save up to around \u00a35,000 for a year's stay in a nursing home'. A long-awaited paper published by the Department of Health last week, 'The NHS Plan - the Government's response to the Royal Commission on Long Term Care', states: 'There can be no justification for charging people in care homes for their nursing costs.' It is establishing a principle that no one - whether in hospital, in a home or in their own home - should pay for nursing care. The flipside is the Government's stance that people should pay for 'personal care' - the costs of providing meals on wheels, for instance, helping people get dressed or perhaps keeping a watchful eye on someone who suffers from dementia. Ministers have rejected proposals from the Royal Commission that residents in homes have all their 'personal care' costs met. It is another small but logical step for the Government to suggest that people receiving personal care at home should pay for this themselves. In fact, last week's announcement included the information that 'statutory guidance on home care charges' will be issued to local authorities by next April at the latest. 'There could be swings and roundabouts in this,' says Harding. 'You could find that those local authorities which currently do not charge very much for these services fall below what the Government recommends in its guidelines.' Peter Gatenby of Age Concern Financial Partnerships says: 'At the moment, lots of local authorities charge, but they don't end up collecting the money. This move could mean more services are charged for by more authorities. They will be looking to charge commercial rates.' Research conducted by the Audit Commission and published in May found that 94 per cent of councils charge for personal care. But charges for the same service - say helping someone get out of bed and have a bath - could vary from \u00a35 a week in one area to \u00a3150 in another. Although the statutory guidance will make the charging procedures more consistent, it will not necessarily make them cheaper. Campaigners for the elderly were astonished at the lack of further support for people in nursing and residential homes. The cost to the Government of paying the nursing care element could be as little as \u00a330m a year - a tenth of the amount of money that is being put into developing banks in post offices, for instance. Campaigners are puzzled that so little should be going to the elderly residents of homes at a time when the economy is buoyant enough for public expenditure to be increased by \u00a343 billion in this month's comprehensive spending review. Harry Cayton of the Alzheimer's Society was 'very disappointed' by the proposals and the 'narrow definition' which the Government plans to put on nursing care. It is clear that nursing costs will include the payment of wages to registered nurses, the dispensing of drugs and the application of dressings. But the country's 700,000 dementia sufferers could find that little of their nursing home fees are deemed to be for nursing care. 'We will have to fight very hard on the definition of nursing care,' says Cayton. Help the Aged will be writing to Ministers expressing 'devastating disappointment' over the plans, and the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux is to urge Ministers to increase the \u00a315.45 weekly 'pocket money' which residents of homes are allowed. Members of the Royal Commission were last week said to be 'extremely upset' at the Government's response to their proposals. There will be some other measures aimed at sugaring the pill, however.

From October 2001, councils will be encouraged to give loans to people who do not want to sell their own family home immediately when they go into care. But this will provide just a temporary reprieve: at some stage their house will have to be sold. In a further move, the Treasury is to consult this autumn on the desirability of regulating the sale of long-term care insurance plans - further tacit recognition that the Labour party now supports the growth of the private sector in funding the cost of long-term care. \u0095 Copies of the proposals are available from the Department of Health, PO Box 777, London SE1 6XH, by fax on 01623 724524 or by email at doh@prolog.uk.com.

One of her regrets is that she didn't take her pension more seriously when she was younger. Although she paid into the NHS pension scheme when she first started nursing, she says she 'foolishly' took a refund of her contributions when she stopped work to have children. The money was not wasted - she and her husband used it as a deposit to buy a home - but it has left her with less of a pension . </p> <p>After having her two children, Andrew, now 21, and Jane, 19, Diane returned to part-time nursing but did not start contributing to an NHS pension again until 10 years ago. </p> <p>The family's finances have been stretched recently. Diane's husband Peter, 49, had to take ill-health retirement four years ago because he suffers from Parkinson's disease. He receives a modest pension but the past year, with both children at university, was difficult. Andrew graduated this year and is liv ing at home again while he looks for a permanent job. Jane has another three years of study. Although she has taken student loans, these cannot meet all her needs. Her parents pay her rent of \u00a3200 a month during term time, plus another \u00a3160 towards her keep. </p> <p>Diane is not sure how long she can keep working as her husband's health is deteriorating; she feels she may have to give up her job by the time she is in her mid-fifties in order to look after him. </p> <p>So she wants to boost her pension now and wonders if she should buy 'added years' or not. She explains: 'I have been told I can buy back four added years of superannuation at \u00a3187 a month.' This would boost her pension at age 55 from \u00a35,064 a year plus a lump sum of \u00a315,194, to \u00a36,483 a year plus \u00a319,541. She hopes she will be able to work until age 58, as this is when the couple's mortgage is due to be paid off. </p> <p>On the savings front, Diane and Peter have \u00a34,000 each in a Tessa, which is money from Peter's retirement lump sum. A further \u00a31,000 was placed in another building society, account, which is coming up to maturity. Diane is considering using that money to top up the Tessas. </p> <p>She also has \u00a3500 in an ordinary savings account with Bradford &amp; Bingley. She has two savings policies with the Royal National Pension Fund for Nurses, for \u00a320 a month each, and is also trying to pay \u00a350 a month into a mini cash Isa, so she can help Jane pay off her student loans when she graduates. </p> <p>Her \u00a33,000 three-year car loan has two years to run.

      "body": "<p>Another week, another fiasco in the insurance industry. This time, the problem is Axa's scheme to distribute 'orphan assets' - surplus profits whose ownership is unclear. </p> <p>The row revolves around the proportion of the assets built up over years being distributed to shareholders, versus the share going to policyholders. The Consumers' Association claims the policyholders are getting a raw deal - receiving, at best, 55 per cent of the \u00a31.7 billion, and perhaps as little as 35 per cent. </p> <p>But one of the difficulties is the complexity of the scheme; the CA cannot make a final estimate without more information. </p> <p>Policyholders must choose between a one-off payment averaging \u00a3400 now - most will get less than \u00a31,000 - plus a larger final bonus when their policies mature, or to forgo the one-off money in return for a possibly larger return in future. </p> <p>But there are no guarantees, so the temptation will be to go for jam today, even if policyholders' share of the pot is too thin. </p> <p>The CA is right to question the deal, even if only because it is too complicated for policyholders to assess for themselves. They have until 16 October to make up their minds, and should be in no rush to say yes. </p> <p>The row underlines the shortcomings of the with-profits method of investment, where all the deci sions about how much profit is distributed are made by insurance company directors behind closed doors. This is fine in theory, but the execution is proving tortuous, and policyholders cannot judge whether they are being offered a good deal. </p> <p>Often the misjudgment - or miserliness - of directors becomes clear too late for policyholders to put up a fight. In future, investors may judge that they would do better taking their chances with a direct investment in the stock market. </p> <p>Halifax is contacting mortgage customers paying its standard rate - a sky-high 7.74 per cent - inviting them to switch to lower-cost loans. It is a laudable move in an industry that has got fat by allowing existing customers to subsidise the cheaper deals of new ones. </p> <p>But if Halifax was serious about helping longstanding clients, it would simply cut its standard rate. It is revealing, perhaps, that only 10 per cent of those approached so far have swapped.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Another week, another fiasco in the insurance industry. This time, the problem is Axa's scheme to distribute 'orphan assets' - surplus profits whose ownership is unclear. The row revolves around the proportion of the assets built up over years being distributed to shareholders, versus the share going to policyholders. The Consumers' Association claims the policyholders are getting a raw deal - receiving, at best, 55 per cent of the \u00a31.7 billion, and perhaps as little as 35 per cent. But one of the difficulties is the complexity of the scheme; the CA cannot make a final estimate without more information. Policyholders must choose between a one-off payment averaging \u00a3400 now - most will get less than \u00a31,000 - plus a larger final bonus when their policies mature, or to forgo the one-off money in return for a possibly larger return in future. But there are no guarantees, so the temptation will be to go for jam today, even if policyholders' share of the pot is too thin. The CA is right to question the deal, even if only because it is too complicated for policyholders to assess for themselves. They have until 16 October to make up their minds, and should be in no rush to say yes. The row underlines the shortcomings of the with-profits method of investment, where all the deci sions about how much profit is distributed are made by insurance company directors behind closed doors. This is fine in theory, but the execution is proving tortuous, and policyholders cannot judge whether they are being offered a good deal. Often the misjudgment - or miserliness - of directors becomes clear too late for policyholders to put up a fight. In future, investors may judge that they would do better taking their chances with a direct investment in the stock market. Halifax is contacting mortgage customers paying its standard rate - a sky-high 7.74 per cent - inviting them to switch to lower-cost loans. It is a laudable move in an industry that has got fat by allowing existing customers to subsidise the cheaper deals of new ones. But if Halifax was serious about helping longstanding clients, it would simply cut its standard rate. It is revealing, perhaps, that only 10 per cent of those approached so far have swapped.",

For holiday claims (where fraud is common), insurers want claims handlers to check all claims thoroughly before deciding. Some claims handlers employ overseas agents to check up on policyholders, perhaps making sure the theft was reported to police or that a receipt is genuine. If you are not happy with the way a claims handler is dealing with your claim, or you disagree with the reasons for rejection, you can contact the insurer directly. Most insurer will be loth to second- guess the handler's decision, but the insurer still must respond. Claims handlers are paid by the insurance companies under contract and want to keep insurers happy. One way could be to restrict amounts paid out in claims. But while insurers want to avoid paying invalid claims, they do not want to upset customers unnecessarily. A safeguard for policyholders is claims handlers' awareness that too many justifiable complaints mean the end of their contract.",

So how, given the news that the latest nationwide housing boom has come to a somewhat abrupt end, should we be feeling now? </p> <p>If you have bought in the last 12 months, you have every right to feel a little cheesed off, as you may have assumed that your property would be worth some 15 per cent more in a year's time. If you have bought in London and some other parts of the country that had seen prices shooting higher, you may be doubly cheesed off by the realisation that your newly purchased property may actually be worth less than this time next year. </p> <p>But if you are thinking of moving, and are already sitting on big gains on your current property, or if you are a prospective first-time buyer, then you should be greatly relieved that property prices have gone into decline or steadied across the country. It is also good news for those on a variable rate mortgage, as the chances of further rate rises diminish in a stable housing market. </p> <p>Fears of a repeat of the 1989-90 debacle should not be given too much space to grow. Circumstances are now very different, and a 0.4 per cent month-on-month fall in prices, as reported by the Halifax in June, should not inspire fear or despair in even the most nervous houseowner. Now, unlike then, the economy as a whole is fairly sound. Moreover, in large parts of the country, particularly the North, prices are still rising. </p> <p>Still, too much optimism would not be appropriate. It is normal for house prices to start to fall in London and the South and for the rest of the country to follow. And the national picture is that the slowdown is genuine if not dramatic. The Halifax's fall in June was the fourth in five months, and it takes the annual rate of house price inflation to 9.2 per cent, down from a peak of 16 per cent in January. By contrast, the Nationwide's most recent data showed that house prices actually rose 0.4 per cent in June to an average of \u00a381,452, but that followed a 0.3 per cent decline in May, suggesting that prices are generally stable. Statistics, for July are due from Nationwide this week. The building society itself did not interpret the June rise as a sign of market buoyancy. </p> <p>'We believe that house price inflation has been running at an unsustainable pace in the past year and it was natural and expected that some slowing would take place,' a spokesman for the Nationwide said. Both the Halifax and the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors have highlighted a slowdown in London as a key factor in the national steadying. The Royal Institution said last week that, for the three months to June, 'the slowdown in price inflation at national level disguises wide regional variations. In London prices actually declined for the first time since 1998.' Jeremy Leaf, who is spokesman for the RICS and runs an estate agent business in north London, said: 'In some cases people have had to take small cuts in price because there are no longer queues for each property.' All in all, he believes, 'it is a more balanced market.' </p> <p>The slowing in pace of annual house price inflation is being painted as something of a triumph for sound management of the economy. Four interest rate rises between September last year and this February, plus the final abolition of Miras in April, all undoubtedly contributed to the situation. But equally important was that in some areas, particularly London and the South-east, house prices had simply got ridiculously, off-puttingly high. 'No one wants to be known as the person who bought at the top of the market,' one estate agent said. Even Madonna complained bitterly about London prices before shelling out \u00a310.5 million on a four-storey property near Harrods in June, perilously close to the market peak. </p> <p>While 'affordability' has remained at a reasonable level nationally, with the average house costing 3.6 times average earnings, close to the historical norm, in London, the ratio had reached 4.7 times in the first quarter. Although London is traditionally less affordable than the country as a whole, this was a historically high level and it meant that first-time buyers have been unable to purchase in the capital. Relatively few people have been willing to overstretch themselves with 100 per cent mortgages and borrowings from family. Unlike the late-1980s, there is no longer the faith that property prices will always rise when you want them to, there are far fewer tax benefits to buying, and, importantly, recent graduates are quite likely to be carrying several thousand pounds of debt. </p> <p>One feature of the recent housing boom is that it has been very regional; some areas have not had price rises, while some have been on a par with central London. In Edinburgh's Georgian West End and New Town, for example, property prices have risen dramatically, fuelled to some extent by Londoners in the financial services industry moving north of the border. In nearby Glasgow prices have been far calmer. With London and the South-east now the fastest to slow down, the rest of the country has had a chance to do some catching up. </p> <p>The latest RICS survey backs up reports from others, such as the Bradford &amp; Bingley estate agents, in claiming that house sales are speeding up in the North of England while they are steady or falling in the South. The RICS survey found prices falling in London, a slowdown in the East Midlands, East Anglia, the South-east, South-west and North-west, and rises in Yorkshire, Humberside and the West Midlands. </p> <p>In the next few months psychology will play as large a part in the development of house prices as supply and demand. Traditionally, many people put their houses on the market in the early autumn. Unless August brings a huge reversal in recent trends, those prospective buyers will be fully aware that prices are starting to come down. Estate agents are saying that sellers may have to take slightly lower offers to get moved before Christmas. If this scenario is played out, it should lead to further pressure on prices, but no rout. </p> <p>As Martin Ellis, the Halifax's economist, puts it: 'Our view is that prices should steady. There has already been a bit of a correction, but the fundamentals are very different to the late Eighties and early Nineties. Unemployment is continuing to fall, interest rates are near their peak and affordability is near its average.' </p> <p>And he reminds the faint-hearted of the advantages of investing in the housing market: 'Property tends to rise broadly in line with average earnings, which is 1.5 to 2 per cent above retail price inflation. That accumulates a nice little return over time.'</p> <p><strong>Buy to let - and let the profits roll in </strong></p> <p>Ashley and Jo Seager are about to add two more flats in London to their property portfolio.

Instead they stayed overseas, and let the flat. </p> <p>When they returned in 1996 they had small children and needed more space.

It goes as follows: step one: moan about how many of the photos are a) out of focus or b) have the 'red eye' effect, which makes everyone look like the living dead; step two: question whether taking 23 shots of the inside of your apartment was really necessary; step three: wish you had removed the lens cap on several occasions; and, step four: return to the store to obtain the few reprints you think are good enough to send to friends and family. A palaver. </p> <p>But this post-holiday ritual may not last much longer. A raft of online 'e-photo' firms are competing via the internet to process your photographs, and save you time and money. </p> <p>The e-photo industry which, inevitably, started life in the US, works like this. You send off your film in a freepost envelope obtained via the web or from a store. The e-photo company then scans the photos and emails you a web address where you can look at the snaps. </p> <p>You choose the ones you want printed and email them to friends so that they can order their own copies. The company then posts the prints and the negatives. </p> <p>Most firms in this field scan the films free, and charge only for the prints you order. There are various degrees of privacy, so users can if they wish bar other people from looking at their photographs. </p> <p>And, because all the online technology allows for interactivity, you can do lots of clever things, such as compile albums of your snaps, choose different borders and captions and, in some cases, touch up the photos to get rid of, say, that annoying red eye. Customers can also have their snaps printed on to everything from T-shirts to mouse pads to mugs. </p> <p>'This will be the biggest event in the photographic print industry since the launch of 35mm film,' said Ernie Gilburd of easyMemories.com, an e-photo firm soon to be launched in the UK. </p> <p>Well Gilburd, who until recently headed Minit UK, the firm which owns SupaSnaps, would say that wouldn't he? However, he does join a long list of very big names who are betting on the same hunch. </p> <p>In the US, Jim Clark, founder of Netscape, has backed <a href=\"http://www.Shutterfly.com\" target=\"_new\">Shutterfly.com</a>, which is owned by internet investment giant CMGi; the sector's second-largest firm, <a href=\"http://www.ememories.com\" target=\"_new\">ememories.com</a>, is supported by the likes of Goldman Sachs, Disney and George Soros. Jim Barksdale, Netscape's former chief executive, is an investor in ofoto.com, the third-largest e-photo business. </p> <p>Now the giant of film processors is interested. Last week Kodak, which in 1999 had sales of more than $14 billion and can't afford to see its market dominance threatened, took a stake in ememories to complement its earlier investment in <a href=\"http://www.snapfish.com\" target=\"_new\">snapfish.com</a>. </p> <p>In the UK Boots, which processes twice as many films as its nearest rival, will launch its own e -photo service, <a href=\"http://www.bootsphoto.com\" target=\"_new\">bootsphoto.com</a>, within the next two weeks. Photo-Me International, the company behind the booths at train stations is also launching a service. </p> <p>Evangelists for the new industry point to synergies between the internet and photography. 'This sort of service uses a real internet business model,' said Cameron Crockett, a founder of ideaShed, the internet incubator behind easyMemories. 'It's visual and it's light. It's easy for people to see and the service is available to everyone.' easyMemories claims its processing prices will be cheaper than in the high street. Crockett believes the business is adaptable to digitising and distributing both audio and video footage. </p> <p>So how big is the e-photo industry going to be? Wildly conflicting estimates show just how immature this industry is. According to analysts at Infotrends Technology Group, sales of prints developed by online firms will be worth more than $2.5 billion in 2005, compared with $20 million last year. Lyra, the photography research firm, suggests that in Asia and the Pacific Rim e-photo services will be worth nearly $650m in 2002. </p> <p>Crockett argues that the internet will expand the photography market. 'When APS technology [the new sort of film which makes it easier to index your prints] came out, the number of reprints as a percentage of sales went up. With these new e-photo services, in just three clicks everybody's got the index to your photos.' </p> <p>Similarly, he believes that the rise in the number of digital cameras will not threaten the e-photo firms: they will still make their money from printing the snaps, even if they no longer have to process them. </p> <p>In fact companies such as Zing.com, the market leader, are working with hardware partners to create digital cam eras with built-in modems which link directly to the web. </p> <p>But the revenues generated by the e-photo firms tell only part of the story. One of their strengths is their sites' 'stickiness' - meaning they draw in visitors on a regular basis. This helps to build communities of internet users united around common interests, which in turn attract more visitors as the word spreads. And, where there are communities, there is the chance to sell them things, creating other earnings streams from e-commerce and advertising. </p> <p>'It's the Hotmail model - uniting users around a common interest. It allows for viral marketing,' Crockett said. </p> <p>According to technology market research firm PC Data Online, in April the top five e-photo websites in the US attracted nearly 7.5 million users - 10 per cent of the country's internet population. Infotrends says the figure for the whole year will total nearly 100 million. </p> <p>For this reason the big portal sites have started offering their own online photo ser vices. America Online has its You've Got Pictures service in the US (although not in Europe at the moment), while Yahoo! has struck an alliance with Shutterfly. </p> <p>One online community site, PhotoPoint.com, even went as far as to offer a fortune to the winner of its 'Million-Dollar Moment' competition, a move which generated huge publicity for the company in the US. </p> <p>More public relations stunts are inevitable in the coming months as the e-photo companies - of which there are now scores - attempt to grab more market share. </p> <p>Many of them are unlikely to survive. Lydia Loizides, an analyst with Jupiter Communications, was quoted in Upside Magazine, a technology publication, as saying that the sector is: 'fickle, promotion-intensive and can't make money'. </p> <p>Crockett agrees that there will be some sort of a shake out. 'In the US there are a considerable number of players. It makes sense for there to be only a few [e-photo firms] in the long term,' he says. </p> <p>Given the signs of an impending cull, some of the e-photo firms may not remain so snap-happy for long.</p>",

The e-photo company then scans the photos and emails you a web address where you can look at the snaps. You choose the ones you want printed and email them to friends so that they can order their own copies. The company then posts the prints and the negatives. Most firms in this field scan the films free, and charge only for the prints you order. There are various degrees of privacy, so users can if they wish bar other people from looking at their photographs. And, because all the online technology allows for interactivity, you can do lots of clever things, such as compile albums of your snaps, choose different borders and captions and, in some cases, touch up the photos to get rid of, say, that annoying red eye. Customers can also have their snaps printed on to everything from T-shirts to mouse pads to mugs. 'This will be the biggest event in the photographic print industry since the launch of 35mm film,' said Ernie Gilburd of easyMemories.com, an e-photo firm soon to be launched in the UK. Well Gilburd, who until recently headed Minit UK, the firm which owns SupaSnaps, would say that wouldn't he? However, he does join a long list of very big names who are betting on the same hunch. In the US, Jim Clark, founder of Netscape, has backed Shutterfly.com, which is owned by internet investment giant CMGi; the sector's second-largest firm, ememories.com, is supported by the likes of Goldman Sachs, Disney and George Soros. Jim Barksdale, Netscape's former chief executive, is an investor in ofoto.com, the third-largest e-photo business. Now the giant of film processors is interested. Last week Kodak, which in 1999 had sales of more than $14 billion and can't afford to see its market dominance threatened, took a stake in ememories to complement its earlier investment in snapfish.com. In the UK Boots, which processes twice as many films as its nearest rival, will launch its own e -photo service, bootsphoto.com, within the next two weeks. Photo-Me International, the company behind the booths at train stations is also launching a service. Evangelists for the new industry point to synergies between the internet and photography. 'This sort of service uses a real internet business model,' said Cameron Crockett, a founder of ideaShed, the internet incubator behind easyMemories. 'It's visual and it's light. It's easy for people to see and the service is available to everyone.' easyMemories claims its processing prices will be cheaper than in the high street. Crockett believes the business is adaptable to digitising and distributing both audio and video footage. So how big is the e-photo industry going to be? Wildly conflicting estimates show just how immature this industry is. According to analysts at Infotrends Technology Group, sales of prints developed by online firms will be worth more than $2.5 billion in 2005, compared with $20 million last year. Lyra, the photography research firm, suggests that in Asia and the Pacific Rim e-photo services will be worth nearly $650m in 2002. Crockett argues that the internet will expand the photography market. 'When APS technology [the new sort of film which makes it easier to index your prints] came out, the number of reprints as a percentage of sales went up. With these new e-photo services, in just three clicks everybody's got the index to your photos.' Similarly, he believes that the rise in the number of digital cameras will not threaten the e-photo firms: they will still make their money from printing the snaps, even if they no longer have to process them. In fact companies such as Zing.com, the market leader, are working with hardware partners to create digital cam eras with built-in modems which link directly to the web. But the revenues generated by the e-photo firms tell only part of the story. One of their strengths is their sites' 'stickiness' - meaning they draw in visitors on a regular basis. This helps to build communities of internet users united around common interests, which in turn attract more visitors as the word spreads. And, where there are communities, there is the chance to sell them things, creating other earnings streams from e-commerce and advertising. 'It's the Hotmail model - uniting users around a common interest. It allows for viral marketing,' Crockett said. According to technology market research firm PC Data Online, in April the top five e-photo websites in the US attracted nearly 7.5 million users - 10 per cent of the country's internet population. Infotrends says the figure for the whole year will total nearly 100 million. For this reason the big portal sites have started offering their own online photo ser vices. America Online has its You've Got Pictures service in the US (although not in Europe at the moment), while Yahoo! has struck an alliance with Shutterfly. One online community site, PhotoPoint.com, even went as far as to offer a fortune to the winner of its 'Million-Dollar Moment' competition, a move which generated huge publicity for the company in the US. More public relations stunts are inevitable in the coming months as the e-photo companies - of which there are now scores - attempt to grab more market share. Many of them are unlikely to survive. Lydia Loizides, an analyst with Jupiter Communications, was quoted in Upside Magazine, a technology publication, as saying that the sector is: 'fickle, promotion-intensive and can't make money'. Crockett agrees that there will be some sort of a shake out. 'In the US there are a considerable number of players. It makes sense for there to be only a few [e-photo firms] in the long term,' he says. Given the signs of an impending cull, some of the e-photo firms may not remain so snap-happy for long.",

He has very considerable international business experience. He has formed his own opinions. `He and I share the same philosophy. We come from the Ayrshire labour movement; that's where our roots are. Alex is the son of a miner, I'm the son of a railwayman.' Sillars makes `no bones' about using his column in the Scottish Sun to influence opinion.</p> <p>When Salmond announced he was stepping down from the leadership after 10 years, Sillars used the column to dismiss him as `manipulative to the end'. He said: `I don't share the general mythology of Alex's leadership. I don't share it at all. I've seen it from inside and outside.' There was a whole range of policies `enunciated' by Salmond which in fact never occurred, he said. Salmond had softened the party's attitude to devolution and could have extracted much more from Labour. Sillars himself abstained in the devolution referendum because the Parliament, he judged, had insufficient powers. His criticism of Salmond's policies extends to his style \u00d0 or the lack of it. He had been disturbed by leaks in the press that Salmond and his followers wanted to `crush' the Sillarsites and `silence them forever'. `This makes the blood run cold in a democratic society,' he said. `There's an authoritarian streak that's part of the legacy of Alex Salmond's leadership.' He thought Salmond would continue to exercise influence, but added: `He's history, like me.' Sillars believes that Westminster, with its long experience of dealing with quasi-colonial situations, had sucked the SNP into the devolution settlement. Instead of being critical of the Scottish Parliament, the SNP had been seduced into happily sitting on committees and drafting speeches. If at some point in the future the SNP grew restive, Westminster would concede a little more, while retaining control of the real levers of power. If Sillars were running SNP policy he would run that `incremental' technique in reverse. He would keep trying to win a little more power. `I have never believed the orthodox view that Scotland's public finances are in structural deficit. Gordon Brown himself has said that the oil revenues have been wasted'. In his view, the next general election had to be fought with the purpose of expanding the core nationalist vote and, as a fallback, on the platform of increasing the powers of the Scottish Parliament. Sillars, who regards England as a `friendly foreign country' where he happens to earn his living, said one of the most urgent problems facing Scotland was its alienated underclass, treated not as victims but as culprits. They were, he said, part of what Thatcherism produced. `I think that Scottish society has a better chance of dealing with them because there's an egalitarianism and still a very significant social conscience.' According to Sillars, they had found a champion in Tommy Sheridan, MSP. Sillars believed his Scottish Socialist Party posed a threat both to Labour and the SNP. He said: `I'm very fond of Tommy as an individual. I went through the poll tax with him. People shouldn't underestimate the genuine anger that fuels Tommy Sheridan and the people who are joining his party.' But the problem for Tommy `and for me', said Sillars, was that Sheridan was part of a broad socialist movement which was at a low `theoretical and intellectual ebb'. Is he a threat to the SNP? `Of course he is. We haven't given him enough reasons to join.' Sillars has often despaired of the political mission he has embraced. Once he said it was like pushing water uphill. At another time, he said the Scots were `90-minute patriots', meaning their nationalism lasted about as long as the football games into which they used to vent so many of their feelings. Does he still believe it? Sillars looks a little sad. `Yes,' he said, `except that now that rugby's the game, I suppose you can make that 80 minutes.'</p>",

Pretty awesome: in the past 12 months Channel 4 has done its bit to stop just one viewer from a) marrying David Beckham (Victoria's Secrets), b) spending the day as a vapid spokesmodel (Being Caprice) and c) becoming a child star and starving to death (Lena Zavaroni documentary). Now it has another new crusade: C4 has commissioned a programme in which six people swap genders for 'at least three weeks', to find out what it's like to be on the other side of the gender divide. Apparently after the gender-swap team have undergone 'deportment' lessons and pyschological counselling, they will be expected to return to their jobs or 'try to find new ones'! The programme will no doubt be called 'Big Brother/ Sister, Whatever', and one hopes the Good Samaritan will be finding work in the C4 building for any of the unemployable gender benders.",

Two years ago, so many of Halifax's customers were defecting that a 15 per cent share of new mortgages turned into a 3 per cent fall in loans when redemptions were included. Now, its share of new loans is a little higher but its success in reducing remortgaging means it took 12 per cent of net lending in the first half of 2000. </p> <p>Its formula is simple: it asks its customers if they would like a better deal. So far, it has asked 500,000 of them and 10 per cent have taken up the offer. The upside is Halifax keeps the customer - and has opportunities to sell more products while the new deal is being arranged. The downside is it makes less profit from the mortgage. </p> <p>In the first half, there was virtually no impact on margins but chief executive James Crosby warns they will shrink by about 5 per cent in the full year, and 10 per cent next. He is confident margins will not fall further. Others are less confident. Last week's figures from Egg suggest it is finding growth a little harder to come by than expected but, even so, the internet will inevitably decrease margins and increase customer mobility. </p> <p>The winners will be the companies that anticipate that and acting accordingly. Halifax's internet bank launch may have been delayed but its plans sound a bit more structured than those of some rivals. Crosby sounds more confident than he has for years. The shares discount too much bad news and should be bought. </p> <p><strong> ICI transformed</strong><br> ICI is a changed company, says chief executive Brendan O'Neill. The problem is, the City has failed to appreciate its transformation. If it had, it would no longer be concerned about its \u00a32.9 billion of net debt - \u00a31bn more than the assets on its balance sheet. </p> <p>It would be happy its interest bill now takes up only about a quarter of its profits and that proportion has been falling steadily for more than a year. </p> <p>The City would also appreciate that, while profits from old ICI could fluctuate by billions from the top to the bottom of the cycle, at new ICI the difference between a good and a bad year will be far less pronounced. But he failed to give any hints as to whether investors should also now accept that the group's dividend policy be consigned to its imperial past. The interim payout was maintained at 12.5p but that represents 40 per cent of the total for the year. It will not give a hint on future payments until it announces full year results next February. </p> <p>O'Neill should bite the bullet and cut it to a more realistic level. Earnings have been more than twice the level of dividends in only one of the last seven years and, on current forecasts, it will be at least 2003 before they reach that level again. Cutting it now would not only allow the group to start growing its payout again, it would also free resources to invest elsewhere in the business. </p> <p>O'Neill's problem has been that the City could have interpreted a cut in previous years as a distress signal, a sign that he was not confident the transformation from indus trial chemicals monolith to a customer-focused business that happens to use some bulk chemicals as its raw material would be a success. </p> <p>That should no longer be an issue. Last week's interim results show sales are moving decisively upwards; in all its core divisions margins are improving and there is a new confidence about the group. There are still a few hangovers in the form of old-ICI businesses still to be sold. But these are increasingly irrelevant. O'Neill has proved he can transform the group. He should now transform its dividends. </p> <p><strong> The right fit</strong><br> BAAN, the Dutch software group, must be pretty special. Invensys, the industrial controls group buying it, has put up with a revolt from one group of shareholders, complaints about tax from another, rumblings from the unions - and is obliged to pay out \u20ac100m to avoid collapse. But will the deal be worth the heartache? </p> <p>Allen Yurko, Invensys' chief executive, is confident it will be. The fit between the two groups is perfect. Invensys supplies much of the standard automation equipment on most factory floors. Baan provides the software that helps companies tailor products to customer ordering. Put them together and you can offer state-of-the-art manufacturing systems to blue-chip customers as diverse as Boeing and AT&amp;T. </p> <p>The theory is sound but will it work? Baan's poor condition when Invensys made its offer makes it even harder to judge than usual. Invensys is no doubt right that Baan's problems are not because of its products but its financial management. It expanded too far, too fast and failed to cut costs when orders dipped last year. But Baan has been financially unstable for more than two years and the longer that continues, the more likely operations will be affected. There are signs of that happening: Baan's share of the business software market is down from 10 per cent to 4 per cent in two years. </p> <p>Yurko has talked to its top 10 customers, believes they have been deferring orders and is confident they will come back once financial stability has been achieved. He may be right. But there is also a risk they will be tempted away to rivals such as Oracle - which will not have been slow to take advantage of Baan's problems. And how motivated will Baan's workforce have been to keep developing innovative products? </p> <p>At least Invensys is not betting the company. The cost, including debt taken on, is less than \u00a3550m. It will spend a further \u00a3260m on restructuring, but believes that will produce savings of \u00a3160m a year by 2002. It is promising at least 10 per cent return on sales by the same date, with further increases thereafter. </p> <p>If that is achieved, the deal will look a reasonable one - and any synergy benefits from getting new customers for its existing business will be icing on the cake. The problems could turn out to be worse than expected and the \u20ac100m cash injection last week may mark the start, not the end, of the rescue package. Yurko says he has done more due diligence on this than any other deal in a decade with the group. His record is good enough for shareholders to trust his instincts.</p>",

Since this information comes from the impeccably researched news pages of the Daily Star, its veracity cannot be in doubt. The honourable tradition of half-naked Norwegian weather girls and the much-lamented News Bunny - bequeathed to us by Kelvin Mackenzie when he ran the cable channel L!ve TV - is now burrowing its way into the newly liberated culture of Eastern Europe. For this, the Berlin Wall came down. </p> <p>If the Russians think they have a ratings problem, spare a thought for our own 24-hour news channels. While Sky News, BBC News 24 and CNN barely register on the BARB Richter scale (respectively 0.4 per cent, 0.1 per cent and 0.1 per cent of audience share according to ITC figures), they will be joined on Tuesday by a fourth 24-hour news service from ITN. ITN's boast is that, while its rivals have book reviews, chat shows and other time-filling distractions, its own service will be news, all the news and nothing but news (I paraphrase, but that's the gist). </p> <p>Given that the marketplace in news channels is not so much crowded as seriously uncomfortable for sardines, two questions about the ITN enterprise come to mind. First, why do it? CNN was first into the field, made lots of mistakes, but established itself as world leader. Sky pioneered the British version as Murdoch's placatory loss-leader to Margaret Thatcher, but Sky News is generally regarded as doing a fair job. </p> <p>The BBC simply could not afford to let it go: you can't expect to remain the most authoritative source of news in a multi-channel world if you don't have a 24-hour news presence (even if two-thirds of homes aren't interested in the TV revolution). For the BBC not to have a 24-hour news channel would be like not having Radio 4. </p> <p>But ITN? It might share the BBC's reputation for trust and impartiality but, as with FA Cup Finals and Royal Weddings, it will always come a poor ratings second when going head to head with the nation's public broadcaster. Ultimately I suspect that ITN is there simply because its rivals are, and is seriously worried about being able to sustain its heavyweight reputation without a 24-hour presence. </p> <p>This gives a clue about resolving a second question: how are these channels going to make their mark, given that audience size and profitability are unlikely to be the main criteria for success? How will they stand out from the crowd? </p> <p>For CNN in the UK this is a largely redundant question, although its history offers some interesting pointers to establishing a reputation: this was less to do with dogged journalism and more with a combination of sheer cunning and opportunism. </p> <p>According to last week's Broadcast magazine, CNN's famous 'scoop' of the Challenger space shuttle breaking up was actually NASA material distributed by CNN. And its equally famous 'exclusive' of the first live coverage of the Gulf War was actually audio with still pictures. </p> <p>Its reputation of being 'first with the news' relies heavily on international contacts and international partners. </p> <p>For the BBC, there is simply the brand. Any time a big story breaks, the BBC is still the first port of call, and this model of audience behaviour will apply as much to 24-hour news channels as to terrestrial bulletins. </p> <p>Sky News has established something of a following since it was the first British operation into the field, and its brand has not yet been 'contaminated' (pace Philip Gould) by its connection with the Murdoch empire. What \u00eds left for ITN? </p> <p>The answer might be some real investment in good old-fashioned investigative journalism. It would be expensive, it would need commitment and promotion as well as a pool of dedicated journalists with time to dig around for stories. But a 24-hour channel that breaks stories would be a genuine contribution to diversity. </p> <p>There was a good example of this on Radio 4's PM programme 10 days ago. It led its bulletin on an exclusive story about the UK's role as the centre of a trafficking scheme which involved Nigerian women being sold for sex. On the day that every other bulletin was leading on Prescott's transport spending plans and the discovery of a shoe in the Sarah Payne murder case, PM came up with its own exclusive and gave it plenty of air time. </p> <p>If ITN's service is given the resources to break new ground with original and first-rate journalism (just as it did in 1955 when it challenged the BBC news monopoly) it could enhance its own reputation as well as making a real contribution to an informed democracy. Alternatively, it could go down the Russian route and ask Sir Trevor to get his kit off. </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:S.Barnett@wmin.ac.uk\">S.Barnett@wmin.ac.uk</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Dumbing down the news, part two. Apparently, a Russian TV station has taken to hiring nude presenters for its news bulletins in order to halt a ratings slide. Since this information comes from the impeccably researched news pages of the Daily Star, its veracity cannot be in doubt. The honourable tradition of half-naked Norwegian weather girls and the much-lamented News Bunny - bequeathed to us by Kelvin Mackenzie when he ran the cable channel L!ve TV - is now burrowing its way into the newly liberated culture of Eastern Europe. For this, the Berlin Wall came down. If the Russians think they have a ratings problem, spare a thought for our own 24-hour news channels. While Sky News, BBC News 24 and CNN barely register on the BARB Richter scale (respectively 0.4 per cent, 0.1 per cent and 0.1 per cent of audience share according to ITC figures), they will be joined on Tuesday by a fourth 24-hour news service from ITN. ITN's boast is that, while its rivals have book reviews, chat shows and other time-filling distractions, its own service will be news, all the news and nothing but news (I paraphrase, but that's the gist). Given that the marketplace in news channels is not so much crowded as seriously uncomfortable for sardines, two questions about the ITN enterprise come to mind. First, why do it? CNN was first into the field, made lots of mistakes, but established itself as world leader. Sky pioneered the British version as Murdoch's placatory loss-leader to Margaret Thatcher, but Sky News is generally regarded as doing a fair job. The BBC simply could not afford to let it go: you can't expect to remain the most authoritative source of news in a multi-channel world if you don't have a 24-hour news presence (even if two-thirds of homes aren't interested in the TV revolution). For the BBC not to have a 24-hour news channel would be like not having Radio 4. But ITN? It might share the BBC's reputation for trust and impartiality but, as with FA Cup Finals and Royal Weddings, it will always come a poor ratings second when going head to head with the nation's public broadcaster. Ultimately I suspect that ITN is there simply because its rivals are, and is seriously worried about being able to sustain its heavyweight reputation without a 24-hour presence. This gives a clue about resolving a second question: how are these channels going to make their mark, given that audience size and profitability are unlikely to be the main criteria for success? How will they stand out from the crowd? For CNN in the UK this is a largely redundant question, although its history offers some interesting pointers to establishing a reputation: this was less to do with dogged journalism and more with a combination of sheer cunning and opportunism. According to last week's Broadcast magazine, CNN's famous 'scoop' of the Challenger space shuttle breaking up was actually NASA material distributed by CNN. And its equally famous 'exclusive' of the first live coverage of the Gulf War was actually audio with still pictures. Its reputation of being 'first with the news' relies heavily on international contacts and international partners. For the BBC, there is simply the brand. Any time a big story breaks, the BBC is still the first port of call, and this model of audience behaviour will apply as much to 24-hour news channels as to terrestrial bulletins. Sky News has established something of a following since it was the first British operation into the field, and its brand has not yet been 'contaminated' (pace Philip Gould) by its connection with the Murdoch empire. What \u00eds left for ITN? The answer might be some real investment in good old-fashioned investigative journalism. It would be expensive, it would need commitment and promotion as well as a pool of dedicated journalists with time to dig around for stories. But a 24-hour channel that breaks stories would be a genuine contribution to diversity. There was a good example of this on Radio 4's PM programme 10 days ago. It led its bulletin on an exclusive story about the UK's role as the centre of a trafficking scheme which involved Nigerian women being sold for sex. On the day that every other bulletin was leading on Prescott's transport spending plans and the discovery of a shoe in the Sarah Payne murder case, PM came up with its own exclusive and gave it plenty of air time. If ITN's service is given the resources to break new ground with original and first-rate journalism (just as it did in 1955 when it challenged the BBC news monopoly) it could enhance its own reputation as well as making a real contribution to an informed democracy. Alternatively, it could go down the Russian route and ask Sir Trevor to get his kit off. S.Barnett@wmin.ac.uk",

'I just cannot imagine.

Surely he is not taking one of his own package holidays? </p> <p>'Of course!' he said, full of mock indignation. </p> <p>That'll be two weeks in Benidorm then, beating the Brits to the sunbeds at dawn? </p> <p>Not quite. Frenzel, his wife Gabi and their three children are off to Crete to one of Preussag's Robinson Clubs - a very upmarket sort of resort/holiday camp with the best beaches, diving and golfing Greece can offer. </p> <p>Exclusive, but a package holiday none the less. And he is flying squashed in with the plebs on one of the ordinary charter jets operated by his company's airline Hapag Lloyd. </p> <p>He intends to spend the next few weeks splashing around, strolling on the golf links and 'relaxing with a glass of wine' to celebrate his coup. </p> <p>Back in May, Preussag was the heavyweight that pounced at the eleventh hour and snatched Thomson from the clutches of Germany's second largest travel company, C&amp;N Touristic. </p> <p>Observers had not fully expected the move because Preussag already owned the best-known travel brand in the world - Britain's Thomas Cook - and had promised to turn it into the UK's market leader ahead of Thomson and Airtours in a few years' time. </p> <p>But when it came to the crunch, Thomson was irresistible. Frenzel and two of his closest associates held a boardroom huddle and made the decision to ditch Thomas Cook for Thomson. </p> <p>Preussag went on a share-buying frenzy, persuaded the original Canadian Thomson family shareholders to sell up and trumped C&amp;N to the purchase. </p> <p>The newly combined Preussag-Thomson will become the biggest package holiday company in the world, overtaking Britain's Airtours, which was built from scratch by home-grown Lancashire entrepreneur David Crossland. </p> <p>There has been much gloating in the German press, invoking the sort of 'landing on the beaches' clich\u00e9s that some Brits and Germans never seem to tire of. </p> <p>Frenzel said: 'There is no reason for [the British] to feel defeated. Quite the opposite. What we are creating with Thomson is the biggest [holiday] company in the world, with huge potential. The customers will immediately feel a positive effect.' </p> <p>Frenzel, born in Leipzig, has come a long way since he boarded a train in East Germany in 1956 and ended up in the Federal Republic. </p> <p>He recalls: 'My mother had already travelled west with my two sisters when the border was still open for visiting. </p> <p>'I went with my father in a battered old Opel. We abandoned the car in Potsdam, took the subway to Berlin and went through to the west side by train. We went as visitors but then stayed. It was not legal but, because the wall had not gone up, it was possible.' </p> <p>They flew to Hanover 'and that was the beginning of my career in the west'. </p> <p>The nine-year-old Michael thought the whole thing a huge adventure. He mostly remembers his first encounter with the image of Mickey Mouse and being taken to a proper cinema to watch the film of Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea . </p> <p>The Frenzels settled down in the west and Michael studied law at Ruhr University in Bochum, near Dortmund. He became a scientific assistant at the university, where he completed his doctorate. </p> <p>But he never became a lawyer or a scientist - perhaps realising that power and wealth were best pursued in the world of business and finance. </p> <p>He joined Westdeutsche Landesbank (WestLB) in D\u00fcsseldorf in 1981 and got a taste for industry when he managed the industrial equities department two years later. </p> <p>WestLB is a 33 per cent shareholder of Preussag, and when Frenzel jumped from banking to business the company was a heavy industrial conglomerate covering everything from mining and shipbuilding to engineering - but nothing as fluffy as a package holiday. </p> <p>The transformation in the six years since Frenzel became chairman has been staggering. In a high-risk move he ditched the stodgy industrial interests and turned it entirely into a leisure giant. </p> <p>The Thomson move has set Preussag on the road to world domination in the land of sun, sea and sand, although the deal has left some Thomas Cook people very disappointed. Frenzel reportedly failed to warn his Cook's colleagues he was going to jilt them for Thomson until the deal was virtually done. </p> <p>One travel industry source said: 'There was a lot of trust between Thomas Cook and Preussag. Frenzel said he was going to build Cook's into market leader. That would have taken two or three years, of course, but he seemed very committed, and when he sprung the Thomson deal people did feel betrayed.' </p> <p>Others attest to the size of his ego in the context of the ferocious competitiveness between Preussag and C&amp;N. </p> <p>Sources now say that senior Thomas Cook executives selflessly advised Frenzel in February, when the Thomson share price was down around 70p, that if he wanted to be 'biggest and best' he should ditch Cook's and snap up Thomson. </p> <p>Frenzel reportedly shunned the idea, only to return to the fray when C&amp;N began to woo Thomson, eventually offering 160p a share. He denied this version of events last week, but did not sound convincing. </p> <p>One former Thomson executive said: 'Preussag is paying a lot for the business. It is unlikely to generate sufficient cashflow to justify that kind of expenditure. This deal was as much about stopping their major rivals from doing it as the deal itself.' </p> <p>The ex-executive did concede, however, that Frenzel's handling of the transformation of Preussag and its holiday brand Tui had been impressive and Frenzel was 'chic and charismatic'. </p> <p>He is certainly in a much more glamourous business with holidays than a state-owned bank or steelmaker, and that seems to suit him. </p> <p>Frenzel has often been seen as the heir apparent to the chairman of WestLB, Fiedel Neuber, who retires in the next year or two. Neuber groomed the budding Frenzel as his prot\u00e9g\u00e9. </p> <p>But Frenzel dismissed this idea last week. 'That is a very old rumour and the truth is completely the opposite. It is the biggest challenge for me to build up the leading travel company in the world. My place is here in Hanover.' </p> <p><strong>Profile </strong></p> <p><strong> Name:</strong> Michael Frenzel </p> <p><strong> Title:</strong> Chairman of Preussag </p> <p><strong> Date of birth:</strong> 2 March 1947 </p> <p><strong> Other directorships:</strong> Axa insurance group; Deutsche Bahn Railways </p> <p><strong> Hobbies:</strong> Golf, diving, sailing</p>",

Frenzel, his wife Gabi and their three children are off to Crete to one of Preussag's Robinson Clubs - a very upmarket sort of resort/holiday camp with the best beaches, diving and golfing Greece can offer. Exclusive, but a package holiday none the less. And he is flying squashed in with the plebs on one of the ordinary charter jets operated by his company's airline Hapag Lloyd. He intends to spend the next few weeks splashing around, strolling on the golf links and 'relaxing with a glass of wine' to celebrate his coup. Back in May, Preussag was the heavyweight that pounced at the eleventh hour and snatched Thomson from the clutches of Germany's second largest travel company, C&amp;N Touristic. Observers had not fully expected the move because Preussag already owned the best-known travel brand in the world - Britain's Thomas Cook - and had promised to turn it into the UK's market leader ahead of Thomson and Airtours in a few years' time. But when it came to the crunch, Thomson was irresistible. Frenzel and two of his closest associates held a boardroom huddle and made the decision to ditch Thomas Cook for Thomson. Preussag went on a share-buying frenzy, persuaded the original Canadian Thomson family shareholders to sell up and trumped C&amp;N to the purchase. The newly combined Preussag-Thomson will become the biggest package holiday company in the world, overtaking Britain's Airtours, which was built from scratch by home-grown Lancashire entrepreneur David Crossland. There has been much gloating in the German press, invoking the sort of 'landing on the beaches' clich\u00e9s that some Brits and Germans never seem to tire of. Frenzel said: 'There is no reason for [the British] to feel defeated. Quite the opposite. What we are creating with Thomson is the biggest [holiday] company in the world, with huge potential. The customers will immediately feel a positive effect.' Frenzel, born in Leipzig, has come a long way since he boarded a train in East Germany in 1956 and ended up in the Federal Republic. He recalls: 'My mother had already travelled west with my two sisters when the border was still open for visiting. 'I went with my father in a battered old Opel. We abandoned the car in Potsdam, took the subway to Berlin and went through to the west side by train. We went as visitors but then stayed. It was not legal but, because the wall had not gone up, it was possible.' They flew to Hanover 'and that was the beginning of my career in the west'. The nine-year-old Michael thought the whole thing a huge adventure. He mostly remembers his first encounter with the image of Mickey Mouse and being taken to a proper cinema to watch the film of Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea . The Frenzels settled down in the west and Michael studied law at Ruhr University in Bochum, near Dortmund. He became a scientific assistant at the university, where he completed his doctorate. But he never became a lawyer or a scientist - perhaps realising that power and wealth were best pursued in the world of business and finance. He joined Westdeutsche Landesbank (WestLB) in D\u00fcsseldorf in 1981 and got a taste for industry when he managed the industrial equities department two years later. WestLB is a 33 per cent shareholder of Preussag, and when Frenzel jumped from banking to business the company was a heavy industrial conglomerate covering everything from mining and shipbuilding to engineering - but nothing as fluffy as a package holiday. The transformation in the six years since Frenzel became chairman has been staggering. In a high-risk move he ditched the stodgy industrial interests and turned it entirely into a leisure giant. The Thomson move has set Preussag on the road to world domination in the land of sun, sea and sand, although the deal has left some Thomas Cook people very disappointed. Frenzel reportedly failed to warn his Cook's colleagues he was going to jilt them for Thomson until the deal was virtually done. One travel industry source said: 'There was a lot of trust between Thomas Cook and Preussag. Frenzel said he was going to build Cook's into market leader. That would have taken two or three years, of course, but he seemed very committed, and when he sprung the Thomson deal people did feel betrayed.' Others attest to the size of his ego in the context of the ferocious competitiveness between Preussag and C&amp;N. Sources now say that senior Thomas Cook executives selflessly advised Frenzel in February, when the Thomson share price was down around 70p, that if he wanted to be 'biggest and best' he should ditch Cook's and snap up Thomson. Frenzel reportedly shunned the idea, only to return to the fray when C&amp;N began to woo Thomson, eventually offering 160p a share. He denied this version of events last week, but did not sound convincing. One former Thomson executive said: 'Preussag is paying a lot for the business. It is unlikely to generate sufficient cashflow to justify that kind of expenditure. This deal was as much about stopping their major rivals from doing it as the deal itself.' The ex-executive did concede, however, that Frenzel's handling of the transformation of Preussag and its holiday brand Tui had been impressive and Frenzel was 'chic and charismatic'. He is certainly in a much more glamourous business with holidays than a state-owned bank or steelmaker, and that seems to suit him. Frenzel has often been seen as the heir apparent to the chairman of WestLB, Fiedel Neuber, who retires in the next year or two. Neuber groomed the budding Frenzel as his prot\u00e9g\u00e9. But Frenzel dismissed this idea last week. 'That is a very old rumour and the truth is completely the opposite. It is the biggest challenge for me to build up the leading travel company in the world. My place is here in Hanover.'

It will issue a 'stealth warning' that 'yet more tax hikes' are likely as a means of countering the inflationary impact of increased public sector spending. The Item Club's forecast uses language that is overtly political compared with the sober tone of many economic analyses. It refers to 'Gordon's cunning public relations plan' and speaks of the British economy looking 'increasingly backward' in the face of Germany's newly won tax-cutting credentials. The report predicts problems from attempting to pour money into services starved of funds for some time. 'Previous stop-go episodes have shown that you cannot get value for money if you run your procurement policy like a concertina,' it says.

      "body": "<p>Being the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry can seem rather like being the Prince of Wales. It is often seen as a job en route to greater things. The challenge is to be useful while not creating a mess or being damaged by events. </p> <p>But the current incumbent has had an annus horribilis. Faced with Rover and Ford crashes, a steel meltdown, unravelling textiles, sinking shipbuilding, manufacturing pounded by sterling, coal in the pits, Stephen Byers has been hopping from one crisis summit to another. </p> <p>Armed with sums paltry by other departmental standards (the flagship DTI regional selective assistance budget for industry is \u00a3120 million) he has tried to stem disgruntlement in Labour's industrial heartlands while avoiding the charge of returning to picking winners and supporting lame ducks. </p> <p>This week, however, Byers wants to relaunch the DTI as an organisation with a mission rather than one battered by events. Sceptics will return to Nicholas Ridley's famous remark: 'What is this place for?' </p> <p>Lord Young, a previous Trade Secretary, made his views on red tape clear last week. And Labour's opponents will point to coal, cars and ships and observe wryly that too many lame ducks are still waddling around. </p> <p>Even less hostile experts say the DTI has a rather limited set of key competencies beyond which its role becomes problematic. </p> <p>Digby Jones, director-general of the CBI, says: 'The biggest task of the DTI is to be a champion of business across government and to ensure that the impact of regulations is at the front of people's minds when they draw them up.' </p> <p>Peter Robinson of the Institute for Public Policy Research says: 'The DTI has several core competencies - ensuring effective competition and regulation, preventing market failure in product markets, striking the right balance in Labour markets, and spending on science.' </p> <p>In all these core areas, Labour has acted - bringing in the Competition Act to stamp on anti-competitive practices, rebalancing power in labour markets through the minimum wage and working time regulations, and boosting the science budget. </p> <p>But according to officials, Byers wants to argue that there is more to the DTI than overseeing competition and regulation policy and cutting red tape - a natural instinct for a politician with a public profile to think about. </p> <p>The DTI can have an active industrial policy without going back to the Sixties and Seventies by stimulating the 'new', knowledge-based economy while trying to help old industries take greater advantage of its fruits. </p> <p>It will be a difficult trick to pull off: there is deep suspicion of bureaucratic intervention in markets and in business. </p> <p>Jones says: 'It is not the role of the DTI to pick winners and losers. We need a strengthening of productivity, so that our traded goods and services become more competitive. </p> <p>'Those industries that have been in decline for many years, if they are not at the value-added end of production, will face problems. The inevitable will happen - commoditised production will go off to other economies with cheaper labour, and they will not compete.' </p> <p>But he concedes that there is a role. 'The DTI must focus on assisting industries which are interfacing with the value end of the economy.' </p> <p>The challenge is huge, and slippery. First, assessing where Britain's strengths and weaknesses lie is difficult. Second, it seems there are too many weaknesses. Third, and perhaps most difficult of all, is working out whether and how to help. </p> <p>Measuring Britain's competitive position has been a key priority for the DTI since Margaret Beckett took over in May 1997. In its November 1997 document, 'A Benchmark for Business', the DTI found the UK struggling. It pointed to GDP per head below OECD average, a productivity gap with the US of 20 per cent and with France and Germany of 25 to 30 per cent, and investment gaps at similar levels. </p> <p>Focusing on the 'knowledge economy' paints a no less challenging picture. Despite talk of Britain leading the way in areas such as biotechnology and aerospace, OECD statistics comparing Britain with its competitors present a different picture. </p> <p>On one level, Britain has been doing well. It is sixth in the OECD league table in spending on information and communications technology (ICT), channelling 8 per cent of GDP into IT hardware, software/services and telecoms. </p> <p>The UK has among the highest inward investment in research facilities from global players such as Microsoft, and the third-highest number of graduates entering science and engineering as a proportion of the labour force. </p> <p>However, the OECD figures show some more worrying trends. The UK's research and development spending as a proportion of GDP has fallen dramatically - from 2.4 per cent in the early Eighties to 1.9 per cent in 1997. \u00cet is now below the EU average - although, as in the US, this is partly caused by a fall in defence spending. Business's spending on R&amp;D and innovation is not good - it stands below the OECD average in total, and has been shrinking since 1990. </p> <p>The effect on UK trade is intriguing. One OECD indicator attempts to calculate the technology trade balance, and finds the UK in deficit by about 0.1 per cent of GDP, while countries such as Switzerland, Sweden, the US, Japan and Holland have positive balances. </p> <p>OECD research economist Michael Freudenberg says: 'One thing you could say - hesitantly - is that the UK exports fewer high-quality, high-technology goods than it imports.' </p> <p>Another table shows that the UK is below both OECD and EU average in terms of the price and quality of goods that it exports. </p> <p>The report states: 'High quality _ depends on R&amp;D expenditure, labour qualification, specific organisation of the procedures of firms.' The implication is that the UK is reaping a thin harvest from past underinvestment. </p> <p>Clearly the DTI's task of forging a strong position in the new economy is huge. </p> <p>The OECD itself has specific suggestions. It says vigorous competition is needed to keep ICT costs down, to encourage new entrants and greater productivity. It advocates flexible labour markets, funding of science, more effective conversion of research into commercial ideas, and policy support for R&amp;D and venture capital. </p> <p>It also suggests investment in 'human capital' - encouraging immigration of highly skilled people to counter brain-drain effects. It also recommends the use of share options in start-up companies to promote entrpreneurialism. </p> <p>Paul Geroski of the London Business School says: 'You have to be careful not to create white elephants such as the Sinclair C5, but the DTI can be useful in forging relationships between science and industry. </p> <p>'It can do this by strengthening venturing and venture capital. And it should not forget that one of the biggest buyers of knowledge-based products is the Government. It's no mistake that advances in IT grow up around procurement by government agencies such as the US Department of Defence.' </p> <p>Some of the OECD suggestions may have a familiar ring to them. The Government has announced a sharp increase in the science budget, from \u00a31.6bn this year to \u00a32.2bn in 2003/4, and last week's science White Paper acknowledged the challenge of getting ideas from universities to companies. </p> <p>Labour has set up tax incentives for corporate venturing and regional venture capital funds. It has also widened availability of share options to small company employees, encouraged investment by altering capital gains tax regulations, and promoted R&amp;D tax credits. And last week, there were suggestions of a relaxation of immigration policies for the highly skilled. </p> <p>The Government has pursued increased competition in ICT, perhaps not as quickly as elsewhere, but pressure to open up BT monopoly 'local loop' services has grown. Since free internet service providers (ISPs) such as Freeserve have emerged, Oftel, the telecommunications watchdog, claims the UK has among the world's lowest internet connection costs. </p> <p>But this leads to another problem for the DTI: much of its advice has already found its way into policy. Unless there is some truly radical thinking, Byers is unlikely to be able to relaunch his DTI around revolutionary new policies. </p> <p>A downside for Byers is that much of the thunder in all of this has been stolen by Gordon Brown. But then many of the reforms involved have been of the tax system. </p> <p>But Brown has been roaming in DTI territory - earlier this year, for example he demanded that BT open its local loop more quickly than planned. </p> <p>The final problem is that all of these good works have been eclipsed by the crisis in Labour-voting 'old economy' sectors. Byers needs to promote British success in the future economy while not abandoning the politically vital manufacturing past. </p> <p>TUC chief economist David Coates meets the prospect of talk on the 'new economy' with a groan. He points back to productivity and investment gaps and says it is as important to find ways to close these in traditional sectors to ensure their future as it is to concentrate on new-economy companies. </p> <p>The DTI has, he believes, a role in 'helping industry through difficulties, enabling employers and unions to respond by increasing productivity and raising skills levels'. </p> <p>The CBI's Jones does not seem to disagree with that.

      "bodyText": "Being the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry can seem rather like being the Prince of Wales. It is often seen as a job en route to greater things. The challenge is to be useful while not creating a mess or being damaged by events. But the current incumbent has had an annus horribilis. Faced with Rover and Ford crashes, a steel meltdown, unravelling textiles, sinking shipbuilding, manufacturing pounded by sterling, coal in the pits, Stephen Byers has been hopping from one crisis summit to another. Armed with sums paltry by other departmental standards (the flagship DTI regional selective assistance budget for industry is \u00a3120 million) he has tried to stem disgruntlement in Labour's industrial heartlands while avoiding the charge of returning to picking winners and supporting lame ducks. This week, however, Byers wants to relaunch the DTI as an organisation with a mission rather than one battered by events. Sceptics will return to Nicholas Ridley's famous remark: 'What is this place for?' Lord Young, a previous Trade Secretary, made his views on red tape clear last week. And Labour's opponents will point to coal, cars and ships and observe wryly that too many lame ducks are still waddling around. Even less hostile experts say the DTI has a rather limited set of key competencies beyond which its role becomes problematic. Digby Jones, director-general of the CBI, says: 'The biggest task of the DTI is to be a champion of business across government and to ensure that the impact of regulations is at the front of people's minds when they draw them up.' Peter Robinson of the Institute for Public Policy Research says: 'The DTI has several core competencies - ensuring effective competition and regulation, preventing market failure in product markets, striking the right balance in Labour markets, and spending on science.' In all these core areas, Labour has acted - bringing in the Competition Act to stamp on anti-competitive practices, rebalancing power in labour markets through the minimum wage and working time regulations, and boosting the science budget. But according to officials, Byers wants to argue that there is more to the DTI than overseeing competition and regulation policy and cutting red tape - a natural instinct for a politician with a public profile to think about. The DTI can have an active industrial policy without going back to the Sixties and Seventies by stimulating the 'new', knowledge-based economy while trying to help old industries take greater advantage of its fruits. It will be a difficult trick to pull off: there is deep suspicion of bureaucratic intervention in markets and in business. Jones says: 'It is not the role of the DTI to pick winners and losers. We need a strengthening of productivity, so that our traded goods and services become more competitive. 'Those industries that have been in decline for many years, if they are not at the value-added end of production, will face problems. The inevitable will happen - commoditised production will go off to other economies with cheaper labour, and they will not compete.' But he concedes that there is a role. 'The DTI must focus on assisting industries which are interfacing with the value end of the economy.' The challenge is huge, and slippery. First, assessing where Britain's strengths and weaknesses lie is difficult. Second, it seems there are too many weaknesses. Third, and perhaps most difficult of all, is working out whether and how to help. Measuring Britain's competitive position has been a key priority for the DTI since Margaret Beckett took over in May 1997. In its November 1997 document, 'A Benchmark for Business', the DTI found the UK struggling. It pointed to GDP per head below OECD average, a productivity gap with the US of 20 per cent and with France and Germany of 25 to 30 per cent, and investment gaps at similar levels. Focusing on the 'knowledge economy' paints a no less challenging picture. Despite talk of Britain leading the way in areas such as biotechnology and aerospace, OECD statistics comparing Britain with its competitors present a different picture. On one level, Britain has been doing well. It is sixth in the OECD league table in spending on information and communications technology (ICT), channelling 8 per cent of GDP into IT hardware, software/services and telecoms. The UK has among the highest inward investment in research facilities from global players such as Microsoft, and the third-highest number of graduates entering science and engineering as a proportion of the labour force. However, the OECD figures show some more worrying trends. The UK's research and development spending as a proportion of GDP has fallen dramatically - from 2.4 per cent in the early Eighties to 1.9 per cent in 1997. \u00cet is now below the EU average - although, as in the US, this is partly caused by a fall in defence spending. Business's spending on R&amp;D and innovation is not good - it stands below the OECD average in total, and has been shrinking since 1990. The effect on UK trade is intriguing. One OECD indicator attempts to calculate the technology trade balance, and finds the UK in deficit by about 0.1 per cent of GDP, while countries such as Switzerland, Sweden, the US, Japan and Holland have positive balances. OECD research economist Michael Freudenberg says: 'One thing you could say - hesitantly - is that the UK exports fewer high-quality, high-technology goods than it imports.' Another table shows that the UK is below both OECD and EU average in terms of the price and quality of goods that it exports. The report states: 'High quality _ depends on R&amp;D expenditure, labour qualification, specific organisation of the procedures of firms.' The implication is that the UK is reaping a thin harvest from past underinvestment. Clearly the DTI's task of forging a strong position in the new economy is huge. The OECD itself has specific suggestions. It says vigorous competition is needed to keep ICT costs down, to encourage new entrants and greater productivity. It advocates flexible labour markets, funding of science, more effective conversion of research into commercial ideas, and policy support for R&amp;D and venture capital. It also suggests investment in 'human capital' - encouraging immigration of highly skilled people to counter brain-drain effects. It also recommends the use of share options in start-up companies to promote entrpreneurialism. Paul Geroski of the London Business School says: 'You have to be careful not to create white elephants such as the Sinclair C5, but the DTI can be useful in forging relationships between science and industry. 'It can do this by strengthening venturing and venture capital. And it should not forget that one of the biggest buyers of knowledge-based products is the Government. It's no mistake that advances in IT grow up around procurement by government agencies such as the US Department of Defence.' Some of the OECD suggestions may have a familiar ring to them. The Government has announced a sharp increase in the science budget, from \u00a31.6bn this year to \u00a32.2bn in 2003/4, and last week's science White Paper acknowledged the challenge of getting ideas from universities to companies. Labour has set up tax incentives for corporate venturing and regional venture capital funds. It has also widened availability of share options to small company employees, encouraged investment by altering capital gains tax regulations, and promoted R&amp;D tax credits. And last week, there were suggestions of a relaxation of immigration policies for the highly skilled. The Government has pursued increased competition in ICT, perhaps not as quickly as elsewhere, but pressure to open up BT monopoly 'local loop' services has grown. Since free internet service providers (ISPs) such as Freeserve have emerged, Oftel, the telecommunications watchdog, claims the UK has among the world's lowest internet connection costs. But this leads to another problem for the DTI: much of its advice has already found its way into policy. Unless there is some truly radical thinking, Byers is unlikely to be able to relaunch his DTI around revolutionary new policies. A downside for Byers is that much of the thunder in all of this has been stolen by Gordon Brown. But then many of the reforms involved have been of the tax system. But Brown has been roaming in DTI territory - earlier this year, for example he demanded that BT open its local loop more quickly than planned. The final problem is that all of these good works have been eclipsed by the crisis in Labour-voting 'old economy' sectors. Byers needs to promote British success in the future economy while not abandoning the politically vital manufacturing past. TUC chief economist David Coates meets the prospect of talk on the 'new economy' with a groan. He points back to productivity and investment gaps and says it is as important to find ways to close these in traditional sectors to ensure their future as it is to concentrate on new-economy companies. The DTI has, he believes, a role in 'helping industry through difficulties, enabling employers and unions to respond by increasing productivity and raising skills levels'. The CBI's Jones does not seem to disagree with that. He believes the DTI should help either through direct financial assistance or by the creation of incentives or, perhaps most importantly, through training, to help companies that have a future. The acid test for intervention, he says, is whether industries, old or new, are working their way towards producing higher-quality, higher-value goods. Many of Byers's crisis 'summits' this year have had this theme. Textiles should focus on design and fashion, shipbuilding on specialist craft. The Rover rescue package was aimed at reskilling those who faced unemployment. Phoenix, the owner of Rover, is now aiming to produce 'niche' market, higher- price cars. This however, could be said to smack of picking winners for the future. The IPPR's Robinson has qualms: 'Talk of promoting the new economy sounds ominously like support for \"infant industries\" which George Brown and Harold Wilson used to talk about.' But perhaps this is being over-churlish, particularly to a politician trying to expunge memories of an annus horribilis this year in time for a general election next.",

You could argue that the economy is going so well (the fashionable view, about which I have reservations) that he does not need to concern himself with it. </p> <p>It could also be said that Blair is happy to leave the economy in Gordon Brown's hands. Brown certainly breaks all the rules of the European Union working-time directive in the number of hours he puts in on the economy - although, if it is true that he only begins work at 6am he still has to catch up with Sir Stafford Cripps, Labour Chancellor after Hugh Dalton's 'Budget leak' resignation in 1947, who began work at 5am. </p> <p>If members of this Government had to resign every time there was an embarrassing leak, there would be no Cabinet left by now. No doubt a much smaller cabinet would suit the Prime Minister well, because, as he is finding to his cost, democracy and colleagues can be tiresome when one has ambitions to break the mould of British politics. Nigel Lawson once joked that Thatcher's ideal was a Cabinet of one: herself. </p> <p>Nevertheless, the delegation of almost everything concerned with the economy to the Chancellor (with occasional intervention in things like the minimum wage) is unusual: if one looks back over the past 50 years, Macmillan, Wilson, Heath, Callaghan, Thatcher and Major all took a much greater interest in the economy than Blair seems to. Perhaps there was a greater sense of crisis then. Perhaps it doesn't matter very much. </p> <p>Nevertheless it is intriguing, and the Chancellor's overlordship of this area must contribute to what some insiders fear is a duumvirate that could collapse in classic Roman style. </p> <p>Some people are making comparisons with the Thatcher/Lawson/Walters era. In some ways the tension between Nos 10 and 11 Downing Street is not as bad as it was then; but in others it is even worse. Unlike Brown, Lawson never took himself seriously as being prime minister material - although there was a moment, when he was being feted as the Greatest Chancellor, when others began to take him seriously. </p> <p>Thatcher did not take kindly to that kind of thing. Nevertheless, she was genuinely bemused by Lawson's resentment of Walters; and, people forget, Lawson was not fired. He resigned, in considerable style, on a day when his senior officials thought they had safely packed him off to Germany. </p> <p>The general view is that Blair certainly cannot afford to lose Brown from the Treasury this side of the election; Whitehall seems to be more divided on whether the Chancellor is a racing certainty to be reappointed after the election (if Labour wins) or will be put on the spot by being offered the Foreign Office. </p> <p>Geoffrey Howe was happy to move to the Foreign Office after the 1983 election. Thatcher, too, thought the time had come and noted: 'It seems a kind of psychological law that Chancellors naturally incline towards the Foreign Office.' Indeed she thought it the 'next logical step'. </p> <p>Number 10 has its own views on the Chancellor's psychological laws. Brown may think differently from Howe - as Chancellor he is at the centre of power and no doubt wishes to stay there until he can become prime minister. One watches all this with interest: there seemed a certain 'third way' aspect to Blair's response last week to rumours about his not wanting a full second term - indeed, I thought him somewhat Delphic.

      "bodyText": "One of the less noticed aspects of the torrent of leaks pouring out of the 'Yes Minister' world of Tony Blair's government is the absence of any obvious interest on the part of the Prime Minister in the economy. You could argue that the economy is going so well (the fashionable view, about which I have reservations) that he does not need to concern himself with it. It could also be said that Blair is happy to leave the economy in Gordon Brown's hands. Brown certainly breaks all the rules of the European Union working-time directive in the number of hours he puts in on the economy - although, if it is true that he only begins work at 6am he still has to catch up with Sir Stafford Cripps, Labour Chancellor after Hugh Dalton's 'Budget leak' resignation in 1947, who began work at 5am. If members of this Government had to resign every time there was an embarrassing leak, there would be no Cabinet left by now. No doubt a much smaller cabinet would suit the Prime Minister well, because, as he is finding to his cost, democracy and colleagues can be tiresome when one has ambitions to break the mould of British politics. Nigel Lawson once joked that Thatcher's ideal was a Cabinet of one: herself. Nevertheless, the delegation of almost everything concerned with the economy to the Chancellor (with occasional intervention in things like the minimum wage) is unusual: if one looks back over the past 50 years, Macmillan, Wilson, Heath, Callaghan, Thatcher and Major all took a much greater interest in the economy than Blair seems to. Perhaps there was a greater sense of crisis then. Perhaps it doesn't matter very much. Nevertheless it is intriguing, and the Chancellor's overlordship of this area must contribute to what some insiders fear is a duumvirate that could collapse in classic Roman style. Some people are making comparisons with the Thatcher/Lawson/Walters era. In some ways the tension between Nos 10 and 11 Downing Street is not as bad as it was then; but in others it is even worse. Unlike Brown, Lawson never took himself seriously as being prime minister material - although there was a moment, when he was being feted as the Greatest Chancellor, when others began to take him seriously. Thatcher did not take kindly to that kind of thing. Nevertheless, she was genuinely bemused by Lawson's resentment of Walters; and, people forget, Lawson was not fired. He resigned, in considerable style, on a day when his senior officials thought they had safely packed him off to Germany. The general view is that Blair certainly cannot afford to lose Brown from the Treasury this side of the election; Whitehall seems to be more divided on whether the Chancellor is a racing certainty to be reappointed after the election (if Labour wins) or will be put on the spot by being offered the Foreign Office. Geoffrey Howe was happy to move to the Foreign Office after the 1983 election. Thatcher, too, thought the time had come and noted: 'It seems a kind of psychological law that Chancellors naturally incline towards the Foreign Office.' Indeed she thought it the 'next logical step'. Number 10 has its own views on the Chancellor's psychological laws. Brown may think differently from Howe - as Chancellor he is at the centre of power and no doubt wishes to stay there until he can become prime minister. One watches all this with interest: there seemed a certain 'third way' aspect to Blair's response last week to rumours about his not wanting a full second term - indeed, I thought him somewhat Delphic. But the response was duly spun into a firmer commitment than his words seemed to warrant. There was a time when I wondered whether Brown, too, shared Blair's lack of interest in the economy. That was when, early on, the Chancellor hived off demand management to the Bank of England. But one soon learnt that, among other things, that was to give the Chancellor more time to work on his mission to improve the supply side of the economy, and devise complex schemes to narrow, or at least block, the widening gap between rich and poor. Last week the Chancellor told the parliamentary Treasury Committee that the economic stability he aims at is an 'essential part' of the economic convergence required by his five tests for joining the euro. But a day later the Confederation of British Industry came out with a quarterly trends survey that suggested there was still a lot of 'instability' in the manufacturing sector, caused by the high pound. For, while people's attention has been distracted by leaked memos and fundamental spending reviews, the pound has been creeping up again. The prospects for exports have deteriorated sharply in recent months, new investment plans are weak, and the CBI fears that manufacturing could be in danger of the kind of downturn that would not be too popular with the CBI or electorate. Nick Reilly, head of Vauxhall Motors and of the CBI's economic affairs committee, says there is a lot of evidence that more and more businesses are switching to overseas sources for supplies - hence the recent surge in imports. Kate Barker, the CBI's chief economist, observed: 'People say industry is \"adapting\" as if that were not a problem.' But whereas companies may survive by downsizing their UK operations and buying and investing abroad, that is not much good for the long-term potential of the 'supply side' the Chancellor works on from 5 - sorry 6 - am.

Despite June having seen the worst weather for sales on record, the Swiss-born New York-based model, the face of Wall's Magnum bars, is having a profound impact on the company's bottom line. </p> <p>'Last year we sold around 88 million bars,' said Simon Stevens of Wall's. 'This year we reckon we'll sell more than 150 million bars, up nearly 80 per cent on the pre vious 12 months.' </p> <p>The impact of the Ditzler campaign, which features the model chomping through a Magnum bar and is seen on poster sites across the land, is estimated to have been largely responsible for increasing overall ice cream sales by 7 per cent on the previous year. Surveys show the Magnum series of posters scores the third highest level of consumer awareness after campaigns for mobile phone operator One 2 One and the energy drink Lucozade featuring the video game character Lara Croft. </p> <p>The rise is surprising, considering last month's dreadful weather. In a good week during the summer Wall's would expect to sell 50 million ice creams. Poor weather would see this slashed to around 30 million. The company uses a weather index to gauge conditions for sales. A 100 rating is average; June's rating was 93.9. 'It's never been that low at the half-year - ever,' Stevens said. </p> <p>Unilever seeks to position Magnum as a 'power brand', which can compete with products such as Kit Kat and Walkers Crisps. The company has dramatically increased its Magnum marketing spend from a budget of \u00a32.5 million in 1999 to \u00a37m this year.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Unilever's shareholders may not be familiar with the name Naomie Ditzler, but she is almost the only thing standing between a lousy summer and a slump in ice cream sales at the company's Wall's subsidiary. Despite June having seen the worst weather for sales on record, the Swiss-born New York-based model, the face of Wall's Magnum bars, is having a profound impact on the company's bottom line. 'Last year we sold around 88 million bars,' said Simon Stevens of Wall's. 'This year we reckon we'll sell more than 150 million bars, up nearly 80 per cent on the pre vious 12 months.' The impact of the Ditzler campaign, which features the model chomping through a Magnum bar and is seen on poster sites across the land, is estimated to have been largely responsible for increasing overall ice cream sales by 7 per cent on the previous year. Surveys show the Magnum series of posters scores the third highest level of consumer awareness after campaigns for mobile phone operator One 2 One and the energy drink Lucozade featuring the video game character Lara Croft. The rise is surprising, considering last month's dreadful weather. In a good week during the summer Wall's would expect to sell 50 million ice creams. Poor weather would see this slashed to around 30 million. The company uses a weather index to gauge conditions for sales. A 100 rating is average; June's rating was 93.9. 'It's never been that low at the half-year - ever,' Stevens said. Unilever seeks to position Magnum as a 'power brand', which can compete with products such as Kit Kat and Walkers Crisps. The company has dramatically increased its Magnum marketing spend from a budget of \u00a32.5 million in 1999 to \u00a37m this year.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<b> Rhona BBC2 </b> <br> <b> Glasgow Kiss BBC1 </b> <br> <b> Operation Good Guys BBC2 </b> <br> <b> Friends C4 </b> <p> You can tell we're deep into summer scheduling hell because last week was a very good week for Scots sapphics. Obviously this isn't quite as minority as terrestrial telly drama can get (that'll be in August when, mark my words, there will be subtitled love stories set in Latvian circuses and featuring persons of restricted growth), but I'm sure you'll agree that two wisecracking Scottish lesbians in one week is two more wisecracking Scottish lesbians than you've probably had in your living room all year. Unless, of course, you're a wisecracking Scottish lesbian yourself, in which case your living room is presumably heaving with smart sisters rolling their eyes, tutting and saying: 'Women! Pah! Can't live with 'em... pass that copy of Hustler .' </p> <p> Anyway, the week's first Scottish lesbian was the much-hyped Rhona Cameron bouncing busily around her eponymous sitcom. With a title sequence inspired by the Seventies sitcom Rhoda , friendships inspired by Seinfeld , humour inspired by undergrad surrealism and all of it wrapped up as a cuddly twenty-first century cultural signifier, Rhona practically screamed: 'Look at me! I'm not scary at all, am I? Not relentlessly gay like that Ellen or Queer as Folk .' Indeed, Cameron was clearly at such pains not to make an issue of her gayness that for the lily-livered non-lesbians among us, the show really wasn't gay enough. Take away the prospect of girls snogging in that gaspingly slo-mo porno style that always makes me think goodness-is-that-the-time-already? and what is there left apart from a few cute, Friends -funny lines like: </p> <p> 'If you sleep with your friends who do you complain to about your lovers?' <br> 'Friends you're waiting to sleep with.' </p> <p> (Smart, but wrong. All women, whatever their sexual proclivities, know that the real answer is one's dog.) Still, Rhona-the-show was cute like, say, a wee lesbian mouse tapdancing there on the stair right there and Rhona-the-star tried awfully hard, but unfortunately the combination of Rhona plus Mel Giedroyc and Dave Lamb as her (straight) best friends was so desperately unsexy that when they all ended up in bed together it was a bit like watching Eric and Ernie sharing their queen size with Angela Rippon. </p> <p> The week's second Scottish lesbian cropped up as Iain Glen's housemate (or sister? or friend with a spare set of keys? - who knew?) in Glasgow Kiss, a love story that, having been relegated to scheduling hell, could have been about semi-professional headbutters in the Gorbals but in fact turned out to be a love story between a sports hack and a management consultant set against the backdrop of an ailing Glaswegian tabloid newspaper. On second thoughts, the perfect combination for some volatile romantic headbutting. </p> <p> Despite feisty lines like: 'I cannae find anyone who lasts longer than a leg-wax' and, to Glen: 'You're housetrained, you don't smell, you've get your own teeth. Christ, if you wore a dress I'd shag you meself...' - even when murmuring: 'I must get out more' while leafing through a dusty copy of Mayfair - the lesbian really only existed as a cipher for Glen's character to cry on. None the less, I'm hoping that this fleeting evidence of primetime gal-pal sauciness might give Rhona the confidence to throw an Ann Summers party and invite Denise Van Outen, the girls from Steps, Martina Navratilova and some ex-Gladiators. </p> <p> But the pet lesbian hardly got a look in after the plot kicked off. Glen plays widowed Stuart, a football writer and owner of both a very winsome son and a trampled heart. Meanwhile, single thirtysomething consultant Cara (Sharon Small) has been having an affair with her married boss when he demands some space and dispatches her on a 10-week mission to turn around the fortunes of Glen's ailing paper. Searching for a canteen, Cara is soon spotted by Stuart and his smart-arse colleague who mistakes her for 'the new girl from features'. </p> <p> 'How do you figure that?' <br> 'Well, she's lost. You know what they're like - brown's the new black, stupid's the new clever!' </p> <p> Laugh? I nearly understood the offside rule. Anyway, I assume women are meant to identify with this gimlet-eyed management minxstress, which is unnerving because soon she was coming across like a dyed-in-the-fur boiler of bunnies.

      "bodyText": "Rhona BBC2 Glasgow Kiss BBC1 Operation Good Guys BBC2 Friends C4 You can tell we're deep into summer scheduling hell because last week was a very good week for Scots sapphics. Obviously this isn't quite as minority as terrestrial telly drama can get (that'll be in August when, mark my words, there will be subtitled love stories set in Latvian circuses and featuring persons of restricted growth), but I'm sure you'll agree that two wisecracking Scottish lesbians in one week is two more wisecracking Scottish lesbians than you've probably had in your living room all year. Unless, of course, you're a wisecracking Scottish lesbian yourself, in which case your living room is presumably heaving with smart sisters rolling their eyes, tutting and saying: 'Women! Pah! Can't live with 'em... pass that copy of Hustler .' Anyway, the week's first Scottish lesbian was the much-hyped Rhona Cameron bouncing busily around her eponymous sitcom. With a title sequence inspired by the Seventies sitcom Rhoda , friendships inspired by Seinfeld , humour inspired by undergrad surrealism and all of it wrapped up as a cuddly twenty-first century cultural signifier, Rhona practically screamed: 'Look at me! I'm not scary at all, am I? Not relentlessly gay like that Ellen or Queer as Folk .' Indeed, Cameron was clearly at such pains not to make an issue of her gayness that for the lily-livered non-lesbians among us, the show really wasn't gay enough. Take away the prospect of girls snogging in that gaspingly slo-mo porno style that always makes me think goodness-is-that-the-time-already? and what is there left apart from a few cute, Friends -funny lines like: 'If you sleep with your friends who do you complain to about your lovers?' 'Friends you're waiting to sleep with.' (Smart, but wrong. All women, whatever their sexual proclivities, know that the real answer is one's dog.) Still, Rhona-the-show was cute like, say, a wee lesbian mouse tapdancing there on the stair right there and Rhona-the-star tried awfully hard, but unfortunately the combination of Rhona plus Mel Giedroyc and Dave Lamb as her (straight) best friends was so desperately unsexy that when they all ended up in bed together it was a bit like watching Eric and Ernie sharing their queen size with Angela Rippon. The week's second Scottish lesbian cropped up as Iain Glen's housemate (or sister? or friend with a spare set of keys? - who knew?) in Glasgow Kiss, a love story that, having been relegated to scheduling hell, could have been about semi-professional headbutters in the Gorbals but in fact turned out to be a love story between a sports hack and a management consultant set against the backdrop of an ailing Glaswegian tabloid newspaper. On second thoughts, the perfect combination for some volatile romantic headbutting. Despite feisty lines like: 'I cannae find anyone who lasts longer than a leg-wax' and, to Glen: 'You're housetrained, you don't smell, you've get your own teeth. Christ, if you wore a dress I'd shag you meself...' - even when murmuring: 'I must get out more' while leafing through a dusty copy of Mayfair - the lesbian really only existed as a cipher for Glen's character to cry on. None the less, I'm hoping that this fleeting evidence of primetime gal-pal sauciness might give Rhona the confidence to throw an Ann Summers party and invite Denise Van Outen, the girls from Steps, Martina Navratilova and some ex-Gladiators. But the pet lesbian hardly got a look in after the plot kicked off. Glen plays widowed Stuart, a football writer and owner of both a very winsome son and a trampled heart. Meanwhile, single thirtysomething consultant Cara (Sharon Small) has been having an affair with her married boss when he demands some space and dispatches her on a 10-week mission to turn around the fortunes of Glen's ailing paper. Searching for a canteen, Cara is soon spotted by Stuart and his smart-arse colleague who mistakes her for 'the new girl from features'. 'How do you figure that?' 'Well, she's lost. You know what they're like - brown's the new black, stupid's the new clever!' Laugh? I nearly understood the offside rule. Anyway, I assume women are meant to identify with this gimlet-eyed management minxstress, which is unnerving because soon she was coming across like a dyed-in-the-fur boiler of bunnies. At the leaving do for a squealing bimbette from features, which apparently got itself confused with a hen night (complete with gifts of small plastic penises on legs and stripping policemen), Cara copped off with Stuart after establishing he was single. Later, post-coitally, back at his place, in the middle of the night, apropos of nothing, she whispered: 'Stuart, do you think I look happy?' In the real world, this is the sort of feminine behaviour that sends the average adult male straight into the arms of an uncomplicated younger woman who is 'a bit of a laugh' and probably keeps a small plastic penis with legs Blu-Tacked to the top of her computer. But despite failing this test and being very lucky not to get kicked out of his bed, Cara was soon poking around Stuart's bathroom cabinet, discovering boxes of Tampax and bottles of Chanel. Thus gripped with the mania that comes of discovering the man with whom you've just had a one-night stand might not actually be a virgin, Cara was soon fossicking in wardrobes, finding frocks, dried bouquets and wedding photographs. Naturally, seconds later, she was also pacing Stuart's kitchen and spraying the words LYING BASTARD on his walls.

As the credits rolled, Stuart was to be seen weeping and sniffing his dead wife's clothes. Don't really want to go there? No, me neither! In fact, rather than watch Cara and Stuart hurtle toward their unfeasibly happy ending, I rather fancy spending the next six Tuesday nights curled up on the sofa with the dog, a copy of Anthony Clare's On Men: Masculinity in Crisis and a tub of Ben and Jerry's Chubby Hubby ice cream.

One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a hippy old piece, full of heart and full of holes. But as directed by Terry Kinney, a co-founder of the company, it storms along. </p> <p>Dale Wasserman's play, based on the novel by Ken Kesey, was first performed in 1970 and made famous by Milos Forman's 1975 screen version starring Jack Nicholson. Its story - of a sane man who goes into a mental asylum to escape criminal charges and awakens its institutionalised patients to the knowledge of their abuse - is a real Sixties' creation. The authorities are repressive; the inmates are victims of the system; hardly anyone is really mad or dangerous. There is an amiable giant watching a flock of geese. </p> <p>The play is a study of society in miniature. It has the anger and the kindness of the era. It also has a cruel blank spot: it's difficult to imagine anyone nowadays so confidently pitting the rights of a band of full-blooded fellows against an emasculating spinster. </p> <p>The point of Steppenwolf is the company's wonderful pulling together: no nook of the stage is dead; everyone is always concentrated; something is always on the move; it makes you realise that stretches of most productions are vacant. </p> <p>But the point of the play is anti-ensemble - it celebrates an individual's power to disrupt and change. And there's no question that a considerable part of the evening's power comes from the brimming-over energy of another Steppenwolf founder. Gary Sinise makes the Jack Nicholson part his own - he's so bristlingly full of himself as he struts around in his denims and lumberjack shirt that you feel his temperature rising. In one memorable moment, as he tries - and fails - to exercise his power, his whole face changes colour. </p> <p>He helps make the play an infinitely more subtle occasion than Forman's film. As does Amy Morton, who plays the tyrant nurse with level-toned, syrupy compassion. You believe she believes in what's she doing, which make her much more dangerous. Anyone interested in acting should see this play. </p> <p>This should have been a good month for another American playwright. The National is staging a full-on production of one of Arthur Miller's best-known plays, All My Sons . And now the Almeida has provided an English platform for a piece written 50 years later, and first seen in the US two years ago. </p> <p>But Mr Peters' Connections is a dreary occasion. An elderly man's after-dinner sleep takes him into a limbo in which the past and present, the living and the dead, fact and speculation become jumbled, as fragments of his life occur to him. His middle-aged wife appears, as does the ghost of a young lover. Played here as a curvy, fur-clad blonde, she inevitably evokes Monroe - and if Miller had wanted to avoid any possibility of an association with Norma Jean, he might have called her something less double-barrelled than Cathy-May. A young couple chat in a modern vocabulary which baffles him; a dead brother reminds him of halcyon days. In one corner, an all-seeing black hobo cackles and lets loose an occasional irritating general statement. </p> <p>More than once, Mr Peters complains of a bewildering fluency in himself and others, and of an inability to find in this torrent of words a real subject-matter. It's a complaint that, not unreasonably, extends beyond his own troubles to embrace the condition of America. </p> <p>The trouble is that the play merely mimics these complaints. It's all meander. Spurts of epigrams - 'I was never conservative enough to be a communist' - don't add up to an argument. A sentimental lurch at the end doesn't amount to a conclusion. Michael Blakemore's production creeps along. Peter J. Davison's design is awkward rather than unsettling: skyscrapers slant away in the background without looking vertiginous; a pile of furniture in one corner looks like a tidy person's attempt at putting a muddle together. As Mr Peters, John Cullum looks - as well he may - perplexed but never threatened. </p> <p>The Bridewell Theatre has two musical modes. There's new and daring. This is the theatre that has brought the British musical a new, blue-grass hope by presenting the work of Richard Rogers's grandson, Adam Guettel. And there's assured and elegant - as in the new Sond heim tribute, Moving On. Twenty-five years ago, David Kernan created a hit with Side by Side by Sondheim . The new revue, which he has devised and directed, includes the composer's more recent work. </p> <p> Moving On is a crisp and sweetly caustic night's music. The songs of the urban ironist, who hymns the delights of a place with 'grass on the sidewalk but not in the park', are staged on a series of wide steps bathed in mauve light, with a stiff line of ornamental trees in the background. Five singers glide, and, in one instance, tap-dance, over these, declaring their friendship as they pointedly upstage each other. </p> <p>The evening takes in 18 shows, including Gypsy, West Side Story, Into the Woods and A Little Night Music. It's pretty much undiluted love - though love with a wry grin clamped on its face. It also takes in quite a lot of Sondheim. Huge photographs of the composer hang at the back of the stage: chubby in a stiff collar as a small boy; trim in epaulettes; looking up from his piano into the camera as a smooth-cheeked youth; looking away from his photographer at the keyboard as a grizzled and bearded adult. </p> <p>Sondheim's words provide links between songs. There are nuggets for addicts as he remembers placing his hand on his father's little finger when he played the piano. </p> <p>There is some dross for non-fans: long and happy marriages, opines the wordsmith, are 'lucky and unusual happenstance'.</p>",

The rest of his programme, though, could hardly have been more British, more Proms: Elgar's Sea Pictures , sung with poise by Louise Winter; and Holst's The Planets , robustly played and with the addition of Colin Matthews's six-minute coda, 'Pluto the Renewer', receiving its London premiere. </p> <p>No doubt there were many present who wanted to applaud Holst's 'Neptune' ending, but the way the violin seamlessly grafts Matthews's addendum on to the original denies them that pleasure. 'Pluto' begins low and slow, the trombones ominous, but it soon gallops away. ('Solar winds were my starting point,' says Matthews.) Twinkling strings, flutes and celesta create a suitably spacey atmosphere, raucously interrupted by brass and timpani. Then, reconnecting with the main work, Matthews introduces, for the briefest moment, the ghostly offstage chorus of Holst's last movement. The Planets will survive without it, but 'Pluto' is a worthy homage. </p> <p>The previous evening, Peter Maxwell Davies conducted the London premiere of his Seventh Symphony in a performance by the BBC Philharmonic. The composer feels that the Seventh is the last in a cycle, from which the promised Eighth will stand apart, and his programme note acknowledges the influence of Haydn's symphonies and quartets, discernible, perhaps, in a certain good humour that continually bubbles to the surface. The symphony requires no fewer than six percussionists, but did not feel percussion-heavy. Indeed, the tiny rhythmic filigrees for cymbal and the melancholy little trumpet statements that punctuated the piece had an airy, jazzy feel, while the final movement had several fragments of what I can only call tunes. </p> <p>No great fan of Max's sym phonies, I was gripped for most of its 45 minutes. Its fits and starts seemed eminently dramatic, from the busy rush of the introduction to the single trumpet parp which brings the work to a sudden and apparently provisional close. Maxwell Davies is never the most elegant of conductors, and his podium exer tions left him visibly exhausted, but he communicates well with these players, for whom the Seventh is a kind of valedictory tribute. </p> <p>Last Tuesday, the BBC National Orchestra of Wales under Tadaaki Otaka gave the world premiere of Rhian Samuel's Tirluniau (Landscapes) . Samuel provides all but Ordnance Survey grid references for the locations that inspired her, but these matter less than the landscape she herself creates. In the opening movement, 'Cromlech', the piquant combination of xylophone and piccolo hovered over sighing strings that in the second movement ('The Old Man of Storr') seemed to be reassembling shards of Debussy's Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande . </p> <p>Samuel suggests that the third movement, 'Castell y Bere', ends in 'the cold resignation of despair'. That isn't how it felt to me: the effusive melody that had spread through the orchestra had too much life for that, and prepared the way for the exuberantly urban, almost minimalist surge of the final section, 'Lights in the Bay'. The orchestra dead? Not on the evidence of these four pieces. </p> <p>\u0095 Last Tuesday's Prom is rebroadcast at 2pm tomorrow on Radio 3 </p> <p>\u0095 Fiona Maddocks is away</p>",

      "body": "<p>Julian Barratt and Noel Fielding are just good friends. Well, not just good friends: they are also The Boosh, the hippest, hottest comedy duo in the country. They have been to Edinburgh twice. In their first year, as The Mighty Boosh , they won the Perrier Best Newcomer award. In their second year, as Arctic Boosh , they were nominated for the award proper. This year, with a radio show in the pipeline, and 'TV people seriously interested', they are strong favourites to win the Perrier and become the first millennial youth icons of British comedy. You hate them, don't you? </p> <p>Don't. I know it sounds sickly, all this youth and good looks and hipness. I know they're featured in magazines such as the Face and Jockey Slut , and they have the kind of just-got-out-of-bed haircuts that require 30 minutes' preparation every morning... but The Boosh are not like that, really. Certainly, they have a tastefulness in fashion, films and music alien to most comics (who traditionally prefer brown suits, Carry On Up the Khyber and Oasis), and a pop-starry charisma alien to most pop stars these days. But they also have talent, a work ethic and an interpersonal chemistry. </p> <p>So... just good friends. During the photoshoot, as they fondle each other's 'man-boobs' and chat in low tones, I mention the H-word: homoerotic. Fielding, the 27-year-old, long-haired, narcissistic, elfin one with the mockney accent, flinches. The 'gay love' aspect of their partnership has been overemphasised, he complains, seemingly unaware that he looks exactly like Mark Owen, the 'cute one' from Take That. </p> <p>None the less, there is definitely a core of mutual affection and understanding between Barratt and Fielding. 'I think almost all of our chemistry as a duo is down to being close friends,' nods Barratt, the 32-year-old, tall, brooding, existentially troubled one with the rich Yorkshire accent (whom you may recognise from the Metz television advert, where he plays a 'freelance scientist' who talks about 'the judder'). He laughs bitterly. 'After all, we spend every fucking day together! We play tennis and hang out. If you took away the affection, you'd remove a big part of the dynamic.' </p> <p>You play tennis? 'Yeah,' Fielding smiles, 'we're doubles partners, we play against the guys from Sneaker Pimps [with whom Barratt lives]. He's got really powerful groundstrokes and I'm the master of the net.' </p> <p>Do you have girlfriends? They both smile knowingly. 'Yeah, and they both joke about us being married,' says Fielding. Pause. 'And the sex gets on their nerves a bit,' Barratt adds, scratching his nose. </p> <p>This is as close to a conventional gag as The Boosh get, either in interview or on stage. In conversation, they are, like most comedians, unremittingly intense and sincere. As for their show... well, it's hard to describe, but one thing it's not is conventional comedy. They've been compared to Morecambe and Wise and Alice in Wonderland, Reeves and Mortimer and Beckett; they've been labelled Dadaist, surrealist, and plain goddamn weird. </p> <p>Their debut Edinburgh show, The Mighty Boosh , was a loose ragbag of non-sequiturs and postmodern slapstick, based around a narrative in which two zookeepers are sucked through their boss's eye into a jungle. Last year's Arctic Boosh was more structured and mature, featuring a sweet-and-sour love story of two postmen and their quest to find a magic egg in the North Pole. </p> <p>This year's show, which I saw as a work-in-progress at London's Riverside Studios two weeks ago, is noticeably darker. Entitled Auto Boosh , it is the tale of two friends going on holiday to a country cottage. Barratt's character, depressed by his sidekick's cheeky whims, drives off and picks up a psychotic hitch-hiker seemingly modelled on the scary character from The Shamen's 'Ebeneezer Goode' video. Conducted mostly in half-darkness, it descends into a child's nightmare - Chitty Chitty Bang Bang meets Blue Velvet . </p> <p>'Yeah, it is a bit darker,' muses Barratt. 'We didn't want to repeat ourselves, but we wanted to maintain the Booshness of it... it's been really difficult to write, this one. In fact,' he says, rubbing a bloodshot eye with the ball of his thumb, 'the last two months have probably been the hardest of my life.' </p> <p>'We kept changing our minds about where we wanted it to go,' Fielding elaborates. 'It's been quite tortuous, actually.' </p> <p>(They don't mention the pressure, but their publicist acknowledges that there is a huge expectation this year. 'They're at a point where, if they don't win the Perrier, it will look like a disappointment,' she says.) </p> <p>'We always have loads of weird coincidences when we write a show,' says Fielding, sounding slightly unhinged. Everything's been eyes recently...' </p> <p>'I play the rationalist card,' Barratt interposes. 'Your mind is so focused on the show that everything becomes linked with it...' </p> <p>'Our characters are boiling, they're bleeding...' </p> <p>By now, they are talking over each other, sounding ever more manic and making hardly any sense at all. I ask about their new 'third member', Dave, who does neither photographs nor interviews, but plays several important characters in the show. </p> <p>Fielding's eyes go all gooey. 'Dave's really positive and happy,' he smiles. 'Or rather, he was until he got involved with us. Working with me and Julian, it's all black, fizzing nightmares.' </p> <p>\u0095 Auto Boosh is at Pleasance Two, 7.30pm, 2-28 August</p>",

In fact,' he says, rubbing a bloodshot eye with the ball of his thumb, 'the last two months have probably been the hardest of my life.' 'We kept changing our minds about where we wanted it to go,' Fielding elaborates. 'It's been quite tortuous, actually.' (They don't mention the pressure, but their publicist acknowledges that there is a huge expectation this year. 'They're at a point where, if they don't win the Perrier, it will look like a disappointment,' she says.) 'We always have loads of weird coincidences when we write a show,' says Fielding, sounding slightly unhinged. Everything's been eyes recently...' 'I play the rationalist card,' Barratt interposes. 'Your mind is so focused on the show that everything becomes linked with it...' 'Our characters are boiling, they're bleeding...' By now, they are talking over each other, sounding ever more manic and making hardly any sense at all. I ask about their new 'third member', Dave, who does neither photographs nor interviews, but plays several important characters in the show. Fielding's eyes go all gooey. 'Dave's really positive and happy,' he smiles. 'Or rather, he was until he got involved with us. Working with me and Julian, it's all black, fizzing nightmares.' \u0095 Auto Boosh is at Pleasance Two, 7.30pm, 2-28 August",

Last week, with tickets costing up to \u00a350 each, it packed the Royal Festival Hall for two nights. </p> <p>This was Jarrett's first British appearance since 1992, and he was reportedly still recovering from the debilitating ME which had kept him from performing for the past four years. No one knew what to expect. In the event, the concert, though understandably quite short, was a triumph. </p> <p>It started with a surprise. For the whole first half, not even the briefest wisp of a standard tune surfaced in the Standards Trio's performance. Instead, they followed the typical Jarrett impro method - like lighting a fire using a match and a few small twigs and gradually adding to it until you have a good blaze going. A tiny phrase, a handful of notes, was all it took to set them off on a half-hour journey through a constantly changing landscape. </p> <p>The group looks like a conventional piano-bass-drums jazz trio, and it can play conventional jazz trio music superbly, but can also do a great deal more. There are, for instance, very few solos. Instead, the focus is in constant motion. On a few occasions, DeJohnette's drums actually dictated the melody while Jarrett supplied percussion on the top notes of the keyboard. At one point, this became so outrageous that they both burst out laughing and Jarrett ended it by banging the piano lid down. Their friendship goes back to 1966, when Jarrett was 20 and DeJohnette 23. It shows. </p> <p>When Jarrett is playing, he is possessed by the music and this is reflected in his body language. He plays standing up most of the time, sometimes bending his head right inside the piano. At other times, he leans far back on the piano stool, twists his body, kicks his legs out straight. It all seems quite normal after a while, partly because the gyrations reflect what is going on in the music. There was one particularly glorious passage, which started as a grave, hymn-like tune, complete with solid Victorian harmonies (leaning back, chin in the air). Gradually, this mutated into passionate, gospel-soul (standing, shaking head) until dying away in a sequence of quiet, minor-key chords (sitting, nose almost touching keys). </p> <p>A few standards finally emerged towards the end of the concert, to the obvious delight of the crowd. Even here, Jarrett's phrasing is impossibly slippery and asymmetrical, yet exquisitely simple and clear, too.

      "body": "<p><strong> The Perfect Storm </strong> (129 mins, 12) Directed by Wolfgang Petersen; starring George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, John C. Reilly </p> <p>Wolfgang Peterson's vivid account of life aboard a German submarine in the Second World War, Das Boot, is one of the great movies about seafaring. His new film, The Perfect Storm, though not quite in the same class, is, nevertheless, fit to be moored alongside it. </p> <p>The film is adapted by Bill Wittliff from Sebastian Junger's riveting documentary book about 'the storm of the century' that occurred around Hallowe'en 1991, when a hurricane moving north from Bermuda collided off the north-west coast of America with an Arctic blast moving south and an unusual cold front coming across Canada from the Great Lakes. In this context 'perfect' is an ironic meteorological term meaning 'the worst imaginable'. </p> <p>At the centre of the book and the film is a swordfishing boat, the Andrea Gail, working the Grand Banks from the port of Gloucester, Massachusetts, where the walls of the old town hall, seen in the opening sequence, record the names of the 10,000 fishermen lost at sea since 1623. We're introduced to the ship's captain, Billy Tyne (George Clooney), and his crew as they return with a catch much inferior to that of a friendly rival, the Hannah Boden, skippered by Linda Greenlaw (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio). </p> <p>Is Tyne's luck running out? Is the Grand Banks fishing ground becoming depleted? The crew are disappointed with their rewards, the owner of the Andrea Gail (unsympathetic Michael Ironside) sneers at the captain he employs. In consequence, Tyne decides to put to sea again two days later in a last attempt to retrieve a bad season. </p> <p> The Perfect Storm is much influenced by Howard Hawks. It's the story of dedicated professionals who work together at dangerous jobs, respecting each other's skills. Fishing is what they do - because they love it or because it promised to pay well or because it's all they know. The women stoically stand by or they act like the men (Mastrantonio is an archetypal Hawksian woman) or they go away. </p> <p>Most of the men are either anguished divorc\u00e9s, dedicated loners or on the point of giving up the sea for a woman. In a traditional scene at their gathering place, the Crow's Nest Tavern, their characters are established ready for the central business of the film - the effects of the storm. Like miners, they belong to a close community that practises a physically demanding trade living with memories of tragedies and knowing that disaster might strike any time. </p> <p>Eventually, the Andrea Gail puts out to sea, John Seale's photography giving the movie a crisp, clear, bracing feel, James Horner's emphatic score underlining the heroic aspect of the adventure. At first, the fish are brought in steadily on the 40 mile-long nets. But there's conflict between the unhappy Murph (John C. Reilly) and the difficult newcomer Sully (William Fichtner), which is broken up by the reliable Bugsy (John Hawkes) and the happy-go-lucky Jamaican, Alfred Pierre (Allen Payne). </p> <p>Then a shark they accidentally land injures the first mate, Bobby (Mark Wahlberg) and Murph is dragged overboard and nearly killed. When the catch drastically falls off, Tyne persuades them to go further out to a better fishing ground. Meanwhile, the meteorologist at a Boston TV station starts noticing the freak weather pattern. </p> <p>This is a story of man against an implacable, remorseless nature, not a factitious tale of confronting sea monsters or waterborne terrorists. But at its centre are the effects of economic imperatives. The boat is out because the crew need the money, and at a crucial juncture the ice-making machinery breaks down because of the owner's cost-cutting, so no more fish can be taken. </p> <p>A choice arises between heading home through the storm with their catch or evading the storm by going further out and thus having to ditch a catch they can't preserve. The voyage begins with them thinking of their living; it ends with them fighting for their lives. </p> <p>The storm is a stunning, gut-wrenching piece of film-making that leaves the spectator shattered. Petersen cuts between the community's agonies on land in Gloucester and the events at sea. In addition to the Andrea Gail, there's a foundering yacht to be helped, a rescue helicopter in desperate need of aerial re-fuelling, a merchant ship whose containers are being swept away like so many Lego bricks, and the Hannah Boden from which Greenlaw is relaying messages to the increasingly isolated Andrea Gail. The special effects are astonishing, but they never detract from the human story, which is old-fashioned in the finest sense. </p> <p>The cast look like real working men who've lived hard, open-air lives. Their dialogue is laconic and given our postmodern times and the fact that even at sea they watch a lot of action videos, they are perhaps aware of the roles they act out. After one fisherman is thanked by a hostile colleague whose life he's helped save, he remarks: 'You'd have done the same for me - isn't that what I'm supposed to say?' </p> <p>I was caught up in this movie far more than I was in Jaws and there's a memorial service in the Gloucester church that is every bit as moving as the funeral of Spencer Tracy in Captains Courageous, a picture that inevitably comes to mind. The first chapter of Junger's book has an unforgettable epigraph from Walter Scott's novel, The Antiquary : 'It's no fish ye're buying, it's men's lives.' I wish they'd quoted this in the film.</p>",

At the centre of the book and the film is a swordfishing boat, the Andrea Gail, working the Grand Banks from the port of Gloucester, Massachusetts, where the walls of the old town hall, seen in the opening sequence, record the names of the 10,000 fishermen lost at sea since 1623. We're introduced to the ship's captain, Billy Tyne (George Clooney), and his crew as they return with a catch much inferior to that of a friendly rival, the Hannah Boden, skippered by Linda Greenlaw (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio). Is Tyne's luck running out? Is the Grand Banks fishing ground becoming depleted? The crew are disappointed with their rewards, the owner of the Andrea Gail (unsympathetic Michael Ironside) sneers at the captain he employs. In consequence, Tyne decides to put to sea again two days later in a last attempt to retrieve a bad season. The Perfect Storm is much influenced by Howard Hawks. It's the story of dedicated professionals who work together at dangerous jobs, respecting each other's skills. Fishing is what they do - because they love it or because it promised to pay well or because it's all they know. The women stoically stand by or they act like the men (Mastrantonio is an archetypal Hawksian woman) or they go away. Most of the men are either anguished divorc\u00e9s, dedicated loners or on the point of giving up the sea for a woman. In a traditional scene at their gathering place, the Crow's Nest Tavern, their characters are established ready for the central business of the film - the effects of the storm. Like miners, they belong to a close community that practises a physically demanding trade living with memories of tragedies and knowing that disaster might strike any time. Eventually, the Andrea Gail puts out to sea, John Seale's photography giving the movie a crisp, clear, bracing feel, James Horner's emphatic score underlining the heroic aspect of the adventure. At first, the fish are brought in steadily on the 40 mile-long nets. But there's conflict between the unhappy Murph (John C. Reilly) and the difficult newcomer Sully (William Fichtner), which is broken up by the reliable Bugsy (John Hawkes) and the happy-go-lucky Jamaican, Alfred Pierre (Allen Payne). Then a shark they accidentally land injures the first mate, Bobby (Mark Wahlberg) and Murph is dragged overboard and nearly killed. When the catch drastically falls off, Tyne persuades them to go further out to a better fishing ground. Meanwhile, the meteorologist at a Boston TV station starts noticing the freak weather pattern. This is a story of man against an implacable, remorseless nature, not a factitious tale of confronting sea monsters or waterborne terrorists. But at its centre are the effects of economic imperatives. The boat is out because the crew need the money, and at a crucial juncture the ice-making machinery breaks down because of the owner's cost-cutting, so no more fish can be taken. A choice arises between heading home through the storm with their catch or evading the storm by going further out and thus having to ditch a catch they can't preserve. The voyage begins with them thinking of their living; it ends with them fighting for their lives. The storm is a stunning, gut-wrenching piece of film-making that leaves the spectator shattered. Petersen cuts between the community's agonies on land in Gloucester and the events at sea. In addition to the Andrea Gail, there's a foundering yacht to be helped, a rescue helicopter in desperate need of aerial re-fuelling, a merchant ship whose containers are being swept away like so many Lego bricks, and the Hannah Boden from which Greenlaw is relaying messages to the increasingly isolated Andrea Gail. The special effects are astonishing, but they never detract from the human story, which is old-fashioned in the finest sense. The cast look like real working men who've lived hard, open-air lives. Their dialogue is laconic and given our postmodern times and the fact that even at sea they watch a lot of action videos, they are perhaps aware of the roles they act out. After one fisherman is thanked by a hostile colleague whose life he's helped save, he remarks: 'You'd have done the same for me - isn't that what I'm supposed to say?' I was caught up in this movie far more than I was in Jaws and there's a memorial service in the Gloucester church that is every bit as moving as the funeral of Spencer Tracy in Captains Courageous, a picture that inevitably comes to mind. The first chapter of Junger's book has an unforgettable epigraph from Walter Scott's novel, The Antiquary : 'It's no fish ye're buying, it's men's lives.' I wish they'd quoted this in the film.",

She had to scrape together the \u00a3200 entry fee and, second time around, the gamble has paid off. 'Bloody hell... God... wow,' she says softly, poring over my crumpled bit of Guardian . Nearly all the papers concentrated on the 26-year-old singer-songwriter from Liverpool who made her first album for \u00a380 and runs her own label from the spare room of her terraced house in Newcastle. Fellow nominee Richard Ashcroft hardly got a look-in. </p> <p>Williams is occupying the novelty space given over in recent years to the token folkie on the list of 12 - Kate Rusby, Eliza Carthy, Norma Waterson - except she isn't a folk singer. 'There's no tradition in what I do,' she says, almost apologetically, in a small, Scouse voice softened by a few years on Tyneside. 'There's no tradition in the lyrics, in the sort of chords I use or anything. I just happen to use an acoustic guitar and sing quietly.' </p> <p>It is the still, clear quiet of her delivery that has had critics rolling over. Her nominated second album, Little Black Numbers (Caw Records) is a set of melancholy, introspective songs - most begin 'I' or 'You' - backed by double bass, cello, percussion, the odd saxophone riff and shimmer of Hammond organ. Van Morrison's Astral Weeks is an obvi ous touchstone, up there with Joni Mitchell, Carole King, Bob Dylan. Her lyrics are meaningful in a vague sort of way: The opening line is: 'You said clich\u00e9s come from the truth/ Of beauty everyone feels they can own.' </p> <p>At her Camden Town gig last Thursday, rapt twentysomethings sat on the floor like infants for storytime, nodding proprietorially, hugging their knees. 'The album was made with emotion. I try and sing it every time with emotion. If I'm putting all that effort in, you should cry,' she tells me, with pretend menace. </p> <p>Williams still seems shellshocked after yesterday's media scrum. We're sitting at either end of a big sofa in her PR's office; her head is sunk into her shoulders and she's holding her arms together in front of her as if I may be about to hit her. 'I'm not in it to be famous,' she says, sinking further into the cushions. 'I love my life. It's simple, quiet. Some would say boring as hell - a nice night in with a pizza and the telly and the cats, a walk on the beach. And this is my job and now I'm a bit scared.' </p> <p>This is the woman who has boldly rejected the lucrative advances of every A&amp;R person in London. 'Someone heard \"Soul to Feet\" and said, \"Can you write seven or eight more like that one?\"' she says, remembering one of the more dismal encounters. 'I choose to have control and no money. I'm not on a crusade. All I'm doing is putting the music and myself first.' </p> <p>She agrees that penury concentrates the creative mind. Her double bassist tries to sound like a theremin on 'Fell Down Fast'; Laura Reid, her cello collaborator, simulates feedback. But having no money is 'a worry... if I can sell about another three or four thousand albums, I'll be just about sorted as far as debts are concerned'. </p> <p>If she won the \u00a320,000 Mercury Prize in September, (she is currently the 20-1 outsider) she would tax and MOT the car, go on a foreign holiday with her boyfriend. 'It's a hell of a lot of money,' she says. 'I'd be able to make a new album. It's half written. I don't want to be a charity case - \"she should win it cos she's poor\" - and I don't think I will win. I'm just writing songs; I'm not trying to be astounding.' </p> <p>Kathryn Williams, mistress of self-deprecation, moved from Liverpool to Newcastle to study art, gave up gouache for the guitar, and spent a year in bed writing songs. Her big break came last autumn at the Barbican's tribute evening to Nick Drake. Way down the bill, she stole the show before she opened her mouth to sing 'Summer Sun', by virtue of being so visibly terrified. 'I went to get my coat and they said you're on, and they put the guitar in my hands and basically pushed me towards the stage. It was like floor-to-ceiling people and then the orchestra didn't start... I was meant to give the cue... when I got off stage, it was amazing, the sound of clapping, it was deafening.' </p> <p>After the Barbican, P.J. Harvey's engineer, Head, offered to be her producer and her lo-fi became inten tional. 'Head always says that hiss is our friend,' she laughs. 'You let imperfections go by if there's an emotion there.' </p> <p>Often in her songs, feeling seems to stem from a sense of being wronged. 'I think it's the only way that I can be that honest and say, \"Look, you are a fucking wanker, fuck off\", because if I saw them on the street I'd go \"Hi!\"' Otherwise, her songs are about the little things in life: 'Why am I here?; Do I believe in a god or don't I?; What's the point of me?... you know, just things.' </p> <p>She must find the Queen of Bedsit Angst' tag annoying. 'Well, yeah,' she says, pulling herself out of the sofa finally. She says that Leonard Cohen has the same problem (not the queen bit), even though he's quite humorous really. So if she were to sum herself up? 'If I was to sum myself up, I'd say 20-1.'</p>",

      "body": "<p>In 1966 it was The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, the election of Harold Wilson, and the start of the great psychedelic trip. In 1977 it was the Sex Pistols and The Clash, the early rise of Margaret Thatcher and the death of Elvis Presley. In 1983 it was Duran Duran and Culture Club, Union Jacks in the street and the impending demise of heavy industry. Over the past 35 years the nation's favourite bands have been more than just signals of changing fashion; they have served as little mirrors to the nation itself. </p> <p>I was thinking about this as I listened to 'Yellow', the current hit single by Coldplay, on the car radio. It was followed by the usual hurried, bellowed Radio 1 news segment: reports on the latest disillusioning government leak and the mountain of flowers and teddy bears growing near the spot where Sarah Payne's body was found. Beside me on the passenger seat, the Daily Mail 's front page screamed for 'the return of hanging'. In the traffic-jammed street where I drove in first gear, rain fell monotonously. The sky was a clammy grey. </p> <p>The middle of July, and Britain felt shrivelled, unhappy, stuck in a twentieth-century timewarp (another politician letting us down, another explosion of sentimental grief for a stranger, another clamour to bring back the noose). And in the midst of this sad drip-drip-drip of leaks and drizzle, the nation's favourite band is... Coldplay, No 1 in the album charts and freshly nominated for the Mercury Music Prize with their debut, Parachutes. Coldplay are a taciturn, introverted, melancholic group of young men from Oxford; their music sounds like the eternal muted sigh of English desperation. </p> <p>Alongside Coldplay at the top of the album charts are David Gray, another Englishman peddling low-key melancholia, and Travis, who have dominated the past 12 months with their wistful Scottish ballads. 'Why Does It Always Rain On Me?' Fran Healy sings... and a nation sings mournfully along. </p> <p>Of course Coldplay et al are not the only sound of Britain in 2000. At the opposite extreme is the whooshing, good-time vibe of UK garage, and somewhere between them the perpetual stream of vacuous boy bands and teen queens selling sex and sentimentality to young children. But this divide is in itself indicative of a regressive change in British music in recent years: the segregation of rock and dance, which at one time seemed destined to interbreed with glorious results. Coldplay is what rock sounds like with all groove, happiness and hipness removed. </p> <p>Think back 10 years. There were riots on the streets in protest at the poll tax, Thatcher was on her way out, and Britain's favourite rock bands were Happy Mondays and Stone Roses, two 'Madchester' groups whose guitar-bass-drums sound was looped into the euphoric vibes and electronic beats of acid house. The year began with the Roses' mighty 'Fools Gold' single and ripened into a summer of Gazzamania, Ibizan all-nighters and the Mondays' languid masterpiece, Pills'n'Thrills &amp; Bellyaches. Under Tory rule, in the depths of economic depression, this was the sound of the counterculture, rebellious and hedonistic. </p> <p>The following year was darker in tone, more progressive musically. While grunge skidded over like a dark cloud from Seattle and Operation Desert Storm turned warfare into 24-hour entertainment, British bands reached a new peak of experimentation. Primal Scream, formerly retro guitar losers, collaborated with DJ Andy Weatherall on Screamadelica, which still sounds futuristic nine years on. Meanwhile Massive Attack (whose very name was banned from broadcast during the Gulf war) brought songs and soulfulness to clubland. The future seemed bright. </p> <p>The next two years were disappointing. America ruled, in the shape of Nirvana and R.E.M. The Roses, Mondays, Primals and Massive all vanished, leaving us the scant consolation of Stereo MC's, whose million-selling Connected album offered a lighter twist on the rock-dance hybrid. In 1993 - year of Jamie Bulger's murder and IRA bombs in the City of London - the desperate music press went overboard for Suede, and their glam-trash pop debut hit No 1. Image and articulacy became valued currencies again. </p> <p>I remember hearing about Kurt Cobain's suicide on a car radio, driving to Brixton to see Primal Scream. During a dull concert, showcasing the band's retrogressive new album, Bobby Gillespie dedicated a song to Cobain and the music scene seemed suddenly directionless. In hindsight, however, that was the moment Britpop was born: the spectre of grunge was exorcised and, within months, new boys Oasis were being attacked on stage by drunken fans and Blur were top of the charts with Parklife . </p> <p>All sorts of people now claim to hate Parklife - not least Blur themselves, who began to feel trapped inside its more cartoonish moments. Nevertheless, it remains a great album and a time capsule of rare potency. This was the sound of British guitar pop facing up to its own magnificent history and incorporating it into an exciting present of economic boom, social liberalisation, mass hedonism, and the decline and fall of the Conservative Party. But the euphoria let loose darker spirits - nostalgia, laddism, nationalism, corporatism - which would eventually sour and spoil the whole party a couple of years down the line. </p> <p>At the time, though, the sudden elevation into the mainstream was exhilarating. After years of the debate over the nation's favourite band being confined to the letters page of NME, now it was on the Nine O'Clock News, Blur and Oasis battling it out for the No1 singles spot. Pundits stepped over each other to assign symbolism to this spat: it was North versus South, working-class versus middle-class, rock'n'roll yahoos versus art-school snobs. But the point was: here were two British bands who mattered, at least in Britain. </p> <p>This was 14 August 1995 and, as Stuart Maconie noted in Q last year, it marked the beginning of a golden year when Britain became Cool Britannia (the New Labour rebranding came later, abruptly killing whatever cool was left) - which took in Oasis's multi-million-selling (What's the Story) Morning Glory? and their epochal concerts at Loch Lomond and Knebworth, the A-list celebrity coupledom of Damon Albarn/Justine Frischmann and Liam Gallagher/Patsy Kensit, a swarm of new platinum-selling British groups (Pulp, Supergrass, Elastica, the Boo Radleys), the corporate rise of dance music (Ministry of Sound, Cream, plus 'bands' such as the Chemical Brothers), and interrelated British success stories in fashion, football and art. </p> <p>According to Maconie, it all ended - this glorious illusion that the nation could once again reach the 'swinging' peaks of 1966 - with sunken English hearts and a riot in Trafalgar Square, on 26 June 1996, when Gareth Southgate missed that penalty against Germany in the semi-final of Euro 96. From then on, Britpop was tarnished and the chirpier groups slid down the charts, to be succeeded by a darker-hued generation: The Verve, The Prodigy, Manic Street Preachers, and above all Radiohead, whose emotionally wracked 1995 album The Bends finally reached the top of the charts a year after its release. </p> <p>An alternative date for the end of the glory period would be 21 August 1997, when Oasis finally released Be Here Now and it became horribly, blindingly obvious that the years of champagne and cocaine had destroyed the songwriting part of Noel Gallagher's brain. This was after the brief euphoria of New Labour's landslide victory ('Goodbye, xenophobia,' proclaimed the front page of The Observer, optimistically) and what seemed, to non-cynics, like a national emotional breakthrough with Princess Diana's death. Suddenly Britain was a 'young country', unafraid to express its feelings, happy to smile at strangers on the Tube, sensitive, self-aware and halfway to republicanism. </p> <p>In this climate, the music of Radiohead and The Verve made perfect sense. The Verve were the more optimistic of the two, Richard Ashcroft insisting on 'Bitter Sweet Symphony' that 'I can change, I can change, I can change...'. Radiohead's OK Computer presented a more claustrophobic, paranoid view of these pre-millennial years, but even here there was a kind of optimism. On 'Lucky' and 'Airbag', Thom Yorke sang of miraculously surviving car and plane crashes. Though the storm clouds were gathering ominously, there were still brilliant shafts of light. </p> <p>By 1999, the musical barometer had changed again. The threat of a storm had cleared - people had stopped worrying about the millennium bug; only a few nutters feared the end of the world - but mass disillusion had set in. The Dome stood, a massive void bereft of ideas, as a symbol of the Government's hubris and inertia. Diana's legacy had become a squalid squabble over commercial rights and positive PR. Inflation and unemployment were low, but so was our sense of expectation. The monarchy was solid, commuters looked away glassily on the Tube and the British rock scene was moribund. People talked once again of the genre having passed its sell-by date. Britpop and Madchester seemed aeons away. </p> <p>Most of the British bands who have mattered in the past 10 years have either disbanded (Happy Mondays, Stone Roses, The Verve,) or have turned into a self-parody (Oasis, Suede) or an irrelevance (Primal Scream, Blur, Pulp). The others - Radiohead and The Prodigy - appear to have given up trying to be commercially successful. Into this void have slipped the determinedly modest Travis and Stereophonics and their successors, Coldplay. Imageless, inarticulate, sensitive and serious, these are groups who 'let the music do the talking'. </p> <p>But what is it saying? It may sound like an inoffensive, conventional mush of tuneful guitar pop, but if you listen closely you can hear its subliminal message: don't get your hopes up. These are just songs, we are just bands, it's pointless to expect more. We live on a sad little island, the drugs don't work, the news is always grim, the government will always be Tory, our sportspeople will always be losers. And it's raining.</p>",

People talked once again of the genre having passed its sell-by date. Britpop and Madchester seemed aeons away. Most of the British bands who have mattered in the past 10 years have either disbanded (Happy Mondays, Stone Roses, The Verve,) or have turned into a self-parody (Oasis, Suede) or an irrelevance (Primal Scream, Blur, Pulp). The others - Radiohead and The Prodigy - appear to have given up trying to be commercially successful. Into this void have slipped the determinedly modest Travis and Stereophonics and their successors, Coldplay. Imageless, inarticulate, sensitive and serious, these are groups who 'let the music do the talking'. But what is it saying? It may sound like an inoffensive, conventional mush of tuneful guitar pop, but if you listen closely you can hear its subliminal message: don't get your hopes up. These are just songs, we are just bands, it's pointless to expect more. We live on a sad little island, the drugs don't work, the news is always grim, the government will always be Tory, our sportspeople will always be losers. And it's raining.",

I'm going to make a short film. I decide to take all my holiday and attend an eight-week filmmaking course in New York starting in August. </p> <p> <strong> 2 January</strong> </p> <p> My girlfriend, Emma, announces, unexpectedly, that she is pregnant. Our baby is due 19 August. </p> <p> <strong> 4 March</strong> </p> <p> Emma and I reach a compromise. I sign up for a weekend directing course in London. I also get a vague idea for a short film about a gangster's moll. On the course, I meet Sarah McGuinness, a former musician and theatre director who now wants to move into acting. I see her perform and decide she would be perfect for the part. I sit down to write but nothing comes. I give up on the moll and write a script based on a real-life road-rage incident. </p> <p> <strong> 18 April</strong> </p> <p> I finish Rage! Sarah loves it but points out that the only parts are for Rastafarians. She asks about the moll piece. I tell her it's going well, then stare at a blank screen for a few hours. </p> <p> <strong> 27 April</strong> </p> <p> I awake to find Sarah has left two messages on my voice mail and two more on my mobile phone. She sounds panicky. I call her back. </p> <p>'Tony, hi. You know that piece you're writing.' </p> <p>I bite my tongue. 'Yeah.' </p> <p>'Well, rather than 10 minutes, do you think you could make it a monologue and stretch it to 50 minutes? If you could, we could take it to Edinburgh. The Gilded Balloon has one slot left. I need to know soon.' </p> <p>'How soon?' </p> <p>'Well, actually, I needed to know yesterday. In fact, I've already said yes. We have until this afternoon to come up with a title and a blurb for the Festival programme.' </p> <p>After three hours of word association we come up with Whacked! , partly in tribute to my hero Neil Labute, whose play Bash! I had seen a few weeks earlier. Our tag- line is: 'A play about the thin line between loving someone and wanting to smash their face in with a baseball bat.' I still have no idea what it will actually be about. </p> <p> <strong> 10 May</strong> </p> <p> I go through old interviews with gangsters and their girlfriends. What appeals is the way their lifestyle mixes glamour and the mundane. I jot down a few ideas - cleaning cocaine off the kitchen table in order to serve dinner, being annoyed about someone being stabbed in your living-room because you can't get the bloodstain out of the carpet. </p> <p> <strong> 16 May</strong> </p> <p> Sarah starts calling in favours and working hard to get people excited about the project. She calls to tell me that Gari Jones might be willing to direct. He is a long-time collaborator of Harold Pinter's - he directed him in The Caretaker . He's only 29! Sarah explains that she has sent him the Rage! script and asks how Whacked! is coming. I change the subject. </p> <p> <strong> 18 May</strong> </p> <p> Gari calls me. He loves Rage! He can't wait to read Whacked! Neither can I. </p> <p> <strong> 27 May</strong> </p> <p> I don't know if it's any good. I send a few pages to some friends. The response is pos itive. I press on. </p> <p> <strong> 2 June</strong> </p> <p> I feel I'm halfway there. I read it through and reach the end in 15 minutes. I start to panic. </p> <p> <strong> 4 June</strong> </p> <p> Sarah calls to gently remind me that she needs at least six weeks to rehearse. And the script. I spend all day on it and write one new paragraph. </p> <p> <strong> 7 June</strong> </p> <p> I come up with a sick twist. A really sick twist. I worry that it might be over the top. Then I meet Gari for the first time. He looks like a chain-smoking extra from Interview With a Vampire. He loves the twist. He starts asking detailed questions about the background of the character, Annie. It's an inspiration. I finish that same night. </p> <p> <strong> 8 June</strong> </p> <p> There's a section in Whacked! where Annie describes in great detail a man being beaten to a pulp by her boyfriend. She does this in a matter-of-fact way as if she is talking about baking a cake. I wanted her doing something mundane, so I had her going behind a screen and changing her clothes. Gari moves the scene to another part of the play where it has greater significance. He also points out that, as the character is alone, the screen is unneces sary. Sarah shrieks: 'You bastards' then joins a gym and goes on a sushi and mineral-water diet. </p> <p> <strong> 10 June</strong> </p> <p> Sarah calls to tell me that Sandy Powell, one of the world's most sought-after costume designers, has agreed to work on Whacked! She won the Oscar for Shakespeare in Love and also worked on Velvet Goldmine and Orlando . Good thing I didn't go to New York. </p> <p> <strong> 18 June</strong> </p> <p> Sandy comes up with Annie's look. 'She's a bit like Victoria Beckham. Tacky but expensive.' Two days after delivering a brilliant costume, Sandy leaves to work on the new Scorsese film. </p> <p> <strong> 4 July</strong> </p> <p> Rehearsals start. Gari takes Sarah through the text line by line. 'I want to make sure we have the right voice. I want Annie to be a real person.' Hearing the lines read out for the first time leads to a few rewrites and changes. </p> <p> <strong> 26 July</strong> </p> <p> Disaster.

      "body": "<p>I've been seeing my girlfriend for four months and at the beginning of the relationship I was happy and madly in love with her. However, things have progressed and as she has become obviously attached to me, my feelings for her have diminished. Although I still fancy her, I know that we do not have enough shared interest between us. Is it just the usual question of cold feet or should I trust my instincts and get out before it develops into something which could hurt both of us?<br> <b> E.M. of London</b></p> <p>Your letter provokes speculation about the nature of sexual attraction, an enduring mystery which hopefully will never be reduced to a formula.</p> <p>However, there seem to be two distinct components, like so many aspects of human behaviour; one primitive and physical, the other more cerebral and rational.</p> <p>For a really good, enduring partnership the two have to be right. There is some scientific evidence, however, that within certain cultural constraints, attraction is remarkably random. This suggests that the primitive magnetism gets to work first, assisted by the hormones and probably physical gratification.</p> <p>Then the process of imprinting - mutual exploration - tightens the bonds and the pairing off may be a fait accompli long before the spoilsport intellect manages to have a say in the matter.</p> <p>Our superior brain power as well as modern mobility, which facilitates a larger field for exploration, should in theory enable us to pair off more rationally. I'm not sure, however, that theory is born out in practice.</p> <p>Anthropologists believe that the male of the species is geared to seek for sex widely, working the field indiscriminately, motivated to spread his sperm around as profusely as possible.</p> <p>Women, on the other hand, tend to be more selective, behaving as if looking for extra-special genes to pass on to future progeny.</p> <p>Men seek quantity, women look for quality. Your letter encapsulates this difference neatly.</p> <p>You seem to have a strong sexual attraction to the current infatuation but not much else. She, however, seems to be ready to commit to you.</p> <p>Many men relish the excitement of the challenge, the chase, the mesmerising and the courtship - all the early stages of pair-bonding - so much that having conquered, they lose interest and want to repeat the whole exhilarating process with someone new.</p> <p>This is the male equivalent of gypsy Carmen and like her you are put off in proportion to your friend's growing attachment.</p> <p>Presumably the butterfly life-cycle habitually lasts about four months, and if this is the usual duration of your passion, it would be better to stop fooling yourself and the lady of the moment into thinking that this is anything other than a young man's lighthearted fancy.</p> <p>You are just not ready for a long-lasting relationship. Cold feet are a euphemistic irrelevance.</p> <p>Rather, your hot hormones and compliant gonads are leading you by the nose.</p> <p>When you begin to engage your brain at the start instead of the close of a relationship, you might find your soul mate and put an end to the trail of broken hearts.</p> <p><b>Readers' replies</b></p> <p>You don't say in your letter how old you are. If you are still a young man in your twenties or early thirties then loyalty and commitment will come with maturity.</p> <p>If, however, you are in your late thirties or forties then I would not hold out much hope of you maturing to the stage that you could hold down a steady relationship. You are obviously self-centred, unreliable and not worth bothering about.

      "bodyText": "I've been seeing my girlfriend for four months and at the beginning of the relationship I was happy and madly in love with her. However, things have progressed and as she has become obviously attached to me, my feelings for her have diminished. Although I still fancy her, I know that we do not have enough shared interest between us. Is it just the usual question of cold feet or should I trust my instincts and get out before it develops into something which could hurt both of us? E.M. of London Your letter provokes speculation about the nature of sexual attraction, an enduring mystery which hopefully will never be reduced to a formula. However, there seem to be two distinct components, like so many aspects of human behaviour; one primitive and physical, the other more cerebral and rational. For a really good, enduring partnership the two have to be right. There is some scientific evidence, however, that within certain cultural constraints, attraction is remarkably random. This suggests that the primitive magnetism gets to work first, assisted by the hormones and probably physical gratification. Then the process of imprinting - mutual exploration - tightens the bonds and the pairing off may be a fait accompli long before the spoilsport intellect manages to have a say in the matter. Our superior brain power as well as modern mobility, which facilitates a larger field for exploration, should in theory enable us to pair off more rationally. I'm not sure, however, that theory is born out in practice. Anthropologists believe that the male of the species is geared to seek for sex widely, working the field indiscriminately, motivated to spread his sperm around as profusely as possible. Women, on the other hand, tend to be more selective, behaving as if looking for extra-special genes to pass on to future progeny. Men seek quantity, women look for quality. Your letter encapsulates this difference neatly. You seem to have a strong sexual attraction to the current infatuation but not much else. She, however, seems to be ready to commit to you. Many men relish the excitement of the challenge, the chase, the mesmerising and the courtship - all the early stages of pair-bonding - so much that having conquered, they lose interest and want to repeat the whole exhilarating process with someone new. This is the male equivalent of gypsy Carmen and like her you are put off in proportion to your friend's growing attachment. Presumably the butterfly life-cycle habitually lasts about four months, and if this is the usual duration of your passion, it would be better to stop fooling yourself and the lady of the moment into thinking that this is anything other than a young man's lighthearted fancy. You are just not ready for a long-lasting relationship. Cold feet are a euphemistic irrelevance. Rather, your hot hormones and compliant gonads are leading you by the nose. When you begin to engage your brain at the start instead of the close of a relationship, you might find your soul mate and put an end to the trail of broken hearts. Readers' replies You don't say in your letter how old you are. If you are still a young man in your twenties or early thirties then loyalty and commitment will come with maturity. If, however, you are in your late thirties or forties then I would not hold out much hope of you maturing to the stage that you could hold down a steady relationship. You are obviously self-centred, unreliable and not worth bothering about. My advice would be to prepare yourself for a very lonely, bitter old age - it's not that far away. K.T. of Wandsworth, London Next week's dilemma My 16-year-old son has been going out for some months with his first serious girlfriend. She is the same age.

      "body": "<p>Jackie Arnold is one of Britain's new generation of the child-free. 'I used to see too many women where I was working who, if they were married, would be worried about taking jobs on. I just didn't want that.' </p> <p>Arnold is having none of this. She has taken a radical path. At the age of just 21, she has been sterilised: 'It's the easiest decision I've ever had to make about anything.' </p> <p>This young London magazine writer is one of tens of thousands of Britons who have become child-free activists in the last year. They are all men and women who want to remain childless and feel cheapened by a society which still puts a relentless cultural and even political premium on reproduction. To be child-free in this context means giving more thought to not having children than most parents give to having them. </p> <p>Britain's childless adults have been inspired by a recent surge of fury at 'family fascism' in America. What has crystallised their personal angst into political anger is the more progressive approach to employees with families which many regard as one of the few enlightened aspects of early twenty-first-century capitalism. </p> <p>But they also protest at ostracism and endless hours of office chatter about other people's babies. And they hate the way that parents - often older and more affluent than they used to be - are allowing children to overrun hotels, restaurants and holiday resorts which were once child-free zones. </p> <p>Concern about covering for colleagues who have children turns out to be widespread in Britain. A poll carried out this week among 2,000 managers for Management Today found that 55 per cent said that childless staff can resent family-friendly policies in the workplace. </p> <p>Ed Adams who lives in Gloucester is typical: 'If I took the afternoon off because the dog had a cold,' he says, 'my colleagues wouldn't accept it for one moment. But if I had a child, they'd be falling over themselves to let me go home. Why should parents get more breaks and time off?' </p> <p>The 36-year-old accountant, accustomed to being regarded as eccentric for his decision not to have children, is now finding that his voice resonates with legions of others. </p> <p>'When we needed to breed the things to go off and fight the Germans,' said Adams, 'that was one thing. We don't need them now. Who could think that children would make you complete as a couple? Children are much more likely to break a couple up. Imagine a woman's sex life if she's been up all night two nights running and she's been breast-feeding. </p> <p>'Flexible holidays, time off for school plays, paternity leave. I don't resent them having it,' says Adams. 'But what am I getting? I do the same day's work.' </p> <p>In America, those without children have been campaigning for a decade for fairer treatment at work. They started by commandeering a vocabulary - 'child-free' and 'unburdened' - that does not carry the barren stigma of the word childless. </p> <p>The movement has flourished on the internet where, and we are talking America, they are 'sharing their pain' at the social exclusion they felt. The cyber encounters led to the establishment of No Kidding!, an organisation that now has chapters in 47 North American cities. On this and other sites such as Brats!, the words used for kids include 'anklebiters', 'crib lizards' and 'sprogs'. </p> <p>The founder of No Kidding!, Jerry Steinberg says: 'Conversations with my child-burdened friends became monologues. I'd say \"How's it going?\" and they'd bombard me with information about their kids.' Admirers of Steinberg have just started the first UK No Kidding! chapter in Birmingham. </p> <p>Supporters of the child-free movement are dubbed 'Thinkers' - two healthy incomes, no kids, early retirement. Better a thinker, they say, than a 'Sitcom' - single income, two children, oppressive mortgage. </p> <p>What prompted the transformation of the American child-free movement into a political thorn was the publication last year of a book which now serves as a child-free bible. Elinor Burkett's Baby Boon: How Family-Friendly America Cheats the Childless has made the author a Betty Friedan of the childless. Burkett and her supporters are determined to debunk the political mystique surrounding the family: 'This is about a political and economic structure which relegates the childless to second-class citizens. Parents are getting more than non-parents.' </p> <p>In the meantime, however, American parents have been deluged with even more tax breaks by a 'family-friendly' Bill Clinton. Last year, the US tax credit for every child was increased to $900. 'And who subsidises that tax break?' asks Burkett. 'You're looking at her. In this wonderful world where welfare has allegedly been transformed, the poor lose federal benefits if they don't work, but the doctors and lawyers who don't work after they have kids can receive cheques from Uncle Sam.' </p> <p>What American child-free campaigners are now demanding from their political representatives is for a range of benefit options to be offered to employees. People should have a cash value of perks they can take from the employer. Some could take healthcare for children, others might prefer sabbatical time instead. </p> <p>And employers should stop abusing the childless too. 'Every time someone takes time off for that sick child, someone else has to do the work,' complains Burkett. 'Management always supposes that the person without kids is more able - and it's true - to do that than a parent. But it happens again and again. After a while, you're doing two jobs for one salary.' </p> <p>For the American campaigners, being 'unburdened' is not just about resentment of other people's tax perks. 'It's beyond my comprehension how any intelligent, thinking person could ever wish to produce or raise children,' says 33-year-old Steve Fricke, a computer operator in Illinois. </p> <p>'I simply don't like being around kids. They're obnoxious, annoying, messy, little people who only behave appropriately when asleep. In addition to that, I consider time and money to be two of the most valuable things a person can have. Children cost a lot of both, and very often yield no appreciable reward. </p> <p>'Not that most pregnancies occur as the result of a thoughtful, carefully planned consideration of whether breeding would be wise. I consider life to be grievously burdensome, often painful and not generally a thing to be desired. Not that I'm unhappy. But only the most ignorant and base consider life to be a good and pleasant thing. </p> <p>'My views have made it difficult for me in some ways,' admits Fricke. 'I insist upon two qualities in a potential mate. She must be a born-again Christian, and she must be willing to never have or raise children.' Fricke has not yet found a long-term girlfriend. </p> <p>Fricke and the American adult childless now make up more than 10 per cent of the US electorate. It is inconceivable that they will not be recognised as a discrete political entity before long. </p> <p>In Britain the child-free movement is gaining ground, so that Jackie Arnold and her contemporaries find themselves representative of the age. In 1998, 26 per cent of people were married or co-habiting and had no children. A generation earlier, in 1979, the figure was just 20 per cent. Nearly 25 per cent of women born in Britain in 1973 will be childless at 45. Just 10 per cent of those born 30 years earlier would reach middle age without bearing children. </p> <p>Arnold is sensitive to one of the biggest worries of the child-free, whether straight or gay. ' I've told my parents they're not going to be grandparents. But they don't know I was sterilised. Until now, I was worried that they'd regret my decision.' </p> <p>Almost all child-free activists are heterosexual. While lesbians and gays have been characterised - or stigmatised - for decades as anti-child, they are now revealing to the world for the first time a truth about their child-rearing, that for some of them it has been going on for decades. But as Barry and Tony Drewitt-Barlow announce to the tabloid press that they are proud gay dads, it is their straight counterparts - the ones who have faced, or endured, the automatic expectation of reproductive activity - who are saying enough is enough. </p> <p>For those who do still want to be parents, effective contraception and changed career patterns have meant that parents are having children at an older age when they are often more affluent. With more cash has come the ability to take them to restaurants or hotels where once they would have been priced out of the market. </p> <p>But that can mean frustration for the child-free. 'We went to Malta last year,' says Adams. 'We made the mistake of not checking and there were children everywhere in the resort. They are just irritating and self-centred. People might say, \"you were a child once\". But if I'd behaved the way that children do now, I'd have got a thick ear.' </p> <p>In response, more British businesses are starting to satisfy the commercial demands of the child-free, providing leisure facilities where children are not allowed. Sara Turnbull, proprietor of the Thornhill Hotel in Wimborne, Dorset, said: 'We just don't want children rushing up and down stairs disturbing other guests. </p> <p>'I might occasionally admit older girls, but there is always a danger of sticky hands and scribbles on the wall.

      "body": "<p>'Bella Freud for Jaeger': at first it looks improbable. Freud's clothes are nonchalant and saucy: they often make you laugh. Jaeger is sedateness itself. Yet look again, and Freud's announcement that she has signed a three-year contract with the firm is less surprising: both parties are committed to tailoring and good quality, to tweeds and to knitwear. Freud thinks it's 'a real soul-match'. </p> <p>The contract, part of a general revamping of the Jaeger brand, requires the 39-year-old to produce two collections of about 75 pieces a year. They'll feature the slinky tailored suits and jackets which have made her famous; she is also hoping to develop other areas, such as accessories. She has already started to pore over the Jaeger archives, looking for points that can be elegantly modernised, seeking to recapture the glamorous advertisements she remembers from her childhood. Sellotaped to the mirror of her Kensal Road home are some 50 ink drawings of scarves and jackets and knickers; one instruction reads: 'Mac with bonkers lining'. There are swatches of blue tweed lying around, and a tiny torso on the table clad in tight lace. She aims to bring 'high-spiritedness' to Jaeger. </p> <p>High spirits touch every detail of Freud's enterprise. She herself is grave, dignified and reflective - which is to say, totally humorous. Her logo - which she will keep for her non-Jaeger work - was drawn by her father Lucian Freud. It shows a lean-faced dog with its tongue sticking out: it is grinning; it is sleek but wolfish. The names she gives to her clothes are almost a novel in themselves, reminding you that she comes from a family - Esther Freud, Rose Boyt, Susie Boyt - who write as well as paint. She has designed a New York Doll dress in dappled green tiger chiffon and a hooded Black Madonna dress in purple leopard-print jersey. There's a Paris le Trash Mac in policeman blue. </p> <p>And there's the garment named after the infant toff whose portrait Freud spotted in a history book. He was wearing a seriously tailored jacket, with a double row of buttons. Freud adapted the item, keeping all the buttons, but taking away the formality, to make a feminine version in which a girl could feel like Elizabeth Taylor. She called it the Baby Earl jacket. </p> <p>She looks for ideas 'every second of the day', and finds them all over the place: 'galleries, landscapes, architecture, rubbish, old ladies'. The clothes these inspire are worn by Tilda Swinton and Lucy Ferry, Courtney Love and Kylie Minogue, Kate Moss, Jerry Hall, Gillian Anderson and Marianne Faithfull. Jools Holland and Nick Cave get into her jumpers. Geri Halliwell and Eddie Izzard have been seen - separately - wearing the same Bella Freud coat. Her publicist sports a Freud T-shirt with a huge tattoo-style heart inscribed with the word Daddy and pierced by an arrow. One arm reads 'Bella'; the other has a semi-naked lady on it. The two wrists read 'Justa love... hate thing'. </p> <p>Suits - with trousers or skirts - are the basis of her collections. Ever since her twenties, when she studied fashion in Rome, she's been fascinated by Coco Chanel, and the idea of an ensemble: 'There's nothing like a suit to catch someone's eye and follow the shape of the body.' But 'now that everyone looks younger', her suits have a different emphasis: they're no longer to do with going to the office but with showing off the body. Inside the shell of the suit, her knitwear - bobbled or smooth, deceptively meek or ingeniously patterned - also has to be 'alive': when the jacket's off, the interior mustn't 'go to sleep'. </p> <p>'Playful' is a word Freud uses a lot. She thinks it's a good sign when people are amused by her clothes: 'Beautiful things often do make people laugh. People forget that.' Ten years ago, when pastels were associated with prams and romper suits, she decked out her models in pink and powder-blue tailored suits. And she always uses fabric provocatively. She'll take a piece of tweed and try to tease out aspects that are normally hidden, aiming to 'change its atmosphere'. Colours that usually dissolve into a 'heathery blur' can be made to 'bash against each other' by introducing a stripe. Instead of being used for bulky leather-patched jackets, her tweeds become weeny skirts. </p> <p>She's also re-thought the way clothes can be presented to the public. For her second collection in 1991, she took her models to Newbury racetrack and filmed them - with music from Bryan Ferry, Fats Waller and Hendrix - watching the races and having lunch. The clothes - suits in pale blue, 'whippet' and oyster - looked wonderful, although the girls were surrounded by startlingly unpleasant men muttering about tarts. In 1997 she showed her collection - orange zebra patterns and lilac safari suits - at the Fridge in Brixton and called it 'The Best Dressed Chicken in Town'. Round Liquorice Allsorts handbags were dangled while 'My Boy Lollipop' played. On the catwalk, along with Kate Moss, were Sophie Dahl and, in gunmetal grey, the artist Sarah Lucas. Her autumn 2000 collection was presented in the form of a magazine: pictures for it were shot in Anita Pallenberg's London flat. It was Pallenberg, as the Sixties' bad girl in Barbarella and Performance , who had inspired the clothes. </p> <p>And there are Freud's videos. A year ago, deciding that catwalk shows meant a lot of effort for little reward, she returned to the idea of filming her collections, loving the idea that they could be switched on anywhere. A friend suggested John Malkovich might be interested in directing, and Freud, having met him briefly, thought he might be 'eccentric enough to go for it: that his taste might be perverse enough'. She tracked him down in Paris where he was filming; she showed him some fabric; they talked for half an hour, and he agreed. The result was Strap Hanging , which shows a model-crammed tube train, with the women languorous, dynamic and overwhelming, and a man trapped by them and his inflatable underpants. They filmed for a day and a half; they edited non-stop for 24 hours; they showed it in New York the next day. Its success led to another Malkovich project, Lady Behave , featuring a slatternly girl and an etiquette school run by the dominating Arielle Dombasle and starring Jodie Kidd, Susie Bick and Lizzie Jagger. </p> <p>Film suits Freud's liking for 'undercurrents, double-entendres, mixed messages'. The catwalk demands an expansive theatricality: 'You need to be really, really blatant. On film you can be more circumspect.' The meeting of Freud and Jaeger is another mixed message. The first 'Bella Freud for Jaeger' collection will be seen in winter 2001. It looks as if they'll be well-suited.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Caroline Coon is a morning person. When I arrive to interview her at midday, the artist, activist, and 'High Priestess of the Sixties Counterculture' has already been up for seven hours. In the Sixties, Coon would get up early to run Release, the help centre for people in trouble with the police over drugs, which she famously set up with Rufus Jones in 1967. </p> <p>These days, Coon uses the early hours to paint, read or make agitprop fly-posters ('Purdah Murder'; 'Poverty Kills'). Until very recently, Coon also had to find time to immerse herself in law books, in order to be able to represent herself in her two-year legal battle with Random House, the company responsible for publishing Jonathon Green's 1998 book, All Dressed Up: the Sixties and the Counter-Culture . </p> <p>In Green's book, a passage related how 'a young woman from Release' would give oral sex to rock stars in return for large donations. The book goes on to describe how George Harrison complied, while Mick Jagger accepted the sex, but sneered afterwards: 'If she thinks I'm going to give her a grand for a blow job, she's crazy.' It was all untrue. </p> <p>Financially speaking, Coon was in no position to sue, but she did anyway. In June this year, she was awarded \u00a373,000 in costs and damages (some of which she donated towards setting up an official Release archive), and All Dressed Up was withdrawn from sale. </p> <p>'Defending myself was terrifying,' says Coon, as we sit in her pristine, bohemian west London living-room, surrounded by her colourful, sensual paintings. 'Technically, I hadn't done anything like it before so it felt like trying to drive a Ferrari down a coal mine.' </p> <p>Coon reveals that one of the reasons she decided to take on Random House was the 'deeply misogynistic' reaction to her protest at the false allegations. 'I was told that although it was an untrue story, it was an amusing untrue story. I was lectured that if I hadn't prostituted myself for Release, then maybe I should have done, because it would have been a heroic act.' She smiles wryly. 'This was the reaction I was getting from what I could call unreconstructed Sixties Man.' </p> <p>In Coon's opinion, it was a much more serious matter. 'To me, it amounted to verbal rape,' she says, calmly but emphatically, in her husky, genteel tones. 'It wasn't just this \"funny\" thing about a woman giving blow jobs to rock stars - it was one big pornographic humiliation fantasy. And there were racist elements to it, too. The paragraph before said something like, \"Caroline Coon was upper class, but she slept with black boys which increased her exotic appeal\".' Coon looks at me incredulously, and then lets out a short whoop of anguished laughter: 'And this is supposed to be 2000!' </p> <p>Coon has had a lifetime of being misunderstood. Her provocative art has taken in a range of subjects including flowers, mythology, war and murder. However, she is mainly known for her work dealing in the diverse beauty of the human nude, in particular her studies of naked black men who also happened to be her friends and lovers. This has led to to Coon being referred to dismissively as 'the artist who likes to paint black men' or, even more bluntly, 'that woman who likes penises'. </p> <p>Coon has long professed to be incensed by the double standards: 'Why is the penis hidden in culture? How many female nudes are there?' She was similarly amazed by the uproar in 1995, when the Liverpool Tate decided not use her painting, Mr Olympia, directly inspired by Manet's female nude, Olympia, because the black model had a semi-erection. </p> <p>'I paint my life,' says Coon simply. 'My friends have always been multicultural.' Later, she says: 'What's wrong with painting penises? Journalists always come round and say [she adopts a sombre tone], \"Caroline Coon is an artist who likes penises\". But the idea that women will make love to men and not like the penis is to me psychopathic, pathological. We draw the penis into us; you have to love it. If you don't, then what is happening here?' </p> <p>Coon herself is bisexual, though she prefers to keep that as quiet as possible for fear of titillating the general public. 'I try to be as private about my private life as I can be,' she says. 'But I still think it's very important to keep on discussing the theory of sexual liberation. My position is that I am not perverse at all. They are perverse. They are the bigots. They are the hypocrites. They are the ones in denial of their sexuality.' </p> <p>Coon is sitting on the floor of her living-room, wearing dazzling white leggings and a matching top.

      "bodyText": "Caroline Coon is a morning person. When I arrive to interview her at midday, the artist, activist, and 'High Priestess of the Sixties Counterculture' has already been up for seven hours. In the Sixties, Coon would get up early to run Release, the help centre for people in trouble with the police over drugs, which she famously set up with Rufus Jones in 1967. These days, Coon uses the early hours to paint, read or make agitprop fly-posters ('Purdah Murder'; 'Poverty Kills'). Until very recently, Coon also had to find time to immerse herself in law books, in order to be able to represent herself in her two-year legal battle with Random House, the company responsible for publishing Jonathon Green's 1998 book, All Dressed Up: the Sixties and the Counter-Culture . In Green's book, a passage related how 'a young woman from Release' would give oral sex to rock stars in return for large donations. The book goes on to describe how George Harrison complied, while Mick Jagger accepted the sex, but sneered afterwards: 'If she thinks I'm going to give her a grand for a blow job, she's crazy.' It was all untrue. Financially speaking, Coon was in no position to sue, but she did anyway. In June this year, she was awarded \u00a373,000 in costs and damages (some of which she donated towards setting up an official Release archive), and All Dressed Up was withdrawn from sale. 'Defending myself was terrifying,' says Coon, as we sit in her pristine, bohemian west London living-room, surrounded by her colourful, sensual paintings. 'Technically, I hadn't done anything like it before so it felt like trying to drive a Ferrari down a coal mine.' Coon reveals that one of the reasons she decided to take on Random House was the 'deeply misogynistic' reaction to her protest at the false allegations. 'I was told that although it was an untrue story, it was an amusing untrue story. I was lectured that if I hadn't prostituted myself for Release, then maybe I should have done, because it would have been a heroic act.' She smiles wryly. 'This was the reaction I was getting from what I could call unreconstructed Sixties Man.' In Coon's opinion, it was a much more serious matter. 'To me, it amounted to verbal rape,' she says, calmly but emphatically, in her husky, genteel tones. 'It wasn't just this \"funny\" thing about a woman giving blow jobs to rock stars - it was one big pornographic humiliation fantasy. And there were racist elements to it, too. The paragraph before said something like, \"Caroline Coon was upper class, but she slept with black boys which increased her exotic appeal\".' Coon looks at me incredulously, and then lets out a short whoop of anguished laughter: 'And this is supposed to be 2000!' Coon has had a lifetime of being misunderstood. Her provocative art has taken in a range of subjects including flowers, mythology, war and murder. However, she is mainly known for her work dealing in the diverse beauty of the human nude, in particular her studies of naked black men who also happened to be her friends and lovers. This has led to to Coon being referred to dismissively as 'the artist who likes to paint black men' or, even more bluntly, 'that woman who likes penises'. Coon has long professed to be incensed by the double standards: 'Why is the penis hidden in culture? How many female nudes are there?' She was similarly amazed by the uproar in 1995, when the Liverpool Tate decided not use her painting, Mr Olympia, directly inspired by Manet's female nude, Olympia, because the black model had a semi-erection. 'I paint my life,' says Coon simply. 'My friends have always been multicultural.' Later, she says: 'What's wrong with painting penises? Journalists always come round and say [she adopts a sombre tone], \"Caroline Coon is an artist who likes penises\". But the idea that women will make love to men and not like the penis is to me psychopathic, pathological. We draw the penis into us; you have to love it. If you don't, then what is happening here?' Coon herself is bisexual, though she prefers to keep that as quiet as possible for fear of titillating the general public. 'I try to be as private about my private life as I can be,' she says. 'But I still think it's very important to keep on discussing the theory of sexual liberation. My position is that I am not perverse at all. They are perverse. They are the bigots. They are the hypocrites. They are the ones in denial of their sexuality.' Coon is sitting on the floor of her living-room, wearing dazzling white leggings and a matching top. The sun is streaming through the window and bouncing off her sleek hair, a mop of avant- garde, black-and-white stripes. At 55, her body is as taut, trim, and 'yoga-fit' as a woman half her age. While Coon has the courage of her sociopolitical convictions ('I consider myself part of a leftist project that wants change'), she acknowledges that her own situation is far from hellish. 'The world I live in, the heaven of Ladbroke Grove, means that any moan I might have about inequality is as nothing compared to what other people have to live through,' she says. Indeed, Coon cheerfully reveals that, in a rare bit of money luck, her heavenly west London home cost her only \u00a315,000 because her Fenella Fielding accent got her on to some spurious, upper-income council list. 'Now that's what I call an interesting story about class,' she drawls mischievously. Croline Coon was born in 1945 to a family of wealthy, ecologically conscious Kent landowners. It was an environment, Coon says, where women were regarded as little more than 'marriage-meat'. Influenced by this, she spent her youth loudly rejecting marriage, domesticity and motherhood, claiming, where the latter was concerned, that she 'wanted to be free to commit suicide'. This decision starts looking even more complicated when you learn that Coon was sent away to board at the prestigious Legat Russian Ballet School at the age of five, mainly because her father abused her. 'I've had to say no to many men in life,' she says softly. 'And the first was my own father.' Although she had written passionately in the past on the subject of incest, Coon only went public about her own abuse very recently. However, reading past interviews, one is struck by how many times Coon hints at a terrible darkness in her background. It's as if, despite her best efforts, the secret she was keeping kept popping up into her mind like some sexually traumatic jack-in-the-box. These days, Coon believes that her father was abused himself, and that she may have been sent to boarding school for her own protection. Despite being severely dyslexic, she was happy at Legat, thriving in the disciplined, artistic, multicultural, 'gender-fluid' atmosphere. At 16, after a final row with her parents ('I wouldn't marry the next-door millionaire'), she decamped to London and her real life began in earnest. Along the way, Coon has dabbled in, among other things, modelling, movie-making, punditry and music journalism (during which she was the first to coin the term 'punk rock'). However, she is probably still best known for co-founding Release when she was still at art school. Release helped everybody from homeless runaways to rock stars. At one point, the organisation was handling one-third of all drug busts in Britain. Coon attracted a lot of individual attention for a variety of reasons - her feminist mettle (she is one of Germaine Greer's dedicatees for The Female Eunuch) ; her feral beauty (she was known in London circles as 'Caroline Swoon'); and last, but not least, her unapologetic poshness and love of high culture. She might have proudly marched alongside the newly politicised working classes in the Sixties, and been among the first to report on the likes of The Clash (whom she managed for a short period), but chez Coon, it was more about Anna Pavlova, Maria Callas and Stravinsky. Then as now, Coon's main political beef was with sexual inequality. 'The idea that women are still perceived as second-rate is shocking,' she says disgustedly. 'People say this is a postfeminist age, but misogyny is still such a hot current in our culture. We need feminists in the vanguard more than ever.'

      "body": "<p>Last Tuesday, Richard Seymour and Dick Powell, two of the UK's most influential and prolific product designers, gave the British public a really smart new idea: a central-locking system for the home. When you leave your house, you simply press the button on your key fob and every lock in the place clunks shut. It's one of those simple, sensible ideas, and you can't help but wonder why it hasn't been done before. Later this month, their magic bin will be unveiled as part of Better by Design, their six-part series for Channel 4. </p> <p>Richard and Dick are to design what the Two Fat Ladies were to cookery. They have become the most famous double act in product design. Instead of Clarissa and Jennifer's motorbike and sidecar, they travel around in Richard's silver Audi TT, speeding from their west London studio to various factories around Britain in search of a manufacturer with money to invest on a better version of a product already in production. Under their eagle-eyed scrutiny go the airline seat, the razor, the shopping trolley, the life jacket, the home security system and the kitchen bin. </p> <p>The bin is an unlikely subject for a gripping TV programme. But as they revel over the inadequacies of the standard swing-top bin - the lid gets splattered with baked beans as it flips, and pulling out the liner is about as arduous as giving birth - we are sucked into the Seymour-Powell world.</p> <p>These are the sorts of everyday problems they most enjoy solving. There are an infinite number of badly designed products cluttering our lives - there simply because we've got used to them and because there is no alternative. A swing bin is a swing bin. We fill it with rubbish. And that's that. But by the end of the bin programme, we won't be happy until we've swapped the swing top for a Seymour Powell Magic Door bin (the lid snaps open, leaving a void for the beans, and to change the bag, the bin simply opens at the front). </p> <p>The designers are all too aware of the consumer excitement such programmes generate. But it can take up to six years before a product reaches the shop floor. 'The intention of this series was to create potential solutions to problems we all have, not to push the things through into final manufacture,' explains Seymour. 'These were demonstration pieces to show how things could be better, and then the consumers want it now. The six products featured on the TV series are just prototypes, but they offer hope. Right now at the Seymour Powell studios, there are 30 other products all on their way into production. </p> <p>'We get very impatient with things being wrong and we want to do something about it,' says Seymour. 'The word design is not understood very well. Invention is part of design; engineering is part of design. We don't use the \"s\" word often [style], but the appearance of an object - how it interfaces visually and \"tactiley\" with you - is part of design. Its appearance is a part of the process.' Nevertheless, we now have several generations of consumer who buy a gadget simply because they like the way it looks. </p> <p>Take the toaster. Look in any kitchen store and you will see 10 or 12 of the things, from the rectangular \u00a320-something Kenwood to the state-of-the-art \u00a3140 Dualit. There's even a brushed-steel one made by Porsche. Despite the huge variety of sizes and finishes, they are all basically the same design - boxes with slots for the toast and a couple of knobs to make the bread go up and down. When Seymour Powell were asked by Tefal to make a better toaster, however, they came up with two simple but radical answers to two questions: a) Why are the controls on the side rather than on the front of the toaster where you want to use them? b) Why do you have to bend over it to see your toast cooking and risk singeing your eyebrows? </p> <p>'We put the controls on the front rather than on the side,' says Powell. 'And we tilted the toaster up so you can see your toast cooking.' Confronting issues often throws up more problems. 'The first prototypes threw the toast across the kitchen,' he admits. But eventually, they arrived at just the right angle. The Avanti toaster is priced from \u00a339.99 for the four-slice machine (\u00a349.99 if you want it in chrome). It arrived in the stores in June. </p> <p>The Seymour-Powell design philosophy begins with observing human behaviour, and the realisation - and acceptance - that we often use appliances the 'wrong' way. 'When we design something, we always start with how people are,' says Seymour. 'And how we are is very interesting because we're extremely adaptive, so we make up for inadequacies in the object. It's very arrogant to create a product that people have to learn how to use.' </p> <p>Their 'future kettle', like their toaster, is designed with human misuse in mind. A prototype designed with Tefal for an episode of Equinox about Dream Machines, it is still to be put into production. 'You should fill up an electric kettle with just enough water to make the quantity you want,' says Seymour. 'Most of us fill the thing up, which means you're boiling lots more water than you need to.' The solution? A thermal lining, as in a Thermos flask. 'You boil the water, and it is kept at a very high temperature. It is much more efficient in the way it uses energy, and takes into account the fact that the consumer is using the product \"wrongly\".' </p> <p>Seymour and Powell believe there is a move towards people buying appliances designed to last. 'Things are much more reliable than they were. That's very laudable.' They also want to see a return to the repair culture, whereby the appliance can be fixed rather than thrown away. </p> <p>Seymour Powell are masters of the domestic appliance, but they can turn their hands to anything. They've created a range of luxury luggage for Connolly, G-Shock and Baby-G watches for Casio, the interiors of the new-ish trains on London Underground's Northern Line, as well as motorbikes for Yamaha and - every boy's dream bike - the MZ Skorpion. 'We have been altering the landscape for quite a long time - on wrists, in homes, on floors, in kitchens, in living rooms,' says Seymour. </p> <p>Since they launched their company in 1984, they have been quietly changing the shape of people's lives. This autumn, their Bioform bra is launched for Charnos. It started life as a problem for last summer's Channel 4 design programme, Designs on Your... 'There was a groundswell of public opinion that said \"We want this\", and that was enough to push it forward,' says Powell.

Stuart's my bodyguard, my pal. He looks after me. We are totally honest with each other and he knows when I'm going overboard. We have a similar background but different lives.</p> <p>I came to Britain in 1979 aged 19. I'd had a difficult upbringing - I spent the first seven years of my life in an orphanage, and four years in a school run by the Red Cross in Italy. I was homeless and I worked in an Italian restaurant, washing up; then I began to construct my life. </p> <p>I've always been very expressive and I wanted to make something of my life, so I started doing pottery classes and this led on to a foundation course at Camberwell, and a degree in fine art at Chelsea. Now I have a studio near Brick Lane in east London where I make my sculptures. I'm now able to make the work I want to make, because people have had faith in me at the right moment.</p> <p>There is a cathartic element in my work, but I also want to make something beautiful. To me, the red cross is a symbol of protection - a feeling of belonging. My first red-cross tattoo was a political as well as a personal statement. </p> <p>I use my body as a site for representation, and do 'bleeding performances' on stage in front of an audience about four times a year. At a bleed, I also work with a doctor, who inserts a needle into the veins in my arms to let the blood flow freely. One of the doctors I have worked with was on the ethical committee of the BMA. </p> <p>I also give one-to-one performances [called Aktion 398] at galleries and museums around the world, where about 200 people come into the room to see me one by one. During performances I'm not aware of time. I'm naked and I paint myself white, and wear a white collar that you put on dogs so they don't lick their wounds: it is a metaphor for being vulnerable and powerful - if you use it in the right way. Stuart is like the nurse who comes to take your details and gets you from A to B. He also cuts me. </p> <p>I appear with the wound and people can touch it or just look.

People should be able to do what they want as long as they're not messing anyone else around. I think if he wants to express himself in the way he does, he's got every right. I'd seen Franko before, but we met properly in 1996 at the ICA when I went to see his show there. He wanted me to hoist him up at that one, but I had a bad back. </p> <p>I can see the emotion in Franko's performances, but to me it's just people reflecting on their own mortality. It only takes a few drops of someone else's blood for people to think, Shit, that could be mine. When people come into the gallery for Aktion 398, it reminds me of slowing down to see a motorway accident and catching a glimpse of the corpse; sometimes you look and see gallons of Claret and you think, Oh, maybe I shouldn't have looked. </p> <p>I'm a people watcher. When I'm not with Franko I drive a lorry, delivering beer to pubs and clubs, and I do freelance scarification. I also like messing about with collages and cutting things out - photos and text. I've done a lot of door work over the years, so I can sense someone who's potentially dangerous straightaway. We only have to look at each other and we both know. Some people have a thousand-yard stare and you know they're trouble. I rarely get flustered, but if something major went wrong, like one of his arteries collapsed, I'd have a few problems. I could get his heart started again and that's probably about it. </p> <p>I tell Franko how long he's got if he is doing a bleed: I have my eye on the clock. I'll quite happily cut him - it's not something you learn, you just get stuck in. I've also cut some text on his back. His hourly shock in the one-to-ones is when I come to re-do the cut - that brings him out of it a bit. I have to keep the wound fresh. </p> <p>I've been to Italy, Norway and Sweden with Franko, and we've also been to Mexico together. I was shocked at the amount of cops in the streets with guns there.

Another reason may be our growing affluence. As Charles George of The Fruit Garden (Groesfaen Road, Peterston Super Ely, Cardiff; 01446 760358) puts it wryly, 'We do get what we call the BMW brigade, who come into the farm shop in white shoes and say they haven't time to pick.'</p> <p>At least these ladies who love fruit realise the produce at The Fruit Garden is worth travelling for. Friends who came beetling back to the capital after a brief spell in the country say it is the one thing they miss about Cardiff. George supplies the catering trade all year round; the PYO is naturally a summer thing. There are blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, tayberries, jostaberries, red-, white- and blackcurrants. It's one of very few places where you can try 'Marais des Bois', a cross of commercial and wild strawberries which have the lovely perfumed flavour of alpines. Mrs George uses equal proportions of blackcurrants, redcurrants and tayberries to make her 'summer-fruits sorbet', sold with other ice creams made on the farm under the label Ices from the Fruit Garden. Customers picking their own fruit reward themselves with ice cream by the scoop, but it is also sold by the half-litre.</p> <p>At Woods Brasserie (Pilotage Building, Stuart Street, Cardiff Bay; 029 2049 2400), which is reckoned by aficionados to be the best restaurant in the area, slender, sophisticated customers are served The Fruit Garden's strawberries with black pepper and lemon juice. Greedier ones order them with Eton mess, a mixture of crushed meringue with Chantilly cream and a drizzle of pur\u00e9ed berries.</p> <p>Most of the exotic berries - tayberries, loganberries, sunberries, et al - are hybrids involving raspberries and blackberries and have their following among jam makers, because they tend to be sharp when firm, and instantly crushable when fully ripe, so difficult to present in a fruit salad.

      "bodyText": "Apparently, we're getting lazier as a nation. That's the sad surmise, anyway, which you might make on hearing that the pick-your-own trade has been declining for the past 10 years. Another reason may be our growing affluence. As Charles George of The Fruit Garden (Groesfaen Road, Peterston Super Ely, Cardiff; 01446 760358) puts it wryly, 'We do get what we call the BMW brigade, who come into the farm shop in white shoes and say they haven't time to pick.' At least these ladies who love fruit realise the produce at The Fruit Garden is worth travelling for. Friends who came beetling back to the capital after a brief spell in the country say it is the one thing they miss about Cardiff. George supplies the catering trade all year round; the PYO is naturally a summer thing. There are blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, tayberries, jostaberries, red-, white- and blackcurrants. It's one of very few places where you can try 'Marais des Bois', a cross of commercial and wild strawberries which have the lovely perfumed flavour of alpines. Mrs George uses equal proportions of blackcurrants, redcurrants and tayberries to make her 'summer-fruits sorbet', sold with other ice creams made on the farm under the label Ices from the Fruit Garden. Customers picking their own fruit reward themselves with ice cream by the scoop, but it is also sold by the half-litre. At Woods Brasserie (Pilotage Building, Stuart Street, Cardiff Bay; 029 2049 2400), which is reckoned by aficionados to be the best restaurant in the area, slender, sophisticated customers are served The Fruit Garden's strawberries with black pepper and lemon juice. Greedier ones order them with Eton mess, a mixture of crushed meringue with Chantilly cream and a drizzle of pur\u00e9ed berries. Most of the exotic berries - tayberries, loganberries, sunberries, et al - are hybrids involving raspberries and blackberries and have their following among jam makers, because they tend to be sharp when firm, and instantly crushable when fully ripe, so difficult to present in a fruit salad. Jostaberries are a cross between blackcurrants and gooseberries and purists think them odd. At Priory Farm (Sandy Lane, Nutfield, Redhill, Surrey; 01737 823304), farmer Nick Shinner notices that people picking their own 'buy lots of strawberries and raspberries, then just a few blueberries to sprinkle on top because they look nice'.

      "body": "<p>Put Santiago Calatrava in front of the astonishing new science museum that he has designed for his home town of Valencia, and you would never believe that he could be responsible for it. Calatrava in person is soft spoken, a diffident, diminutive figure. His work, on the other hand, has swagger, even grandiloquence in bucketloads. And in Valencia, at least, it is on a truly gigantic scale. </p> <p>Calatrava, guarded by his fiercely protective wife - an asset that is part of the essential armoury of many successful architects - is unworldy and monkish. But his work has become part of the raw material of power, an essential bargaining counter in the cut and thrust of ambitious politicians keen to make their mark. 'I don't go running after publicity,' Calatrava says. </p> <p>But he doesn't need to. His work is perfectly capable of speaking for itself. And he has the drive of a child prodigy with the talent to do anything. He trained as an architect and an engineer. He designs furniture and makes sculpture. </p> <p>When the BBC asked him to make a film about his favourite piece of architecture, it was no surprise to find that he chose to be filmed in the crypt of Antonio Gaudi's unfinished cathedral of Sagrada Familia in Barcelona, sketchbook in one hand and water colours in the other. Like Gaudi, Calatrava is fond of putting natural forms to work in his buildings. You can see bones and plant structures not very far from the surface. He, too, is a Catalan, and a one off. And as with Gaudi, people either regard his work as genius, or become uncomfortable with the monomania of its single mindedness. But it is clear that he identifies with Gaudi's otherworldiness as much as with his architecture. Gaudi lived like a monk, and is now being put forward as a candidate for sainthood. Calatrava is entirely uninterested in the material trappings of success, and shows a complete absence of guile. 'I just design to get things right,' he says. </p> <p>It is an unlikely formula for success, but in less than 10 years, it has driven Calatrava from relative obscurity as an engineer architect specialising in spectacular bridges, and given him the chance to design cathedrals, museums and airports. Calatrava's plans for rebuilding Valencia took pride of place at an extraordinary show of his work at the RIBA eight years ago, when he was still known as just a bridge builder. To find them, you had to run the gauntlet of a room full of surprisingly bland art - still a sideline of Calatrava's, along with his furniture. Then there was a sequence of architectural schemes for sites all over the world, each more flamboyant than the last. And then, just when you felt there was nothing else left for Calatrava to throw in, you spotted the small white skeleton of a dog positioned at the door, and next to it, the Valencia project. </p> <p>The dog was there to demonstrate the lessons enginers have to learn from natural structures. But it felt more like a memento mori, a skull for contemplation in the philosopher's cell. And it underscored just how much Calatrava stands out from the usual run of Miyake-clad architectural superstars. </p> <p>He presented his design for a new museum quarter as a family of individual but related projects, with a series of elegant all-white models. They were arranged in sequence, starting with the smallest, a planetarium, and pulling back to reveal more of an apparently endless landscape, entirely the product of Calatrava's feverish imagination. There was a science museum, an opera house, and an arboretum. </p> <p>The models looked frankly unbelievable. So much so that you began to wonder if there might not be something wrong with the scale. They showed buildings that seemed to belong in the same category as one of those Frank Lloyd Wright schemes for a skyscraper a mile high that sometimes haunt the imagination of architects of a certain age, equipped with a sufficiently robust ego. Usually, even when there is a client with just enough cash to pay for the model, they are never actually meant to be built. </p> <p>Calatrava, barely 40 at the time, seemed a bit young to go in for this kind of dreaming. But he already had a whiff of the other-worldly vision that lingers around engineers who profess to find a hidden order in blades of grass, snowflakes and palm trees. </p> <p>As it turns out, they were far from being the architectural fantasies that many people assumed. Ten years later, the project is even bigger than it looked in all those models and in sight of completion. It has gone through a few changes on the way. Plans to build a huge telecommunications mast were pronounced unviable and were dropped, though not before work had started on the foundations. But these were used to support the opera house instead. 'It's like constructing one cathedral on the foundations of another, as was often done in the past,' Calatrava has said of the changes. And other designers have been brought in to work on the landscaping and the adjoining sites. 'It's not all my work, you must understand,' he says, leaving you a little unsure about whether he is being modest or trying to suggest that he would have done things differently. </p> <p>But there is no denying that it adds up to a remarkably powerful piece of architectural planning in the grand manner. In the midst of a scrum of apartment slabs 20 floors high that frame the site, albeit at a respectful distance, the project needed to be big. And big it certainly is. Imagine what it would be like walking through South Kensington if the Natural History Museum, the Science Museum, the Victoria and Albert, and the Crystal Palace were all being built simultaneously, and you get some idea of the pharonic scale. Valencia has caught a particularly virulent strain of the construction bug - fuelled by European Union cash - that is affecting so many contemporary Spanish cities, and not a few in Britain, too. And it has convinced itself that it can make the leap from a dusty provincial backwater on the edge of a virtual desert into the European big league by sheer effort of will and by building enough opera houses, bridges, museums, aquariums and metro stations. </p> <p>A lot of the buildings are complete now. And the city is busy trying to sign up the people with the cachet to fill them, too. Zubin Mehta is being talked of as the musical director for the opera house. A conservatoire is under construction. There is a convention centre designed by Norman Foster. </p> <p>What makes Valencia's complex even more extraordinary is that so much of the work has gone to just one architect. Calatrava, is, to put it mildly, something of a favourite son. He left Valencia for France in 1968 when he was just 16 years old, but came back when his attempts to study art there were thwarted by the May riots. He did his architecture degree at home, then moved to Zurich to do an engineering doctorate. He lives and works in Switzerland, but Valencia still treats Calatrava like a local football hero. It didn't just commission one of his signature bridges, the unmistakable sign of a city with an inferiority complex struggling to make its mark - even Manchester has one now - Valencia actually named its bridge after Calatrava. </p> <p>In fact, Calatrava's home town was relatively slow to discover his special abilities. It was the bridges that he built in Barcelona, swooping like a fully extended long bow, and for the Seville Expo, supported by a single giant mast leaning at a dizzying angle, that really established his reputation. It was the Swiss who gave him his first big architectural commission - a railway station, Stadelhofen, in Zurich - and the French who followed it up by asking him to design the extraordinary TGV station at Lyon's Satolas airport with its roof that soars over the tracks, fanning steel blades in the air, like an eagle feathering its wings. Bilbao signed him up for yet another bridge and about to open his airport. </p> <p>By the time he got to work in Valencia, Calatrava was a tried and tested crowd pleaser. He did buildings that managed to recreate the qualities of traditional architectural monuments in that they could stop the traffic without actually imitating the past directly, in the manner of that other Spanish maverick, Ricardo Bofill. Indeed, they have a way of looking aggressively modern. It was the perfect combination for politicians who wanted to be able to present themselves as being both populists and forward looking. </p> <p>To a wider public to whom most architecture simply looks like a collection of boxes, one indistinguishable from the next, Calatrava's work is something special. You could say that he is like a painter retreating from abstraction, or an atonal composer rediscovering the idea of harmony. </p> <p>He designs complicated show-off structures that demonstrate to even the uninitiated how much effort is going into keeping the building up, or stopping the bridge from wobbling. But unlike hi-tech architects, Calatrava pretties up his structures. He has a fondness for smooth, multiple curves, shaping his buildings like overhanging snowdrifts, or breaking surf. Each individual piece is considered a piece of sculpture, with Brancusi as an acknowledged inspiration. </p> <p>It's an approach that means that he is not as popular with other architects as he is with the crowds that pour over his bridges and come flocking out of the Valencia planetarium still wearing their red-and-green 3D glasses in the sunshine. After the early and undoubtedly brilliant bridges, they find his work beginning to teeter on the edge of kitsch, now that he seems to have added a dash of early Dan Dare and a pinch of Art Deco to his enthusiasm for genetically modified Gothic architecture. In Barcelona, his design for a telecommunications mast immediately next to the city's Olympic stadium, described by its critics as resembling an overgrown radiator mascot from an ancient Buick, sparked an unsuccessful campaign to stop it being built. And in Berlin, Calatrava was embittered enough about losing the competition to rebuild the Reichstag to publically accuse Norman Foster of plagiarism when the British architect was forced by Helmut Kohl to add a glass dome to his winning design. Foster quietly pointed out that while Calatrava's design had indeed included a glass dome, the idea was hardly an original one in Berlin, a city with hundreds of domes to choose from. </p> <p>The approach to Valencia from the airport is through baked-brown scrubland and bare rock, from which undistinguished concrete slabs stud the landscape at aimless intervals, interrupted by the occasional flash of brilliant green where irrigation brings the soil alive. Then as you enter the city, new apartment blocks mushroom everywhere, suddenly dropping back to reveal Calatrava's complex of buildings. His competition-winning master plan for the whole area puts the various elements of what Valencia calls a Science Park in long straight rows along the dried-up riverbed that twists and turns through Valencia, a scar left by the diversion of the Turia river back in the 60s to ensure that there would never be a repetition of the catastrophic flood that devastated the city in 1957. It's a bold formal plan, in an area that has previously lacked a sense of vision in its development. Calatrava says the design is driven by climate. 'In Britain, if you want to keep plants alive, you have to protect them from frost with a glasshouse. It's so hot and dry here, that you have to provide shade and water.' </p> <p>Thus each of the buildings is positioned with its feet in one or other of a series of giant reflecting pools that run the whole length of the site. Calatrava has used them as elements in his composition, counting on night-time reflections to magnify the impact of the buildings. </p> <p>The largest, and for Calatrava the most ambitious, element is the 1,800-seat opera house, due to be completed in three years' time. Not even a master of structural engineering with his track record can avoid the necessity of building a large square fly tower, which gets in the way of his swooping geometries. He has attempted to hide it under a series of flying roofs that contrive to give the building the slightly sinister look of a Samurai helmet. Functionally, they are justified by sheltering a secondary outdoor auditorium that provides an additional 2,500 seats to the main hall. Then comes one of the two bridges that sweep across the riverbed to link new Valencia with the old city. Next in the sequence is the planetarium, the first part of the complex to open for business. </p> <p>Calatrava has hidden the concrete shell that accommodates laser shows and special-effect films inside a secondary shell structure, partly cut open at the edges to provide a degree of shade, connecting it with a network of walkways that reach out all over the site. There are various interpretations of the planetarium's shape. Calatrava's sketches show an eye, its lashes fluttering up. And at night, reflections in the water do indeed have the effect of making the hemispherical dome look like the ball at the centre of an oval eye. But during the day, the two concentric shells make the planetarium look more like a tortoise. Then comes the most flamboyant structure of all, a science museum due to open in September. It has glass walls on all four sides, with a spiny structure of pointed arches holding up a series of platforms inside and out and propped up by what look like twin diving boards, but which actually provide access. </p> <p>The intricate structure rears up against the sky like the bleached bones of some long-dead giant sea creature, beached in the sand. It has the jagged outline not of a lobster exactly, but maybe an even more exotic crustacean, a Morton Bay bug inflated to gigantic scale, perhaps. </p> <p>The fourth structure on the site, also almost complete, is the arboretum that Calatrava has designed: a ribbed set of hoops that will provided a pleasant, shaded walk. </p> <p>With a reputed cost of \u00a32bon, it is a development on an epic scale, one that few cities even twice Valencia's size could contemplate. All the city must do now is hope that the visitors come, and that they find Santiago Calatrava's architecture as fascinating as Valencia does.</p>",

In Barcelona, his design for a telecommunications mast immediately next to the city's Olympic stadium, described by its critics as resembling an overgrown radiator mascot from an ancient Buick, sparked an unsuccessful campaign to stop it being built. And in Berlin, Calatrava was embittered enough about losing the competition to rebuild the Reichstag to publically accuse Norman Foster of plagiarism when the British architect was forced by Helmut Kohl to add a glass dome to his winning design. Foster quietly pointed out that while Calatrava's design had indeed included a glass dome, the idea was hardly an original one in Berlin, a city with hundreds of domes to choose from. The approach to Valencia from the airport is through baked-brown scrubland and bare rock, from which undistinguished concrete slabs stud the landscape at aimless intervals, interrupted by the occasional flash of brilliant green where irrigation brings the soil alive. Then as you enter the city, new apartment blocks mushroom everywhere, suddenly dropping back to reveal Calatrava's complex of buildings. His competition-winning master plan for the whole area puts the various elements of what Valencia calls a Science Park in long straight rows along the dried-up riverbed that twists and turns through Valencia, a scar left by the diversion of the Turia river back in the 60s to ensure that there would never be a repetition of the catastrophic flood that devastated the city in 1957. It's a bold formal plan, in an area that has previously lacked a sense of vision in its development. Calatrava says the design is driven by climate. 'In Britain, if you want to keep plants alive, you have to protect them from frost with a glasshouse. It's so hot and dry here, that you have to provide shade and water.' Thus each of the buildings is positioned with its feet in one or other of a series of giant reflecting pools that run the whole length of the site. Calatrava has used them as elements in his composition, counting on night-time reflections to magnify the impact of the buildings. The largest, and for Calatrava the most ambitious, element is the 1,800-seat opera house, due to be completed in three years' time. Not even a master of structural engineering with his track record can avoid the necessity of building a large square fly tower, which gets in the way of his swooping geometries. He has attempted to hide it under a series of flying roofs that contrive to give the building the slightly sinister look of a Samurai helmet. Functionally, they are justified by sheltering a secondary outdoor auditorium that provides an additional 2,500 seats to the main hall. Then comes one of the two bridges that sweep across the riverbed to link new Valencia with the old city. Next in the sequence is the planetarium, the first part of the complex to open for business. Calatrava has hidden the concrete shell that accommodates laser shows and special-effect films inside a secondary shell structure, partly cut open at the edges to provide a degree of shade, connecting it with a network of walkways that reach out all over the site. There are various interpretations of the planetarium's shape. Calatrava's sketches show an eye, its lashes fluttering up. And at night, reflections in the water do indeed have the effect of making the hemispherical dome look like the ball at the centre of an oval eye. But during the day, the two concentric shells make the planetarium look more like a tortoise. Then comes the most flamboyant structure of all, a science museum due to open in September. It has glass walls on all four sides, with a spiny structure of pointed arches holding up a series of platforms inside and out and propped up by what look like twin diving boards, but which actually provide access. The intricate structure rears up against the sky like the bleached bones of some long-dead giant sea creature, beached in the sand. It has the jagged outline not of a lobster exactly, but maybe an even more exotic crustacean, a Morton Bay bug inflated to gigantic scale, perhaps. The fourth structure on the site, also almost complete, is the arboretum that Calatrava has designed: a ribbed set of hoops that will provided a pleasant, shaded walk. With a reputed cost of \u00a32bon, it is a development on an epic scale, one that few cities even twice Valencia's size could contemplate. All the city must do now is hope that the visitors come, and that they find Santiago Calatrava's architecture as fascinating as Valencia does.",

      "body": "<p>I 'm standing on the crest of a hill, around 15 miles up the coast from Montego Bay. A hot and bothered video crew waits for British comedian Richard Blackwood, who is in Jamaica to film the video for his forthcoming single. '1,2,3,4 Get with the Wicked' can be heard rippling across the countryside. </p> <p>Blackwood's rise to the forefront of black comedy - and now late-night light entertainment - has been little short of miraculous. His career as a stand-up began only six years ago, at the age of 22, and has seen a quick progression from the margins to the mainstream. A little over three years ago, he was still an undercard performer at the Hackney Empire. Then he was offered regular slots on MTV. Last year, The Richard Blackwood Show was unleashed on Channel 4, drawing in more than 1 million viewers a week and establishing him as a brand. And now, with a hit single, he has been called a British Will Smith. </p> <p>Black British comedy has failed to define itself on national TV since The Lenny Henry Show a decade ago. And in Blackwood - young, apolitical and with a style that goes down as easily as Coke - the genre has a totem around which to gather. Even in his late-night slot, Blackwood has managed to corral together an impressive array of guests - LL Cool J, Don King, Prince Naseem and Mel B. Now, standing before me at the shoot, he nods in acknowledgement. 'We'll have a chat later,' he says. 'Gotta earn my crust first.' He returns to the video - a romantic escape scenario, in which he attempts to outrun the father of the female lead. </p> <p>Throughout the afternoon, filming progresses at a painstakingly slow pace. As his friends amuse themselves, Blackwood looks on at the huddles of figures, occasionally strolling over for a chat. He is always well groomed, his little goatee seemingly drawn on to his face with a thick crayon. Those big, dark eyes blink perhaps slightly too fast - and the mouth has an uncanny knack of breaking into a happy-to-see-you grin. </p> <p>Comedians are almost always too busy with self-flagellation to bother with their immediate surroundings. But Blackwood - with his \u00fcber-slick presentation - has little in common with most other comics. His isn't a personality constructed out of gags and clever one-liners. In fact, throughout the two-day shoot he rarely cracks a smile from his co-workers, preferring instead to listen quietly and appreciatively to their gags. </p> <p>Later that evening, Blackwood walks over to my table near the bar. He is simply dressed in casual wear - baggies cut off below the shins, a T-shirt and his trademark diamond-studded earring. Thankfully, he seems to betray none of the surly introspection that typifies most comedians. When I inform him that I had watched consecutive videos of his MTV performances, The Richard Blackwood Show ' and a guest slot on the Jo Whiley Show, he only grins politely. 'You got a triple dose, huh?' he offers. 'Must have been tough.' </p> <p> Richard Blackwood grew up in Streatham, south London, in the mid-70s, the product of a stable family environment. He doesn't smoke or drink. His only moment of rebellion, he admits, was at the age of 16, when he took to selling bootleg pornographic videos. </p> <p>While he was at college studying for a business degree, he was already meeting agents, and by the time he graduated he was ready to launch himself into the black comedy circuit. 'I couldn't believe people were willing to pay for this stuff,' he says. His father married model Naomi Campbell's mother, Valerie, when Blackwood was 10 and Naomi was 12. The two never shared a home - he lived nearby with his grandparents, his mother having moved to Sweden - but were close as teenagers in the years before she started her modelling career. </p> <p>'We were closer when we were younger - then my dad and her mum split up. She's got her life to lead, and I have my own. Remember, we were only together for a short space of time; our parents were together for only seven years. But we speak from time to time. Naomi's good people. She was a good sister for a long time: she saw me at the clubs. We still talk.' </p> <p>He has rarely spoken about his half-sister before, and now excitedly relates an anecdote. 'She told me she was seeing Mike Tyson,' he giggles. 'We were sitting in my room - and she told me she'd started going out with him. I was just too shocked - in fact, I didn't believe her.' </p> <p>Throughout the interview, Blackwood speaks of business plans - for the immediate and the future. I recall a passage from American variety performer Bob Hope's 1954 memoir, Bob Hope's Own Story: Have Tux, Will Travel . Always surrounded by a production line of writers who were permanently on call, Hope took to phoning his jokesmiths day and night. 'Thrill me,' he'd simply say. </p> <p>'I'm not like that at all,' breathes Blackwood, genuinely astonished. 'I guess TV makes you lazy - and I do less and less stand-up. I have other people helping me write, but TV is much more disciplined. You only have so much time, and the whole thing is rehearsed to a point beyond professionalism. Modern comedy is much more slick now, remember. Can't be cussin' and swearin' on MTV. There's always a script that goes through various sets of people. The networks don't like mavericks these days - so I have to play ball.' </p> <p>Blackwood's debut album, the cautiously titled I Know You'd Love to Hate This won't give New York's underground rap scene any worrying thoughts of a rival British explosion. With its rhythmically populist, distilled ragga beats and pan-Atlantic cultural references, the album makes for entertaining, if inoffensive, listening. And Blackwood is the first to acknowledge his musical limitations. </p> <p>'I grew up listening to people like Eric B &amp; Rakim, and Run DMC. But I wouldn't even begin to compare myself to them. If you're going to take my rap thing seriously, then you're not getting it. I'm trying to make it fun: it's an extension of the comedy. I'm trying to bring that aspect of my show to the music - nothing more, nothing less.' </p> <p>The defence of his music comes across as almost fidgety, agitated to a degree of calm ferocity. Earlier, his manager, Beverley Randall, had told me: 'The first time I saw him, I told him I wouldn't manage him. And he was astounded. \"It's because you're too hungry,\" I said. He just seemed to want it all so badly. It was like watching pure ambition drip off someone.' </p> <p>He was recently signed to a record label in a deal reputedly worth \u00a31m. An 11-track collection of pleasant-enough street anthems, the album includes his debut single, the Top Ten hit 'Mama - Who Da Man?' The record has, for the most part, been produced by his uncle, Junior Giscombe, who himself had a hit single, 'Mama Used to Say', back in 1982. </p> <p>Black urban polymaths are still an American phenomenon. Richard Pryor, Eddie Murphy, Martin Lawrence and Will Smith (the latter is Blackwood's blueprint for success) all personify the post-civil rights delirium of capital-led franchises supplemented by both stage and screen. The brashly political tones of black American comedy, obsessed by output, aggrandisement and celebrity, are unique to the African-American psyche. </p> <p>British comedians are often characterised by their geeky behaviour. The profession attracts a certain kind of social misfit - all those hours spent holed up in bedrooms scribbling one-liners on the back of cereal packets must require a unique brand of vanity. </p> <p>'You're right,' admits Blackwood, earnestly. 'Comedy is just one of those careers - it seems to attract all the odds and ends of society. The kind of people who know they're funny long before any of their friends realise it.' Between thumb and forefinger, he starts to stroke his beard. 'Me? Was I that geeky? Yeah. If I had a gig on Friday, you could probably speak to me on Monday - from then on, I was hiding somewhere, rehearsing. I already had the material, I just wanted to perfect the delivery.' </p> <p>Compared to Lenny Henry - who peeled back the institutionalised racism of the 1980s while providing a dim promise of hope to the Black left - Blackwood's one-liners supply playful jokes that easily pacify an apolitical generation. Even on the rare occasions when he has dropped all cued caution, his well-oiled professionalism re-programmes his routine back on message. </p> <p>'I made this joke about the Queen once,' he says. 'I said, \"The bitch has her face on money, and she looks bored. If my face was on money, I'd never look bored.\" I never should have said it - there was no need for it. I have nothing against the Queen: it's not like I know her. I'm wary about swearing too much - but at the same time, I don't want to avoid the issues of the day. I felt guilty about that one for a while afterwards.' Yet, only minutes later, he contradicts this very assertion. 'I'll always say what I think. I'm never going to hold back. 'Cos Richard Blackwood is always raw.' </p> <p>Like most comedians, Blackwood feels a need to justify his humour; this he does in almost religious detail. 'People get angry when they hear certain things - I asked Don King how he pulled off that fight in Zaire in the middle of the jungle. I mean, there were no toilets there. So how did he pull it off? A couple of days later, this woman grabs me in the street. \"I'm from Zaire,\" she says. \"Why did you portray Zaire like that on your show?\" I had to explain to her I was talking about that part of Zaire. I've got the thing on tape to back me up.' </p> <p>There's that seriousness again - comedians, I reckon, spend too much time making other people laugh to ever treat themselves in a self-deprecating manner. Blackwood ignores the comment - he has warmed to his theme of Black conservatism. </p> <p>'People are trying too hard to emulate negativity,' he pronounces. 'Kids nowadays know that it's fashionable to be hard. They listen to rappers talking about ghetto life, and understandably the kids want some of that. They don't equate money with hard work. They just see Puff Daddy with all his diamonds. None of the kids know it took him around a decade of hard work to put that together. And, more to the point, kids just don't have those positive role models any more.' </p> <p>Later on, I carry a chair over to Giscombe's table, near the edge of the video shoot. Behind us, Blackwood and his friends squeal down the hill on shop-worn mopeds - even in the heat, and with the director suffering from sunstroke, the chase sequence will require a number of takes. </p> <p>Over curried saltfish, lightly fried chicken and freshly sliced pineapples, Giscombe dispenses weighty chapters from his encyclopedic knowledge of modern pop. With his wire-rimmed spectacles, knee-length blue shorts and multi-hued trainers, he's likeable company - peppering his sentences with an agreeable 'thank you'. 'You think the record industry is short of singer-songwriters? Thank you. My point exactly: all the major labels are thinking of easy money with boy bands. And just think of all these kids that'll be washed up by the age of 20. Thank you.' </p> <p>He smiles, watching Blackwood career past on his moped at dangerous speeds. The comedian seems oblivious to his sex appeal on the set - and you sense that he rarely deviates from his determined business plans. Rubbing his glasses on his vest, Giscombe laughs - it's the quiet, knowing giggle of an industry veteran. In his previous incarnation as a pop star, he relished all the hospitality that followed his career - famously appearing at the Soul Train awards to promote his hit single. 'Look at him, having fun,' he says now. 'He's working hard - but these are the days for it. All the effort will pay off.' </p> <p>Blackwood Inc, admits Giscombe, is a hypothetical conglomerate of his own founding. According to plan, the comedian's r\u00e9sum\u00e9 should eventually index his credentials across all the sub-registries of the digital age - cinema, music, the internet and light entertainment. 'You buy a computer, you want it to do all kinds of things,' he says, by way of explanation. 'Entertainers are the same. Being a jack of all trades is important right now. Look at Michael Jordan: he's a one-man industry.' </p> <p>Giscombe strolls over to the catering tent for a glass of water. On the surface, he seems to cloak any ambition with neighbourly humour. But stretching out an arm to shield himself from the mid-afternoon sun, he casually lets slip his hopes for his nephew. 'How far will Richard go? That's up to him - it depends on how badly he wants it. I want this boy to go all the way, and I believe he can make it.' He wheels around to face me. 'Let's face it, nothing's for ever,' he adds. Giscombe could now be talking about himself; his already hushed tones seem drowned by the memory of that hit single, now almost 20 years ago. 'Richard has to make the most of the momentum. It's all about branding him on to the international map - after that, there are no limiting factors.' </p> <p> That afternoon, Blackwood had sat silently in the back of the minivan as the film crews made their way to the next location. His co-star in the video, and a guest on I Know You'd Love to Hate This, General Levy dragged on a joint behind him. A drum'n'bass producer of significant reputation, Levy enjoyed notable success in the early 90s: his maniacal features were on regular display in style bibles such as The Face ' and i-D . </p> <p>'Jamaican women have strange feet,' Levy pondered, loudly, half-stoned. 'They're rough at the bottom - you could light matches from them soles. Man, them feet are rough - they could tear your flesh off. Feet like that are like weapons. I'd do anything for a Jamaican woman, except rub her feet. It's 'cos they is always walking - look at 'em.' He said, regretfully: 'Love Jamaican women - just can' take the feet, though. Dem is too rough.' </p> <p>Levy's light-hearted banter had the mini-van's occupants in hysterics - vendors peered up from their stalls to gawk at the helplessly creased faces trundling past them. Blackwood, though, seemed distracted, gazing sternly out of the window. </p> <p>That afternoon I'd said to him: 'The Black press has been especially cruel in its denunciation of your music.' 'Yeah,' he'd sighed. 'I don't know why - I really don't know why. Maybe it's that British thing of knocking someone down.' He looked momentarily hurt, gazing forlornly out of the window, his eyes hiding behind a thick pair of wrap-around sunglasses. </p> <p>The vilification of Blackwood in the ethnic press poses an obviously interesting question about the trappings of free Black enterprise in the UK. In the US, basketball stars like Shaquille O'Neal and Denis Rodman - the most implausible of musical talents - have both released big-selling rap albums to little critical abuse. And comedian Chris Rock's 'Roll with It' and 'Bigger and Blacker' have both featured interpolated musical collaborations with rap auteur Prince Paul. </p> <p>Yet Blackwood, to his considerable mystification, while previously glorified by newspapers and magazines such as New Nation , Hip-Hop Connection and Touch Magazine has, in recent months, seen his musical venture systematically scorned, then ridiculed. 'People don't have a problem with someone like Will Smith rapping: he doesn't take himself too seriously,' says Vince Jackson, editor of Touch Magazine . 'Blackwood, on the other hand, seems to act like he means it. There is another argument - and maybe this might be a little cruel. As a rapper, Richard simply isn't very good.' </p> <p>'That's not the point at all,' Giscombe told me minutes before I left Jamaica. 'We're not saying he's a great rapper - we're saying he's an entertainer.' Blackwood's uncle sighed, giving me a parting hug. Then he darted back to his project - the branding of Richard Blackwood. I left, an old Bob Hope gag in my mind: in his 1996 compendium of presidential one-liners, Dear Prez, I Wanna Tell Ya , perhaps fazed by the criticism over his conservative stance over the Vietnamese war, Hope wrote: 'Laughter is non-partisan.' </p> <p>Blackwood's career - ever soaring, over-achieving, easily digestible - says much about the current state of black comedy. A decade ago, The Richard Blackwood Show would have rendered him a paradox - out of touch with the common ground against Thatcherism. These days, however, an apolitical nuance is a marketable attribute. Late- night entertainment - once by definition virulently leftwing and sociopolitical - has returned to the chirpy, hippy, happy heyday of the 70s. It should help turn Blackwood into a star of these times.</p> <p>\u0095 Richard Blackwood's new single, '1,2,3,4 Get with the Wicked', is released on 4 September</p>",

      "bodyText": "I 'm standing on the crest of a hill, around 15 miles up the coast from Montego Bay. A hot and bothered video crew waits for British comedian Richard Blackwood, who is in Jamaica to film the video for his forthcoming single. '1,2,3,4 Get with the Wicked' can be heard rippling across the countryside. Blackwood's rise to the forefront of black comedy - and now late-night light entertainment - has been little short of miraculous. His career as a stand-up began only six years ago, at the age of 22, and has seen a quick progression from the margins to the mainstream. A little over three years ago, he was still an undercard performer at the Hackney Empire. Then he was offered regular slots on MTV. Last year, The Richard Blackwood Show was unleashed on Channel 4, drawing in more than 1 million viewers a week and establishing him as a brand. And now, with a hit single, he has been called a British Will Smith. Black British comedy has failed to define itself on national TV since The Lenny Henry Show a decade ago. And in Blackwood - young, apolitical and with a style that goes down as easily as Coke - the genre has a totem around which to gather. Even in his late-night slot, Blackwood has managed to corral together an impressive array of guests - LL Cool J, Don King, Prince Naseem and Mel B. Now, standing before me at the shoot, he nods in acknowledgement. 'We'll have a chat later,' he says. 'Gotta earn my crust first.' He returns to the video - a romantic escape scenario, in which he attempts to outrun the father of the female lead. Throughout the afternoon, filming progresses at a painstakingly slow pace. As his friends amuse themselves, Blackwood looks on at the huddles of figures, occasionally strolling over for a chat. He is always well groomed, his little goatee seemingly drawn on to his face with a thick crayon. Those big, dark eyes blink perhaps slightly too fast - and the mouth has an uncanny knack of breaking into a happy-to-see-you grin. Comedians are almost always too busy with self-flagellation to bother with their immediate surroundings. But Blackwood - with his \u00fcber-slick presentation - has little in common with most other comics. His isn't a personality constructed out of gags and clever one-liners. In fact, throughout the two-day shoot he rarely cracks a smile from his co-workers, preferring instead to listen quietly and appreciatively to their gags. Later that evening, Blackwood walks over to my table near the bar. He is simply dressed in casual wear - baggies cut off below the shins, a T-shirt and his trademark diamond-studded earring. Thankfully, he seems to betray none of the surly introspection that typifies most comedians. When I inform him that I had watched consecutive videos of his MTV performances, The Richard Blackwood Show ' and a guest slot on the Jo Whiley Show, he only grins politely. 'You got a triple dose, huh?' he offers. 'Must have been tough.' Richard Blackwood grew up in Streatham, south London, in the mid-70s, the product of a stable family environment. He doesn't smoke or drink. His only moment of rebellion, he admits, was at the age of 16, when he took to selling bootleg pornographic videos. While he was at college studying for a business degree, he was already meeting agents, and by the time he graduated he was ready to launch himself into the black comedy circuit. 'I couldn't believe people were willing to pay for this stuff,' he says. His father married model Naomi Campbell's mother, Valerie, when Blackwood was 10 and Naomi was 12. The two never shared a home - he lived nearby with his grandparents, his mother having moved to Sweden - but were close as teenagers in the years before she started her modelling career. 'We were closer when we were younger - then my dad and her mum split up. She's got her life to lead, and I have my own. Remember, we were only together for a short space of time; our parents were together for only seven years. But we speak from time to time. Naomi's good people. She was a good sister for a long time: she saw me at the clubs. We still talk.' He has rarely spoken about his half-sister before, and now excitedly relates an anecdote. 'She told me she was seeing Mike Tyson,' he giggles. 'We were sitting in my room - and she told me she'd started going out with him. I was just too shocked - in fact, I didn't believe her.' Throughout the interview, Blackwood speaks of business plans - for the immediate and the future. I recall a passage from American variety performer Bob Hope's 1954 memoir, Bob Hope's Own Story: Have Tux, Will Travel . Always surrounded by a production line of writers who were permanently on call, Hope took to phoning his jokesmiths day and night. 'Thrill me,' he'd simply say. 'I'm not like that at all,' breathes Blackwood, genuinely astonished. 'I guess TV makes you lazy - and I do less and less stand-up. I have other people helping me write, but TV is much more disciplined. You only have so much time, and the whole thing is rehearsed to a point beyond professionalism. Modern comedy is much more slick now, remember. Can't be cussin' and swearin' on MTV. There's always a script that goes through various sets of people. The networks don't like mavericks these days - so I have to play ball.' Blackwood's debut album, the cautiously titled I Know You'd Love to Hate This won't give New York's underground rap scene any worrying thoughts of a rival British explosion. With its rhythmically populist, distilled ragga beats and pan-Atlantic cultural references, the album makes for entertaining, if inoffensive, listening. And Blackwood is the first to acknowledge his musical limitations. 'I grew up listening to people like Eric B &amp; Rakim, and Run DMC. But I wouldn't even begin to compare myself to them. If you're going to take my rap thing seriously, then you're not getting it. I'm trying to make it fun: it's an extension of the comedy. I'm trying to bring that aspect of my show to the music - nothing more, nothing less.' The defence of his music comes across as almost fidgety, agitated to a degree of calm ferocity. Earlier, his manager, Beverley Randall, had told me: 'The first time I saw him, I told him I wouldn't manage him. And he was astounded. \"It's because you're too hungry,\" I said. He just seemed to want it all so badly. It was like watching pure ambition drip off someone.' He was recently signed to a record label in a deal reputedly worth \u00a31m. An 11-track collection of pleasant-enough street anthems, the album includes his debut single, the Top Ten hit 'Mama - Who Da Man?' The record has, for the most part, been produced by his uncle, Junior Giscombe, who himself had a hit single, 'Mama Used to Say', back in 1982. Black urban polymaths are still an American phenomenon. Richard Pryor, Eddie Murphy, Martin Lawrence and Will Smith (the latter is Blackwood's blueprint for success) all personify the post-civil rights delirium of capital-led franchises supplemented by both stage and screen. The brashly political tones of black American comedy, obsessed by output, aggrandisement and celebrity, are unique to the African-American psyche. British comedians are often characterised by their geeky behaviour. The profession attracts a certain kind of social misfit - all those hours spent holed up in bedrooms scribbling one-liners on the back of cereal packets must require a unique brand of vanity. 'You're right,' admits Blackwood, earnestly. 'Comedy is just one of those careers - it seems to attract all the odds and ends of society. The kind of people who know they're funny long before any of their friends realise it.' Between thumb and forefinger, he starts to stroke his beard. 'Me? Was I that geeky? Yeah. If I had a gig on Friday, you could probably speak to me on Monday - from then on, I was hiding somewhere, rehearsing. I already had the material, I just wanted to perfect the delivery.' Compared to Lenny Henry - who peeled back the institutionalised racism of the 1980s while providing a dim promise of hope to the Black left - Blackwood's one-liners supply playful jokes that easily pacify an apolitical generation. Even on the rare occasions when he has dropped all cued caution, his well-oiled professionalism re-programmes his routine back on message. 'I made this joke about the Queen once,' he says. 'I said, \"The bitch has her face on money, and she looks bored. If my face was on money, I'd never look bored.\" I never should have said it - there was no need for it. I have nothing against the Queen: it's not like I know her. I'm wary about swearing too much - but at the same time, I don't want to avoid the issues of the day. I felt guilty about that one for a while afterwards.' Yet, only minutes later, he contradicts this very assertion. 'I'll always say what I think. I'm never going to hold back. 'Cos Richard Blackwood is always raw.' Like most comedians, Blackwood feels a need to justify his humour; this he does in almost religious detail. 'People get angry when they hear certain things - I asked Don King how he pulled off that fight in Zaire in the middle of the jungle. I mean, there were no toilets there. So how did he pull it off? A couple of days later, this woman grabs me in the street. \"I'm from Zaire,\" she says. \"Why did you portray Zaire like that on your show?\" I had to explain to her I was talking about that part of Zaire. I've got the thing on tape to back me up.' There's that seriousness again - comedians, I reckon, spend too much time making other people laugh to ever treat themselves in a self-deprecating manner. Blackwood ignores the comment - he has warmed to his theme of Black conservatism. 'People are trying too hard to emulate negativity,' he pronounces. 'Kids nowadays know that it's fashionable to be hard. They listen to rappers talking about ghetto life, and understandably the kids want some of that. They don't equate money with hard work. They just see Puff Daddy with all his diamonds. None of the kids know it took him around a decade of hard work to put that together. And, more to the point, kids just don't have those positive role models any more.' Later on, I carry a chair over to Giscombe's table, near the edge of the video shoot. Behind us, Blackwood and his friends squeal down the hill on shop-worn mopeds - even in the heat, and with the director suffering from sunstroke, the chase sequence will require a number of takes. Over curried saltfish, lightly fried chicken and freshly sliced pineapples, Giscombe dispenses weighty chapters from his encyclopedic knowledge of modern pop. With his wire-rimmed spectacles, knee-length blue shorts and multi-hued trainers, he's likeable company - peppering his sentences with an agreeable 'thank you'. 'You think the record industry is short of singer-songwriters? Thank you. My point exactly: all the major labels are thinking of easy money with boy bands. And just think of all these kids that'll be washed up by the age of 20. Thank you.' He smiles, watching Blackwood career past on his moped at dangerous speeds. The comedian seems oblivious to his sex appeal on the set - and you sense that he rarely deviates from his determined business plans. Rubbing his glasses on his vest, Giscombe laughs - it's the quiet, knowing giggle of an industry veteran. In his previous incarnation as a pop star, he relished all the hospitality that followed his career - famously appearing at the Soul Train awards to promote his hit single. 'Look at him, having fun,' he says now. 'He's working hard - but these are the days for it. All the effort will pay off.' Blackwood Inc, admits Giscombe, is a hypothetical conglomerate of his own founding. According to plan, the comedian's r\u00e9sum\u00e9 should eventually index his credentials across all the sub-registries of the digital age - cinema, music, the internet and light entertainment. 'You buy a computer, you want it to do all kinds of things,' he says, by way of explanation. 'Entertainers are the same. Being a jack of all trades is important right now. Look at Michael Jordan: he's a one-man industry.' Giscombe strolls over to the catering tent for a glass of water. On the surface, he seems to cloak any ambition with neighbourly humour. But stretching out an arm to shield himself from the mid-afternoon sun, he casually lets slip his hopes for his nephew. 'How far will Richard go? That's up to him - it depends on how badly he wants it. I want this boy to go all the way, and I believe he can make it.' He wheels around to face me. 'Let's face it, nothing's for ever,' he adds. Giscombe could now be talking about himself; his already hushed tones seem drowned by the memory of that hit single, now almost 20 years ago. 'Richard has to make the most of the momentum. It's all about branding him on to the international map - after that, there are no limiting factors.' That afternoon, Blackwood had sat silently in the back of the minivan as the film crews made their way to the next location. His co-star in the video, and a guest on I Know You'd Love to Hate This, General Levy dragged on a joint behind him. A drum'n'bass producer of significant reputation, Levy enjoyed notable success in the early 90s: his maniacal features were on regular display in style bibles such as The Face ' and i-D . 'Jamaican women have strange feet,' Levy pondered, loudly, half-stoned. 'They're rough at the bottom - you could light matches from them soles. Man, them feet are rough - they could tear your flesh off. Feet like that are like weapons. I'd do anything for a Jamaican woman, except rub her feet. It's 'cos they is always walking - look at 'em.' He said, regretfully: 'Love Jamaican women - just can' take the feet, though. Dem is too rough.'

      "body": "<p>The Hotel Providence stands at the intersection of Grand Street and the Bowery in lower Manhattan, a nondescript five-story brick building diagonally across from the Romanesque columns of the long-defunct Bowery Savings Bank. To the west is the bustle of Little Italy and SoHo; to the east are Latino neighbourhoods and the bars and bistros of the gentrifying Lower East Side. The fa\u00e7ade of the Hotel Providence is chipped, the paint the colour of wan flesh, and the sign advertising its presence is small, inconspicuous in the riot of billboards and store fronts. Days on the Bowery, the streets of Chinatown surrounding the hotel are teeming with pedestrians; passers-by hurry along the pavement without a sideward glance. Nights, after the lighting-fixture and restaurant-supply stores have rolled down their metal sliding doors, the avenue is deserted, lit only by the thin yellow glow of street lights and of traffic slowly making its way downtown.</p> <p>The entrance to the Providence is wedged between a Chinese restaurant and a vegetable market. Inside, beyond the two or three men always loitering in the doorway, a single, steep flight of stairs leads up to a landing, where a clerk sits at the front desk behind a thick glass cage. To the left, there are steel doors that can be opened only by a security buzzer. No Visitor, the notices at the front desk say, Rent Must Be Paid in 24 Hours Or Room Will Be Emptied, Starting Now People Throwing Something Out The Window Will Be Kicked Out. Rooms at the Providence are let to men only; the price is $10 a night, payment in cash, in advance. Like the few other flophouses still left on America's legendary skid row - the World, the Grand, the Sunshine, the White House, the Prince - the Providence is a remnant from a time when dozens of Bowery hotels offered refuge, of a kind, for a man in need of shelter and alone in the world. In the early 20th century, when bars and hotels lined the street, some 25,000 men lived on the Bowery. Now, the best estimate is that 6,000 men in New York City are without shelter every night, but there are rooms for only 1,500 on the avenue. There is rarely a vacancy at the Providence; the place has 224 boxes crammed into four small floors, and every night the joint is packed.</p> <p>Bowery flophouses have long offered men a convenient location, with few questions asked and the freedom to come and go. The alternatives are few. In the run-down quarter of Far Rockaway, Queens - 21 rail miles, 57 minutes, and a $1.50 subway fare away from the soup kitchens, social services offices, and methadone clinics of Manhattan - there are a growing number of homes illegally operating as boarding houses. And in poorer neighbourhoods throughout New York City's five boroughs, there are furnished basements and spare rooms, rentable on a weekly basis, a trade that is generally under the table and unregulated. After those options, which both usually require a security deposit and as much as a month's rent up front, the choices narrow and harden: a free cot in a city-run shelter, with wide open rooms and military camp-like rules, and rampant crime; a bed in one of the few church-run missions that continue to operate in lower Manhattan, with the religious services and demands of sobriety; or finally, living rough on the street.</p> <p>Very late one night at the beginning of October 1999, I walked up the stairs of the Hotel Providence. There was a vacancy, so I paid the $10, plus a $5 key deposit, intending to report on a month in the lives of the men and the hotel. For decades, the Providence had been one of a string of Bowery flophouses owned by the same corporation, but recently they had brought in new management. The new operators are Chinese and their sides of conversations about paying rent, trying to pick up mail, and complaints were shouted across the front desk in fractured English.</p> <p>On the second floor of the hotel, at the far side of the security door, a short dark corridor opened into a large room with high, echoing ceilings and scattered tables and chairs. The lobby was littered with full ashtrays and sleeping cats, and half-dressed men drifted in and out; here was the only gathering place in the hotel, the only place to sit out of the weather, eat, have a few beers, watch Wheel of Fortune on the old television propped in a corner. The marble floor was cracked and riven with grime, the air thick with the smells of men left to their own devices. The windows were stained brown by generations of cigarette smoke and soot; it was impossible to see into the hotel from the street, impossible to see out from the lobby.</p> <p>At night, before the alcohol and drugs had taken hold, the talk in the lobby was muted and friendly: 'How'd you eat today?' 'Got an extra smoke?' 'Burger King has a special, a Whopper for 99 cents, a buck seven with tax.' The roach-ends of joints were passed around and tips about horse races and soup kitchens were exchanged - the closest thing the men had to society - until, at 9.30 or so, a few of the regulars went down to the street to bring up boxes filled with sandwiches, oranges and cartons of milk donated by the Coalition for the Homeless, and the food was set upon, wolf like.</p> <p>The men went by first names, nicknames, jail names, aliases: the point of staying in the hotel was to be left alone, to hide from the law, family, creditors, the past, oneself - and the men I met agreed to let me write about them on the condition that I didn't reveal their real identities. Many had become permanent residents of the Providence, some having lived there for decades, and they had gained the legal rights of tenants under New York law: their rent raises were controlled by the city in accordance with the rate at the time the man first moved in. Some men were still paying as little as $4 or $5 a night and, in theory at least, they had recourse to the courts and police to ensure that they are not evicted. New arrivals, classified as temporary residents, faced a rule that wasn't posted but that was universal on the Bowery and strictly applied: the most time that the managers permitted a newcomer to stay was 21 nights in a row. The days each new arrival spent in the Providence were carefully marked in the ledger book, and at the end of 21 days, he was required to leave the hotel for a night or two before he was allowed to return.</p> <p>The hotel lobby, the point of return at dark, filled with men as the sun set and the coming winter began to chill the nights. The men were mostly white and Hispanic. The permanent residents and regulars, like Raul, were in their late thirties and forties and older, although many looked years and even decades beyond their years. Stevie, a gaunt methadone junkie, his complexion deathly pale, sat at a table and drank a bottle of Wild Irish Rose; Turk, dressed in shorts and a canvas sun hat, shared the leftover won ton and tofu he collected from a Chinese restaurant across the street. In one corner, a man silently played scales on his portable Casino electric piano, the headphones askew, his face expressionless. Another man, who couldn't muster the price of a room but was allowed to spend his evenings in the lobby, tried to sell anything he had come across in his wanderings that might have value: Bic razors, a broken watch, a snowsuit. The transients were younger, in their twenties and thirties; new men turned up in the lobby on most nights.</p> <p>The Providence was originally built in the 1880s as a place for sailors to sleep off their shore-leave drinks. At the time, places like the Providence were known as 'cage hotels' - then, as now, the 'rooms' weren't, in any real sense, rooms at all: most were cubicles measuring 3.5ft wide, 6ft long and 8ft high. The walls were flimsy wooden partitions; there were no windows in most rooms, and chicken wire was strung over the top in place of a ceiling. Among the varieties of shelter once available on the Bowery - 'barrel houses', which provided a place to sit out of the rain in exchange for the purchase of keg beer; 'rope houses', with ropes strung across the room for men to lean against as they tried to sleep standing up; 'flophouses', often amounting to nothing more than a roof overhead and a space on the floor of an open room - the cage hotels, with a private 'room' and chicken-wire ceilings, were relatively upmarket; they have become what are now known generically as flophouses.</p> <p>The second floor of the Providence was divided between the lobby and rooms mostly occupied by permanent residents. Upstairs, each of the floors had reputations for violence and danger that varied depending on who was talking: the third floor was safe, the fourth and fifth infested with drug dealers; the fourth was all right, but the third and fifth were risky. My room was on the fourth floor, near Stevie's. Whenever I opened the door, I was met by a waft of rank, dead air. Inside, a rickety metal-frame cot with a piece of plywood under a wafer-thin mattress and covered by a single torn sheet pocked with cigarette burns; pillows and blanket weren't provided. The room was painted in two tones, dull green and dull red, and there was one exposed light bulb and one hook and Spanish graffiti scratched on the wall next to a faded poster of an Indian chief and a note taped in a corner that said, 'Just a reminder_ to keep trying.' The bathroom was at the far end of the floor, four toilet stalls for more than 60 men, the tiling cracked and filthy and marked with scrawlings saying Flush Don't Be A Pig, and threats and counter-threats, claims and counterclaims that someone was a Homo who Takes It Up The Ass. In the dead of night, the man in the next room moaned in his sleep, his low cries joining the chorus of hacking coughs and wheezes and the deep, guttural rasp of throat-cleared phlegm sounding throughout the hotel. Roaches crawled across the floor and walls, and small, airborne, biting midges lit on the sheets. Some men tried to control these plagues with sprays and chemical bombs, but most just learned to live with them. That first night I didn't sleep at all.</p> <p>Mornings came early at the Providence, stirrings beginning just after dawn, voices calling out, televisions turned on, radios tuned to Howard Stern and salsa and all-news stations. Sleepout Jackie, a long-time resident, lived a few doors away on the fourth floor. Sleepout ran a kind of restaurant from his room - a 'chuck wagon', he called it - and he sold heros and meatball sandwiches for a dollar each. Sleepout said he had been attacked with a machete once, and he stayed clear of the lobby at night because there were too many fights. Stevie, the methadone junkie who lived one hallway over, had battled with Sleepout, and Sleepout had thrown buckets of cold water through the chicken wire of Stevie's room.</p> <p>In the Providence, I soon discovered, there was little interaction among the men, apart from the evening gatherings in the lobby, and in a nook at the back of the second floor, where some went to smoke joints. The rooms were too small to fit a visitor. Conversations in the hallways and the stairs were brief and perfunctory; the long-time residents knew each other, and took vague notice of comings and goings, of illnesses and arrests and deaths, but there were few friendships. There were occasional low-budget visitors stopping in the hotel, like the college graduate from the Midwest who worked as a bike courier in Manhattan and who quick-stepped his way to his room each evening, or the two young French hipsters in black leather pants and silk shirts who checked in one night to cop heroin. For the residents, though, the Providence's drug dealers were a constant and watchful presence. Sleep was difficult, impossible when a drunken argument started. The stench was close and tangible, the temper lawless.</p> <p>Detective Robert Sushinsky from the Fifth Precinct, who regularly checked the hotel's register for men with outstanding warrants, and who was often called to the hotel to collect the corpse of an alcoholic or junkie who had died in his sleep, told me the police wouldn't send undercover cops into the hotel because most of the men there had done time in jail and they could smell anyone who didn't belong there. It was too dangerous, he said, not worth risking an officer's life.</p> <p>In mid-October the new management of the Providence began to renovate the premises. Sheets of drywall and planks of lumber were stacked in a corner of the second-floor lobby, their purpose unexplained. On the fifth floor, workers were adding steel caging to the tops of the rooms; the caging reached to the ceiling and made it impossible for men to climb the walls and cut the chicken wire and sneak into their rooms, or into another man's room. The toilets on the fifth floor were being torn out, to be replaced with two new toilets and two shower stalls; the showers were new, but now there were two fewer toilets. The management was slowly working its way down through the hotel, Stevie said, and they were going to add the caging and redo the bathrooms on all the floors. Meanwhile, for the permanent residents, there was routine - eat, sleep, try to hold down a minimum wage job maybe, wait for a welfare check to arrive at the front desk, somehow get the money to cop drugs, watch game shows and ball games in the lobby.</p> <p>Raul came to the lobby every night near the time the food from the Coalition for the Homeless arrived; he relied on the lobby, he said. The 21-day limit applied at Raul's flophouse, as it did at most of the Bowery hotels still open for business, but Raul said he had made a 'lease request' and he had stopped paying rent, hoping the owners didn't have the power to make him leave while the request was pending. He had a crumpled, tattered copy of a circular entitled 'Tenants' Rights', distributed by a free legal-services office in the neighbourhood. 'The hotel is not allowed to do anything to keep you from becoming a permanent tenant with full rights,' the advice said. 'The so-called 21-day agreements are not legal or enforceable.' One night, Raul came to the lobby carrying a handful of London broil steaks he had stolen from supermarkets that day. Raul said he was exhausted; he was sweating and he was high from the reefer he had just smoked to take the edge off the methadone. He said shoplifting was hard work - risky, tense. Raul was warm and quick to please, and he had the remnants of an easy charm. He said he had a strong leaning toward spirituality and philosophy. In college, he had written a long paper on the notion of cause and effect, and he said he thought about the question a lot. The narrator of Robert Pirsig's Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance had nearly lost his mind trying to fathom the great questions, he said, and he reminded Raul of himself. 'For everything that occurs,' he said, 'there's an antecedent cause. And I'm saying, \"How can I improve my life by creating better causes day to day?\" It comes down to taking responsibility for your life and realising that problems are an integral part of everyone's existence.'</p> <p>Raul had traced the beginnings of his troubles in many directions: his mother's mental illness, growing up without ever meeting his father, the crack plague of the 80s, a girlfriend's fatal overdose. He had been a crack addict in his twenties, nearly committing suicide in the trough of one of his deep depressions, and he had turned to heroin in his thirties; he used methadone now, with the occasional joint when he could get a couple of dollars together. Raul showed me his book of poetry, a thick black spiral binder with 166 worn and dog-eared pages. He had stopped writing when he became homeless. He had shown the collection to only a few friends: words were sacred things to him.</p> <p>On a Sunday morning in mid-October, the real-estate section of the New York Times carried a story about a businessman who had converted the derelict upper floors of a building on the Bowery into lofts. The economic boom in New York City in the 90s, which had gentrified poorer neighbourhoods in every borough, had passed the Bowery by until now. A local residents' association had started to complain about the bums on the avenue and pressure the government for the removal of one of the Bowery rescue missions. Buildings along the avenue had been neglected for generations, so the area was relatively cheap, and because it is also centrally located, multimillion-dollar conversions into lofts had begun, slowly, to transform the Bowery.</p> <p>The day after the Times story, Stevie came down the stairs of the hotel slowly, little more than five steps a minute. He looked as though he might fall at any moment. He was thin and dishevelled, his chest concave, his long blond hair stringy and greasy. His sharp blue eyes were bloodshot, his perfect white set of false teeth was missing, and his face had collapsed in on itself. Stevie said he was feeling bad, 'real bad'. He asked if he could borrow a dollar and he bought a caramel candy at the store next door.</p> <p>Stevie was a III, the third man in his family to carry his name. He said he had been raised in a wealthy Long Island village. His parents still lived in a big house, with eight or nine bedrooms, he said, and in his home town there were estates with private helicopter pads and $5 million mansions. Two days before, I had gone with Stevie as he stopped by one of the few soup kitchens still operating in lower Manhattan. Stevie said he was 37, although his sagging face and stooped manner made him appear many years older. He had been an auto mechanic, specialising in imports such as BMWs and Porsches. He said he had $10,000 worth of tools in the garage at his parents' house, along with a stash of methadone pills he was hoarding for the day he would wean himself off the drug by lessening his dose little by little.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/life/story/0,6903,348472,00.html\" target=\"_new\">Read the second part of Down and out in New York here</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "The Hotel Providence stands at the intersection of Grand Street and the Bowery in lower Manhattan, a nondescript five-story brick building diagonally across from the Romanesque columns of the long-defunct Bowery Savings Bank. To the west is the bustle of Little Italy and SoHo; to the east are Latino neighbourhoods and the bars and bistros of the gentrifying Lower East Side. The fa\u00e7ade of the Hotel Providence is chipped, the paint the colour of wan flesh, and the sign advertising its presence is small, inconspicuous in the riot of billboards and store fronts. Days on the Bowery, the streets of Chinatown surrounding the hotel are teeming with pedestrians; passers-by hurry along the pavement without a sideward glance. Nights, after the lighting-fixture and restaurant-supply stores have rolled down their metal sliding doors, the avenue is deserted, lit only by the thin yellow glow of street lights and of traffic slowly making its way downtown. The entrance to the Providence is wedged between a Chinese restaurant and a vegetable market. Inside, beyond the two or three men always loitering in the doorway, a single, steep flight of stairs leads up to a landing, where a clerk sits at the front desk behind a thick glass cage. To the left, there are steel doors that can be opened only by a security buzzer. No Visitor, the notices at the front desk say, Rent Must Be Paid in 24 Hours Or Room Will Be Emptied, Starting Now People Throwing Something Out The Window Will Be Kicked Out. Rooms at the Providence are let to men only; the price is $10 a night, payment in cash, in advance. Like the few other flophouses still left on America's legendary skid row - the World, the Grand, the Sunshine, the White House, the Prince - the Providence is a remnant from a time when dozens of Bowery hotels offered refuge, of a kind, for a man in need of shelter and alone in the world. In the early 20th century, when bars and hotels lined the street, some 25,000 men lived on the Bowery. Now, the best estimate is that 6,000 men in New York City are without shelter every night, but there are rooms for only 1,500 on the avenue. There is rarely a vacancy at the Providence; the place has 224 boxes crammed into four small floors, and every night the joint is packed. Bowery flophouses have long offered men a convenient location, with few questions asked and the freedom to come and go. The alternatives are few. In the run-down quarter of Far Rockaway, Queens - 21 rail miles, 57 minutes, and a $1.50 subway fare away from the soup kitchens, social services offices, and methadone clinics of Manhattan - there are a growing number of homes illegally operating as boarding houses. And in poorer neighbourhoods throughout New York City's five boroughs, there are furnished basements and spare rooms, rentable on a weekly basis, a trade that is generally under the table and unregulated. After those options, which both usually require a security deposit and as much as a month's rent up front, the choices narrow and harden: a free cot in a city-run shelter, with wide open rooms and military camp-like rules, and rampant crime; a bed in one of the few church-run missions that continue to operate in lower Manhattan, with the religious services and demands of sobriety; or finally, living rough on the street. Very late one night at the beginning of October 1999, I walked up the stairs of the Hotel Providence. There was a vacancy, so I paid the $10, plus a $5 key deposit, intending to report on a month in the lives of the men and the hotel. For decades, the Providence had been one of a string of Bowery flophouses owned by the same corporation, but recently they had brought in new management. The new operators are Chinese and their sides of conversations about paying rent, trying to pick up mail, and complaints were shouted across the front desk in fractured English. On the second floor of the hotel, at the far side of the security door, a short dark corridor opened into a large room with high, echoing ceilings and scattered tables and chairs. The lobby was littered with full ashtrays and sleeping cats, and half-dressed men drifted in and out; here was the only gathering place in the hotel, the only place to sit out of the weather, eat, have a few beers, watch Wheel of Fortune on the old television propped in a corner. The marble floor was cracked and riven with grime, the air thick with the smells of men left to their own devices. The windows were stained brown by generations of cigarette smoke and soot; it was impossible to see into the hotel from the street, impossible to see out from the lobby. At night, before the alcohol and drugs had taken hold, the talk in the lobby was muted and friendly: 'How'd you eat today?' 'Got an extra smoke?' 'Burger King has a special, a Whopper for 99 cents, a buck seven with tax.' The roach-ends of joints were passed around and tips about horse races and soup kitchens were exchanged - the closest thing the men had to society - until, at 9.30 or so, a few of the regulars went down to the street to bring up boxes filled with sandwiches, oranges and cartons of milk donated by the Coalition for the Homeless, and the food was set upon, wolf like. The men went by first names, nicknames, jail names, aliases: the point of staying in the hotel was to be left alone, to hide from the law, family, creditors, the past, oneself - and the men I met agreed to let me write about them on the condition that I didn't reveal their real identities. Many had become permanent residents of the Providence, some having lived there for decades, and they had gained the legal rights of tenants under New York law: their rent raises were controlled by the city in accordance with the rate at the time the man first moved in. Some men were still paying as little as $4 or $5 a night and, in theory at least, they had recourse to the courts and police to ensure that they are not evicted. New arrivals, classified as temporary residents, faced a rule that wasn't posted but that was universal on the Bowery and strictly applied: the most time that the managers permitted a newcomer to stay was 21 nights in a row. The days each new arrival spent in the Providence were carefully marked in the ledger book, and at the end of 21 days, he was required to leave the hotel for a night or two before he was allowed to return. The hotel lobby, the point of return at dark, filled with men as the sun set and the coming winter began to chill the nights. The men were mostly white and Hispanic. The permanent residents and regulars, like Raul, were in their late thirties and forties and older, although many looked years and even decades beyond their years. Stevie, a gaunt methadone junkie, his complexion deathly pale, sat at a table and drank a bottle of Wild Irish Rose; Turk, dressed in shorts and a canvas sun hat, shared the leftover won ton and tofu he collected from a Chinese restaurant across the street. In one corner, a man silently played scales on his portable Casino electric piano, the headphones askew, his face expressionless. Another man, who couldn't muster the price of a room but was allowed to spend his evenings in the lobby, tried to sell anything he had come across in his wanderings that might have value: Bic razors, a broken watch, a snowsuit. The transients were younger, in their twenties and thirties; new men turned up in the lobby on most nights. The Providence was originally built in the 1880s as a place for sailors to sleep off their shore-leave drinks. At the time, places like the Providence were known as 'cage hotels' - then, as now, the 'rooms' weren't, in any real sense, rooms at all: most were cubicles measuring 3.5ft wide, 6ft long and 8ft high. The walls were flimsy wooden partitions; there were no windows in most rooms, and chicken wire was strung over the top in place of a ceiling. Among the varieties of shelter once available on the Bowery - 'barrel houses', which provided a place to sit out of the rain in exchange for the purchase of keg beer; 'rope houses', with ropes strung across the room for men to lean against as they tried to sleep standing up; 'flophouses', often amounting to nothing more than a roof overhead and a space on the floor of an open room - the cage hotels, with a private 'room' and chicken-wire ceilings, were relatively upmarket; they have become what are now known generically as flophouses.

My room was on the fourth floor, near Stevie's. Whenever I opened the door, I was met by a waft of rank, dead air. Inside, a rickety metal-frame cot with a piece of plywood under a wafer-thin mattress and covered by a single torn sheet pocked with cigarette burns; pillows and blanket weren't provided. The room was painted in two tones, dull green and dull red, and there was one exposed light bulb and one hook and Spanish graffiti scratched on the wall next to a faded poster of an Indian chief and a note taped in a corner that said, 'Just a reminder_ to keep trying.' The bathroom was at the far end of the floor, four toilet stalls for more than 60 men, the tiling cracked and filthy and marked with scrawlings saying Flush Don't Be A Pig, and threats and counter-threats, claims and counterclaims that someone was a Homo who Takes It Up The Ass. In the dead of night, the man in the next room moaned in his sleep, his low cries joining the chorus of hacking coughs and wheezes and the deep, guttural rasp of throat-cleared phlegm sounding throughout the hotel. Roaches crawled across the floor and walls, and small, airborne, biting midges lit on the sheets. Some men tried to control these plagues with sprays and chemical bombs, but most just learned to live with them. That first night I didn't sleep at all. Mornings came early at the Providence, stirrings beginning just after dawn, voices calling out, televisions turned on, radios tuned to Howard Stern and salsa and all-news stations. Sleepout Jackie, a long-time resident, lived a few doors away on the fourth floor. Sleepout ran a kind of restaurant from his room - a 'chuck wagon', he called it - and he sold heros and meatball sandwiches for a dollar each. Sleepout said he had been attacked with a machete once, and he stayed clear of the lobby at night because there were too many fights. Stevie, the methadone junkie who lived one hallway over, had battled with Sleepout, and Sleepout had thrown buckets of cold water through the chicken wire of Stevie's room.

The stench was close and tangible, the temper lawless. Detective Robert Sushinsky from the Fifth Precinct, who regularly checked the hotel's register for men with outstanding warrants, and who was often called to the hotel to collect the corpse of an alcoholic or junkie who had died in his sleep, told me the police wouldn't send undercover cops into the hotel because most of the men there had done time in jail and they could smell anyone who didn't belong there. It was too dangerous, he said, not worth risking an officer's life. In mid-October the new management of the Providence began to renovate the premises.

      "body": "<p>Most visitors to London collect snapshots of Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament. Effie Paleologou prefers anonymous streets and deserted stations (see picture, right). But then Paleologou is no ordinary visitor. She graduated from the Royal College of Art in 1997 after arriving in Britain from Greece just six years earlier, and her large-scale photographic images of the city by night have the suffused feel of an Edward Hopper painting. </p> <p>A late-starter in the art world, Paleologou draws her influences primarily from literature. She cites Kafka and Baudelaire as points of reference in the two images of London by night that she is showing as part of the Made in London group exhibition at Zelda Cheatle Gallery.

      "bodyText": "Most visitors to London collect snapshots of Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament. Effie Paleologou prefers anonymous streets and deserted stations (see picture, right). But then Paleologou is no ordinary visitor. She graduated from the Royal College of Art in 1997 after arriving in Britain from Greece just six years earlier, and her large-scale photographic images of the city by night have the suffused feel of an Edward Hopper painting. A late-starter in the art world, Paleologou draws her influences primarily from literature. She cites Kafka and Baudelaire as points of reference in the two images of London by night that she is showing as part of the Made in London group exhibition at Zelda Cheatle Gallery.

      "body": "<p>You'll have to go to the cinema if you want to see the latest mutation of the male rebel fantasy. The movie in question isn't a remake of The Wild Bunch, Easy Rider, or even West Side Story. The props aren't motorbikes, guns or knives. The movie is High Fidelity, directed by Stephen Frears, adapted from the Nick Hornby novel, and starring John Cusack as an emotionally stagnant music-obsessed sweetie. A case of rare vinyl at dawn, and a few pick 'n' mix muso nerds. Still, the stench of male rebellion is in the air as Cusack sits among his records and tussles with age- old quandaries: to commit or not to commit? To alphabeticise, or not to alphabeticise? Those are the questions. And while it's not exactly Peter Fonda screeching off in a blur of tyres and testosterone, something tells me that it's the best your modern rebel can do. </p> <p>What is modern man rebelling against? What have we got? As women, the answer is very little. It seems to me that modern women let men do pretty much what they want - go to the football, drink themselves blind, play records until their ears bleed, forget to marry them. Yet women are still lumbered with the reputation as the gender that fun forgot. Ask any man, and their story is that we don't really like it when they go to the football, we're secretly unamused when they play their records, we covertly roll our eyes when they get drunk. This tolerance thing is all a big act, and once we get our claws into them properly, that's it - the end of the world as they know it. </p> <p>Hornby's more popular novels are a case in point, working on the rather spurious premise that male maturity is all about giving up your passions (football, music) and settling down with a wonderful woman, who would then obviously do everything in her power to stop you enjoying yourself. </p> <p>In all fairness, High Fidelity is great fun, and Hornby's male protagonists are always clearly defined as self-centred architects of their own misery. Still, is it any coincidence that, in wider culture, female characters routinely signify the end of pleasure rather than the beginning? Whether it be in movies, novels, soaps or sitcoms, it seems that women are cast as the killjoy sex, on a mission to part men from their small pleasures. Men, in turn, are seen to be heroically stubborn about hanging on to them. </p> <p>The message rings out loud and clear: however much a man might love a woman, he owes it to his fellow urban outlaws not to let her stamp out the small fire that is him and his Gram Parsons boxed set and Arsenal football rattle. She's just going to have to accept his gigantic record collection. She's just going to have to put up with him attending away games. She's just going to have to wait until the right Bob Dylan lyric (live bootleg version, side two, track four), makes him feel he's ready to make a commitment. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, women are sick of this sulking and posturing, not to mention all the cheap denim. The truth is, we don't mind men who are into 'stuff'. If anything, we prefer them - figuring that men who have amusements and passions have a better than average chance of being amusing and passionate. Women don't even seem to want to pester men into marriage any more. The most recent NOP survey about 'Bachelor Girls' says that women are putting off commitment in favour of the single life, with twice as many women as men claiming that they don't want to get married at all. So, there we go - a whole generation of men let off the hook, with no one to yell at them, sneer at them, never mind want to marry them. Maybe that's the problem. </p> <p>It seems to me that men enjoy their maverick outlaw fantasies and nothing - not your complete acceptance, your support, even your outright enjoyment of their quirks and foibles - is going to stop them living them out. It's a case of: 'I like football/records/getting drunk, and you're not going to stop me.' The point is, modern woman is no longer interested in trying to stop modern man from doing anything. She's too busy making sure he doesn't try to stop her. </p> <p>So it is that in High Fidelity , Cusack's obsessive record collecting and list making is seen as a metaphor for his immaturity and perversity, but only by the man himself. Like so many of his generation, his embarrassment and sense of rebellion are all in the mind. Women are either oblivious to all these tormented wranglings, or they find them quite charming. They certainly aren't going to waste their energy trying to get some commitment-shy bozo to marry them. That's so last century, darling. And yet, crazed by arrogance, men still keep on running, and keep on writing novels and screenplays about how they keep on running.

Nasty.</p> <p>The father of the host, and a more peaceable man you could not hope to meet, looked ready to chin his first three-year-old while the mother, some might say feebly, tried to cajole the assailant into saying 'sorry' to his victim, who was lying in his mother's arms while his father inspected him for signs of cranial damage. The rest of us, with great rapidity, made our excuses and left.</p> <p>Since then, The Kid has been busy assembling a reputation for random acts of extreme violence which make his party turn look the work of an amateur. Which is tough on all those people who are too polite not to exclude The Kid from their social whirl. Tough, too, on The Kid's parents.</p> <p>Every way you cut it, their cake looks bleak. Is The Kid the way he is because of genetics, which doesn't do a whole bundle for your self-esteem; or conditioning, which in these days of full-on parenting is possibly worse? Grim as it may be for the parents whose progeny come into contact, usually violent, with The Kid, it is grimmer still for the parents of The Kid. They can't hit their own child; they can't be seen to be bribing someone else's child to hit their child; they are desperately and secretly hoping that another parent loses his cool and hits The Kid for them.

Twenty minutes later he went one better, creating something of a side show during a game of musical statues by tripping a co-competitor and as he lay on the ground, kicking him twice, very hard, in the head. Nasty. The father of the host, and a more peaceable man you could not hope to meet, looked ready to chin his first three-year-old while the mother, some might say feebly, tried to cajole the assailant into saying 'sorry' to his victim, who was lying in his mother's arms while his father inspected him for signs of cranial damage. The rest of us, with great rapidity, made our excuses and left. Since then, The Kid has been busy assembling a reputation for random acts of extreme violence which make his party turn look the work of an amateur. Which is tough on all those people who are too polite not to exclude The Kid from their social whirl. Tough, too, on The Kid's parents. Every way you cut it, their cake looks bleak. Is The Kid the way he is because of genetics, which doesn't do a whole bundle for your self-esteem; or conditioning, which in these days of full-on parenting is possibly worse? Grim as it may be for the parents whose progeny come into contact, usually violent, with The Kid, it is grimmer still for the parents of The Kid. They can't hit their own child; they can't be seen to be bribing someone else's child to hit their child; they are desperately and secretly hoping that another parent loses his cool and hits The Kid for them. And then they can get all huffy about it. will.buckley@observer.co.uk",
