      "bodyText": "William Hague was last night condemned as an \"irresponsible rabble rouser\" by the Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, as the war of words intensified between the two parties over Tory hardline interventions on asylum and law and order. Mr Kennedy, who believes the distance he put between his party and the Conservatives helped the Lib Dems gain a surprise byelection victory in Romsey earlier this month, claimed that, by pursuing \"kneejerk\" solutions to complex problems, Mr Hague was \"devaluing political life in Britain\". Delivering the Isaiah Berlin lecture at the National Liberal Club in London, Mr Kennedy dubbed the Tory leader \"Sheriff Hague - the apologist for vigilantes - shooting from the hip and asking questions later\". His assault on Mr Hague's record took in the Tory leader's tax guarantee, his support for tougher sentencing, his backing for householders using violence against intruders and his tough stance on asylum-seekers. Liberal Democrat strategists believe the uncompromising criticism will not only demonstrate clear distance between the party and the Conservatives, but will also differentiate the Lib Dems from Labour. They argue Tony Blair's government has entered into a Dutch auction with the Tories on law and order issues, and believe they can position themselves as the clearest alternative for voters turned off by Mr Hague's stance. The Conservatives, also confident they are on a winning streak after gaining almost 600 local council seats, dismissed Mr Kennedy as \"Downing Street's lapdog\". The Lib Dem leader, who has now set his sights on taking a further 50 - mainly Conservative - seats at the next election in the wake of his party's Romsey success, insisted that Mr Hague was not fit to be leader of the opposition, let alone prime minister. Attacking the Tory leader's policies on asylum and crime, he said: \"By stirring up base instincts against asylum seekers and by seeking to change the law by kneejerk reaction, Mr Hague is devaluing political life in Britain. \"Issues like asylum and the trial of criminals are difficult. They have no easy answers. They require calm reflection, and it is shameful behaviour to pretend otherwise. \"Today's Conservative party is led by an irresponsible rabble rouser. A potential prime minister should never pander to prejudice nor cover up his record nor propose policies he rejected in government. \"But William Hague is no future prime minister - indeed he is not even fit to lead the opposition. People are sick of his glib soundbites and rhetorical gestures on crime.\" Mr Kennedy also described Mr Hague's claim that low taxation was in itself morally good as \"laughable\". Turning his fire on the government, he said that Labour had a \"strong authoritarian streak\" and accused it of being \"increasingly unable to recognise pluralism\", as shown in the elections in Wales and London. A Conservative party spokesman said: \"Charles Kennedy is no potential prime minister. It is hard to take him seriously in his laughable role as a Downing Street lapdog.\"",

Deutsche Telekom - or rather its stakeholder KfW - said yesterday that it would sell off some 200m shares in the telecoms group.

But, for those which now need to go back to investors made more wary by recent events, further financing may be difficult. </p> <p>That may be no bad thing in general terms but it would be unfortunate if viable ventures were to fail because they were unable to secure financing as a result of their sector falling out of favour.</p> <p><strong> Merger snags </strong> </p> <p>The members of the Deutsche B\u00f6rse's supervisory board are between a rock and a hard place. Given the level of disquiet already expressed, not least within their own ranks, nodding the deal through will seem at best indifferent towards the worries which have surfaced about the future of Frankfurt as a finanzplatz in the wake of the merger. </p> <p>But if they reverse their earlier stance and vote the deal down they will leave both London and Frankfurt with very large holes in their respective strategies. Even saying \"yes, but\" risks undermining the deal. The LSE is going to have a tough enough time persuading its members to back the merger without having to battle against the perception that its partner is an unwilling one. </p> <p>To an extent they and the architects of the deal have only themselves to blame - though they are entitled to feel frustrated, too, that critics in both centres are claiming their exchange will lose out to the other. One set, after all, must be wrong. </p> <p>The plan was put together in haste. Though it addressed the crucial issue of pan European trading - a facility on which many in both London and Frankfurt are keen - it left much undone. And while it is clear the two exchanges want to bring in others - Milan and Madrid to name but two - how that will be done is not. Nor has enough been done to address the concerns of those facing additional costs or who fear being marginalised but for whom the ability to deal easily and efficiently across European borders is not a central fact of daily commercial life. </p> <p>Perhaps the strongest argument Deutsche B\u00f6rse chief executive Werner Seifert will deploy will be the alternatives to acceptance. If the deal is voted down Frankfurt risks being isolated. London might be able to switch its attentions to Euronext - the alliance of Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels. Certainly Euronext would be keen enough. </p> <p>The history of relations between Frankfurt and Paris, however, makes that option look unlikely for the German exchange. It could go it alone but that is risky. The London alliance will cement the position of Frankfurt's Xetra as Europe's leading trading system but it is unlikely to achieve that standing if the b\u00f6rse is forced to fly solo. </p> <p>On balance the least worst option is for the board to back its executive this evening. That would allow both exchanges a breathing space during which they could do rather more thinking about the project than appears to have been the case to date and, equally importantly, work very hard at addressing the concerns of their members - and then do something about them.</p>",

That may be no bad thing in general terms but it would be unfortunate if viable ventures were to fail because they were unable to secure financing as a result of their sector falling out of favour. Merger snags The members of the Deutsche B\u00f6rse's supervisory board are between a rock and a hard place. Given the level of disquiet already expressed, not least within their own ranks, nodding the deal through will seem at best indifferent towards the worries which have surfaced about the future of Frankfurt as a finanzplatz in the wake of the merger. But if they reverse their earlier stance and vote the deal down they will leave both London and Frankfurt with very large holes in their respective strategies. Even saying \"yes, but\" risks undermining the deal. The LSE is going to have a tough enough time persuading its members to back the merger without having to battle against the perception that its partner is an unwilling one. To an extent they and the architects of the deal have only themselves to blame - though they are entitled to feel frustrated, too, that critics in both centres are claiming their exchange will lose out to the other. One set, after all, must be wrong. The plan was put together in haste. Though it addressed the crucial issue of pan European trading - a facility on which many in both London and Frankfurt are keen - it left much undone. And while it is clear the two exchanges want to bring in others - Milan and Madrid to name but two - how that will be done is not. Nor has enough been done to address the concerns of those facing additional costs or who fear being marginalised but for whom the ability to deal easily and efficiently across European borders is not a central fact of daily commercial life. Perhaps the strongest argument Deutsche B\u00f6rse chief executive Werner Seifert will deploy will be the alternatives to acceptance. If the deal is voted down Frankfurt risks being isolated. London might be able to switch its attentions to Euronext - the alliance of Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels. Certainly Euronext would be keen enough. The history of relations between Frankfurt and Paris, however, makes that option look unlikely for the German exchange. It could go it alone but that is risky. The London alliance will cement the position of Frankfurt's Xetra as Europe's leading trading system but it is unlikely to achieve that standing if the b\u00f6rse is forced to fly solo. On balance the least worst option is for the board to back its executive this evening. That would allow both exchanges a breathing space during which they could do rather more thinking about the project than appears to have been the case to date and, equally importantly, work very hard at addressing the concerns of their members - and then do something about them.",

And it's this heart-warming attitude to the kids that shifts thousands of T-shirts and sells millions of albums around the world. In America, Korn's first two albums - the self-titled Korn and Life is Peachy - went platinum with no radio airplay or MTV backing. </p> <p>In Britain they've built a young and devoted following of teenagers whose parents don't understand them. It's an atmosphere of expectation and complete deference that fills Wembley Arena. Life sucks - but there's always singer Jonathan Davis and his screeching tales of child abuse and pleas to be left alone to get you through the odd bad day at school.

      "bodyText": "Some bands keep their fans at a safe distance. Korn keep them in a cage on stage. And it's this heart-warming attitude to the kids that shifts thousands of T-shirts and sells millions of albums around the world. In America, Korn's first two albums - the self-titled Korn and Life is Peachy - went platinum with no radio airplay or MTV backing. In Britain they've built a young and devoted following of teenagers whose parents don't understand them. It's an atmosphere of expectation and complete deference that fills Wembley Arena. Life sucks - but there's always singer Jonathan Davis and his screeching tales of child abuse and pleas to be left alone to get you through the odd bad day at school. Like Korn's new, fourth album says, it's all about the Issues, man. Davis, dressed like Rasputin, voice full of rage, stands centre-stage surveying the crowd furiously throwing themselves at his feet as the band wring the life out of Good God.

      "body": "<p>Runs may have been as thick on the ground in the National League this season as bons mots from Paul Gascoigne but two of the promoted clubs made amends with a vengeance here yesterday. </p> <p>Better still, Graeme Swann and Marcus Trescothick emphasised their claims for England one-day contracts with batting to warm the most resistant cockles. </p> <p>On a day when the visitors' long-leg Darren Cousins cost his side a couple of runs with an impromptu visit to the loo, Somerset made short work of a daunting target thanks to an unbroken seventh-wicket stand of 85 in 11 overs between Keith Parsons and Ian Blackwell, achieving their second success in two 45-over games with 17 balls to spare. </p> <p>Northamptonshire, meanwhile, have still to get off the mark. Their innings, the highest of the National League season to date, leant on two muscular partnerships: 59 in 11 overs for the third wicket by Matthew Hayden and David Sales, 88 in 14 for the sixth by Swann and David Ripley. </p> <p>Coming as it did after Sales, Hayden and Jeff Cook had all exited inside seven overs in a blaze of needless smears, the last alliance was as vital as it was stirring. </p> <p>Slim and enviably self- assured, Swann is noted for neither false modesty nor punctuality. Oversleeping once on a maiden senior tour as he did in South Africa might be considered careless; to do so twice smacked of wonky focus at best, hence the resultant fine. </p> <p>The likeliest path to restitution lies less with those unfashionable off-breaks - his four overs here cost 29 - than that supple bat. Setting off with a deceptively delicate nudge for four, Swann was soon taking the aerial route, the swing nonchalant, the timing sublime. </p> <p>Racing to 50 off 35 balls with nine fours, he fell two overs later, missing a Trescothick long-hop, but the means will surely outlive the end. </p> <p>The same could be said of Trescothick. Giving Somerset a flyer with a pair of fours in Devon Malcolm's opening over, this strapping opener survived the early loss of Jamie Cox and faltered thereafter only when Piran Holloway, responding to his call, was run out from short midwicket as the hefty Hayden swooped with the grace of a prima ballerina. </p> <p>Dismissing good-length balls as if piqued by such temerity, Trescothick drove with effortless yet ferocious power. One Malcolm over brought him 14, including an imperious hooked six that would have turned Ian Botham green. </p> <p>Memories of what might have been were kindled by a brief liaison with Mark Lathwell, warmly applauded to the middle for his first significant knock here since missing last season with a knee complaint, but after making 68 off 80 balls Trescothick flicked Michael Davies to midwicket and departed with a livid swish of that mighty blade.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Runs may have been as thick on the ground in the National League this season as bons mots from Paul Gascoigne but two of the promoted clubs made amends with a vengeance here yesterday. Better still, Graeme Swann and Marcus Trescothick emphasised their claims for England one-day contracts with batting to warm the most resistant cockles. On a day when the visitors' long-leg Darren Cousins cost his side a couple of runs with an impromptu visit to the loo, Somerset made short work of a daunting target thanks to an unbroken seventh-wicket stand of 85 in 11 overs between Keith Parsons and Ian Blackwell, achieving their second success in two 45-over games with 17 balls to spare. Northamptonshire, meanwhile, have still to get off the mark. Their innings, the highest of the National League season to date, leant on two muscular partnerships: 59 in 11 overs for the third wicket by Matthew Hayden and David Sales, 88 in 14 for the sixth by Swann and David Ripley. Coming as it did after Sales, Hayden and Jeff Cook had all exited inside seven overs in a blaze of needless smears, the last alliance was as vital as it was stirring. Slim and enviably self- assured, Swann is noted for neither false modesty nor punctuality. Oversleeping once on a maiden senior tour as he did in South Africa might be considered careless; to do so twice smacked of wonky focus at best, hence the resultant fine. The likeliest path to restitution lies less with those unfashionable off-breaks - his four overs here cost 29 - than that supple bat. Setting off with a deceptively delicate nudge for four, Swann was soon taking the aerial route, the swing nonchalant, the timing sublime. Racing to 50 off 35 balls with nine fours, he fell two overs later, missing a Trescothick long-hop, but the means will surely outlive the end. The same could be said of Trescothick. Giving Somerset a flyer with a pair of fours in Devon Malcolm's opening over, this strapping opener survived the early loss of Jamie Cox and faltered thereafter only when Piran Holloway, responding to his call, was run out from short midwicket as the hefty Hayden swooped with the grace of a prima ballerina. Dismissing good-length balls as if piqued by such temerity, Trescothick drove with effortless yet ferocious power. One Malcolm over brought him 14, including an imperious hooked six that would have turned Ian Botham green. Memories of what might have been were kindled by a brief liaison with Mark Lathwell, warmly applauded to the middle for his first significant knock here since missing last season with a knee complaint, but after making 68 off 80 balls Trescothick flicked Michael Davies to midwicket and departed with a livid swish of that mighty blade.",

Stringent restrictions will apply not only to players but to all involved in the first-class game, including umpires, groundsmen and committee members. David Graveney, chief executive of the Professional Cricketers' Association, is drawing up the code in partnership with Gerard Elias QC, chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board's disciplinary committee. \"We need a clear and easy-to-understand code which makes the responsibilities of players and employees entirely plain,\" he said. \"One suggestion is a total ban on cricket betting, under any circumstances, for all those involved within the game. The game must not just be clean but be seen to be clean.\" Graveney presented a damning paper nine months ago on the development in Britain of spread betting, which enables wagers to be struck not only on the result of a match but on isolated incidents within the game. \"Many of my fears about spread betting have already come true,\" he said. It is spread betting in Asia which is being held chiefly responsible for the spread of match-rigging, organised by mafia-like betting rings, in international cricket. The International Cricket Council will also face pressure today to launch an urgent investigation into fresh allegations that one of its own officials has acted as an intermediary between illegal bookmakers and players allegedly involved in match-fixing. A national Sunday newspaper has offered the ICC videotapes of what it claims is an undercover sting against the former Pakistan batsman Salim Malik, in which Malik allegedly claims that an ICC official is on his match-fixers' payroll. The taped meetings with Malik are said to have taken place in the Kensington Hilton hotel late last month, a few days before the emergency ICC meeting at Lord's into cricket corruption decided upon a series of stiff punishments for players or officials involved in any betting conspiracy. Malik is one of the central figures in the Justice Qayyum match-fixing investigation, the findings of which the ICC has demanded are released by Pakistan well in advance of its next meeting at Lord's, on June 20. Persistent leaks suggest that Qayyum has recommended that Malik be banned for life. With the energies of the ICC's president Jagmohan Dalmiya entirely taken up by protecting his own reputation against charges of corruption, the onus will be on the chief executive David Richards, who has been absent from his desk for the past fortnight, to respond to the newspaper's charges. Tim Lamb, chief executive of the ECB, responded: \"If there is fresh evidence then we will welcome this being cleared up as soon as possible. \"But the ICC have still to appoint their head of the anti-corruption commission, and you can't have a trial without a judge.\"",

But in today's market that costs the sort of money Chelsea balked at when linked with the \u00a319m Ruud van Nistelrooy. It is the same weakness which undermines recent speculation that Chelsea will sign the Lazio striker Marcelo Salas, valued at \u00a313m.</p> <p>And then Chelsea have the problem of luring players without the bait of Champions League football.</p> <p>The likelihood is that Vialli will trim his squad rather than butcher it. Fringe players such as Jes Hogh, Bernard Lambourde and Gabriele Ambrosetti are likely to leave, plus Weah and Sutton, if they can get \u00a34m for him.

Petrescu, for example, sitting on a juicy contract signed in January, has little incentive to agree to leave for what would almost certainly be a lesser club. Di Matteo, Deschamps, Leboeuf, Zola: all are in similar positions. And prospective purchasers may find ageing players on huge salaries less than tempting. On the other side of the equation, to improve his squad Vialli must buy better players than these. But in today's market that costs the sort of money Chelsea balked at when linked with the \u00a319m Ruud van Nistelrooy. It is the same weakness which undermines recent speculation that Chelsea will sign the Lazio striker Marcelo Salas, valued at \u00a313m. And then Chelsea have the problem of luring players without the bait of Champions League football. The likelihood is that Vialli will trim his squad rather than butcher it. Fringe players such as Jes Hogh, Bernard Lambourde and Gabriele Ambrosetti are likely to leave, plus Weah and Sutton, if they can get \u00a34m for him. In will come a new striker, perhaps Bolton's \u00a35m-rated Eidur Gudjohnsen, and a couple of other low-to-middle-range signings. In the end Chelsea cannot hope to compete with Manchester United for the title and play in the Uefa Cup if they cut their squad too brutally. As Dennis Wise said: \"We played 61 games this season and it took a toll on us. That's why you need a big squad like Man United. You've got to be able to do it like them.\"",

      "body": "<p>One person left cold, not warmed, by the image of Dennis Wise the cuddly daddy on Saturday was Aston Villa's George Boateng, who has accused the Chelsea captain of trying to injure him and get him sent off . </p> <p>\"I still have marks on me because there were so many challenges from Wise the referee didn't see,\" said the robust midfielder. \"I play my football hard but I play it fair. I don't play to injure anybody or get them sent off.</p> <p>\"Wise literally tried to walk over my face while I was on the ground. Another time I walked away from Wise and he tried to flick my heels but I saw him coming. He was talking at me all the way through.</p> <p>\"I wouldn't shake [Marcel] Desailly's hand afterwards. I played the ball but he stepped on my feet once it had gone.</p> <p>Wise, who was booked for a challenge on Boateng, responded succinctly: \"He caught me at least three times but I'm not complaining or moaning. He's a cry baby.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile Paul Merson says he is \"90% certain\" to leave Villa, though the club's Italian striker Benito Carbone is likely to stay.</p> <p>Merson, 32, wants to extend his contract so that he can finish his career in the top flight with Villa at the age of 35. \"I've offered to take a pay cut to stay, as well,\" he said. But he added: \"I've had very negative feedback. I've got to see the boss [John Gregory] in the next couple of days but, if I want to stay at the top until I'm 35, I don't think I'll be doing it here.\"</p> <p>With the Belgian internaional Luc Nilis, who like Merson is a forward, due to arrive in the summer from PSV Eindhoven, Villa may have decided to cash in on the former England player after an impressive season. Merson joined Villa from Middlesbrough for \u00a36.75m early in the 1998/99 season.</p> <p>Carbone is more confident of extending the short-term contract on which he has been playing since joining from Sheffield Wednesday.</p> <p>\"The club and I will talk this week,\" said the Italian, reported to be looking for \u00a330,000 a week. \"But I think it will be positive news because the club and the manager want me to stay and I want to stay. I think we can close the contract quickly.\"</p> <p>If Carbone moves to any other club this summer it will be a Bosman transfer with no fee.

      "bodyText": "One person left cold, not warmed, by the image of Dennis Wise the cuddly daddy on Saturday was Aston Villa's George Boateng, who has accused the Chelsea captain of trying to injure him and get him sent off . \"I still have marks on me because there were so many challenges from Wise the referee didn't see,\" said the robust midfielder. \"I play my football hard but I play it fair. I don't play to injure anybody or get them sent off. \"Wise literally tried to walk over my face while I was on the ground. Another time I walked away from Wise and he tried to flick my heels but I saw him coming. He was talking at me all the way through. \"I wouldn't shake [Marcel] Desailly's hand afterwards. I played the ball but he stepped on my feet once it had gone. Wise, who was booked for a challenge on Boateng, responded succinctly: \"He caught me at least three times but I'm not complaining or moaning. He's a cry baby.\" Meanwhile Paul Merson says he is \"90% certain\" to leave Villa, though the club's Italian striker Benito Carbone is likely to stay. Merson, 32, wants to extend his contract so that he can finish his career in the top flight with Villa at the age of 35. \"I've offered to take a pay cut to stay, as well,\" he said. But he added: \"I've had very negative feedback. I've got to see the boss [John Gregory] in the next couple of days but, if I want to stay at the top until I'm 35, I don't think I'll be doing it here.\" With the Belgian internaional Luc Nilis, who like Merson is a forward, due to arrive in the summer from PSV Eindhoven, Villa may have decided to cash in on the former England player after an impressive season. Merson joined Villa from Middlesbrough for \u00a36.75m early in the 1998/99 season. Carbone is more confident of extending the short-term contract on which he has been playing since joining from Sheffield Wednesday. \"The club and I will talk this week,\" said the Italian, reported to be looking for \u00a330,000 a week. \"But I think it will be positive news because the club and the manager want me to stay and I want to stay. I think we can close the contract quickly.\" If Carbone moves to any other club this summer it will be a Bosman transfer with no fee. But, because of the deal struck with Wednesday, if he signs permanently for Villa he will cost \u00a31m, of which \u00a3250,000 has been paid. Merson believes Villa still need a few more signings to become a major force. In what could be viewed as a farewell swipe he said: \"Villa need to spend a lot of money. I think you're looking at three or four players. When I think who from our team would get in the top four sides, there are not many, including me. \"The class gap was evident last week against Manchester United and it showed again against Chelsea in the second half. The distance is massive at the moment.\"",

No doubt there is violence - when you get that number of people together and have drink involved there are obviously at times going to be situations of conflict.

Bob Senior, managing director of a Newcastle company which owns a string of bars and nightspots on Tyneside, says cheap drink cannot be defended. His cocktail prices are more than double some cut-price outlets. \"It gets dangerous when some operators sell discounted drink on Fridays and Saturdays.

Almost 40% of men, and a quarter of women aged 16 to 24 now regularly drink more than eight and six units of alcohol respectively in one sitting (a unit is equal to a bottle of beer, or a glass of wine). Problem drinking is rising fastest among affluent young women. Leanne, a young Newcastle barmaid, said: \"Cheap booze is definitely making things worse.

The warm glow that investors felt as they watched their internet and technology shares soar in February and March has given way to horror as valuations have plummeted. Even good quality shares with real earnings rather than deepening losses have been hit by the change in sentiment. The technology, media and telecoms (TMT) sector is not just focused on e-tailers, but each new announcement that a dot.com company is struggling has a knock-on effect on new economy shares in general. After a report last week suggesting that many ecommerce companies were burning cash so quickly that they would run out of money within six months, there was more bad news today with the release of a report claiming that Britons had shown less interest than forecast in buying online. The problem for the dot.com companies, particularly those which are selling to the consumer rather than business, is the high cost of building a brand in a short timescale. The marketing costs are huge, and many ecommerce sites do not expect to make money for four or more years. Until now, this had not been a problem, as investors and venture capitalists were willing to tolerate large initial losses in the hope of owning a part of a new company which would one day dominate online retailing. But the fall in the price of technology shares and fears about how much profit the e-tailers can hope to make means the City is becoming much more cautious about providing more money when the first batch of funding runs out. There will be more e-casualties, and some will fail not because they are failing to stick to their business plan or meet their targets, but simply because venture capitalists are becoming far more selective about where they spend their money, and the City has lost its appetite for providing loss-making companies with second-round funding. Coupled with the continuing gyrations in the Nasdaq, the technology index in the US, there is likely to be more pain ahead for TMT investors.",

Mr Pugh said: \"If they could spend the money on sports facilities and such things it would be far better spent than pouring money into this. The general public isn't responding. If you take away the children there wouldn't be any people at all.\" But teacher Ian MacKenzie, who brought pupils from Colneis Junior School in Felixstowe, said: \"I think it should get more money. It is educational. It's given the children a chance to see things put to them in a more interesting way. Because they have spent so much money now I think it has got to be built up on a more permanent basis.\"",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p> <b>grover: </b> What qualifies you to answer these questions about Bloody Sunday? Were you there? Do you have access to \"privileged\" information or is your controversial position a personal interpretation of existing facts? </p> <p> <b>Peter Pringle: </b> Dear grover, the answer is I was not there on the day but arrived the next day and spent the following two and a half months investigating the day for the Sunday Times. I have also seen many of the new submissions to the Saville Inquiry. Our original report was published on April 23, 1972 in the Sunday Times. </p> <br> <p> <b>Morcheeba: </b> Dear Peter, sorry but I've not read your book. What's your new take in a nutshell? </p> <p> <b>Morcheeba: </b> Dear Morcheeba, unlike the Saville Inquiry, which is a legal investigation, our book tells the human story: the lives of those who took part in the march, why they marched, and how the 13 were killed and the 14 wounded. It also goes into the background of the military operation, using the new material that has come to light since 1972. In that sense it is a continuation of the story, not the definitive account which is the aim of the Saville inquiry at the end of its next two years of hearings. </p> <br> <p> <b>ppgm1953: </b> It has been admitted recently that there was a shoot to kill policy in NI (although perhaps later than Bloody Sunday). Do you feel that this may have been the case earlier? If so, was it a contributary factor to that Sunday? </p> <p> <b>PP: </b> Dear ppgm1953, this is one of the key avenues for the inquiry to follow. It was the conclusion of army high command in Northern Ireland at the time, that perhaps the only way of dealing with the regular Derry rioters -the Derry Young Hooligans, as the army called them - was to shoot selected ringleaders. A secret report to this effect was made to the officer commanding the Ulster-based forces three weeks before Bloody Sunday. The question is how far down the ranks had this attitude gone? </p> <br> <p> <b>Jonifame:</b> Peter, do you think that the Saville inquiry will actually help the peace process? What impact could it have? Is it better not to dwell on the past so much, tragic though it is? </p> <p> <b>PP: </b> Dear Jonifame, anything that clears up the inconsistencies and gaps in the Widgery inquiry could help the peace process by creating an atmosphere more conducive to talks. But there are minefields, obviously. One of them was identified last week when Saville's counsel introduced the MoD intelligence report about Martin McGuinness. Where that goes is anyone's guess. </p> <br> <p> <b>grover: </b> Peter, families of the dead already have their truth. The paras and their families already have their truth. How do you think the truth commission is going to be able to reconcile these diametrically opposed positions with a third version of the \"true truth\". Do you see it as an exercise in compromise to lay bones to rest, or a concerted effort to unearth facts buried through years of complicity on the part of those involved? </p> <p> <b>PP: </b> Dear grover, you're right in one sense. The families know who died and who was wounded; the paratroopers know who they shot. But in the previous Widgery inquiry many of the civilian eyewitnesses were never heard, and many MoD documents secret. In other words, the \"real\" truth is not known. Given the resources of the Saville inquiry, also the time interval and a new pile of declassified documents, we are bound to know more. </p> <br> <p> <b>Canselin: </b> What do you make of the allegations that Martin McGuinness was the IRA man who fired the first shot? Are they nonsense? </p> <p> <b>PP: </b> Dear Canselin, we will have to wait and see. The MoD by producing an unsourced, unattributable secret agent report has opened a new debate. McGuinness has denied the allegations. one secret agent report does not prove anything. </p> <br> <p> <b>SiKing: </b> 1. If Mr. McGuinness accepted an offer to give evidence to the Saville Inquiry, is it possible that he could be asked, under oath, to reveal details of his involvement in IRA activity not related to Bloody Sunday? </p> <p> 2. Is it realistic to expect a truthful outcome to the inquiry rather than something between a politically expedient compromise and the Widgery report? </p> <p> <b>PP: </b> Dear SiKing, 1. McGuinness could be asked those questions but he is under no obligation to answer them. None of the information he gives can be used to prosecute him in a different forum. 2. The obstacle to finding out the truth is more likely, in my view, to be the impossibility of making a single judgement from the great variety of the evidence now being presented than from the restrictions of political expediency. Everyone, on both sides, is now interested in closure of this event. </p> <br> <p><b>fmk: </b> Now that the UK govt is undertaking a proper inquiry into what went down in Derry, do you think the terrorists themselves can ever be convinced to undertake a proper public enquiry into the likes of Birmingham, Enniskillen or Omagh? Or does justice have several versions? </p> <p> <b>PP: </b> Dear fmk, I understand your point but of course a public inquiry must be started by the government. </p> <br> <p> <b>wh52: </b> How significant is the report that the Army has recently destroyed or disposed of rifles used that day? Apart from the simple loss of evidence can it also be read that the Army authorities still feel there are tracks to be covered? </p> <p> <b>PP: </b> Dear wh52, the SLR rifles that were used to fire the fatal shots on that day could have been used to match at least two of the bullets found in the bodies of those who were killed. In addition, it was possible that some of the rifles used on that day were re-bored from 7.62mm down to .22in. Without the rifles that mystery cannot be cleared up. </p> <p> <b>wh52: </b> May seem to be overly technical but how do you rebore a hole to a smaller diameter? Was it really fitting new barrels, in which case even if the rifles were available they might not have the actual barrels used. </p> <p> <b>PP: </b> Dear wh52, good point. Actually what you do, as I understand it, is put a sleeve into the barrel to downsize, as it were. You are right, if you can put a new sleeve in, you can surely take it out.

      "bodyText": "grover: What qualifies you to answer these questions about Bloody Sunday? Were you there? Do you have access to \"privileged\" information or is your controversial position a personal interpretation of existing facts? Peter Pringle: Dear grover, the answer is I was not there on the day but arrived the next day and spent the following two and a half months investigating the day for the Sunday Times. I have also seen many of the new submissions to the Saville Inquiry. Our original report was published on April 23, 1972 in the Sunday Times. Morcheeba: Dear Peter, sorry but I've not read your book. What's your new take in a nutshell? Morcheeba: Dear Morcheeba, unlike the Saville Inquiry, which is a legal investigation, our book tells the human story: the lives of those who took part in the march, why they marched, and how the 13 were killed and the 14 wounded. It also goes into the background of the military operation, using the new material that has come to light since 1972. In that sense it is a continuation of the story, not the definitive account which is the aim of the Saville inquiry at the end of its next two years of hearings. ppgm1953: It has been admitted recently that there was a shoot to kill policy in NI (although perhaps later than Bloody Sunday). Do you feel that this may have been the case earlier? If so, was it a contributary factor to that Sunday? PP: Dear ppgm1953, this is one of the key avenues for the inquiry to follow. It was the conclusion of army high command in Northern Ireland at the time, that perhaps the only way of dealing with the regular Derry rioters -the Derry Young Hooligans, as the army called them - was to shoot selected ringleaders. A secret report to this effect was made to the officer commanding the Ulster-based forces three weeks before Bloody Sunday. The question is how far down the ranks had this attitude gone? Jonifame: Peter, do you think that the Saville inquiry will actually help the peace process? What impact could it have? Is it better not to dwell on the past so much, tragic though it is? PP: Dear Jonifame, anything that clears up the inconsistencies and gaps in the Widgery inquiry could help the peace process by creating an atmosphere more conducive to talks. But there are minefields, obviously. One of them was identified last week when Saville's counsel introduced the MoD intelligence report about Martin McGuinness. Where that goes is anyone's guess. grover: Peter, families of the dead already have their truth. The paras and their families already have their truth. How do you think the truth commission is going to be able to reconcile these diametrically opposed positions with a third version of the \"true truth\". Do you see it as an exercise in compromise to lay bones to rest, or a concerted effort to unearth facts buried through years of complicity on the part of those involved? PP: Dear grover, you're right in one sense. The families know who died and who was wounded; the paratroopers know who they shot. But in the previous Widgery inquiry many of the civilian eyewitnesses were never heard, and many MoD documents secret. In other words, the \"real\" truth is not known. Given the resources of the Saville inquiry, also the time interval and a new pile of declassified documents, we are bound to know more. Canselin: What do you make of the allegations that Martin McGuinness was the IRA man who fired the first shot? Are they nonsense? PP: Dear Canselin, we will have to wait and see. The MoD by producing an unsourced, unattributable secret agent report has opened a new debate. McGuinness has denied the allegations. one secret agent report does not prove anything. SiKing: 1. If Mr. McGuinness accepted an offer to give evidence to the Saville Inquiry, is it possible that he could be asked, under oath, to reveal details of his involvement in IRA activity not related to Bloody Sunday? 2. Is it realistic to expect a truthful outcome to the inquiry rather than something between a politically expedient compromise and the Widgery report? PP: Dear SiKing, 1. McGuinness could be asked those questions but he is under no obligation to answer them. None of the information he gives can be used to prosecute him in a different forum. 2. The obstacle to finding out the truth is more likely, in my view, to be the impossibility of making a single judgement from the great variety of the evidence now being presented than from the restrictions of political expediency. Everyone, on both sides, is now interested in closure of this event. fmk: Now that the UK govt is undertaking a proper inquiry into what went down in Derry, do you think the terrorists themselves can ever be convinced to undertake a proper public enquiry into the likes of Birmingham, Enniskillen or Omagh? Or does justice have several versions? PP: Dear fmk, I understand your point but of course a public inquiry must be started by the government. wh52: How significant is the report that the Army has recently destroyed or disposed of rifles used that day? Apart from the simple loss of evidence can it also be read that the Army authorities still feel there are tracks to be covered? PP: Dear wh52, the SLR rifles that were used to fire the fatal shots on that day could have been used to match at least two of the bullets found in the bodies of those who were killed. In addition, it was possible that some of the rifles used on that day were re-bored from 7.62mm down to .22in. Without the rifles that mystery cannot be cleared up. wh52: May seem to be overly technical but how do you rebore a hole to a smaller diameter? Was it really fitting new barrels, in which case even if the rifles were available they might not have the actual barrels used. PP: Dear wh52, good point. Actually what you do, as I understand it, is put a sleeve into the barrel to downsize, as it were. You are right, if you can put a new sleeve in, you can surely take it out. Thus, it is possible that any downsized rifle could be upgraded before being handed over to the Saville inquiry. As you say, perhaps we are getting too technical here. But the issue remains - were any of the rifles downsized? PP: Dear all, thanks for all your questions. Sorry but I have to leave now. Hope you can get the book.",

He is the ultimate \"other\". And since he does not follow our moral code, we do not have to apply it when referring to him. It is the opening salvo in the broadside of white supremacy.

He makes his money by punching people in the head so hard that they fall over and are rendered unconscious. He delivers brain damage for a living. We may not like this (I certainly don't), but our dispute on that score is with boxing, not with Tyson. The one thing we can be certain of, if he does come to this country, is that he will beat at least one person up because that is the whole point of him being here.

In 1991 he raped Desiree Washington at a Miss Black America beauty pageant, a crime for which he was sentenced to six years in jail. Unlike the well-connected member of the Kennedy clan, who was in court facing the same charge at the same time, Tyson was not acquitted. He was punished. It is intriguing to hear liberals, whose views on criminal justice are generally underpinned by the idea that criminals can and should be rehabilitated, waive that argument in the case of Tyson as though his soul itself is irredeemable.

One-third of all young black men are either in jail, on probation or awaiting trial. He travels as part of a sport, boxing, which has turned that poverty into profit by exploiting those who take it up to within an inch of their lives. And he will arrive in a country which has pursued an immigration \"policy\" for the past 30 years of keeping black people out and asylum laws designed to criminalise the most vulnerable.</p> <p>How many of those MPs who will voice their opposition to Straw's decision in the Commons next week lost their voice when it came to the asylum bill, which offends the dignity of so many survivors of state-sponsored rape throughout the world?

People who use their blackness or femaleness as the end, rather than the starting point, of their ideology are destined to cut themselves off from the needs of others. \"I'll see your race and raise your gender,\" said the feminist to the black, male activist as both ignored the racism in the women's movement and sexism in the black community, as though there was only a strategic and no ethical response to the event.</p> <p>None of these points answer whether Tyson should be allowed in the country a second time, but relate to the blatantly racist, hypocritical manner in which the question was put the first time and the inadequacy of the response to it.

B4U Music, launched this month, is filling its slots with the latest chart-toppers from Bollywood, complete with video clips of athletic heroes chasing coy heroines around trees. </p> <p>How times have changed. Back in the 1980s, British Asians had to programme their videos for the occasional Bollywood movie that aired in the late night slots on BBC and ITV. Now, they're spoiled for choice. There are 14 UK channels broadcasting in south Asian languages such as Hindi, Bengali and Urdu. More are on the way. </p> <p>A colourful cast has already assembled for the battle of the Asian small screen. It includes two billionaires and the Japanese electronics giant Sony Corp. Even Star TV, the jewel in the crown of Rupert Murdoch's eastern empire, is considering starting a Hindi channel for Britain and Europe. </p> <p>The defending champion is the media mogul Subhash Chandra who heads Zee TV, the Indian entertainment powerhouse which is also the biggest player on Asian TV screens in Britain. He is worth about $5bn. </p> <p>Then there is the steel baron Lakshmi Mittal, Britain's fourth richest tycoon, who is worth \u00a32.2 bn according to the Sunday Times Rich List. Last year, Mittal threw his weight behind B4U (Bollywood for You), a movie channel showing five Hindi films a day. </p> <p>Zee is fighting back by starting more niche channels. In October, it started the all-singing, all-dancing music channel Music Asia. A few days later, it kicked off the Bengali language channel Alpha Bangla. </p> <p>But the Mittal-backed consortium is also moving quickly with the launch of its second channel, B4U Music, aimed at challenging Zee's Music Asia. In four months' time, it plans to launch a third, B4U South, which will broadcast south Indian screen hits. </p> <p>Also in the fray is Zee's arch-enemy, Sony Entertainment Television which was launched two years ago in Britain. It has struck a marketing alliance with B4U to outmanoeuvre the market leader. </p> <p>What's the prize these channels are fighting over? There are about 500,000 Asian households in Britain and Zee has around 150,000 subscribers. That may seem like small potatoes compared to a channel like Sky Movies, which reaches more than 2m households. But profit margins can be high because programmes are made cheaply and imported from India. \"Asian channels are serving a niche market and you've got to treat it like that. It shouldn't be compared with a giant like Sky,\" says Ash Jaswal, marketing executive with Sony Entertainment. </p> <p>What's the programming formula that makes Asians reach for the remote control and switch on their sets? For a start Bollywood is the world's second largest film industry and its blockbuster melodramas are crowd-pullers around the world. But Bollywood's starring role doesn't stop there. Its song and dance sequences are better than any music video and they are turned into Hindi Top of the Pops-style programmes. </p> <p>Then there are the serials produced on the Indian subcontinent. Back in the 1980s, serials such as Mahabharata, based on the Hindu epic, brought India to a standstill when they were broadcast. </p> <p>But what about second and third-generation British Asians who don't have fond childhood memories of the Indian subcontinent? For them, there are channels like the ambitious Channel East and Birmingham-based Asia 1 which broadcast in a mix of English and the main south Asian languages. </p> <p>The advent of digital broadcasting has changed the rules of the game completely, slashing costs. The transmission cost of putting a channel on air is now around \u00a350,000 per month, compared with about \u00a3400,000 before digital. Saad Saraf, of Media Reach, which follows the Asian television industry, says: \"Digital has made it that much easier. It needs roughly 25,000 subscribers to break even. That's why you see this explosion of channels.\" </p> <p>For the bigger players like Zee, a bouquet of channels brings in more revenue and can be broadcast for less than the price of putting out one analogue channel. Zee, which says it reaches around 150,000 households, charges around \u00a312 for a monthly subscription. About 60% of its revenue comes from subscriptions and the rest from advertising. </p> <p>But the economics of Asian broadcasting also depend on cheap programming from the Indian subcontinent. Zee started out by making some programmes in Britain but has cut back over the years. Most of its key rivals like Sony aren't yet contemplating local programming. Most companies reckon programmes can be made for a fifth of the price in India or Pakistan. And each channel is playing the same game. </p> <p>One station that doesn't have to worry about programming is B4U. Kishore Lulla, one of B4U's backers owns the international rights to around 1,700 Bollywood movies and is snapping up more all the time. </p> <p>Of course, south Asians aren't the only ones rushing to start channels. The ITC, which regulates the television industry in Britain, reckons about 400 stations have permission to broadcast. There are channels aimed at the Chinese community and Arabic speakers. But the south Asians from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh are ahead of all other ethnic minority groups and one reason is language. India has more than 20 official languages. </p> <p>Television is a cut-throat business and there may not be many winners in this multi-cornered battle. But it is certain that more Asian channels will be arriving on the crowded battlefield and it will be a long time before the victors emerge.</p>",

But the Mittal-backed consortium is also moving quickly with the launch of its second channel, B4U Music, aimed at challenging Zee's Music Asia. In four months' time, it plans to launch a third, B4U South, which will broadcast south Indian screen hits. Also in the fray is Zee's arch-enemy, Sony Entertainment Television which was launched two years ago in Britain. It has struck a marketing alliance with B4U to outmanoeuvre the market leader. What's the prize these channels are fighting over? There are about 500,000 Asian households in Britain and Zee has around 150,000 subscribers. That may seem like small potatoes compared to a channel like Sky Movies, which reaches more than 2m households. But profit margins can be high because programmes are made cheaply and imported from India. \"Asian channels are serving a niche market and you've got to treat it like that. It shouldn't be compared with a giant like Sky,\" says Ash Jaswal, marketing executive with Sony Entertainment. What's the programming formula that makes Asians reach for the remote control and switch on their sets? For a start Bollywood is the world's second largest film industry and its blockbuster melodramas are crowd-pullers around the world. But Bollywood's starring role doesn't stop there. Its song and dance sequences are better than any music video and they are turned into Hindi Top of the Pops-style programmes. Then there are the serials produced on the Indian subcontinent. Back in the 1980s, serials such as Mahabharata, based on the Hindu epic, brought India to a standstill when they were broadcast. But what about second and third-generation British Asians who don't have fond childhood memories of the Indian subcontinent? For them, there are channels like the ambitious Channel East and Birmingham-based Asia 1 which broadcast in a mix of English and the main south Asian languages. The advent of digital broadcasting has changed the rules of the game completely, slashing costs. The transmission cost of putting a channel on air is now around \u00a350,000 per month, compared with about \u00a3400,000 before digital. Saad Saraf, of Media Reach, which follows the Asian television industry, says: \"Digital has made it that much easier. It needs roughly 25,000 subscribers to break even. That's why you see this explosion of channels.\" For the bigger players like Zee, a bouquet of channels brings in more revenue and can be broadcast for less than the price of putting out one analogue channel. Zee, which says it reaches around 150,000 households, charges around \u00a312 for a monthly subscription. About 60% of its revenue comes from subscriptions and the rest from advertising. But the economics of Asian broadcasting also depend on cheap programming from the Indian subcontinent. Zee started out by making some programmes in Britain but has cut back over the years. Most of its key rivals like Sony aren't yet contemplating local programming. Most companies reckon programmes can be made for a fifth of the price in India or Pakistan. And each channel is playing the same game. One station that doesn't have to worry about programming is B4U. Kishore Lulla, one of B4U's backers owns the international rights to around 1,700 Bollywood movies and is snapping up more all the time. Of course, south Asians aren't the only ones rushing to start channels. The ITC, which regulates the television industry in Britain, reckons about 400 stations have permission to broadcast. There are channels aimed at the Chinese community and Arabic speakers. But the south Asians from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh are ahead of all other ethnic minority groups and one reason is language. India has more than 20 official languages. Television is a cut-throat business and there may not be many winners in this multi-cornered battle. But it is certain that more Asian channels will be arriving on the crowded battlefield and it will be a long time before the victors emerge.",

The Grand Prize of Cannes 2000, which is in effect the runners-up award, went to the Chinese Devils At The Doorstep, the Best Director prize was given to Edward Yang, the Taiwanese director, for A One And A Two, and Best Actor was Hong Kong star Tony Leung for Wong Kar-wei's In The Mood For Love. These films and others enlivened a competition which, if it had relied on Europe and America would have been infinitely less rewarding. As is usual with international juries these days, almost everything that moved across the screen from Iran was given a prize, but at least one of them was deserved - twenty-year-old Samira Makhmalbaf's (pictured) The Blackboard which won the minor jury prize. The Camera D'or for best first film was shared by two rather less good Iranian films - Djomeh and A Time For Drunken Horses. Poor old Britain represented in the competition by Ken Loach's Bread And Roses and James Ivory's The Golden Bowl got nothing, though many thought Ivory's adaptation of the Henry James' novel the best thing he had done for some time. But it has to be said that this year's competition was more difficult than most to judge. It was the strongest for some time, if also the one where good editors seemed to be a defunct species. In all, the jury must have seen some 48-hours of film in 10 days.",

      "bodyText": "The Conservatives today called on the government to clarify the British mission in Sierra Leone amid indications that the government may arm government forces there. Shadow defence secretary Iain Duncan Smith said his party continued to support British troops but added: \"There now appears to be frustration in the military over the lack of clarity of their aims... The government must now clarify its mission and set clear objectives to give British troops the flexibility to operate in the way they feel best suited to achieving their mission.\" Defence secretary Geoff Hoon yesterday signalled that the UK could give a long-term commitment to help the Sierra Leone army take on rebel forces. Mr Hoon said military help and advice would continue even after British paratroopers withdrew. \"For some time we have had advisers present,\" he said yesterday. \"That is something we will continue. Obviously we have to have regard for the safety of anyone who goes there to train the army of Sierra Leone and when the situation is safe, we can take that forward.\" According to the Daily Telegraph, British paratroopers could leave within 10 days under an exit strategy being considered by the government. The paper reported that British commanders plan to arm the Sierra Leone army and train up their troops to be capable of attacking the rebels. The move, which could be seen an escalation of British involvement, came as news emerged about a missing British aid worker. Major Andrew Harrison, the British UN observer taken hostage in Sierra Leone, has sent an email to his wife saying he is safe and well. He was released nine days ago after being held captive for 11 days in the jungle by RUF rebels. However, he remains trapped behind rebel lines in a UN compound at Kailahun, in the north of the country, along with 10 other former observers.

Fifty-four more UN hostages were freed yesterday, but the government said it will not compromise on its handling of detained rebel leader Foday Sankoh in order to secure the releases of nearly 300 additional captives. \"There is no connection,\" said information minister Julius Spencer. A government investigation to decide whether to prosecute Mr Sankoh, who was captured last week, had not yet been completed, he added.

      "body": "<p>Every week there is another takeover or merger of regional newspapers. A fortnight ago, after a competition commission report cleared the way for three large chains to offer bids, Newsquest snaffled Newscom. So Newsquest, which already owns 130 titles, added a further 60 papers based in the south of England and South Wales with a stock market value of more than \u00a3400m. </p> <p>Newsquest is itself a subsidiary of the USA's largest newspaper corpoartion, Gannett, with 74 newspapers across America selling 6.6m a day. Last week it was the turn of Johnston Press, owner of 168 titles, to buy 14 more papers from Southnews, which were an unwanted part of a package of 33 titles it acquired in March. </p> <p>But these latest moves towards greater consolidation in the regional newspaper industry will not satisfy the appetites of the leading companies. It isn't happening fast enough, or smoothly enough, for them. </p> <p>They are calling on the government to do away with all competition regulations in order to speed the process of mergers and acquisitions. </p> <p>My understanding is that ministers are beginning to bend to the owners' wishes, and before the government gets close to making that mistake, it is imperative that everyone wakes up to the dangers that lie ahead. </p> <p>Previously, I have been relatively relaxed about the gradual formation of regional chains in Britain. Those in charge of the main groups have good track records, care about newspapers and in most cases have invested wisely. </p> <p>It's fair to say that they have saved many titles which might well have gone to the wall under previous owners who failed to take the right decisions. There is no denying that most of the groups in the chart have done well. </p> <p>But the alarm bells began to sound when Newsquest was forced by its venture capital backers to sell to Gannett. Was it in our interest, I asked myself, for an American company which has attracted opprobrium from journalists in its own country for cost-cutting and squeezing editorial resources to own the Brighton Evening Argus or the Bradford Telegraph and Argus? </p> <p>Now the sound of those bells is deafening. In an important recent speech Tim Bowdler, chief executive of Johnston Press, argued that the time had come to do away with the regulations which have been in force for almost 40 years - though many times amended - to prevent too great a concentration of ownership. Similarly, he wishes to set aside rules inhibiting cross-media ownership. </p> <p>He was not speaking just for himself but for all the large owners who have been lobbying hard through their organisation, the Newspaper Society, to bring about these changes. </p> <p>It has to be said that there is some merit in their arguments. As Bowdler rightly pointed out, it is plainly ridiculous that his company had to seek prior approval to acquire the Arbroath Herald and the Broughty Ferry, Carnoustie and Monifieth Guide and Gazette with a combined circulation of approximately 10,000 copies. Yet Johnston Press itself, with 168 titles, could be acquired by a foreign conglomerate tomorrow. </p> <p>That kind of absurdity obviously requires a reform of the competition rules, just as the criteria for a referral - which usually hinge on an outdated concept of competition for advertising revenue - need amendment. </p> <p>But that doesn't mean that we should have a free-for-all, allowing the formation of huge media combines or, worse, creating the conditions for the wholesale purchase of our regional newspapers by US-based global media cartels which have made a fetish of driving up profit margins. </p> <p>Bowdler and the others are consumed with the idea that they are too small and weak to compete with the world's multi-media players. Not only must they be big, but huge, enormous, gigantic. Smallness and local-ness, to coin a word, are no longer economically viable. Size is everything. </p> <p>Small companies in mature industries are considered largely irrelevant. If they want a decent future they must combine into ever-expanding chains. Big is beautiful. </p> <p>This may make life interesting, even fun, for businessmen, but is it good for the future of our local weekly papers? </p> <p>Bowdler argues that \"specialist newspaper provisions are unnecessary\" and that \"newspapers should be subject only to general competition law\". In other words, papers should be regarded as a product like any other. </p> <p>Now forgive me if I sound a little romantic, but I happen to believe that papers are different and special. They cannot be seen in the same light as other goods, such as cars or (with apologies to Tony O'Reilly's past occupation) baked beans. Papers may be commercial operations but they have a public purpose. That's why they must be treated as different and special. That was the view of three royal commissions. It's also the view, I suspect, of most MPs and of governments, of whatever hue, in the past. I also fondly imagine it to be the view of the people who buy papers too. </p> <p>I see no genuine reason to change our minds about the fundamental point: papers require a different regulatory regime from other forms of business. </p> <p>In truth, there is only one reason to wipe out the regulatory framework and that, of course, is profit. </p> <p>Papers have always straddled the line between public service and private profit, finding a way to make them mutually compatible for the benefit of both the reader and the owner. The balance between the two is delicate. What I fear is that the tearing asunder of all regulations will create an imbalance which could, in the long run, destroy our national network of local and regional papers. In the long term, profit will eclipse all sense of public purpose. </p> <p>I agree that we have reason to praise Bowdler and his fellow chief executives. But they are not the only good owners. Lots of much smaller companies, from the vibrant Kent Messenger group with several sales-winning successes to Joan Trimble's wonderful single title, the Impartial Reporter of Enniskillen, have fine records too. </p> <p>They keep close to their communities and to their readers. So far, our bigger companies have succeeded in doing so too. But if we remove regulations, or fail to get to grips with the encroachment of foreign ownership (which many other countries restrict), I foresee an unwholesome scenario. </p> <p>Imagine a future in which an accountant in Atlanta decides that the Giggleswick Guardian's editor must make do with one part-time reporter in place of his two full-time staff because the Yorkshire United Press division of its UK-based Anglo-Georgia Newspapers plc, a subsidiary of the US-owned Internet Corporation of America, is required to improve its profit margin by a full 1% in the next financial year. Far-fetched? Maybe. After all, what earthly sense is there in a company squeezing a little paper to death in order to make a fast buck? </p> <p>\u0095 Roy Greenslade, abridged from a speech made to the Newspaper Society's annual meeting</p> <p><strong>Change the game</strong></p> <p>When Johnston Press agreed to buy the Broughty Ferry, Carnoustie and Monifieth Guide and Gazette, with a circulation of around 2,000 copies and no overlap with any of its newspaper titles, it required consent from the Department of Trade and Industry under the special merger provisions to which regional newspaper publishers are subject. Yet virtually every other industry sector, including other media, is subject only to general competition law. </p> <p>In a large number of cases, prior approval has extended to the statutory requirement for a full competition commission inquiry. But while the UK's regional press is subject to these onerous constraints, foreign newspaper publishers are freely able to acquire newspapers in this country. </p> <p>Similarly, venture capitalists have been active buyers of regional papers, because they see the opportunity for a quick profit. It's their good fortune that regional publishers have been unable to compete on a level playing field. </p> <p>The process of consolidation in the media, telecoms and entertainment industries continues apace. Mega deals seem not to raise a regulatory eyebrow and increasing concentration of ownership looks inevitable in commercial television and radio. And yet the regulatory mindset presumes that consolidation of the regional press should be strictly and arbitrarily controlled. </p> <p>The regulations which govern newspaper mergers are based on a royal commission which reported in 1962. While there have been modifications since then, the special newspaper merger controls have remained largely unchanged. The dramatic changes to the media landscape since 1962 have resulted in a proliferation of media choice. </p> <p>There are no longer static geographic monopolies of information. Regional papers now face a vast array of competition for the attention of their communities and for the advertising revenues which represent the lifeblood of the business. </p> <p>The current regulations greatly disadvantage the regional press in the face of this intensifying competition. The ability to achieve efficiencies through consolidation is essential if the industry is to defend its market position. There is also a need for continued investment in systems and printing capacity, in improving editorial content and presentation, and to embrace the opportunities presented by the new media. However, the industry's ability to invest in these areas will also be a function of the extent to which further consolidation takes place. </p> <p>Roy Greenslade's view that consolidation threatens editorial independence and quality is misguided. Firstly, neither the DTI nor the competition commission has ever found that regional publishers are pursuing editorial policies which are contrary to the public interest. The reason is simple: newspapers which fail to retain readers will struggle to maintain advertising revenues. Secondly, the larger players have invested heavily to meet market needs and indeed where acquisitions have been made, they have provided much-needed investment for those businesses. </p> <p>And finally, Mr Greenslade fails to recognise the intensity of competition faced by regional newspapers. Make no mistake, the ability to produce good newspapers is fundamentally dependent upon healthy advertising revenues. </p> <p>Newspapers should not be ring-fenced in a manner which subjects them to greater regulation than their competitors. The industry should be permitted to consolidate subject only to general competition law, just as its competitors are increasingly free to do. </p> <p>What is more, a failure to remove discriminatory controls will put in jeopardy the industry's ability to provide the local editorial voices which the current regulations were originally put in place to protect. </p> <p>Mr Greenslade's concerns about multinational media conglomerates are best regulated by general EU and UK competition law. </p> <p>A feature in the Guardian more than a year ago concluded: \"This government needs to reconsider competition policy in relation to newspapers, especially at regional level, and ask whether the public interest is really being served at present. In a rapidly developing multimedia world, the nature of competition from non-print sources needs to be built into the criteria too.\" </p> <p>It was written by Mr Greenslade. I tend to agree with him. We both want regional and local newspapers to flourish. The current ownership regulations need to change radically and quickly if this is to happen. </p> <p>\u0095 Tim Bowdler, chief executive of Johnston Press plc.</p>",

Firstly, neither the DTI nor the competition commission has ever found that regional publishers are pursuing editorial policies which are contrary to the public interest. The reason is simple: newspapers which fail to retain readers will struggle to maintain advertising revenues. Secondly, the larger players have invested heavily to meet market needs and indeed where acquisitions have been made, they have provided much-needed investment for those businesses. And finally, Mr Greenslade fails to recognise the intensity of competition faced by regional newspapers. Make no mistake, the ability to produce good newspapers is fundamentally dependent upon healthy advertising revenues. Newspapers should not be ring-fenced in a manner which subjects them to greater regulation than their competitors. The industry should be permitted to consolidate subject only to general competition law, just as its competitors are increasingly free to do. What is more, a failure to remove discriminatory controls will put in jeopardy the industry's ability to provide the local editorial voices which the current regulations were originally put in place to protect. Mr Greenslade's concerns about multinational media conglomerates are best regulated by general EU and UK competition law. A feature in the Guardian more than a year ago concluded: \"This government needs to reconsider competition policy in relation to newspapers, especially at regional level, and ask whether the public interest is really being served at present. In a rapidly developing multimedia world, the nature of competition from non-print sources needs to be built into the criteria too.\" It was written by Mr Greenslade. I tend to agree with him. We both want regional and local newspapers to flourish. The current ownership regulations need to change radically and quickly if this is to happen. \u0095 Tim Bowdler, chief executive of Johnston Press plc.",

      "body": "<p>There was probably only one man in the wild west of UK publishing who could have pulled it off. Last week James Brown, the maverick editor who gave the world Loaded and new men the freedom to be lads, successfully floated his publishing company IFG on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) at a valuation of \u00a310m, before so much as a single national title or website had been launched. </p> <p>Down at the offices of the newly-christened IFeelGood Holdings plc, in Clerkenwell, central London, it's impossible not to catch the feelgood bug. The 24 hours since the company raised the \u00a33.6m that it needed to launch its first three titles have been ecstatic, frenetic, surreal. There's been no time to celebrate in the traditional manner of an all-night bender - that's not the reason why Brown has a pair of dark glasses strapped to his face - but the goggle-eyed expressions of IFG staff say it all. </p> <p>Brown was up at 6am to talk on the Money Channel about his flotation strategy. The phone has been going all day. Felix Dennis, the millionaire publisher who owns a 10% stake in the company as non-executive chairman, called to offer another \u00a3500,000, then there was a meeting with a top Hollywood fixer for Hotdog (IFG's first big launch, a magazine for movie fanatics, out on Friday) and there was just time to go home, change, \"listen to Lou Reed and the Beastie Boys\" and come back in. </p> <p>Cavorting around his retro orange, green and purple offices (\"Come on, let me show you around!\") like Willy Wonka in his chocolate factory (his own analogy), Brown introduces his team of \"geniuses\" or \"oompa-loompas\" who are eating their way through a gift box of muffins. There's Paul Henderson, aka \"the grunge\", the art director who came with him from GQ; there's Ben Olins, the \"mod\", editor of Hotdog, formerly Guardian Guide editor; Neil Jeffries, contributing editor, aka \"the rocker\", and Brown himself is of course \"the godfather of soul\". </p> <p>His role as CEO, editorial director and honorary \"idiot savant\" - a title bestowed upon him by Dennis who believes Brown has the Midas touch - will be \"to give the company direction\", to use those instincts which made IPC a lot of money back in 1994 when they took on a 26-year-old football fanatic with an idea for a fantasy men's mag, and just to \"be James Brown\", as he puts it. </p> <p>\"The general opinion is that to launch anything you need 99% straight guys and one maverick - well, I think it's the other way round,\" says Brown contentiously. Mavericks maybe, but his non-executive directors and financial advisers Chris Akers and Rodger Sargent knew exactly what they were doing when they advised Brown to go for an early float. </p> <p>It looked like a huge gamble. Premature flotation proved a disaster for new media companies such as Lastminute.com and YesTV and if the shares had bottomed out, IFG would be in an untenable position right now. But to the chagrin of many rivals in the industry who were hoping Brown might get his comeuppance, it paid off - with a PR windfall. </p> <p>\"It wasn't just my reputation it was floated on,\" says Brown. \"It was the reputations of Dennis, myself and Chris Akers\" (who recently sold his Sports Internet Group to Sky for millions). \"The beauty of IFG is that we have strong editorial talent and we can apply that to anything - content is king.\" The invitation to join the founding editor of Loaded and the publisher of Maxim around the table at a game of Risk proved irresistible to many City brokers, who were after all Brown's most loyal readership in his Loaded days. </p> <p>With Hotdog, the magazine for men who've \"been watching too many movies\", Brown hopes to use his in-joke magic to give what is otherwise a highly commercial, tightly-niched film and DVD industry driver the feel of a national fanzine. Digital Home Video is the hottest spot in publishing this month with four launches in the sector. Hotdog is meat and sauce between two wedges of carbohydrate for the \"staying in\" generation. </p> <p>The cover promises \"Scandals, Starlets and Car Chases\" and carries a drawing of Robert De Niro as Travis Bickle, the anti-hero of Taxi Driver and movie buffs' favourite loony after Norman Bates. Inside there is a centre spread on the film - including a spoof interview with Travis - sizzler du jour Angelina Jolie in a surprisingly tasteful fashion shoot, and an investigation into the paranoia surrounding the Church of Scientology and its links to John Travolta's new movie. </p> <p>\"Travis said he'd only do the interview if he got the cover,\" quips Brown, explaining that \"we wanted an icon. A character from a film that came out 15 years ago means more to me than a publicity stunt.\" It makes a change from the slavish PR agendas that mainstream movie mags follow.

      "bodyText": "There was probably only one man in the wild west of UK publishing who could have pulled it off. Last week James Brown, the maverick editor who gave the world Loaded and new men the freedom to be lads, successfully floated his publishing company IFG on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) at a valuation of \u00a310m, before so much as a single national title or website had been launched. Down at the offices of the newly-christened IFeelGood Holdings plc, in Clerkenwell, central London, it's impossible not to catch the feelgood bug. The 24 hours since the company raised the \u00a33.6m that it needed to launch its first three titles have been ecstatic, frenetic, surreal. There's been no time to celebrate in the traditional manner of an all-night bender - that's not the reason why Brown has a pair of dark glasses strapped to his face - but the goggle-eyed expressions of IFG staff say it all. Brown was up at 6am to talk on the Money Channel about his flotation strategy. The phone has been going all day. Felix Dennis, the millionaire publisher who owns a 10% stake in the company as non-executive chairman, called to offer another \u00a3500,000, then there was a meeting with a top Hollywood fixer for Hotdog (IFG's first big launch, a magazine for movie fanatics, out on Friday) and there was just time to go home, change, \"listen to Lou Reed and the Beastie Boys\" and come back in. Cavorting around his retro orange, green and purple offices (\"Come on, let me show you around!\") like Willy Wonka in his chocolate factory (his own analogy), Brown introduces his team of \"geniuses\" or \"oompa-loompas\" who are eating their way through a gift box of muffins. There's Paul Henderson, aka \"the grunge\", the art director who came with him from GQ; there's Ben Olins, the \"mod\", editor of Hotdog, formerly Guardian Guide editor; Neil Jeffries, contributing editor, aka \"the rocker\", and Brown himself is of course \"the godfather of soul\". His role as CEO, editorial director and honorary \"idiot savant\" - a title bestowed upon him by Dennis who believes Brown has the Midas touch - will be \"to give the company direction\", to use those instincts which made IPC a lot of money back in 1994 when they took on a 26-year-old football fanatic with an idea for a fantasy men's mag, and just to \"be James Brown\", as he puts it. \"The general opinion is that to launch anything you need 99% straight guys and one maverick - well, I think it's the other way round,\" says Brown contentiously. Mavericks maybe, but his non-executive directors and financial advisers Chris Akers and Rodger Sargent knew exactly what they were doing when they advised Brown to go for an early float. It looked like a huge gamble. Premature flotation proved a disaster for new media companies such as Lastminute.com and YesTV and if the shares had bottomed out, IFG would be in an untenable position right now. But to the chagrin of many rivals in the industry who were hoping Brown might get his comeuppance, it paid off - with a PR windfall. \"It wasn't just my reputation it was floated on,\" says Brown. \"It was the reputations of Dennis, myself and Chris Akers\" (who recently sold his Sports Internet Group to Sky for millions). \"The beauty of IFG is that we have strong editorial talent and we can apply that to anything - content is king.\" The invitation to join the founding editor of Loaded and the publisher of Maxim around the table at a game of Risk proved irresistible to many City brokers, who were after all Brown's most loyal readership in his Loaded days. With Hotdog, the magazine for men who've \"been watching too many movies\", Brown hopes to use his in-joke magic to give what is otherwise a highly commercial, tightly-niched film and DVD industry driver the feel of a national fanzine. Digital Home Video is the hottest spot in publishing this month with four launches in the sector. Hotdog is meat and sauce between two wedges of carbohydrate for the \"staying in\" generation. The cover promises \"Scandals, Starlets and Car Chases\" and carries a drawing of Robert De Niro as Travis Bickle, the anti-hero of Taxi Driver and movie buffs' favourite loony after Norman Bates. Inside there is a centre spread on the film - including a spoof interview with Travis - sizzler du jour Angelina Jolie in a surprisingly tasteful fashion shoot, and an investigation into the paranoia surrounding the Church of Scientology and its links to John Travolta's new movie. \"Travis said he'd only do the interview if he got the cover,\" quips Brown, explaining that \"we wanted an icon. A character from a film that came out 15 years ago means more to me than a publicity stunt.\" It makes a change from the slavish PR agendas that mainstream movie mags follow. Hotdogmagazine.com, launched simultaneously, will have its own identity. Adam Porter, who as editor of UpLoaded brought in 1m visitors a month and also edits his own fan ezine, Year Zero, on the side, has been busy signing deals with cult short film production companies. And with columnists like Ivan Narge, better known as Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss's \"minder\", and Kerri Sharpem, who was head of Virgin's \"exotic\" publishing arm, the site could become Hotdog's red light zone. The next two titles, a lifestyle magazine (target date December 2000 - Brown will not be more specific) and a leisure title (mid-2001), will be launched with sister websites alongside. The company's AIM admission brochure emphasises the increasing importance of online revenue streams. Another central plank of the Brownian strategy is creative consultancy and content syndication. \"I started IFG in the first place to harness my alternative revenue stream, I was earning money from talking to ad agencies about cheese and tomato sauce - and I needed a bank account.\" There were other motivations, he says: \"IFG was actually a mood.

      "body": "<p>It was with some trepidation that a delegation of ITV chiefs embarked on the taxi ride from their swanky network headquarters, across central London to the slightly less salubrious home of the independent television commission on Wednesday evening. Their nervousness during the journey was understandable: the following morning, the commission would meet formally to discuss ITV's justification for sweeping News at Ten from the evening schedules to make way for ratings-boosting drama and entertainment. Given the regulator's immoderate pronouncements about the issue a month earlier, it would be a tense meeting. </p> <p>Despite the initial coolness, the smooth-talking ITV director of programmes, David Liddiment gave a polished presentation, with moral support from ITV chairman Leslie Hill. He told commission members, led by chairman Sir Robin Biggam and chief executive Peter Rogers, that ITV would invest up to \u00a320m in new programmes for the 9-11pm slot to boost audiences in the run-up to the problematic Nightly News, and a new soap would help to stem the decline in the early evening schedule. News audiences were already looking better than when the ITC blew its top a few weeks earlier, and the rot was in retreat, he said. </p> <p>The commission members were impressed with Liddiment's positive tone. They liked the promise of more money, and some had begun to be won over to the argument that ratings for news bulletins largely depend on the popularity of the shows that precede them. The ITV delegation left the meeting feeling more relaxed than when it arrived. </p> <p>So it was a surprise when the call came at about 2pm the following day to say that the commission had unanimously rejected the plan. Anger was fuelled when the press release arrived an hour later: \"This will be ITV's last opportunity to present proposals, since the uncertainty cannot be allowed to continue,\" thundered Biggam. It was a bit rich, said ITV bosses, given that it was the commission itself that was perpetuating the uncertainty. After declaring May 18 the deadline, it now gave ITV another two weeks to produce a new plan. Like errant schoolboys, ITV executives were told to come up with a \"final set of proposals\" by June 9, in time for the next ITC meeting on June 22. </p> <p>The chasm between regulator and broadcaster is as wide as ever; rarely has such a breakdown in the way British TV is run been exposed in public. \"Even if they are in dialogue, communication has broken down: the two sides keep missing each other,\" says one informed insider. </p> <p>It is clear there are different shades of opinion within the regulator. Officials, led by outgoing ITC chief executive Peter Rogers, are sympathetic to the pressures of the free market, and keen not to be presented as overbearing. Yet commission members unanimously voted down ITV's plans. </p> <p>Over at the network, executives are still misreading the ITC's signals on this most sensitive of issues. Since last autumn when pressure for the news review mounted, ITV has consistently been wrong-footed. It should have been obvious that the ITC, given its stated views last month on the fall in news audiences (regional news shows were down 22%), would not be satisfied with the status quo. The ITC expected a significant gesture, to address its conviction that the news experiment has not worked: crucially, 6.30pm for national news is a bit too early, and 11pm, with regional news tacked on, a bit too late. </p> <p>But Liddiment and his ITV colleagues could not bring themselves to give commission members what they really wanted: a change in the news schedule. There is little doubt that had ITV offered to move the 11pm bulletin to 10.30pm, the ITC would have been placated. But the ITV chiefs - angered that an under-pressure regulator has apparently moved the goalpoasts since first giving permission for the schedule change in March last year - had rallied round the network line. A 10.30pm news would be the worst of all possible worlds. There would be no place for current affairs such as Tonight and John Pilger's work, no place for late-night drama, and no place for the regional programmes that are often shown at 10.30pm, they threatened. Viewing figures would increase in the short term, but ITV's overall share of the evening audience would soon start to drop off. Given that ITV is not even on course to meet current targets this year, such a move would be suicidal. They thought the ITC would give way: instead, the network is back on the rack. </p> <p>\"We were surprised,\" says Hill. \"We thought we had offered a substantial set of changes. But jaw jaw is better than war war. We shall strive to produce acceptable measures.\" Would such an \"acceptable measure\" mean ITV, against its better judgement, opting to head off a damaging row by giving in to the commission's demand for a News at 10.30pm? On that, Hill is silent. </p> <p>Before last week, the ITV companies had stood firm. During a two-hour debate on the issue at ITV's ruling council meeting on May 8, all the companies stuck to their guns, some more solidly than others, united behind the current schedule, which Liddiment argues is working well, and bringing in the crucial younger viewers. The \"honourable compromise\" of a 10.30pm bulletin was rejected, but with Carlton and Granada said to be more hawkish than United News &amp; Media. Now, the ball is back in ITV's court. Urgent meetings have already been held, and Liddiment will be in constant contact over the next week from Los Angeles, where he is viewing up-and-coming US shows. </p> <p>Paul Bonner, who is writing the official history of independent television in Britain - authorised by the ITC - is amazed that it has gone this far. \"It is bizarre. Both sides are in a position of confrontation most would seek to avoid. But people do back themselves into situations.\" </p> <p>Should ITV refuse to compromise, arguing that technically it is meeting licence requirements to provide high-quality news in peak time, the ITC could use two regulatory weapons. First, it could cancel the variation in the ITV licences it granted in November 1998, which allowed ITV to move News at Ten. This is something of a blunt instrument, however, and the ITC does not see this as a viable option, even though it would delight government ministers, who believe 10.30pm is still too late for news. </p> <p>As a back-up, the ITC is looking to the catch-all wording in the broadcasting act which requires ITV to provide \"such services which taken as a whole are of high quality\". This would allow the ITC to order a judicial review in the high court. </p> <p>But does it dare go to law? The high court option would be the equivalent of pressing the nuclear button. A judicial review would throw the spotlight on the ITC's very purpose: a forensic examination of which would be highly damaging just at the time when the government is considering the whole future of regulation. (The government chose a squad of experts last week to come up with ideas in advance of the communications white paper, expected in the autumn.) The ITC is under threat: there are well-sourced reports that the commission is heading for the axe. </p> <p>In this light, it is easier to understand the commission's delicate position. Politicians want the return of News at Ten, yet the ITC knows that if it attempts seriously to stand up to ITV, it could precipitate its own demise. In so many ways this is an old-fashioned dispute, with politicians on the one side, a modern television network facing the pressures of a multi-media explosion on another, and a nervous and indecisive regulator in the middle. </p> <p>That certainly is the view of advertisers. Graham Duff, chief executive of Zenith Media, says: \"I find it remarkable that the regulator is putting this amount of pressure on ITV. It should be allowed to operate as it sees fit. And as for ordinary people to be told what's good for them to watch, it is deeply insulting.\" </p> <p>Even if ITV, supported by appalled advertisers, is right in its commercial interests in trying to stick with its new schedules, delivering an extra \u00a370m of revenue a year, the timing of the row could not be worse. The growing debate about ITV's public service and regional duties is becoming bound up with a broader debate about media ownership, the consolidation of ITV and future regulation. </p> <p>Sir George Russell, the former chairman of the ITC and the architect of the current detailed licences who gave evidence to the media select committee urging great caution in ending News at Ten, says: \"The ITC must insist they get the local news right. The fundamental thing is that the change in news is undermining the regional news provision. ITV is designed as a federal organisation. We always knew takeovers would take place but the 15 franchises would remain. Anyone involved in a takeover would be stuck with honouring those commitments. I know from my contacts that the regional news services are in disarray.\" </p> <p>That is why developments are being watched, open-mouthed, with a mix of enjoyment and horror by the BBC and Channel 4. There is a degree of sympathy for Liddiment - they know how hard it is to change back, or change at all, and that new schedules need time to bed in. But as the white paper approaches, time is running out for ITV. </p> <p>Hill met the culture secretary, Chris Smith, earlier this month to assure him that ITV, despite the defiance over News at Ten, wants to remain a key public service broadcaster, with all the protection that provides. But, as an observer says: \"They are losing credibility, and are coming to be regarded cynically by the government. In normal times, you'd expect the ITC to edge them into a sensible debate. This time, it's combustion. The ITV companies have mishandled it horribly. They have been so defiant in public. They have riled everyone.\" (The decision last week to screen the Queen Mother's 100th birthday pageant, a PR coup handed on a plate by the BBC, was in part seen as an opportunity to ingratiate the network with conservative-minded politicians.) </p> <p>It has become fashionable to allege - though it is disputed as \"rubbish\" by Hill - that ITV lacks leadership. Without a chief executive since Richard Eyre quit last autumn, it has certainly lacked a diplomatic spokesman to finesse its case. </p> <p>But another evident truth is that Granada, Carlton and United News &amp; Media, the three power players, have been distracted by something much bigger and more vital to their interests: merger mania and who will emerge dominant. Last Friday, United was back at the competition commission, which is in the final stages of preparing its report over the United/Carlton merger in which Granada, itself in the throes of demerger, hopes to intervene. Stephen Byers, the trade secretary, receives the report on June 16, a few days before the ITC meets to discuss the news issue again. </p> <p>The competition commission is not concerned, as the ITC must be, about regional news, or News at Ten, but the government is. This is why the messy compromise of a 10.30pm bulletin may yet win through. The main ITV players, at the end of the day, have much bigger things on their plate. And, like it not, they need a benign government to nod things through.</p>",

There is little doubt that had ITV offered to move the 11pm bulletin to 10.30pm, the ITC would have been placated. But the ITV chiefs - angered that an under-pressure regulator has apparently moved the goalpoasts since first giving permission for the schedule change in March last year - had rallied round the network line. A 10.30pm news would be the worst of all possible worlds. There would be no place for current affairs such as Tonight and John Pilger's work, no place for late-night drama, and no place for the regional programmes that are often shown at 10.30pm, they threatened. Viewing figures would increase in the short term, but ITV's overall share of the evening audience would soon start to drop off. Given that ITV is not even on course to meet current targets this year, such a move would be suicidal. They thought the ITC would give way: instead, the network is back on the rack. \"We were surprised,\" says Hill. \"We thought we had offered a substantial set of changes. But jaw jaw is better than war war. We shall strive to produce acceptable measures.\" Would such an \"acceptable measure\" mean ITV, against its better judgement, opting to head off a damaging row by giving in to the commission's demand for a News at 10.30pm? On that, Hill is silent. Before last week, the ITV companies had stood firm. During a two-hour debate on the issue at ITV's ruling council meeting on May 8, all the companies stuck to their guns, some more solidly than others, united behind the current schedule, which Liddiment argues is working well, and bringing in the crucial younger viewers. The \"honourable compromise\" of a 10.30pm bulletin was rejected, but with Carlton and Granada said to be more hawkish than United News &amp; Media. Now, the ball is back in ITV's court. Urgent meetings have already been held, and Liddiment will be in constant contact over the next week from Los Angeles, where he is viewing up-and-coming US shows. Paul Bonner, who is writing the official history of independent television in Britain - authorised by the ITC - is amazed that it has gone this far. \"It is bizarre. Both sides are in a position of confrontation most would seek to avoid. But people do back themselves into situations.\" Should ITV refuse to compromise, arguing that technically it is meeting licence requirements to provide high-quality news in peak time, the ITC could use two regulatory weapons. First, it could cancel the variation in the ITV licences it granted in November 1998, which allowed ITV to move News at Ten. This is something of a blunt instrument, however, and the ITC does not see this as a viable option, even though it would delight government ministers, who believe 10.30pm is still too late for news. As a back-up, the ITC is looking to the catch-all wording in the broadcasting act which requires ITV to provide \"such services which taken as a whole are of high quality\". This would allow the ITC to order a judicial review in the high court. But does it dare go to law? The high court option would be the equivalent of pressing the nuclear button. A judicial review would throw the spotlight on the ITC's very purpose: a forensic examination of which would be highly damaging just at the time when the government is considering the whole future of regulation. (The government chose a squad of experts last week to come up with ideas in advance of the communications white paper, expected in the autumn.) The ITC is under threat: there are well-sourced reports that the commission is heading for the axe. In this light, it is easier to understand the commission's delicate position. Politicians want the return of News at Ten, yet the ITC knows that if it attempts seriously to stand up to ITV, it could precipitate its own demise. In so many ways this is an old-fashioned dispute, with politicians on the one side, a modern television network facing the pressures of a multi-media explosion on another, and a nervous and indecisive regulator in the middle. That certainly is the view of advertisers. Graham Duff, chief executive of Zenith Media, says: \"I find it remarkable that the regulator is putting this amount of pressure on ITV. It should be allowed to operate as it sees fit. And as for ordinary people to be told what's good for them to watch, it is deeply insulting.\" Even if ITV, supported by appalled advertisers, is right in its commercial interests in trying to stick with its new schedules, delivering an extra \u00a370m of revenue a year, the timing of the row could not be worse. The growing debate about ITV's public service and regional duties is becoming bound up with a broader debate about media ownership, the consolidation of ITV and future regulation. Sir George Russell, the former chairman of the ITC and the architect of the current detailed licences who gave evidence to the media select committee urging great caution in ending News at Ten, says: \"The ITC must insist they get the local news right. The fundamental thing is that the change in news is undermining the regional news provision. ITV is designed as a federal organisation. We always knew takeovers would take place but the 15 franchises would remain. Anyone involved in a takeover would be stuck with honouring those commitments. I know from my contacts that the regional news services are in disarray.\" That is why developments are being watched, open-mouthed, with a mix of enjoyment and horror by the BBC and Channel 4. There is a degree of sympathy for Liddiment - they know how hard it is to change back, or change at all, and that new schedules need time to bed in. But as the white paper approaches, time is running out for ITV. Hill met the culture secretary, Chris Smith, earlier this month to assure him that ITV, despite the defiance over News at Ten, wants to remain a key public service broadcaster, with all the protection that provides. But, as an observer says: \"They are losing credibility, and are coming to be regarded cynically by the government. In normal times, you'd expect the ITC to edge them into a sensible debate. This time, it's combustion. The ITV companies have mishandled it horribly. They have been so defiant in public. They have riled everyone.\" (The decision last week to screen the Queen Mother's 100th birthday pageant, a PR coup handed on a plate by the BBC, was in part seen as an opportunity to ingratiate the network with conservative-minded politicians.) It has become fashionable to allege - though it is disputed as \"rubbish\" by Hill - that ITV lacks leadership. Without a chief executive since Richard Eyre quit last autumn, it has certainly lacked a diplomatic spokesman to finesse its case. But another evident truth is that Granada, Carlton and United News &amp; Media, the three power players, have been distracted by something much bigger and more vital to their interests: merger mania and who will emerge dominant. Last Friday, United was back at the competition commission, which is in the final stages of preparing its report over the United/Carlton merger in which Granada, itself in the throes of demerger, hopes to intervene. Stephen Byers, the trade secretary, receives the report on June 16, a few days before the ITC meets to discuss the news issue again. The competition commission is not concerned, as the ITC must be, about regional news, or News at Ten, but the government is. This is why the messy compromise of a 10.30pm bulletin may yet win through. The main ITV players, at the end of the day, have much bigger things on their plate. And, like it not, they need a benign government to nod things through.",

We were all threatened with disciplinary action by our employer, Thames, for discussing in public sensitive regulatory issues, and the IBA ignored us. </p> <p>Eventually, LWT abandoned Weekend World. Since 1992, ITV has also dropped This Week, First Tuesday and even World in Action (not to mention News at Ten), claiming they were either outmoded, irrelevant to the audience, or inhibiting ITV's commercial success. Since 1992, ITV's audience share has diminished from 41% to 30% despite the addition to the schedule of more soap episodes and Who Wants To Be a Millionaire? </p> <p>But that is commercial television. How can a publicly funded broadcaster take the axe to its own current affairs flagship without provoking more than a smidgeon of protest? Yet 10 days ago, the editor of Panorama went public with the news that the run of the series would be reduced from 38 to 30, with the justification that \"the same amount of programme budget will be targeted on a reduced number of higher profile films\". </p> <p>Peter Horrocks is a talented editor, and - I am sure - an honourable man. He must surely have argued to his own superiors that there was another course of action open to them. That if the diagnosis was that Panorama editions were under-funded and under-researched (as Monday's feeble effort on football TV rights suggested), then surely the correct response was to bring all 38 editions up to the new budget level for 30 editions. That the cost of this injection of funds into the BBC's single most important programme would be less than \u00a31m. That there could be few other ways of spending \u00a31m - even the coverage planned for the Queen Mother's birthday - that would more vividly demonstrate the case for public funding of television, the licence fee and the BBC. That this \u00a31m represented 0.0004% of the BBC's public funding. That a current affairs series on air for only 30 weeks of the year was crucially undermined in its ability to manage a mix of topical and long-range stories. That in the age of \"always-on\" broadband and 24-hour news, such a downsizing for Panorama - after previously having its length cut and its slot twice shunted down the schedule - was a dangerous step towards final extinction. </p> <p>One can only assume that Horrocks's superiors heard and discounted these arguments. Perhaps the grant of an extra \u00a3300,000 for the overall Panorama budget - the equivalent of one episode of the journalistically vapid MacIntyre Undercover - was deemed a price worth paying to buy off staff hostility and eliminate eight ratings dips in the BBC1 Monday schedule. </p> <p>No doubt the director-general (the man who axed Weekend World when he was at ITV) and perhaps even the governors were kept informed. It is even possible that the word \"dinosaur\" was uttered - though Horrocks would surely have riposted that the dinosaurs actually lasted far longer than homo sapiens have so far managed. </p> <p>Sadly, most media attention relating to the BBC last week was concentrated on its withdrawal from covering the Queen Mother's parade and on its failure to offer an edition of Grandstand on Saturday. With so many newspapers competing to bash the BBC, it is remarkable how little attention was paid to the crucial Panorama announcement. Perhaps those enemies of publicly funded broadcasting so relished such a dismal retreat from the corporation's duties that they preferred not to drive the BBC into making good its error. </p> <p>In the 70s and 80s, the main current affairs series were on for up to 46 weeks a year. This kept their journalism sharp and maximised the flexibility for slotting long-range investigations into the run. The old Panorama - or World in Action - would surely last Monday have covered the story of the Unionist response to the IRA's arms initiative. </p> <p>It is not the job of current affairs series to win ratings, but to keep the audience informed. If Peter Salmon is worried about his Monday audience levels, it is his 9.30pm drama, not Panorama at 10pm, that he needs to fix. Whoever took that shameful decision, it should not be Peter Horrocks who has to justify it with weasel words and transparently inadequate logic.</p> <p>\u0095 David Elstein is chief executive of Channel 5.</p>",

That if the diagnosis was that Panorama editions were under-funded and under-researched (as Monday's feeble effort on football TV rights suggested), then surely the correct response was to bring all 38 editions up to the new budget level for 30 editions. That the cost of this injection of funds into the BBC's single most important programme would be less than \u00a31m. That there could be few other ways of spending \u00a31m - even the coverage planned for the Queen Mother's birthday - that would more vividly demonstrate the case for public funding of television, the licence fee and the BBC. That this \u00a31m represented 0.0004% of the BBC's public funding. That a current affairs series on air for only 30 weeks of the year was crucially undermined in its ability to manage a mix of topical and long-range stories. That in the age of \"always-on\" broadband and 24-hour news, such a downsizing for Panorama - after previously having its length cut and its slot twice shunted down the schedule - was a dangerous step towards final extinction. One can only assume that Horrocks's superiors heard and discounted these arguments. Perhaps the grant of an extra \u00a3300,000 for the overall Panorama budget - the equivalent of one episode of the journalistically vapid MacIntyre Undercover - was deemed a price worth paying to buy off staff hostility and eliminate eight ratings dips in the BBC1 Monday schedule. No doubt the director-general (the man who axed Weekend World when he was at ITV) and perhaps even the governors were kept informed. It is even possible that the word \"dinosaur\" was uttered - though Horrocks would surely have riposted that the dinosaurs actually lasted far longer than homo sapiens have so far managed. Sadly, most media attention relating to the BBC last week was concentrated on its withdrawal from covering the Queen Mother's parade and on its failure to offer an edition of Grandstand on Saturday. With so many newspapers competing to bash the BBC, it is remarkable how little attention was paid to the crucial Panorama announcement. Perhaps those enemies of publicly funded broadcasting so relished such a dismal retreat from the corporation's duties that they preferred not to drive the BBC into making good its error. In the 70s and 80s, the main current affairs series were on for up to 46 weeks a year. This kept their journalism sharp and maximised the flexibility for slotting long-range investigations into the run. The old Panorama - or World in Action - would surely last Monday have covered the story of the Unionist response to the IRA's arms initiative. It is not the job of current affairs series to win ratings, but to keep the audience informed. If Peter Salmon is worried about his Monday audience levels, it is his 9.30pm drama, not Panorama at 10pm, that he needs to fix. Whoever took that shameful decision, it should not be Peter Horrocks who has to justify it with weasel words and transparently inadequate logic. \u0095 David Elstein is chief executive of Channel 5.",

For US farmers, it\u00eas good business. The supermarkets there are the same. They now buy in extra food just so that they can give it away, earning PR points. It\u00eas sick, really.

But we have a really weird system here where almost 70 per cent of all our food is sold through four or five chains which also control (to a large extent) what the farmers grow. Food is dead cheap in the US because there's more genuine competition and because it's industrially farmed on a scale that is unimaginable here (biggest pig farm here about 10,000 animals, in the US 1 million or more). But if, say, Walmart managed to get a semi monopoly going in the US - just as our chums have here - than you can bet your dollars the prices would rise.

They\u00eare pretty draconian and well policed. The trouble is that charities often don\u00eat have the money to invest in huge refrigeration units or refrigerated vans to cart the food around in. So there are very few who are trying to do it. </p> <br> <p> <b>kevinroper2000:</b> Increasing the cost of waste disposal to the company would surely lead to a reduction in the amount of waste produced.

One reason they were added to this crew was the experience Usachev has living aboard the Russian Mir space station - more than a year - where he became familiar with electrical systems similar to those now malfunctioning on the Russian-built Zarya module of the International Space Station. By that time they return to the space station early next year, the Russian Space Agency is scheduled to add a third major component, a service module with living quarters and life-support that will be needed to make the station inhabitable.

      "body": "<b>Dear Alex,</b> <br> The Sierra Leone fiasco reinforces a lesson the UN should have learned years ago but is still shamefully reluctant to accept: if there isn't a peace, you can't keep it - and the attempt to keep non-existent peaces is not merely a waste of time, but carries a huge risk of exacerbating the very conflicts the peacekeepers were meant to help resolve. There is a place for UN monitoring, where the parties to a conflict have reached a genuine settlement, backed by their dispositions on the ground, which the intervening force can help guarantee. Sierra Leone had no more than a bogus settlement, reminiscent of Angola in 1991-92, or worse, Rwanda in 1993-94: paper agreements between bitterly hostile adversaries. UN peacekeepers were sent in, though neither side had disarmed, and one side had accepted the agreement mostly to gain a breathing space in which to strengthen its position. Providing such a space only makes things worse. In Rwanda, the Arusha accords gave hardliners in the government the opportunity to organise genocide. Sierra Leone is similar: the Lom* agreement of May 1999, into which the Kabbah government was pressured by the UN and others, ostensibly established a coalition between an ineffectual elected government and a ruthless armed opposition with a record of reneging on agreements. The peacekeepers sent in to police it were so poorly armed that hundreds could be rounded up as soon as the war resumed. It is open to the UN to send real fighting forces into situations like Sierra Leone, to kill and be killed, if the states concerned allow it. That would be a very hazardous enterprise, and unlikely to lead to the reconstruction of Sierra Leone. But at least the UN would have some idea of what it was supposed to be doing. Peacekeeping as seen in recent conflicts is a farce fuelled by wishful thinking. We'd be better off without it. Yours sincerely, <br> Christopher Clapham <br> Professor of politics and International relations, Lancaster University <br> <br> <p><b>Dear Christopher,</b><br><br> I acknowledge your reservations about fragile peace agreements: the Lom* agreement was seriously flawed. But the UK and US were primary influences in initiating Lom*; the UN was fully aware of its weaknesses. Traditional peace-keeping is often inapplicable to internal wars, but the UN has been trying to develop appropriate responses to such emergencies. It is the unwillingness of the more powerful UN member states, not least the five permanent members of the Security Council, to provide sufficient resources for an operation's effectiveness that is the problem. Perhaps a lesson can be learned from East Timor last year, where the May agreement providing for a referendum to decide the province's future status was deeply flawed: the Indonesian authorities insisted upon guaranteeing security. It was inadequate UN involvement that allowed gross human rights abuses against the East Timorese people before, and especially after, the vote. Only then was the international community convinced to provide a proper input. No one can pretend that the referendum process was an unqualified success, nor that UN involvement has been smooth. But there at least appears to have been progress, which could not have occurred without the UN. Peace processes are delicate, dynamic and risky. It is difficult to persuade the international community to prepare effective contingencies until it is too late. Meanwhile, people continue to live (or die) in misery while the international community prevaricates. The responsibility lies with UN member states, particularly those in the Security Council, to provide operations with sufficient resources to reduce the risks, including strengthening peace agreements in the first place.<br><br> Yours sincerely,<br> Alex Ramsbotham<br> Head, UN and conflict unit, United Nations Association, UK<br><br></p> <p><b>Dear Alex,</b><br><br> I do not agree the failings of the UN can be separated from those of its member states, least of all the permanent members of the Security Council. The UN is an assembly of states; its strengths and weaknesses are reflected in those of its leading members. Their reluctance to provide resources for peacekeeping, most of all to risk troops, is a reality derived from bitter experience, notably that of the US in Somalia. I do not believe that many conflicts can be resolved through external intervention. East Timor, like Namibia a decade earlier, was a crisis to which a clear, acceptable solution could be found, through the simple mechanism of independence validated by an internationally supervised election. Crises like those in Somalia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone or Congo are not like that. These are fundamentally internal wars which can only be resolved internally: either by one combatant securing supremacy, or through a compromise in which each party recognises a settlement. Bodged settlements only delay, and often prevent, this resolution. Either the force brought in to monitor them packs up at the first sign of trouble, or it gets dragged into a long-term commitment in which its own role is compromised, and its costs escalate - not least in lives. The UN must acknowledge its limitations, and avoid getting dragged into conflicts it cannot resolve and in which its involvement can only damage its credibility and the welfare of those it is trying to help.<br><br> Yours sincerely,<br> Christopher<br><br></p> <p><b>Dear Christopher,</b><br><br> I cannot agree that external intervention is inappropriate to internal wars; nor are they ever really internal for very long. It cannot be assumed that a lack of intervention will accelerate resolution. In Sudan, a highly destructive war has been continuing despite international involvement being limited to diplomacy, non-military humanitarian aid and development assistance; Somalia, since the UN's withdrawal, is no nearer stability. Military victory does not guarantee peace: in Afghanistan, the Taliban is not renowned for respecting human rights. This does not assume that forcible military intervention is desirable: it is costly in human and financial terms and ineffective. Some of the UN's best (but least public) achievements have been through preventive action, such as the pre-emptive deployment in Macedonia. I accept that bodged peace agreements are unsatisfactory and urge the international community to increase preventive efforts, especially through the UN. But where military intervention is necessary to protect life and promote stability, it must be undertaken, even if it requires a long-term commitment by the international community.<br><br> Yours sincerely,<br> Alex<br><br></p> <p><b>Dear Alex,</b><br><br> I feel we are on similar ground: we both recognise and support the obligation of the international community, acting through the UN, to do what it can to resolve conflicts in which internal and external elements are often impossible to distinguish. There is a role for peacekeeping forces and preventive action. But we differ over something more important. You believe that the world is ultimately controllable: that the UN, backed by the leading members of the Security Council, can, with sufficient goodwill and determination, police an international system in which viable states are maintained, governments are stabilised, and basic respect for human rights is assured. Sadly, I cannot agree, and the cases that you cite - including Afghanistan and Somalia - make it clear why not. The long-term commitment by the international community would involve the imposition of a new colonialism enforced by the armies of industrial states. It would also be impossible: no amount of commitment (which in practice translates into \"no number of dead soldiers\") is going to protect life and promote stability. It can only promote further instability, as it did when the Russians intervened in Afghanistan and the Americans in Somalia. No matter how tragic the loss of life, and how appalling the abuse of rights, the UN and its leading states must recognise the limitations on their capacities, and come to terms as best they can with a world that they cannot control. They must resist the temptation to send peacekeepers into situations where they add to the number of victims of the UN's naivety and overambition.<br><br> Sincerely,<br> Christopher<br><br></p> <p><b>Dear Christopher,</b><br><br> I'm pleased we agree on the need for increasing the focus on preventive action. But the fact that conflict prevention is at present so inadequate suggests there are situations where more emergency measures are required. I think we can distinguish between the neo-imperialist imposition of western ideals and the obligations of richer, more stable countries to uphold their responsibilities to poorer or less stable states, whose predicament we have often had a significant role in creating. One would hope local people would lead the way in designing models for governance. I agree that attempts by the UN, or anyone else, to intervene in evidently unsuitable circumstances are likely to be counterproductive. The UN has been very cautious in its approach to the Congo, although much greater (not necessarily military) international assistance might help to ameliorate the situation. In Sierra Leone, much more could have been done much earlier to address the grotesque behaviour of the RUF and improve the circumstances surrounding Lom*. But while acknowledging the input of UN peacekeepers, the improved circumstances since the arrival of highly efficient, well-resourced British troops demonstrates the effect such support can have. It's precisely the uncontrollable nature of the world that warrants some forum for global management, not only in security terms. The UN was established in the wake of two world wars to counter the massive destruction that accompanied such inter-state conflicts. The changing nature of war can be seen as a consequence of some success in the UN*s original raison d'etre. The problems that it is experiencing with internal conflict is a reason to make stronger efforts rather than to disengage.<br><br> Sincerely,<br> Alex<br><br> </p> <p><b> Useful Links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.una-uk.org/\">UK United Nations Association</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.lancs.ac.uk/users/politics/people/clapham.htm  \"> Christopher Clapham's page</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sierra/0,2759,218616,00.html\">Guardian special report on Sierra Leone</a></p>",

He set new standards in the playing of the artificial high comedy of Congreve, Wilde and Sheridan to which he brought the breath of naturalness. He revelled in suave villainy and hauteur, in the elegantly drawn out repartee of these periods, sometimes deliciously parodying aspect of his tragic demeanour and voice. He was in his glorious element playing doomed heroes and dandies, neurotics and aesthetes. </p> <p>As a source of inspiration and influence upon his profession he was unrivalled by any actor in his time except for Laurence Olivier. For, in youth and middle age alike, Gielgud was a modern pioneer working to fulfil the actor's dream of working in a permanent ensemble, performing plays of high quality where profit was neither motive nor stimulus. So the famous companies of first-class actors, designers and directors that Sir John formed and acted with in his historic seasons in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s became inspirational blue prints for ensembles like the Royal Shakespeare and National Theatre companies years later.</p> <p>The other astonishing aspect of Gielgud's awesomely long career, which spanned more than 75 years, lay in his ability triumphantly to recreate and extend himself as fashion and circumstance demanded. He was socially and politically conservative. As an exquisite raconteur and conversationalist, scattering his aper\u00e7us, indiscretions and gossip with gay abandon he may have been the acme of unconventionality. But theatrically speaking the shock of the new often did shock him. Since he was also a restless seeker, he learned to rise above the prejudice of his first impressions and to cast aside hide-bound convictions.</p> <p>In the 1950s when the new wave of dramatists broke excitedly upon the London theatre, when Bertolt Brecht and theatre of the absurd began to threaten the hold of the upper-middle class drawing room comedy and the regimen of the well-made play, Gielgud was at first left bothered and bewildered, though he did confess himself thrilled by Osborne's Look Back in Anger and Pinter's The Caretaker. Unlike Peggy Ashcroft and Laurence Olivier he did not join the avant-garde at the Royal Court in the 1950s and by the early 1960s he was beginning to look a thoroughly traditional figure, marching in time with the derriere garde.</p> <p>This isolation from the new theatrical movement did not, however, last that long. Gielgud adjusted, adapted and learned. Critics and commentators have suggested he discovered an ideal point of mediation between the old theatre and the new with Alan Bennett's 1968 Forty Years On, a revue-like play which regards the totems of England's early 20th-century society with a mixture of mockery and nostalgia. But in fact John's Broadway performance four years earlier, as a lay brother laid low after being persuaded to marry the richest man in the world in Edward Albee's mystifyingly symbolic Tiny Alice marked the point at which he threw in his famous lot with the nouvelle vague.</p> <p>From then on his theatrical career revived. Performances in the plays of Edward Bond, Charles Wood, and most memorably as Spooner in Pinter's No Man's Land and one of the old inmates of Home from Home followed. </p> <p>It was in this phase, too, that he began to disprove the old slur that he was only able to give a single performance in one voice. In No Man's Land, his sly and slovenly literary vagrant in search of a billet - the model of bohemian seediness with a cigarette forever between his lips - he cast off the familiar Gielgud persona as thoroughly as he did for his 1936 Merchant of Venice and the 1961 Othello.</p> <p>When his ability to memorise parts for the theatre began to falter in his mid-seventies, while playing, in Julian Mitchell's Half Life, an archaeologist disturbed by excavations into his own past - Gielgud turned to the world of film, which unlike Olivier, Richardson and Redgrave he had largely ignored. He adapted his personality and his style to the medium and fashioned an indian summer career - notably as the conductor-hero of Resnais' Providence, an all-embracing, ancient Prospero conveyed in Peter Greenaway's astonishing version of The Tempest. He delighted in the suave malice of the narrator's father in the famous television version of Bridehead Revisited as well. These were indian summer triumphs which confounded the idea that elderly theatre actors have nothing to offer except their memories.</p> <p>There was also a last stage performance. At the age of 84 he took on the role of Sir Sydney Cokerell, the museum curator in Hugh Whitemore's Best of Friends, and had a field day with the character's mellow urbanity. Even in his nineties, though vocally reduced and restricted, he capered nimbly through the musical reaches of Shine.</p> <p>The essential Gielgud did not greatly change from first maturity to old age - his capacity for speaking his mind at the wrong time in the wrong way was a life-long joy for all except those who suffered the cold blast of truth. When he visited the mildly ailing Emlyn Williams one day in the 60s, he took his leave abruptly after an hour. \"When I visit the sick I always stay too long, I sat for ages with poor Arthur Macrae, but I was glad I'd been. He died next day.\"</p> <p>Arthur John Gielgud may have been born into the heart of the conventional upper middle classes of Edwardian England. But this third child of an Edwardian stock-broker had the theatre in his blood and his family tree positively blossomed with actors. On his mother's side he was directly descended from the 19th-century theatrical aristocracy - the Terry family. Ellen Terry, Irving's leading lady and the late Victorian theatre's prime actress was his great aunt. His grandmother Kate played Cordelia at 14 and became an instant star. His great uncle Fred Terry, made his name with the Scarlet Pimpernel and nothing else.</p> <p>This Terry connection may be quite misleading. Some people convincingly have argued that Gielgud's acting and looks bore no trace of his Terry ancestors. They suggest Sir John style of acting bears the imprint of his father's Lithuanian forbears, and of his thespian Polish great grandparents who were renowned for their Shakespearian acting. Certainly, even in his thirties, Gielgud - remarkable for his great, domed forehead and aquiline nose - did not look English. Ronald Harwood has convincingly suggested that \"the fusion of the Anglo Saxon and the Slav to be one of the clues to understanding Gielgud's qualities both as an actor and as a man.\"</p> <p>Stage-struck and star struck in a childhood during which the \"nervous, frail and sensitive\" tags were attached to him, he became a willowy young man - quick and sharp with a butterfly mind, who liked to dress in silk socks, broadband black hats and with fluffy hair which barbers used to wave. He had played no school games and walked in stiff self-consciousness - \"like a cat with rickets\" said one of his first drama teachers. There was nothing outstandingly masculine about him. In a theatre which celebrated bluff maleness and matter-of-fact understatement from its leading actors it would have seemed he was the man least likely to take the West End theatre at all, let alone by storm.</p> <p>When he played his first leading role in London as Romeo to Gwen Ffrancgon Davies's Juliet in 1924 the critics were loud in their scorn. \"Scant of virility,\" accused Ivor Brown, \"with the most meaningless legs imaginable.\" But perhaps the \"orange\" make up, coal-black centre-parted wig and white tights did not help much.</p> <p>It may have been his little known Slavic heritage that saved him from sinking after this. For it was in the then almost unknown Anton Checkhov that Gielgud made his name. \"Perfection itself,\" said James Agate, the most influential critic of the period about his Trofimov, the young trevolutionary in The Cherry Orchard. His Kontantin in The Seagull and the doomed Tusenbach in, remarkably, the first English production of The Three Sisters were almost as eye-catching.</p> <p>So it was that the 25-year-old John Gielgud arrived at the Old Vic at the end of the 1920s as leading man and walked almost straight into theatrical history. In the next 19 months he worked fantastically without more than a flicker of strain, taking on more Shakespeare leads than any subsequent actor has attempted in twice the time. He was all ages and all types - Romeo and Lear, Orlando and Prospero, Macbeth and Malvolio, Antony and Benedick. One of these roles, his Richard II - \"A tall willowy figure in black velvet.. the pale agonised face set beneath a glittering crown,\" was the making of him. </p> <p>Critics had already remarked upon Gielgud's voice, that fabulous piece of machinery which a few detractors have claimed to be capable of making vocal music and little more. The old records of Gielgud's stage roles disprove that charge. They reveal him as master architect, building and shaping character minutely. In Shakespeare he composed a serious intellectual music. His grief-struck Richard, riddled with hauteur and vulnerability, showed up both Gielgud's Slavic and Anglo Saxon aspects - his monarch was a beautiful lover, struggling to keep his emotions in check.</p> <p>The Hamlet that followed was more remarkable still - a Prince for all seasons, contemporary in its sense of disgust and outrage instead of traditional ponderous nobility, fresh in its Oedipal stresses and strains. It was, for an age accustomed to mature 40-something Hamlets, disconcertingly young. It was for an age familiar with understatement riven with emotion, \"hysteria and self-lacerating sensitivity.\" James Agate called it \"the highwater mark of English Shakesperian acting in our time.\"</p> <p>Four years later his second Prince - bringing Shakespeare daringly into the West End - was less hysterical, more thoughtful and prone to flashes of humour. It was even more feted. The critic J C Trewin, writing half a century later said it was the best of the 70 Princes he had seen in his long theatre going time. And even when Gielgud played the role in his forties the likes of the youthful John Mortimer were bowled over all over again.</p> <p>It was, however, in a new, slight costume piece about Richard II - Gordon Daviot's Richard of Bordeaux - that Gielgud really became a West End star. \"Yes I know it's vulgar, but I can't resist,\" he said to a friend as he sat signing picture postcards of himself after a performance. It was a mark of Gielgud's essential seriousness that he did not succumb to the frippery and shallowness of the 1930s West End. Instead, supported by the impresario Bronson Albery, he set about creating his own company of players in classical drama in St Martins Lane.</p> <p>It was typical of his eagerness to encourage the new that he cast the young Laurence Olivier to alternate with him the roles of Romeo and Mercutio to Peggy Ashcroft's Juliet. It was not supposed to be a theatrical contest. But so it proved and Olivier, unsurprisingly, was a love-possessed Romeo from the finger tips to the heart and other more dangerous partswhile Gielgud's Romeo was all surface and no sensuality. When it came to Mercutio, however, Olivier was second-bested. \"John's extraordinary darting imagination made him the better,\" Ashcroft said.</p> <p>Gielgud may have felt pangs of jealousy but they never loomed large - he was always far more of a team player than Olivier, and far more willing to test himself against his best contemporaries than Sir Laurence ever was. So Sir John's dandyish Trigorin to Edith Evans's grand dame Arkadina a year later was reckoned by the critics of the day to be too unstarry. But Gielgud was not interested in projecting himself in that luminous way. </p> <p>His famous 1937 season at the Queens, with Peggy Ashcroft as his leading lady, and a repertoire of Richard II, The Merchant of Venice, The School for Scandal and The Three Sisters, directed by Michel Denis, marked his second attempt to create an ensemble of classical players. But then, tiring of the producer's role, Gielgud was diverted by Binkie Beaumont, who was about to become the most powerful of London impresarios, into a Dodie Smith drawing room romance.</p> <p>Beaumont, an uneducated man who was admired for his way with stars and urivalled capacity to assemble handsome revivals of classics, was a mixed blessing in Gielgud's career. Gielgud always oscillated between the radical and the conventional. He worked with directorial pioneers like Komisarjevsky , Michel St Denis, Tyrone Guthrie and Peter Brook, but was always liable to succumb to the call of Beaumont offering him some old-fashioned new play.</p> <p>At least under Beaumont aegis he was given the chance of launching a bold 1945 season at the Haymarket which might have been designed to show the ease with which he scaled both the heights of tragedy and comedy. There was his fourth Hamlet and the abominably cruel Ferdinand in The Duchess of Malfi, ranged with what the fledgling critic Kenneth Tynan delightedly called his \"tongue-in-cheek and hand-on-heart Valentine in Love for Love.\" </p> <p>In 1953 Beaumont gave him another chance - at the Lyric, Hammersmith - to run his own classical company again. Astutely choosing Paul Scofield as his co-star Gielgud resuscitated Thomas Otway's tremendous restoration tragedy, playing the role of the wracked Jaffier in a dazzle of torment and nobility.</p> <p>In the 1940s Gielgud consolidated more than he advanced. He was more larch than oak when he played an admired, too youthful Lear, an unwarrior-like Macbeth and a new Italianate Prospero. But there were people who criticised what someone called his \"divine coldness\" - it was as if there were something remote and aloof about his acting.</p> <p>These reservations were set aside in his annus mirabilis at Stratford on Avon in 1950 when he cast aside inhibition and intraversion. His fire and ice Angelo in Peter Brook's Measure for Measure astonished everyone. He was no longer courting sympathy or exuding an easy romanticism. He and Peggy Ashcroft turned Much Ado about Nothing into an exquisite war of words. Anthony Quayle directing him as Cassius in Julius Caesar persuaded him to do away with lyricism and softness and Gielgud achieved a pugilistic fury that astonished the critics who were not quite as thrilled by a harsh, hard Lear. His Leontes in Peter Brook's A Winter's Tale confirmed his new found confidence in playing unsympathetic roles. \"Dressed in hectic red, tall and tortured and rigid he commands the bare black stage like a fury,\" John Barber wrote.</p> <p>A year later, in the Coronation honours, he was awarded a long delayed knighthood for which Olivier and Richardson had had to lobby the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill. Gielgud's homosexuality, which was a well known fact of life within the theatrical profession, had been the bar to this honour. Then irony and disaster struck in a double action. Just a few months later, when the government was in the midst of a witch hunt against homosexuality and homosexuals, Sir John was charged with persistently importuning for immoral purposes. He admitted his guilt and was fined.</p> <p>The repercussions were great and awful for a man of Gielgud's temperament and character. It was said he briefly contemplated suicide. \"You can't imagine what it was like,\" he said to me years later. But in his weeks of stress and humiliation much of the generosity and kindness that he had shown to his fellow actors was returned in full measure. Sybil Thorndike, who was acting with him in A Day by the Sea, led those determined to give support. A move made by a minority on the Equity Council to have him expelled from the Union - and thereby barred from acting - was defeated by a large majority.</p> <p>For a time the case may have turned Gielgud back to the safe, reassuring old world of Binkie Beaumont and HM Tennent. But not for long. His surreal, space age Lear in 1956 was the quintessence of experiment. A year later his \"grizzled ascetic\" Prospero, in whom the fires of revenge and recrimination still blazed brought an outburst of applause. \"It's the best Shakespearian acting I have seen,\" Richardson wrote to him. And even though miscast as Othello in Zeffirelli's Royal Shakespeare company production, with a 1961 first night rich in falling scenery and collapsing reputations, Gielgud emerged not that much scathed from the disaster to play a delectable Gayev in The Cherry Orchard - all wistful solemnity as he lightly mocked his own pompousness.</p> <p>This ability to ignore set-back and disappointment, to rise to new challenges characterised the last 20 years of his life in the theatre. He may have had too few chances to play the classics - his last Lear was given when he was little more than 50; his final, necromancing Prospero was something of a come-down. His Julius Caesar and Sir Politick would be unremarkable. But there were at least two great performances. In Home, as a mental patient with nothing left to look forward to but the keeping up of appearances, Gielgud was sheer magic: voice maintaining a false air of patrician calm, while tears streamed down. His Spooner in Pinter's No Man's Land was even more of a departure. It marked a feat of self disguise and impersonation that he had not attempted since his early acting days. Seedily dishevelled, with an air of chronic scruffiness, Gielgud prowled through the action slyly on the make and the look-out, eyes behind gold rimmed glasses registering next to nothing, that velvet voice relishing its grand insincerities.</p> <p>John Gielgud served the stage unstintingly. He was a master of acting in an age of great English actors. He was not versatile in Olivier's chameleon fashion. But in his acting he encompassed everything from the tragic to the comic ridiculous. He was so old and had worked so long that there will be hardly anyone left alive who can remember our theatre without his magic presence. Those who knew him even a little will lament the passing not just of the actor but the man who was such infinite, mischievous fun. But preserved on disc and cassette, in infinite recorded conversations, there will always remain the essential glimmerings of his rare, bright star.</p> <p>\u2022 Arthur John Gielgud, actor, born 14 April 1904; died 21 May 2000</p>",

      "bodyText": "John Gielgud, who has died aged 96, blazed a glorious trail through the English theatre of the 20th century and left an indelible imprint upon it. He was the first classical actor of his generation to discard antique modes of Shakespearean interpretation and performance. His Hamlet, Richard II, Leontes, Angelo, Lear and Prospero were acclaimed as thrilling recoveries and discoveries of roles on which the dreariness of convention had long since settled in handfuls of star-dust. \"You have to spin it out of yourself, like a spider. It is the only way,\" he said in 1961, and not until extreme old age did he lose that air of effortless spider-like facility. He was not, however just the starriest actor for high strung, tragic heroes half in love with painful suffering, deploying that famous tenor voice of his which Alec Guinness once nicely apostrophised as being \"like a silver trumpet muffled in silk\". He set new standards in the playing of the artificial high comedy of Congreve, Wilde and Sheridan to which he brought the breath of naturalness. He revelled in suave villainy and hauteur, in the elegantly drawn out repartee of these periods, sometimes deliciously parodying aspect of his tragic demeanour and voice.

Just a few months later, when the government was in the midst of a witch hunt against homosexuality and homosexuals, Sir John was charged with persistently importuning for immoral purposes. He admitted his guilt and was fined. The repercussions were great and awful for a man of Gielgud's temperament and character. It was said he briefly contemplated suicide. \"You can't imagine what it was like,\" he said to me years later. But in his weeks of stress and humiliation much of the generosity and kindness that he had shown to his fellow actors was returned in full measure. Sybil Thorndike, who was acting with him in A Day by the Sea, led those determined to give support. A move made by a minority on the Equity Council to have him expelled from the Union - and thereby barred from acting - was defeated by a large majority. For a time the case may have turned Gielgud back to the safe, reassuring old world of Binkie Beaumont and HM Tennent. But not for long. His surreal, space age Lear in 1956 was the quintessence of experiment. A year later his \"grizzled ascetic\" Prospero, in whom the fires of revenge and recrimination still blazed brought an outburst of applause. \"It's the best Shakespearian acting I have seen,\" Richardson wrote to him. And even though miscast as Othello in Zeffirelli's Royal Shakespeare company production, with a 1961 first night rich in falling scenery and collapsing reputations, Gielgud emerged not that much scathed from the disaster to play a delectable Gayev in The Cherry Orchard - all wistful solemnity as he lightly mocked his own pompousness. This ability to ignore set-back and disappointment, to rise to new challenges characterised the last 20 years of his life in the theatre. He may have had too few chances to play the classics - his last Lear was given when he was little more than 50; his final, necromancing Prospero was something of a come-down. His Julius Caesar and Sir Politick would be unremarkable. But there were at least two great performances. In Home, as a mental patient with nothing left to look forward to but the keeping up of appearances, Gielgud was sheer magic: voice maintaining a false air of patrician calm, while tears streamed down. His Spooner in Pinter's No Man's Land was even more of a departure. It marked a feat of self disguise and impersonation that he had not attempted since his early acting days. Seedily dishevelled, with an air of chronic scruffiness, Gielgud prowled through the action slyly on the make and the look-out, eyes behind gold rimmed glasses registering next to nothing, that velvet voice relishing its grand insincerities. John Gielgud served the stage unstintingly. He was a master of acting in an age of great English actors. He was not versatile in Olivier's chameleon fashion. But in his acting he encompassed everything from the tragic to the comic ridiculous. He was so old and had worked so long that there will be hardly anyone left alive who can remember our theatre without his magic presence. Those who knew him even a little will lament the passing not just of the actor but the man who was such infinite, mischievous fun. But preserved on disc and cassette, in infinite recorded conversations, there will always remain the essential glimmerings of his rare, bright star. \u2022 Arthur John Gielgud, actor, born 14 April 1904; died 21 May 2000",

      "body": "<p>In the background to the lifelong role she played as the queen of love, there was one story which always haunted Dame Barbara Cartland, who has died aged 98. In telling it, she gave away much about herself.</p> <p>It was about a poor-born but dazzlingly beautiful woman, slightly older than herself, who married young into the aristocracy and went to Paris to buy clothes. There she fell in love with another man, ruinously for her marriage, social position and finances. \"She was ecstatically, completely overwhelmed by it,\" Cartland said, \"as only a rather stupid woman can be.\"</p> <p>Privately, Cartland was never stupid in that way. Although she claimed her books - more than 600 big-selling romantic novels - told the truth about love, her hearts-and-flowers, virginal romanticism was underlaid by a voracious, hard-working, hard-as-nails commonsense.</p> <p>This quality, more energising than her famous 60-a-day vitamin pills, gave her an active longevity. Long life, coupled with a virtuoso instinct for self-publicity, made her into an upper middle-class monstre sacr\u00e9e . In her mid-nineties she was still producing books (outside of the novels she also wrote biographies, children's stories, radio plays, beauty hints and domestic advice), replying to hundreds of letters by return of post and giving superb value in media interviews, during which she concealed her failing sight and turned her deafness into a fearsome defence against awkward questions. Her last book, a novel entitled Love, Lies and Marriage, was published in 1997.</p> <p>Behind her immensely willed facade was a pathos and perceptible loneliness, though she treated this as an impertinent intruder. In her eighties, she confessed that she had always tended to dislike being touched.</p> <p>The name of her game, begun in an embarrassing childhood of genteel poverty, was keeping up appearances. It was a gallant and - in the old-fashioned sense of the word- gay performance, a class act. Most endearingly, she was the soul of indiscretion. When her step-granddaughter Diana became engaged to Prince Charles, Cartland forecast that she would \"reign forever as the queen of love.\"When, however, the marriage foundered, Dame Barbara said, \"She has never really understood men.\"</p> <p>Her love stories, usually dictated in one-sentence paragraphs, were - though stereotyped - brisk, researched with historical fervour and seldom cloying. Their popularity was genuine and long. In 1995, Essex county libraries had more than 300 of her titles- nearly half her 70-year output- in stock, compared with 208 for her romantic novelist contemporary Ursula Bloom and 27 for her own childhood mentor, Ethel M Dell.</p> <p>Pre-eminent among her five autobiographies is We Danced All Night (1970), shrewd and full of anecdotes. It deserves to stand high as a memoir and source-book of the twenties. She interviewed Marconi, lunched as an ing\u00e9nue with Churchill, Beaverbrook and the scientist FE Smith, bickered with Noel Coward at Deauville and Mountbatten at Broadlands. She lived in interesting times with her ears, eyes and mind open but she never, as her mother had hoped, became an aristocrat except by proxy through her daughter Raine, who achieved it thrice by marriage.</p> <p>Her paternal grandfather, James Cartland, who had a pseudo-Gothic villa in Edgbaston, made his money with a Birmingham brass factory. Her mother's family were Gloucestershire minor landed gentry. The two quarrelling grandfathers failed to agree a marriage settlement, with disastrous consequences. In 1902, James over-extended himself with a railway investment, went bankrupt and blew his brains out.</p> <p>The newlyweds' lifestyle collapsed from a country house with 12 servants to a glorified cottage with two. Cartland's amiable but indigent father Bertie had to travel to shoots by bicycle. But her determined mother, Polly, took as her motto, \"Poor I may be, common I am not\". Through thrift and personality she managed to maintain some of their social cachet.</p> <p>Cartland never forgot that; she modelled herself on her mother, who also lived until the age of 98. When Bertie was killed in the trenches in 1917, they could not afford to buy mourning. \"I have had my coat and skirt dyed black,\" she wrote to her mother, \"Would you like me to get my coat-frock done too?\".</p> <p>This bouncy spirit of make-do-and-mend enabled her to have a London season. Through teaching at a Knightsbridge Sunday school - where she was popular because she cliff-hangingly serialised Bible stories - she gained entry to the tea dance circuit. She got an art student, Norman Hartnell, later the Queen's couturier, to make her dresses free. She was, as she acknowledged, no beauty. Her assets were irrepressible gaiety and \"rather large, surprised eyes.\"</p> <p>She made her first money drawing menu cards for parties and selling paragraphs to gossip columns. In 1923 the first of her romances, Jigsaw, earned her \u00a3200. The News Chronicle review said, \"If this is Mayfair, let me live in Whitechapel.\" Yet, We Danced All Night brings out, better and more compassionately than most other accounts of the period, the part that shell shock, mass bereavement and unemployment played in the brittleness of the 20s.</p> <p>She claimed to have had 46 proposals of marriage. But her first marriage in 1927 was undistinguished, to Sachie McCorquodale, of Cound Hall, Shropshire, who had the government contract to print postal orders. Though he sired Raine, he drank furtively and was unsatisfactory in bed.</p> <p>Finding love letters in his wallet, she sued for divorce. He counter-sued, alleging adultery with his brother Hugh, who had been seen visiting Barbara in her bedroom while he was away. Her advocate, the legendary Sir Patrick Hastings, convinced a jury that this was normal if idiosyncratic behaviour for a lady novelist. But it had been the closest shave of her life. The beaten Sachie retired to hospital for two years with heart trouble.</p> <p>In 1936 she married Hugh. The union, a contented one, produced two sons and lasted till his death from the after-effects of a first world war wound in 1963.</p> <p>The second world war took the lives of both her brothers, Ronald and Tony. Ronald, whom she idolised, had been a One-Nation Tory in the pre-war Churchill faction of the party: Churchill wrote a glowing foreword to her memoir of him.</p> <p>Unbowed, she travelled the country scavenging secondhand wedding dresses for the War Office to give to service brides- a contribution which by itself deserved a damehood, she said. She achieved that title in 1991 and made no secret about how. She said she had lobbied every politician she knew.</p> <p>By the time of Hugh's death, she had written 67 novels. Afterwards her workrate accelerated to 10,000 words a day. Her tempo of interviews also increased, in the reflected glory of Raine's aristocratic marriages. In 1981 she overreached herself by organising with Raine a lucrative tourist operation to exploit Diana's wedding. She was not asked to the ceremony but- though badly hurt- managed to gloss over the snub.</p> <p>The same year she was designated Achiever of the Year by the American furnishing industry for wallpaper and fabric designs. In 1988 Jacques Chirac, mayor of Paris, gave her a gold medal for selling 30m books in France.</p> <p>In 1990 she sent national newspapers her own obituary, bound with pink ribbon. \"I have endured a certain amount of teasing and sometimes ridicule by the press,\" she wrote, \"but I have been shown great kindness.\"</p> <p>In 1994 her butler sold his story to the News of the World. The worst he found to disclose was that she called all her maids Miss Snookeypuss and sometimes slapped them.</p> <p>Her own most apt account of herself came in an interview when she was asked about reincarnation. \"Most people tell you they were Cleopatra or some Queen\", she said, \"I was Scheherazade in the bazaar, telling a story every few minutes\".</p> <p>She is survived by her daughter Raine from her first marriage, and the sons from her second.</p> <p><b> John Ezard</b></p> <p><b> Michael De-la-Noy writes:</b> <br>One of the first people I contacted in 1995 when I was commissioned to write a biography of Mervyn Stockwood was Barbara Cartland, for I realised she and the bishop had known one another.

You're probably lying there with a myriad of grinning faces staring at you (the one with the widest grin is called Uncle Alistair, by the way) wondering how you ended up with such a bum name. Take it from a namesake, it's cooler than you think. Anyway, it could have been worse. Famous parents seem to have some kind of genetic disposition to lumber their kids with toe-curlingly bad names. When you're old enough to read, look up the Geldofs, the Bowies and the Zappas for some light relief.</p> <p>Anyway, you are no doubt gurgling to know were it comes from so let's get the boring history lesson over and done with. In your own case you can thank granddaddy Blair, but the name Leo has a long and varied history. I, for the record, was named after a boy in the film The Go-Between, starring Julie Christie and Alan Bates, although my father still insists I was named after his mainframe computer at work (nice one, dad). The name Leo actually comes from the Latin for the Greek \"Leon\" which means lion. You don't know this yet but lions are big cats from Africa who don't take any nonsense from anyone (when you're old enough, ask to see the Lion King on video, but not the Wizard of Oz). Lions are the untouchables of the savannah which is probably why so many leaders in the past have been called Leo - six emperors of Constantinople and 13 popes. Sounds cooler already, doesn't it?</p> <p>In this country, the name did not become popular until the end of the 19th century when there was a revival of classical names. According to the Registrar General's Indexes of Births, by 1925 eight in 10,000 babies born in England and Wales were named Leo. This dipped to two in every 10,000 born in 1965, before picking up again to six in 10,000 by 1990. Your arrival will no doubt mark a revival of the name but you may as well revel in its exclusivity for the moment.</p> <p>That brings me on to the next point - the implications of carrying a rare name. Being called Leo certainly does help to set you apart from the Charleses, Williams and, er, Tonys. This is useful when you come to experience your first Islington dinner party (ask mummy and daddy) as the forgetfully tipsy host will always be able to remember your name when introducing you to other guests. A rare name isn't so clever in the playground, though, as it is honey to the bee for the school bully. They hate the odd ones out as you will soon discover.</p> <p>Being called Leo is also manna from heaven for that other school pest - the nicknamer. Here are some of the names you will be called: Leo the lion (the oh-so-original favourite by a long way), Leo Peo, Leo Weo, Coolio (after a 90s rapper, so unlikely to bother you) and the dreaded - I can barely say it - Leo Sayer. This last one is important, so take note. Again, a largely forgotten singer but one somehow imbedded into the national psyche.</p> <p>You should be OK on visits to the US and Europe though as there the name is far more common (but beware daddy putting an acute on the \"e\" in your name when he is in Europe talking up integration). However, you will still be asked, \"So then, what's Leo short for - Leonard, Leon, Leonardo, Leopold?\" Grit your teeth, smile, then reply, \"Nothing, just Leo\". My mother insists that she thought the name Leo would be foolproof when it came to abbreviations being a three-letter word. She didn't figure on my other pet hate - being called \"Lee\".</p> <p>As you can see, little Leo, having our name has its good and bad points but there is one I have yet to warn you about - being named after a starsign. These are a mystifying part of our culture but nonetheless important as women are seemingly transfixed by them. All I can say is that you should have some stock responses at hand when women ask you if your starsign is actually Leo. It's always a good subject to kick off the conversation with.</p>",

      "body": "<p>When politicians want to ingratiate themselves with the electorate they are pictured kissing a baby; not a small child or a little old lady, but an infant. The association with a tiny, weeny, cooing, gurgling little babbakinsy-poos has a special power. </p> <p>Tony Blair has pulled off a spectacular variation of this political stunt. Not only can he now show off his baby son, he can do so in the run- up to an election. This is particularly desirable for a prime minister who, despite his popularity, has never really been loved or lovable. </p> <p>But what is most interesting of all is that no one - not even the most hardened of cynical political pundits - seems to doubt that the arrival of Blair Minimus will be a huge electoral asset, adding poll percentage points. No other life event would have the same effect on a politician's standing; not getting married, not being cured of a terrible illness, not even being in charge of the nation when winning the World Cup. </p> <p>The appeal of the little blighters seems to have exploded just lately, extending beyond the traditional domain of women into the lap or on to the shoulder of men, not all of them New. Take Dennis Wise, a man not known for his maternal, caring sharing ways. When he went up to collect the FA Cup on Saturday he stopped off to pick up his tiny infant. Astonishingly, we Chelsea supporters witnessed the implicit message that winning the cup was less important than showering his babba with kisses. </p> <p>To a significant extent this act was almost certainly copycat babyism. For it had been only a few days earlier that David Beckham celebrated winning the league title in the company of his 14 month old son Brooklyn. The other Manchester United players also brought their offspring onto the pitch. </p> <p>Nor is this a bit of local madness infecting soccer players. Across the media, celebrities known for their stereotypically masculine ways are showing signs of baby love. </p> <p>The Gallagher brothers, supposedly wild men of rock, did not turn up for the launch party of their new album because they were babysitting. Said a besotted Liam of his new son Lennon, \"I realise I'm blessed.\" Damon Albarn, his great rival, is talking of giving up work to look after his baby. </p> <p>Martin Clunes, who played the misogynistic Gary in the BBC's Men Behaving Badly recently added his voice to the chorus of baby-worhippers. \"No matter how many preconceptions you have nothing really prepares you for the second when your baby is born.\" </p> <p>What is going on? What accounts for the baby's pulling power? </p> <p>More than 50 years ago the ethologist Konrad Lorenz suggested that infants are equipped with features that automatically set off a rush of emotions in us. Their cuteness is comprised of soft skin and hair, almost adult-sized eyes from birth, big pupils, chubby cheeks, fully formed hands and feet, and small noses. Their heads are big and their limbs are small and springy. </p> <p>Evolutionists claim our response to these traits is built into us because infants need to arrive irresistible because without care they die. The basic baby construction is said to have profound meaning to us and to elicit tender feeling for this reason. </p> <p>As with all evolutionary psychological theories, it is a speculation which cannot be proved or disproved. Certainly, it is true that juvenile traits in animals instinctively evoke nurture. Chicks have stripes, lion cubs have spots and tail rings, and baby chimps have white tail tufts, all of which signal their helplessness. Thus, chimps who lose the tail tuft are not safe from attack. In the same way, it is speculated, the big heads, big eyes, chubby cheeks and little noses of human infants trigger a protective instinct in us. </p> <p>There is evidence that babies who do not look very babyish because they are ill or deformed or ugly receive less attention than normal-looking ones. The inference is that mothers are genetically primed to seek signs of health and not to waste valuable energy on infants who are a bad biological bet. </p> <p>It has also been suggested that men are responding to neotonous, infantile features when they are attracted to women. Evolutionists believe that men are attracted to the looks of the helpless and dependent. If infant features automatically evoke nurture then the more infantile a woman looks, the more men she will attract. </p> <p>Certainly, it is true that male desire is triggered by youthful attributes. A survey of 454 traditional societies showed that the average age of brides was between 12 and 15 years. The extreme youthfulness of the look (and increasingly, the age) of models in developed nations suggests this age group retain their desirability. </p> <p>In developed nations, when people are asked to create separate generic images for a child, an adult, a man and a woman using a special computer programme, they create very similar ones for female and child and for male and adult. As faces age they become more masculine; to look feminine is to look young. </p> <p>On top of all this, I would hazard that the appeal of a baby is also its psychological attributes, especially its authenticity. </p> <p>As soon as offspring can talk there is a loss of innocence. They show signs of the cunning, self-interest and other ugly adult attributes that led to Sartre's dictum \"hell is other people.\" </p> <p>By contrast, an infant is incapable of pretence. Honest emotion, unmediated by thought and language, can be witnessed on its face. In exactly the same way that a pet is unpretending and can be trusted, a baby denotes uncomplicated truthfulness. </p> <p>Certainly, when a politician plants his kiss on the baby (women politicians do not seem to do the baby gag) he is emphasising his nurturant potential - \"I'm a guy who can care for and show love towards the vulnerable.\". But every bit as much, he is also saying, \"You can trust me like you can trust a baby. I'm a human being (as well as a lying shit).\" </p> <p>But having said all this, there are also strong grounds for doubting that our intense feelings about babies are nearly as much powered by instinct as evolutionists would maintain. The fact is that much as we may love babies, we also hate them and, in evolutionary terms, until very recently there was a strong case for parents not to get too attached to offspring until they have passed the age of five. </p> <p>The problem with babies in the past was that they were a dangerous drain on emotional and physical resources. At least one quarter of children died before the age of five. Women gave birth to an average of eight children so the high infant mortality rate would have rocked them twice during their childbearing years unless they avoided caring too passionately for their infants. </p> <p>As the psychohistorian Lloyd De Mause put it, \"The history of childhood is a nightmare from which we have only recently begun to awake. The further back in history one goes, the lower the level of childcare, and the more likely children are to be killed, abandoned, beaten, terrorised and sexually abused.\" In this view, our passionate love for infants is a relatively new development. </p> <p>I found plenty of support for De Mause's analysis when carrying out a study of childcare in a village in western Ecuador. It was typical in most respects of what life was like for the majority of the world's population before 1900, with high infant mortality and basic subsistence a constant struggle. </p> <p>Few of the mothers became intensely attached to their infants. Given the infant mortality rate this made sense. If they fell in love with their babies in the way that mothers in technologically developed societies are supposed to do, they would be putting themselves at grave risk of suffering repeated bereavement. </p> <p>Other cross-cultural research bears this out. Compared with mothers in urban developed nations, those from agrarian, undeveloped nations are more concerned with meeting the physical needs and protecting the health of the infant than with forming intense relationships through play and talk. </p> <p>It has even been argued that abuse was a natural, healthy adaptation. Jay Belsky, a key thinker in this debate based at King's College in London, writes that \"across the animal kingdom, the mistreatment of progeny is so widespread that it would seem to be as much a part of the 'natural' condition as is sensitive, solicitious parental behaviour.\" </p> <p>He points out that in humans as well as animals, the interests of offspring and parents frequently compete rather than coincide. When this competition becomes too threatening to the parent's mental health or physical survival, abuse is liable to happen. </p> <p>Belsky presents extensive evidence that where instability, unpredictability or unavailability of resources exist for parents, they are more likely to maltreat children. Thus, poverty and low income correlate strongly with abuse and neglect. </p> <p>In evolutionary terms there were two conflicting pressures at work when it comes to babies. From their standpoint it made great sense to evolve as innately attractive, otherwise they would not survive. But for parents they were a risky investment before the age of five, a large drain on resources it was best not to get too attached to. </p> <p> In fact, genes may play only a minimal part in our feelings about babies, perhaps giving us a general tendency to feel positively towards them but allowing great variation depending on circumstances. Many individuals, for all sorts of reasons, prefer toddlers or children to helpless infants. </p> <p>Mothers who work full-time are more likely to believe that genes largely determine the personality of a child and that parental care is relatively unimportant. Full-time mothers are more likely to believe that what they do forms the child. It may well also be that the working mothers prefer children who can talk and with whom they can have a more adult relationship than infants. </p> <p>Indeed, many parents find the massive dependence of infants alarming and actually depressing. Women who are vulnerable to the illness are are at greatest risk of developing it during the first six months of a child's life. </p> <p>That parents of both sexes can find infants immensely upsetting is the reason why babies under the age of one are four times more likely than other age groups to be murdered. Nor is violence an unusual response - threequarters of infants have been hit by a parent before their first birthday. </p> <p>It is easily forgotten that until very recently anyone who could afford to would pass the care of their infant over to a nanny and that the example the aristocracy set was of a nonchalant lack of passion. </p> <p>Not until his fourth birthday did Charles share the day with Prince Philip (he was absent for six of the first eight birthdays). His mother seems to have been able to contain her enthusiasm for the future king as well. Her biographer reports that on returning to Britain after a six-week absence, the separation from her infant son had not caused \"any obvious consternation\" to her and therefore she did not \"find it neccessary to rush back to him.\" She caught up on her correspondence and other administration at home, went with her mother to watch one of her horses race and only after four days did she finally visit her two year old son. </p> <p>It is hard to imagine a mother acting like that today and even harder still to find such a negligent father. We can be sure that whatever the reality, Blair will not be presented as having acted like this. Indeed, one of the strongest pieces of evidence that baby love is largely dictated by social trends is today's unprecedented passion of men for their babies. </p> <p>A study done in 1960 found that the pupils of women and children dilate when shown a picture of a baby but not the pupils of a man. In those days men had no involvement in baby care and most had no special feeling towards them. But if that research were repeated today and the subjects included the likes of David Beckham or Liam Gallagher, the results would be very different. </p> <p>Part of the explanation for the new male passion is their increasing presence at the birth, following childbirth classes. Subsequently, they are more expected to change nappies and pull their weight and this greater involvement has increased their awareness of the the charms of the infant. </p> <p>There are even studies which are now being published that show men experience \"sympathetic pregnancies\" with their partners, up to and including changes in their hormonal balance. </p> <p>None of this change is remotely to do with genes. As with all the bogus attempts to explain our psychology by evolution, it turns out that your particular family history and the society you are in are far stronger determinants of your psychology. While genes may give us a slight prejudice in favour of babies over, say, the aged, it is the facts that they are far more likely to survive the early years and pose much less of a threat to the survival of parents that has turned them into an electoral dividend. </p> <p>It is that, not evolution or God, which Alastair Campbell should thank as he lays his plans to exploit young Leo's charms. </p> <p>Oliver James is a clinical psychologist.

      "bodyText": "When politicians want to ingratiate themselves with the electorate they are pictured kissing a baby; not a small child or a little old lady, but an infant. The association with a tiny, weeny, cooing, gurgling little babbakinsy-poos has a special power. Tony Blair has pulled off a spectacular variation of this political stunt. Not only can he now show off his baby son, he can do so in the run- up to an election. This is particularly desirable for a prime minister who, despite his popularity, has never really been loved or lovable. But what is most interesting of all is that no one - not even the most hardened of cynical political pundits - seems to doubt that the arrival of Blair Minimus will be a huge electoral asset, adding poll percentage points. No other life event would have the same effect on a politician's standing; not getting married, not being cured of a terrible illness, not even being in charge of the nation when winning the World Cup. The appeal of the little blighters seems to have exploded just lately, extending beyond the traditional domain of women into the lap or on to the shoulder of men, not all of them New. Take Dennis Wise, a man not known for his maternal, caring sharing ways. When he went up to collect the FA Cup on Saturday he stopped off to pick up his tiny infant. Astonishingly, we Chelsea supporters witnessed the implicit message that winning the cup was less important than showering his babba with kisses. To a significant extent this act was almost certainly copycat babyism. For it had been only a few days earlier that David Beckham celebrated winning the league title in the company of his 14 month old son Brooklyn. The other Manchester United players also brought their offspring onto the pitch. Nor is this a bit of local madness infecting soccer players. Across the media, celebrities known for their stereotypically masculine ways are showing signs of baby love. The Gallagher brothers, supposedly wild men of rock, did not turn up for the launch party of their new album because they were babysitting. Said a besotted Liam of his new son Lennon, \"I realise I'm blessed.\" Damon Albarn, his great rival, is talking of giving up work to look after his baby. Martin Clunes, who played the misogynistic Gary in the BBC's Men Behaving Badly recently added his voice to the chorus of baby-worhippers. \"No matter how many preconceptions you have nothing really prepares you for the second when your baby is born.\" What is going on? What accounts for the baby's pulling power? More than 50 years ago the ethologist Konrad Lorenz suggested that infants are equipped with features that automatically set off a rush of emotions in us. Their cuteness is comprised of soft skin and hair, almost adult-sized eyes from birth, big pupils, chubby cheeks, fully formed hands and feet, and small noses. Their heads are big and their limbs are small and springy. Evolutionists claim our response to these traits is built into us because infants need to arrive irresistible because without care they die.

As with all evolutionary psychological theories, it is a speculation which cannot be proved or disproved. Certainly, it is true that juvenile traits in animals instinctively evoke nurture. Chicks have stripes, lion cubs have spots and tail rings, and baby chimps have white tail tufts, all of which signal their helplessness. Thus, chimps who lose the tail tuft are not safe from attack.

There is evidence that babies who do not look very babyish because they are ill or deformed or ugly receive less attention than normal-looking ones.

      "bodyText": "Germany's attempt to overcome its crisis in information technology by hiring thousands of Indian software professionals has so far proved an embarrassing failure, with fewer than 200 Indians expressing any interest in a visa scheme proposed by Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der. India's burgeoning computer software industry has responded with stunning indifference to the plan, which would allow 20,000 foreign software experts to come to Germany on five-year visas. \"I don't want to go to Germany. I would much rather go to the US,\" Kamalika Sen, a computer specialist with the German firm Siemens said yesterday, summing up the mood. In a sign of how Germany relationship with India has been turned upside down, Germany's foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, was startled to find three days ago that the chief minister of Karnataka, India's most hi-tech state, was too busy to meet him. During his trip to Bangalore Mr Fischer called on Azim Premji, the head of the Indian software giant Wipro and the subcontinent's richest man. Mr Premji apparently told him that the green card scheme was bureaucratic and unworkable. Germany should think about introducing a new flexible system of short-term visas for software professionals, he added. Chancellor Schr\u00f6der's plan to recruit from India and eastern Europe was prompted by the fact that Germany's information and telecommunications industry is growing by between 30,000-40,000 jobs a year - and has a shortfall of 75,000 people. But the green card scheme has sparked intense political debate within Germany, much of it verging on the racist. J\u00fcrgen R\u00fcttgers, a Christian Democrat politician in North Rhine-Westphalia, coined the election slogan Kinder statt Inder - children not Indians - meaning that German children should be trained to fill IT vacancies. The row appears to have put off the few Indian software professionals - India produces 133,000 a year - who had been considering a move to Germany. \"It is a very major deterrent,\" added Ms Sen, who lived in Munich for two years. \"We were a little bit puzzled about why this reaction should come up. It would take five to six years to train children to do these kinds of jobs.\" Although she had enjoyed her time in Germany, the scheme did not tempt her because it made no provision for her husband to join her, she added. In the run-up to the German foreign minister's visit, Indian IT experts have deluged the papers with explanations of why Germany fails to compete with the US: salaries are much lower, the visa is limited to five years only, immigration is practically impossible, and families are not encouraged to travel with the worker. Anand Mahindra, who runs his own IT business in Delhi, Antaeus Information Ltd, and has a German girlfriend, said he too would rather work in the United States. \"Xenophobia is on the increase in Germany because of the economic downturn. Why should I go to Germany and pay 50% tax when I can go to the US and pay 35%, and earn twice the salary?\" he asked. So far 1,000 applications for the German visa scheme, which starts on August 1, have been received. Of these around 200 are from Bulgaria, while Indian comes in second place with around 160.",

      "body": "<b>What did the nuclear club say it would do?</b> The five agreed to \"an unequivocal undertaking by the nuclear weapon states to accomplish the total elimimation of their nuclear arsenals, leading to nuclear disarmament to which all parties are committed\" under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT). <p><b>That sounds like a breakthrough, doesn't it?</b> Sort of. Kofi Annan, the UN secretary general, called it a significant step, but anti-nuclear groups point out that the five left themselves a huge loophole by omitting any timetable that would have put real teeth to their commitment. For the five, it was a way of deflecting international pressure on them to get rid of atomic weapons, without being pinned down. </p> <p><b>What is the NPT?</b> Signed in 1968, the NPT is a landmark international treaty designed to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology, to foster the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, and to further the goal of complete disarmament. When the treaty was first negotiated, only five nations had nuclear weapons - the US, the then Soviet Union, Britain, France, and China. There were fears that nuclear weapons would soon spread to dozens of countries, but the treaty stifled this threat. Today only three other countries (India, Pakistan, and Israel) have nuclear weapons, and they remain outside the treaty.</p> <p><b>What are the main elements of the NPT?</b> The treaty, which has 187 signatories, has three basic elements. First, states without nuclear weapons agree not to acquire them, and those with nuclear weapons cannot transfer them, or help any non-nuclear state in their manufacture or acquisition. Second, countries wishing to use nuclear power for peaceful purposes must agree to international inspections. Finally, the nuclear states promise to undertake good-faith negotiations to eliminate nuclear weapons entirely. The declaration of the five came at the end of a month-long review conference in New York.</p> <p><b>What is the review conference?</b> Five years ago, the countries party to the NPT agreed to make the treaty permanent after four weeks of sometimes bitter debate. While most countries favoured a permanent treaty, some feared such a move would take the pressure off the nuclear club to get rid of their atomic weapons. The delegates in New York met to discuss what progress has been made towards nuclear disarmament.</p> <p><b>What progress has been made in the last five years?</b> The treaty is in trouble. In 1998, Indian and Pakistan conducted tit-for-tat nuclear tests. The US has yet to ratify the comprehensive test ban treaty. In preparatory meetings, participants could not agree on the pace of disarmament. Above all, the biggest threat to the treaty comes from US plans to develop a national missile defence (NMD). The US says NMD would offer protection from \"rogue\" states such as Iraq and North Korea, but few experts believe that such a system will work and they fear that America's quest for absolute security will chip away at the concept of deterrence and make \"limited\" nuclear war more acceptable. NMD is the \"ghost at the wedding\", according to Rebecca Johnson of Acronym Institute, a London disarmament think tank.</p> <p><b>Any bright spots?</b> On the eve of the conference, Russia's parliament ratified the Start II arms reduction treaty, which commits the US and Russia to slash their strategic warheads from 6,000 to 3,500 by 2007. The Russian parliament also ratified the comprehensive test ban treaty, which the US senate has failed to ratify so far. The US and Russia are preparing to begin talks on Start 3 with the Russians wanting to go below 1,500, but the Americans do not want to go below 2,000 or 2,500. On the downside, the US is reportedly upgrading and stockpiling warheads which it was expected to destroy under Start.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.state.gov/www/global/arms/treaties/npt1.html#2\" target=\"_new\">The treaty in full</a><br><a href=\"http://www.armscontrol.org/ASSORTED/acaff.html\" target=\"_new\">The Arms Control Association</a><br><a href=\"http://www.un.org/\" target=\"_new\">UN</a><br><a href=\"http://www.stimson.org/campaign/currhst.htm\" target=\"_new\">Campaign for the NPT</a> </p>",

      "body": "<p>The Millennium Dome is seeking up to \u00a330 million from the National Lottery to save the jobs of 5,000 staff and stave off bankruptcy.</p> <p>The Greenwich attraction's chief executive Pierre-Yves Gerbeau is due to tell the Millennium Commission that he needs the money to meets its outstanding debts and carry on operating.</p> <p>Ministers are understood to have accepted that the \u00a3509 million of lottery money already given to the Dome will never be recovered and that the beleaguered exhibition will make huge losses.</p> <p>According to the Dome management's own figures, it is now expecting between only six and seven million visitors this year, compared with the 12 million it had expected.</p> <p>It was uncertain whether the nine-member commission would be willing to bail the Dome out again, having already topped up the original \u00a3399 million with further repayable grants of \u00a350 and \u00a360 million.</p> <p>It is believed that the commission is divided, with some members against expending further money on the Dome at the expense of less controversial projects.</p> <p>Others, however, believe that pulling the plug could be even more costly. They are expected to tell Mr Gerbeau to dismiss some of his staff and make cuts worth more than \u00a310 million in return for more lottery cash.</p> <p>Another option being floated was that the Government could sell the Dome early to either Nomura or Legacy - the two consortia competing to take over the site at the end of the year.</p> <p>Supporters of an early sell-off believe it would at least enable the Government to get the loss-making and politically-damaging project off its hands well ahead of the election.</p> <p>But Lord Falconer of Thoroton, the Cabinet Office minister with responsibility for the Dome, denied reports that it could be sold off early in September.</p> <p>Shadow culture secretary Peter Ainsworth argued that drastic action was needed to address the Dome's problems. \"There's no guarantee that the money that they are seeking now will be the end of the story,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.</p> <p>\"We are talking about the peak period for the Dome when they should be getting their maximum amount of income. Frankly, they have got a monumental hill to climb if they are going to achieve anything like the visitor numbers that they need.</p> <p>\"The best option is to try and seek a private buyer at a decent price to take the thing out of its misery, or to close it at the end of the summer.\" And Stephen Bayley, a former creative director of the Dome turned prominent critic, said the Dome was paying the price for patronising the public.</p> <p>\"I'm afraid this is 'I told you so'. One of the reasons I walked was because of the determination of the management and their political sponsors to patronise the public with a version of Disney.</p> <p>\"In PR terms the thing is a disaster, it's a national disgrace, and it's probably best to let it die quietly.</p> <p>\"The success of the Tate Modern in recent weeks has shown that the public isn't a moron, the public expect a higher standard,\" he said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Millennium Dome is seeking up to \u00a330 million from the National Lottery to save the jobs of 5,000 staff and stave off bankruptcy. The Greenwich attraction's chief executive Pierre-Yves Gerbeau is due to tell the Millennium Commission that he needs the money to meets its outstanding debts and carry on operating. Ministers are understood to have accepted that the \u00a3509 million of lottery money already given to the Dome will never be recovered and that the beleaguered exhibition will make huge losses. According to the Dome management's own figures, it is now expecting between only six and seven million visitors this year, compared with the 12 million it had expected. It was uncertain whether the nine-member commission would be willing to bail the Dome out again, having already topped up the original \u00a3399 million with further repayable grants of \u00a350 and \u00a360 million. It is believed that the commission is divided, with some members against expending further money on the Dome at the expense of less controversial projects. Others, however, believe that pulling the plug could be even more costly. They are expected to tell Mr Gerbeau to dismiss some of his staff and make cuts worth more than \u00a310 million in return for more lottery cash. Another option being floated was that the Government could sell the Dome early to either Nomura or Legacy - the two consortia competing to take over the site at the end of the year. Supporters of an early sell-off believe it would at least enable the Government to get the loss-making and politically-damaging project off its hands well ahead of the election. But Lord Falconer of Thoroton, the Cabinet Office minister with responsibility for the Dome, denied reports that it could be sold off early in September. Shadow culture secretary Peter Ainsworth argued that drastic action was needed to address the Dome's problems. \"There's no guarantee that the money that they are seeking now will be the end of the story,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"We are talking about the peak period for the Dome when they should be getting their maximum amount of income. Frankly, they have got a monumental hill to climb if they are going to achieve anything like the visitor numbers that they need. \"The best option is to try and seek a private buyer at a decent price to take the thing out of its misery, or to close it at the end of the summer.\" And Stephen Bayley, a former creative director of the Dome turned prominent critic, said the Dome was paying the price for patronising the public. \"I'm afraid this is 'I told you so'. One of the reasons I walked was because of the determination of the management and their political sponsors to patronise the public with a version of Disney. \"In PR terms the thing is a disaster, it's a national disgrace, and it's probably best to let it die quietly. \"The success of the Tate Modern in recent weeks has shown that the public isn't a moron, the public expect a higher standard,\" he said.",

      "body": "<p>The Blairs can't say they weren't warned: the nappy debate gave the game away even before baby Leo arrived. Every decision they make over their fourth child's first year will have instant political significance - from choice of nappy (we already know their preference is for terry towelling rather than easy but landfill-clogging disposables) to childcare. In a spin-doctored world where the personal is political and vice versa, such details will be headline news, reported and chewed over by a string of columnists in more depth than Britain's dilemmas over Euro entry. Below, we detail some of the critical decisions facing the Blairs, like any parents, over the first 12 months, and gauge the significance of their preferences in buggies and babyfood for a fickle electorate.</p> <p><b> Breastfeeding</b><br></p> <p>Always a hot topic, and now more political than ever due to the row over breastfeeding in the House of Commons (despite requests from MPs nursing newborns, the speaker's office has banned the taking of \"refreshment\" in committee rooms). A new government Breast is Best campaign launched only days before Mrs Blair entered the labour ward is intended to boost UK breastfeeding rates from among the lowest in Europe, and the Department of Health would doubtless welcome such a high-profile example.</p> <p>On the basis of current statistics, she is almost certain to nurse, assuming all goes smoothly: figures show that middle-class, educated, older mothers are far more likely than their less well-off counterparts to prefer breast to bottle.</p> <p>However, if the lure of a return to the courtroom proves irresistible within weeks, she may choose to switch wholly or partly to formula - potentially incurring the wrath of the breast-is-best lobby. The choice of brand is a minefield - an ethical foreign policy would not approve of manufacturers who foist formula on poor women in developing countries.</p> <p><b> Father's role</b><br></p> <p>Tony Blair has already encountered the politics of paternity leave (a right which does not exist in the UK, though a new entitlement to unpaid parental leave has just been introduced) and has opted for a typically New Labour third way. To the disappointment of campaigners for better balance between home and work, he will not take time off , but hop up and down the Downing Street staircase between his No 10 office and the first family's appartment above No 11.</p> <p>But while the prime minister clearly did not feel he could be as radical as Finnish prime minister Paavo Lipponen, who took a week's leave on the birth of his baby last February, he is known to value greatly the time spent with his older children and is certain to be an involved father. Visitors to Chequers report that the Blair children and their father can often be found playing football in the gardens, and Mr Blair frequently refers in interviews to \"Cherie and the kids\".</p> <p>A key influence on the prime minister is likely to be the memory of the severe stroke which hit his own father, Leo, at just 40. The illness, though devastating, meant he benefited by seeing much more of the once workaholic barrister, Mr Blair has said. However, as prime minister, the battle for work-life balance is one he is unlikely to win. If the polls dip for Labour, critics will accuse him of devoting too much time to fatherhood; while leaving childcare duties to Mrs Blair and the nanny will mean bowing to the forces of Conservatism he claims to despise.</p> <p><b> Childcare</b><br></p> <p>Another contentious issue - Mrs Blair has already disclosed that, initially at least, she will spurn paid help in favour of her mother, Gale Booth, who will move into the Downing Street flat. In doing so, she will buck the trend among professional parents, only 18% of whom rely on relatives to look after their children, compared with 44% of lower-income groups.</p> <p>Later on, the Blairs may well turn to a live-in nanny which would highlight the fact that, for the vast majority of parents, finding good childcare is costly, with neither tax relief nor employer incentives.</p> <p>The Blairs will also have to address the problem of isolation for the Downing Street baby, particularly since friends their own age are likely to have children much older than the new arrival. If they choose a toddler group, nursery or playgroup, it will have to be a public or voluntary-sector facility to avoid Tory jibes over going private.</p> <p><b> Clothing</b><br></p> <p>A tough dilemma now that political style so often triumphs over substance. Despite New Labour's professed passion for football, the Blairs are unlikely to opt for the miniature football boots \u00e0 la Ana\u00efs, daughter of Oasis's Noel Gallagher, nor the Brooklyn Beckham-style football shirt. Perhaps Ronit Zilkha, Mrs Blair's favourite designer, could be persuaded to knock up a few outfits for special occasions, though that could leave Worcester woman feeling outclassed. Buying British would mean sturdy but dull M&amp;S or Mothercare standbys, whereas Baby Gap, Middle England's favourite yet, sadly, American, could provide stylish mini combat trousers for that Islington look.</p> <p><b> Toys</b></p> <p>How much to spend, and what to buy, now that manufacturers so effectively persuade small consumers to fleece their parents? Leo should at least be too young for Pok\u00e9mon cards, but will the Blairs succumb to garish plastic teethers that play Old Macdonald - hardly in keeping with Georgian Downing Street - or go for stylish wooden alternatives favoured by parents but ignored by their offspring? Either way, the child is certain to be given footballs galore, with the soccer vote in mind.</p> <p><b> Transport</b><br></p> <p>The Blairs famously pile their brood into a people-carrier, but Leo's personal transport will require some tough decisions. The options have multiplied since the births of Euan, 16, Nicky, 14 and Kathryn, 12, as has the style subtext lurking behind the most innocent buggy. The old-fashioned carriage pram would hark back to the Mary Poppins era but the trendy, all-terrain three-wheeler could come in handy for the Downing Street roadhumps.</p> <p>The practical Blairs, whose hall was reported by their former nanny to be jammed with pushchairs and toys, will probably go for a prudent but purposeful \"travel system\" combining car seat, buggy and carrycot. Maybe Uncle Gordon who lives next door will even be allowed to push the buggy occasionally.</p> <p><b> Vaccinations</b><br></p> <p>Every parent faces a dilemma over immunisation, but the vast majority weigh up the relative risks and opt to have it done. Babies are vaccinated against polio, diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough and the Hib form of meningitis at two months, three months and four months; at a year or a little more they have the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine, claimed to be linked controversially with autism.</p> <p>Since immunisation is part of a government programme, the Blairs are almost certain to have Leo vaccinated. There may be criticism from campaigners who argue that doctors put too much pressure on parents to agree to immunisation.</p> <p><b> Food</b><br></p> <p>Mrs Blair is opting for recycled nappies; will she buy organic baby food? Or will she set the best example and make her own? The trendiest babies are green ones, and the Blairs may choose to raise Leo on costly but pesticide-free organic meals - now taking 25% of the British market after a recent dramatic boom. Critics would make snide references to pur\u00e9ed polenta and grumble that only high-flying lawyers can afford such things. More risky for Tony Blair is the question of GM food? The PM has indicated that he is happy to eat GM himself, but the spectacle of former Tory minister John Gummer stuffing a burger down his daughter's throat to prove the safety of British beef should warn him off using his children as guineapigs.</p> <p><b> Back to work</b><br></p> <p>As a hotshot employment lawyer, Mrs Blair has already attracted criticism from some quarters by working so close to the birth, setting an example beyond the energy - or will - of most expectant mothers. Although 45, she is widely expected to follow the pattern she set with her older children and return to work relatively quickly. Work-life balance campaigners, however, will be watching to see whether the prime minister's wife, who recently moved to new legal chambers, cuts down her office hours and works at home, in line with the government's promotion of family-friendly working.</p> <p><b> Publicity</b><br></p> <p>The Blairs have always made much of shielding their children and family life from the public eye and insist they want to continue that policy with Leo. Downing Street has promised one photo session, after which he will disappear behind the security gates of Downing Street, emerging for the cameras only for the family's traditional Tuscan summer holiday snap.</p> <p>With a general election possibly under a year away, however, the temptation to wheel out the new arrival from time to time could prove too great, leading to a curious synchronicity between the little one's outings and William Hague's keynote speeches. The Blairs will have to be careful, though - any hint of exploitation and the strategy will backfire with the voters.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Blairs can't say they weren't warned: the nappy debate gave the game away even before baby Leo arrived. Every decision they make over their fourth child's first year will have instant political significance - from choice of nappy (we already know their preference is for terry towelling rather than easy but landfill-clogging disposables) to childcare. In a spin-doctored world where the personal is political and vice versa, such details will be headline news, reported and chewed over by a string of columnists in more depth than Britain's dilemmas over Euro entry. Below, we detail some of the critical decisions facing the Blairs, like any parents, over the first 12 months, and gauge the significance of their preferences in buggies and babyfood for a fickle electorate. Breastfeeding Always a hot topic, and now more political than ever due to the row over breastfeeding in the House of Commons (despite requests from MPs nursing newborns, the speaker's office has banned the taking of \"refreshment\" in committee rooms). A new government Breast is Best campaign launched only days before Mrs Blair entered the labour ward is intended to boost UK breastfeeding rates from among the lowest in Europe, and the Department of Health would doubtless welcome such a high-profile example. On the basis of current statistics, she is almost certain to nurse, assuming all goes smoothly: figures show that middle-class, educated, older mothers are far more likely than their less well-off counterparts to prefer breast to bottle. However, if the lure of a return to the courtroom proves irresistible within weeks, she may choose to switch wholly or partly to formula - potentially incurring the wrath of the breast-is-best lobby. The choice of brand is a minefield - an ethical foreign policy would not approve of manufacturers who foist formula on poor women in developing countries. Father's role Tony Blair has already encountered the politics of paternity leave (a right which does not exist in the UK, though a new entitlement to unpaid parental leave has just been introduced) and has opted for a typically New Labour third way. To the disappointment of campaigners for better balance between home and work, he will not take time off , but hop up and down the Downing Street staircase between his No 10 office and the first family's appartment above No 11. But while the prime minister clearly did not feel he could be as radical as Finnish prime minister Paavo Lipponen, who took a week's leave on the birth of his baby last February, he is known to value greatly the time spent with his older children and is certain to be an involved father. Visitors to Chequers report that the Blair children and their father can often be found playing football in the gardens, and Mr Blair frequently refers in interviews to \"Cherie and the kids\". A key influence on the prime minister is likely to be the memory of the severe stroke which hit his own father, Leo, at just 40. The illness, though devastating, meant he benefited by seeing much more of the once workaholic barrister, Mr Blair has said. However, as prime minister, the battle for work-life balance is one he is unlikely to win. If the polls dip for Labour, critics will accuse him of devoting too much time to fatherhood; while leaving childcare duties to Mrs Blair and the nanny will mean bowing to the forces of Conservatism he claims to despise. Childcare Another contentious issue - Mrs Blair has already disclosed that, initially at least, she will spurn paid help in favour of her mother, Gale Booth, who will move into the Downing Street flat. In doing so, she will buck the trend among professional parents, only 18% of whom rely on relatives to look after their children, compared with 44% of lower-income groups. Later on, the Blairs may well turn to a live-in nanny which would highlight the fact that, for the vast majority of parents, finding good childcare is costly, with neither tax relief nor employer incentives. The Blairs will also have to address the problem of isolation for the Downing Street baby, particularly since friends their own age are likely to have children much older than the new arrival. If they choose a toddler group, nursery or playgroup, it will have to be a public or voluntary-sector facility to avoid Tory jibes over going private. Clothing A tough dilemma now that political style so often triumphs over substance. Despite New Labour's professed passion for football, the Blairs are unlikely to opt for the miniature football boots \u00e0 la Ana\u00efs, daughter of Oasis's Noel Gallagher, nor the Brooklyn Beckham-style football shirt. Perhaps Ronit Zilkha, Mrs Blair's favourite designer, could be persuaded to knock up a few outfits for special occasions, though that could leave Worcester woman feeling outclassed. Buying British would mean sturdy but dull M&amp;S or Mothercare standbys, whereas Baby Gap, Middle England's favourite yet, sadly, American, could provide stylish mini combat trousers for that Islington look. Toys How much to spend, and what to buy, now that manufacturers so effectively persuade small consumers to fleece their parents? Leo should at least be too young for Pok\u00e9mon cards, but will the Blairs succumb to garish plastic teethers that play Old Macdonald - hardly in keeping with Georgian Downing Street - or go for stylish wooden alternatives favoured by parents but ignored by their offspring? Either way, the child is certain to be given footballs galore, with the soccer vote in mind. Transport The Blairs famously pile their brood into a people-carrier, but Leo's personal transport will require some tough decisions. The options have multiplied since the births of Euan, 16, Nicky, 14 and Kathryn, 12, as has the style subtext lurking behind the most innocent buggy. The old-fashioned carriage pram would hark back to the Mary Poppins era but the trendy, all-terrain three-wheeler could come in handy for the Downing Street roadhumps. The practical Blairs, whose hall was reported by their former nanny to be jammed with pushchairs and toys, will probably go for a prudent but purposeful \"travel system\" combining car seat, buggy and carrycot. Maybe Uncle Gordon who lives next door will even be allowed to push the buggy occasionally. Vaccinations Every parent faces a dilemma over immunisation, but the vast majority weigh up the relative risks and opt to have it done. Babies are vaccinated against polio, diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough and the Hib form of meningitis at two months, three months and four months; at a year or a little more they have the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine, claimed to be linked controversially with autism. Since immunisation is part of a government programme, the Blairs are almost certain to have Leo vaccinated. There may be criticism from campaigners who argue that doctors put too much pressure on parents to agree to immunisation. Food Mrs Blair is opting for recycled nappies; will she buy organic baby food? Or will she set the best example and make her own? The trendiest babies are green ones, and the Blairs may choose to raise Leo on costly but pesticide-free organic meals - now taking 25% of the British market after a recent dramatic boom. Critics would make snide references to pur\u00e9ed polenta and grumble that only high-flying lawyers can afford such things. More risky for Tony Blair is the question of GM food? The PM has indicated that he is happy to eat GM himself, but the spectacle of former Tory minister John Gummer stuffing a burger down his daughter's throat to prove the safety of British beef should warn him off using his children as guineapigs. Back to work As a hotshot employment lawyer, Mrs Blair has already attracted criticism from some quarters by working so close to the birth, setting an example beyond the energy - or will - of most expectant mothers. Although 45, she is widely expected to follow the pattern she set with her older children and return to work relatively quickly. Work-life balance campaigners, however, will be watching to see whether the prime minister's wife, who recently moved to new legal chambers, cuts down her office hours and works at home, in line with the government's promotion of family-friendly working. Publicity The Blairs have always made much of shielding their children and family life from the public eye and insist they want to continue that policy with Leo. Downing Street has promised one photo session, after which he will disappear behind the security gates of Downing Street, emerging for the cameras only for the family's traditional Tuscan summer holiday snap. With a general election possibly under a year away, however, the temptation to wheel out the new arrival from time to time could prove too great, leading to a curious synchronicity between the little one's outings and William Hague's keynote speeches. The Blairs will have to be careful, though - any hint of exploitation and the strategy will backfire with the voters.",

The ruling demonstrates the wide discretion the courts have to accommodate the demands of the police and security and intelligence agencies. Judge Martin Stephens made the order under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act which gives judges the authority to decide what is in the \"public interest\". The judge made passing reference to the right to \"freedom of expression\" in the European convention on human rights - which from October will be part of English law. He stressed, however, that the convention allowed restrictions to this right \"in the interests of national security\" - a concept before which the courts invariably genuflect. Government agencies will soon get a new weapon in their armoury allowing them to intercept and seize information, including that held by journalists. The regulation of investigatory powers bill extends existing law, which is limited to post and telephones, by enabling the police and other agencies to apply to cabinet ministers for warrants to intercept all forms of telecommunications. These include documents and pictures distributed electronically, emails, and lists of websites contacted and email addresses - the equivalent to getting access to a log of telephone calls. MI5 is reported to be building a new \u00a325m surveillance system, codenamed GTAC - the government technical assistance centre - to monitor emails and other internet messages sent and received in Britain. Caspar Bowden, director of the Foundation for Information Policy Research, said: \"With this facility, the government can track every website that a person visits, without a warrant, giving rise to a culture of suspicion by association.\" Though information obtained by interception would be inadmissible as evidence in court, the police or security and intelligence agencies - or any government department - could use intercepts for covert fishing expeditions. The point about intercepts - unlike orders under the act which can be challenged in the courts - is that the holder of the information is unaware it is being done. Lawyers say that the bill has enormous implications for journalists and others since they would not be able to guarantee the confidentiality of the information on their computers, including information supplied by their sources.",

She will also propose a national agency to coordinate the seizures and end drug-related money laundering. The proposals were first considered by the Home Office organised crime directorate in November 1998, but have now been developed by the Cabinet Office think tank, the performance and innovation unit. After a month in which the government has been on the back foot on crime, Ms Mowlam, in a speech today, will say: \"Why should millions of law-abiding people work hard for a living while a few criminals live a life of luxury built on the misery of others?

Proposing to put new powers in place \"as soon as possible\", she will also reveal that the government is planning \"a new national agency staffed by top quality financial investigators to maximise the revenues seized\". She will also promise \"tough new measures against money laundering and wider laws to ensure that income from all crimes - not just drug trafficking - can be seized.\" The courts already have powers to confiscate the proceeds of crime by means of a criminal confiscation order. Even before proceedings begin, the prosecutor can obtain an order from the high court to freeze property, pending the making and enforcement of a criminal confiscation order. However, the Home Office crime directorate has acknowledged that these orders \"have not been as successful as originally anticipated\". The number of drug traffickers subject to confiscation orders rose from around 3,000 in each of the years 1987 to 1991 to only just over 7,000 in 1996. At the same time the total amount ordered to be confiscated rose from \u00a31m in 1987 to only just over \u00a310m in 1996. Even worse, the Home Office acknowledges, the amounts actually raised have remained stuck at \u00a35m per year. Between 1987 and 1996 only 157 drug trafficking confiscation orders for over \u00a3100,000 were made, even though there had been over 45,000 convictions for supply of drugs. Separately, customs officers have powers to forfeit or seize money if they suspect it represents the proceeds of drug trafficking, or is intended for use in drug trafficking.

Alan Smith, 55, has not been seen since May 9, when he was spotted near Songo, 25 miles inland from the capital and later the scene of intense fighting. In all, 334 UN peacekeepers are being held hostage by the rebels. The UN had hoped to use the captured RUF chief, Foday Sankoh, as a bargaining chip, but the Sierra Leonean government has rejected the RUFs demand for Mr Sankoh's release and said it will probably try him for murder, and this has stalled the peacekeepers' release. The police, British forces, including members of the SAS, and the UN have all been asked to look out for the Birmingham engineer. The defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, said there was considerable anxiety about his fate. \"We have been trying hard to locate him. That effort continues, but obviously it is a matter of great anxiety to us,\" he said. The Foreign Office has not said which aid agency Mr Smith works for, but he is believed to have been delivering second-hand computers to a local education charity. The FO said six or seven Sierra Leonean nationals working with him were also missing. In a televised address, President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah said Mr Sankoh was being investigated for the suspected murder of 20 unarmed demonstrators outside his house a fortnight ago, and for treasonably plotting a coup. The rebel leader has been in police \"protective custody with additional security provided by British forces since his capture last week. In an attempt to separate him from the RUF, Mr Tejan Kabbah appealed to other rebel leaders to give up fighting and open talks, adding: \"Those found wanting will be prosecuted.\" Mr Hoon said that while it was up to the Sierra Leonean authorities to decide Mr Sankoh's fate, he should not be allowed to take his place in government agreed in last July's much-violated peace accords. \"Obviously we would be concerned that he should no longer have any kind of an influence over Sierra Leone. He was the one who broke the peace accord, he's responsible for the recent upsurge in violence,\" Mr Hoon said. Sierra Leonean government forces have kept up the pressure on the RUF by pushing it further from Freetown. Yesterday it was massing at Magbelli Bridge, a strategic crossing 45 miles north-east of the capital, for an assault toward the town of Lunsar. Its capture would open the road to the rebel headquarters at Makeni. British officers coordinating the military strategy say there has been a transformation in the Sierra Leonean army, including a marked improvement in discipline and coordination and strengthened supply lines.

The conquerors of Grozny are now laying mines to deter further theft.</p> <p>\"New minelaying has been started in a city just cleared of mines and other ordnance. It's a paradox, but there's no other option,\" he said. \"Grozny is now being mined again by the new authorities.\"</p> <p>To travel north from Khankala, through the outskirts of Grozny, into the centre and on to the Staropromyslovsky district where an impromptu Chechen bazaar has sprung up is to witness destruction on an epic scale. Not one building has been spared.</p> <p>\"What do you expect? I know of a unit of 80 of our guys and only 12 of them survived the fight for Grozny,\" says Yury Vasin, a spokesman for Russia's justice ministry. \"I've just seen Grozny for the first time and, to be honest, I thought the damage would be worse. I thought there wouldn't be a stone left standing.\"</p> <p>What is left standing is uninhabitable. Twenty-foot bomb craters pock the roads. Bridges and tunnels are collapsed. High-rise blocks of flats have concertinaed into heaps of mangled masonry and metal. Charred shells of older, once elegant buildings are sprouting weeds and saplings. Hovels are being patched together out of the debris and scrawled signs have been placed on them proclaiming \"We live here.\"</p> <p>The totality of the destruction takes the breath away. On a bright spring day, there is a cruel beauty to the ruins of Grozny. Bizarre, dream-like images burn themselves on the memory - four elderly blind men tiptoeing through the debris, holding hands and clutching sticks; two peasant women embraceing silently on a sunny street, tears streaming down their faces; a middle-aged woman suddenly running after a western reporter, pleading as she throws a folded scrap of paper for him to catch.</p> <p>It reads: \"They've been holding my son illegally for four months. Akhmed Arbiyevich, born 1976. They took him away and won't let him go.\"</p> <p>\"There's no money, no work, no water, no electricity, no prospects,\" says Ruslan Khatuyev, a 25-year-old Chechen man lingering at the bazaar where country women are selling garlic bulbs, radishes, parsley, and tomatoes. \"No nothing.\"</p> <p>The mayor maintains there are now 100,000 people in a city that once was home to four times that number. But the true figure can only be a quarter of the mayor's estimate and most of them are still living in blasted basements.</p> <p>And beneath the Russian swagger, the troops are on edge. The violence is unremitting, the bitterness festers. Firefights erupt every night as the rebel gunmen infiltrate to stage hit-and-run attacks before melting back into the maze of ruins.</p> <p>\"The high intensity of firing at federal forces in Grozny suggests that the militants have started implementing orders to intensify subversive and terrorist activity,\" the Russian military has admitted.</p> <p>\"They call it liberated Grozny, but there's no freedom, only taunting,\" says Raisa Nakhamadova, 62, who has lost two sons.</p> <p>\"Every night, from dusk till dawn, the firing never stops,\" says Mrs Isayeva. \"Russian soldiers came around drunk at 11pm the other night. They shot the neighbours, Maleyka and Hasan. They're in hospital. What about their three kids?\"</p>",

I know of a unit of 80 of our guys and only 12 of them survived the fight for Grozny,\" says Yury Vasin, a spokesman for Russia's justice ministry. \"I've just seen Grozny for the first time and, to be honest, I thought the damage would be worse. I thought there wouldn't be a stone left standing.\" What is left standing is uninhabitable. Twenty-foot bomb craters pock the roads. Bridges and tunnels are collapsed. High-rise blocks of flats have concertinaed into heaps of mangled masonry and metal. Charred shells of older, once elegant buildings are sprouting weeds and saplings. Hovels are being patched together out of the debris and scrawled signs have been placed on them proclaiming \"We live here.\" The totality of the destruction takes the breath away. On a bright spring day, there is a cruel beauty to the ruins of Grozny. Bizarre, dream-like images burn themselves on the memory - four elderly blind men tiptoeing through the debris, holding hands and clutching sticks; two peasant women embraceing silently on a sunny street, tears streaming down their faces; a middle-aged woman suddenly running after a western reporter, pleading as she throws a folded scrap of paper for him to catch. It reads: \"They've been holding my son illegally for four months. Akhmed Arbiyevich, born 1976. They took him away and won't let him go.\" \"There's no money, no work, no water, no electricity, no prospects,\" says Ruslan Khatuyev, a 25-year-old Chechen man lingering at the bazaar where country women are selling garlic bulbs, radishes, parsley, and tomatoes. \"No nothing.\" The mayor maintains there are now 100,000 people in a city that once was home to four times that number. But the true figure can only be a quarter of the mayor's estimate and most of them are still living in blasted basements. And beneath the Russian swagger, the troops are on edge. The violence is unremitting, the bitterness festers. Firefights erupt every night as the rebel gunmen infiltrate to stage hit-and-run attacks before melting back into the maze of ruins. \"The high intensity of firing at federal forces in Grozny suggests that the militants have started implementing orders to intensify subversive and terrorist activity,\" the Russian military has admitted. \"They call it liberated Grozny, but there's no freedom, only taunting,\" says Raisa Nakhamadova, 62, who has lost two sons. \"Every night, from dusk till dawn, the firing never stops,\" says Mrs Isayeva. \"Russian soldiers came around drunk at 11pm the other night. They shot the neighbours, Maleyka and Hasan. They're in hospital. What about their three kids?\"",

By the 70s, it was definitely frivolous. And by the 90s, it was unwise even to utter the F word in public. There was always one person who would have one drink too many and then tell you a thing or two about the population explosion.</p> <p>The scare statistics varied but the moral of the lecture was always the same: socially responsible parents stopped at \"replacement level\".</p> <p>There was a lingering sympathy for those who went on to have third children because their first two were the same sex. But if you already had a boy and a girl, you could expect to raise eyebrows. If you went for a fourth, the very first set of raised eyebrows would belong to the family planning nurse.</p> <p>As a rule, she would begin with the question: \"Are you Catholic?\" If you made the mistake of saying, as I did, \"Yes, but not practising\", you then got a friendly chat about the merits of the more \"reliable\" forms of birth control. The most reliable being, ahem, sterilisation. That was their view, anyway. My own view is that the most effective form of birth control is house-hunting. Or trying to find a car that's big enough to hold a family of six. Or maybe just looking at the prices. Trying to get sympathy for your predicament - that worked wonders, too. If you so much as mentioned that you would have to be a millionaire to afford a house with enough bedrooms, then someone would say: \"Well, you must have realised this would be a problem when you let yourself into this.\"</p> <p>But now attitudes are beginning to shift again. And it's not entirely due to the Blair baby.</p> <p>Our birth rate is sinking. Not as fast as it is in other parts of Europe - but the decline is steady and unlikely to reverse itself if present conditions persist. The decline is partly due to the fact that more and more people are choosing to remain childless, and partly to the fact that those who do have families have strong economic reasons to stop at two. But add up all these sensible choices and what you get is a rather serious problem in the long term. In the decades to come, we will have an ever smaller pool of working-age adults, and they will have to support an ever larger pool of pensioners.</p> <p>The solutions proposed so far by policy wonks are all rather dramatic. The easiest thing would be to accept that we cannot support our ageing population at the levels considered normal today. But this is not likely to be much of an election-winner, as most people would not want to vote for a policy that condemned them to poverty in old age. However, they are not likely to relish the three other proposed solutions either. One tack would be to increase taxes. Another would be to increase immigration. The gentlest option - as some European countries have already decided - would be to bring the birth rate back above replacement level again. In other words, make it just a bit easier for people to have more children. It is against this backdrop that four-child families begin to look not so ridiculous, and even socially useful.</p> <p>If they also look a little exotic, it is not just because they are rare. It is also because they tend to be departures from the original idea. Given the various pressures to keep families small, there are almost always extenuating circumstances. The plan was for three children, and the fourth was a surprise. Or the plan was to have two children, but after getting divorced, the father went on to have a second family. Or after stopping at two, and going back into full-time work, the mother got fed up with it all and went home to shock the neighbours by having another two after an eight, nine, 10-year gap.</p> <p>Or they never made a plan at all, because they didn't believe life should be like that. Boris Johnson of the Spectator and the publisher of Cond\u00e9 Nast, Nicholas Coleridge, fall into this category, as do so many of the people you see reclining on their priceless sofas in Hello magazine. But even in the more modest categories, there's always a story, and the stories always have a tinge of glamour and romance attached to them, if only because the parents in question are refusing to listen to their bank managers and are following their passions instead.</p> <p>This does not always lead to domestic bliss, and let's not mention the money side right now because it gives me a headache. That said, choosing to have a fourth child was the best reckless decision I ever made.</p> <p>I am still not sure it's quite fashionable enough to blab about those extenuating circumstances. But I'll say this much. There's a buzz in a house that has four children in it that you don't get if you stop at two or three. It comes, I think, from the number of relationships that are going on at the same time. If you include two parents in the equation, the total is 15: five plus four plus three plus two plus one. Because each child has such a distinct personality and interacts in such a different way with each of the other children, you never quite know what's going to happen next. The idea that you can shape your children in your image goes right out the window.</p> <p>Children in families of four enjoy a privacy and a freedom of movement that children in smaller families rarely get to know. They can be sure their parents will be too busy to be keeping them under constant sur veillance, or at least too tired to intervene in every last negotiation. And if they do get in trouble, they know it is only a matter of time before one of the other children becomes number one object of family shame.</p> <p>When I talk to people who grew up in four-children families in the 50s, they always mention how much they enjoyed being in houses where there were twice as many children as adults. It felt like the right balance of power. And they liked the variety of ages. First and second-born children recall the pleasure of being older brothers and sisters. The younger ones talk about seeing their older siblings as gods. There is always an exception - the one who played that cruel trick on you when you were six, or the little brat who took your best shoes out to jump in the puddles and whose name will always be mud. But as a rule, sibling rivalries seem to have less of a sting to them than they do in smaller families. Because even if you hate the very sight of the other child, at least you don't have to spend your whole life eyeball to eyeball. There's always someone else to talk to, so conflicts are never quite as intense. The same rule applies to parents. It was very comforting, for example, having two little ones around when my older children became teenagers. I cannot claim that I was not a nervous wreck, but I know I would have been even more hysterical and clingy if they had been leaving me to an empty house.</p> <p>And when I argued with my teenagers, it didn't hit me as hard as it might have done, because in the next room there were these two little children who still liked and admired me and were longing to climb on to my lap. Talking at their level for hours on end was a pleasure not a drain, because I knew that once they were in bed I could go back to the teenagers and have an almost adult conversation. Or ask them to babysit, and go out to see a movie.</p> <p>My relationships with my children now that I have four of them are also less Significant than they were when I had one, two, and three. A friend of mine who also has four children says it's because you \"don't quite have all your eggs in one basket\". You might still be trying to live out your fantasies through them, but that still means fewer fantasies per child. You also have a much stronger sense of each child's personality. Now that you have learned from experience that not all girls are alike, and that boys vary in temperament just as much, you are much quicker to pick up on and appreciate the differences. And what a comfort it is to put all your experience to good use. In families where there are only two, closely spaced children, you are forever learning about a certain age only to have to throw all your hard-won wisdom away as you race to learn about the next age. If you have four children, you know that anything you learn with your older children will help you later on with the younger ones.</p> <p>So in almost every way, life in a four-child family is more relaxed than it is in a smaller family. But here we come to the down side, aka the end of the month. It is incredibly expensive to keep four children in shoes, let alone anything else. I don't think I'll itemise the bills, because (as people are always reminding me), I'm the one who got myself into this and so I'm the one who's going to have to pay for it. Maybe in a few years, when we've all seen enough pictures of the new improved Blair family, people will start viewing the F word in a more favourable light. Maybe we'll even get letters from the Queen congratulating us for following so bravely in her footsteps. Maybe we'll see new policies coming in, offering incentives for people who would like four to be the new three. But until that day arrives, the four-child family will continue to be a luxury that only the very rich and reckless can afford.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Rick Lazio began his whirlwind transformation from relative political obscurity to national prominence at the weekend as the Republican party's new standard-bearer battled to establish himself as a credible rival to Hillary Clinton in the New York Senate election. Just hours after New York City's mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, threw the November contest wide open by withdrawing because of his recently diagnosed prostate cancer, Mr Lazio went on a whistlestop tour of the television studios and embarked on a four-city swing through the state in an attempt to overcome Mrs Clinton's surge in the opinion polls. The scale of the task facing Mr Lazio, a 42-year-old congressman from Long Island, was underlined by a poll showing Mrs Clinton has jumped into a 14-point lead following Mr Giuliani's withdrawal. Mr Giuliani and Mrs Clinton were neck and neck in the polls, but the new survey of likely New York state voters, published in the New York Post, shows Mrs Clinton with 46% support, Mr Lazio on 32% and 17% undecided. Mr Lazio began his campaign by stressing what he hopes will be a key advantage over Mrs Clinton, the fact that he has spent all his life in New York, has a New York-born wife Patricia, and sends his two daughters to New York schools. \"You can tell from my accent that I am a lifelong New Yorker,\" Mr Lazio said at a rally on Saturday. \"I didn't need an exploratory committee to help me figure out where I wanted to live\". Describing himself as \"a centrist, a mainstream Republican\", Mr Lazio says he is right-of-centre on tax and budget issues and \"realistic\" on social policies. He has records of support for abortion rights and for moderate gun control - measures which are indispensable for Republicans running for state-wide office in New York. Mr Lazio made it clear yesterday that he intends to attack Mrs Clinton more forcefully than Mr Giuliani has.

      "bodyText": "Hours after a Jewish toddler was badly burnt by a petrol bomb, Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, yesterday lost patience with eight consecutive days of rioting in the West Bank and Gaza and ordered his negotiators to return from peace talks in Stockholm. The severity of Mr Barak's response, amid the violence in Palestinian-controlled areas and heavy fighting in south Lebanon, deepened the sense that events may be spinning out of control. Mr Barak is openly frustrated with the failure of the Palestinian Authority to rein in the protesters in the areas it controls - including the policemen who fired live rounds at Israeli soldiers twice in the last week. Earlier yesterday, he demanded that the Palestinian Authority take forceful steps to end the unrest - the worst since 1996 - and took the unusual step of banning Israelis and foreign tourists from Palestinian-controlled areas. With a two-year-old Israeli girl on life support in a Jerusalem hospital after the car in which she was travelling was attacked outside the town of Jericho, Mr Barak may feel that he cannot be seen to be discussing a peace settlement with the Palestinians that would involve concessions on territory, and on prisoners - the protesters' main demand. Mr Barak told his weekly cabinet meeting yesterday that the transfer of Abu Dis and other villages near Jerusalem was on hold until Mr Arafat could promise there would be no further violence. On Saturday night he cancelled a summit meeting in Washington. Yesterday Hizbullah guerrillas in southern Lebanon used mortars and machine guns against an Israeli post near the Golan Heights. Israeli Radio said the attack was believed to be related to Lebanon's demand that Israel withdraw from the Sheba'a farms at the foot of Mount Hermon during its unilateral withdrawal. The prime minister's office summoned its two negotiators from the unofficial talks in Stockholm \"in light of the situation in the [Palestinian] territories\", and to update them on conversations Mr Barak has held in recent days with world leaders. During the past week of unrest, in which five Palestinians were killed and hundreds were wounded, Israel has accused Mr Arafat of stoking protests to force concessions on territory before September, the deadline for a final peace settlement. In turn, Palestinian leaders say Israel has inflamed the protesters by using live ammunition, and by threatening to use attack helicopters. However, the protests are also driven by a campaign for the release of around 1,650 political prisoners, still being held in Israeli jails after nearly seven years of negotiations. More than 1,000 have been on hunger strike, led by 60 inmates at the Hadarim jail. The Hadarim inmates, who have subsisted on small cups of milk and soup since May 1, plan to intensify their protest later this month with an all-out hunger strike.

One day after the arrival of Leo Blair, the prime minister and his wife quietly retreated to Downing Street's inner sanctum to recover from a 12-hour labour and an unsettled first night. Yesterday they remembered what a difficult, draining business having a baby can be. While the world's media waited for the first photographic glimpse of the \"lovely little kid\" - as his father called him - Mrs Blair said in a statement that it was so long since the birth of her other three children she had forgotten \"quite what an ordeal those last few hours of labour can be\". After thanking the midwives, doctors and other staff at the Chelsea and Westminster hospital, where the birth took place, she added: \"Now that Leo is here, I am very tired but full of joy. Tony and the children are a real help and all of us are really touched by the flowers, messages and presents, not just from friends and colleagues but, perhaps above all, from people we have never met.\" Her husband, who went to Westminister Cathedral with their three other children, Euan, 16, Nicky, 14, and Kathryn, 12, looked weary after the baby's first night at Downing Street. He told fellow worshippers: \"It definitely wasn't a quiet night.\" Mrs Blair, 45, gave birth to her fourth child at 12.25am on Saturday morning. The 3.06kg (6lb 12oz) boy, the first child born to a serving prime minister for 150 years, is named after Mr Blair's father. A spokesman said the family spent a quiet afternoon at Downing Street with their new arrival yesterday, and that the atmosphere was \"relaxed and happy\". A group of students visiting from Nebraska, USA, who were given a rare tour of Number 10, said they had seen \"lots of cuddly toys\" lying around. The house was also filled with flowers and messages of congratulation from round the world: greetings came from the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, the Tory leader William Hague and his wife Ffion, Hillary Clinton, and the Russian president Vladimir Putin and his wife Lyudmila. The cabinet office minister Lord Falconer, a close friend of the Blairs, said: \"The reality of yesterday was a mother and father wreathed in grins because they had a baby.\" He told the BBC's Breakfast With Frost: \"The most important thing which happened as far as the Blairs are concerned is that they are relieved and delighted that Leo has come and is safe. Obviously these things are attended by great anxiety but, at the end, great happiness.\" Mr Blair has promised to reduce his commitments so that he can spend as much time as possible with Leo, but will not take formal paternity leave. Leo is expected to be baptised at a Roman Catholic church in Mr Blair's Sedgefield, Co Durham, constituency.",

      "bodyText": "The campaign to ban fox-hunting will be delivered a severe blow when an official inquiry reveals that there is no conclusive evidence to show that foxes suffer physical pain and terror when being pursued by a pack of dogs. But opponents of hunting will seize on other conclusions in the Burns inquiry report, including research that shows farmers massively overestimate the size of the fox population and the danger it poses to livestock. The Burns inquiry is due to publish its findings in the next few weeks amid signs that it will offer a range of options, including a limited or outright ban. The inquiry, chaired by Sir Terry Burns, the former Treasury permanent secretary, was set up by the home secretary, Jack Straw, with the stated aim of trying to remove some of the emotional heat and increase informed debate about fox-hunting. The research acknowledges that foxes suffer a high heart rate during a chase and are not always cleanly killed by hounds dislocating the neck, as claimed by supporters of hunting. It has also concluded that the impact of hunting with hounds on fox culling in lowland areas is \"extremely small\" and that removing hunting with hounds \"has very little long term effect on the pervading population trend\". By contrast, a ban on hunting with dogs in upland areas could have \"a profound effect\" since the majority of foxes there have been killed using dogs. Critics claimed the inquiry was established to make it less likely that legislation banning fox-hunting could be implemented before the general election. The government has promised to offer \"reasonable parliamentary time, if necessary\", and drafting assistance for a private member's bill banning fox-hunting. It has also promised a free vote, ensuring that the measure will be passed in the Labour-dominated Commons, but probably delayed in the Lords. A paper commissioned by the inquiry from Professor Patrick Bateson on the welfare implications of hunting foxes finds that although body temperature of foxes rise during a chase - sometimes lasting longer 30 minutes - there is no final evidence that it produces permanent damage. But a post-mortem study of foxes shows that some are probably injured before the kill. The research more conlusively rejects the use of terriers to dig out foxes, saying the cornered fox can reasonably be compared with a fox in a box trap, and demonstrates a pronounced stress. The study also states: \"No scientific evidence exists on whether shooting is a more humane way of killing foxes since little is known of the accuracy of shooting and the rates of wounding.

It also points out that employment in the rural communities has increased by nearly 600,000 over the past 20 years. A report commissioned by the inquiry from three universities on management of the fox population and its predatory status concludes: \"Despite the widespread belief that foxes are serious predators of livestock, there is evidence to suggest their importance is generally overestimated and that in fact they are responsible for only a minor percentage of losses.\" For instance the study has found only 3% of lost lambs can be attributed to foxes, compared with 18% claimed by farmers.

The Mori poll for the pressure group Daycare Trust also reveals that just over two-thirds of parents with school age children regard affordable childcare as essential in enabling women to return to work. Middle England voters are even more likely than those in the lower socio-economic groups to put the issue first, with 71% of ABC1s saying care they can afford is the key issue. Almost half of parents believe employers do not support mothers, according to the survey, with around the same number saying that a supportive employer is a primary factor in helping women return to the workplace. Better-off parents, in particular, want to see the government ensuring that employers offer more flexible working to mothers returning from maternity leave. The poll comes as ministers are acknowledging that initial moves to improve childcare have led to growing momentum for better and cheaper facilities. The chancellor, Gordon Brown, is considering multi-million pound bids from education ministers in advance of the comprehensive spending review in July, to plug yawning gaps in care for the youngest children, aged up to three. The birth of Tony and Cherie Blair's fourth child will focus yet more attention on childcare dilemmas. Margaret Hodge, the minister responsible for childcare and early years education, said: \"We can never go as fast as everybody would like, but the key is to get a solid structure in place to make sure all children are given a decent start in life.\"",

The research undermines the claims of Eli Lilly, makers of Prozac, that people who kill themselves while on the tablets do so because of their depression, and that the disease, not the drug, is to blame for their suicide. Its findings are particularly worrying because of the increasing numbers of people, including children, who are being given the drugs by their GP for mild depression, and who are not seriously clinically ill.

A confidential letter written by the former minister and obtained by the Guardian reveals that he orchestrated a plot to wreck the fireworks bill - introduced by Linda Gilroy, Labour MP for Plymouth, Sutton - with Lord Kimball, the deputy chairman of the Countryside Alliance. The bill, which had the support of the fireworks industry, the police, fire services and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (Rospa), would have introduced new controls over people responsible for public displays and a training programme for people handling fireworks. It would also have allowed imported fireworks to be traced in Britain and would have empowered Stephen Byers, the trade secretary, to introduce emergency safety regulations to respond to events such as last week's fatal firework warehouse fire in the Netherlands. In a letter marked \"confidential - hunting bill - remaining parliamentary tactics\", Mr Maclean, the MP for Penrith and the Border, disclosed his hatred of the fireworks legislation. \"I do not want the fireworks bill to be enacted,\" it said. \"That is nothing to do with hunting tactics, but it is because I think it is a thoroughly bad bill, full of Henry VIII clauses [the powers given to ministers to introduce regulations by order] and, since the government are desperately keen on it, this must be one of the bills they do not get, as punishment for letting their backbenchers play around with hunting.\" He goes on: \"We will block everything else in the Commons listed for July 3 [the day the fireworks bill was due to be debated] and I think if the government only get seven reasonably small private members bills this session, they might begin to realise the consequences of their supporters toying with anti-hunting bills.\" He tells Lord Kimball: \"How you deal with fireworks [the bill] is up to you; I am happy for it to die in the Lords or come back to us behind two or three other bills so that we run out of time for it in Commons consideration of Lords' amendments.\" Later, he adds: \"I know you will suitably hold up fireworks.\" The disclosure of the confidential letter yesterday shocked the bill's original promoter, Ms Gilroy, other Labour MPs and the firework industry. They admitted yesterday they had no idea that Mr Maclean and Lord Kimball had orchestrated the blocking of the bill in July 1998. Mr Maclean, who was present during the proceedings that \"talked out\" the fireworks bill, played only a minor role with one intervention. The main MPs against the measure were Eric Forth, the Tory MP for Bromley, who opposes all private legislation; Edward Leigh, the Tory MP for Gainsborough; and Tim Collins, the Tory MP for Westmorland. Because the hunting bill was behind the firework bill when it reached the Commons, it never got debated and therefore collapsed. Richard Burden, Labour MP for Birmingham, Northfield, said last night: \"Given that this bill would have helped to reduce serious injuries among children and animals... I find [the blocking of] this bill, to help people who chase foxes, was nothing less than contemptible.\" John Woodhead, who helps lobby for change in the industry, said: \"If this bill had become law it would certainly help ministers now to deal with any regulation changes that might be necessary after the disastrous fireworks warehouse explosion in Holland. \"Last year serious injuries from fireworks rose again - and this bill would have helped keep them down.\" Ms Gilroy said: \"I would not believe that a former Home Office minister would stoop to such tactics. It is the unacceptable face of public schoolboy games played to protect blood sports.\" The Guardian twice tried to contact Mr Maclean, but he was unavailable for comment.",

      "bodyText": "The new home of British modern art, Tate Modern, was yesterday targeted by a pair of \"guerrilla artists\" who claimed to have urinated on an 80-year-old work by Marcel Duchamp. Yuan Cai and JJ Xi last made the news when they stripped and jumped on Tracey Emin's Turner Prize nominated Bed in October 1999. Appropriately, the work involved yesterday, entitled Fountain, is in fact a urinal. The pair claimed that the purpose of their action was to \"celebrate the spirit of modern art\". A spokeswoman at the Tate Modern's information desk said she had no knowledge of the incident. But Katie Hill, spokeswoman for the two artists, said she had photographs and a video to prove their claims. The men said that they walked into the room which contained Duchamp's Fountain, lowered their trousers, urinated, and left. Bemused onlookers in the room applauded, thinking that they had just seen an officially planned performance. The artists claim that after their performance, which lasted about a minute, the Tate closed the room to the public but made no attempt to apprehend them. \"There were no security guards and they just got away with doing it,\" Ms Hill said. The men, who both live in London, said they targeted the piece by the French modern artist because it was itself the centre of controversy when it was first exhibited in 1917. Duchamp simply found the urinal and called it art, much to the alarm of the artistic community at the time. The artists claimed that their action, which they called \"Two artists piss on Duchamp's Urinal\", was intended to make people re-evaluate what constituted art itself and how an act could be art. The pair were arrested after their \"artistic intervention\" on Tracey Emin's bed last year. However, they were later released without charge at the request of Ms Emin and the gallery.",

One man was in the cabin and the other two were on a platform outside. They were extending the arm when the accident happened just after 4pm. They had not been named last night.

Yesterday evening police were clearing onlookers and cordoning off the area where the remains of the crane arm, a smashed tangle of red painted steel, lay sprawled across a normally busy thoroughfare. The tower of the crane remained standing exactly as it had been before the accident. Firefighters said the scene was being preserved intact for investigators.

      "byline": "Rupert Smith",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The sinking feeling that usually accompanies documentaries about gifted disabled children was entirely absent from <strong> Tito's Story</strong> (BBC1, Sunday), a hardnosed and utterly disarming study of autism. Eleven-year-old Tito lives in Bangalore and spends much of his time in a rigorous programme of education with his mother Soma, the very embodiment of tough love. She gets him to his desk every morning, puts him through his academic paces and battles with his inability to concentrate - then, lessons over, she takes him out on pleasure trips that more closely resemble military exercises. It works, though; instead of sitting in his room unable to communicate, like many autistic children, Tito writes articulate and occasionally profound poetry, showing verbal skills far greater than the average 11-year-old. </p> <p>Chris Terrill's film followed Tito and Soma through the weeks preceding a trip to London at the invitation of the National Autistic Society. Tito, in full hyper mode, caused havoc at school. Eventually, in a three-way interview with Terrill and a therapist, with Soma \"translating\" his garbled words where necessary, Tito blurted out the root of his anxiety. \"Will the audience laugh at me? Do I look mad?\" The answer, of course, was no - by this time Terrill's methods had taken us to the heart of Tito's world, and we could ignore the surface twitches and see, instead, an intelligence of seemingly unlimited potential. </p> <p>Terrill is a clever operator; whatever his subject (HMS Brilliant, Soho Stories) he uses minimal technical resources to get close to the core in double-quick time. While so many documentaries substitute flashy effects for insight, Terrill's low-tech approach focuses relentlessly on the human experience. And in Tito, as in previous productions, he struck gold. The psychiatrists at the National Autistic Society, professional sceptics to a woman, sat in awe as Tito riffed through a few spontaneous poems and then casually demonstrated his understanding of words like \"marsupial\", \"geriatric\" and \"prestigious\". By the time his attention ran out and he went haring off to the kitchen to play with the light switches, the experts were staring in slack-jawed disbelief at this prodigy, struggling to reconcile Tito's typically autistic behaviour with his profound verbal insights. </p> <p>Art Malik intoned Tito's poems with a suitable degree of artlessness, but it was Tito himself who stole the show. Driving into London in a taxi, he asked the driver: \"Where are your cows?\" After his triumphant demonstration to the doctors, he announced: \"I deserve a biscuit.\" In the hands of a lesser director, this might have been mawkish fare, but Terrill kept sentiment at bay and chose merely to observe. It was more than enough. </p> <p>Technique sadly interposed itself between viewer and subject in BBC2's Saturday night offering, <strong> Arena: The Veil </strong> . What set out to be an exploration of Muslim women and their attitude towards \"hijab\", the covering of the head and face, lost itself in a welter of visual trickery. Film was seen spooling through edit suites, video footage was reshot in close-up to fragment the image. Perhaps this was meant to make a point about an image-obsessed media, or perhaps something entirely different.

      "bodyText": "The sinking feeling that usually accompanies documentaries about gifted disabled children was entirely absent from Tito's Story (BBC1, Sunday), a hardnosed and utterly disarming study of autism. Eleven-year-old Tito lives in Bangalore and spends much of his time in a rigorous programme of education with his mother Soma, the very embodiment of tough love. She gets him to his desk every morning, puts him through his academic paces and battles with his inability to concentrate - then, lessons over, she takes him out on pleasure trips that more closely resemble military exercises. It works, though; instead of sitting in his room unable to communicate, like many autistic children, Tito writes articulate and occasionally profound poetry, showing verbal skills far greater than the average 11-year-old. Chris Terrill's film followed Tito and Soma through the weeks preceding a trip to London at the invitation of the National Autistic Society. Tito, in full hyper mode, caused havoc at school. Eventually, in a three-way interview with Terrill and a therapist, with Soma \"translating\" his garbled words where necessary, Tito blurted out the root of his anxiety. \"Will the audience laugh at me? Do I look mad?\" The answer, of course, was no - by this time Terrill's methods had taken us to the heart of Tito's world, and we could ignore the surface twitches and see, instead, an intelligence of seemingly unlimited potential. Terrill is a clever operator; whatever his subject (HMS Brilliant, Soho Stories) he uses minimal technical resources to get close to the core in double-quick time. While so many documentaries substitute flashy effects for insight, Terrill's low-tech approach focuses relentlessly on the human experience. And in Tito, as in previous productions, he struck gold. The psychiatrists at the National Autistic Society, professional sceptics to a woman, sat in awe as Tito riffed through a few spontaneous poems and then casually demonstrated his understanding of words like \"marsupial\", \"geriatric\" and \"prestigious\". By the time his attention ran out and he went haring off to the kitchen to play with the light switches, the experts were staring in slack-jawed disbelief at this prodigy, struggling to reconcile Tito's typically autistic behaviour with his profound verbal insights. Art Malik intoned Tito's poems with a suitable degree of artlessness, but it was Tito himself who stole the show. Driving into London in a taxi, he asked the driver: \"Where are your cows?\" After his triumphant demonstration to the doctors, he announced: \"I deserve a biscuit.\" In the hands of a lesser director, this might have been mawkish fare, but Terrill kept sentiment at bay and chose merely to observe. It was more than enough. Technique sadly interposed itself between viewer and subject in BBC2's Saturday night offering, Arena: The Veil . What set out to be an exploration of Muslim women and their attitude towards \"hijab\", the covering of the head and face, lost itself in a welter of visual trickery. Film was seen spooling through edit suites, video footage was reshot in close-up to fragment the image. Perhaps this was meant to make a point about an image-obsessed media, or perhaps something entirely different. Perhaps the producer was just obsessed by the edit suite. This was a shame, because the subject of hijab is intriguing to Muslim and non-Muslim viewers alike, arousing puzzlement and passion in equal measure. The thoughts of young Muslim women who had chosen to wear the veil hinted at a vast range of hidden experience, ranging from religious mysticism to downright fear. \"You have to protect yourself - the more I cover myself, the less fear I feel,\" said the voice-over, collated from interviews with a number of subjects who declined, for obvious reasons, to appear on TV.

The current season, which opened on Saturday with a new production of Mozart's Le Nozze di Figaro, is the last that will involve Andrew Davis as music director and Graham Vick as director of productions. </p> <p>Snowman and the younger Christie have plans. No replacements for Vick and Davis have yet been announced, and it seems there will be no overall directorial control. Snowman is intent on expanding the repertory, promising to test the capacity of the house with Verdi's Otello and Wagner's Tristan, and to bring more new works into the repertory.

Instead of a production style defined by one person, as for the past decade, there will be a richer mix. This Figaro shows that it is just about time for those changes. Glyndebourne badly needs new theatrical blood. </p> <p>With the new Mozarts this season (Don Giovanni follows in July), Davis and Vick complete the trilogy of the Da Ponte operas they began in 1998 with Cosi Fan Tutte, an appropriate way to end their partnership in a house that has always prided itself on its Mozart. But there is little pride to be gained from the new show. On the first night Davis conducted the score rather lumpishly (why has Glyndebourne returned to performing Mozart with a modern orchestra - the London Philharmonic - rather than period instruments?). And if the Cosi was a dull, unperceptive affair, the Figaro continues in the same vein, with a staging that is low on humour, sex and politics. </p> <p>Richard Hudson's basic set from 1998 - off-white walls and old-fashioned radiators, like a trendy loft conversion - returns, with the specifics of Almaviva's castle suggested by gilded chairs, gauze-panel walls and cut-out doorways, so every entrance is visually anticipated. Apart from a baffling array of cardboard boxes, first impressions are of calm elegance, but with such a monochrome setting the characters need to supply some vitality - and they just don't, though there are two fine performances, one of them life-saving as far as the evening is concerned. </p> <p>Peter Mattei's Figaro is the star of the evening. Handsome, commanding and vocally expert, he is a natural stage creature; his arias in the first and fourth acts are the moments when the performance really takes wing. But he is surrounded by very average contributions. Christiane Oelze is miscast as Susanna: all she can offer is pert prissiness that is neither physically nor vocally seductive. One wonders why the Count should bother with her, but he is portrayed by Mariusz Kwiecen as a bully with no charm in his manner or his singing. Maria Costanza Nocentini's Countess is striking to behold, rather wan to hear, while Marina Comparato's Cherubino rushes around like a hamster on heat. There are perfectly proficient but utterly conventional depictions of Bartolo and Basilio from Andrew Shore and Ryland Davies, but a fine, glamorous Marcellina from Diana Montague. </p> <p>In a better production Mattei and Montague would prosper; here the odds are stacked against them.

So it comes as no surprise that their latest show The Car Man (directed and choreographed, as always, by Matthew Bourne) involves yet another classic (Bizet's opera Carmen) in yet another drastic change of sex. </p> <p>Instead of being set around a cigarette factory in 19th-century Spain, the story has been relocated to a garage in small town America circa 1960. This means that in place of Bizet's original chorus of feisty, flirty factory girls Bourne has a group of muscled grease monkeys, and instead of a gypsy seductress as the mainspring of the action there is a charismatic drifter called Luca. </p> <p>But even though Bourne uses Bizet as a starting point (Rodion Shchredin's Carmen Suite intercut with new music by Terry Davies), his staging involves much more than a simple flipping of gender and place. The Car Man's story of cuckoldry, murder and erotic treachery may contain powerful echoes of Carmen, but these collide with resonances from many other sources, including Greek tragedy, Bourne's own Swan lake and Hollywood film noir (hence the dreadful pun of the subtitle: \"Auto-erotic Thriller). </p> <p>This new plot is much too good to give away, but its sharp changes of emotional gear build to a rare edge-of-the-seat urgency. It's also peopled with characters of winning interest and complexity. All this is presented through a body language so bright with wit and so fraught with emotional subtext that it's hard to believe not a line of dialogue has been uttered. </p> <p>Part of the production credit must go to designer Lez Brotherston, whose recreation of 60s America is so visceral you can almost feel the heat that has the dancers languid with sweat or twitching with sexual energy. Bourne plugs into the macho charge of this scenery with choreography that's especially good for the men. Their group dances are animated with a vernacular wit and pulse. The pivotal duets, violent and erotic, are even better, and bring out performances so intense you sometimes want to look away. </p> <p>Alan Vincent as Luca is a fine dancer but he brings with him a sense of past history, a patina of grit that has nothing to do with the dance studio.

      "bodyText": "Adventures in Motion Pictures became famous as the dance group who turned Swan Lake into a ballet for the boys. So it comes as no surprise that their latest show The Car Man (directed and choreographed, as always, by Matthew Bourne) involves yet another classic (Bizet's opera Carmen) in yet another drastic change of sex. Instead of being set around a cigarette factory in 19th-century Spain, the story has been relocated to a garage in small town America circa 1960. This means that in place of Bizet's original chorus of feisty, flirty factory girls Bourne has a group of muscled grease monkeys, and instead of a gypsy seductress as the mainspring of the action there is a charismatic drifter called Luca. But even though Bourne uses Bizet as a starting point (Rodion Shchredin's Carmen Suite intercut with new music by Terry Davies), his staging involves much more than a simple flipping of gender and place. The Car Man's story of cuckoldry, murder and erotic treachery may contain powerful echoes of Carmen, but these collide with resonances from many other sources, including Greek tragedy, Bourne's own Swan lake and Hollywood film noir (hence the dreadful pun of the subtitle: \"Auto-erotic Thriller). This new plot is much too good to give away, but its sharp changes of emotional gear build to a rare edge-of-the-seat urgency. It's also peopled with characters of winning interest and complexity. All this is presented through a body language so bright with wit and so fraught with emotional subtext that it's hard to believe not a line of dialogue has been uttered. Part of the production credit must go to designer Lez Brotherston, whose recreation of 60s America is so visceral you can almost feel the heat that has the dancers languid with sweat or twitching with sexual energy. Bourne plugs into the macho charge of this scenery with choreography that's especially good for the men. Their group dances are animated with a vernacular wit and pulse. The pivotal duets, violent and erotic, are even better, and bring out performances so intense you sometimes want to look away. Alan Vincent as Luca is a fine dancer but he brings with him a sense of past history, a patina of grit that has nothing to do with the dance studio. Will Kemp as the frail victimised Angelo dances even better, yet his rarefied moves reveal with startling clarity how this preppy introvert unravels into emotional chaos. Scott Ambler's cuckolded husband, a comic gem of farting, shambling horror, tips just the wrong side of caricature, but the single serious flaw in this otherwise magnificent show is the choreography for the women. Though Michela Meazza as the errant wife looks rivetingly like a white trash version of Sophia Loren, her dance sequences, like those of her wide-eyed, romantic sister, appear girlish and gawky, as if the anatomy of female desire isn't quite in Bourne's range. But AMP's shows have a good habit of growing and changing when they're out on the road, and The Car Man has a long tour before its London premiere in September. Since it's already so full of dramatic and choreographic juice, it's very likely going to run and run. The Car Man is at Sheffield Lyceum (0114-249 6000) from Tuesday.",

From an original 600 entrants, all under the age of 19, only 25 musicians remain, competing for one of five places in the final concert on Saturday. The winner will receive \u00a32,000 and go on to represent Britain in the Eurovision Young Musician in two weeks' time. </p> <p>The players who made it to the finals (divided into the categories brass, keyboard, woodwind, percussion and strings) represent some of the very best young musicians in the UK. Apart from fulfilling the basic requirements, such as having passed their Associated Board Grade 8 examination, they have already triumphed in regional auditions, regional finals and national semi-finals - a process that started a year ago. Simon Cosgrove, a saxophonist and A-level student from Pontefract, West Yorkshire, tells how he made it to the national finals, which were recorded by the BBC in February. </p> <p> <strong> May 13, 1999</strong> </p> <p> It was exciting to see the first BBC envelope slip through the letterbox this morning. It was only to let me know that my first round audition is on July 7, but now I know everything is officially underway. </p> <p>I have to send off a confirmation slip by June 5, otherwise I \"risk losing\" my audition date. I've already made one such mistake: when entering the competition, I forgot to enclose a copy of my Grade 8 certificate and had to sweet-talk the postman into letting me retrieve the application. </p> <p>I wasn't even sure whether to enter the competition: a background more in jazz than classical music and no specialist music education didn't seem the ideal cocktail for a competition of such classical prestige. Still, programming was fun. For the first round (a local audition at Leeds University), I've tried to strike a balance between French classical, contemporary and jazz music. Richard Ingham was a great help in that respect - it's great to have a teacher who is not just a sax specialist but also a vigilant and wise competition programmer. </p> <p> <strong> June 5</strong> </p> <p> Had a call from the BBC this morning wondering if I still wanted my audition as I hadn't returned my slip in time - oops. I assured them it would be in the post in minutes, so that wasn't a huge problem, just a bit embarrassing. Meanwhile, practice for July 7 beckons. </p> <p> <strong> July 7</strong> </p> <p> Today was quite an experience. I found communicating my music to a panel of three much more draining and intense than to an audience of thousands who don't have copies of my scores and the eyes of an eagle. It was also strange meeting other competitors in the waiting-room - it felt more like a dentist's surgery than preparation for a competition whose ethos is to give young musicians the chance to perform and be heard. Still, I had my chauffeur and two bodyguards to fuel my enthusiasm, aka my dad and two accompanists (it's hard to find one who is prepared to play both classical and jazz!), and the audition - 15 minutes' worth of music - went well. Perhaps not as well as it might, but the experience was invaluable </p> <p> <strong> July 26</strong> </p> <p> The practice must have paid off because I'm through to the regional finals. I'll have to up my usual practice schedule of about 40 minutes every other day quite a bit. Musically, I'm going for a similar format as round one, although this time I'm including a sprinkling of Baroque to make the blend of genres even more eclectic. </p> <p> <strong> September 23</strong> </p> <p> I was pleased with my performance at Manchester today, especially in view of the difficulties I had finding an accompanist. My usual accompanist had other commitments, so I had to call on good friend and proficient pianist Sam Breuning to fill his shoes. He rose to the challenge well and we were able to nail the pieces, pulling off a successful performance. I reached the regional finals of the competition when I entered in 1997, but I didn't get any further. Nor do I expect to this time, although the experience and determination is always there. It would be nice if I could reach the so-called \"safety net\", a pool stage in which a few of those who didn't make it straight through to the national semi-finals are re-judged using a tape of their performance. I'll just have to wait and see. </p> <p> <strong> October 2</strong> </p> <p> Ambition achieved - I've reached the safety net! </p> <p> <strong> November 1</strong> </p> <p> It's getting better - I've been picked up from the \"safety net\" and have reached the national semi-finals, which places me in the top 12 woodwind players in the competition. I've slacked off a bit, but practice will have to take top priority now. I have until December 23 to decide on a programme for the semi-finals. At least I don't have the added worry of finding another accompanist - Chris Ross, provided by the BBC, seems the obvious choice for me. </p> <p>Over the last few months, because I have had to try out so many pieces (you can only repeat one piece throughout the competition) my knowledge of the repertoire has grown. I also have a deeper understanding of conventional musical forms and how they can be presented. </p> <p> <strong> December 23</strong> </p> <p> Success! I have a place in the finals of what is perhaps the most prestigious competition for young musicians in the UK. Today was drawn-out. I arrived at the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester at 10 this morning, but wasn't on stage until 9.15pm, which was draining. Still, the weeks of endless practice obviously worked and I'm now facing a guaranteed TV appearance and an all-new finals programme. </p> <p>A lot of my presuppositions were shattered today, too. I found the BBC Young Musicians team to be incredibly friendly and helpful, and Chris Ross was fantastic. I expected a man who had toured the world more times than I'd washed the dishes at home to be quite eccentric and almost hostile, but he was amazing - musically, and in the way he made me feel at ease while offering constructive criticism. </p> <p>Programming music for this stage was a feat in itself. I must have spent hours on the phone to my teacher and to the BBC office deciding, then changing, deciding, then changing... I had almost run out of repertoire - suitable saxophone pieces are harder to find than, say, piano pieces - so having to decide on material for the semis and the finals was difficult. </p> <p>Support from family, friends and teachers has been second to none, while being a comprehensive 6th form college student with no real musical history in the family has generated interest locally. Not going to a private music school does have its drawbacks (such as having to use the freezing college sports hall to produce a makeshift concert hall acoustic), but reaching this far in the competition makes me feel more privileged and determined to succeed. </p> <p>I now have nine weeks to prepare three pieces that I've hardly seen before, so I'll be practising like mad - two-and-a-half hours' a day is the plan. In fact, the next two months will be incredibly busy - I have a trip to New Orleans with the Doncaster Jazz Orchestra in two weeks plus mock A-levels the week after. </p> <p> <strong> February 24, 2000</strong> </p> <p> Only a matter of hours now until I'm on stage in front of television cameras and an audience of hundreds. The last few weeks have been hectic but rewarding. I have been offered a place at Cambridge, and my time in New Orleans was fabulous. It was a huge international jazz festival, where I rubbed shoulders with the likes of Herbie Hancock. The experience I've gained from playing with the Doncaster Jazz Orchestra, under the leadership of vibrant conductor John Ellis, has been invaluable to my musical maturity, and led to me winning a national award for outstanding improvisation in 1998. </p> <p>I've been at the RNCM today having rehearsals with Chris Ross, as well as TV interviews. It sounds daunting, but the BBC Young Musicians team have been incredibly considerate, as has the camera crew. Taking part in this competition has been an experience I'll never forget. Even though I've been privileged enough to reach the finals, I've learned that success doesn't mean winning - in this case it means maturing as a musician and being prepared to communicate your work to an audience in such a way that they are grasped and moved by your playing. </p> <p>BBC Young Musician of the Year broadcasts on BBC2 from tonight, at 11.20pm. Simon Cosgrove appears on Friday. The Final Concert is broadcast on Saturday.</p>",

Arriving at a house in Rainham, Essex, to pick up two children, he found himself in the middle of a drugs raid.</p> <p>The police had just found about \u00a31m worth of heroin. They told Patel to send the children home by minicab. They strip-searched him, and took him to be questioned at Romford police station.</p> <p>Patel stood trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court and was given a four-year prison sentence. His life was in ruins; his promising career as a banker in the City of London was over. This month the Crown finally conceded that there wasn't a scrap of evidence against him.</p> <p>\"When you look at the case in detail,\" explained his solicitor, Jane Hickman, \"you can see that Mr Patel has been let down by every part of the criminal justice system.\"</p> <p>Patel, 44, came to this country in 1977 from India and enthusiastically adopted the ways of his host country. He became westernised in every way, and even passed the Lord Tebbit nationality test: he supported England at cricket.</p> <p>He joined the Muslim Commercial Bank, won a series of rapid promotions and became the bank's accountant. The bank depended on Asian businessmen, and staff were instructed to foster social contacts - which explained Patel's arrival at the house of Mohamedali Ramjanali, later sentenced to 16 years for possessing heroin with intent to supply.</p> <p>Patel was charged with leaking information prejudicial to their inquiry into the drugs case, suggesting that he had enabled the drug dealers to protect their assets. There were two strands of evidence against him. The first concerned supposed admissions he had made during two interviews. There was no record of the first interview, although there was an ostensibly contemporaneous record of the second.</p> <p>The second strand of evidence only emerged at trial, when the investigating officer told the jury that \"certain inquiries we did make in Lisbon reflected directly communication being made from London by Mr Patel\".</p> <p>This evidence, however damaging, was vague, but it was put in more concrete terms by the judge. In his summing-up, he said that \"the investigation had in fact been compromised by information being leaked from London\". This embellishment was itself further embellished at appeal by the then Lord Chief Justice, Lord Lane, who commented that the investigation had been \"grossly compromised\" by the leak.</p> <p>After his release in 1990, Patel dedicated himself to getting his conviction quashed. He had first been refused permission to appeal in March 1988. In February 1989, a full three-judge court turned down his appeal, but neither Patel nor his lawyers had been informed about the hearing. The appeal was heard again in March 1990, and again turned down.</p> <p>Hickman's concern was twofold: that her client had been convicted on spurious evidence; and that his barrister had failed to challenge the admissibility of the interviews, and had told Patel he could not criticise the police. Although Patel's instructions throughout were that the police had fabricated the interviews, the barrister told his client to say in the witness box that he \"couldn't remember\" the key questions and answers, seriously weakening Patel's credibility.</p> <p>Hickman obtained the records of the second interview and sent them for electrostatic document analysis (ESDA) tests. These proved that, at the critical point, the pages had been re-written, supporting Patel's claims that the self-incriminating remarks were fabricated.</p> <p>But the Crown Prosecution Service refused to release documents indicating Patel had leaked information, claiming they were protected by public interest immunity (PII) certificates. In June 1993, Hickman urged the Home Secretary, Kenneth Clarke, to refer the case to appeal. The Home Office asked the Police Complaints Authority to supervise an investigation into the case. Its report was delivered in May 1996. Hickman sent a fresh submission to the Home Secretary - by then Michael Howard - and the case was referred to appeal in November 1996.</p> <p>Innumerable delays followed before the case was finally listed for hearing this month. Forty-eight hours before the hearing on May 11, the CPS finally threw in the towel. They conceded that the judge in his summing-up had misreported what the police officer said, and that what the police officer had said wasn't true. The information that had supposedly been covered by PII for at least the previous eight years simply didn't exist.</p> <p>\"The Crown were prepared to concede that there was no evidence of money movements, that there was no evidence at all of leaking, and that there had been tampering with the interviews,\" said Hickman. \"If they were prepared to concede all that now, why did we have to wait all these years?\"</p> <p>Patel wept quietly in court as his conviction was quashed. \"They can't give him back his career, or the 13 years he's lost, or his peace of mind,\" said Hickman. \"I don't know how you can ever compensate anybody for all that.\"</p>",

There was no record of the first interview, although there was an ostensibly contemporaneous record of the second. The second strand of evidence only emerged at trial, when the investigating officer told the jury that \"certain inquiries we did make in Lisbon reflected directly communication being made from London by Mr Patel\". This evidence, however damaging, was vague, but it was put in more concrete terms by the judge. In his summing-up, he said that \"the investigation had in fact been compromised by information being leaked from London\". This embellishment was itself further embellished at appeal by the then Lord Chief Justice, Lord Lane, who commented that the investigation had been \"grossly compromised\" by the leak. After his release in 1990, Patel dedicated himself to getting his conviction quashed. He had first been refused permission to appeal in March 1988. In February 1989, a full three-judge court turned down his appeal, but neither Patel nor his lawyers had been informed about the hearing. The appeal was heard again in March 1990, and again turned down. Hickman's concern was twofold: that her client had been convicted on spurious evidence; and that his barrister had failed to challenge the admissibility of the interviews, and had told Patel he could not criticise the police. Although Patel's instructions throughout were that the police had fabricated the interviews, the barrister told his client to say in the witness box that he \"couldn't remember\" the key questions and answers, seriously weakening Patel's credibility. Hickman obtained the records of the second interview and sent them for electrostatic document analysis (ESDA) tests. These proved that, at the critical point, the pages had been re-written, supporting Patel's claims that the self-incriminating remarks were fabricated. But the Crown Prosecution Service refused to release documents indicating Patel had leaked information, claiming they were protected by public interest immunity (PII) certificates. In June 1993, Hickman urged the Home Secretary, Kenneth Clarke, to refer the case to appeal. The Home Office asked the Police Complaints Authority to supervise an investigation into the case. Its report was delivered in May 1996. Hickman sent a fresh submission to the Home Secretary - by then Michael Howard - and the case was referred to appeal in November 1996. Innumerable delays followed before the case was finally listed for hearing this month. Forty-eight hours before the hearing on May 11, the CPS finally threw in the towel. They conceded that the judge in his summing-up had misreported what the police officer said, and that what the police officer had said wasn't true. The information that had supposedly been covered by PII for at least the previous eight years simply didn't exist. \"The Crown were prepared to concede that there was no evidence of money movements, that there was no evidence at all of leaking, and that there had been tampering with the interviews,\" said Hickman. \"If they were prepared to concede all that now, why did we have to wait all these years?\" Patel wept quietly in court as his conviction was quashed. \"They can't give him back his career, or the 13 years he's lost, or his peace of mind,\" said Hickman. \"I don't know how you can ever compensate anybody for all that.\"",

And now he has won the Royal Gold Medal for Architecture, a gift awarded on behalf of the Queen by the Royal Institute of British Architecture, and still, despite the big bucks attached to newer international prizes, the most prestigious of its kind. The citation reads: \"No one who believes in the power of architecture as a creative and artistic force can deny the contribution which has already been made by this master architect who, at the age of 71, is still at the height of his powers as a designer.\" </p> <p>He is currently planning or building the Walt Disney Concert Hall, Los Angeles, the Maggie Jencks memorial cancer care centre, Dundee, and Manhattan's second, if putative, Guggenheim. Each will be a fully operational building and yet each is also a highly striking and idiosyncratic sculpture. Architects working in this way have been rare and not always successful. Quirky buildings are often just that: oddballs, curios, rococo fantasmagoria that quickly pall and become labelled, at best, as the work of wilful eccentrics. </p> <p>Gehry shares a part of the terrain occupied in the past century by the likes of Antoni Gaudi (the patron saint of Barcelona in all but name, but even that may not be far off), Frank Lloyd Wright (architect of the existing Guggenheim Museum, New York), Le Corbusier in his late, raw concrete days - Gehry was influenced by Corbu's sublime pilgrimage chapel at Ronchamp - and in the work of younger talents such as Daniel Libeskind's Jewish Museum in Berlin last year and Zaha Hadid's forthcoming Museum of Contemporary Art in Rome. </p> <p>Gehry is not a man to follow conventional wisdom and enjoys talking out of turn. It is fun to hear a great architect tell us that, \"Palladio faced a fork in the road, and he took the wrong turn.\" Could he mean Andrea Palladio, maestro of imposed and superimposed geometry and probably the most influential architect of all time? Sure, says Gehry: \"He should have recognised that there's chaos; he should have gone ahead and done what Borromoni did. He would have been a pioneer.\" </p> <p>What Francesco Borromoni did was to twist, turn, push, pull and stretch every sinew of the corpus of classical architecture until he had transformed it into something as extraordinary, inimitable and as apparently chaotic as the supra-Baroque church of San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane in Rome. Gehry has done to modern architecture what Borromini did to classical. But he didn't escape from what he saw as the constraints of classical modernism. His way to international fame in the 70s was along the wibbly-wobbly road of post-modernism, mapped out by Robert Venturi in his book Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture and recorded so cleverly by Gehry's own chum Charles Jencks in The Language of Post-Modern Architecture. </p> <p>Where post-modernism led to a truly complex and contradictory pot-pourri, Gehry created a language of his own, richer yet more lucid with every new project. He is, says his friend Kurt W Forster of the Getty Research Centre, \"a player whose desire for acceptance is forever in conflict with his drive for distinction\". And in that gap lurks genius. </p> <p>Like many architectural geniuses, Gehry found conventional study problematic. He didn't get on at graduate school at Harvard, finding it pretentious and doctrinaire. He left to work with various practices in Los Angeles and Paris before building his own famous deconstructed, ragamuffin house in Santa Monica (1977-78) and teaming up with Claes Oldenburg and Richard Serra, among other big-spirited artists. He also began to draw fish, design buildings that looked like fish, and aim at what he sees as the perfection of the fish. This is where Gehry's work needs to be assessed by a psychoanalyst rather than a critic. </p> <p>But don't be put off by the fishing expedition: you only need to look at the Bilbao Guggenheim, with its titanium scales and long waggling tail to see, if not understand, how Gehry's obsession with fish has led to an architecture everyone is drawn to, as they are by the sight of exotic fish in a brightly lit aquarium. The Fishdance restaurant in Kobe, Japan (1986-87) is just that: a 70ft chain-link mesh fish dances on its tail next to the main building. </p> <p>Gehry's buildings became increasingly innovative as he gained confidence in the 80s. The Vitra International Design Museum, Weil-am-Rheim, Germany (1987-89) was the first of the real swooping, roller coaster designs that have become the architect's trademark. The Guggenheim followed (1991-97). There have been many others - among at least 250 projects altogether - wrapped around, before, after and in between. </p> <p>Then there's the furniture, notably the super-curvy bentwood chairs for Knoll and the cardboard stuff for Vitra. There's the Cond\u00e9 Nast cafeteria, New York, the projected city gate entrance to Venice beside the airport, and now the breathtaking Experience Museum Project (1996-2000), nearly complete alongside the Space Needle in downtown Seattle, a music centre shaped loosely in the guise of a shattered Fender Stratocaster and dedicated mostly to the Strat-licks and memory of the late Jimi Hendrix. </p> <p>Gehry's achievement is a great one. He has given us playful, powerful, memorable and enjoyable buildings that weave together history, popular culture, the obsessions of contemporary art and a belief he shares with the Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer, who won the Gold Medal in 1997, that \"architecture must be constant invention\".

Joanne is a finance assistant with a housing association, and Ian works for a distillery. </p> <p><b> At:</b> Royal Maternity Hospital Glasgow. </p> <p><b> Care: </b> It's a crowded site, but the new hospital is due to open next year. Like most women in Britain, Joanne had shared care, seeing her GP and a community midwife at alternate check-ups. </p> <p><b> The birth:</b> Joanne's pregnancy was straightforward, but as she has rhesus negative blood she was in a \"high risk\" group. Her waters broke on Friday at 8pm and she went straight to the hospital. The baby was born 10 hours later by ventouse. Joanne expects to have four months' maternity leave, as she did with her son after his birth. </p> <p><b> Hopes for the future:</b> \"I just hope she has a happy life.\" <br> <b>2: Bethany Elliot</b><br><br><b> Born: </b> 2.05am. </p> <p><b> Parents:</b> Claire and Stuart Elliott, both police officers. Claire is 27, Stuart is 33, and they live in a large three-bedroomed flat in Bexley. </p> <p><b> At:</b> Queen Mary's hospital, Sidcup. </p> <p><b> Care:</b> 1968-built hospital with a large maternity unit - 3,800 deliveries a year. Forward-looking approach - midwives don't wear uniforms. Home births are on the increase, and the caesarean section rate is around 25%. </p> <p><b> The birth:</b> \"It was really hard work, but it all went very well. I already knew both Deirdre, my main midwife, and Barbara, the student midwife - that helped such a lot. I've got an old back injury, so I wanted to deliver standing up to put less pressure on it, and they gave me lots of help to achieve that. I've had lots of help with breastfeeding and several midwives I saw antenatally have popped in to see us.\" </p> <p><b> Hopes for the future:</b> \"I just want her to be happy and healthy and to enjoy every moment of what's ahead.\" <br><br><b>3: Jessica Rose Thompson</b><br><br> <b> Born: </b> 1.12am. </p> <p><b> Parents: </b> Kathryne Garett, 24, legal secretary, and partner Calvin Thompson, 24, an alarm engineer, already have one daughter, Ellie-May, two. </p> <p><b> At:</b> Kingston Hospital, Surrey </p> <p><b> Type of maternity care: </b> Births at Kingston have increased dramatically over the past few years, and the hospital now has 4,800 deliveries annually. The maternity unit, built in 1995, has state-of-the-art LDRP rooms (labour, delivery, recovery, postpartum) - you stay in the same room for your labour, delivery and aftercare, although Kingston is so popular that it's often not possible to stay put after the birth and you're moved to another single room with its own en-suite bathroom. \"You couldn't get better if you were paying,\" says Kathryne. Midwives work in teams, so there's a good chance a woman in labour will be attended by a staff member she's met already. </p> <p><b> How the birth went:</b> \"The consultant was going to see if he could turn the baby next week, but I went into labour natually so it had to be an emergency caesarean. I'd been dreading having to have a caesarean - I was hoping the baby would turn and I could have a normal birth, but when I went into labour there was no other way. I had an epidural and I was really impressed with how Mary, my midwife, talked me through the whole thing. There were drapes up so I couldn't see the actual operation, but she told me everything as it happened. Once the baby was born she was put onto my chest and that was a wonderful moment. It was very different from my earlier normal delivery, but the first time you see your baby, that's something that doesn't change however she's delivered.\" </p> <p><b> Hopes for the future:</b> \"I want her to have the best education going. I want her to enjoy the things she does, like my little girl Ellie does already.\" <br><br> <b> 4: Adam Bile</b></p> <p> <b> Born: </b> 7.10am. </p> <p><b> Parents: </b> Efi Bile, 26, originally from West Africa, is a business studies </p> <p>student, as is husband Elie Fofala, 28.

St Thomas' and Guy's hospitals merged in 1993, and around 5,500 babies are born there each year. Work is about to start on a brand new maternity unit. </p> <p>Low and medium risk women are cared for by community-based midwifery teams, high risk women see consultants at the main hospitals. Caesarean section rate: around 20%. Some excellent community-based maternity clinics like Deptford Market, which has a 17% home birth rate and 91% of women have their baby delivered by a member of the team they know. </p> <p><b> The birth:</b> \"It was a very easy labour. I arrived at 5.30am and the baby was born less than two hours later. I hadn't met the midwife who delivered Adam but it didn't matter. He's gorgeous and he looks just like his dad.\" <br><br><b> 5: Layna Smyth</b></p> <p><b> Born: </b> 12.33am. </p> <p><b> Parents:</b> Antoinette Morelli, 24, a drama student at Queen's University in </p> <p>Belfast; Colin Smyth, 32, works for BT.

It seemed a long labour but I had a brilliant midwife - I'd never met her before, but she was fantastic. It was a forceps birth, so she's a bit swollen today, but it's going down and she's got a mass of hair like me.\" </p> <p><b> Hopes for the future:</b> \"Just to be holding my baby in my arms is enough for me. I just want to give her the best.\" <br><br><b> 6: Joshua Bracewell</b></p> <p> <b> Born: </b> 9.38am. </p> <p><b> Parents:</b> Helen Bracewell, 24, a travel agent, Stuart Parkin, 25, a car salesman. Couple live in a rented flat in the village of Thaxted outside Cambridge. Both sets of grandparents live nearby. </p> <p><b> At:</b> The Rosie Maternity Hospital at Addenbrooke's in Cambridge. </p> <p><b> Care:</b> The unit delivers around 5,000 babies a year. Care is community-based. Home birth rate hovers around 2%, which is national average. </p> <p><b> The birth:</b> \"I was looked after by the same midwife through my pregnancy at my GP's surgery, which was great - and I'll see her again once I'm home. I'd never met the midwife who delivered Joshua, but I don't think that mattered - she was brilliant.\" </p> <p><b> Hopes for the future: </b> \"I want to be able to provide for him, and to give him a safe and happy upbringing. We're just hoping we'll be able to afford to buy our own house so we get a garden for him to run around in.\" <br><br> <b>7: Scott Lee Rosser</b><br><br><b> Born: </b> 11.50am. </p> <p><b> Parents:</b> Sarah Charles, 18, and Mark Rosser, 36. Both unemployed, Sarah recently finished a nursery nursing course. Live in a flat on a council estate. </p> <p><b> Born at:</b> Newport Hospital, Gwent. </p> <p><b> Type of maternity care:</b> Sarah had shared care, seeing her doctor and a midwife at his surgery. She also had check-ups at the hospital itself. </p> <p><b> How the birth went:</b> \"I was on the pill so finding myself pregnant was a big shock - especially for Mark, as he's already got two childen. Once I got over it and told my mum and everyone, though, I got quite excited. I can't remember meeting the midwife before the birth, but it didn't make a lot of difference. I went into labour during the night on Friday, and at 5am Iwent over to my mum's. She and Mark both came with me to the hospital, but there they said I was only in the early stages. They sent mum and Mark home and I had a little nap. Then I woke up with this awful pain and they called them back in quick. Scott was born soon afterwards. When the baby was born he had the cord wrapped round his neck but they dealt with it really quickly and with no panic at all. Now I'm in a nice four-bedded ward now with Scott and it's very pleasant: I've got a lovely view from my window. The postnatal care seems fine, there are plenty of midwives around to ask questions if you need anything. Scott has been fine since he was born - he seems very tired and he's slept a lot, I've given him a couple of bottles and he seems contented.\" </p> <p><b> Hopes for the future:</b> \"I hope he makes more of his life than I have. I hope he concentrates more in school and makes the most of the opportunities that come his way.\" <br><br> <b>8: Jack Picton </b></p> <p><b> Born: </b> 4.57am. </p> <p><b> Parents:</b> Maxine Picton, 33, a TV cabinet packer. Partner Tony Wilkinson, 46, a textile mill worker. Maxine lives with her mum in Ovenden, a former council estate outside Halifax town centre. </p> <p><b> At:</b> Halifax General Hospital. </p> <p><b> Care:</b> During her pregnancy Maxine saw a community midwife at her GP's surgery, and also attended the hospital antenatal clinic. </p> <p>The Halifax General is a large, Victorian hospital and 2,500 babies are born there each year. </p> <p>High point: its a midwife-run GP unit - \"the next best thing to having a baby at home\" - where women can have natural deliveries in a low-tech environment. </p> <p>Low point: an old Victorian site, though it's about to be redeveloped. </p> <p><b> The birth: </b> \"I'd never met the midwife who delivered Jack, but she was fine. They've treated me well, I've been OK. Getting pregnant was a shock - we weren't planning a baby, but once we knew, I got used to the idea.\" </p> <p><b> Hopes for the future:</b> \"I've been brought up well - I've never been in trouble with the police or been on drugs or anything like that.

      "bodyText": "1: Baby McCabe Born: 6.36am. Parents: Joanne McCabe and Ian Macmillan, both 29, from Glasgow. They already have a two-year-old son, Cameron. Joanne is a finance assistant with a housing association, and Ian works for a distillery. At: Royal Maternity Hospital Glasgow. Care: It's a crowded site, but the new hospital is due to open next year. Like most women in Britain, Joanne had shared care, seeing her GP and a community midwife at alternate check-ups. The birth: Joanne's pregnancy was straightforward, but as she has rhesus negative blood she was in a \"high risk\" group. Her waters broke on Friday at 8pm and she went straight to the hospital. The baby was born 10 hours later by ventouse. Joanne expects to have four months' maternity leave, as she did with her son after his birth. Hopes for the future: \"I just hope she has a happy life.\" 2: Bethany Elliot Born: 2.05am. Parents: Claire and Stuart Elliott, both police officers. Claire is 27, Stuart is 33, and they live in a large three-bedroomed flat in Bexley. At: Queen Mary's hospital, Sidcup. Care: 1968-built hospital with a large maternity unit - 3,800 deliveries a year. Forward-looking approach - midwives don't wear uniforms. Home births are on the increase, and the caesarean section rate is around 25%. The birth: \"It was really hard work, but it all went very well. I already knew both Deirdre, my main midwife, and Barbara, the student midwife - that helped such a lot. I've got an old back injury, so I wanted to deliver standing up to put less pressure on it, and they gave me lots of help to achieve that. I've had lots of help with breastfeeding and several midwives I saw antenatally have popped in to see us.\" Hopes for the future: \"I just want her to be happy and healthy and to enjoy every moment of what's ahead.\" 3: Jessica Rose Thompson Born: 1.12am. Parents: Kathryne Garett, 24, legal secretary, and partner Calvin Thompson, 24, an alarm engineer, already have one daughter, Ellie-May, two. At: Kingston Hospital, Surrey Type of maternity care: Births at Kingston have increased dramatically over the past few years, and the hospital now has 4,800 deliveries annually. The maternity unit, built in 1995, has state-of-the-art LDRP rooms (labour, delivery, recovery, postpartum) - you stay in the same room for your labour, delivery and aftercare, although Kingston is so popular that it's often not possible to stay put after the birth and you're moved to another single room with its own en-suite bathroom. \"You couldn't get better if you were paying,\" says Kathryne. Midwives work in teams, so there's a good chance a woman in labour will be attended by a staff member she's met already. How the birth went: \"The consultant was going to see if he could turn the baby next week, but I went into labour natually so it had to be an emergency caesarean. I'd been dreading having to have a caesarean - I was hoping the baby would turn and I could have a normal birth, but when I went into labour there was no other way. I had an epidural and I was really impressed with how Mary, my midwife, talked me through the whole thing. There were drapes up so I couldn't see the actual operation, but she told me everything as it happened. Once the baby was born she was put onto my chest and that was a wonderful moment. It was very different from my earlier normal delivery, but the first time you see your baby, that's something that doesn't change however she's delivered.\" Hopes for the future: \"I want her to have the best education going. I want her to enjoy the things she does, like my little girl Ellie does already.\" 4: Adam Bile Born: 7.10am. Parents: Efi Bile, 26, originally from West Africa, is a business studies student, as is husband Elie Fofala, 28. They live in New Cross. At: Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital, London. Care: If Cherie had chosen her nearest hospital, it would have been St Thomas', opposite the Houses of Parliament on London's south bank. St Thomas' and Guy's hospitals merged in 1993, and around 5,500 babies are born there each year. Work is about to start on a brand new maternity unit. Low and medium risk women are cared for by community-based midwifery teams, high risk women see consultants at the main hospitals. Caesarean section rate: around 20%. Some excellent community-based maternity clinics like Deptford Market, which has a 17% home birth rate and 91% of women have their baby delivered by a member of the team they know. The birth: \"It was a very easy labour. I arrived at 5.30am and the baby was born less than two hours later. I hadn't met the midwife who delivered Adam but it didn't matter. He's gorgeous and he looks just like his dad.\" 5: Layna Smyth Born: 12.33am. Parents: Antoinette Morelli, 24, a drama student at Queen's University in Belfast; Colin Smyth, 32, works for BT. Live on the Lisburn Road in Belfast. \"We hadn't intended starting a family yet, but we're delighted.\" At: Royal Maternity Hospital, Belfast. Care: At 30%, the caesarean rate is well above average, as is the induction rate of 38%. The birth: Antoinette was taken in on Friday morning for an induction. \"The baby was due 11 days ago, so they thought they needed to give me a move on. It seemed a long labour but I had a brilliant midwife - I'd never met her before, but she was fantastic. It was a forceps birth, so she's a bit swollen today, but it's going down and she's got a mass of hair like me.\" Hopes for the future: \"Just to be holding my baby in my arms is enough for me. I just want to give her the best.\" 6: Joshua Bracewell Born: 9.38am. Parents: Helen Bracewell, 24, a travel agent, Stuart Parkin, 25, a car salesman. Couple live in a rented flat in the village of Thaxted outside Cambridge. Both sets of grandparents live nearby. At: The Rosie Maternity Hospital at Addenbrooke's in Cambridge. Care: The unit delivers around 5,000 babies a year. Care is community-based. Home birth rate hovers around 2%, which is national average. The birth: \"I was looked after by the same midwife through my pregnancy at my GP's surgery, which was great - and I'll see her again once I'm home. I'd never met the midwife who delivered Joshua, but I don't think that mattered - she was brilliant.\" Hopes for the future: \"I want to be able to provide for him, and to give him a safe and happy upbringing. We're just hoping we'll be able to afford to buy our own house so we get a garden for him to run around in.\" 7: Scott Lee Rosser Born: 11.50am. Parents: Sarah Charles, 18, and Mark Rosser, 36. Both unemployed, Sarah recently finished a nursery nursing course. Live in a flat on a council estate. Born at: Newport Hospital, Gwent. Type of maternity care: Sarah had shared care, seeing her doctor and a midwife at his surgery. She also had check-ups at the hospital itself. How the birth went: \"I was on the pill so finding myself pregnant was a big shock - especially for Mark, as he's already got two childen. Once I got over it and told my mum and everyone, though, I got quite excited. I can't remember meeting the midwife before the birth, but it didn't make a lot of difference. I went into labour during the night on Friday, and at 5am Iwent over to my mum's. She and Mark both came with me to the hospital, but there they said I was only in the early stages. They sent mum and Mark home and I had a little nap. Then I woke up with this awful pain and they called them back in quick. Scott was born soon afterwards. When the baby was born he had the cord wrapped round his neck but they dealt with it really quickly and with no panic at all. Now I'm in a nice four-bedded ward now with Scott and it's very pleasant: I've got a lovely view from my window. The postnatal care seems fine, there are plenty of midwives around to ask questions if you need anything. Scott has been fine since he was born - he seems very tired and he's slept a lot, I've given him a couple of bottles and he seems contented.\" Hopes for the future: \"I hope he makes more of his life than I have. I hope he concentrates more in school and makes the most of the opportunities that come his way.\" 8: Jack Picton Born: 4.57am. Parents: Maxine Picton, 33, a TV cabinet packer. Partner Tony Wilkinson, 46, a textile mill worker. Maxine lives with her mum in Ovenden, a former council estate outside Halifax town centre. At: Halifax General Hospital. Care: During her pregnancy Maxine saw a community midwife at her GP's surgery, and also attended the hospital antenatal clinic. The Halifax General is a large, Victorian hospital and 2,500 babies are born there each year. High point: its a midwife-run GP unit - \"the next best thing to having a baby at home\" - where women can have natural deliveries in a low-tech environment. Low point: an old Victorian site, though it's about to be redeveloped. The birth: \"I'd never met the midwife who delivered Jack, but she was fine. They've treated me well, I've been OK. Getting pregnant was a shock - we weren't planning a baby, but once we knew, I got used to the idea.\" Hopes for the future: \"I've been brought up well - I've never been in trouble with the police or been on drugs or anything like that. I'm going to do the same for Jack, I'll make a good job of it.\" 9: Emily Rose Hale Born: 7.58am. Parents: Sheila Hale, 35, a school cook, and husband Graeme. Sheila already has a 12-year-old daughter, Leanne, and a 14-year-old son, Christopher. But Emily is a first baby for Graeme, and he's \"over the moon\". At: Weston General, Weston super Mare. Care: The Weston is a small unit, with just 400 deliveries a year. There are no facilities for caesareans, so only takes \"low risk\" mothers. Around 2% of those are born at home. It offers aromatherapy in pregnancy and birth as well as the now almost standard birthing pool. The birth: \"It was a long labour, which was quite a surprise because with Leanne I was only in labour for three hours. It's 12 years since I last had a baby, and also like her I had a long labour - it started around 11.30pm on Friday night.\" Hopes for the future: \"We'd just like her to be healthy and happy.\" 10: Alexander FitzGerald Born: 5.30pm. Parents: Lauren, 29, and Patrick, 34, FitzGerald. Both Australians who came to live in London last year - she's a commercial lawyer, he's an IT consultant. Just moved (on Friday!) into a flat in Blackheath. At: Greenwich Hospital, with the help of independent midwife Dorothy Norris. Care: There are around 50 independent midwives in the UK. They commit themselves to be with you at the birth. The birth: Lauren was three weeks overdue, so the baby was induced. \"Dorothy stayed with us throughout,\" says Patrick. \"When things didn't quite go to plan, we had to make quick decisions about an assisted delivery - Alexander was born using forceps - and it was invaluable having someone we knew we could trust .\" Hopes for the future: \"A happy upbringing, a good education, and the fulfilment of his potential.\"",

The 20-year-old man, who told detectives that he was abducted in the street, was being treated at an undisclosed hospital. His injuries are not thought to be life threatening and Scotland Yard said it did not know of any motive. Boy's organs save lives The organs of 12-year-old James Gregory, who died after being knocked down by a bus in March, have been used to save the lives of four other children. Debbie Gregory, 39, of Plymouth, said her son had filled in a donor card when he was 10. His heart and lungs had been given to a 12-year-old girl with cystic fibrosis, his liver went to a baby and his kidneys to two boys, aged 15 and four. New tests on IRA's Deal bomb Police are to use new forensic techniques on the remains of the 15lb IRA bomb which killed 11 Royal Marine bandsmen in an attack at the Royal Marine school of music in Deal, Kent, in September 1989. No-one was ever prosecuted for planting the bomb, which went off while the band practised and also injured 60 bandsmen. Motorist dies in 500ft cliff fall A man died yesterday after his car went over a 500ft cliff at Countisbury Hill, Lynton, north Devon. Police said someone saw debris about halfway up the cliff. Police are trying to identify the motorist. Three share \u00a35m Three ticketholders each won \u00a31,670,691 in Saturday's \u00a35,012,073 lottery with numbers 7, 11, 18, 21, 25, and 44. The bonus ball was 28. There were no winners of the Thunderball \u00a3250,000 top prize. The numbers were 1, 21, 25, 32 and 33 and the Thunderball 11.",

An article in the respected Art Review, which claims that the National Gallery altered the back of the 17th century painting of Rubens's Samson and Delilah to conceal that it is not the work of the great Flemish artist, has spiced up a row which has simmered for over a decade. If true, it would mean the Old Testament scene - valued at an estimated \u00a340m - was painted by one of his pupils, and its worth could be as little as \u00a31m. The new evidence is presented by Michael Daley, director of ArtWatch UK, a fake-hunter and long-standing critic of the work, in tomorrow's edition of the art journal. Samson and Delilah has hung in the National Gallery since it was bought for \u00a32.5m in 1980, then the second highest price paid for a work of art.

Conservatives on the Guardian Council invalidated 726,000 votes in the capital from the February 18 polls, and apparently rejigged the order of the winners. Former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who was said to be in 30th place after preliminary results were released, was now in 20th place for 30 seats from Tehran. Rasoul Montajabnia, a pro-reform cleric who was in 27th place before being pushed into a run-off by the recent announcement, accused the Guardians of rigging the results to secure places for some of their loyalists. \"The action of the Guardian Council was the worst in 21 years.

However, an important additional point is that incineration of waste encourages the continued manufacture of those products which themselves lead to dioxin formation. For example dioxin formation occurs when PVC is manufactured and again if it is involved in combustion, as in house fires.</p> <p>The organisations most interested in lobbying in favour of waste incineration are the ones that produce the toxic problems. They know better than most that if the disposal route of incineration is closed, the spotlight will inevitably turn to them and pressure will mount for the elimination of their products. This would be a sensible \"front-end\" solution, as there are more environmentally neutral alternatives for almost all organochlorine products. <br><br><b>Dr Vyvyan Howard</b><br> University of Liverpool<br> c.v.howard@liv.ac.uk</p> <p>\u0095 The cancer threat will not have been news to the US government. Both the US and UK governments are major players in the UN convention on persistent organic pollutants which already recognises this group of substances as being among the 12 \"most toxic chemicals known to man\". Dioxins are known hormone disrupting chemicals which can accumulate in the body. Exposure to dioxins and dioxin-like substances has been linked to IQ deficiencies and to effects on co-ordination development in children. They are also implicated in reproductive problems and weakened immune systems in people and wildlife.</p> <p>In light of the EPA report, and the additional threat of cancer, government, industry and retailers should phase out the use of substances which release dioxins when not properly disposed of. The government must also reconsider plans to build more incinerators and instead invest in more environmentally sound methods of waste disposal, ending the gamble being played with public health. <br><br>Chloe Webster<br> Toxics policy officer, WWF-UK <br></p> <p>\u0095 If we are really concerned about incineration, we should be putting pressure on manufacturers not to overpackage goods. Marks and Spencers are selling ladies' panties enclosed in a thick plastic wallet which would be good for at least five years of constant use, but which are destined solely to be dumped in the bin. <br><br>Leslie Wilson<br> Reading</p> <p>\u0095 For years the Cooperative Bank has been drawing attention to the link between dioxins and a range of health problems. Unfortunately, the Advertising Standards Authority, following a complaint from the British Plastics Federation, has ruled we should not use the phrase \"the evidence is frightening\" whilst conducting the debate as this would be \"unduly alarmist\". With the EPA set to announce that people on normal diets have a one in 100 chance of contracting cancer as a result of dioxins contamination of the environment, can we now consider the evidence as frightening? <br><br><b>Paul Monaghan</b> Ecology unit manager Cooperative Bank</p> <p>\u0095 The UK recycles 8% of all household waste, compared to Switzerland's 52%. The UK has 3.5m tonnes of waste paper available for recovery. The disposal cost is \u00a3175m, but it could produce recycled paper products worth in excess of \u00a32.2bn. This is not money that should be allowed to go up in smoke. <br><br>Andy Moore Community Recycling Network</p> <p>\u0095 Archie Norman says \"Labour have failed to stem the growth of waste in this country... the government should bin their white paper...\" Is this joined-up opposition? <br><br>Bob Rotheram Nottingham</p>",

      "bodyText": "Congratulations on your coverage (Incinerator cancer threat revealed, May 18). However, an important additional point is that incineration of waste encourages the continued manufacture of those products which themselves lead to dioxin formation. For example dioxin formation occurs when PVC is manufactured and again if it is involved in combustion, as in house fires. The organisations most interested in lobbying in favour of waste incineration are the ones that produce the toxic problems. They know better than most that if the disposal route of incineration is closed, the spotlight will inevitably turn to them and pressure will mount for the elimination of their products. This would be a sensible \"front-end\" solution, as there are more environmentally neutral alternatives for almost all organochlorine products. Dr Vyvyan Howard University of Liverpool c.v.howard@liv.ac.uk \u0095 The cancer threat will not have been news to the US government. Both the US and UK governments are major players in the UN convention on persistent organic pollutants which already recognises this group of substances as being among the 12 \"most toxic chemicals known to man\". Dioxins are known hormone disrupting chemicals which can accumulate in the body. Exposure to dioxins and dioxin-like substances has been linked to IQ deficiencies and to effects on co-ordination development in children. They are also implicated in reproductive problems and weakened immune systems in people and wildlife. In light of the EPA report, and the additional threat of cancer, government, industry and retailers should phase out the use of substances which release dioxins when not properly disposed of. The government must also reconsider plans to build more incinerators and instead invest in more environmentally sound methods of waste disposal, ending the gamble being played with public health. Chloe Webster Toxics policy officer, WWF-UK \u0095 If we are really concerned about incineration, we should be putting pressure on manufacturers not to overpackage goods. Marks and Spencers are selling ladies' panties enclosed in a thick plastic wallet which would be good for at least five years of constant use, but which are destined solely to be dumped in the bin. Leslie Wilson Reading \u0095 For years the Cooperative Bank has been drawing attention to the link between dioxins and a range of health problems. Unfortunately, the Advertising Standards Authority, following a complaint from the British Plastics Federation, has ruled we should not use the phrase \"the evidence is frightening\" whilst conducting the debate as this would be \"unduly alarmist\". With the EPA set to announce that people on normal diets have a one in 100 chance of contracting cancer as a result of dioxins contamination of the environment, can we now consider the evidence as frightening? Paul Monaghan Ecology unit manager Cooperative Bank \u0095 The UK recycles 8% of all household waste, compared to Switzerland's 52%. The UK has 3.5m tonnes of waste paper available for recovery. The disposal cost is \u00a3175m, but it could produce recycled paper products worth in excess of \u00a32.2bn. This is not money that should be allowed to go up in smoke. Andy Moore Community Recycling Network \u0095 Archie Norman says \"Labour have failed to stem the growth of waste in this country... the government should bin their white paper...\" Is this joined-up opposition?

And what better team to do it than Johnny Vaughan, ex-Loaded ed James Brown, now chief executive of his own publishing company, and Piers Adam, nightclub owner and friend of It girls and rich boys for more than 15 years? All three have been connected in a project (codenamed \"the shed\") which Adam and his business partner Nicholas Green hope will become the ultimate online club or lifestyle portal for guys. Clubs, babe magnets, gangsta movies, football, champers, VIP gold card- what more could a chap want?

At least half the photographers (and the loudest fans) are dressed in 40s outfits, giving a surreal performance-art aspect to the event, while suspended from the facade of the auditorium, people in red Lycra bodysuits are performing a kind of mid-air abseiling dance. Most tellingly, the people filing in, the superstars who are the focus of all the palaver, are not actors or musicians but new media entrepreneurs. They are fit and tanned, and positively reek of money. Suddenly, cliches about geeks and ponytails seem old-fashioned. </p> <p>This is the scene outside last week's 2000 <a href=\"http://www.webbyawards.com\">Webby awards</a> which had a modest start four years ago in a North Beach nightclub, but now looks set to become the index of success in the global new media scene. Since it started in 1997, the Webbies has grown to eclipse its many rivals, most of which have little profile or credibility, even within the online community. A few weeks ago the <a href=\"http://www.coolsiteoftheyear.com/awards.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">Cool Site of the Year</a> awards the longest established web awards ceremony, and a recognised name among old-school netheads, went off without causing so much as a ripple. By contrast, the Webbies is fast becoming an institution. The city's flamboyant mayor, Willie Brown, addressed the audience of 2,500, saying that, thanks to them, \"this city has become the centre of the world,\" a sentiment predictably enough greeted with a huge cheer. </p> <p>However, the Webbies phenomenon is not only the product of the West Coast's talent for self-congratulation. Even the traditional East-West rivalry hasn't prevented the New York Times from telling its readers to \"forget the Oscars, here come the Webbies\", while Entertainment Weekly writes drily that the awards \"have grown in significance as fast as your PC has aged.\" Perhaps the most telling index of the ceremony's success is that given by <a href=\"http://www.sfgirl.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.sfgirl.com</a>, a site which lists the almost indecent number of dot.com schmoozing parties in the Bay area, along with tips on how to crash them. The post-Webbies bash was rated as the hot ticket of the year, especially for those determined party girls in search of a net-millionaire husband. </p> <p>The Webbies' founder, self-described \"digital diva\" Tiffany Shlain, describes the awards' mission as \"objectively honouring excellence.\" To this end she has established the wonderfully pompous sounding International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences, which includes a host of big name judges, such as Simpsons creator Matt Groening on humour, David Bowie on music and Francis Ford Coppola on film. </p> <p>Though the IADAS works with all the seriousness of the Oscar Academy, the Webbies' success can be ascribed less to its exertions - and its sometimes wayward choice of winners - than to Shlain's own drive and larger-than-life personality. Though the ceremony was compered by actor Alan Cumming, and awards were presented by Tina Brown and Sandra Bernhard, no one attending was left in any doubt that they were at Tiffany's show. \"My inspiration this year\" she bubbled in her welcoming speech, \"was HG Wells's The Time Machine\", before outlining her theory of how the net has \"collapsed space and time and seems to allow us to experience everything all at once.\" </p> <p>Her showmanship and eye for catchy presentational techniques have given the Webbies a number of instant \"traditions,\" such as the 40s paparazzi, the ceremony's trademark five-word acceptance speeches, and the \"nominees altar\" in the foyer, a voodoo-esque concoction of vegetables, 8-balls, SF paperbacks and lucky dice that delighted San Francisco traditionalists, and baffled newcomers. </p> <p> The photogenic Shlain acts as a figurehead for the awards, tirelessly promoting them through appearances on TV and in print. As a result her creation is now backed by international media group IDG, whose core business is print publishing, including the popular \"for dummies\" series of technology primers. </p> <p>This year's Webbies appeared to mark a watershed in the convergence of \"old\" and \"new\" media. Produced with a level of glitz hitherto unseen at online gatherings, they are attracting as much attention from the worlds of mainstream music, film, TV and print media as from the dot.com business and hacker communities. Many of the winners straddle both worlds. <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com\">MSNBC</a> the quintessential broadcast-interactive collaboration between Microsoft and the NBC network, won in the TV category, while the travel award went to <a href=\"http://www.outsidemag.com\">www.outsidemag.com</a> the online presence of the popular US print publication. </p> <p>John Battelle, founder of weekly dot.com industry bible <a href=\"http://www.thestandard.com\">The Standard</a> believes that we are moving into an era when the distinctions no longer apply. \"I don't see any difference any more. This year for the first time there are websites doing numbers bigger than broadcast TV ratings. It's all just media now. It's the same business.\" </p> <p>The sharp-eyed gaggle of online marketeers will have noted the Webby recognition of several strong internet-based media brands which started up in the old-fashioned shoe string manner. Webzine <a href=\"http://www.theonion.com\">the Onion</a> won in the humour category, while the news award went to Jim Romanesko's industry gossip site <a href=\"http://www.poynter.org/medianews\">Media News</a> which is fast becoming a must-read for journalists on both sides of the Atlantic. These sites have gained preeminence through word of mouth, building communities of users from the ground up rather than relying on the huge marketing spends with which many venture capital-financed dot.com start-ups try to establish themselves. </p> <p>However far the web has travelled on the road to mainstream media convergence, it still has one foot in traditional online culture, and the rules of the game are different. As a result \"old\" media enterprises such as film and TV are having to place representatives in the Bay area, in order to participate in the networking frenzy and keep up with accelerating technological and cultural trends. </p> <p>Lucian James, a development producer with LA-based TV production company World of Wonder, recently relocated to San Francisco to develop WoW's new media operations. \"Really there is no option. It's ironic. The whole point of the internet is that it's supposed be global. But somehow San Francisco is still ground zero.\" Battelle agrees. \"This world is extraordinarily tied by personal relationships - that's why the geographic region is so important, and why people are prepared to pay $100 per square foot for real estate. They want to be within a stone's throw of everyone else.\" </p> <p>The Webbies are now established as an integral part of this networking scene, focusing attention in a culture where attention is a primary currency, as well as giving something for start-up chief executives to brag about at parties. James believes they serve a useful purpose. \"Winning a Webby is one of the best ways of raising your site out of the white noise of the rest of the internet.\" </p> <p> However, some old-school netheads disagree. Rob \"Commander Taco\" Malda, who set up tech-discussion community <a href=\"http://www.slashdot.org\">Slashdot</a>, which was nominated in two categories, didn't bother leaving Michigan to attend. \"I'm pretty oblivious to stuff outside things that matter to me,\" he emails. \"Web awards really don't. Ya know I've got a couple of trophies sitting on my desk from a few other awards, but they don't really matter. I've also got a folder full of cool email that readers sent me. That matters a lot more then a cheesy piece of plastic.\" </p> <p>Despite such occasional voices of dissent, the consensus of opinion is that the Webbies are here to stay, and that next year's event will be even glitzier than this. At the after-awards party, as trays of sushi circulate and winners are mobbed by people thrusting business cards at them, net celebrity Mahir is surrounded by fans of his <a href=\"http://www.angelfire.com/ma2/mahircagri/index.html\" target=\"_NEW\">I Kiss You</a> site, while the creator of controversial music-sharing software <a href=\"http://www.napster.com\">Napster</a> is being interviewed by a TV crew as the team behind film winners <a href=\"http://www.atomfilms.com\">Atom Films</a> describe their plans for online commissioning and sales to studio executives from LA. </p> <p>At the bar I overhear the editor of <a href=\"http://www.nerve.org\">Nerve</a> which won in the print and zines category, being schmoozed by an attractive woman in a clinging evening gown. \"You must be so proud,\" she purrs, flashing him a smile full of dot.com promise. \"Could I touch it?\" He holds out his award for her to stroke. It's all a long way from geeky kids in bedrooms.</p>",

Before, he had a company called Obsolete and was a music journalist, DJ and graphic designer. </p> <p> <strong> What's the clever idea?</strong> \"Basically on all web servers there is a page you can modify which is the error page. These are very unused as media essentially, but a lot of people see them. So why not give people a bit of a surprise instead of a standard you-haven't-found-what-you're-looking-for message? They'll get a Levi's- branded picture which says things like, Chill Out, You're Looking For Things Too Quickly, that sort of thing. You click on it and it takes you to the microsite we've built <a href=\"http://www.yahoo.se/lateral\">www.yahoo.se/latera</a>. </p> <p> <strong> What's the thinking behind it? </strong> \"For the launch of Levi's Engineered Jeans - a big new product - we wanted to do something completely different and unexpected again. And the whole thing about the jeans is that they have a twist on the leg, so we thought we'd do an online campaign with a twist, which is you never actually see it unless you find an error page. So we bought all the error pages across Europe for <a href=\"http://www.Yahoo.co.uk\" target=\"NEW\">Yahoo!</a> - every time anybody gets an error, they get a little Levi's message.\" </p> <p> <strong> How does it work?</strong> \"It's really simple. You've gone to Yahoo, don't find what you're looking for and it comes up with an error page. On the page, at least two-thirds of the screen is covered with a Levi's picture which, when clicked, takes you through to a \"microsite\" which pops up windows that allow you to navigate and find out about the products. It's a mad, bizarre website that gives users information about Levi's Engineered Jeans and a very cool online experience. It makes people think about Levis and we achieved our targets quicker than expected.\" </p> <p> <strong> Possible shortcomings?</strong> \"I'd have liked to have seen it go on more sites, but Yahoo were the only people who had pan-European spread, so we could get into all the countries we wanted. Also, people might not necessarily go through the whole experience, but that's fine because all we really want is for them to get a bit of a quick hit.\" </p> <p> <strong> What's next?</strong> \"Immediately afterwards we did the Stellas [online movie ratings]. We were trying to come up with some way to get Stella's association with film across the internet. We negotiated a deal which basically took the voting from the Guardian, Empire, Popcorn and other sites and aggregated them into one web rating system - the Stellas - so you have the actual review and also the Stella rating. Useful and a clever use of media and hopefully next year we'll do an awards ceremony. We've also just launched the website for Honest, Dave Stewart's film, and are about to launch the site for Nick Park's Chicken Run.\" </p>",

You click on it and it takes you to the microsite we've built www.yahoo.se/latera. What's the thinking behind it? \"For the launch of Levi's Engineered Jeans - a big new product - we wanted to do something completely different and unexpected again. And the whole thing about the jeans is that they have a twist on the leg, so we thought we'd do an online campaign with a twist, which is you never actually see it unless you find an error page. So we bought all the error pages across Europe for Yahoo! - every time anybody gets an error, they get a little Levi's message.\" How does it work? \"It's really simple. You've gone to Yahoo, don't find what you're looking for and it comes up with an error page. On the page, at least two-thirds of the screen is covered with a Levi's picture which, when clicked, takes you through to a \"microsite\" which pops up windows that allow you to navigate and find out about the products. It's a mad, bizarre website that gives users information about Levi's Engineered Jeans and a very cool online experience. It makes people think about Levis and we achieved our targets quicker than expected.\" Possible shortcomings? \"I'd have liked to have seen it go on more sites, but Yahoo were the only people who had pan-European spread, so we could get into all the countries we wanted. Also, people might not necessarily go through the whole experience, but that's fine because all we really want is for them to get a bit of a quick hit.\" What's next? \"Immediately afterwards we did the Stellas [online movie ratings]. We were trying to come up with some way to get Stella's association with film across the internet. We negotiated a deal which basically took the voting from the Guardian, Empire, Popcorn and other sites and aggregated them into one web rating system - the Stellas - so you have the actual review and also the Stella rating. Useful and a clever use of media and hopefully next year we'll do an awards ceremony. We've also just launched the website for Honest, Dave Stewart's film, and are about to launch the site for Nick Park's Chicken Run.\"",

It is precisely this banking background, Abell believes, that has given her the edge in a job where a high level of numeracy is essential. </p> <p>She never planned to work on a farm. \"I've always loved riding and wherever I've lived I've usually helped people out with their horses.

It makes more sense for me to spend a lot of time on the accounts because I'm cheaper to pay than the accountants. I actually received a letter from our accountants that said that I was saving the farm a lot of money because I presented everything so clearly.\" One of the farms is on the coast and also operates as a bed and breakfast business. \"I really enjoy going there. I'm given a lovely meal and we have quite a chat. It's very sociable!\" </p> <p>Nevertheless, being a farm secretary can be quite isolating. \"Some secretaries are just given a pile of work and are left to get on with it. I don't mind that, but it is quite nice to have someone else around every now and then. Every Friday I go to a farm where the farmer usually works in the office with me - he likes to keep an overview of the administration. That's an extremely busy job because in addition to looking after his farm he is also the master of the local hunt and there's a huge amount of paperwork involved with fox-hunting.
