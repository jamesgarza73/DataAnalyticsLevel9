Royle praised Kennedy as his side's \"match-winner\" and added: \"It's a confidence thing with him, and in the last two games he has looked to be back to his best. \"We started like a house on fire. But their equaliser rocked us, and they made it very difficult with bodies behind the ball. But Kennedy changed all that. He's capable of getting 15 goals a season, and I hope that will encourage him.\" Norwich's manager Bruce Rioch must have had mixed feelings at seeing someone he had signed as a 16-year-old when he was at Millwall deny his side a point. \"We deserved to get something out of the game,\" Rioch said and then, referring to Kennedy, added: \"We go back a long way, and I know he has a lot more to offer. He has a great talent, a great left foot; he can cross and shoot. But he has got to keep driving himself forward.\"",

      "body": "<p>Cameroon became the champions of Africa for the third time yesterday with a dramatic penalty shoot-out victory over the hosts Nigeria. </p> <p>The 4-3 win, after the match had finished 2-2 following extra-time, was steeped in controversy after Victor Ikpeba's fourth penalty for Nigeria was not awarded by the Tunisian referee Mourad Daami despite appearing to cross the line after hitting the underside of the crossbar. </p> <p>Arsenal's Nwankwo Kanu had earlier seen his penalty, Nigeria's third, saved by Boukar Alioum. </p> <p>After Marc-Vivien Fo\u00e9 of West Ham had spurned the first chance to win the game for Cameroon, placing his penalty wide of the post, Liverpool's Rigobert Song held his nerve to seal victory. </p> <p>Nigeria had recovered from two goals down to force the game into extra-time. Samuel Oto'o silenced the 40,000 fans at the Surulere Stadium with a superbly taken goal in the 27th minute. The Real Madrid teenager controlled a quick free-kick before turning past Furo Iyenemi and firing a shot into the far corner. </p> <p>Cameroon quickly doubled the lead when Nigeria's goalkeeper Ike Sharunmu let a shot from Patrick Mboma squirm through his legs. </p> <p>Twice Cameroon spurned chances to put the result beyond doubt. Oto'o hit a shot at the legs of a defender after Sharunmu stumbled outside his penalty area, before Mboma's 41st-minute header struck a post. </p> <p>The hosts scored a desperately needed goal just before half-time when Chukwu Ndukwe made the most of poor Cameroon marking to finish from close range. Then Jay-Jay Okocha marked his return to the team after a one-match suspension with a stunning 25-yard shot to make it 2-2 within 90 seconds of the restart. </p> <p>Cameroon had beaten Nigeria in the African Nations Cup finals of 1984 and 1988 but they squandered several more chances to seal a comfortable victory this time, with Eto'o especially unlucky to see a 51st-minute shot bounce back off the post. </p> <p>\"All credit to the players because they could have easily lost faith after Nigeria made it 2-2,\" said Cameroon's coach Pierre Lechantre. \"But they came out fighting and showed how determined they were to win this cup.\" </p> <p>Nigeria, unbeaten at home for 19 years and defending an 11-match unbeaten run in the tournament, took the game to Cameroon in extra-time, Babangida and Ikpeba both coming close to scoring as penalties loomed.

      "bodyText": "Cameroon became the champions of Africa for the third time yesterday with a dramatic penalty shoot-out victory over the hosts Nigeria. The 4-3 win, after the match had finished 2-2 following extra-time, was steeped in controversy after Victor Ikpeba's fourth penalty for Nigeria was not awarded by the Tunisian referee Mourad Daami despite appearing to cross the line after hitting the underside of the crossbar. Arsenal's Nwankwo Kanu had earlier seen his penalty, Nigeria's third, saved by Boukar Alioum. After Marc-Vivien Fo\u00e9 of West Ham had spurned the first chance to win the game for Cameroon, placing his penalty wide of the post, Liverpool's Rigobert Song held his nerve to seal victory. Nigeria had recovered from two goals down to force the game into extra-time. Samuel Oto'o silenced the 40,000 fans at the Surulere Stadium with a superbly taken goal in the 27th minute. The Real Madrid teenager controlled a quick free-kick before turning past Furo Iyenemi and firing a shot into the far corner. Cameroon quickly doubled the lead when Nigeria's goalkeeper Ike Sharunmu let a shot from Patrick Mboma squirm through his legs. Twice Cameroon spurned chances to put the result beyond doubt. Oto'o hit a shot at the legs of a defender after Sharunmu stumbled outside his penalty area, before Mboma's 41st-minute header struck a post. The hosts scored a desperately needed goal just before half-time when Chukwu Ndukwe made the most of poor Cameroon marking to finish from close range. Then Jay-Jay Okocha marked his return to the team after a one-match suspension with a stunning 25-yard shot to make it 2-2 within 90 seconds of the restart. Cameroon had beaten Nigeria in the African Nations Cup finals of 1984 and 1988 but they squandered several more chances to seal a comfortable victory this time, with Eto'o especially unlucky to see a 51st-minute shot bounce back off the post. \"All credit to the players because they could have easily lost faith after Nigeria made it 2-2,\" said Cameroon's coach Pierre Lechantre. \"But they came out fighting and showed how determined they were to win this cup.\" Nigeria, unbeaten at home for 19 years and defending an 11-match unbeaten run in the tournament, took the game to Cameroon in extra-time, Babangida and Ikpeba both coming close to scoring as penalties loomed. But they could not put an end to Cameroon's jinx over Nigeria. Meanwhile South Africa's Mark Fish announced his retirement from international football after South Africa's 2-1 victory over Tunisia in the third-place play-off, citing distaste for the South African federation as the reason for his decision. The Bolton defender, who has 58 caps, said he was unhappy with the treatment of the coaching staff and the way football is run in South Africa. Nigeria (4-4-2): Shorunmu; Okpara, Iyenemi, West, Babayaro; Oliseh, Adepoju (Ikpeba, 96min), Okocha, George (Babangida, 70); Kanu, Chukwu (Aghahowa, h-t). Cameroon (3-5-2): Alioum; Song, Kalla (Mettomo, 93), Njanka; Fo\u00e9, Wome, Njitap, Mayer, Olembe; Mboma, Eto'o (Job, 72). Referee: M Daami (Tunisia).",

Kenny Dalglish hardly looked like a man who had spent a few sleepless nights, his Celtic footballers looked as if they could play the game and their travelling supporters clearly were not the same people who had been trying to turn scarf throwing into an Olympic event. At Dens Park, there were actually smiles on faces. </p> <p>Nor did the ghost of John Barnes hover over the match, the \"head coach\" being last seen with a burger and fries outside his house before leaving for Liverpool to resume private life. It was rather as if the past seven months simply had not happened.</p> <p>Indeed, the atmosphere was improved enough for Dalglish to wax almost lyrical. Of course, three goals poured on old wounds is strong medicine.</p> <p>But there were still things that jarred on a bitter day. Mark Viduka and Ian Wright made a big play of kissing their shirt badge, which was rather overdoing it. They are paid for their services and are not required to fall in love with the hand that signs the cheques. But at least everyone wanted to talk rather than sulk.</p> <p>The Australian, whose dressing-room antics at half-time on Tuesday against Inverness Caledonian Thistle represented the first bit of the roof falling in, was positively chirpy. \"My conscience is clear. Nobody got hit, as has been suggested. It was just an argument, nothing more. They happen in every dressing room and I think that the most disappointing thing is that it leaked out.\"</p> <p>Dalglish significantly threw an olive branch to his fans by relegating the Israeli Eyal Berkovic to the bench. This was surely a signal that the caretaker manager believes, like themselves, that a player's shorts should get dirty while playing in a Scottish winter. </p> <p>Olivier Tebily also started on the bench but came on to play surprisingly well as a wide midfielder. \"I thought we had another Jimmy Johnstone out there,\" said Dalglish with only the slightest touch of irony. Jonathan Gould was left out, presumably as a scapegoat. </p> <p>The Monday-morning question, though, is whether the director of football wants to stay in the dug-out. He keeps insisting he does not but softened his stance slightly on Saturday evening. \"At the moment it feels good,\" he said, \"but right now I don't think it will be me who is the next manager.\" Tommy Burns remains favourite. </p> <p>Wednesday's CIS Insurance Cup semi-final against Kilmarnock will tell us more about the club's state of health. </p> <p>Against a useful Dundee, every single player felt he had to tear into every tackle by way of atonement. That eventually set up three second-half goals for Johan Mjallby, Viduka and Colin Healy, but the sight of Alan Stubbs playing in midfield was a reminder of how slender Celtic's resources are with Paul Lambert out.</p> <p>But that hardly mattered to the fans, who saw Rangers' lead cut to seven points. Within days they will have branded Dalglish as some kind of miracle worker and the soap opera - nobody say crisis - will go on its merry way.</p> <p>\u0095 The Celtic-slayers of Inverness were brought down to earth at Love Street where St Mirren extended their lead at the top of the First Division with a 2-0 win. Caley enjoyed the grateful support of a coachload of Rangers fans, whose team were not playing on Saturday.</p>",

Nor did the ghost of John Barnes hover over the match, the \"head coach\" being last seen with a burger and fries outside his house before leaving for Liverpool to resume private life. It was rather as if the past seven months simply had not happened. Indeed, the atmosphere was improved enough for Dalglish to wax almost lyrical. Of course, three goals poured on old wounds is strong medicine. But there were still things that jarred on a bitter day. Mark Viduka and Ian Wright made a big play of kissing their shirt badge, which was rather overdoing it. They are paid for their services and are not required to fall in love with the hand that signs the cheques. But at least everyone wanted to talk rather than sulk. The Australian, whose dressing-room antics at half-time on Tuesday against Inverness Caledonian Thistle represented the first bit of the roof falling in, was positively chirpy. \"My conscience is clear. Nobody got hit, as has been suggested. It was just an argument, nothing more. They happen in every dressing room and I think that the most disappointing thing is that it leaked out.\" Dalglish significantly threw an olive branch to his fans by relegating the Israeli Eyal Berkovic to the bench. This was surely a signal that the caretaker manager believes, like themselves, that a player's shorts should get dirty while playing in a Scottish winter. Olivier Tebily also started on the bench but came on to play surprisingly well as a wide midfielder. \"I thought we had another Jimmy Johnstone out there,\" said Dalglish with only the slightest touch of irony. Jonathan Gould was left out, presumably as a scapegoat. The Monday-morning question, though, is whether the director of football wants to stay in the dug-out. He keeps insisting he does not but softened his stance slightly on Saturday evening. \"At the moment it feels good,\" he said, \"but right now I don't think it will be me who is the next manager.\" Tommy Burns remains favourite. Wednesday's CIS Insurance Cup semi-final against Kilmarnock will tell us more about the club's state of health. Against a useful Dundee, every single player felt he had to tear into every tackle by way of atonement. That eventually set up three second-half goals for Johan Mjallby, Viduka and Colin Healy, but the sight of Alan Stubbs playing in midfield was a reminder of how slender Celtic's resources are with Paul Lambert out. But that hardly mattered to the fans, who saw Rangers' lead cut to seven points. Within days they will have branded Dalglish as some kind of miracle worker and the soap opera - nobody say crisis - will go on its merry way. \u0095 The Celtic-slayers of Inverness were brought down to earth at Love Street where St Mirren extended their lead at the top of the First Division with a 2-0 win. Caley enjoyed the grateful support of a coachload of Rangers fans, whose team were not playing on Saturday.",

      "bodyText": "Whether Igor Stimac believes MI5 killed Princess Diana is unclear but he certainly sees a conspiracy against Paolo di Canio. When push comes to shove, the defender said, West Ham are paying for the Paul Alcock affair 17 months on. Twice Di Canio was fouled in the box, Stimac claimed, and twice Neal Barry played on. There could be only one explanation. \"This referee wanted Bradford to win the game,\" the Croatian said. \"His decisions were amazing. \"I think they are trying to punish Paolo di Canio for what he did more than a year ago. He's been punished by the FA, so referees should stop doing that. He had two clear penalties... What's the point of the rules? What's the point of referees?\" The defender's words amount to an accusation of professional misconduct, which might interest Lancaster Gate. At least Di Canio did not give the crowd a chance to see whether the soles of Barry's boots are sponsored. To suggest he was angry is an understatement. Inside half an hour the Italian felt he should have had two penalties, although the first looked a dive. Stimac said: \"At half-time he was very disturbed.

But after 11 months out of the Premiership, four since his last loan match with Fulham and weeks of false rumours and headlines he was back where he wanted to be. </p> <p>O'Neill, expected to give him a late run, started him instead. At first he bumbled his control. Then he shot with absurd speculation, wanting too much too soon. But, as he picked up the pace, he became increasingly integrated in a three-man front line. \"When we thought he might be getting tired, he got stronger,\" said O'Neill. Collymore was ever perverse. In truth he had not done enough to get tired. That was part of the problem at Aston Villa; he seldom did. </p> <p>O'Neill, running with his psychological wheeze, kept him on to the end. He said beforehand: \"Anything he does on the field is a bonus\", as if he had signed him primarily for dressing-room harmony. </p> <p>There was no sign of bonus until the last half-hour when two headers showed Collymore's talent and avowed hunger. Chris Day tipped the second away. For the first Collymore outjumped him and saw his soaring header come back off the bar. Far from cursing his luck he was up for the sequel, the natural reaction of one for whom team matters more than self. </p> <p>Endorsing the impression of a changed man, he admitted to being nervous. \"It's hard to describe what it's like to be back. It's like a dream.\" And until late on he played like a sleep-walker unaware of his stage. He thanked Leicester for making \"him feel really welcome\". The wages of thanks is effort. </p> <p>Collymore, the gifted charmer who can strike with either foot and both personalities, continues to court goodwill before losing it. Graham Taylor, generous, civilising and so much an admirer that he owned up to having nearly picked him for England as a Southend player, popped in to wish him well. But for the time being Collymore remains a conundrum wrapped in contradiction and stuffed with scrambled ego. </p> <p>Oh yes, the match. Nordin Wooter's deflected header matched Matt Elliott's cock-eyed opener. Was this the top level Collymore craved? Not for long in Watford's case, it appears. Or was it just a dream, the same old dream, soon to be fouled up once more?</p>",

In truth he had not done enough to get tired. That was part of the problem at Aston Villa; he seldom did. O'Neill, running with his psychological wheeze, kept him on to the end. He said beforehand: \"Anything he does on the field is a bonus\", as if he had signed him primarily for dressing-room harmony. There was no sign of bonus until the last half-hour when two headers showed Collymore's talent and avowed hunger. Chris Day tipped the second away. For the first Collymore outjumped him and saw his soaring header come back off the bar. Far from cursing his luck he was up for the sequel, the natural reaction of one for whom team matters more than self. Endorsing the impression of a changed man, he admitted to being nervous. \"It's hard to describe what it's like to be back. It's like a dream.\" And until late on he played like a sleep-walker unaware of his stage. He thanked Leicester for making \"him feel really welcome\". The wages of thanks is effort. Collymore, the gifted charmer who can strike with either foot and both personalities, continues to court goodwill before losing it. Graham Taylor, generous, civilising and so much an admirer that he owned up to having nearly picked him for England as a Southend player, popped in to wish him well. But for the time being Collymore remains a conundrum wrapped in contradiction and stuffed with scrambled ego. Oh yes, the match. Nordin Wooter's deflected header matched Matt Elliott's cock-eyed opener. Was this the top level Collymore craved? Not for long in Watford's case, it appears. Or was it just a dream, the same old dream, soon to be fouled up once more?",

      "body": "<p>A little over 10 years ago on 20th August 1989 on a fine warm summer evening, 132 people were enjoying a riverboat party on the Thames.</p> <p>Within minutes their boat - the Marchioness - would be sunk, struck by a dredger, the Bowbelle. 51 young people would lose their lives and many more would be injured.</p> <p>Many questions have remained unanswered about the cause of the collision, the reason why so many died, and the handling of the whole affair following the incident.</p> <p>The search for the truth was not helped by the failure of the then Government to institute a full public inquiry.</p> <p>On 18th August last year, I announced a wide-ranging Public Inquiry into safety on the River Thames and the circumstances surrounding the Marchioness disaster.</p> <p>It was chaired by a senior judge, Lord Justice Clarke.</p> <p>It was an open public inquiry. Its scope was broad and its examination detailed, including written and oral evidence.</p> <p>For the first time all the relevant documentation was gathered together in one place and it allowed everyone concerned to make their case.</p> <p>The inquiry reviewed current safety standards on the river and Lord Justice Clarke's report was published quickly, as requested on 2 December 1999.</p> <p>Lord Justice Clarke was also asked to advise \"Whether there is a case for a further investigation or inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the Marchioness disaster and its causes.\"</p> <p>His second report, dealing with this issue, is being published today. Copies of both reports are in the library of the House.</p> <p>I am greatly indebted to Lord Justice Clarke and his team for producing such thorough, well-considered and impressive reports so quickly.</p> <p>Lord Justice Clarke recognises that the regulation of safety on the Thames is much improved since 1989.</p> <p>This is due, in no small part, to the effort of the survivors of the Marchioness tragedy and the relatives of those who died.</p> <p>The Government accepts all 44 of Lord Justice Clarke's recommendations. Ten have already been implemented on the Thames, and action is well advanced on implementing the rest.</p> <p>I have today placed in the Libraries of both Houses an action plan on river safety. This explains how my Department, working with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and the Port of London Authority, intends to implement the recommendations.</p> <p>These include: \u0095 a consultation on the consumption of alcohol by people in charge of vessels; \u0095 funding a Formal Safety Assessment on \"Search and Rescue\" facilities on the Thames; and \u0095 funding the provision of experimental life saving equipment at locations along the Thames.</p> <p>Although the inquiry's recommendations are confined to the Thames, our approach will be to pursue the recommendations on an UK-wide basis.</p> <p>Safety is as important on other rivers as it is on the Thames.</p> <p>Turning to Lord Justice Clarke's second report, he considers the case for a further investigation or inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the Marchioness disaster and its causes. Lord Justice Clarke concludes, and I quote, \"I have no doubt in my mind that if such a tragedy happened today, there would be a widespread public demand for an inquiry. In my opinion such a demand would be entirely justified.\"</p> <p>He goes on to say that the tragedy, \"cried out for public scrutiny in order to discover how it was that such a terrible event could occur.\"</p> <p>To put matters right, I can announce today that I have ordered a Judicial Inquiry under section 268 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 into the collision between the Marchioness and the Bowbelle and the search and rescue operation that followed the collision.</p> <p>My Right Honourable and Noble Friend, the Lord Chancellor, has agreed to appoint Lord Justice Clarke to conduct the Inquiry which will have the power to obtain documents, to issue summons for the attendance of witnesses, to take evidence on oath and to order cross-examination.</p> <p>Lord Justice Clarke considers that the scope of this Inquiry will be sufficient and that the public interest does not require a further inquiry into the Police investigation, the two inquests or the failure to secure criminal convictions.</p> <p>The Government accepts his recommendations on these matters.</p> <p>I commend Members of the House to read Lord Justice Clarke's searching and thorough review.</p> <p>Lord Justice Clarke also addressed the question of the relationship between inquiries, inquests and criminal and civil proceedings.</p> <p>This can be a cause of great frustration and is an issue which concerns me greatly.</p> <p>This can sometimes lead to delays in inquiries, or in the publication of reports. These problems can extend far beyond transport.</p> <p>We therefore need to consider his proposals carefully, across Government. The Government will report to Parliament when we are in a position to do so. However, on one issue, I intend to go beyond what Lord Justice Clarke recommends.</p> <p>The bereaved families have expressed forcefully their great distress at the removal of the hands from the victims for fingerprint identification purposes, without advising the next of kin.</p> <p>Lord Justice Clarke looked at this in detail but did not recommend that this be covered by the Inquiry.</p> <p>However, in consideration of the anguish this incident caused I have set up a non-statutory public inquiry into this specific matter under Lord Justice Clarke to run side by side with the Judicial Inquiry.</p> <p>The full terms of reference will be published today and have been placed in the library.</p> <p>On the matter of the costs, I will look favourably on applications made by the relatives of the victims and the survivors for reasonable legal costs to be met from public funds.</p> <p>Such funds need to be used efficiently so that work is not duplicated and that the Inquiry's timetable is adhered to. Lord Justice Clarke will ultimately decide on the award of costs at the Inquiry.</p> <p>The Marchioness disaster was the last and worst of a series of collisions on the Thames.</p> <p>It raised concerns about boat design, numbers of crew, the readiness of emergency services and the way people were treated after an incident.</p> <p>The Marchioness families, and many others over the last 10 years have made representations to this Government and the last Government. They have felt strongly that no full public inquiry took place and they had limited opportunity to express their concerns.</p> <p>In 1992, I myself condemned the \"legal fancy dancing\" which caused confusion and stood in the way of a full public inquiry.</p> <p>The Marchioness families have lived with grief for 10 years.</p> <p>A new public inquiry cannot bring their loved ones back. But it can, I hope, bring some peace of mind to know that their case can be told and lessons can be learned for the future.</p> <p>Our main purpose is to look to future safety on our rivers.</p> <p>There must never be a repeat of those events of 20 August 1989.</p> <p>I am sure that the whole House will join me in welcoming Lord Justice Clarke's report and looking forward to this new inquiry, which can at last draw a line under an incident which shook the nation at the time and left a legacy of misery and grief which the Marchioness families have lived with ever since.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A little over 10 years ago on 20th August 1989 on a fine warm summer evening, 132 people were enjoying a riverboat party on the Thames. Within minutes their boat - the Marchioness - would be sunk, struck by a dredger, the Bowbelle. 51 young people would lose their lives and many more would be injured. Many questions have remained unanswered about the cause of the collision, the reason why so many died, and the handling of the whole affair following the incident. The search for the truth was not helped by the failure of the then Government to institute a full public inquiry. On 18th August last year, I announced a wide-ranging Public Inquiry into safety on the River Thames and the circumstances surrounding the Marchioness disaster. It was chaired by a senior judge, Lord Justice Clarke. It was an open public inquiry. Its scope was broad and its examination detailed, including written and oral evidence. For the first time all the relevant documentation was gathered together in one place and it allowed everyone concerned to make their case. The inquiry reviewed current safety standards on the river and Lord Justice Clarke's report was published quickly, as requested on 2 December 1999. Lord Justice Clarke was also asked to advise \"Whether there is a case for a further investigation or inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the Marchioness disaster and its causes.\" His second report, dealing with this issue, is being published today. Copies of both reports are in the library of the House. I am greatly indebted to Lord Justice Clarke and his team for producing such thorough, well-considered and impressive reports so quickly. Lord Justice Clarke recognises that the regulation of safety on the Thames is much improved since 1989. This is due, in no small part, to the effort of the survivors of the Marchioness tragedy and the relatives of those who died. The Government accepts all 44 of Lord Justice Clarke's recommendations. Ten have already been implemented on the Thames, and action is well advanced on implementing the rest. I have today placed in the Libraries of both Houses an action plan on river safety. This explains how my Department, working with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and the Port of London Authority, intends to implement the recommendations. These include: \u0095 a consultation on the consumption of alcohol by people in charge of vessels; \u0095 funding a Formal Safety Assessment on \"Search and Rescue\" facilities on the Thames; and \u0095 funding the provision of experimental life saving equipment at locations along the Thames. Although the inquiry's recommendations are confined to the Thames, our approach will be to pursue the recommendations on an UK-wide basis. Safety is as important on other rivers as it is on the Thames. Turning to Lord Justice Clarke's second report, he considers the case for a further investigation or inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the Marchioness disaster and its causes. Lord Justice Clarke concludes, and I quote, \"I have no doubt in my mind that if such a tragedy happened today, there would be a widespread public demand for an inquiry. In my opinion such a demand would be entirely justified.\" He goes on to say that the tragedy, \"cried out for public scrutiny in order to discover how it was that such a terrible event could occur.\" To put matters right, I can announce today that I have ordered a Judicial Inquiry under section 268 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 into the collision between the Marchioness and the Bowbelle and the search and rescue operation that followed the collision. My Right Honourable and Noble Friend, the Lord Chancellor, has agreed to appoint Lord Justice Clarke to conduct the Inquiry which will have the power to obtain documents, to issue summons for the attendance of witnesses, to take evidence on oath and to order cross-examination. Lord Justice Clarke considers that the scope of this Inquiry will be sufficient and that the public interest does not require a further inquiry into the Police investigation, the two inquests or the failure to secure criminal convictions. The Government accepts his recommendations on these matters. I commend Members of the House to read Lord Justice Clarke's searching and thorough review. Lord Justice Clarke also addressed the question of the relationship between inquiries, inquests and criminal and civil proceedings. This can be a cause of great frustration and is an issue which concerns me greatly. This can sometimes lead to delays in inquiries, or in the publication of reports. These problems can extend far beyond transport. We therefore need to consider his proposals carefully, across Government. The Government will report to Parliament when we are in a position to do so. However, on one issue, I intend to go beyond what Lord Justice Clarke recommends. The bereaved families have expressed forcefully their great distress at the removal of the hands from the victims for fingerprint identification purposes, without advising the next of kin. Lord Justice Clarke looked at this in detail but did not recommend that this be covered by the Inquiry. However, in consideration of the anguish this incident caused I have set up a non-statutory public inquiry into this specific matter under Lord Justice Clarke to run side by side with the Judicial Inquiry. The full terms of reference will be published today and have been placed in the library. On the matter of the costs, I will look favourably on applications made by the relatives of the victims and the survivors for reasonable legal costs to be met from public funds. Such funds need to be used efficiently so that work is not duplicated and that the Inquiry's timetable is adhered to. Lord Justice Clarke will ultimately decide on the award of costs at the Inquiry. The Marchioness disaster was the last and worst of a series of collisions on the Thames. It raised concerns about boat design, numbers of crew, the readiness of emergency services and the way people were treated after an incident. The Marchioness families, and many others over the last 10 years have made representations to this Government and the last Government. They have felt strongly that no full public inquiry took place and they had limited opportunity to express their concerns. In 1992, I myself condemned the \"legal fancy dancing\" which caused confusion and stood in the way of a full public inquiry. The Marchioness families have lived with grief for 10 years. A new public inquiry cannot bring their loved ones back. But it can, I hope, bring some peace of mind to know that their case can be told and lessons can be learned for the future. Our main purpose is to look to future safety on our rivers. There must never be a repeat of those events of 20 August 1989. I am sure that the whole House will join me in welcoming Lord Justice Clarke's report and looking forward to this new inquiry, which can at last draw a line under an incident which shook the nation at the time and left a legacy of misery and grief which the Marchioness families have lived with ever since.",

      "body": "<p><strong> 10 reasons why you won't become an internet millionaire . . .</strong> </p> <p> Admit it. You've got a great idea for an internet business. You're fed up of reading, and possibly writing, about other journalists becoming millionaires and you just know that it's your turn now. Well, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but there's a pretty good chance that it's not going to happen. Why? Well, here are 10 reasons for a start . . . </p> <p> <strong> 1. Someone else has already had the idea</strong> </p> <p> A great stumbling block for journalists, who are often so wrapped up in their world that they fail to notice what's going on around them. I haven't yet had someone say: \"Here's a great idea. Let's sell books over the internet\", but I've had plenty of similar ones. The simple rule is if you've had the idea, then at least five other people have as well. If someone else is already doing it, then at least 10 other people are planning to do the same. And, if you find yourself saying \"Yes, they've done it, but we're going to do it better\" then stop immediately. Best is not as important as biggest or first. </p> <p> <strong> 2.

You're fed up of reading, and possibly writing, about other journalists becoming millionaires and you just know that it's your turn now. Well, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but there's a pretty good chance that it's not going to happen. Why? Well, here are 10 reasons for a start . . . 1. Someone else has already had the idea A great stumbling block for journalists, who are often so wrapped up in their world that they fail to notice what's going on around them. I haven't yet had someone say: \"Here's a great idea. Let's sell books over the internet\", but I've had plenty of similar ones. The simple rule is if you've had the idea, then at least five other people have as well. If someone else is already doing it, then at least 10 other people are planning to do the same. And, if you find yourself saying \"Yes, they've done it, but we're going to do it better\" then stop immediately. Best is not as important as biggest or first. 2. You haven't got a domain name The system for registering domain names is rather silly and frustrating, but it's the only one there is.

      "body": "<p>As the one-day series began, we laid out 10 commandments for England - 10 goals they could reasonably hope to achieve. Did they achieve them all? Of course not. This is England we're talking about. Even realistic targets are sometimes out of reach. But they didn't do too badly either. Here's the full balance sheet:</p> <p><strong>1. Reach the final</strong></p> <p>They did it. With a little help from the rain. And the run-rate. But there was rough justice in that, because it was on run-rate that Zimbabwe squeezed England out of the World Cup. \"England's last one-day outing in South Africa,\" we pointed out, \"was a 6-1 drubbing. So mere respectability would be a major advance. It's too much to ask that they beat South Africa, who are the world's most effective one-day team outside of major tournaments.\" And so it proved. What we hadn't bargained for was that South Africa would be a shadow of their normal selves, with no Cullinan, no Donald, no Kirsten, and - for once - no sense of a settled side. They did all they could to lose the tournament, and still ended up winning it comfortably, because England, though only awful on one occasion, were often ordinary. Still, second place is second place, and at least they competed.</p> <p><strong>Result:</strong> a qualified <strong>YES</strong></p> <p><strong>2. Bed in a new opening pair</strong></p> <p>Nasser Hussain and Nick Knight had never opened together in a major match, because Hussain became an opener only when - in a dreadful, panicky piece of selection - Knight was dropped on the eve of the World Cup. \"They have all the balance you could ask for,\" we argued - \"left- and right-hander, blaster and barnacle. But does Hussain have any runs left in him at the end of a long tour, and will he manage to refrain from running Knight out?\" The answers to those questions were \"yes\" and \"yes, just\". The new opening pair were England's best batsmen. In fact most days they were our only batsmen. And they should never have been opening in the final. That was a pitch on which any team was going to lose early wickets. South Africa had taken the precaution of bringing a middle order with them. England hadn't. Knight should have opened with a pinch-hitter, White or Ealham or Read, in the hope of at least dispersing the slips and getting the target down below 120. Hussain should have held himself back to No 5 or 6 to play a captain's innings like Cronje.</p> <p><strong>Result:</strong> another <strong>YES</strong> with reservations</p> <p><strong>3. Field as well as\u00c9</strong></p> <p>\"I was going to say the South Africans, but some observers, amazingly, felt that England had the edge in this department as the Test series went on.\" And they kept it up, on the whole, in the one-dayers, rising to the occasion in the final with a series of scintillating catches. This has been the best thing about the Duncan Fletcher regime.</p> <p><strong>Result:</strong> a triumphant <strong>YES</strong></p> <p><strong>4. Get runs out of Chris Read</strong></p> <p>\"He should get the run in the side that he has been denied at Test level,\" we said. \"And Duncan Fletcher has got to find a way of squeezing some runs out of him \u00c9 Needs to improvise like his glove-mentors, Alan Knott and Jack Russell, and be good for a bustling 20.\" He did it once, in style, reducing Shaun Pollock to stunned silence with a glorious six in the penultimate over at Cape Town. And he did get a settled place in the side, once the horrible idea of giving the gloves to Mark Alleyne had been shelved. But his batting was all icing and no cake. In the final, admittedly when all was lost, he stayed in for longer than anyone else (70 minutes) but made only nine runs, and farmed the strike so ineffectually that Alan Mullally faced more balls than he did, in less time. In Zimbabwe, Read must add the string to his bow that most keepers can offer with their eyes shut: the nudge and nurdle that keeps the scoreboard ticking.</p> <p><strong>Result:</strong> Half a <strong>YES</strong></p> <p><strong>5. Set attacking fields</strong></p> <p>\"The one disappointment of Nasser Hussain's captaincy in the Tests was a tendency to go on the defensive,\" quoth we. \"When in Rome, behave in a way the Roman isn't used to. Keep a slip in throughout a one-day innings \u00c9\" Hmmmm. If Nasser had done that in the final, England might have won. In Sunday's Wisden Verdict, Simon Briggs rightly said that Nasser's decision to take Gough off was fatal. But even when he came back on, he didn't have a slip. Cronje, at times, posted three slips for Pollock, and he is not one of nature's buccaneers.</p> <p><strong>Result:</strong> a disappointing <strong>NO</strong></p> <p><strong>6.

      "bodyText": "As the one-day series began, we laid out 10 commandments for England - 10 goals they could reasonably hope to achieve. Did they achieve them all? Of course not. This is England we're talking about. Even realistic targets are sometimes out of reach. But they didn't do too badly either. Here's the full balance sheet: 1. Reach the final They did it. With a little help from the rain. And the run-rate. But there was rough justice in that, because it was on run-rate that Zimbabwe squeezed England out of the World Cup. \"England's last one-day outing in South Africa,\" we pointed out, \"was a 6-1 drubbing. So mere respectability would be a major advance. It's too much to ask that they beat South Africa, who are the world's most effective one-day team outside of major tournaments.\" And so it proved. What we hadn't bargained for was that South Africa would be a shadow of their normal selves, with no Cullinan, no Donald, no Kirsten, and - for once - no sense of a settled side. They did all they could to lose the tournament, and still ended up winning it comfortably, because England, though only awful on one occasion, were often ordinary. Still, second place is second place, and at least they competed. Result: a qualified YES 2. Bed in a new opening pair Nasser Hussain and Nick Knight had never opened together in a major match, because Hussain became an opener only when - in a dreadful, panicky piece of selection - Knight was dropped on the eve of the World Cup. \"They have all the balance you could ask for,\" we argued - \"left- and right-hander, blaster and barnacle. But does Hussain have any runs left in him at the end of a long tour, and will he manage to refrain from running Knight out?\" The answers to those questions were \"yes\" and \"yes, just\". The new opening pair were England's best batsmen. In fact most days they were our only batsmen. And they should never have been opening in the final. That was a pitch on which any team was going to lose early wickets. South Africa had taken the precaution of bringing a middle order with them. England hadn't. Knight should have opened with a pinch-hitter, White or Ealham or Read, in the hope of at least dispersing the slips and getting the target down below 120. Hussain should have held himself back to No 5 or 6 to play a captain's innings like Cronje. Result: another YES with reservations 3. Field as well as\u00c9 \"I was going to say the South Africans, but some observers, amazingly, felt that England had the edge in this department as the Test series went on.\" And they kept it up, on the whole, in the one-dayers, rising to the occasion in the final with a series of scintillating catches. This has been the best thing about the Duncan Fletcher regime. Result: a triumphant YES 4. Get runs out of Chris Read \"He should get the run in the side that he has been denied at Test level,\" we said. \"And Duncan Fletcher has got to find a way of squeezing some runs out of him \u00c9 Needs to improvise like his glove-mentors, Alan Knott and Jack Russell, and be good for a bustling 20.\" He did it once, in style, reducing Shaun Pollock to stunned silence with a glorious six in the penultimate over at Cape Town. And he did get a settled place in the side, once the horrible idea of giving the gloves to Mark Alleyne had been shelved. But his batting was all icing and no cake. In the final, admittedly when all was lost, he stayed in for longer than anyone else (70 minutes) but made only nine runs, and farmed the strike so ineffectually that Alan Mullally faced more balls than he did, in less time. In Zimbabwe, Read must add the string to his bow that most keepers can offer with their eyes shut: the nudge and nurdle that keeps the scoreboard ticking. Result: Half a YES 5. Set attacking fields \"The one disappointment of Nasser Hussain's captaincy in the Tests was a tendency to go on the defensive,\" quoth we. \"When in Rome, behave in a way the Roman isn't used to. Keep a slip in throughout a one-day innings \u00c9\" Hmmmm. If Nasser had done that in the final, England might have won. In Sunday's Wisden Verdict, Simon Briggs rightly said that Nasser's decision to take Gough off was fatal. But even when he came back on, he didn't have a slip. Cronje, at times, posted three slips for Pollock, and he is not one of nature's buccaneers. Result: a disappointing NO 6. Get Gough's reverse-swing going again He was a different man once he pulled on the naff blue shirt. He took as many wickets as Shaun Pollock (14), at a marginally better average (14 not 15). Result: a resounding YES 7. Name a vice-captain \"President Nasser has a poor record in this area,\" we said, \"having already shared the job out between Graham Thorpe, Mark Butcher and Alec Stewart in the space of nine Tests, as well as giving Graeme Hick a go \u00c9\" Who the vice-captain was, we never did discover. Come on Nass. Even Tony Blair has an official No 2. Result: a resounding NO 8. Add two players to the core of the team \"I'm very pleased with the progress our side is making,\" Hussain said after the final. \"There are definite areas we've got to improve, but we've got some good young lads coming through.\" Excuse me, but who are they?

Brian Cowen and I intend to follow this up urgently, first by exploring with General de Chastelain what lies behind Friday's report.

With the power to make decisions that affect the daily lives of local people.</p> <p>And each and every one of those Ministers, regardless of political affiliation, have fulfilled our highest expectations: that they are the right people to govern Northern Ireland. Government of Northern Ireland from outside Northern Ireland is inferior to inclusive self government of Northern Ireland.</p> <p>The Good Friday Agreement created a framework of north-south institutions for practical co-operation between Ireland and Northern Ireland.

That's why the talks that Brian Cowen and I are initiating with the parties today are so urgent.</p> <p>In the last 72 hours, some harsh words have been spoken. That is perhaps not surprising.

I am no fan of gesture politics. But the generosity of spirit and imagination on all sides that have got us this far must not fail us now.</p> <p>Taking the necessary final steps - and risks - on the way means each side understanding the mindset of the other.</p> <p>It means, in particular, republicans understanding better why unionists are reluctant to join in government without more definitive progress on the arms issue.

But we should not be afraid of the men and women whose gaze is firmly backwards, whose justification is some eccentric notion that nations can be built on violence and intimidation and cite a spurious analysis of history in support.</p> <p>Or equally, those who refuse to admit that change is either possible or desirable. Those who prefer the certainties of past conflict to the uncertainties of future reconciliation.</p> <p>They have not deterred us in the past and they never will.</p> <p>That's why I am committed, as I was before devolution, to good government in the interests of all the people of Northern Ireland, irrespective of their tradition or political allegiance.</p> <p>That's why I propose to continue to advance the programmes of positive reform that flow from the Good Friday Agreement.</p> <p>Because the Good Friday Agreement envisaged not just a new constitution, but fundamental changes to the political and social fabric of Northern Ireland.</p> <p>The Agreement has given Northern Ireland some of the most sophisticated rights and equality arrangements in the world.</p> <p>But rights cannot simply be tacked on to the systems and institutions of government - we must actively seek new and imaginative ways to encourage respect for rights and equality in every area of public life. Everywhere from employment to policing and parades - all areas that must advance regardless of the state of political progress.</p> <p>I have faced calls to suspend the implementation of the Patten report on policing while the institutions are on hold.</p> <p>This is just not possible. In the words of the Chief Constable 'the vast bulk of the recommendations are simply about good and effective policing'.</p> <p>Policing is not a partisan issue to be traded as if it were part of some political scoresheet and it must not be used to give comfort to any political party. I have not done that to date and I am not going to start now, however much I respect the right of any politician to express their view on the subject.</p> <p>I know the passions that reform of the RUC arouses, particularly the prospect of a new name and changed badge. I have heard at first hand, many times, the harrowing stories of how these symbols have come to mean so much to so many people in the RUC family who experienced tragedy.</p> <p>But a nine to one religious imbalance cannot be allowed to continue. A police service that is not representative of the society it serves cannot hope to be fully effective. It cannot hope to draw support and strength from all parts of the community.</p> <p>We must not rest until all the pillars of the state command the same respect, inspire the same sense of ownership across the community in Northern Ireland. Until the state and its agencies truly are representative of and responsive to the society it serves.</p> <p>So much, though, has changed already in a positive direction in Northern Ireland. And you in the BIIPB have seen at close quarters the great advances that the last ten years have brought. From terrible violence, political instability and little hope of anything better.</p> <p>I am determined to work harder still to build confidence in the Good Friday Agreement and to create the conditions for the swift return of devolved government.</p> <p>And I will do all I can to encourage the incremental shifts that have brought ceasefires, then the Good Friday Agreement, then devolution.</p> <p>The shifts that will one day secure truly democratic government and an unbreakable peace in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>Those are our goals. And we need each other - indeed, unionists need nationalists who need republicans who need unionists - to achieve those goals. That recognition was the mainspring of the Good Friday Agreement. It remains so. It is what will carry us forward.</p>",

I have not done that to date and I am not going to start now, however much I respect the right of any politician to express their view on the subject. I know the passions that reform of the RUC arouses, particularly the prospect of a new name and changed badge. I have heard at first hand, many times, the harrowing stories of how these symbols have come to mean so much to so many people in the RUC family who experienced tragedy. But a nine to one religious imbalance cannot be allowed to continue. A police service that is not representative of the society it serves cannot hope to be fully effective. It cannot hope to draw support and strength from all parts of the community. We must not rest until all the pillars of the state command the same respect, inspire the same sense of ownership across the community in Northern Ireland. Until the state and its agencies truly are representative of and responsive to the society it serves. So much, though, has changed already in a positive direction in Northern Ireland. And you in the BIIPB have seen at close quarters the great advances that the last ten years have brought. From terrible violence, political instability and little hope of anything better. I am determined to work harder still to build confidence in the Good Friday Agreement and to create the conditions for the swift return of devolved government. And I will do all I can to encourage the incremental shifts that have brought ceasefires, then the Good Friday Agreement, then devolution. The shifts that will one day secure truly democratic government and an unbreakable peace in Northern Ireland. Those are our goals. And we need each other - indeed, unionists need nationalists who need republicans who need unionists - to achieve those goals. That recognition was the mainspring of the Good Friday Agreement. It remains so. It is what will carry us forward.",

Clinics must bear in mind factors such as the prospective parents' ages and their likely future ability to look after, or provide for, a child's needs, and any risk of harm to the child or children who may be born.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The battle for editors of women's glossies now will not be how to put on new readers, but how to maintain existing ones. While last week's circulation figures revealed the significant fact that OK! has finally overtaken its arch rival Hello! with a quite remarkable year-on-year increase in sales of 37.7% (what are they doing right?), the trend for the traditional titles in the past 10 years has been a downhill one. The overall loss of readers since 1987 is well over a million readers. </p> <p>This fact has not passed without the requisite amount of paranoia behind closed doors, reflected by the redistribution of human resources - or large number of sackings - in major publishing houses. In news-papers, the perennial debate about the state of women's magazines has reached fever pitch in the past two years: from the Daily Mail to the Guardian, they have been denounced as \"an insult to womanhood\", \"sex-crazed and salacious\", or just boring and old hat. </p> <p>Are they really that bad, or are there just too many out there? In an over-saturated, oxygen-depleted marketplace, even the more illustrious titles such as Elle have been forced out on to the sawdust of the market floor to scrap for readers: fighting mere \"sex\" coverlines with \"bigger, bolder sex\" and resorting to plastering free goods all over the front of the magazine. </p> <p>Reader loyalty seems to be a luxury of the past - according to some estimates it is down 30% compared to five years ago. As for advertising loyalty - was it ever there in the first place? With women readers accounting for 30% of the sales of men's magazines, a market growing ever stronger (a growth rate of 674% between 1993 and 1998) and more pornographic, the women's sector looks like a universe in decline. </p> <p>There have been some launches since 1996: Frank, which settled at around 40,000 and was effectively folded by Wagadon; and Red and B, launched with the full muscle of Emap and Attic Futura respectively behind them. But more newcomers have arrived over the same period in the healthier men's market, which has supported the launch of Maxim, Bizarre, Front and several health titles. </p> <p>Sally O'Sullivan, ex-editor of Good Housekeeping and chief executive of Cabal - the star of the BBC2 series Trouble Between the Covers - believes that ever-fewer women's magazines reflect the life, aspirations and emotions of the readers: \"Eventually the gap between the lifestyle of the readers and the static nature of the current brands will show - unless they can move fast enough. The magazines with longevity are the ones that have grown with society - evolution is what it's all about.\" </p> <p>Amidst all the Ab Fab-style panic and the desperate sales-boosting tactics, one title stands out. Vogue's sales figures are more robust than ever at 202,668, with 25,000 more readers put on since editor Alexandra Shulman came on board, and it has so far resisted the fads and faux pas of the marketplace. Its millennium issue was a sell-out. </p> <p>While others fought for celebrities on their covers, Vogue left its own blank, using self-reflective mirrored silver. The fashion journal which launched in 1916, monitored hemline movements through two world wars, and met the challenge of women's lib, effortlessly claimed \"A Century of Style\" as its own. It confidently straddled the millennium with one Blahnik heel resting in the 20th century and the other lodged firmly in the future. </p> <p>Although its rival Elle sells more copies (210,076), it is not Elle that fashion devotees turn to to find out what's in. Only Vogue has the gravitas to sweep the board clean and start a new look. Just as we've spent our wages in haberdashery trying to get \"the shamanic look\", the February issue heralds \"The New Chic\", a return to 70s smart. </p> <p>It's enough to make other editors sick. \"There's Vogue on this one level and then there's all the rest,\" says Andrew Wiles, head of advertising at Harrods, which sponsored the February catwalk guide. \"Vogue has the authority in terms of fashion positioning - it's stuck to its identity.\" Advertisers use it as the trade showcase for repositioning brands. </p> <p>What is it about Vogue? Its readers are the same pill-popping, stressed and overworked women, worried about men and their bodies, who read other glossies, but Vogue doesn't stoop to their level or try to be their best friend. It inspires them to jump up to those misty spires: the perfect pair of legs clad in the most divine dress. </p> <p>\"We have to be more luscious than every other magazine,\" says Shulman. \"People are going to carry on buying Vogue for all the same reasons: something to wallow in . . . an enormous treat.\" Shulman was employed to keep \"Vogue as Vogue\", but that's not as simple as it sounds. \"You have to hard-sell every issue,\" she says. Vogue has a core readership - about two-thirds - who are very loyal, but the rest, mainly aged 26 and under, are floaters. Despite the pressure from rivals, Shulman has so far shunned covermounts: \"I edit a magazine, not a supermarket.\" </p> <p>She has, to some extent, resisted the all-consuming pull of Celebrity. The biggest threat to Cond\u00e9 Nast titles in the US has been the sweeping success of In Style, a super-glossy lifestyle magazine which focuses on celebrities and is soon to launch in Britain. Shulman's January issue had a roll-call of \"now\" celebrities on its cover, but she is quick to dismiss this as \"a one-off\". </p> <p>\"Vogue doesn't sell on celebrity covers - we only do about four to five a year.\" She is not prepared to guarantee a front cover in return for an interview and is \"bloody minded\" in dealing with PRs. \"In Style is a brilliant magazine - we have elements of it in that we give people a view into a glamorous world. But the US is a bigger market and more commercial. We are able to be more edgy, less formulaic.\" There are certainly more celebrities than her predecessor Liz Tilberis allowed (a former employee remembers pushing hard to get Madonna during her voguing phase and was told firmly \"not in this magazine\"). </p> <p>Vogue has been modernised by Shulman, who in 1992 returned to the magazine, where she had been features editor, after editing GQ. \"I thought it had become a little irrelevant - showing gorgeous models and nothing else.\" Society has also changed. Vogue once appealed to a narrow echelon of British society. Now we are all supposed to be middle class. </p> <p>\"Vogue is classless. It's not about class, it's about style. When I took over, England was in the midst of a recession - the fallout from the good-time 80s. It was straight out of glittery power suits into grunge, with photographers wanting to take more realistic photos. Luckily, it was more my taste.\" </p> <p>Fashion literacy has improved enormously since then. \"Vogue used to be either for very rich people, or people who looked at it with their noses pressed up against the window,\" says Lisa Armstrong, the Times's fashion editor and a Vogue contributor. \"Now women want to buy into the whole thing - if they can't get the clothes, they'll buy the handbag.\" </p> <p>\"If you've got the privilege of editing Vogue, then you've got to make sure that every now and then you do something that ups the trend,\" says Shulman. Such moments might include the Kate Moss-in-tiny-knickers shock, followed by a shoot with a size 16 model, or more recently an article about \"bi-try\", inspired by the rumours of threesomes among the glamorous London set. </p> <p>\"Vogue transcends the demands that other mags have. People buy it to be different, to be special.

      "bodyText": "The battle for editors of women's glossies now will not be how to put on new readers, but how to maintain existing ones. While last week's circulation figures revealed the significant fact that OK! has finally overtaken its arch rival Hello! with a quite remarkable year-on-year increase in sales of 37.7% (what are they doing right?), the trend for the traditional titles in the past 10 years has been a downhill one. The overall loss of readers since 1987 is well over a million readers. This fact has not passed without the requisite amount of paranoia behind closed doors, reflected by the redistribution of human resources - or large number of sackings - in major publishing houses. In news-papers, the perennial debate about the state of women's magazines has reached fever pitch in the past two years: from the Daily Mail to the Guardian, they have been denounced as \"an insult to womanhood\", \"sex-crazed and salacious\", or just boring and old hat. Are they really that bad, or are there just too many out there? In an over-saturated, oxygen-depleted marketplace, even the more illustrious titles such as Elle have been forced out on to the sawdust of the market floor to scrap for readers: fighting mere \"sex\" coverlines with \"bigger, bolder sex\" and resorting to plastering free goods all over the front of the magazine. Reader loyalty seems to be a luxury of the past - according to some estimates it is down 30% compared to five years ago. As for advertising loyalty - was it ever there in the first place? With women readers accounting for 30% of the sales of men's magazines, a market growing ever stronger (a growth rate of 674% between 1993 and 1998) and more pornographic, the women's sector looks like a universe in decline. There have been some launches since 1996: Frank, which settled at around 40,000 and was effectively folded by Wagadon; and Red and B, launched with the full muscle of Emap and Attic Futura respectively behind them. But more newcomers have arrived over the same period in the healthier men's market, which has supported the launch of Maxim, Bizarre, Front and several health titles. Sally O'Sullivan, ex-editor of Good Housekeeping and chief executive of Cabal - the star of the BBC2 series Trouble Between the Covers - believes that ever-fewer women's magazines reflect the life, aspirations and emotions of the readers: \"Eventually the gap between the lifestyle of the readers and the static nature of the current brands will show - unless they can move fast enough. The magazines with longevity are the ones that have grown with society - evolution is what it's all about.\" Amidst all the Ab Fab-style panic and the desperate sales-boosting tactics, one title stands out. Vogue's sales figures are more robust than ever at 202,668, with 25,000 more readers put on since editor Alexandra Shulman came on board, and it has so far resisted the fads and faux pas of the marketplace. Its millennium issue was a sell-out. While others fought for celebrities on their covers, Vogue left its own blank, using self-reflective mirrored silver. The fashion journal which launched in 1916, monitored hemline movements through two world wars, and met the challenge of women's lib, effortlessly claimed \"A Century of Style\" as its own. It confidently straddled the millennium with one Blahnik heel resting in the 20th century and the other lodged firmly in the future. Although its rival Elle sells more copies (210,076), it is not Elle that fashion devotees turn to to find out what's in. Only Vogue has the gravitas to sweep the board clean and start a new look. Just as we've spent our wages in haberdashery trying to get \"the shamanic look\", the February issue heralds \"The New Chic\", a return to 70s smart. It's enough to make other editors sick. \"There's Vogue on this one level and then there's all the rest,\" says Andrew Wiles, head of advertising at Harrods, which sponsored the February catwalk guide. \"Vogue has the authority in terms of fashion positioning - it's stuck to its identity.\" Advertisers use it as the trade showcase for repositioning brands. What is it about Vogue? Its readers are the same pill-popping, stressed and overworked women, worried about men and their bodies, who read other glossies, but Vogue doesn't stoop to their level or try to be their best friend. It inspires them to jump up to those misty spires: the perfect pair of legs clad in the most divine dress. \"We have to be more luscious than every other magazine,\" says Shulman. \"People are going to carry on buying Vogue for all the same reasons: something to wallow in . . . an enormous treat.\" Shulman was employed to keep \"Vogue as Vogue\", but that's not as simple as it sounds. \"You have to hard-sell every issue,\" she says. Vogue has a core readership - about two-thirds - who are very loyal, but the rest, mainly aged 26 and under, are floaters. Despite the pressure from rivals, Shulman has so far shunned covermounts: \"I edit a magazine, not a supermarket.\" She has, to some extent, resisted the all-consuming pull of Celebrity. The biggest threat to Cond\u00e9 Nast titles in the US has been the sweeping success of In Style, a super-glossy lifestyle magazine which focuses on celebrities and is soon to launch in Britain. Shulman's January issue had a roll-call of \"now\" celebrities on its cover, but she is quick to dismiss this as \"a one-off\". \"Vogue doesn't sell on celebrity covers - we only do about four to five a year.\" She is not prepared to guarantee a front cover in return for an interview and is \"bloody minded\" in dealing with PRs. \"In Style is a brilliant magazine - we have elements of it in that we give people a view into a glamorous world. But the US is a bigger market and more commercial. We are able to be more edgy, less formulaic.\" There are certainly more celebrities than her predecessor Liz Tilberis allowed (a former employee remembers pushing hard to get Madonna during her voguing phase and was told firmly \"not in this magazine\"). Vogue has been modernised by Shulman, who in 1992 returned to the magazine, where she had been features editor, after editing GQ. \"I thought it had become a little irrelevant - showing gorgeous models and nothing else.\" Society has also changed. Vogue once appealed to a narrow echelon of British society. Now we are all supposed to be middle class. \"Vogue is classless. It's not about class, it's about style. When I took over, England was in the midst of a recession - the fallout from the good-time 80s. It was straight out of glittery power suits into grunge, with photographers wanting to take more realistic photos. Luckily, it was more my taste.\" Fashion literacy has improved enormously since then. \"Vogue used to be either for very rich people, or people who looked at it with their noses pressed up against the window,\" says Lisa Armstrong, the Times's fashion editor and a Vogue contributor. \"Now women want to buy into the whole thing - if they can't get the clothes, they'll buy the handbag.\" \"If you've got the privilege of editing Vogue, then you've got to make sure that every now and then you do something that ups the trend,\" says Shulman. Such moments might include the Kate Moss-in-tiny-knickers shock, followed by a shoot with a size 16 model, or more recently an article about \"bi-try\", inspired by the rumours of threesomes among the glamorous London set. \"Vogue transcends the demands that other mags have. People buy it to be different, to be special. We are not out there clawing away, trying to get a circ of 400,000.\" She does not want a gigantic circulation (\"that would be more people than could possibly be relevant to our advertisers\") but selling more copies makes her feel good. \"When I came here, there was this ethos that the magazine really didn't need more readers. It didn't matter as long as we were Vogue and I've always thought that was nonsense.\" She saw off the competition from Frank, when it was launched directly at intelligent, fashion-fascist Vogue readers. \"Frank wanted to be more upmarket than us but it was not very commercial in its approach.\" Shulman had already stolen the middle ground. \"Guardian woman makes up a huge section of our readers,\" says Shulman. \"It's my newspaper, after all.\" Vogue now has two key ex-Frank staff on the team.

It has to be something different otherwise you're selling on people's nostalgia and you'll not live up to it. \"I'm not quite convinced that there isn't a gap for a more upmarket, high-fashion magazine than Vogue, but if there is, it won't sell more than 80,000 copies.\" Vogue could stretch to another 20,000 sales, \"but it's not something I would try to do - our challenge is to stay where we are.\"",

      "body": "<p>This week, the New Yorker celebrates its 75th anniversary with a 300-page bumper edition that finds many of its past contributors tempted back into the flattering typeface of the fabled publication. </p> <p>Likely as not, the week will also see additions to that vast file of articles about the title - one that still counts to most as the finest execution of magazine publishing - that will complement some 22 books that have been written about it. </p> <p>Of those books, seven are being published on this anniversary. Among them are Letters from the Editor, a collection of the words of founder Harold Ross, About Town: The New Yorker and the World it Made by Ben Yagoda, John Seabrook's Nobrow, a deconstruction of the Tina Brown era during which, he argues, the New Yorker's identity was lost in the blurring of high- and low-brow culture, and the American publication of Alexander Chancellor's memoir of being an employee under Brown. </p> <p>In addition, the current editor of the magazine, David Remnick, has edited two compilations of New Yorker writing over the years, Wonderful Town: New York Stories from The New Yorker and Life Stories: Profiles from the New Yorker. They effectively substantiate the magazine's reputation as a home to some of America's best writing. </p> <p>But no good birthday passes without a good fight. And Renata Adler, a contributor to the magazine from 1963 to 1979, has stirred up a literary squall with her book Gone: The Last Days of the New Yorker in which she argues that what made the magazine great has long since departed. \"As I write this, The New Yorker is dead. It still comes out week after week, or almost every week . . . Otherwise, not a single defining element of the magazine remains,\" is Adler's opening attack on the first page. </p> <p>Her definition of the elements that combined to produce what she calls the golden age [roughly 1946 to 1980] include \"the look, the format, the content, the humour, the level of seriousness; the ambition at the top; the standards in the middle; the limits below which it would not sink.\" </p> <p>Though the specifics will not mean much to British readers, Adler goes on to eviscerate editors William Shawn and Robert Gottlieb current owner SI Newhouse, settle old scores with fellow writers, and generally depict the institution as a vipers' nest of poisonous flatterers and charlatans. </p> <p>Reaction to Adler's tirade was largely one of surprise, both for its force and for its reading of history. \"Part wacky, part unpleasant,\" noted Gottlieb, as the American press ran a series of gleefully critical pieces about the magazine. </p> <p>Adler's attack fits nicely into the long tradition of writers assaulting each other with bitterness and has given commentators a chance to reach for their best prose and weigh in on the New Yorker's past and present merits and wonder who or what killed it if it is dead. </p> <p>After reading more than 3,500 issues in preparation of the anthologies, Remnick must have a better understanding than almost anyone of how the magazine came to occupy such a high place in American culture, and of its progression since it began life as a humour magazine in 1925 and then broadened and deepened - the term \"profile\" was a creation of the magazine. </p> <p>Sitting in the conference room adjoining his office on the 20th floor of Cond\u00e9 Nast's sleek new headquarters in Times Square after a late night closing the issue, he is careful not be drawn deeply into the debate. \"In so far that the mystique is a sustained compliment to the magazine, I welcome it. But in so far that it regards the magazine as some sort of religion, I find it uninteresting,\" he says. </p> <p>Indeed, he finds the elitist fascination that propels the debate largely tiresome. \"I have a hard time believing that beyond the media bubble of certain precincts of Manhattan it matters to anyone. It's just gossip . . . it's the magazine equivalent of caring more about TS Eliot's marriages than his work. What matters to readers is the issue they get in the mail.\" </p> <p>Remnick, a former sports writer, Moscow correspondent of the Washington Post and author of the well-received Muhammad Ali biography, King of the World, has now been in the editor's chair for 19 months. The erruptions that greeted Brown were absent and his succession was a popular choice amongst the New Yorker staff. He is, after all, a known and respected quantity. </p> <p>As a keen student of its history and able to pinpoint which famous writers were published and when, he's also acutely aware of the New Yorker's lapses. \"The New Yorker's achievements are many. However, it pub lished Bernard Malamud, Saul Bellow and Philip Roth rather lightly,\" he says revealing an earnestness. \"Indeed, one of the things I did in my first week was to take out the fiction we had and publish a portion of Roth's book I Married a Communist.\" </p> <p>Many say that the publication was placed in his hands after its proprietor, SI Newhouse, grew tired of the constant criticism that the magazine had dumbed down and, by default, that he was responsible for the ruination of an American institution. To add insult to injury it was also losing him millions of dollars. </p> <p>It would be wrong to regard Remnick as a kind of custodian charged with returning a greater sense of sobriety and measure to the weekly. It does lean toward being less frenetic and noisy than it was under his predecessor and it's a good deal less Anglo-centric. </p> <p>For any New Yorker editor, criticism comes with the territory. Some say its more dull, that you need a bit of trashiness to keep things buoyant; others that it's been enriched by Remnick's beefed-up arts and cultural criticism and returned somewhat to the principle of attraction rather than promotion. </p> <p>The feature stories and special issues tend to be less of the moment for the moment's sake (no fashion issues in fashion week, for instance) and more interested in the world beyond that which can be spied from the high floors of a Manhattan skyscraper. </p> <p>The anthology of profiles Remnick prepared for the anniversary makes clear that some of the best writing in the magazine during the so-called golden age that critics love to exult was often about the emergent figures of the day. </p> <p>\"Kenneth Tynan wrote a series of profiles which are among the best ever written in the New Yorker. They were not about medieval scholars or Gregorian chants. They were about Johnny Carson, Mel Brooks, John Gielgud. Was that noisy? I don't know. Certainly they tell me a lot about that world. It's become harder and harder to write about certain kinds of public figures, athletes, actors, directors, all the people that have press agents,\" he points out. \"They're much more on their guard, they parcel out their time just enough to get the requisite publicity. If there's somebody we're interested in and all we're going to get is 45 minutes in a hotel room with a publicist having her own tape-recorder rolling then to hell with it.\" </p> <p>Remnick's appointment came just as Cond\u00e9 Nast folded the backroom affairs of the New Yorker into that of its other, glossier titles. Many feared that in an effort to stem mounting losses its independence would somehow be compromised. </p> <p>But Remnick says there have been no creeping efforts to tailor editorial to the interest of advertisers (\"Not only would it be wrong, it would be dumb\"), no dramatic budget cutting, nor any proprietorial nudging. \"There's been no instruction. No 'you must publish so-and-so because I met them at a cocktail party'. No wink-wink, 'I have a special interest in such-and-such'. Nothing. Zero. The degree to which it's given to you to make of it what you will is really quite breathtaking.\" </p> <p>Though advertising is up, the New Yorker is not profitable nor, he says, is it prudent to suggest when it will become so. \"I have every reason to believe the magazine will become economically healthy, but we have a way to go. The one thing that's close to perfect is the circulation [around 800,000] and the subscription renewal rate is the highest it's ever been at 75-80%. Evidently, once you're hooked, your hooked.\" </p> <p>Under Remnick, the New Yorker looks set to remain an idiosyncratic publication. To this day it does not have a masthead, a hangover from the years when it displayed neither a table of contents nor displayed the names of its writers prominently. </p> <p>The anniversary issue out this week promises to be a tour-de-force: Joan Didion on Martha Stewart, Janet Malcolm on Chekhov, Wendy Wasserstein on getting pregnant at 49, a reporting piece from Cuba by John Lee Anderson, Woody Allen's first piece in 20 years and fiction by Alison Munro, Steve Martin and John Lahr. </p> <p>It won't satisfy everyone and the argument over the New Yorker in another 75 years will probably still be as intractable as it is today. It is, in effect, a special kind of Manhattan sport. Yet Remnick does not appear encumbered by the weight of its history, or distracted by the clutter and noise of the media below. \"I will not rest easy until I know all aspects of the New Yorker are in place,\" he assures.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The newspaper cartoon strip is part of the American way of life in a way that it never really has been - pace If . . . , Andy Capp, the Broons, Fred Bassett and the Gambols - in Britain. Many US papers run a couple of dozen every morning and when Charles Schulz announced that Peanuts was about to end after nearly 50 years because his cancer made it impossible for him to continue, a nation mourned as though a real death had occurred. </p> <p>Some of the cartoons date back decades, from Rex Morgan MD to the Wizard of Id, from Blondie to the Amazing Spider-Man, and are as much a part of the country's shared cultural history as television quiz shows, Dear Abby and baseball caps. As Guardian readers might expect, Garry Trudeau's Doonesbury is an essential daily starting point for liberal America. </p> <p>But rarely do the cartoons make their presence felt on other pages of the newspaper. Until, that was, the arrival of the Boondocks, a strip that has created a stir sufficient enough to make it the subject of intense debate in news and letter pages across the US. It has provoked both a fierce loyalty from its admirers and an angry reaction from its detractors, leading to a debate between readers and their papers about the role of the cartoon. The key questions are to do with race, humour and the American condition. </p> <p>The creation of a young artist called Aaron McGruder, the Boondocks began its life four years ago as an online strip on a small website. At the time McGruder, now 25, was studying African-American history and computer graphics at the University of Maryland and the strip duly graduated to his campus newspaper, the Diamondbacker, and from there to the music paper, the Source. </p> <p>After completing his degree, McGruder sent his work off to the main syndicates that control most of the cartoons in America's newspa pers. A stack of rejection slips returned but just over two years ago he went to the National Association of Black Journalists' annual convention where an executive from one of the main syndicates, Universal Press, spotted the strip's potential. Last year it was launched nationally and it now appears in more than 250 daily papers in the US, others in the Caribbean and South Africa and has earned McGruder a contract worth six figures over five years. </p> <p>The central character is a scornful and hard-to-please black schoolboy called Huey Freeman, named after the Black Panther, Huey P Newton. His family has just moved from the inner city of Chicago to a white suburb and Huey is on the lookout for racism, whether overt or covert. His fellow protagonists include his best friend, the outgoing Caesar, from Brooklyn; Jazmine DuBois, a sweet and rather confused bi-racial girl - her hair is \"frizzy\", she says, not an Afro; and Huey's full-on little brother, Riley, who has bought into the gangsta culture. Cindy is the white girl thrilled at the street-cred rap 'n' basketball possibilities of her new neighbours and who offends Huey by doing Puff Daddy imitations. Adults feature mainly as creatures unable to understand the complexities of life and music. </p> <p>While most strips meander gently through life's little complexities, as seen perhaps through the eyes of a dog or a cat, the Boondocks cheerfully deals with some of the most delicate issues in America today: race, drugs, violence, education. Only last week, the strip was cut from a Georgia newspaper unhappy with episodes about the singer Whitney Houston and the alleged seizure from her in a Hawaii airport of a bag of marijuana. Papers in South Carolina and Ohio have dropped the strip after complaints from readers but others have hailed it as a breath of fresh air on the sometimes rather predictably humdrum \"funnies\" page. </p> <p>When the Los Angeles Times, which carries 27 strips a day, first ran it last year more than 100 letters of complaint flooded in. \"This is a depiction of angry black children bent on killing,\" wrote one university sociology researcher who threatened to cancel her subscription if the cartoon continued. </p> <p>The Times has backed McGruder but other papers have been challenged by readers who claim that they would not run anything as strong from a white cartoonist. Complaints have predictably come from people who do not want to share their morning Corn Pops with a stroppy, young black kid but also from readers who say that they feel it presents a negative image of black people. </p> <p>The Boondocks is certainly different from most strips, with the obvious exception of Doonesbury, in that it deals with the kind of issues that are normally left for the op-ed pages: the Ku Klux Klan, black history, tokenism. But McGruder deals with them without preaching, often gently mocking the lines Huey draws between right-on and wrong. Many of the issues are from McGruder's own background: like Huey, he was born in Chicago before moving to the white suburbs, initially in Champaign, Illinois, then Louisville, Kentucky before settling in Columbia, Maryland, in 1980. He, too, was used to being one of the few black faces in a classroom of white ones. His frames of reference are wide, from veteran black activist and academic Angela Davis to the Backstreet Boys. </p> <p>\"People are amazed that I say the things I say to mainstream America,\" says McGruder, who now lives in Los Feliz, one of the more interesting districts of Los Angeles. \"But really it shouldn't be that big a deal. The problem is that information is so controlled and limited in this country that other perspectives are quickly seen as offensive or subversive. I'm coming from a hip-hop foundation which is about honest, creative expression that isn't watered down or scared. I'm coming from the perspective that if you have something to say you should say it without fear or hesitation but with great thought and preparation.\" </p> <p>Has he been surprised by the reaction to the Boondocks? \"America is very immature on race - we haven't really grown up,\" says McGruder. Having studied African-American history for so many years, he says he is used to having casual conversations about colonialism, different philosophies of black activism and self-identity, and had not realised how puzzling or threatening this might be to some readers. </p> <p>McGruder, who takes his artistic inspiration from Japanese animators, accepts that the Boondocks will be subject to much more scrutiny than the more conventional new arrivals on the scene and that it will be viewed through the nation's racial prism. He is one of only five syndicated black artists among hundreds of white cartoonists. \"I have a responsibility to the black community to represent us accurately and depict us in both writing and art in a way which black people will be proud of and allow their children to read. It has been really important to me to try and show the beauty of black children artistically, show the intelligence and sophistication of young black kids today. Black people are going to be watching very closely to see if you misrepresent something - and for good reason: they've been horribly misrepresented in the past.\" </p> <p>He feels that the overwhelming response to his creation has been good. \"I would say it's an indicator that while America has a long way to go before it tackles its racial issues, people from all walks of life are ready to start talking about things openly and addressing these taboo issues with candour and honesty.\" He feels the strip has many \"curious onlookers\" who are not quite sure how to take what the characters say. </p> <p>Some of the criticisms, he says, have come from \"whites who simply cannot stand the thought of dealing with black people on our own terms. When we demonstrate true independence of thought and action we are accused of widening the racial gap. It's as if the 'acceptance' of black equality is conditional to our behaving and speaking as much like white people as possible.\" </p> <p>It is the cartoon strip that has brought McGruder recognition - although his website (boondocks.net) claims that he still has \"no BMW, no Benz, not a single item of clothing from Versace\" - but he says he is not wedded to it as a form. A book of the strip will be out later this year and an animated version is already underway and will hit television screens in 2001. But he likes the simplicity and directness of the daily strip. \"It's a great medium because there's so little standing in between myself and the readers.\" And when some papers decide to censor an episode or two, his website provides the missing links for deprived readers and his growing army of fans. </p> <p>The cartoon strip can have a wonderfully subversive effect as followers of underground comic artists such as Robert Crumb and Gilbert Shelton, the creators of Mr Natural and the Furry Freak Brothers, discovered in the 60s and 70s. They and others helped to spawn a new generation of cartoonists both in the United States and Europe who saw the form as a simple way of reaching readers who were resistant to worthy editorialising but responsive to seeing what they could identify with - drugs, sloth, trouble with the law - being reflected on the printed page. </p> <p>McGruder is also reaching an audience that previously may have felt that the funnies were for their parents rather than them and his success has already prompted other young artists to see if they can enter the hallowed gates where BC and Dilbert, Garfield and Citizen Dog roam free. </p> <p>It can still, of course, be a delicate business tiptoeing through the minefields on an unmarked path between what offends and what stimulates. Last year Rutgers university in New Jersey found itself attacked after the campus newspaper had run a strip about a fictional town called Hicksville. One girl in the strip suggests that black people got \"a free ride\" to which another character replies: \"on a slave ship\". The editors, one black, one white, apologised for causing offence. </p> <p>McGruder, whose guiding light is Yoda from Star Wars, is anxious to continue to try and push the boundaries of the form. The rather sterile presidential race currently under way offers plenty of ammunition. Over the past week, the ever-critical Huey has been watching television and discovering that Beavis and Butthead can sometimes provide rather more mature intellectual debate than Gore and Bradley, Bush and McCain. </p> <p>Perhaps, in a small way, nothing better signifies the way the United States may change in the new century than the passing of the comforting beagle and his chums and the arrival of the uncompromising Huey and his.</p>",

The Times has backed McGruder but other papers have been challenged by readers who claim that they would not run anything as strong from a white cartoonist. Complaints have predictably come from people who do not want to share their morning Corn Pops with a stroppy, young black kid but also from readers who say that they feel it presents a negative image of black people. The Boondocks is certainly different from most strips, with the obvious exception of Doonesbury, in that it deals with the kind of issues that are normally left for the op-ed pages: the Ku Klux Klan, black history, tokenism. But McGruder deals with them without preaching, often gently mocking the lines Huey draws between right-on and wrong. Many of the issues are from McGruder's own background: like Huey, he was born in Chicago before moving to the white suburbs, initially in Champaign, Illinois, then Louisville, Kentucky before settling in Columbia, Maryland, in 1980. He, too, was used to being one of the few black faces in a classroom of white ones. His frames of reference are wide, from veteran black activist and academic Angela Davis to the Backstreet Boys. \"People are amazed that I say the things I say to mainstream America,\" says McGruder, who now lives in Los Feliz, one of the more interesting districts of Los Angeles. \"But really it shouldn't be that big a deal. The problem is that information is so controlled and limited in this country that other perspectives are quickly seen as offensive or subversive. I'm coming from a hip-hop foundation which is about honest, creative expression that isn't watered down or scared. I'm coming from the perspective that if you have something to say you should say it without fear or hesitation but with great thought and preparation.\" Has he been surprised by the reaction to the Boondocks? \"America is very immature on race - we haven't really grown up,\" says McGruder. Having studied African-American history for so many years, he says he is used to having casual conversations about colonialism, different philosophies of black activism and self-identity, and had not realised how puzzling or threatening this might be to some readers. McGruder, who takes his artistic inspiration from Japanese animators, accepts that the Boondocks will be subject to much more scrutiny than the more conventional new arrivals on the scene and that it will be viewed through the nation's racial prism. He is one of only five syndicated black artists among hundreds of white cartoonists. \"I have a responsibility to the black community to represent us accurately and depict us in both writing and art in a way which black people will be proud of and allow their children to read. It has been really important to me to try and show the beauty of black children artistically, show the intelligence and sophistication of young black kids today. Black people are going to be watching very closely to see if you misrepresent something - and for good reason: they've been horribly misrepresented in the past.\" He feels that the overwhelming response to his creation has been good. \"I would say it's an indicator that while America has a long way to go before it tackles its racial issues, people from all walks of life are ready to start talking about things openly and addressing these taboo issues with candour and honesty.\" He feels the strip has many \"curious onlookers\" who are not quite sure how to take what the characters say. Some of the criticisms, he says, have come from \"whites who simply cannot stand the thought of dealing with black people on our own terms. When we demonstrate true independence of thought and action we are accused of widening the racial gap. It's as if the 'acceptance' of black equality is conditional to our behaving and speaking as much like white people as possible.\" It is the cartoon strip that has brought McGruder recognition - although his website (boondocks.net) claims that he still has \"no BMW, no Benz, not a single item of clothing from Versace\" - but he says he is not wedded to it as a form. A book of the strip will be out later this year and an animated version is already underway and will hit television screens in 2001. But he likes the simplicity and directness of the daily strip. \"It's a great medium because there's so little standing in between myself and the readers.\" And when some papers decide to censor an episode or two, his website provides the missing links for deprived readers and his growing army of fans. The cartoon strip can have a wonderfully subversive effect as followers of underground comic artists such as Robert Crumb and Gilbert Shelton, the creators of Mr Natural and the Furry Freak Brothers, discovered in the 60s and 70s. They and others helped to spawn a new generation of cartoonists both in the United States and Europe who saw the form as a simple way of reaching readers who were resistant to worthy editorialising but responsive to seeing what they could identify with - drugs, sloth, trouble with the law - being reflected on the printed page. McGruder is also reaching an audience that previously may have felt that the funnies were for their parents rather than them and his success has already prompted other young artists to see if they can enter the hallowed gates where BC and Dilbert, Garfield and Citizen Dog roam free. It can still, of course, be a delicate business tiptoeing through the minefields on an unmarked path between what offends and what stimulates. Last year Rutgers university in New Jersey found itself attacked after the campus newspaper had run a strip about a fictional town called Hicksville. One girl in the strip suggests that black people got \"a free ride\" to which another character replies: \"on a slave ship\". The editors, one black, one white, apologised for causing offence. McGruder, whose guiding light is Yoda from Star Wars, is anxious to continue to try and push the boundaries of the form. The rather sterile presidential race currently under way offers plenty of ammunition. Over the past week, the ever-critical Huey has been watching television and discovering that Beavis and Butthead can sometimes provide rather more mature intellectual debate than Gore and Bradley, Bush and McCain. Perhaps, in a small way, nothing better signifies the way the United States may change in the new century than the passing of the comforting beagle and his chums and the arrival of the uncompromising Huey and his.",

      "trailText": "<p>As a decision looms over the vexed issue of BBC funding,  Janine Gibson  reveals that the question of a supplementary fee for digital TV has split the Treasury and Number 10.</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Back in October, a national newspaper devoted much of its front page to the prediction that the BBC's future funding would be secured by a substantial rise in the licence fee - not a supplement paid by digital subscribers. It claimed that a key trade-off for this would be letting the national audit office in to balance the corporation books. </p> <p>Four months on, the stories have run through every conceivable option for the future: a digital licence fee of anything between \u00a36 and \u00a324, a licence fee rise of \u00a312 to \u00a315, a combination of the two. Rest assured that, come decision day, someone will be able to trumpet: \"Ooh, I said that all along.\" The excesses of zeal which have characterised the BBC's bid for increased digital funding and the commercial broadcasters' determined opposition have hit peaks of lobbying meriting the question: \"Have you no shame?\" </p> <p>The interested parties, sensing now the climax to their battle of over a year, can almost laugh, albeit wrily, in recollection. One senior government source still left with a sense of humour intact remembers the moment last November when the BBC said it needed \"\u00a3700m a year and not a penny less . . . That was an extreme bit of lobbying.\" One partic ipant in the bad-tempered meeting at the department of culture, media and sport remembers the BBC executives present \"were like kids talking about what they wanted for Christmas\". </p> <p>The source remembers being amazed by how many people at the BBC appeared to be genuinely surprised when it was pointed out to them with some force that they were damaging their case by refusing to quantify their demands. Others remember a crunch meeting between the DCMS and some commercial broadcasters when, poised for their killer argument, they announced that the introduction of a digital licence fee would prove \"the end of digital television\". \"No one,\" they declared, \"is going to switch over. It'll put the switch off back at least five years.\" </p> <p>It would also, said Sky breathlessly, irrevocably damage Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, smugly convinced they had frightened Chris Smith, the secretary of state, off such a foolhardy plan. According to sources, all Smith was moved to think was: \"Oh, be a bit more rational, please.\" </p> <p>Gavyn Davies, the economist who led the panel charged with determining the best way forward last spring, published his report in August. He delivered a near-unanimous verdict (there was one prescient doubter) that a sliding digital licence fee was the way forward, presenting a case which admiring government officials termed \"intellectually compelling\". Until then, the high stakes campaign had been conducted behind closed doors. It was in the following six months that it was blown wide open. </p> <p>Instantly christened the \"digital poll tax\" - reputedly by BSkyB's then general on the frontline Tim Allan - the supplement has since proved the main focus for the warring factions. Far from being all done and dusted by Christmas, or even by John Birt's departure last month - and great efforts were made to present the departing director-general with a conclusion as a leaving gift - the question of the BBC's funding is far from answered, despite the best efforts of some News International newspapers to settle the matter by devoting three inch headlines to a possible solution. </p> <p>Trouble is no one can agree what the solution is. The talk now is that rifts between Stephen Byers, trade and industry secretary, Gordon Brown's Treasury, Tony Blair's number 10 advisers and Smith himself have caused the delay. Smith and Number 10 are pro digital licence fee, say those who spend a Gormenghast budget to know these things; while Byers and Brown say over their dead bodies. Or it might be the other way round, they concede. Whitehall sources would have it that the manifold distractions of daily government have necessarily taken prominence. At least one broadcasting source last week ventured the opinion that there could be no answer on this question until the troubles in Northern Ireland have been sorted, an awe-inspiring thought, but no one denies that it would have been preferable to get an answer out before Christmas as originally promised. </p> <p>Davies' other, less controversial, conclusions have been quietly accepted, while the spin and counter-spin have been played out. His arguments that BBC Resources and Worldwide should be sold off are now seen as not practicable, but nevertheless valuable pointers to the corporation that it should get its act together. His half-price licence fee for the blind has been all but rubber-stamped.

      "bodyText": "Back in October, a national newspaper devoted much of its front page to the prediction that the BBC's future funding would be secured by a substantial rise in the licence fee - not a supplement paid by digital subscribers. It claimed that a key trade-off for this would be letting the national audit office in to balance the corporation books. Four months on, the stories have run through every conceivable option for the future: a digital licence fee of anything between \u00a36 and \u00a324, a licence fee rise of \u00a312 to \u00a315, a combination of the two. Rest assured that, come decision day, someone will be able to trumpet: \"Ooh, I said that all along.\" The excesses of zeal which have characterised the BBC's bid for increased digital funding and the commercial broadcasters' determined opposition have hit peaks of lobbying meriting the question: \"Have you no shame?\" The interested parties, sensing now the climax to their battle of over a year, can almost laugh, albeit wrily, in recollection. One senior government source still left with a sense of humour intact remembers the moment last November when the BBC said it needed \"\u00a3700m a year and not a penny less . . . That was an extreme bit of lobbying.\" One partic ipant in the bad-tempered meeting at the department of culture, media and sport remembers the BBC executives present \"were like kids talking about what they wanted for Christmas\". The source remembers being amazed by how many people at the BBC appeared to be genuinely surprised when it was pointed out to them with some force that they were damaging their case by refusing to quantify their demands. Others remember a crunch meeting between the DCMS and some commercial broadcasters when, poised for their killer argument, they announced that the introduction of a digital licence fee would prove \"the end of digital television\". \"No one,\" they declared, \"is going to switch over. It'll put the switch off back at least five years.\" It would also, said Sky breathlessly, irrevocably damage Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, smugly convinced they had frightened Chris Smith, the secretary of state, off such a foolhardy plan. According to sources, all Smith was moved to think was: \"Oh, be a bit more rational, please.\" Gavyn Davies, the economist who led the panel charged with determining the best way forward last spring, published his report in August. He delivered a near-unanimous verdict (there was one prescient doubter) that a sliding digital licence fee was the way forward, presenting a case which admiring government officials termed \"intellectually compelling\". Until then, the high stakes campaign had been conducted behind closed doors. It was in the following six months that it was blown wide open. Instantly christened the \"digital poll tax\" - reputedly by BSkyB's then general on the frontline Tim Allan - the supplement has since proved the main focus for the warring factions. Far from being all done and dusted by Christmas, or even by John Birt's departure last month - and great efforts were made to present the departing director-general with a conclusion as a leaving gift - the question of the BBC's funding is far from answered, despite the best efforts of some News International newspapers to settle the matter by devoting three inch headlines to a possible solution. Trouble is no one can agree what the solution is. The talk now is that rifts between Stephen Byers, trade and industry secretary, Gordon Brown's Treasury, Tony Blair's number 10 advisers and Smith himself have caused the delay. Smith and Number 10 are pro digital licence fee, say those who spend a Gormenghast budget to know these things; while Byers and Brown say over their dead bodies. Or it might be the other way round, they concede. Whitehall sources would have it that the manifold distractions of daily government have necessarily taken prominence. At least one broadcasting source last week ventured the opinion that there could be no answer on this question until the troubles in Northern Ireland have been sorted, an awe-inspiring thought, but no one denies that it would have been preferable to get an answer out before Christmas as originally promised. Davies' other, less controversial, conclusions have been quietly accepted, while the spin and counter-spin have been played out. His arguments that BBC Resources and Worldwide should be sold off are now seen as not practicable, but nevertheless valuable pointers to the corporation that it should get its act together. His half-price licence fee for the blind has been all but rubber-stamped. Crucially, his recommendations regarding external regulation of the BBC via the national audit office and the consequent removal of ultimate power from the governors is seen as one of the main planks of the government's trade-off with the corporation. You will get more money; you will have to demonstrate better how you spend it. It is the key area on which all agree. The BBC has done itself no favours in its handling of the economics.

Mr Blair and home secretary Jack Straw were visiting Newham council where innovative use of close-circuit TV cameras has helped drive down crimes such as shoplifting, mugging and vandalism. The ministers welcomed the council's use of hi-tech cameras which are able to recognise the faces of known criminals as they walk through the borough's shopping centres. Across the country the home office hopes to see vehicle crime fall by 30% over five years from 1998/99 figures. Domestic burglaries are hoped to fall by 26%. The five forces with the highest robbery rates have been told to reduce them by 10% in Greater Manchester and Merseyside, 15% in the Metropolitan Police area, 34% in West Midlands and 22% in West Yorkshire. Launching the initiative, home secretary Jack Straw compared the setting of targets and publishing of new league tables for police performance with league tables published by schools which had helped local people monitor the performance of their public services. Targets for individual forces range from 10% to 64%. He said: \"For the first time there will be a meaningful target regime which police forces themselves will own, driving up morale and performance. \"And for the first time people will be able to measure the success of the fight against crime in their own back yard.\" Inner city police forces have also been set targets to reduce the number of muggings by up to 34% within the next five years. The targets published today were drawn up in consultation with police forces which will be able to amend them before they are finalised at the end of next month. Sir John Evans, president of the association of chief police officers, said forces had drawn up their targets on the basis that they would receive enough money and officers to fund their operations properly. He warned that the enormous over-application for funds freed up by the home office to recruit 5,000 new officers could cause difficulties in meeting the targets for forces which were relying on extra manpower. He also warned that fighting crime was a partnership and that other agencies, such as local authorities, should be accountable for meeting the targets.",

      "bodyText": "\u0095 Just to increase the teen frenzy that has greeted Leonardo DiCaprio ever since he arrived for Berlin Film Festival on Friday, BZ - a German tabloid newspaper - has offered a thousand marks (just over \u00a3300) to the first Berlin girl who delivers photographic evidence of her kissing the baby-faced star. The news should please the star: at every press conference for The Beach he has lamented that he has no control over his image. \u0095 Kira Muratova has won the first ever Andrzej Wajda Freedom Prize at the Berlin Film Festival. The director himself presented the $10,000 prize to the Russian producer for her work and her \"commitment to truth\" during the Soviet era. Many of her films were banned by the Soviet Union, and some were not shown for up to 17 years. Muratova, winner of Berlin's Golden Bear film award in 1990, said the award would be a useful injection of funds for her film business. A Letter to America, her 20-minute short designed as an ironic message from suffering intellectuals in Odessa to their friends who have managed to emigrate to the United States, is being screened at this year's festival. \u0095 What with losing his New Zealand army cavaliers to East Timor, seeing his set being swept away during freak floods, and having to give lead actor Stuart Townsend the big heave-ho, things haven't been going all that smoothly for Lord of the Rings director, Peter Jackson. The next upset according to TheOneRing.Net is that Uma Thurman will not be cast as the female warrior, Eowyn, in the first instalment of the trilogy. There is no word yet as to why she left the part, or who her replacement will be. \u0095 Jennifer Aniston is the favourite to play Spiderman's gal pal, Mary Jane, in the forthcoming Spiderman film, according to SpidermanHype.Com. The producers are said to be attracted to Brad Pitt's squeeze because she's a household name, but is cheaper to hire than a number of other actresses and, most importantly for any superhero, she's quite short. \u0095 Don't expect any under-age shenanigans with high school cheerleaders from Kevin Spacey's new film, Pay it Forward. Governors has just given permission for the film, about a 12-year-old boy's desire to make the world a better place, to be shot at an LA school on one condition: that the film is rated lower than an R. Casting couch \u0095 Director Jon Amiel is to take Thomas Hardy's Far From The Madding Crowd and turn it into a western called North of Cheyenne. Set in Wyoming, not Wessex, the film will focus on a headstrong woman who is loved by a number of men. No cast is attached as yet, and Amiel's commitment would be subject to his approval of the casting. \u0095 Girl, Interrupted scribe James Mangold is to write and co-direct a biopic about the tumultuous life of singer Johnny Cash.",

He showed excellent leadership and had a strong grasp of the game as a whole. He went into administration later on, and proved a great influence. 2 Sir Garry Sobers A skilful and intelligent bowler and a player able to cope with all the facets of batting. His mere presence in a team daunted opponents. He was a fine character, unselfish and a true sportsman. 3 Viv Richards A fearless, dominating cricketer - certainly on a footing with Bradman and Sobers. He was always able to make the runs when needed, and did things his way. He displayed the same qualities as a captain and rejected the wearing of helmets. 4 Ian Botham He was always daring and aggressive and was the leading allrounder of his time.

If you listen to the Americans, they will crank it up a notch or two. \"She is one of the greatest players in the world,\" says Marie Wozniak, who runs public relations for Seton Hall University, Smith's New Jersey home for the past three years. When you do decipher the statistics, you get confirmation. Smith's points-per-game average is a college all-time record, as is her goals-per-game average of 1.49. The rate is not far off Dixie Dean's English record of 60 goals in 39 matches (1.53), far and away above anything anyone has ever achieved in the Premiership. </p> <p>On February 1 Seton Hall paid her their highest possible compliment by retiring her number, six.

Being so young, with all those women closing in on the ball and pushing me off the ball, I think that's where I got my strength.\" </p> <p>Smith continued to bridge the age gap, moving into senior football with Arsenal and earning her first international cap at only 16. The goals were soon forthcoming for England: Smith scored four times in the European championship qualifying matches in 1995 and 1996, but the goals were to no avail. England did not qualify for the finals - a familiar story. </p> <p>Smith's next season in English football would be her last for a while. She was talent spotted at the Watford football festival. </p> <p>\"This guy was recruiting for American Universities and thought I was a really good player. My dad gave him our phone number and I got calls within a week or so.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In her first book, The Bluest Eye, novelist Toni Morrison identifies the idea of romantic love as one \"of the most destructive ideas in the history of human thought\". Its destructiveness resides in the notion that we come to love with no will and no capacity to choose. This illusion, perpetuated by so much romantic lore, stands in the way of our learning how to love. To sustain our fantasy, we substitute romance for love. </p> <p>When romance is depicted as a project, or so the mass media would have us believe, women are the architects and the planners. Everyone likes to imagine that women are romantics, sentimental about love, that men follow where women lead. Even in non-heterosexual relationships, the paradigms of leader and follower often prevail, with one person assuming the role deemed feminine and another the designated masculine role. </p> <p>No doubt it was someone playing the role of leader who conjured up the notion that we \"fall in love\", that we lack choice and decision when choosing a partner because when the chemistry is present, when the click is there, it just happens - it overwhelms - it takes control. This way of thinking about love seems to be especially useful for men who are socialised to be out of touch with what they feel. </p> <p>In the essay Love and Need, Thomas Merton contends: \"The expression to 'fall in love' reflects a peculiar attitude towards love and life itself - a mixture of fear, awe, fascination and confusion. It implies suspicion, doubt, hesitation in the presence of something unavoidable, yet not fully reliable.\" If you do not know what you feel, then it is difficult to choose love; it is better to fail. Then you do not have to be responsible for your actions. </p> <p>Erotic attraction often serves as the catalyst for an intimate connection between two people, but it is not a sign of love. Exciting, pleasurable sex can take place between two people who do not even know each other. Yet the vast majority of males in our society are convinced that their erotic longing indicates who they should, and can, love. Seduced by erotic desire, they often end up in relationships with partners with whom they share no common interests or values. </p> <p>Women rarely choose men solely on the basis of erotic connection. While most females acknowledge the importance of sexual pleasure, they recognise that it is not the only ingredient needed to build strong relationships. The sexism of stereotyping women as care-givers did make it acceptable for women to articulate emotional needs. Women who have only named their erotic hunger in the wake of the permission given by the feminist movement have always been able to speak their hunger for love. </p> <p>But this does not mean that we find the love we long for. Shared sexual passion can be a sustaining and binding force in a troubled relationship, but it is not the proving ground for love. </p> <p>Even though sex matters, most of us are no more able to articulate sexual needs and longing than we are able to speak our desire for love. Ironically, the presence of life-threatening sexually transmitted diseases has become the reason more couples communicate with each other about erotic behaviour. Where once knowing nothing was the basis for excitement and erotic intensity, knowing more is now the basis. </p> <p>Cultural acceptance of this shift shows that we are all capable of changing our attitudes about \"falling in love\". We can acknowledge the \"click\" we feel when we meet someone new as just that - a mysterious sense of connection that may or may not have anything to do with love. How different things might be if, rather than saying \"I am in love\" we said \"I am loving\" or \"I will love\". Our patterns around romantic love are unlikely to change if we do not change our language. </p> <p>I have learned over the years that we may meet a true love and that our lives may be transformed by such an encounter even when it does not lead to sexual pleasure, committed bonding or even sustained contact. The myth of true love - that fairytale vision of two souls who meet, join and live happily thereafter - is the stuff of childhood fantasy. True love does not always lead to happily ever after and even when it does, sustaining love still takes work. </p> <p>Usually we imagine that true love will be intensely pleasurable and romantic, full of love and light. In fact, true love is all about work. The poet Rainer Maria Rilke wisely observed: \"Like so much else, people have also misunderstood the place of love in life, they have made it into play and pleasure because they thought that play and pleasure was more blissful than work; but there is nothing happier than work, and love, just because it is the extreme happiness, can be nothing else but work.\" </p> <p> The essence of true love is mutual recognition - two individuals seeing each other as they really are. We all know that the usual approach is to meet someone we like and put our best self forward, or even at times a false self, one we believe will be more appealing to the person we want to attract. When our real self appears in its entirety, when the good behaviour becomes too much to maintain or the masks are taken away, disappointment comes. All too often, individuals feel, after the fact - when feelings are hurt and hearts are broken - that it was a case of mistaken identity, that the loved one is a stranger. They saw what they wanted to see rather than what was really there. </p> <p>True love is a different story. When it happens, individuals usually feel in touch with each other's core identity. Embarking on such a relationship is frightening precisely because we feel there is no place to hide. We are known. </p> <p>The heartbeat of true love is the willingness to reflect on one's actions and to process and communicate this reflection with the loved one. Honesty and openness is always the foundation of insightful dialogue. Most of us have not been raised in homes where we have seen two deeply loving grown folks talking together. We do not see this on television or at the movies. And how can any of us communicate with men who have been told all their lives that they should not express what they feel? Men who want to love and do not know how must first learn to let their hearts speak. Choosing to be fully honest, to reveal ourselves, is risky. The experience of true love gives us the courage to risk. </p> <p>As long as we are afraid to risk, we cannot know love. Hence the truism: \"Love is letting go of fear.\" Our hearts connect with lots of folks in a lifetime but most of us will go to our graves with no experience of true love. This is in no way tragic, as most of us run the other way when true love comes near. Since true love sheds light on those aspects of ourselves we may wish to deny or hide, enabling us to see ourselves clearly and without shame, it is not surprising that so many individuals who say they want to know love turn away when such love beckons. </p> <p>No matter how often we turn our minds and hearts away - or how stubbornly we refuse to believe in its magic - true love exists. Everyone wants it, even those who claim to have given up hope. But not everyone is ready. True love appears only when our hearts are ready. </p> <p>Not everyone can bear the weight of true love. Wounded hearts turn away from love because they do not want to do the work of healing necessary to sustain and nurture love. </p> <p> When one knows a true love, the transformative force of that love lasts even when we no longer have the company of that person with whom we experienced profound mutual care and growth. Thomas Merton writes: \"We discover our true selves in love.\" Many of us are not ready to accept and embrace our true selves, particularly when living with integrity alienates us from our familiar worlds. Often, when we undergo a process of self-recovery, for a time we may find ourselves more alone. Writing about choosing solitude over company that does not nurture one's soul, Maya Angelou reminds us: \"It is never lonesome in Babylon.\" Fear of facing true love may actually lead some individuals to remain in situations of lack and unfulfilment. There they are not alone, they are not at risk. </p> <p>To love fully and deeply puts us at risk. When we love, we are changed utterly. Merton asserts: \"Love affects more than our thinking and our behaviour towards those we love. It transforms our entire life. Genuine love is a personal revolution. Love takes your ideas, your desires and your actions, and welds them together in one experience and one living reality which is a new you.\" </p> <p>Love within the context of romantic bonding offers us the unique chance to be transformed in a welcoming celebratory atmosphere. Without \"falling in love\", we can recognise that moment of mysterious connection between our soul and that of another person as love's attempt to call us back to our true selves. </p> <p>Intensely connecting with another soul, we are made bold and courageous. Using that fearless will to bond and connect as a catalyst for choosing and committing ourselves to love, we are able to love ruly and deeply, to give and receive a love that lasts, a love that is \"stronger than death\".</p>",

He also played in nine one-day internationals (9 ct, 2 st). He was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1995.</em></p> <p> \"I've been working on the commercial side for Worcestershire, answering questions from journalists and helping to promote the club. It is something which I would consider going into after my career as a cricketer ends. </p> <p>I have also been coaching a lot, including the cricket team at Bradford University. After the season ended in September, I went on a cricket tour to Barbados, which was brilliant. The previous month I'd taken my wife and three kids to Disney World in Florida. It was amazing. I needed to relax after the season.</p> <p>I started training for next season as soon as the last one ended. I've had a few niggling injuries but nothing too serious. Officially, Worcestershire do not start training until March 25, although we did have a session in the nets last Monday, so I'll be fit and raring to go by next season.</p> <p>I haven't seen any of the Worcestershire guys over the break. I do see them socially during the season but from the end of March to the end of September you live in each other's pockets, so it is nice to have a break. The winter is when most cricketers want to spend time with their families, and that is just what I did.</p> <p>I had a very family-orientated Christmas and New Year.

      "bodyText": "Steven Rhodes, 35, the Worcestershire wicketkeeper, played for England in 11 Tests , taking 46 catches and three stumpings. He also played in nine one-day internationals (9 ct, 2 st). He was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1995. \"I've been working on the commercial side for Worcestershire, answering questions from journalists and helping to promote the club. It is something which I would consider going into after my career as a cricketer ends. I have also been coaching a lot, including the cricket team at Bradford University. After the season ended in September, I went on a cricket tour to Barbados, which was brilliant. The previous month I'd taken my wife and three kids to Disney World in Florida. It was amazing. I needed to relax after the season. I started training for next season as soon as the last one ended. I've had a few niggling injuries but nothing too serious. Officially, Worcestershire do not start training until March 25, although we did have a session in the nets last Monday, so I'll be fit and raring to go by next season. I haven't seen any of the Worcestershire guys over the break. I do see them socially during the season but from the end of March to the end of September you live in each other's pockets, so it is nice to have a break. The winter is when most cricketers want to spend time with their families, and that is just what I did. I had a very family-orientated Christmas and New Year. For the millennium, we went out with five other families and started with a good pub lunch, you know, the full works - starter, main course and pudding. We then all came back to my house to see in Year 2000. I've been watching England in South Africa too. I listen to it on the radio mostly. It's a shame they haven't got the desired results.

To encourage this, education needs to leave behind organisational models inherited from the nineteenth century. The main response to demand for more investment in education has been to expand the role of schools and universities, extending the time students spend in these institutions and introducing performance targets to drive the system to higher levels of productivity. </p> <p>This process of modernisation through institutional reform started in 1902 with the Balfour Act, which consolidated a national education system in England and Wales. The Butler Act in 1944 enforced participation in secondary education to the age of 14. The Robbins Report in 1963 and subsequent reforms in the 1980s opened higher education beyond an \u008elite. Reforms in the 1990s drew three- and four-year-olds into the net of formal education. As educational institutions have extended their scope, central government has extended its power to set a core curriculum, accompanied by a panoply of targets, tests, restrictions and regulations.</p> <p>This approach to modernisation also reinforces a deeply conservative approach to education, as a body of knowledge imparted by organisations with strong hierarchies and demarcated professional disciplines. As Tom Bentley points out in Learning Beyond the Classroom, two traditions are reflected in this culture: the monasteries, which were closed repositories for knowledge in the form of precious manuscripts, and Taylor's factory, which encouraged standardized, easily replicated knowledge. </p> <p>The result is a system that is a curious hybrid of factory, sanctuary, library and prison. Educational institutions inherited from the industrial age provide a safe and supportive environment for children, but they also seek to control and contain children and standardise the knowledge they acquire. The reforms of the last two decades have intensified these tensions, rather than resolved them or created an education revival in the UK led by the creation of new kinds of learning institutions, tailored for their times.</p> <p>A new educational system is slowly developing, in parallel and outside the traditional state and private school system. This evolving system operates with a different definition of learning and education. It delivers education through quite different mechanisms and funds it from private and public sources. Elements of this system include: the Open University; public investments in the National Grid for Learning and the University for Industry; home schooling, which involves 50,000 children in the UK and many more in the US; a plethora of corporate universities and a burgeoning self-help market involving books, digital television channels and interactive learning programmes. These new educational institutions are demand-led, use information technology as much as libraries and classrooms, and tailor learning to individual needs. They are frequently financed by shared investments between pupils, employers and the state.</p> <p>How can the old and the new educational systems evolve together to mutual benefit? The starting point must be a redefinition of the purpose of education. We must move away from a view of education as a rite of passage involving the acquisition of enough knowledge and qualifications to acquire an adult station in life. The point of education should not be to inculcate a body of knowledge, but to develop capabilities: the basic ones of literacy and numeracy as well as the capability to act responsibly towards others, to take initiative and to work creatively and collaboratively. </p> <p>The most important capability, and one which traditional education is worst at creating, is the ability and yearning to carry on learning. Too much schooling kills off a desire to learn. The traditional institutions of education may be well suited to delivering basic core competencies, such as literacy and numeracy, but they fall down on many other counts: many people are turned off learning because they find school constraining, frustrating and patronizing. The new networked education system is more in tune with these modern goals, but it is designed for people with initiative who can afford to invest in their own learning. It is far from a national, inclusive system.</p> <p>We need hybrid public and private institutions and funding structures. Schools and universities should become more like hubs of learning, within the community, capable of extending into the community. New primary schools, for example, should be set up as family learning centres, catering for adults and children. As far as secondary schools are concerned, we should follow Ivan Illich's inspirational advice thirty years ago to partially de-school society. More learning should be done at home, in offices and kitchens, in the contexts where knowledge is deployed to solve problems and add value to people's lives. </p> <p>With this must go changes in accreditation, to move away from a sole reliance on traditional entry qualifications, such as GCSEs. Instead we should provide people with a portfolio of continuous assessment and records of achievement. British universities have been able to survive in the middle ground between the old and the new economies. They do not fit neatly into either. In some respects universities are models for the new economy, particularly the way they encourage research, experimentation and knowledge-creation by autonomous, self-managing researchers and knowledge workers. Yet universities are hardly freewheeling, entrepreneurial places and academic communities are riven by professional, doctrinal and disciplinary disputes and demarcation lines which few outsiders can understand. Moreover, universities have their own protocols, hierarchies and procedures - especially the older universities - which make them slow-moving and resistant to change. </p> <p>In short, universities have cultures which seem to borrow from the library, the monastery, the gentleman's club and the laboratory but not the factory. British universities were able to survive as mutant-hybrids only so long as there was a social contract supporting them. For most of this century they have served only a niche market: the elite 5 per cent of the population. That meant that universities could be funded by taxation, which in turn meant that academics did not face rigorous market pressures to improve their performance. The academic community had its own social contract. High-flyers did not mind the poor pay and teaching load as long as they had the freedom to get on with their research. They did not worry that the poor performers among their colleagues were holding them back.</p> <p>That social contract and everything that goes with it is falling apart. The proportion of the population going through universities has gone up to 35 per cent - one of the main achievements of Thatcherism was to drive the expansion of higher-education - and almost certainly will touch 50 per cent in the next two decades. Demand for expansion, combined with growing state regulation to improve performance, is driving many universities to become mass-production degree machines. Meanwhile, elite institutions with international brand names are pulling away from the mass-production university designed to churn out the basic, commodity first degree. </p> <p>The same process of fragmentation is at work within the academic workforce. Top researchers and academic superstars are increasingly in an international market for their talent; academic scientists can often work in the private sector. These superstar academics can bid up their salaries, terms and conditions. They operate in a quite different world from the mainstream, middle-ranking workforce, which is employed to do the basic teaching. And the top and the middle are far less tolerant of the underperformance of the worst academics who pull down the institution's rankings in research and teaching assessments.</p> <p>Add to all this the growth of new technologies to deliver learning and corporate universities, which will soon take students from outside their own companies, and it is easy to see why the cosy old order is falling apart. Universities and academics will become increasingly segmented. The elite will be involved in the 'knowledge-creation' business of research and experimentation; the mass will be involved in the 'knowledge-management' business of delivering degree modules. This segmentation means that the funding, organisation; ownership, management and pay systems of universities will all become far more diverse.</p> <p>It is not hard to set how far and how quickly this could go. Imagine that Rupert Murdoch were to set up the News International University, serving initially only his employees. After a while he might open up entry to the university to readers of his newspapers and viewers of his television programmes. News International University might grow very fast as one of the world's first truly global learning institutions. Armed with Murdoch's money, the university would acquire some star names as teachers. After ten years of development Murdoch might then decide the time was ripe to add some brand quality to his commodity business: he might bid for Oxford, or the London School of Economics.</p> <p> By that stage, of course, public funding for universities would be tightly constrained, tuition fees would be a fact of life and universities would be familiar with competing in a market. In those circumstances a lucrative offer from Murdoch will seem quite attractive. He might offer to pump billions of dollars into research and development, recruiting top stars from around the world. How many billion pounds would an international brand name like Oxford University or the London School of Economics be worth? Who would own the brand: the taxpayer, the academics? The accountants working for the vice-chancellors had better get cracking. Expanding university education should not be the Holy Grail. Bill Gates was a college drop-out. As the supply of graduates expands, the value of a college degree, on its own, will decline. </p> <p>Copyright \u00a9 Charles Leadbeater, 1999, 2000</p>",

This was confirmed as I sat in a state of nervous collapse after Chris Read's heroic efforts against South Africa the other week - a game England had all but won, then all but lost and came agonisingly close to winning before finally losing. And people say cricket is boring. </p> <p>The passion cricket-lovers have for the game is legendary. I was in Barbados when West Indies were in the process of losing 5-0 in South Africa. Driving through a rural part of the island, we stopped for a drink at a roadside bar. From inside came such shouting and general mayhem that you'd have thought war had broken out. We asked a guy sitting outside what it was all about. He grinned and said, \"Cricket\". </p> <p>Inside, a tiny man in a bright-red shirt was leaping up and down screaming \"Lara never makes any runs! Hooper never makes any runs! West Indies are finished!\" Everyone else was trying to shout him down and, on the verge of spontaneous combustion, he left, still yelling. &lt;P</p> <p>\"It's always the same,\" the barman said , \"win, lose or draw - he goes crazy.\" But that's what cricket does to you.</p> <p>During the Ashes tour last winter my flatmate, getting up to go to work, would find me, half-crazy from lack of sleep, staring intently at the TV and muttering a mixture of curses and encouragement at 11 men on the other side of the world. I become absurdly superstitious, believing that if I go and make a cup of tea then a wicket will fall - although usually by the time the milk is in and I've sat down again, Steve Waugh has calmly moved on to another century.</p> <p>But this eternal optimism is a vital part of the game, because, as we all know, in cricket anything is possible. I sat transfixed by that amazing Test match in Barbados where, with Australia apparently in complete control, Brian Lara defied his critics and played one of the innings of his life to give his team an astonishing victory. That game encapsulated the beauty of cricket. Not just because of the enormous turnaround in fortunes but because of the adrenalin-charged confrontation between Lara and Glenn McGrath.</p> <p>These individual duels between players are part of the fabric of the game, whether it's Lara v McGrath, Mike Atherton v Allan Donald or Sachin Tendulkar v Shane Warne. It's not just about the result - we're intrigued by players' personal strengths and weaknesses. At The Oval last summer Phil Tufnell got a huge cheer from the crowd when he came to field on the boundary - even though he'd been clattered all around the ground by Chris Cairns - because he's just one of those players supporters love, flaws and all, in the same way we love Darren Gough's ebullience and Atherton's gritty determination.</p> <p>It's as if cricket is one giant soap opera and we're all waiting for the next episode. When will the brash, tough, all-conquering Australians cease to be all-conquering? Will the mercurial West Indies rise again? Why do the oh-so-efficient South Africans suddenly fall to pieces out of nowhere? And what about England? Eternally unpredictable England, who can veer between brilliance and incompetence, sometimes in one afternoon.</p> <p>However, one thing is certain - next summer, when Curtly and Courtney are charging in at Athers and his opening partner, I shall be there, fingers crossed, wanting England to win. And anyone who's driving past that bar in Barbados will probably see a little man in a red shirt leaping up and down, simply because like me and so many others he's mad about cricket.</p>",

But the tide is coming in fast, and when the water recedes what will have been washed away and what will have been dumped on the new shoreline? Will viewers flock to see it or will they complain bitterly that the golden age of television is long gone?</p> <p> Digital is unifying the way we use equipment to get information, process it and be entertained. It's a bit like our political landscape - New Labour adopts Conservative policies, the Conservatives adopt New Labour policies and they both end up talking the same language.</p> <p> Computers are getting more like televisions by bringing us audio and video content. Televisions are getting more like computers by bringing us e-mail and the internet. However, the look and feel of TV and computers is very different, reflecting the needs of desktop versus lounge, lean-forward technology (computer) versus lean-back (television).</p> <p> Open, the interactive TV service that comes with Sky Digital, brings us home shopping, e-mail and some simple games. But, interestingly, there appears to be a brick wall built between Sky's programming and Open's content. So, thus far, I have not found any interactive adverts on Sky prompting me to buy something from one of Open's retailers.</p> <p> So we may have the new technology, but the broadcasters are far from sure what to do with it. In fact some of them find it positively scary, and probably with good reason as they see the balance of power shifting away from the likes of the BBC and Carlton.</p> <p> Smaller, more nimble companies can overturn the traditional model of broadcasting. Take FutureTV, a company we (Mondex International) have just done a smartcard deal with. Viewers using FutureTV technology can now choose what programmes they want to watch and when they want to watch them. Using a smartcard with e-cash, such as Mondex, you pay solely for the programmes you watch - 50p here, click, 50p there, click. And just as Amazon knows what you like to read and listen to, your television knows what you like to watch, and can suggest programmes you might want to see.</p> <p> So broadcasters are faced with two terrible challenges: the \"unbundling\" of content (in fact the death of television channels like Channel 4 or BBC1, which schedule the programmes they think you might like to see) and the growth of \"pay-as-you-go\".</p> <p> Why are these terrible? Simply because they threaten the power and the revenue patterns that broadcasters have grown used to. To date, the power of the broadcasters has been based on ownership and control of content, and ownership of the audience.</p> <p> But, of course, unbundling and pay-as-you-go are both inevitable - inevitable because they have a powerful appeal to consumers. Today, more mobile phones are sold on a pay-as-you-go basis than on subscription. Recent research by NOP shows that 57% of people would prefer to pay for TV on a pay-as-you-use basis. And look at how the music industry is being turned upside down by our ability to go to a website and download MP3 music tracks or get custom CDs made. All of these things are surely strong pointers to the future of television content.</p> <p> However, amid all this fear, there is a massive opportunity. In the long run, there is no point trying to fight the consumer, and if a company does not give its consumers what they really want, a competitor or a new entrant will. Addressing fundamental consumer needs is the fastest route to greater market share and increased capitalisation, and as the tie up of AOL with Time Warner and EMI shows, some will \"get it\" and some won't.</p> <p> New ways of accessing and paying for TV programming is only the start of the revolution. The nature of programming will change and, equally important, we will also have the opportunity to interact far more with our TV. Audience participation could mean playing the quiz show at home or voting on the plot direction of your favourite soap, although in experiments many viewers considered the latter just too wacky. Sky Digital already gives the viewer a chance to choose a particular camera angle when watching football, a concept capable of extension to other formats. It could certainly heighten the drama in programmes such as Casualty - just click here for more blood. More likely we will watch the news headlines and then choose which new items to view rather than following the running order of the news programme. So if you are fed up with watching depressing news, simply go for a diet of feel-good stories. </p> <p> TV news will therefore become much more like internet news, where news is packaged by a whole new breed of \"aggregators\". Football news, company news, currency news, celebrity news, shopping news, technology news, in fact an explosion of news for special interest groups.</p> <p> Viewers will have access to far more news items and more targeted, in-depth coverage, if they want it. The BBC and CNN will no doubt struggle to maintain their position against the new entrants in this new world.</p> <p> Advertising will also have to move on. Broadcast advertising is pretty much a scatter-gun approach. By linking adverts to channels and programmes, you can point the gun in the right direction, but nobody knows what will actually get hit. </p> <p> In the future we will be able to target adverts to individuals and, by giving the viewer a chance to respond instantly, the effectiveness of the advert can be assessed more accurately.</p> <p> Although this sounds like good news for the advertisers, the bad news is that they will need to be more clever in order to persuade us to watch the advert in the first place.</p> <p> One way will be to embody advertising directly within programmes, rather than between programmes. In the US, Princetown Video works with broadcasters to \"paint in\" sponsors' logos and messages within programming as it is delivered. These are not simple captions overlaid on the screen - in football, for example, the messages appear to be painted on the grass of the field. The advantage of doing this digitally is that messages can be tailored to particular viewer segments. Of course, to move \"in programme\" advertising beyond sport will mean pushing the boundaries of the regulatory envelope.</p> <p> Will all this mean that Big Brother will now be sitting in our once friendly television set, building up a precise picture of who we are and everything we do? I think not. In fact, I believe that corporate owners of personal data are in for a big shock because power is going to be placed in the consumer's hands.</p> <p> The security built in to smartcard technology will enable consumers to protect their own personal data. I will be able to build my own personal database of my purchases, my shopping behaviour and preferences. This will be a much more complete and accurate database than any that could be built by a single retailer that I interact with, and therefore it will be more valuable.

A Kampuchean Air Tristar bound for Kandahar, chartered by the International Organisation for Migration, departed from RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire, where it has been on standby since Friday morning, at 12.50am today. The number of Afghanis flying home was much higher than had been expected. But home office officials stressed that the process was \"fluid\", with hostages changing their minds about staying when they realised the implications of applying for asylum. As they prepared for departure, a foreign office spokesman said talks had been held about the future of the 73 other passengers, all of whom are expected to apply formally for asylum today. \"We are in touch with a number of countries, Pakistan and others, in case passengers show an interest in going there.\" Among factors to be taken into consideration would be whether they had relatives in those other countries. Nineteen men are expected to appear before magistrates at Southend today charged with offences under the prevention of terrorism act and international hijack law. Yesterday three men arrested at the end of the hijack last Thursday were released without charge. The foreign office spokesman stressed that, contrary to reports yesterday, there were no ministerial-level negotiations with Pakistan. But a Whitehall source confirmed that though ministers were not involved, discussions were taking place between diplomats. Neither the foreign office nor home office ruled out the possibility of expenses being paid to countries prepared to take the Afghans, but a home office source said talks were at too early a stage to have reached detailed negotiations. \"The issue of money would be subject to discussions with third countries that might be willing to take people,\" the source said. The foreign office was last night trying to establish which of the asylum seekers would be willing to go to third countries. In addition to Pakistan, Britain was in contact with Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, India, Russia and the US. Ministers believe that those Afghan passengers who do claim asylum in the UK have little chance of having their application accepted. The home secretary, Jack Straw, made it clear yesterday that he is to press for international reform of the rules under which the Afghan hostages have claimed refuge in Britain. He will urge ministers from other countries to redefine the 1951 convention, arguing that the law was never designed to cope with the various types of refugee seeking shelter in Britain and Europe. Speaking on BBC1's On the Record yesterday, Mr Straw denied he had spoiled any chance the Afghans had of getting a fair hearing when he said last week he wanted as many as possible removed from Britain. \"We have a great sympathy with those who have a genuine and well founded fear of persecution,\" he said. \"On the other hand we cannot possibly be in a circumstance where it appears we are encouraging international terrorist crime.\" The remaining hostages spent a second night at the fire service college in Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire, following interviews by immigration officials. The four crew members who escaped from the plane are understood to be staying elsewhere in the area.",

His comic strip creation, Peanuts, a catch-all title for a group of knee-high kids in a world no taller than their heads (one of the secrets of the strip's success was that adults were only apparent in the odd off-panel speech balloon), never changed beyond a certain shakiness of line, after it made its debut in American newspapers on October 2, 1950.</p> <p>Although only eight mid-western newspapers printed the strip, today over 90m people read Peanuts world-wide. Originally, Schulz was paid $3 for each daily strip he drew; a recent estimate paid him $1m a month. And then there was the merchandising.</p> <p>Charles Monroe Schulz was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota. His father was a small-time barber. Two days after the boy's birth he nicknamed him Sparky, after Sparkplug, the hapless horse owned by Barney Google, the popular comic strip hero drawn by Billy de Beck. It seems like a twist on an old fairy story, for the baby would be involved with comics for the rest of his life.</p> <p>On his first day at kindergarten, the teacher gave the class sheets of white paper and big crayons, and told them to draw anything they liked. Young Charlie drew a snow scene, then added a palm tree in the background: an unlikely combination, commented on by the teacher, which made the picture stick in the boy's memory, an early illustration of the humorous way his creativity would grow.</p> <p>When he was 11, the first comic books began publication in the US. Already a devotee of the coloured comic supplements to his father's newspapers, Sparky (as he was now signing all his sketches), began to buy and study each new issue. As with most other beginners in the comic strip trade, he learned to cartoon by copying other cartoonists, filling his drawing books with careful versions of every character he enjoyed, from Popeye the Sailor to Buck Rogers.</p> <p>Schulz published his first drawing when he was 14. His pet dog Spike, a mongrel with a touch of hunting hound, had a predilection for eating certain unlikely objects, such as pins and razor blades. He sketched Spike and sent the results to the world-famous Robert Ripley, whose Believe It Or Not panels had world circulation. The picture was signed \"Sparky\" and Ripley reproduced it. The spotted dog bears a certain resemblance to a beagle called Snoopy, co-star of the Peanuts strip.</p> <p>Schulz's first publication seemed likely to become his only one. At high school he was asked to contribute caricatures to his senior year book. He drew them eagerly but the editor refused to publish them. Meanwhile his father paid for a course in cartooning by correspondence with the Art Instruction School of Minneapolis. It cost him $170 in subscriptions, but was ultimately worthwhile. Schulz would eventually join the staff, but not until after his war service.</p> <p>Called into the US Army in February 1943, Schulz would be discharged in the rank of staff sergeant. Although he spent most of his service time in Kentucky guarding trucks, he was sent to France two years later, where he drew his everyday adventures in a pocket sketchbook. Returning home, he joined Art Instruction, correcting the homework sent in by students.</p> <p>He worked under Frank Wing, a perfectionist who was the first man to spot the potential in the cartoons Schulz sketched in his spare moments. Wing persuaded Schulz to submit them to the local newspaper, the Saint Paul Pioneer Press. Although they may not have been aware of it, since the series was called Li'l Folks, local readers were the first to see Peanuts in print. For a while Schulz was delighted enough just to see his drawings appearing regularly, but when the time came for him to ask for an increase in recompense, the editor promptly dropped the feature.</p> <p>Schulz, however, continued to make up his income by let tering the pages of strips in a locally published series of Catholic comic books, Timeless Topix. He also submitted cartoons to the national weekly, Saturday Evening Post, which bought 15 of them before cancelling out. All the cartoons pointed to the shape of strips to come: they all featured little kids with big rounded heads, and not a grown-up in sight.</p> <p>It was 1950 when at last fortune smiled in the shape of the United Feature Syndicate. Schulz had sent them a batch of sample strips. They signed him and sent them out to their worldwide customer list. Eight papers responded; all small circulation, but it was a start. A year later Schulz married Joyce Halverson; they divorced in 1972.</p> <p>From the very first strip Charlie Brown - the champion chump, the favourite fall-guy, the (if-you-like) typical real-life American hero - was the star, and the first character to be named. Then one by one came Linus van Pelt, the first kid to own a security blanket (Schulz's own term, now in Webster's Dictionary); his sister Lucy, the sneery little brat; Schroeder who plays perfect Beethoven on his toy piano; scruffy Peppermint Patty; grubby Pigpen and, of course, Snoopy, the dog given to daydreaming he is a first world war flying ace, and his friend, the yellow bouncing bird, Woodstock. Together they were Peanuts, the only thing Schulz disliked about his strip. He'd gone on calling it Li'l Folks, but the syndicate changed it.</p> <p>Schulz's first acknowledgement came from his fellow newspaper cartoonists: they gave him their Reuben Award in 1955, the first of many honours including, in 1978, being voted by his peers across the world of cartoonists as international cartoonist of the year. Peanuts made the cover of Time Magazine in 1965. The first Peanuts book was published in 1952 (20 years later there were 190 of them); the first of 16 television cartoons was made in 1965; the play You're A Good Man Charlie Brown opened on Broadway in 1967; and the first feature film cartoon was produced in 1969, the year that Charlie Brown and Snoopy went truly out of this world - as mascots of the Command Capsule and Lunar Module of NASA's Apollo 10.</p> <p>Schulz spent much of his time at the Redwood Empire Ice Arena in Santa Rosa, where he played hockey or had coffee at the appropriately named Warm Puppy snack bar. Frequently asked the secret of his characters' appeal, Sparky Schulz would reply: \"If you read the strip regularly you know everything there is about me.\" And as he once confided to the Washington Post: \"My whole life as been one of rejection. Women. Dogs. Comic strips.\" As Charlie Brown was wont to remark: \"Good grief!\"</p> <p>Charles Schulz leaves a wife, Jeannie Forsyth, a daughter and a son.</p>",

Schulz spent much of his time at the Redwood Empire Ice Arena in Santa Rosa, where he played hockey or had coffee at the appropriately named Warm Puppy snack bar. Frequently asked the secret of his characters' appeal, Sparky Schulz would reply: \"If you read the strip regularly you know everything there is about me.\" And as he once confided to the Washington Post: \"My whole life as been one of rejection. Women. Dogs. Comic strips.\" As Charlie Brown was wont to remark: \"Good grief!\" Charles Schulz leaves a wife, Jeannie Forsyth, a daughter and a son.",

      "body": "<p>In the heated debate about whether newspapers - either the actual product or their staff or their strategies - will ever make it on the net, a new set of questions is now being asked. At their simplest they focus on one subject: niche versus generalist. </p> <p>Whereas internet has proved the perfect harbinger of niche interests, serving individuals' peculiar tastes and diverse geographical demands, newspapers and national broadcasters are traditionally great generalists. They often seem ill-at-ease on the internet: able to provide a breadth of information but unwilling to dig down to meet the diverse and specialist demands of their users. </p> <p>As successful online newspapers in the US reach less than 25% of their local internet users, some have tried to add an interest-based niche to their regional focus. The San Jose Mercury is currently devoting much online energy to SiliconValley.com, a specialist site for technology news. They hope to create a vibrant community of loyal users by meeting specialist demands with detailed information. </p> <p>In the UK, OneWorld is one such community. Launched in 1995 to bring international human rights and sustainable development issues to a mass audience, its network of more than 700 partner organisations now gets 2m hits, or page impressions, each month. </p> <p>The site is founded on a different model, using partnerships with experts in non-governmental organisations to provide many of its stories. It has 20 UK employees, staff in seven other countries, and is devolving work to new centres across four continents. </p> <p>\"News sites that used to do their own content are now simply bringing in news from Reuters and PR,\" says OneWorld UK editor Mark Linus. \"I think they have to listen to the concerns of audiences and try and do something different. People are looking round for information that they can believe in.\" </p> <p>\"We do not treat our audience as passive,\" adds OneWorld's publicity manager, Glen Tarman. \"If they want to take action on issues relating to a piece of news we give them avenues to find out more.\" </p> <p>But many other non-commercial UK internet projects have conspicuously failed to create active online citizens or establish the necessary critical mass to become a successful niche news site. While American city sites prosper, the internet offerings based on community projects - such as Brixton Online - slumber, going quietly out-of-date. The talk boards on Islington.org, surely the site of choice for every self-respecting member of the chattering classes, are deafeningly silent. </p> <p>One avowedly commercial site, Fish4, backed by local newspaper publishers in the UK, including Newsquest, Northcliffe, Associated, Trinity and the Manchester Evening News (owned by Guardian Media Group, owners of the Guardian), claims that it has the necessary mass of information to make a niche product. As sales and marketing director Jonathan Lines says: \"Our shareholders own over 800 local and regional newspapers between them. We've got in the region of 200,000 cars, 100,000 homes and 30,000 jobs on our website. We have critical mass.\" </p> <p>It means that the classified information on the site meets people's specific demands, while users can also get niche news from the 103 local news websites linked through the Fish4 network. With 20m page impressions across the network last month and a \u00a320m advertising campaign budget this year, Fish4 hopes to become \"the intuitive place for users to go if they want to find anything in the UK,\" says Lines. </p> <p>BBC News Online is one place where the battle between general and niche is at its most acute. It has a huge breadth of content, both broad-brush and localised. The way it is used demonstrates the diversity of users and their demands. During just one day last week people looked at 98,450 different stories, amounting to a staggering 20% of all the stories the site has ever produced. </p> <p>\"What the user now has is the ability to get more information than ever before and to get it on more platforms than ever before and to get a lower level of detail than ever before,\" says BBC News Online's project manager, Bob Eggington. </p> <p>A news site as big as the BBC can turn itself into a niche site simply with the judicious use of personalisation. Eggington believes that personalisation is a way of shifting the balance of power \"away from the provider and towards the consumer, which from the consumer's point of view must be a good thing\". </p> <p>BBC News Online and the Fish4 network boast a breadth of information. Both recognise the importance of adding depth to this, but neither has yet managed to start serving the diverse niche interests that form at the grassroots. </p> <p>'Rolling out to the lowest level of granularity that resources will permit is clearly a very desirable strategic objective,\" says Eggington. Last October, the BBC launched sections for Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, but plans for 10 further regional niches have been postponed while resources are invested in building a sports site. Eggington hopes to develop the regional news niches \"towards the end of this year . . . We have got local content and we should get it out there.\" </p> <p>By the time the BBC unveils its regional niches, others will be well established. Newsquest has ambitious plans for its 18 local news websites, which are accessible through the Fish4 network. </p> <p>Simon Gray, deputy managing director of Newsquest digital media, says forthcoming new designs will offer \"functionality and lots of very granular community information, real parish pump stuff, from local round table meetings to the local Sunday football league tables\". As well as using local paper copy, Newsquest will also offer new self-build pages for societies, groups and geographical communities to create and edit their own niches within the local news sites. </p> <p>\"The BBC will provide regional news services on the web and they'll do a brilliant job,\" adds Fish4's Jonathan Lines. \"If you watch Newsroom South East you'll get half a dozen stories about the south east. What you won't get is half a dozen stories about Tunbridge Wells. Now we can deliver that. The BBC aren't going to want to provide that, nor are they equipped to do so, but the regional press is.\" </p> <p>By creating such a large aggregate of classified and news information, Fish4 and its subsidiary news websites hope to protect themselves from specialist sites such as Football365, Autotrader or Totaljobs, which will attempt to claim the lion's share of valuable niche advertising revenues. </p> <p>Eggington accepts other sites can beat the BBC on specifics (\"It seems to me likely that CricInfo will always go down to deeper levels of granularity than the BBC sports site\") but says his experience at BBC News Online suggests \"people who have a specialist interest don't take exception to our general site. There is clearly a tension between being general and being specialised,\" he says. \"Our aim is to provide a site that is generally accessible while also being of interest and credible to the specialist.\" </p> <p>The first stage for many news sites in Britain is over. They have ceased to be defensive operations, fearful of cannibalising their offline profits. Through partnerships and expansion of content many have acquired a decent breadth to their news and information online. The next challenge is to seek depth and better satisfy specialist concerns.

      "bodyText": "The government was negotiating with Pakistan yesterday over the price to be paid for providing a home for the Afghan passengers seeking asylum after last week's hijack. As 72 former hostages prepared to return to Afghanistan early today, a foreign office spokesman said talks were taking place about the future of the other passengers. The spokesman said: \"We are in touch with a number of countries, Pakistan and others, in case passengers show an interest in going there.\" Among factors to be taken into consideration would be whether they had relatives in those other countries. Essex police are today expected to charge 19 passengers arrested after the hijack with offences under the prevention of terrorism act and international hijack law. Yesterday three men arrested at the end of the hijack last Thursday were released without charge. The foreign office spokesman stressed that, contrary to reports yesterday, there were no ministerial-level negotiations between Britain and Pakistan about the asylum seekers. But a Whitehall source confirmed discussions were taking place between diplomats. Neither the foreign office nor home office ruled out the possibility of expenses being paid to countries prepared to take the Afghans, but a home office source said talks were at too early a stage to have reached detailed negotiations on terms. \"The issue of money would be subject to discussions with third countries that might be willing to take take people,\" the source said. The foreign office was last night trying to establish which of the asylum seekers would be willing to go to third countries. In addition to Pakistan, Britain was in contact with Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, India, Russia and the US. Ministers believe that those Afghan passengers who do claim asylum in the UK have little chance of having their application accepted. The home secretary Jack Straw, made it clear yesterday that he is to press for international reform of the rules under which the Afghan hostages have claimed refuge in Britain. He will urge ministers from other countries to redefine the 1951 convention, arguing that the law was never designed to cope with the numbers of types of refugee seeking shelter in the UK and Europe. Speaking on BBC1's On the Record yesterday, Mr Straw denied he had spoiled any chance the Afghans had of getting a fair hearing when he said last week that he wanted as many as possible removed from Britain. \"We have a great sympathy with those who have a genuine and well founded fear of persecution,\" he said. \"On the other hand we cannot possibly be in a circumstance where it appears we are encouraging international terrorist crime.\" A Kampuchean airline jet was set to leave RAF Brize Norton early today bound for Kandahar in southern Afghanistan with 72 of the former hostages on board. A home office spokesman said the number expected to leave was greater than had been thought, but that the situation was still \"fluid\". Some 100 of the remaining hostages spent their second evening at the fire service college in Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire, following a fourth day of interviews by immigration officials. The former hostages are being housed in three accommodation blocks at the college, surrounded by a hastily erected 6ft 5in wire mesh fence, and guarded by around 60 Group Four security guards. The four crew members who escaped from the plane are understood to be staying elsewhere in the area.",

      "body": "<p>Computers crash every day. Servers go down. Bandwiths get congested and networks clog. The IT world is as prone to breakdown and gridlock as our transport systems. But something unusual is happening. Since early February there have been a series of strikes on high-profile e-commerce and e-news targets:<a href=\"http://www.yahoo.com/\">Yahoo!</a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/\">Amazon</a>,<a href=\"http://www.buy.com/\">Buy.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ebay.com/\">Ebay</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/\">CNN</a>. </p> <p>The assaults have all followed a pattern - floods of data released by implanted saboteur programs in remote sites. The result, for a few hours, is overload and \"denial of service\": a jam. The raiders were initially assumed to be hackers; pointy-headed kids playing computer games in grown-up places. The authorities were not amused. After the third wave of assaults the raiders were relabelled \"cyber- terrorists\"; up there with Osama Bin Laden. </p> <p>The Justice Department warned of grim penalties: five years and $250,000 for a first offence; 10 years for a second. Attorney general Janet Reno declared: \"We are committed in every way possible to tracking those who are responsible\". Not since the Unabomber have the G-Men seemed so determined to get their man. </p> <p>Who are they? \"Pranksters\", cyberloonies, or a new underground army linked with the anarchists who pissed so spectacularly on the WTO party in Seattle? </p> <p>In a thoughtful editorial on February 10, the Guardian proclaimed itself alarmed but also \"puzzled\". Alarm is understandable. The US economy is booming on the strength of its grotesquely overvalued high-technology stocks. Amazon.com, whose shares have gone up tenfold in four years, has yet to return a cent's profit. No one is quite sure whether this is the Calgary stampede, the 1849 gold rush or Tulipmania. For two years Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, has been trying, vainly, to take the heat out of hi-tech stocks. There's a terrifying risk, if e-commerce proves vulnerable to any computer-literate vandal, that investors will pull out their money and put it somewhere safer. If Wall Street catches a cold, we get pneumonia. What if Wall Street gets pneumonia? Puzzling aspects to this scare remain. How did the crackers suddenly get so smart, so organised, and why are they so hostile to cyber-heroes like Jeff Bezos? Nerds hangouts are buzzing with poisonous suspicion. The US government, they believe, is confecting an electronic Gulf-of-Tonkin pretext for going to war against them. The case is put by \"jim the paranoic\" [sic] on slashdot.org (\"News for Nerds. Stuff that Matters\"). Jim's scenario runs thus: on January 27, Clinton announced in his State of the Union address that \"electronic law enforcement\" would be a high priority. Three days later, the National Security Agency announced that its mainframe had crashed from January 24 to 28. </p> <p>It boggles the imagination that this could happen and that the secretive NSA would embarrass itself by voluntarily making its incompetence public. They instinctively cover their \"asses\", they don't bare them to the world's press. A week later, Clinton's budget allocated $240m to expand, massively, the government's wire-tapping facilities (\"wire\" means world wide web; the FBI will be listening to you, Guardian- reader).

      "bodyText": "Computers crash every day. Servers go down. Bandwiths get congested and networks clog. The IT world is as prone to breakdown and gridlock as our transport systems. But something unusual is happening. Since early February there have been a series of strikes on high-profile e-commerce and e-news targets:Yahoo!, Amazon,Buy.com, Ebay, CNN. The assaults have all followed a pattern - floods of data released by implanted saboteur programs in remote sites. The result, for a few hours, is overload and \"denial of service\": a jam. The raiders were initially assumed to be hackers; pointy-headed kids playing computer games in grown-up places. The authorities were not amused. After the third wave of assaults the raiders were relabelled \"cyber- terrorists\"; up there with Osama Bin Laden. The Justice Department warned of grim penalties: five years and $250,000 for a first offence; 10 years for a second. Attorney general Janet Reno declared: \"We are committed in every way possible to tracking those who are responsible\". Not since the Unabomber have the G-Men seemed so determined to get their man. Who are they? \"Pranksters\", cyberloonies, or a new underground army linked with the anarchists who pissed so spectacularly on the WTO party in Seattle? In a thoughtful editorial on February 10, the Guardian proclaimed itself alarmed but also \"puzzled\". Alarm is understandable. The US economy is booming on the strength of its grotesquely overvalued high-technology stocks. Amazon.com, whose shares have gone up tenfold in four years, has yet to return a cent's profit. No one is quite sure whether this is the Calgary stampede, the 1849 gold rush or Tulipmania. For two years Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, has been trying, vainly, to take the heat out of hi-tech stocks. There's a terrifying risk, if e-commerce proves vulnerable to any computer-literate vandal, that investors will pull out their money and put it somewhere safer. If Wall Street catches a cold, we get pneumonia. What if Wall Street gets pneumonia? Puzzling aspects to this scare remain. How did the crackers suddenly get so smart, so organised, and why are they so hostile to cyber-heroes like Jeff Bezos? Nerds hangouts are buzzing with poisonous suspicion. The US government, they believe, is confecting an electronic Gulf-of-Tonkin pretext for going to war against them. The case is put by \"jim the paranoic\" [sic] on slashdot.org (\"News for Nerds. Stuff that Matters\"). Jim's scenario runs thus: on January 27, Clinton announced in his State of the Union address that \"electronic law enforcement\" would be a high priority. Three days later, the National Security Agency announced that its mainframe had crashed from January 24 to 28. It boggles the imagination that this could happen and that the secretive NSA would embarrass itself by voluntarily making its incompetence public. They instinctively cover their \"asses\", they don't bare them to the world's press. A week later, Clinton's budget allocated $240m to expand, massively, the government's wire-tapping facilities (\"wire\" means world wide web; the FBI will be listening to you, Guardian- reader). Then began the February cyber-assaults on the electronic shopping malls and news services of America. What got less headline attention was that on February 8 the phone systems in Missouri and Oklahoma crashed. Why should those backwoods states be targeted by the new raiders of the net? As Jim darkly speculates: \"It illustrated the horrors of vile cyber-terrorists, but without bothering 'important' people in Washington or on the east and west coasts.

      "body": "<p>I do believe that some inanimate objects have an inherent sexuality. For example: a friend recently moved into a new flat which is, if not gay, then certainly camp. It took her two hours to remove the statue of David fridge-magnet that was clamped to the Smeg she inherited. With a chisel. And when she tried to paint the living room a gentle shade of light grey, it became an unequivocal lilac.</p> <p>So there you go. Things can boast sexual leanings. Given which, I hardly think the Millennium Dome was a screamingly appropriate venue for a \"gay day\".</p> <p>Few things are as heterosexual as the Millennium Dome. I mean heterosexual in the most leaden, uninspiring way. It is this dull, pedestrian heterosexuality that is much of the dome's problem, I'd say. Heterosexual in the Ian Beale, Ken Barlow sense of the word - all hetero and very little sexual. It's as camp as, well, a tent, which, if you think about it, is not actually camp in the least.</p> <p>Nonetheless, the weekend did, indeed, see gay day at the dome. Now, when the event was first announced, it was easy to imagine what the dome had to gain by association with gay culture - a public perception that is a little sparklier, a little more lithe around the hips. You never know. Maybe gay day could render the dome a bit less tent, and a bit more marquee.</p> <p>It was not so easy, however, to imagine what gay culture had to gain by association with the dome. It is hardly Canal Street at dusk.</p> <p>Yet people were encouraged to express their gayness by wearing rainbow clothes, and one particular group were rumoured to have printed a load of T-shirts which read: I'm a domosexual.</p> <p>Inevitably, the people who get cross about such things, did so. Realising that a) gay was catching, and knowing their luck, their year 10 group would contract the permanent Mandelson gay variant, as opposed to the passing-fad type that Michael Portillo was briefly struck down with; that b) their spotty, graceless, monosyllabic adolescent charges were bound to be the prime cruising targets; and that c) there would be no end to the cottaging going on in the body zone, school trips were cancelled.</p> <p>Fewer kids equals less queues, so I thought I'd pop along. Generally, if enough people declare something crap, my expectations are lowered sufficiently, and I'll enjoy it. But on this occasion, no dice. Gay day or not, the dome is one tedious pile of canvas.</p> <p>It took me a while to see between the buggy-wielding couples, the nylon wearing Americans, the over hair-sprayed, Tommy Hilfiger wearing teens, through to the sporadic gay group. Absolutely no sign of the domosexual T-shirts, but still, your average gay punter does seem exotic against the structure's backdrop of absolute banality. I stalk a gay threesome round some zones, and note that one security guard tuts none too subtly at a gay group leader's Burberry check kilt.</p> <p>I begin a gay count, thinking I might be able to conclude something. Life's too short to wait for the body zone, so I count gays in the queue instead: zero.</p> <p>The play zone (rules of the play zone: do not run in the play zone, play fair in the play zone. Very Fight Club); gay count: three, all observing rather than participating.</p> <p>McDonald's: zero, though the staff are much nicer here than in Oxford Street. Aroma Caf\u00e9; gay count: through the roof.</p> <p>Queue for the rainbow tunnel of the rest zone; gay count: zero. The mind zone; gay count: two in the first hall, watching robots shift rubber balls around, three by the heat-sensitive camera, two taking photos of the monster crouching boy, none by the ant colony, eight in the electrical impulses-as-music room. The work zone; gay count: two. The faith zone; gay count: zero.</p> <p>I conclude: gay people don't queue. And no one, regardless of sexual orientation, likes the faith zone.</p> <p>At 3.45, the London Gay Male Voice Choir strike up in the main arena. A sizeable crowd, half gay, half straight, assembles.

      "bodyText": "I do believe that some inanimate objects have an inherent sexuality. For example: a friend recently moved into a new flat which is, if not gay, then certainly camp. It took her two hours to remove the statue of David fridge-magnet that was clamped to the Smeg she inherited. With a chisel. And when she tried to paint the living room a gentle shade of light grey, it became an unequivocal lilac. So there you go. Things can boast sexual leanings. Given which, I hardly think the Millennium Dome was a screamingly appropriate venue for a \"gay day\". Few things are as heterosexual as the Millennium Dome. I mean heterosexual in the most leaden, uninspiring way. It is this dull, pedestrian heterosexuality that is much of the dome's problem, I'd say. Heterosexual in the Ian Beale, Ken Barlow sense of the word - all hetero and very little sexual. It's as camp as, well, a tent, which, if you think about it, is not actually camp in the least. Nonetheless, the weekend did, indeed, see gay day at the dome. Now, when the event was first announced, it was easy to imagine what the dome had to gain by association with gay culture - a public perception that is a little sparklier, a little more lithe around the hips. You never know. Maybe gay day could render the dome a bit less tent, and a bit more marquee. It was not so easy, however, to imagine what gay culture had to gain by association with the dome. It is hardly Canal Street at dusk. Yet people were encouraged to express their gayness by wearing rainbow clothes, and one particular group were rumoured to have printed a load of T-shirts which read: I'm a domosexual. Inevitably, the people who get cross about such things, did so. Realising that a) gay was catching, and knowing their luck, their year 10 group would contract the permanent Mandelson gay variant, as opposed to the passing-fad type that Michael Portillo was briefly struck down with; that b) their spotty, graceless, monosyllabic adolescent charges were bound to be the prime cruising targets; and that c) there would be no end to the cottaging going on in the body zone, school trips were cancelled. Fewer kids equals less queues, so I thought I'd pop along. Generally, if enough people declare something crap, my expectations are lowered sufficiently, and I'll enjoy it. But on this occasion, no dice. Gay day or not, the dome is one tedious pile of canvas. It took me a while to see between the buggy-wielding couples, the nylon wearing Americans, the over hair-sprayed, Tommy Hilfiger wearing teens, through to the sporadic gay group. Absolutely no sign of the domosexual T-shirts, but still, your average gay punter does seem exotic against the structure's backdrop of absolute banality. I stalk a gay threesome round some zones, and note that one security guard tuts none too subtly at a gay group leader's Burberry check kilt. I begin a gay count, thinking I might be able to conclude something. Life's too short to wait for the body zone, so I count gays in the queue instead: zero. The play zone (rules of the play zone: do not run in the play zone, play fair in the play zone. Very Fight Club); gay count: three, all observing rather than participating. McDonald's: zero, though the staff are much nicer here than in Oxford Street. Aroma Caf\u00e9; gay count: through the roof. Queue for the rainbow tunnel of the rest zone; gay count: zero. The mind zone; gay count: two in the first hall, watching robots shift rubber balls around, three by the heat-sensitive camera, two taking photos of the monster crouching boy, none by the ant colony, eight in the electrical impulses-as-music room. The work zone; gay count: two. The faith zone; gay count: zero. I conclude: gay people don't queue. And no one, regardless of sexual orientation, likes the faith zone. At 3.45, the London Gay Male Voice Choir strike up in the main arena. A sizeable crowd, half gay, half straight, assembles. The choir sing a Welsh folk song; Seasons of Love; Aqua's Barbie Girl (dedicated to all the school trips that were allowed to come); Bananarama's Nana Nana Hey Hey (Goodbye) and I Could Have Danced All Night. Apart from one minor slip, when the conductor adopts domespeak and says: \"It's not about who you sleep with, it's about who you love\" (rather too reminiscent of the ghastly soundbites about working together that cover all available dome wall space), it is by far the best thing on offer. But then it's over, and there is nothing for it but to plough on. After three hours, I feel the exact opposite of gay, in any sense of the word. It must be an incredible time to be gay: things to be rallied against, things to be celebrated. Surely there are better places to do it?",

      "body": "<p>This may be St Valentine's Day, but the great love-in is over. Last Friday's Gallup Poll in the Daily Telegraph made Tony Blair's Labour look, more than ever before, like a government in the customary throes of mid-term.</p> <p>More than six in 10 of us are no longer convinced that Labour is fulfilling its promise to be tough on crime and the cause of crime. More than seven in 10 decline to believe that the NHS is improving. Around the same numbers make the same judgment of public transport. Even on education, education, education, only 48% are happy with this government's performance against 44% who are not. The economy too - Gordon Brown's miracle - turns out to lack universal acclaim with respondents agreeing by a margin of 43% to 40% that the old stop-go cycle has yet to be conquered. And Mr Blair's familiar appeal to \"trust me\" no longer gets the response that it did - almost half of us no longer accept that this government has on balance been honest and trustworthy.</p> <p>Some of these condemnations are just, others less so. Discontent with the NHS, which did so much to erode Labour's standing at the turn of the year, reflects the decision, taken in the hope of stamping this government at the outset with the hallmark of extreme economic rectitude, to stick with Conservative spending plans (plans which Ken Clarke, who devised them, would plainly have abandoned with his usual insouciance had circumstances demanded it). The early stages of devolution may be souring things too. That the Northern Ireland assembly folded so soon is unlikely to be scored against Labour, but the headlines on recent events in Scotland and Wales in newspapers hostile to devolution create the impression of a writhing, wrangling mess. That is unjust. Much of what has happened in Edinburgh and Cardiff is part of the growing-up process which all such institutions have to go through. The toppling of Alun Michael, especially, happened because Wales demanded real devolution, and not just cosmetic version. It was Downing Street's reluctance to let go of the leading strings, here as with the London mayoralty, which fomented the trouble.</p> <p>There are other disappointments too: the retreat from past aspirations on freedom of information, the pathetic farce of the Wakeham \"reform\" of the Lords, the shelving of the commitment to a referendum on changing the electoral system. But these are the preoccupations of the political class. What is more unnerving for Labour is that people should doubt on the scale that Gallup suggests Labour's management of the economy. The Telegraph thinks the finding that the \"stop-go\" cycle has yet to be conquered is \"puzzling\". Not outside the south-east it isn't. There, as across much of manufacturing industry, the relentless rise of the pound, fuelled by a succession of interest rate rises, has old economics written all over it. We cannot run the economy in the interest of a single region, the governor of the Bank, Eddie George, insists on his travels to Scotland and the north-east or wherever the natives are turbulent. But that is just how it looks as you travel away from London. The overwhelming objective of the policy is to stifle a boom which has hardly been felt in large swathes of the country. Of course there is boom and bust: but it's the south-east's boom, and their bust.</p> <p>And yet this unpopular government is not an unpopular government. Some 49% would vote for it in a general election tomorrow - a phenomenal figure for any government in mid-term. The explanation is plain. The electorate this St Valentine's Day may be cooling in its ardour for Labour but it is certainly not succumbing to the suitor next door. People may be less than content with Labour's economic management, but Labour still has a 23-point lead as the party best equipped to handle economic difficulties. The nation's esteem for Tony Blair may be edging downwards, but he is still streets ahead of his rivals; 54% rate him the best of the bunch against 14% for William Hague and 11% for Charles Kennedy. As the Telegraph's Gallup analyst, Professor Tony King, unchallengeably concludes: \"a well-respected opposition party would probably be making sweeping gains at Labour's expense.\"</p> <p>There is a further factor at work which no examination of the state of our politics can now afford to exclude. The fastest growing group in the British electorate over the past three decades has been the non-voters. In 1997, just 31% of the qualified electorate gave Labour its triumph; almost 29% did not vote at all. Just 22% backed the Tories. Parliamentary byelections and last year's Euro-elections have told a similar story. This year's local elections could see very low turn-outs, with Labour, if its supporters have the least motivation, losing many seats by default. Like Conservative councillors dumped in the Thatcher years, many Labour stalwarts will feel their careers have been terminated more because of the national leadership than because of themselves.</p> <p>Mr Blair needs to take all this seriously, for two reasons. First, because he still needs his party, even though on this St Valentine's Day it feels gravely unloved by him, and in turn loves him less than it loved some past leaders who steered it far less successfully. Second, and still more important, because a society switched off from politics, increasingly of the view that politics is a minority sport which makes little difference to people's everyday lives, is an ailing, alienated society, and one which a Labour prime minister especially should feel anxious to plug back in before the malaise goes deeper.</p>",

      "bodyText": "This may be St Valentine's Day, but the great love-in is over. Last Friday's Gallup Poll in the Daily Telegraph made Tony Blair's Labour look, more than ever before, like a government in the customary throes of mid-term. More than six in 10 of us are no longer convinced that Labour is fulfilling its promise to be tough on crime and the cause of crime. More than seven in 10 decline to believe that the NHS is improving. Around the same numbers make the same judgment of public transport. Even on education, education, education, only 48% are happy with this government's performance against 44% who are not. The economy too - Gordon Brown's miracle - turns out to lack universal acclaim with respondents agreeing by a margin of 43% to 40% that the old stop-go cycle has yet to be conquered. And Mr Blair's familiar appeal to \"trust me\" no longer gets the response that it did - almost half of us no longer accept that this government has on balance been honest and trustworthy. Some of these condemnations are just, others less so. Discontent with the NHS, which did so much to erode Labour's standing at the turn of the year, reflects the decision, taken in the hope of stamping this government at the outset with the hallmark of extreme economic rectitude, to stick with Conservative spending plans (plans which Ken Clarke, who devised them, would plainly have abandoned with his usual insouciance had circumstances demanded it). The early stages of devolution may be souring things too. That the Northern Ireland assembly folded so soon is unlikely to be scored against Labour, but the headlines on recent events in Scotland and Wales in newspapers hostile to devolution create the impression of a writhing, wrangling mess. That is unjust. Much of what has happened in Edinburgh and Cardiff is part of the growing-up process which all such institutions have to go through. The toppling of Alun Michael, especially, happened because Wales demanded real devolution, and not just cosmetic version. It was Downing Street's reluctance to let go of the leading strings, here as with the London mayoralty, which fomented the trouble. There are other disappointments too: the retreat from past aspirations on freedom of information, the pathetic farce of the Wakeham \"reform\" of the Lords, the shelving of the commitment to a referendum on changing the electoral system. But these are the preoccupations of the political class. What is more unnerving for Labour is that people should doubt on the scale that Gallup suggests Labour's management of the economy. The Telegraph thinks the finding that the \"stop-go\" cycle has yet to be conquered is \"puzzling\". Not outside the south-east it isn't. There, as across much of manufacturing industry, the relentless rise of the pound, fuelled by a succession of interest rate rises, has old economics written all over it. We cannot run the economy in the interest of a single region, the governor of the Bank, Eddie George, insists on his travels to Scotland and the north-east or wherever the natives are turbulent. But that is just how it looks as you travel away from London. The overwhelming objective of the policy is to stifle a boom which has hardly been felt in large swathes of the country. Of course there is boom and bust: but it's the south-east's boom, and their bust. And yet this unpopular government is not an unpopular government. Some 49% would vote for it in a general election tomorrow - a phenomenal figure for any government in mid-term. The explanation is plain. The electorate this St Valentine's Day may be cooling in its ardour for Labour but it is certainly not succumbing to the suitor next door. People may be less than content with Labour's economic management, but Labour still has a 23-point lead as the party best equipped to handle economic difficulties. The nation's esteem for Tony Blair may be edging downwards, but he is still streets ahead of his rivals; 54% rate him the best of the bunch against 14% for William Hague and 11% for Charles Kennedy. As the Telegraph's Gallup analyst, Professor Tony King, unchallengeably concludes: \"a well-respected opposition party would probably be making sweeping gains at Labour's expense.\" There is a further factor at work which no examination of the state of our politics can now afford to exclude. The fastest growing group in the British electorate over the past three decades has been the non-voters. In 1997, just 31% of the qualified electorate gave Labour its triumph; almost 29% did not vote at all. Just 22% backed the Tories. Parliamentary byelections and last year's Euro-elections have told a similar story. This year's local elections could see very low turn-outs, with Labour, if its supporters have the least motivation, losing many seats by default. Like Conservative councillors dumped in the Thatcher years, many Labour stalwarts will feel their careers have been terminated more because of the national leadership than because of themselves. Mr Blair needs to take all this seriously, for two reasons. First, because he still needs his party, even though on this St Valentine's Day it feels gravely unloved by him, and in turn loves him less than it loved some past leaders who steered it far less successfully. Second, and still more important, because a society switched off from politics, increasingly of the view that politics is a minority sport which makes little difference to people's everyday lives, is an ailing, alienated society, and one which a Labour prime minister especially should feel anxious to plug back in before the malaise goes deeper.",

The figures suggest that either the home secretary is more keen than any other minister to hold inquiries into leaked information or he is presiding over the most leaky ministry in Whitehall. The list - released after a request by the Guardian under John Major's \"open government\" code - shows that Labour has had almost as many serious leaks from Whitehall as the last two years of the Tory government. So far there have been 60 leak investigations compared to 70 in the last two years of John Major's administration. Jack Straw tops the list with nine investigations. These include an inconclusive inquiry into the premature disclosure of the findings of the Stephen Lawrence inquiry to the Sunday Telegraph, and the Guardian's disclosure of Mr Straw's minute to the cabinet detailing his climbdown over some of the more draconian proposals in the freedom of information bill.

Scottish ministers are coming under pressure from a parliamentary committee to amend forthcoming legislation with a clause which would, for the first time in Britain, enshrine the equal status of same-sex relationships on statute. The issue has arisen from the incapable adults bill, which grants rights to the nearest relatives of someone who becomes incapable of making significant decisions for themselves. Currently, the law overlooks same sex partners in favour of parents or brothers and sisters. Jim Wallace, the justice minister, said last year that he intended to end this type of discrimination. Yesterday the Conservatives said they would not support Mr Wallace if the bill made same-sex relationships equal to marriage. The party's home affairs spokesman, Phil Gallie, said: \"Marriage is a contract between two people, drawn up to offer security and also to protect children, and, on that basis, gay relationships can never be seen to be on an equal footing.\" Officials and ministers initially drew up a definition which would give same-sex couples who had been living together for at least six months the same status as unmarried heterosexual couples. But MSPs said that was unfair towards same-sex couples, and the parliament's equal opportunities committee has made it clear that it will not allow the legislation to be discriminatory. Officials will this week attempt to come up with a new definition which will meet the concerns of the committee. If it does not, the committee intends to make sure that the issue goes before the full parliament for debate.",

      "bodyText": "Police forces around the country will today be set individual five-year targets to slash burglary and car crime under a government drive to bring down wide regional variations in crime levels. Jack Straw, the home secretary, will announce that, if targets are met, domestic burglary will fall by a quarter by 2005 while car crime will drop by 30%. The new goals, which also include a 17% cut in robberies, follow last month's figures showing that crime is rising for the first time since 1992. This is the first time individual forces, and even their component command units, have been given goals reflecting their performance, rather being asked to work towards a national average crime reduction. Ministers are anxious to put an end to wide variations in crime levels within and between regions when other circumstances such as population and poverty levels are comparable. The new effort to make those forces with the worst track records work hardest to do better is based on a similar approach used in school improvement. There, schools are matched against those in similar catchment areas to identify good and bad performance. A Downing Street source said last night: \"What we can't understand is why there are such variations between units in virtually identical areas. The aim is to get the standard equal to the best in the country.\" Details of the new targets will be given by Mr Straw during a visit with the prime minister to Newham, east London, where they will view a new closed circuit television system. The home secretary will say that the latest crime figures revealed \"patchy\" performances between and within forces. He will add: \"We can and must do better. These targets are ambitious but achievable - they will give a real focus to our fight against crime. \"The criminal justice system has a way to go to match the strides that have been taken in other public services like health and education in monitoring and improving performance.\" Domestic burglary and car crime have been chosen as the headline target areas because they are the crimes which, according to surveys, most concern the public. Individual police authorities have been asked to propose their own targets - to be published as provisional goals today - but these then go to the home secretary for review and can be raised if considered insufficiently ambitious. Final fixed targets will be published in April with the toughest expected to be for forces in the cities, where 70% of crimes occur. Five forces in big metropolitan areas have been told to produce targets to cut robberies. Seventy per cent of robberies take place in London, West Yorkshire, Merseyside, the West Midlands and Greater Manchester. Last year there were 1,720,241 car thefts, 74,843 robberies or muggings and 935,423 burglaries.",

The father and grandfather of one of the boys were also seriously hurt when the family group took the impact on a right-angle bend in the cross-country course at Otterburn army ranges in Northumberland. The surviving child, seven, was taken to Newcastle upon Tyne general infirmary unconscious with head injuries and a fractured femur, while paramedics tried vainly to revive his cousin. Three other spectators, among only a handful on the verge of the narrow road as rally cars sped by, are in hospital with less serious injuries and shock. The victims were hit by a Vauxhall Nova, driven by one of the last of 69 amateur competitors in Wickham motorclub's annual Apex Cheviot event. It veered into gravel at about 50mph, took off and landed on the group. The driver, a Tyneside man in his 20s who had never competed in a rally before, was discharged from Hexham general hospital last night with his navigator after both had been treated for minor injuries and severe shock. Both the children had to be cut free from the wreckage.

The \"baby bond\", which could be spent on education, training, starting a business or buying a house, would be designed to counter growing inequality in asset ownership. But the idea put forward by the institute for public policy research, which is regarded as close to the government, is likely to alarm Labour traditionalists seeking higher spending on public services and social security benefits. There will be further concern at the institute's admission that it wants to see the centre-left create \"a new politics of private ownership\". In a report, Ownership for All, researchers say: \"Progressive politics needs to become less preoccupied with the structure of ownership of organisations and more concerned about the opportunities that individuals have to own assets.\" Inequality of asset ownership has not been identified by the government as an indicator of social exclusion, although ministers are committed to raising the proportion of the working population contributing to a non-state pension.

      "body": "<p>Some things never change. In 1477 Medieval Man was just as slippery as today's New Man, particularly when it came to the c-word - commitment.</p> <p>So on February 14, 523 years ago, when Margery Brews, a forthright lady of the Fens, wrote the oldest surviving valentine in the world, she used the full range of womanly wiles. First she flattered her true love, then she appealed to his chivalry. Then, with his guard lowered, she followed through with good old fashioned emotional blackmail.</p> <p>John Paston, you see, was a mite reluctant. And his father, a goodly Norfolk squire, was not overly impressed with the size of her dowry.</p> <p>\"But if you love me,\" implored Margery, \"as I trust verily that you do, you will not leave me therefore. For even if you had not half the livelihood that you have, for to do the greatest labour that any woman alive might, I would not forsake you. \"</p> <p>The message was clear: marry me, you cad.</p> <p>Keen to cover herself, if the valentine should fail, Margery signed off: \"And I beseech you that this bill be not seen by any non earthly creature, save only yourself.\"</p> <p>John kept the note, showed it to his folks, and it will be on display at the British Library next month in an exhibition called Chapter &amp; Verse.</p> <p>Margery eventually got her man, said the curator, Chris Fletcher. \"They even had two sons. It's a fascinating story, a marvellous insight into the way love and marriage was contracted in the Middle Ages.\"</p> <p>For not only was John's father a bit snooty about Margery, his big brother (also called John) tried to put a spanner in the works. \"He was jealous, infuriated in fact, that his mother had given a manor house to his brother to make him a more attractive prospect to Margery,\" said Mr Fletcher.</p> <p>The older John died horribly the following year of plague - a salutary warning to anyone who might interfere in the course of true love.</p> <p>A reluctant bridegroom he might have been, but John Paston could not have been all that choosy.

      "bodyText": "Some things never change. In 1477 Medieval Man was just as slippery as today's New Man, particularly when it came to the c-word - commitment. So on February 14, 523 years ago, when Margery Brews, a forthright lady of the Fens, wrote the oldest surviving valentine in the world, she used the full range of womanly wiles. First she flattered her true love, then she appealed to his chivalry. Then, with his guard lowered, she followed through with good old fashioned emotional blackmail. John Paston, you see, was a mite reluctant. And his father, a goodly Norfolk squire, was not overly impressed with the size of her dowry. \"But if you love me,\" implored Margery, \"as I trust verily that you do, you will not leave me therefore. For even if you had not half the livelihood that you have, for to do the greatest labour that any woman alive might, I would not forsake you. \" The message was clear: marry me, you cad. Keen to cover herself, if the valentine should fail, Margery signed off: \"And I beseech you that this bill be not seen by any non earthly creature, save only yourself.\" John kept the note, showed it to his folks, and it will be on display at the British Library next month in an exhibition called Chapter &amp; Verse. Margery eventually got her man, said the curator, Chris Fletcher. \"They even had two sons. It's a fascinating story, a marvellous insight into the way love and marriage was contracted in the Middle Ages.\" For not only was John's father a bit snooty about Margery, his big brother (also called John) tried to put a spanner in the works. \"He was jealous, infuriated in fact, that his mother had given a manor house to his brother to make him a more attractive prospect to Margery,\" said Mr Fletcher. The older John died horribly the following year of plague - a salutary warning to anyone who might interfere in the course of true love. A reluctant bridegroom he might have been, but John Paston could not have been all that choosy. He tried to get hitched to 10 different women in the year before he met Margery, and wrote despairingly to his brother: \"I pray, get us a wife somewhere.\" Contrary to perfidious foreign - mostly French - propaganda that Anglo-Saxons are a cold and unromantic race, it was the English who invented the valentine. The tradition really got going only in the 16th century, though the origins are older, said Mr Fletcher. \"Paper valentines started the greeting card business as we know it. They had nothing really to do with the various St Valentines [obscure Roman and Byzantine martyrs] and more to do with the time of year.\" As Chaucer wrote in Parliament of Foules: For this was sent on Seynt Valentyne's day Whan every foul cometh ther to choose his mate. It was a simple case of when the sap rose, and the birds began to pair, men and women's thoughts also turned to their loins and love. \"Margery Brews comes over as a subtle, literate, intelligent woman, someone who knew how to manipulate,\" said Mr Fletcher. \"She was very similar to another remarkable Norfolk woman of the time, Margery Kemp, who wrote the first autobiography we know of.\" The men may have held the power and the purse, but it was the women who pulled the strings, he said. \"Margery and John's mothers really made the match.

      "bodyText": "Labour is heading for a full-scale confrontation with the Lords over the election for mayor of London which could lead to legal challenges to contest rules or even the postponement of the poll, set for May 4, government sources warned yesterday. The prospect of a head-to-head clash with the opposition parties, centred on the government's refusal to agree to free postal delivery for mayoral candidates, comes as Labour's battle over its own candidate nears its climax. Voting for the candidate ends at 5pm on Wednesday, with the result expected next weekend. Two of Labour's three nominees, Ken Livingstone and Glenda Jackson, are piling on complaints about a process they regard as rigged against them. But the possibility of the election itself being in question has become more serious as Labour has dug in its heels over the polling rules and the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, who are expected to command a Lords majority, prepare to vote down the government's plans. \"Positions have hardened in recent days, and we're now on a confrontation course,\" one minister involved in the negotiations said last night. The government's regulations for the mayoral poll - which fix deposits and spending limits - are due to be debated in the Lords tonight, but the crunch is expected next week when they are expected to be defeated unless Labour concedes a freepost mailing for all candidates. Ministers say that could mean that the poll would have to be held under ordinary local election rules, without any deposit requirement and \"severe\" limitations on spending. But others, including home office officials and the Electoral Reform Society, believe that may be challengeable in law and that, if the government's regulations are rejected, the election will have to be postponed. The government argues that freepost delivery of election addresses - as allowed in elections to Westminster, the European parliament and the devolved Scottish parliament and Welsh assembly - would be too expensive and would give free rein to fringe and \"unscrupulous\" candidates. The opposition parties believe the government line is partly motivated by fear that Mr Livingstone might still run as an independent - and benefit from a free mailshot - if he is defeated in Labour's electoral college. Mr Livingstone said yesterday that the three-day gap between the close of voting in Labour's ballot on Wednesday and the counting of postal votes was an \"open invitation to fraud\", and demanded the right to have his own scrutineers. Both he and Ms Jackson's campaign team said Labour's decision to give a vote to Pauline Green, who retired as a London MEP in December, was in breach of the party's rules, which require all MPs and MEPs to be \"in receipt of the Labour whip\" to qualify to vote. A Labour spokesman countered that the three-day gap was to allow challenges and appeals and that Ms Green was able to vote because she was an MEP on the qualifying date last September. Ms Jackson's spokesman also branded as \"Bulgarian-style democracy\" a decision by the Co-operative party in south London on Friday to cast its 50,000 votes in Labour's electoral college for the third nominee, the former health secretary Frank Dobson - as expected - without a ballot.",

It was officially clarified by changing the law in the 1996 budget. This allowed the prime minister, the speaker, all cabinet ministers and ministers who were assigned their own government drivers to be the only people in Britain given the right to be exempt from company car tax. The tax perk was also extended to cover the leader of the opposition and the opposition chief whip who also get chauffeur-driven cars. Now Mr Brown has gone one stage better and extended the tax perk to ministers in the Scottish parliament, Welsh assembly and the suspended Northern Ireland assembly. The deal also covers Lord Steel, the presiding officer of the Scottish parliament, Lord Elis-Thomas, the presiding officer of the Welsh assembly and Lord Alderdice, the presiding officer of the Northern Ireland assembly. The inland revenue confirmed yesterday that the change in the law had been made in a clause in last year's budget. It coincided with a hike in company car tax as part of an attack to curb business users. The change in the law was made before the establishment of the new devolved parliaments and increased the number of people exempt from company car tax from about 100 ministers to nearly 150. Maurice Fitzpatrick, head of corporate tax at accountants, Chantrey Vellacott DFK, estimates that the perk is worth \u00a35,414 a year for most cabinet ministers. This is based on a the fact they are using a \u00a320,000 car and have to pay standard fuel charges, tax on part of the chauffeur's salary and a \u00a3798 national insurance bill.",

      "bodyText": "Labour activists have urged their leadership to place redistribution, including commitments to end child and pensioner poverty and to restore full employment, at the heart of the party's manifesto for the next election. Consultation of the grassroots found that local parties wanted Labour to move further towards a \"redistributive tax system\" as part of \"building fairness\" in a second term in office. The recommendation is contained in a consultation document on economic policy which will feed into the manifesto under Labour's newly established policy development process. Although Gordon Brown, the chancellor, has no obligation to take every proposal on board, he could not ignore the conclusions of a process the party frequently bills as democratic. The proposals will be widely interpreted as a sign of grassroots frustration at Labour's wooing of middle England at the expense of its core voters, though party insiders last night insisted the references to redistribution indicated a new willingness to drop the self-imposed doctrine of always \"acting left, talking right\". The document is one of six second phase policy papers being sent out to constituency parties as pressures grow on the leadership to beware of growing disaffection in Labour's heartlands. Peter Kilfoyle, whose resignation as defence minister threw a spotlight on mounting concern among MPs and activists that the party is failing to address the issues that matter to its core voters, yesterday warned that voters regarded New Labour as merely \"a conspiracy to defraud them\". The Liverpool Walton MP called for increased spending to be put ahead of tax cuts to reflect the heavy reliance of the poor on state services. Meanwhile, the government faces more accusations of neglecting its core constituency with the expected announcement this week that there will be no rise in the \u00a33.60 minimum hourly wage until April next year. Backbenchers are threatening an unprecedented vote against the freeze at this Wednesday's meeting of the parliamentary party. In response to an initial policy document published a year ago, party members have called for a rewrite to focus on achieving Labour's open-ended commitment to full employment and on child poverty, which the party has pledged to eradicate within 20 years. A report on the first phase of consultation included in the new document also raises the possibility of achieving full employment within 10 years. It says: \"In the next decade, if we stay the course of reform, it can be one of our country's proudest achievements\".

Writer Bryan Elsley, who adapted the Iain Banks novel, The Crow Road, has created an ambitious four-part drama that operates as a kind of Kes 2: The Revenge. David, a 16-year-old foster lad brought up on the industrial wastelands of Barrow-in-Furness, finds escape from domestic cruelty and social deprivation in caring for his stepfather's caged birds. </p> <p>However, unlike Loach's anti-hero, who shares the same hobby and predicament, David is motivated to leave his dead-end home town, following the violent death of a young foster-girl he's befriended. Elsley's drama picks up where Loach left off, taking David on a picaresque journey across every social and geographical divide in Britain, in order to find his real father. </p> <p>The cod symbolism of the \"caged bird\" aside (avoided in Kes because the main character didn't have lines like \"he's pulling his feathers out, he needs to be free!\"), episode one of Nature Boy is a startling piece of drama.

The performances by 16-year-old Lee Ingleby and 17-year-old Anne Marie Cooper are flawless. </p> <p>In fact, the whole thing is so flawless, it raises worrying questions about the idea of poverty as entertainment. Nature Boy walks an ambiguous line between empathy and voyeurism. The photography and styling are remarkably similar to that of fashion shoots in the mid-90s: teenage girl in tracksuit snorting speed in her bedroom. Beth Orton and Pulp feature obtrusively on the soundtrack, the latter as a particularly ill-judged accompaniment to a single mum shooting up heroin. </p> <p>The programme makers argue that this reflects the reality of teen Britain, and that they're working in the tradition of social realist TV drama. \"At the moment, TV runs the risk of being too glossy,\" says Joe Wright, \"so we intended to make something as brutal as the kind of thing Alan Clarke [director of Scum and The Firm] did. I think there's a heritage that sometimes gets forgotten.\" </p> <p>But TV doesn't forget, it revives - and at present, the working class are in vogue again. On BBC1, as Neighbours At War. On BBC2, helping Modern Times to remould itself as hard-hitting documentary, dropping the comedy of middle-class manners for dog-kicking council estates. </p> <p>Nature Boy, like the recent one-off Storm Damage, and BBC1's more sensationalist The Lakes, is part of a cross-channel revival of gritty drama about disenfranchised youth. Programme makers go through the motions of saying they want to raise awareness and create a debate (one that C4 would have Jon Snow chair ing), but the truth is that they're exploiting an increasing appetite for social deprivation as glamorous tableaux. Poverty porn, if you like. </p> <p>One uncharitable explanation for this is that the middle class love to watch poor people when they're feeling prosperous, but stop when there's a hint of recession. As interest rates go up, so the argument goes, dramas like Nature Boy will be replaced with Inspector Morse/Darling Buds Of May escapism - both series that were first popular during the long nights of late-80s recession. </p> <p>Intentionally or not, it's true that dramatists are conspiring to create a fictional rock'n'roll underclass - more Larry Clark than Alan Clarke - in order to make compelling believable drama. But it's not true that this so-called poverty porn is less powerful for being sensationalist, or having a moral ambiguity towards it subject. </p> <p>Forty years ago, Cathy Come Home jammed the BBC switchboard with callers incredulous that such a thing as forced adoption could happen in Britain.

During Mr Wahid's absence there were fears that Gen Wiranto and his loyalists within the military might launch a coup, but few people believe this is likely now. Gen Wiranto is becoming increasingly isolated. On Friday the military broke its 10-day silence and publicly backed Mr Wahid against the general. The armed forces commander, Admiral Widodo Adi Sutjipto, told parliament that the military would accept whatever Mr Wahid decided. Two weeks ago Indonesia's human rights commission implicated Gen Wiranto and 32 others in crimes against humanity during and after the independence referendum in East Timor last August. A United Nations report says Indonesia's military, led by Gen Wiranto, helped organise and took part in the campaign of murder and destruction. Within hours of the Indonesian report being published, Mr Wahid, who was on a 16-day overseas tour, said Gen Wiranto should resign. He repeated the demand several times before returning to Indonesia yesterday.

      "bodyText": "Nine arrests on polling day The second and final day of voting in Zimbabwe's constitutional referendum was marked by the arrest of the human rights lawyer Tendai Biti and eight others as they campaigned against President Robert Mugabe's draft constitution, writes Andrew Meldrum in Harare. Opposition groups plan to mount a legal challenge to the referendum result, citing alleged voting irregularities. UN mines probe at El Alamein A United Nations delegation headed to El Alamein yesterday to assess Egypt's needs in its efforts to rid the second world war battleground of landmines. Egypt has an estimated 22m mines buried along its western borders. It argues that since it did not plant the mines, it should not be expected to foot the bill for removing them. [AP, Cairo] Protests at oil tanker spill Environmentalists and fishermen took dozens of boats out to sea yesterday to protest against fuel oil allegedly still spilling from a Russian tanker which split in two at the mouth of the Bosporus strait on December 29.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Halfway up a mountain, the village of San Giuseppe Jato is humming with new sewing machines. Each week a truck delivers rolls of cloth to a group of women in grey smocks. They distribute the rolls and return to their machines. The truck loads up with small cardboard boxes and trundles back into the valley.</p> <p>It is from this village that mafia slyness, corruption and barbarity seeped across Sicily, and so, as the truck winds towards the coast, it is using the same road as the assassins, past crumbling houses - the legacy of twisted deals - and into Palermo port, from where the boxes are shipped, their task: redemption.</p> <p>Jobs and rehabilitation, things Sicily craves but has been denied, are at stake this week. Models will strut down a Milan catwalk and into the world's gaze wearing the coppola of San Giuseppe Jato: a fashion-show debut of the cap of the mafia from the town of the mafia, made to defy the mafia.</p> <p>This is a deadly serious attempt to revive an industry and wage cultural war against Cosa Nostra. Shows in Barcelona, New York, London, Paris and Tokyo will follow, accompanied by an exhibition, a blaze of publicity and, it is hoped, huge sales. Designers, entrepreneurs, politicians and intellectuals have mobilised to turn a cap associated with murder and intimidation into a fashion icon. The mobsters are gobsmacked.</p> <p>San Giuseppe Jato is to be just the beginning. Another 312 communes have been sounded out as production centres. Such is their confidence - or desperation - they all said yes. An island inured to optimism after half a century of political killings is turning giddy. Can the years of waiting for a breakthrough - a chance to banish the mafia nightmare, rescue the economy and present a new Sicily to the world - be accomplished by something so simple? By a hat?</p> <p>Historians have tried and failed to pinpoint the origin of the coppola, which appeared two centuries ago in Italy, Spain, France, Britain and Ireland. The brim and shape varied, but not by much. A 1783 Palermo dictionary of Sicilian-Italian-Latin recorded coppola as being connected to \"birrittu\", or beret. Dimensions were indicated with the variant names cuppulina and cuppuluni.</p> <p>According to Giuseppe Pitre, a 19th-century chronicler, Sicilian men wore a \"beret of brown cloth for the peasants, light blue for the seamen, which, folded, hung upon the right shoulder\". Peasants with white coppolas were featured in an 1891 exhibition in Palermo, but most turn-of-the-century cinematographers who strived for pastoral imagery showed peasants bareheaded.</p> <p>In some parts of Sicily the custom that only landed gentry had the right to wear a hat lasted into the 20th century. Bizarrely, a huge boost to the coppola's popularity was the arrival of the motor car. The peak shielded eyes from sunshine and kept rain from goggles, and the fit was tight enough to keep it on the head. Why carless peasants adopted it remains a mystery, but by the 1920s it was embedded in the language. \"Tanto di coppola\", hats off, was an expression of respect, and, according to some historians, may have been linked to its evolution as the mafia's headgear.</p> <p>\"As a little girl, I did not understand why sometimes the grown-ups whispered about coppole and coppole storte [twisted cap, a nickname for mafiosi], with oblique glances of fear, respect, reverence. As an adult, I understood,\" says Maria Maniscalco, mayor of San Giuseppe Jato.</p> <p>Small, hard men, members of the Cosa Nostra had their own territory, code and hierarchy, a state within a state, so it was only natural they wanted their own uniform. The coppola was enough and it was perfect. Fifty years ago, virtually all Sicilian men had one, but mafia members wore it in a certain way. The peak could be tilted up or down, the brim straight or angled, the eyes revealed or hidden. It all meant something: rank, attitude or intent.</p> <p>Mafia experts agree that the organisation's triumph was to make itself of Sicily, to manipulate symbols and mould the essence of identity until Cosa Nostra and Sicily became indistinguishable. Writers and film-makers caught on. By the time the aptly named Francis Coppola made The Godfather, in 1972, Robert De Niro and Al Pacino were compelled to wear it.</p> <p>Friday's debut in Milan will be an attempt to reclaim history. Designers such as Gianfranco Ferr\u00e9, Krizia and Missoni have spurned payment to come up with a range of styles for children, men and women, using plastic, cotton, iron, felt, lace, denim, tweed and python skin. There is a wedding coppola, a waterproof coppola, a knitted coppola, a spouting volcano coppola, a perfumed coppola, a coppola with zips, a coppola with eyes and a tongue, a coppola with false chocolates.</p> <p>San Giuseppe Jato is 30km inland from Palermo, the island's capital. The higher the climb, the worse the road gets. Ears pop, the markings vanish, the surface turns gritty. Jato valley's greens and yellows sweep below, the mountain swirls into the clouds above.</p> <p>A heavy fog veils oncoming traffic, but Guido Agnello, wiry and chainsmoking, is in a hurry. It was his idea six years ago to reclaim the coppola; now it is near fruition, he is a ball of nervous energy. \"It must work! It will work!\" he says. He is president of the Palazzo Intelligente foundation, which has tapped European Union and United Nations funds for cultural and economic initiatives. For the coppola project, there was only one place to start, the village of tattered, two-storey concrete blocks looming from the mist. Symbolism and economics demanded it.</p> <p>This is the heartland of Costa Nostra, where 11 May Day picnickers were massacred in 1947, heralding an era of political assassination; where Bernardo Brusca and his son Giovanni masterminded their clan's carving up of contracts and rivals; where Baldassare Di Maggio opened a tomb to hide the two bazookas, two Kalashnikovs and two containers of plastic explosive intended for the mafia's greatest enemies: the judges Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, and the mayor of Palermo, Leoluca Orlando.</p> <p>The judges died in 1992, but the wave of revulsion that swept Sicily galvanised the state into doing something it should have done decades before: catch and jail Salvatore Riina, the boss of bosses. Cosa Nostra is not the force it was, but it endures, intimidating and corrupting.</p> <p>The women receiving the new rolls of cloth know all this, but for them the new coppola factory is about jobs and pay packets where before there were none. There are seven of them working at three tables placed at the end of an 800 sq metre plant.

      "bodyText": "Halfway up a mountain, the village of San Giuseppe Jato is humming with new sewing machines. Each week a truck delivers rolls of cloth to a group of women in grey smocks. They distribute the rolls and return to their machines. The truck loads up with small cardboard boxes and trundles back into the valley. It is from this village that mafia slyness, corruption and barbarity seeped across Sicily, and so, as the truck winds towards the coast, it is using the same road as the assassins, past crumbling houses - the legacy of twisted deals - and into Palermo port, from where the boxes are shipped, their task: redemption. Jobs and rehabilitation, things Sicily craves but has been denied, are at stake this week. Models will strut down a Milan catwalk and into the world's gaze wearing the coppola of San Giuseppe Jato: a fashion-show debut of the cap of the mafia from the town of the mafia, made to defy the mafia. This is a deadly serious attempt to revive an industry and wage cultural war against Cosa Nostra. Shows in Barcelona, New York, London, Paris and Tokyo will follow, accompanied by an exhibition, a blaze of publicity and, it is hoped, huge sales. Designers, entrepreneurs, politicians and intellectuals have mobilised to turn a cap associated with murder and intimidation into a fashion icon. The mobsters are gobsmacked. San Giuseppe Jato is to be just the beginning. Another 312 communes have been sounded out as production centres. Such is their confidence - or desperation - they all said yes. An island inured to optimism after half a century of political killings is turning giddy. Can the years of waiting for a breakthrough - a chance to banish the mafia nightmare, rescue the economy and present a new Sicily to the world - be accomplished by something so simple? By a hat? Historians have tried and failed to pinpoint the origin of the coppola, which appeared two centuries ago in Italy, Spain, France, Britain and Ireland. The brim and shape varied, but not by much. A 1783 Palermo dictionary of Sicilian-Italian-Latin recorded coppola as being connected to \"birrittu\", or beret. Dimensions were indicated with the variant names cuppulina and cuppuluni. According to Giuseppe Pitre, a 19th-century chronicler, Sicilian men wore a \"beret of brown cloth for the peasants, light blue for the seamen, which, folded, hung upon the right shoulder\". Peasants with white coppolas were featured in an 1891 exhibition in Palermo, but most turn-of-the-century cinematographers who strived for pastoral imagery showed peasants bareheaded. In some parts of Sicily the custom that only landed gentry had the right to wear a hat lasted into the 20th century. Bizarrely, a huge boost to the coppola's popularity was the arrival of the motor car. The peak shielded eyes from sunshine and kept rain from goggles, and the fit was tight enough to keep it on the head. Why carless peasants adopted it remains a mystery, but by the 1920s it was embedded in the language. \"Tanto di coppola\", hats off, was an expression of respect, and, according to some historians, may have been linked to its evolution as the mafia's headgear. \"As a little girl, I did not understand why sometimes the grown-ups whispered about coppole and coppole storte [twisted cap, a nickname for mafiosi], with oblique glances of fear, respect, reverence. As an adult, I understood,\" says Maria Maniscalco, mayor of San Giuseppe Jato. Small, hard men, members of the Cosa Nostra had their own territory, code and hierarchy, a state within a state, so it was only natural they wanted their own uniform. The coppola was enough and it was perfect. Fifty years ago, virtually all Sicilian men had one, but mafia members wore it in a certain way. The peak could be tilted up or down, the brim straight or angled, the eyes revealed or hidden. It all meant something: rank, attitude or intent. Mafia experts agree that the organisation's triumph was to make itself of Sicily, to manipulate symbols and mould the essence of identity until Cosa Nostra and Sicily became indistinguishable. Writers and film-makers caught on. By the time the aptly named Francis Coppola made The Godfather, in 1972, Robert De Niro and Al Pacino were compelled to wear it. Friday's debut in Milan will be an attempt to reclaim history. Designers such as Gianfranco Ferr\u00e9, Krizia and Missoni have spurned payment to come up with a range of styles for children, men and women, using plastic, cotton, iron, felt, lace, denim, tweed and python skin. There is a wedding coppola, a waterproof coppola, a knitted coppola, a spouting volcano coppola, a perfumed coppola, a coppola with zips, a coppola with eyes and a tongue, a coppola with false chocolates. San Giuseppe Jato is 30km inland from Palermo, the island's capital. The higher the climb, the worse the road gets. Ears pop, the markings vanish, the surface turns gritty. Jato valley's greens and yellows sweep below, the mountain swirls into the clouds above. A heavy fog veils oncoming traffic, but Guido Agnello, wiry and chainsmoking, is in a hurry. It was his idea six years ago to reclaim the coppola; now it is near fruition, he is a ball of nervous energy. \"It must work! It will work!\" he says. He is president of the Palazzo Intelligente foundation, which has tapped European Union and United Nations funds for cultural and economic initiatives. For the coppola project, there was only one place to start, the village of tattered, two-storey concrete blocks looming from the mist. Symbolism and economics demanded it. This is the heartland of Costa Nostra, where 11 May Day picnickers were massacred in 1947, heralding an era of political assassination; where Bernardo Brusca and his son Giovanni masterminded their clan's carving up of contracts and rivals; where Baldassare Di Maggio opened a tomb to hide the two bazookas, two Kalashnikovs and two containers of plastic explosive intended for the mafia's greatest enemies: the judges Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, and the mayor of Palermo, Leoluca Orlando. The judges died in 1992, but the wave of revulsion that swept Sicily galvanised the state into doing something it should have done decades before: catch and jail Salvatore Riina, the boss of bosses. Cosa Nostra is not the force it was, but it endures, intimidating and corrupting. The women receiving the new rolls of cloth know all this, but for them the new coppola factory is about jobs and pay packets where before there were none. There are seven of them working at three tables placed at the end of an 800 sq metre plant. It is their job to train others in the art of cutting, sewing and stitching. \"My friends want to work here too,\" says Giulle Terese, 39. Another 80 women work from home, each making up to 50 caps and \u00a3130 per week. The caps return to the factory for ironing, finishing, boxing and loading. A designer, Lina Giarratana, studies the methods and will return to her town of Ragusa, on the other side of the island, where 100 women are waiting for orders. This was originally a plastics factory, but the owner, Giuseppe Taormina, gave the space and funding in exchange for 49% of the coppola profits.

That is just the kind of undesireable that the government's transport select committee might wish to eliminate with its new scheme. But evidence presented to the committee last September suggests that, if so, it could be targeting the wrong group. According to the new findings, your worst driving nightmare is more likely to be in his early to mid-20s, earning a good salary and wearing a suit.</p> <p>In general, drivers in their teens and 20s are twice as likely to be killed or seriously injured as thirtysomethings, and the risk for men is double that for women. If the government's recommendation is made law, the earliest you will be able to drive solo will be 18. With a year's experience under their belts, the thinking goes, young novices will cause less havoc on the roads.</p> <p>The proposed scheme is arguably unfair to women, who have a better road safety record, and to the less well-off who may be twiddling their thumbs for a year because they don't have access to a family car or long-suffering relative. But more importantly, it might leave untouched the real offenders who give young male drivers such a bad name. According to Dr Steve Stradling of the Transport Research Institute at Napier University in Edinburgh, who carried out the research, \"Boy Racer\" is something of a misnomer.</p> <p>He and his colleagues interviewed around 800 drivers and found that of those who had been penalised for speeding in the previous three years, or who admitted to a tendency to speed, most were men aged between 21 and 40. They are more likely to come from households with an annual income in excess of \u00a340,000, and they fall into the top socioeconomic brackets - A, B and C1. They tend to drive newer, more powerful cars (minimum engine size 1.8 litres), to live out of town and to clock up a large mileage - in excess of 20,000 miles a year. And the worst offenders are in the Midlands.</p> <p>Dr Stradling had expected to find the bulk of the problem in a younger, poorer sector of the population, with the predictable aftershock later on, among older drivers of company cars. But company cars account for only 8% of the British car fleet, and surveys of this kind have generally overlooked those whose work requires them to drive their own cars. Factor that in, he says, and it immediately becomes obvious that driving for work is a large part of the problem. One in three of those who drove every working day and drove more than 14,000 kilometres a year had been penalised for speeding.</p> <p>Speeding drivers are 50% more likely to have been involved in a crash than those who observe the limits, he says. Newly qualified drivers are undoubtedly a hazard, but the chances are they are driving smaller cars at lower speeds. A few years down the line, it's a different story. \"They will be driving a half-way decent motor, and they'll be driving a lot,\" he says. \"But they're still young enough to be suffering the effects of testosterone.\"</p> <p>Not everyone agrees. Professor John Groeger, a psychologist at the University of Surrey, is suspicious of any attempt to point the blame at young men, whatever car they drive. Right across the age range, he says, males drive between twice and three times as much as females do. They are inevitably at a higher risk of being involved in an accident. If you take mileage into account, there is actually very little difference in the accident rates between men and women under 20. \"I think there's a tendency to stigmatise certain groups,\" he says. \"As far as young men are concerned we're not seeing the whole picture.\" In terms of accidents, he adds, pen sioners are just as dangerous as young males - per mile covered.</p> <p>The Automobile Association does not yet recognise the phenomenon of the OAP Racer. But according to Andrew Howard, its head of road safety, it is concerned about what it sees as an attitude problem among young drivers, particularly young males, who seem to view driving as an expressive activity rather than a practical one. The last study it commissioned in this area was published in 1992, though Howard says its findings are still valid. Dr Roger Ingham of Southampton University and colleagues put 400 drivers under the age of 25 through a driving test to weed out the 27 safest and a similar number of the unsafest.</p> <p>The two groups were then put through a battery of tests that included asking them to define a good driver. It's worth noting that all the respondents picked from the initial cohort were male because there weren't enough unsafe female drivers to control for gender. And some of their answers were \"quite stunning\", says Howard. The safe drivers were more likely to define a good driver as one \"who gets from A to B without endangering himself or anybody else on the road,\" whereas an example of an unsafe driver's reply was, \"Someone who can control a car, who can stop suddenly, corner suddenly, knows what spaces he can go through . . . someone who's confident.\"</p> <p>Stewart, 22, who drives a Suzuki Vitara, faced possible prosecution by Thames Valley Police after a risky overtaking manoeuvre went wrong, resulting in a collision. He was offered a way out if he agreed to go on a two-day driver improvement course run by DriveTech UK, a company based at the Transport Research Laboratory in Crowthorne, Berkshire, last December. The course hasn't really changed his attitude to driving, he says, but then he never thought of himself as a bad driver. Among his peers, though, he admits that speed is a big attraction. \"We're pretty hairy drivers,\" he says, \"Fast approaches to roundabouts, that sort of thing.\"</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions says that one of the main aims of the select committee's recommendation is to cut the number of road deaths caused by young drivers. Andrew Howard is cautiously welcoming of it. Any measure that means drivers are more experienced when they first hit the road alone has to be a good thing, he says. The reality, however, is that the most dangerous drivers out there have the skills, they just choose not to use them. \"Much of the time this is because they want to impress their peer group,\" he says. So in the end, it's an attitude problem.</p>",

If the government's recommendation is made law, the earliest you will be able to drive solo will be 18. With a year's experience under their belts, the thinking goes, young novices will cause less havoc on the roads. The proposed scheme is arguably unfair to women, who have a better road safety record, and to the less well-off who may be twiddling their thumbs for a year because they don't have access to a family car or long-suffering relative. But more importantly, it might leave untouched the real offenders who give young male drivers such a bad name. According to Dr Steve Stradling of the Transport Research Institute at Napier University in Edinburgh, who carried out the research, \"Boy Racer\" is something of a misnomer. He and his colleagues interviewed around 800 drivers and found that of those who had been penalised for speeding in the previous three years, or who admitted to a tendency to speed, most were men aged between 21 and 40. They are more likely to come from households with an annual income in excess of \u00a340,000, and they fall into the top socioeconomic brackets - A, B and C1. They tend to drive newer, more powerful cars (minimum engine size 1.8 litres), to live out of town and to clock up a large mileage - in excess of 20,000 miles a year. And the worst offenders are in the Midlands. Dr Stradling had expected to find the bulk of the problem in a younger, poorer sector of the population, with the predictable aftershock later on, among older drivers of company cars. But company cars account for only 8% of the British car fleet, and surveys of this kind have generally overlooked those whose work requires them to drive their own cars. Factor that in, he says, and it immediately becomes obvious that driving for work is a large part of the problem. One in three of those who drove every working day and drove more than 14,000 kilometres a year had been penalised for speeding. Speeding drivers are 50% more likely to have been involved in a crash than those who observe the limits, he says. Newly qualified drivers are undoubtedly a hazard, but the chances are they are driving smaller cars at lower speeds. A few years down the line, it's a different story. \"They will be driving a half-way decent motor, and they'll be driving a lot,\" he says. \"But they're still young enough to be suffering the effects of testosterone.\" Not everyone agrees. Professor John Groeger, a psychologist at the University of Surrey, is suspicious of any attempt to point the blame at young men, whatever car they drive. Right across the age range, he says, males drive between twice and three times as much as females do. They are inevitably at a higher risk of being involved in an accident. If you take mileage into account, there is actually very little difference in the accident rates between men and women under 20. \"I think there's a tendency to stigmatise certain groups,\" he says. \"As far as young men are concerned we're not seeing the whole picture.\" In terms of accidents, he adds, pen sioners are just as dangerous as young males - per mile covered. The Automobile Association does not yet recognise the phenomenon of the OAP Racer. But according to Andrew Howard, its head of road safety, it is concerned about what it sees as an attitude problem among young drivers, particularly young males, who seem to view driving as an expressive activity rather than a practical one. The last study it commissioned in this area was published in 1992, though Howard says its findings are still valid. Dr Roger Ingham of Southampton University and colleagues put 400 drivers under the age of 25 through a driving test to weed out the 27 safest and a similar number of the unsafest. The two groups were then put through a battery of tests that included asking them to define a good driver. It's worth noting that all the respondents picked from the initial cohort were male because there weren't enough unsafe female drivers to control for gender. And some of their answers were \"quite stunning\", says Howard. The safe drivers were more likely to define a good driver as one \"who gets from A to B without endangering himself or anybody else on the road,\" whereas an example of an unsafe driver's reply was, \"Someone who can control a car, who can stop suddenly, corner suddenly, knows what spaces he can go through . . . someone who's confident.\" Stewart, 22, who drives a Suzuki Vitara, faced possible prosecution by Thames Valley Police after a risky overtaking manoeuvre went wrong, resulting in a collision. He was offered a way out if he agreed to go on a two-day driver improvement course run by DriveTech UK, a company based at the Transport Research Laboratory in Crowthorne, Berkshire, last December. The course hasn't really changed his attitude to driving, he says, but then he never thought of himself as a bad driver. Among his peers, though, he admits that speed is a big attraction. \"We're pretty hairy drivers,\" he says, \"Fast approaches to roundabouts, that sort of thing.\" A spokeswoman for the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions says that one of the main aims of the select committee's recommendation is to cut the number of road deaths caused by young drivers. Andrew Howard is cautiously welcoming of it. Any measure that means drivers are more experienced when they first hit the road alone has to be a good thing, he says. The reality, however, is that the most dangerous drivers out there have the skills, they just choose not to use them. \"Much of the time this is because they want to impress their peer group,\" he says. So in the end, it's an attitude problem.",

She refers without embarrassment to a sister called Wiggles. She herself has been in therapy, she says, \"for, like, years\".</p> <p>Susannah, 37 under those sulky brows, is much more guarded, more vulnerable. She spends a lot of time screwing a tissue into a hard ball. Her father, whose money came from shipping and property and who advised Thatcher, died three years ago; her older sister has been \"a mother and best friend\" to her. Susannah sobs a bit when she talks about this. A while ago, after a spell in fashion PR, and before she met Trinny (they were introduced by a mutual friend), she wrote a book about present-giving and there was a horrid article, in the Telegraph as it happens, saying she'd never done a day's work in her life. \"And, I'm not joking, it made me cry for a year.\" She says she's found the Linley thing hard to shake off. \"There's no doubt that it has helped open doors whatever, but it's still 'ex-girlfriend of . . .' It's, like, come on guys, it's 15 years.\"</p> <p>She lives in Battersea and Leicestershire with Sten Bertelsen, who launched Death cigarettes, and he is an \"amazing husband\" and an \"incredible father\" to their 14-month-old Joe. But she suffered from post-natal depression after the birth, with terrible panic attacks. \"I had only 10 days maternity leave which I would not do again.\" \"For everyone's sake,\" adds Trinny drily.</p> <p>Today, Susannah and Trinny, S&amp;T, will be taking their seats, like any other British style guru, at London Fashion Week. They'll have front row for Elspeth Gibson, who designed Trinny's wedding dress last year and who they \"lurve\". Alexander McQueen they don't reckon they'll even get into. Wherever they are, they'll be sitting together. It's a partnership, a double act, after all. It's the relationship that's the secret of their success. It's the relationship that's the brand. And it's less scary that way. \"I speak for both of us,\" says Susannah wincing, \"when I say that those sorts of people absolutely terrify us.\"</p> <p>Give or take the odd \"Dries\" or Joseph jacket, S&amp;T will stick with the high street. Stick with the shops. Stick with what suits. Get them on that and the tips come thick and fast. So, whatever you do, don't buy Tracy Feith florals. \"There's no difference and sometimes it is better cut in Warehouse,\" says Trinny. \"If you want to make your legs look a little bit thinner, buy bigger shoes,\" says Suse. And if you're pear-shaped, they both shriek, Morgan's for you. \"Great dresses with a ruffle like that, to the knee, with three-quarter sleeve which are fab,\" says Trin, who is still purring from a \"really weird olivey, sagey-green, chiffony thing\" she found in Hennes for 28 quid. And as for those enviable Marion Foale cardigans made for the petite out there, \"Burn them, burn them, burn them,\" says Trinny. \"M&amp;S do a copy which is exactly the same. And Marion Foale designs it. Anyway,\" she adds, sizing me up, \"they're too short-waisted for you and too knitty for your tits.\"</p> <p>Trinny puts her head on one side. \"I don't know,\" she says. \"You see these fashion pictures sometimes and there's a nipple and piece of chiffon and what is it telling you?

It provides Indian homeless children a home, food and a place to rest. </p> <p> <b> What's so special about the car?</b> </p> <p> It's a 1954 Fiat with a 1100 engine. A 50s car for a 50s girl and we're both in the same nick! The parts are Italian made and it was assembled in India. It's a precursor to the Panini taxi. Any car that's been designed to be a taxi has to be durable and reliable. It has a good engine but the bodywork isn't exactly waterproof. The Gujaratees call it a \"Dukkar\" which means pig. </p> <p> <b> What memories does it have?</b> </p> <p> Lots. I've had it for 5 years and couldn't bear to sell it. It would be like selling the pet dog. It's done a 1000 mile trip from Bombay to Bangalore - which are bad roads - and it didn't sneeze once. </p> <p> <b> Who will be your companion?</b> </p> <p> My step son Alexander. </p> <p> <b> What provisions will you take?</b> </p> <p> Lots of spares, tools, two spare tyres, tow rope, fire extinguisher. </p> <p> <b> Will you take any entertainment?</b> </p> <p> No - there's no need. I'll have Alexander to talk to and there'll be so much scenery to look at. </p> <p> <b> How long will it take you?</b> </p> <p> Two months. I'm hoping to be back in early May with a daily maximum of 250 miles - about five hours. </p> <p> <b> What scares you about the trip?</b> </p> <p> Not much. If I get stuck I have faith that the local people will help me. I believe in the fundamental goodness of man. I'll be very respectful of traditions and dress appropriately. </p> <p> <b> What routes will you take?</b> </p> <p> I'll go through Pakistan, Iran - Shiraz, Esfahan, Tabriz - crossing the border into Turkey, across the top of the Black Sea through the Turkish province of Cappadocia through to Troy and Istanbul.

      "bodyText": "Why are you doing this? To raise funds for a charity, Anchorage Shelters in Bombay (the UK version is Rescue a Child) which I became very attached to when I lived there. It provides Indian homeless children a home, food and a place to rest. What's so special about the car? It's a 1954 Fiat with a 1100 engine. A 50s car for a 50s girl and we're both in the same nick! The parts are Italian made and it was assembled in India. It's a precursor to the Panini taxi. Any car that's been designed to be a taxi has to be durable and reliable. It has a good engine but the bodywork isn't exactly waterproof. The Gujaratees call it a \"Dukkar\" which means pig. What memories does it have? Lots. I've had it for 5 years and couldn't bear to sell it. It would be like selling the pet dog. It's done a 1000 mile trip from Bombay to Bangalore - which are bad roads - and it didn't sneeze once. Who will be your companion? My step son Alexander. What provisions will you take? Lots of spares, tools, two spare tyres, tow rope, fire extinguisher. Will you take any entertainment? No - there's no need. I'll have Alexander to talk to and there'll be so much scenery to look at. How long will it take you? Two months. I'm hoping to be back in early May with a daily maximum of 250 miles - about five hours. What scares you about the trip? Not much. If I get stuck I have faith that the local people will help me. I believe in the fundamental goodness of man. I'll be very respectful of traditions and dress appropriately. What routes will you take? I'll go through Pakistan, Iran - Shiraz, Esfahan, Tabriz - crossing the border into Turkey, across the top of the Black Sea through the Turkish province of Cappadocia through to Troy and Istanbul. Then up the Dalmation coast through the Balkans which will be beautiful scenery, through Albania (although I'm not sure how safe that will be), then Slovenia, Italy, then France and home. Is there anything you don't like about the car? I hate the thought of it crumbling away some time. I wish it was new. What kind of driver are you? With this car, I'm very aware of its age so I'm gentle. If I was driving something more robust I would be speedy. Any bad habits when you're driving? I go for all the gaps. How will you keep in touch with people back home? I'll be emailing updates to my husband who can then keep everyone up to date. What will you do with the car afterwards? It'll have to have a strict MOT within 24 hours of arriving back in the UK. I'll give all the village school kids a ride - it'll be like a donkey at the village fare.",

But to me, the most sobering aspect of the recent spate of hacker attacks on major American corporate websites is that the offenders and their indirect accomplices appear close to being punished. </p> <p>Amazingly, at least among my friends and students, our initial reaction to news of the sabotage was one of perverse glee. We just couldn't repress our feelings, however illogical we knew them to be. </p> <p>Admit it: for one brief moment, the campaign of denial-of-service attacks brought a smile to your face. What could account for such widespread ambivalence about a clearly illegal and destructive campaign? Because it's refreshing, that's why. </p> <p>Over a few days last week, a rather simple programme temporarily paralysed the most established and profitable websites in the world. The attack programme worked by asking the target website for more information than it is capable of dispensing. </p> <p>With all its resources tied up, the website is forced to deny service to the millions of users who want access. The site goes down. </p> <p>This digital Molotov cocktail was distributed widely on hacker bulletin boards, so the perpetrator could be anyone, or even different hackers working independently. First, they incapacitated the most popular website in the world, the Yahoo search engine, which went down for hours as engineers struggled to restore order. Then they hit Amazon, CNN, eBay and buy.com. </p> <p>These are not randomly chosen websites. The hackers didn't attack schools, charities or communities. They attacked commerce.

      "bodyText": "I know it's wrong. But to me, the most sobering aspect of the recent spate of hacker attacks on major American corporate websites is that the offenders and their indirect accomplices appear close to being punished. Amazingly, at least among my friends and students, our initial reaction to news of the sabotage was one of perverse glee. We just couldn't repress our feelings, however illogical we knew them to be. Admit it: for one brief moment, the campaign of denial-of-service attacks brought a smile to your face. What could account for such widespread ambivalence about a clearly illegal and destructive campaign? Because it's refreshing, that's why. Over a few days last week, a rather simple programme temporarily paralysed the most established and profitable websites in the world. The attack programme worked by asking the target website for more information than it is capable of dispensing. With all its resources tied up, the website is forced to deny service to the millions of users who want access. The site goes down. This digital Molotov cocktail was distributed widely on hacker bulletin boards, so the perpetrator could be anyone, or even different hackers working independently. First, they incapacitated the most popular website in the world, the Yahoo search engine, which went down for hours as engineers struggled to restore order. Then they hit Amazon, CNN, eBay and buy.com. These are not randomly chosen websites. The hackers didn't attack schools, charities or communities. They attacked commerce. Why? Those of us who were enjoying the internet back in the 80s and early 90s remember a time when this technology was about communication. Businesses weren't even allowed on the net. In those days, the interactive media space felt like a cross between a college campus and the Wild West.

The net didn't seem like a particularly safe place - but since when are revolutions safe? The introduction of business to the internet changed all that.

The bad news is that the treasury and the Bank of England believe that it is too good to be true. </p> <p>This sense of foreboding explains why the Bank's monetary policy committee nudged up rates for the fourth time in six months last week, and it explains why Gordon Brown was standing in the shadows applauding while they did so. Don't get me wrong. There is nothing the chancellor would like more than to have the jobless total down to 500,000, but nagging away at the back of his mind is the fear that if unemployment continues to fall it may only be because the economy is growing excessively fast. </p> <p>This, of course, is precisely what happened at the end of the 1980s. Unemployment fell impressively between 1986 and early 1990, but the decline was illusory because the Lawson boom was unsustainable. Any fool can bring down unemployment or make the public finances look good when growth is running at 4% or 5% a year, but in the end there is a reckoning. That is what Brown wants to avoid at all costs. </p> <p>The idea, however, that Britain is in the midst of a second Lawson boom is preposterous. In 1985-1988 the economy grew by 4.4% a year, well in excess of any estimate of its long-term potential. In 1996-1999, it expanded by 2.5% a year, bang in line with the treasury's view of its trend growth rate. Over the same period, the unemployment claimant count has halved to 1.16m and inflation has fallen. </p> <p>All this is rather baffling to the Bank and the treasury. Taking just one example at random, the Bank's inflation report of August 1998 expressed concern about the growth in earnings which it said suggested \"that unemployment is more clearly below its natural rate than was then [three months earlier] thought\". With the national minimum wage due to kick in the following spring, the bank said that in the short-term earnings growth would accelerate still further. \"But in the medium term, there is likely to be a rise in unemployment, reflecting a period of below-trend output growth, that brings down earnings growth before the two-year forecast horizon.\" </p> <p>It is unfair to pick on the Bank alone. One of the more august City firms was forecasting that unemployment would have to rise by 500,000 to keep inflation in check. The treasury's fiscal arithmetic, likewise, is predicated on unemployment some half a million higher than its present level. None of the numbers spewing out of econometric models seems to relate to the real world. </p> <p>For those of us who believe that the three witches from Macbeth would have a better chance of forecasting the economy correctly than an econometrician, this hardly comes as a surprise. For policymakers in the UK, on the other hand, it is a bit troubling since they all believe in the concept known as the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment, developed in Britain in the 1980s by Richard Layard, Steve Nickell and Richard Jackman. </p> <p>Central to the idea of Nairu was that demand alone would not cure unemployment, especially long-term unemployment, and that there were supply- side problems - the structure of wage bargaining, the level of benefits - that prevented the attainment of full employment. Any attempt to push unemployment below the Nairu using macro- economic policy would lead to higher inflation. The key was microeconomic measures to deal with structural impediments to job creation. </p> <p>This seemed to fit neatly with life as it was in the late 1980s, but in Britain and US the theory has been discredited by events of the 1990s. The main problem is that it tends to move all over the place. When unemployment was around 10%, the Nairu was thought to be around 8%; now that unemployment is around 4%, the Nairu is thought to be around 5% to 6%. As unemployment has come down so have the estimates of the Nairu, which makes it useless in the conduct of monetary policy, even as an intermediate target. </p> <p>In the US, Alan Greenspan has recognised this, and has stopped worrying where the Nairu is or whether it exists at all. He has kept demand robust, constantly but gradually pushing unemployment down and taken a risk that inflation would not start to rise. So far, his approach has been vindicated. </p> <p>One way for the circle to be squared would be if the Nairu had been lowered by extensive supply-side reforms during the 1990s, but in neither Britain nor the US has this been the case. Most of the micro changes took place in the 1980s but still did not prevent unemployment from rising sharply in the early 1990s. Labour-market rigidities have not diminished in the 1990s; on the contrary, to a modest extent they have increased, especially in the UK, where the introduction of the minimum wage and the legislation making it easier for unions to organise should have theoretically raised the level of the Nairu. </p> <p>In these circumstances, it is fascinating that Nickell - one of the godfathers of the Nairu - has now been appointed to the MPC. As an acknowledged expert in the workings of the labour market, he is just the man to explain why the Nairu has seemingly gone on the blink. </p> <p><strong> Less useful</strong><br> </p> <p> One possible theory is that it was developed for a particular and highly unusual period and is now less useful as a policy tool. Western economies suffered from two severe oil shocks in the 1970s, and the determination to combat inflation resulted in a prolonged period of contractionary economic policies. Unemployment that would have been short-term in more normal circumstances became ingrained. </p> <p>But if the 1980s were exceptional, policies that were inappropriate then might be perfectly appropriate now. The facts seem to suggest that unemployment can come down quite a long way without reigniting inflation and that the right amount of macroeconomic expansion can create jobs, even for those who were seen as unemployable five or 10 years ago. It is possible that the global economy has reverted to a more normal pattern, with generally low in flation combined with much lower levels of unemployment. Indeed, there may be nothing wrong with the allegedly sclerotic economies of Germany and France that a decade of robust expansion would not put right. </p> <p>So what are the prospects for a new golden age, for the high and stable level of employment that the chancellor said was his goal on the day he gave the Bank operational independence? Given the right mix of economic policies, not bad. That does not mean abandoning all supply-side reforms in favour of a wild dash for growth, nor that the Bank is always wrong to raise rates, but that structural reforms have to be embedded in the right macroeconomic policies. </p> <p>Naturally, a more complete understanding of what is happening in the labour market would help deliver this, since it would prevent the MPC from crossing the line between being pre-emptive and trigger happy.

      "body": "<p>It seems an unlikely tale now, but there was a time when the Royal Opera House made headlines for its on-stage events and not just for its seemingly endless roll call of off-stage disasters. The return on Friday to Covent Garden of Romanian soprano Angela Gheorghiu provides a timely reminder in physical form of the way things used to be - at least occasionally. </p> <p>Gheorghiu is singing opposite her husband Roberto Alagna, \"the fourth tenor\", in Gounod's sumptuously romantic reworking of Shakespeare, Rom\u00e9o et Juliette. The couple's earlier recording of the work has been highly praised and the production has been the quickest sell-out since the opera house reopened in December. But while both public and critical acclaim is widely anticipated, it is safe to say that it will not match the intensity of response afforded a previous Gheorghiu performance on the same stage. </p> <p>In 1994 the relatively unknown singer was cast as the doomed courtesan Violetta by Sir Georg Solti in Richard Eyre's staging of La Traviata. There was already something of an industry buzz building around the young lyric soprano but even Solti - who admitted to having cried when he first heard her sing - was unprepared for the ultimate impact she would make. Just a few days into rehearsals everything changed. Solti took the virtually unheard of step of abandoning a commitment to record the work six months later with a different cast and persuaded his record company that it should be done there and then with Gheorghiu. He then called the BBC to invite the director general Michael Checkland and the controller of BBC2, Alan Yentob, to the first night. They followed Solti's example and cleared both the BBC2 and Radio 3 schedules. La Traviata was broadcast live the following Saturday evening to an audience of 1.5m. The people's opera indeed. </p> <p>Jeremy Isaacs was general director of the ROH at the time. \"You only get one chance in life to hurtle through barriers and make yourself a star and she seized it so unerringly that one was left gasping in admiration. There are all sorts of moments in the history of the artistic world when you think, 'I wish I had been there when that happened'. That was one of those nights.\" </p> <p>But while Gheorghiu's emerging talent had catapulted her out of the narrow focus of the opera world and into the cultural mainstream, it was developments in her private life that pushed her celebrity into a new dimension. It was during the run of La Traviata that she had embarked on an affair with Alagna, who had been widowed a few months earlier aged only 31. Gheorghiu obtained a divorce from her husband in Romania and the couple married in 1996. In what sounds like a scene from a publicist's dream the ceremony was conducted by the mayor of New York while the pair were in the city starring opposite each other as lovers in Puccini's perennial tearjerker La Boh\u00e8me at the Met. </p> <p>The Alagnas had become opera's golden couple and seemed determined to take full advantage of it. They switched agent to the same man who represented Charles Aznavour and Liza Minnelli, and engaged the same New York publicist that handled Pavarotti. But in an industry where being difficult is hardly a novelty, their increasingly demanding approach soon became a source of worried comment. </p> <p>At Covent Garden they were called \"the Ceausescus\", and Gheorghiu was dubbed \"La Petite Draculette\" at the Bastille opera in Paris. Jonathan Miller, who worked with them both separately, resisted national stereotyping and settled instead for Bonnie and Clyde - although to be fair, he also said that while he was expecting big trouble from Gheorghiu, he got very little. But while the old joke about the difference between a soprano and a terrorist - you can negotiate with a terrorist - still has a certain chilly comic resonance, recently there has been a drying up of Gheorghiu horror stories. </p> <p>Whether singing opposite Alagna or on her own, the body of work she has produced is remarkable. Their recording of Puccini's La Rondine was Gramophone magazine's 1997 record of the year, Duets and Arias sold over 200,000 copies, and she recently triumphed in the ambitious role of Charlotte in a new recording of Massenet's Werther. Her steadily growing stage repertoire includes L'Elisir d'Amore, Turandot and L'Amico Fritz. </p> <p>The conductor Antonio Pappano, the next music director at Covent Garden, has worked with her since 1993 when he took her sight unseen for a production of Carmen. \"Then I heard her voice and that was that,\" he says. \"The next thing she was mega. In the recording studio I've never heard a voice so seductive to the microphone. Through very subtle inflection and colour she can convey very complex thoughts and emotions. She is innately musical and that transmits itself in recordings.\" </p> <p>It all seems a long way from a childhood in Ceausescu's Romania in the 60s, where she grew up in a family that not only had no musical tradition, but no interest whatsoever in singing. \"Not even la la la,\" she now laughs. </p> <p>The Burlacu family - Gheorghiu is her first husband's name - lived in the small town of Adjud, 300km from Bucharest in the northern Romanian province of Moldavia. Her father was a train conductor and her mother a housewife. In this unprepossessing environment Angela and her younger sister Elena were from the beginning something of a local phenomenon. \"We didn't have normal voices. Before I started school I sang with this voice. It was always sort of operatic.\" </p> <p>But while the sisters' talent had come as a surprise to the family, there was never any doubt how it would be utilised. They performed in local concerts singing arias and lieder, and when Angela was 14 she was sent to the Liceu de Arte, a music school in Bucharest. Elena soon followed her. </p> <p>Gheorghiu says that from the beginning it was clear to her, to her parents and her teachers that both girls' future would be as professional singers. \"It was never like a dream for us,\" she says, \"it was just the way it would be. It was so obvious.\" </p> <p> But the sudden death in 1996 of her sister Elena in \"an accident\" when aged only 30 put paid to that dream. Gheorghiu moved on to the senior music academy in Bucharest when she was 18. It was while there that she married Andr\u00e9 Gheorghiu. She kept his name after they divorced on the advice of her record company. Contrary to the popular myth - that she dumped her plumber husband for Alagna when her career took off - Andr\u00e9 was in fact an engineer from an important musical family in Romania. </p> <p>Gheorghiu herself pestered the authorities constantly for permission to travel abroad to enter competitions but without success. \"While we were privileged in a way, they never even answered me even to say no. It was awful. But I finished the academy just at the right time. The revolution was in December 1989 and I graduated in 1990.\" </p> <p>In fact Gheorghiu was one of the first Romanians to directly benefit from Ceausescu's overthrow. While it was still \"boom booming\" in Bucharest she took a phone call from a Romanian impresario working out of Frankfurt, who asked her to a recital for Dutch television. </p> <p>Luisa Petrov had seen a video of Gheorghiu performing in Bucharest and says, \"From the first moment it was obvious that she was a big talent. With other young singers you try to get them into small houses, but I sent Angela straight to Covent Garden. I was that convinced.\" </p> <p>Following Petrov's prompting, Peter Katona, director of casting at the Royal Opera, invited Gheorghiu for an audition. \"She sang three arias and I said, 'That's it, we'll do something',\" says Katona. So despite having virtually no stage experience she made her debut at Covent Garden as Zerlina in Don Giovanni in February 1992. Alongside her was another young singer whose career also subsequently took off, Bryn Terfel. </p> <p>Later that year Katona cast her in a production of La Boh\u00e8me, where she first met Alagna, and then in Massanet's Cherubin, Carmen and Turandot where, in a piece of information that may come in handy for operatic trivia quizes, she shared the stage with the prime minister's son, Euan Blair, who as a 13 year old was a member of the children's chorus. </p> <p>Richard Eyre went to Vienna to meet her and remembers her as something of an innocent, in that she had never originated a role in a major opera house. But he was still struck by her strong sense of her own destiny. \"She was almost like the Dalai Lama; this girl from a small town in Romania with such a pure instinct for music - it was if she had been selected by fate. She does have a voice that can only be described as God-given. The way she acted and sang that part were indivisible. It wasn't quite artless energy, but there was an unbridled enthusiasm. As an actress she hadn't learnt to dissemble.\" </p> <p>Gheorghiu relished the idea of the project being Solti's first Traviata, her first Traviata and Eyre's first opera. The combination produced a superstar. \"When I tell people it was entirely normal and expected they don't believe me. But that's how it felt. I never felt for one second of my life that I would not be here now, that I would do something else. Everybody has said all my life that I would be a singer.\" </p> <p>Pappano says that she is of course outspoken, \"but if you're going to put a stamp on something that's what happens.\" He remembers an evening with the couple - \"watching Jurassic Park in French on Roberto's big-screen TV\" - when they laughed at all the names they are called by the press, \"all the Ceausescus and Bonnie and Clyde stuff. I thought it was so healthy because you could take that to heart and let it destroy you.\" </p> <p>Pappano is convinced there is more to come from Gheorghiu. \"When, as in the preparation of an opera, you have a bunch of very competent and confident people in one room, it is rare for there to be one person with the power. She has such innate musicality, a beautiful voice and feel for opera in her bones that you must respect what she contributes. You can't just say, 'That's a bunch of crap'. But if you are aware of what she has to offer, and balance that with your ideas, then it works just fine. When it comes together it is worth everything. When everybody puts the best of themselves in to something - my God, it is fantastic. And Angela is not only capable of giving the best of herself, she actually goes out there and does it.\" </p> <p>\u0095Rom\u00e9o et Juliette, Royal Opera House, London WC2 (0171-304 4000), opens on Friday February 18 at 7pm.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It seems an unlikely tale now, but there was a time when the Royal Opera House made headlines for its on-stage events and not just for its seemingly endless roll call of off-stage disasters. The return on Friday to Covent Garden of Romanian soprano Angela Gheorghiu provides a timely reminder in physical form of the way things used to be - at least occasionally. Gheorghiu is singing opposite her husband Roberto Alagna, \"the fourth tenor\", in Gounod's sumptuously romantic reworking of Shakespeare, Rom\u00e9o et Juliette. The couple's earlier recording of the work has been highly praised and the production has been the quickest sell-out since the opera house reopened in December. But while both public and critical acclaim is widely anticipated, it is safe to say that it will not match the intensity of response afforded a previous Gheorghiu performance on the same stage. In 1994 the relatively unknown singer was cast as the doomed courtesan Violetta by Sir Georg Solti in Richard Eyre's staging of La Traviata. There was already something of an industry buzz building around the young lyric soprano but even Solti - who admitted to having cried when he first heard her sing - was unprepared for the ultimate impact she would make. Just a few days into rehearsals everything changed. Solti took the virtually unheard of step of abandoning a commitment to record the work six months later with a different cast and persuaded his record company that it should be done there and then with Gheorghiu. He then called the BBC to invite the director general Michael Checkland and the controller of BBC2, Alan Yentob, to the first night.

      "body": "<p>One of my earliest memories is of sitting on the floor of Mike Leigh's living room in north Manchester in the days when his family lived above his GP father's surgery. I was one of a group of children watching a puppet show written, produced and directed by Mike Leigh - or, as he would now no doubt phrase it, \"devised and directed by Mike Leigh\". </p> <p>Mike's parents had known my parents since their teenage years in the 30s, when they had met in the Jewish youth movement Habonim. Mike and my brother Geoffrey also joined Habonim in due course. I was excused the Zionist propaganda and endless Israeli folk music on the grounds that I supported Manchester City and had therefore suffered enough. </p> <p>The Leighs and the Shindlers formed part of a tightly knit group of a dozen or so Jewish families who remained loyally close until death eventually reduced their ranks. Today my father and Mike's mother Phyllis are two of the few who remain. </p> <p>In this community the course of our lives was clearly marked out: primary school, 11 plus, one of the three grammar schools, university (probably Manchester or Leeds). Then into the professions (solicitor - there were few Jewish barristers - doctor, dentist, accountant), marriage, children, grandchildren, a seat in the synagogue by the eastern wall and presumably (though this wasn't emphasised), death. </p> <p>Mike was the first to make the break for ideological freedom. I remember when the news reached our house that he was leaving Salford grammar school not for university but to study acting at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. A shiver ran down my spine. London, acting, the theatre: the possibilities of romance and glamour were endless. </p> <p>This departure ended the embryonic artistic partnership of Mike Leigh and Geoffrey Shindler. When not engaged upon Habonim business they wrote articles for Punch, words by Shindler, cartoons by Leigh. They were much influenced by WS Gilbert and his Bab Ballads (his nascent anti-semitism notwithstanding), my brother endeavouring to echo Gilbert's satire, Mike inspired by Gilbert's bold drawings. </p> <p>To us the Leigh house was a haven of artistic sophistication in the bleak north Manchester of the 50s. Lining the walls were framed cartoons of actors who had appeared at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford. But the cement that joined us was Gilbert &amp; Sullivan. </p> <p>For six weeks every spring the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company took over the Opera House in Manchester and performed, as in a religious ritual, the entire canon of Savoy operas. The annual anticipation never wavered throughout my childhood and the first announcement of the schedule was rapidly devoured. Pirates, Pinafore, Patience, The Mikado, The Gondoliers, Ruddigore, Iolanthe and The Yeomen: the meal never varied and neither did the satisfaction. Princess Ida was the last of the Savoy operas to be revived after the war because the sets and costumes had been destroyed in the Blitz. The Leighs and the Shindlers eagerly seized upon it. Is it pure coincidence that Topsy-Turvy begins with the opening night of Princess Ida? </p> <p>We believed the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company to be our friends. We knew the apostolic line of succession from George Grossmith to John Reed in order categorical, as the Major General would have said. I remember Mike telling me years later of his pleasure in finally meeting Reed, a quiet, inoffensive Liverpudlian most unlike the boastful cowardly roles we had observed him playing from the upper circle. </p> <p>They were all our friends. Ann Drummond Grant who played the Katisha and Little Buttercup parts; Darrell Fancourt, the bass baritone who played the Mikado, the inheritor of the parts played by Timothy Spall in Topsy-Turvy; Thomas Round; Alan Styler; Donald Adams and Joyce Wright; even the gleaming bald pate of the conductor Isidore Godfrey: they came every year at the time of Passover and made the same gestures and spoke the same lines. From Seder Night to Titipu the ritual was comforting and unchanging. </p> <p>By far the most worrying development in the late 50s was the approaching end of D'Oyly Carte's copyright. Gilbert had died in 1911 and 50 years thereafter the copyright on his works was due to expire. In 1962 Sadler's Wells came to Manchester with a new version of Iolanthe. The Lord Chancellor still collapsed at the end of the nightmare patter song and the chorus of Peers still married the chorus of overweight fairies. The world didn't come to an end but for the D'Oyly Carte, which had enshrined Gilbert's 19th century production values in holy writ, life would never be the same again. </p> <p>For years now it has been a social stigma to hum a few bars of \"The flowers that bloom in the spring tra-la\", as if it conferred immediate membership of the Conservative party. This would come as a big surprise to my late Uncle Laurence, who presented to me his 1939 edition of the complete Savoy operas just before he stopped speaking to me for ever. Laurence Weidberg was a key figure in the Socialist party of Great Britain and the scourge of the Manchester Guardian for its wishy-washy left of centre political views and its refusal to hire him as their cricket correspondent just because he ran a raincoat factory. Laurence knew every line of every song Gilbert &amp; Sullivan ever wrote. He made me learn phonetically the complete lyrics of \"I am the very model of a modern major general\" at the age of seven, which did wonders for my appreciation of the English language but very little for my street cred in primary school. Laurence knew that Gilbert was another true subversive. Parliament, the class system, the navy, the law, the monarchy and the artistic pretensions of Victorian society all came in for Gilbert's withering scorn and Laurence's approval. It was only later that I discovered Gilbert was just as much a part of the establishment as the institutions he was satirising. </p> <p>I think Uncle Laurence would have approved of Topsy-Turvy. It contains the right amount of corrective to the uncritical sanitised versions of the story we have seen and heard in previous years. Jim Broadbent restores Gilbert to the towering and frequently dislikeable figure of historical reality. Gilbert &amp; Sullivan must not be allowed to become the exclusive property of the blue rinse brigade who follow the show with the score on their laps. So give three cheers and one cheer more for Topsy-Turvy as for Pinafore. </p> <p>\u0095Colin Shindler's autobiography Manchester United Ruined My Life is published by Headline at \u00a35.99.

Ann Drummond Grant who played the Katisha and Little Buttercup parts; Darrell Fancourt, the bass baritone who played the Mikado, the inheritor of the parts played by Timothy Spall in Topsy-Turvy; Thomas Round; Alan Styler; Donald Adams and Joyce Wright; even the gleaming bald pate of the conductor Isidore Godfrey: they came every year at the time of Passover and made the same gestures and spoke the same lines. From Seder Night to Titipu the ritual was comforting and unchanging. By far the most worrying development in the late 50s was the approaching end of D'Oyly Carte's copyright. Gilbert had died in 1911 and 50 years thereafter the copyright on his works was due to expire. In 1962 Sadler's Wells came to Manchester with a new version of Iolanthe. The Lord Chancellor still collapsed at the end of the nightmare patter song and the chorus of Peers still married the chorus of overweight fairies. The world didn't come to an end but for the D'Oyly Carte, which had enshrined Gilbert's 19th century production values in holy writ, life would never be the same again. For years now it has been a social stigma to hum a few bars of \"The flowers that bloom in the spring tra-la\", as if it conferred immediate membership of the Conservative party. This would come as a big surprise to my late Uncle Laurence, who presented to me his 1939 edition of the complete Savoy operas just before he stopped speaking to me for ever. Laurence Weidberg was a key figure in the Socialist party of Great Britain and the scourge of the Manchester Guardian for its wishy-washy left of centre political views and its refusal to hire him as their cricket correspondent just because he ran a raincoat factory. Laurence knew every line of every song Gilbert &amp; Sullivan ever wrote. He made me learn phonetically the complete lyrics of \"I am the very model of a modern major general\" at the age of seven, which did wonders for my appreciation of the English language but very little for my street cred in primary school. Laurence knew that Gilbert was another true subversive. Parliament, the class system, the navy, the law, the monarchy and the artistic pretensions of Victorian society all came in for Gilbert's withering scorn and Laurence's approval. It was only later that I discovered Gilbert was just as much a part of the establishment as the institutions he was satirising. I think Uncle Laurence would have approved of Topsy-Turvy. It contains the right amount of corrective to the uncritical sanitised versions of the story we have seen and heard in previous years. Jim Broadbent restores Gilbert to the towering and frequently dislikeable figure of historical reality. Gilbert &amp; Sullivan must not be allowed to become the exclusive property of the blue rinse brigade who follow the show with the score on their laps. So give three cheers and one cheer more for Topsy-Turvy as for Pinafore. \u0095Colin Shindler's autobiography Manchester United Ruined My Life is published by Headline at \u00a35.99. Topsy-Turvy is released on Friday.",

Terry Gilliam liked the noisy cascade of water that emanated from the ladies lavatory during soliloquies: it brought a touch of reality, he would say, to the make-believe world of theatre. Five years ago, it was derided by the Times for being so tatty, and celebrated by the New York Times as the finest theatre in the world. Welcome to the Royal Court theatre in London's Sloane Square. </p> <p>Few audiences or critics have ever doubted that the Royal Court has produced some of the finest new plays of the 20th century; but the building, first opened in 1888, was wobbly from the start. By 1995 it was on the way to being downright dangerous. The health and safety people were on the case. </p> <p>Enter the lottery and an \u00a318.8m grant via the Arts Council that, along with donations from the Jerwood foundation and private donors, enabled the Royal Court's English Stage Company, under the artistic direction of Stephen Daldry, to rebuild the Victorian theatre from top to toe. </p> <p>The results are superb. Because the old building was in such a parlous state, Daldry and his architects, Steve Tomkins and Graham Howarth, decided to reconstruct it in an imaginative way, so that it's often hard to tell what's old and what's new. The depth of texture is delicious. The Royal Court has been transformed into a dreamlike world, an architectural magic-lantern show. It's a greasepaint realm of shadows and half-light, a Famous Five experience of secret stairs and narrow passageways, of sudden views of the stage, of unexpected vistas across dressing-room terraces of the rooftops of Kensington and across to the urban theatre of the Palace of Westminster, Westminster cathedral and the London Eye. </p> <p>As for the auditorium, it has to be one of the best. A tight, high space crowded under a dome that disappears into ethereal darkness, its balconies lit so quietly that we might be back in the world of gaslight, its creak-free seats sheathed in warm leather. The armrests fold up so more people can be crowded in if necessary, or if you want to sit a little more cosily than you do in most theatres. </p> <p>It's hard not to rave about the Royal Court, especially if you remember coming here on summer evenings and, despite the quality of performances, wishing with the noise, people and heat that you hadn't. The theatre is now air-conditioned, the balcony bar is a treat and, although the building is still squeezed, Jersey Lily style, into its corsetted site next door to Sloane Square tube station, it's a delight to promenade through. </p> <p>And not just for the audience. Actors will be astonished by the graceful new dressing rooms, rehearsal room, meeting room and distinctive lavatories that are cleverly arranged, Rubik's Cube fashion, in new extensions added by Tomkins and Howarth at the back of the building. </p> <p>What you get, throughout the old parts of the building, is a Victorian feel without any of the frills of the century-old theatre that has been restored in \"authentic period style\" to within an inch of its life. The trouble with such restorations is that they are always too squeakily clean, overlit and somehow antiseptic. You rarely get the sensation in restored theatres, nor in over-scaled modern theatres, of the darkness, intimacy, sensuality and even danger that the world of make-believe needs if it's to transport an audience convincingly from the world. </p> <p>Bennett's near death experience aside, the Royal Court has long courted danger artistically and been faced by danger without asking for it. Opened in 1888, its first heyday began in 1904 when inspired impresarios Harry Granville-Barker and John Vedrenne started to show untried and untested new plays by the likes of Yeats, Ibsen, Galsworthy and Shaw. </p> <p>Too good to last? Perhaps, for by 1932 the Royal Court was a cinema. In 1940 it was blitzed. The London Theatre Guild pieced it together by 1952, and in 1955 George Devine and Tony Richardson began operating the English Stage Company from this physically uncertain base. The show went on - radical, experimental, a launch-pad for young playwrights, actors and directors - until the beginning of 1996. Which is when Daldry, backed by his trustees, began to rebuild the theatre with the young architects chosen through competition; the work has taken four years. </p> <p>This might seem a long time, but the site is very difficult to work in. The Royal Court occupies a particularly restricted space, hemmed in by the tube station, Toni &amp; Guy's (the hairdressers), the District and Circle line tracks that slice diagonally through its basement, crawling traffic, and, at the back, by what in the romantic imagination is the River Bourne coursing to the Serpentine, but what is today, more prosaically, one of London's major sewer outlets. This flows through a Roman-style Victorian brick tunnel behind the Royal Court before passing over the tracks and platforms of the station in a giant cast-iron tube. </p> <p>It might well have been easier to knock the whole thing down and start again. Yet what Daldry and all involved wanted was to keep something of the atmosphere and fabric of the old theatre, to retain and even enhance the warm embrace of its interior. This hasn't meant simply restoring old and battered decoration: they haven't. It's the feeling they've worked on. The truly clever thing about the architects' work is that this feeling pervades the whole theatre, from the front door through to the new extensions at the back. </p> <p>The basement has been dug out and now reaches to the underused traffic island of Sloane Square itself; this cavernous space is the Royal Court's new cafe and restaurant. It's open to the public, theatre-going or not, 12 hours a day. Like the rest of the theatre it is richly textured. The architects have stripped back the old theatre walls and left ducts and wires, sections of I-beams, iron panels and sockets on view. </p> <p>Exposed Victorian ironwork combines with semi-dark lighting and secretive passageways to lend the newly remodelled theatre the feel of Captain Nemo's Nautilus. Virtually every detail is special and appropriate. Here's a crank to wind open the untreated steel shutters that protect views in and out of the changing rooms; the device might equally raise or lower a safety curtain. Here's an adjustable reading lamp that would be equally at home in a film set by Caro and Jeunet, creators of Delicatessen and The City of Lost Children. </p> <p>Hidden away in the roof of the building is another small theatre. This eyrie of an auditorium is to be used, as it was, for new plays by untested playwrights as well as for monologues and performances that benefit from being enacted in an intimate atmosphere. The way up to this attic theatre is special. It's reached by a winding stair with dark-painted tongue-and-groove panelling that makes you feel as if you're on a childhood adventure into the roof of an old house, where aged teddy bears sit forlornly alongside long-forgotten rocking horses and abandoned clockwork train sets. The dressing-up box is somewhere up there; so, perhaps, is Alice's looking glass and even the tall cupboard that leads to Narnia. This atmosphere is achieved entirely by suggestion, prompted by the way space here is theatrically manipulated. </p> <p>Daldry and the Royal Court team appear to have thrown away the architectural rule-book. The new-look Royal Court is, despite intelligent new interventions by Tomkins and Howarth, as far removed from the run-of-the-mill of lofty, all too airy, multi-purpose lottery cultural venues (and there will be plenty of these yawning our way this spring) as Cathleen ni Houlihan is from Cats.

This in turn can lead to lack of motivation, anxiety and bitterness. Indeed, Page's departure is reported to have been badly received among the Dome's staff, who were fiercely loyal to her and received similar loyalty in return. </p> <p>Management consultancy firm Collinson Grant Consultants found that of the companies polled for its latest survey, 82% had restructured during the past five years, and three-quarters admitted to experiencing unrest among staff. Many of the companies reported that it was not unusual for staff to become antagonistic, with worryingly large numbers leaving as a result. </p> <p>Restructuring is particularly bad news for support staff. As Baron says, \"They know all too well that secretaries are usually the first to go when downsizing is on the cards. If that isn't bad enough, they often have to cope with their colleagues' worries. After all, most staff assume that secretaries know everything that is going on because they are most likely to be 'in' on the relevant meetings and have access to the relevant documents. They tend to hassle the secretaries for the lowdown even when the secretaries don't know a thing.\" </p> <p>Marilyn Davidson, organisational psychologist at the university of Manchester institute of science and technology (UMIST), adds: \"In a climate where job insecurity is high, employees get more frustrated than ever at rumours about downsizing.

They expect - rightfully - that at the very least, you should be able to point them in the right direction for whatever information is available.\" </p> <p>Elaine Carter, a careers adviser, believes that the secretary's first course of action should be to point this out to managers. Even in cases where the rumours turn out to be nothing more than idle gossip invented by bored employees, the importance of communication should not be underestimated. \"There is evidence to suggest that the absenteeism and inquisitions resulting from a rumoured, or badly communicated, company reorganisation can increase the PA's workload three fold. Knowing this will almost certainly kickstart bosses into responding.\" </p> <p>Of those companies that have recognised the benefits of communication, the most successful have set up a communications planning team, reports Collinson Grant. Invariably, a manager leads the team, and additional members include personnel and support staff. The primary objective is to deal with unhelpful rumours, but other potential problems such as stress-related illness and lower productivity should also be taken into consideration. Collinson Grant found that this can triple employers' chances of achieving all their goals and improve staff commitment by up to a quarter. </p> <p>At Bass Brewers and Vertex Data Science, two companies that have faced restructuring, an intranet system was set up. Other companies opt for more traditional methods of communication such as weekly - and if necessary, daily - team briefings. But written communication, it seems, is not the best way forward - 40% of employers interviewed by Collinson Grant have a written communications policy, but half think most staff have never read it. </p> <p>Email and one-to-one meetings in person, according to the communication experts, have become the best ways of imparting information, with most employees claiming they are far superior to a telephone conversation. </p> <p>\"Even if you don't end up having a formal team to discuss the best way of communicating with staff, regular meetings with the manager enable secretaries to go back to the office knowing exactly what they are at liberty to disclose, who they can refer concerned employees to for further information, and when the next public instalment is due,\" says Carter. </p> <p>Tales of appalling management are rife. Consider the real-life case of the chief executive who looked for a feel-good way of showing staff they were valued during a period of restructuring. In a flash of inspiration, he organised an office party. \"Enjoy yourselves,\" he told employees during a brief speech at the start of the evening. \"And don't worry about the redundancies.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The Commons has got back to business after last month's murder of Andrew Pennington, assistant to MP Nigel Jones. Among themselves MPs' staff murmured. Though all were appalled, none was surprised. All of us had tales to tell of terrifying confrontations with irate or disturbed constituents. We are buffers between MPs and the public, and Andrew Pennington tragically lost his life doing just what we do every day. </p> <p>Everyone agreed that it was not so much MPs who need protecting: after all, MPs are in Westminster most of the week, surrounded by policemen and all manner of security systems. We, on the other hand, spend some or all of the week in dingy constituency offices, sitting-ducks for anyone with a grievance, real or imagined, against our bosses. While most MPs return for the weekly surgery, for the rest of the week we cope with the casework and the callers, our phone numbers and location widely advertised. </p> <p>Most people think either that MPs pen every letter personally, or that our elected members have vast offices with teams of staff. The reality is neither. MPs receive an annual allowance of \u00a346,000 to cover everything, including staff salaries. At most, MPs will have two poorly paid staff, stretched to provide support for their member both in the House and in the constituency. </p> <p>The constituency office therefore is likely to be a shabby establishment, and there is seldom money to spare for security measures to be installed. To create the impression of accessibility, the office may well be a shop front, open all hours to anyone who wants to call. The vast majority who turn up to our weekly surgery are pleasant, ordinary local residents, and often you can use your MP's authority to resolve their problem by making representations to government departments or agencies. </p> <p>There is no training for this kind of work, no career progression or security of tenure, and there is no formal legal or parliamentary basis for it. Yet it carries huge responsibilities. You are regularly faced literally with life or death situations - the family facing deportation to almost certain persecution, the patient waiting for life-saving treatment, the battered wife on the doorstep with her children and with nowhere to run. And, yes, the mentally ill, the drug addict, the ex-offender, and the obsessive in various states of distress, often mouthing threats and obscenities. Drama is never in short supply. </p> <p>The trend to community care, and the closure of other advice services, have meant the path to the MP's door is well worn nowadays by deeply troubled and frustrated people. Similarly, the televising of parliament and saturation coverage of politics in the media has brought an explosion in the personal approaches to MPs in recent years. Whereas they used to be a last resort, MPs are increasingly the first port of call for those at odds with officialdom of any kind. </p> <p>MPs have become celebrities, but there are few celebrities whom you can see face to face each week, just down the road. The level of professional support that they need to meet rising expectations at a local level, in reasonably secure conditions, cannot be supported by existing funding. </p> <p>Some argue that MPs should not be glorified social workers, and that this is a distraction from their real job of making laws and running the country. Another view is that intimate contact with constituents keeps MPs in touch with the public, acts as a check on officialdom, and gives meaning to \"democracy for ordinary people\". </p> <p>I did not know Andrew Pennington but, from what I read, I am pretty sure he would have taken the latter view. Like all of us who work for MPs, he knew that you really could make a difference to people's lives by taking on the powerful on their behalf. </p> <p>It would be a fitting memorial to him if parliament were now to take a closer look at our work, to put it on a proper professional footing, and to give it the resources it deserves. </p> <p>\u0095 Sharon Grant has been PA to Bernie Grant MP since 1987</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Commons has got back to business after last month's murder of Andrew Pennington, assistant to MP Nigel Jones. Among themselves MPs' staff murmured. Though all were appalled, none was surprised. All of us had tales to tell of terrifying confrontations with irate or disturbed constituents. We are buffers between MPs and the public, and Andrew Pennington tragically lost his life doing just what we do every day. Everyone agreed that it was not so much MPs who need protecting: after all, MPs are in Westminster most of the week, surrounded by policemen and all manner of security systems. We, on the other hand, spend some or all of the week in dingy constituency offices, sitting-ducks for anyone with a grievance, real or imagined, against our bosses. While most MPs return for the weekly surgery, for the rest of the week we cope with the casework and the callers, our phone numbers and location widely advertised. Most people think either that MPs pen every letter personally, or that our elected members have vast offices with teams of staff. The reality is neither. MPs receive an annual allowance of \u00a346,000 to cover everything, including staff salaries. At most, MPs will have two poorly paid staff, stretched to provide support for their member both in the House and in the constituency. The constituency office therefore is likely to be a shabby establishment, and there is seldom money to spare for security measures to be installed. To create the impression of accessibility, the office may well be a shop front, open all hours to anyone who wants to call. The vast majority who turn up to our weekly surgery are pleasant, ordinary local residents, and often you can use your MP's authority to resolve their problem by making representations to government departments or agencies. There is no training for this kind of work, no career progression or security of tenure, and there is no formal legal or parliamentary basis for it. Yet it carries huge responsibilities. You are regularly faced literally with life or death situations - the family facing deportation to almost certain persecution, the patient waiting for life-saving treatment, the battered wife on the doorstep with her children and with nowhere to run. And, yes, the mentally ill, the drug addict, the ex-offender, and the obsessive in various states of distress, often mouthing threats and obscenities. Drama is never in short supply. The trend to community care, and the closure of other advice services, have meant the path to the MP's door is well worn nowadays by deeply troubled and frustrated people. Similarly, the televising of parliament and saturation coverage of politics in the media has brought an explosion in the personal approaches to MPs in recent years. Whereas they used to be a last resort, MPs are increasingly the first port of call for those at odds with officialdom of any kind. MPs have become celebrities, but there are few celebrities whom you can see face to face each week, just down the road. The level of professional support that they need to meet rising expectations at a local level, in reasonably secure conditions, cannot be supported by existing funding. Some argue that MPs should not be glorified social workers, and that this is a distraction from their real job of making laws and running the country. Another view is that intimate contact with constituents keeps MPs in touch with the public, acts as a check on officialdom, and gives meaning to \"democracy for ordinary people\". I did not know Andrew Pennington but, from what I read, I am pretty sure he would have taken the latter view. Like all of us who work for MPs, he knew that you really could make a difference to people's lives by taking on the powerful on their behalf. It would be a fitting memorial to him if parliament were now to take a closer look at our work, to put it on a proper professional footing, and to give it the resources it deserves. \u0095 Sharon Grant has been PA to Bernie Grant MP since 1987",
