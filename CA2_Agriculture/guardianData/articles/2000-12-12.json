      "bodyText": "The BBC's yearly TV and radio output will be subjected to external scrutiny for the first time. Under proposals revealed in today's white paper, the corporation will have to submit detailed accounts of how its services have performed to Ofcom, the new regulatory body. \"The BBC board of governors will naturally want to consider observations by Ofcom in drawing up the BBC's annual statement,\" says the white paper. ITV and Channel 4 are already subjected to detailed and sometimes painful scrutiny of their output by the Independent Television Commission as part of the well-established annual performance review. But this will be the first time that the BBC has got to liaise officially with an outside regulatory body. Today BBC chairman Sir Christopher Bland admitted: \"We will have to be increasingly explicit and more precise about our objectives for our services\". By and large the white paper leaves the BBC board of governors intact, noting that the corporation has already moved some way by providing detailed annual reports and statement of promises Sir Christopher said that the corporation would have to become more accountable to the public but declared himself \"very content\" with the \"sensible proposals\" for the BBC. He highlighted the fact that BBC governors will maintain existing responsibilities \"for content on all BBC services and retain sole responsibility for delivering the BBC's public service remit\". \"We don't think that responsibility can be shared or second-guessed and the white paper agreed.\" The BBC also said it had volunteered to introduce tight new rules which would guarantee news and current affairs in primetime. Sir Christopher said that contrary to reports the rules were not being imposed on the BBC in protest against its decision to switch the Nine O'Clock News to 10pm. \"We felt it was an anomaly. It won't change our behaviour in any way, but it codifies it,\" he said. Sir Christopher also welcomed the proposal which gives Ofcom an \"ombudsman\" role over complaints about the BBC from viewers and listeners. \"We agree that merging the old BSC role into Ofcom as an appeal forum will bring greater clarity for viewers and listeners. It also emerged today that Ofcom will police the BBC's obligations in subtitling and regional output.",

      "bodyText": "ITN shareholders have criticised the Culture Secretary, claiming that the communications white paper hasn't gone far enough in relaxing the rules for ownership of the news organisation. Carlton and Granada are angry that the communications white paper, published this afternoon, says that the government will \"consider\" relaxing the 20% limit on ownership of the news provider. They had hoped that the new legislation would pave the way for a Granada/Carlton carve up. The white paper removes most of the TV industry restrictions which prevent the consolidation of ITV; dropping the rule that prevents a single TV company owning more than 15% of TV audience share and allowing a single company to control both London weekday and weekend franchises. But Carlton and Granada are unhappy that the restrictive 20% barrier to ITN ownership is still in place. Plans for an ITN float, already delayed, have been \"kicked into the long grass\", according to one source. \"It is known that ITN shareholders are angry with the lack of commitment in the white paper,\" said another. The source said the real reason Mr Smith ignored pleas by the ITN shareholders for a free-for-all was his continuing scepticism about ITV's commitment to serious news and current affairs. A Carlton spokesman said: \"We think this limit should be removed and we always have done.\" He added that an ITN flotation \"was always only an option, and it remains an option\". A Granada spokesman said: \"It's fine for us for now. It would be more worrying if the reference to it wasn't in there at all.\" ITN today gave a warm welcome to the communications white paper. It said it was delighted that its position at the heart of broadcasting was being safeguarded. Stewart Purvis, ITN chief executive, said: \"This white paper was certainly worth the wait.

First, most of this paper mountain consists of routine forms and invoices needed to order supplies, equipment and staff. </p> <p>Second, it costs a lot of money. For every pound the NHS spends on pills, bandages and bedpans, 25p goes into the paperwork.</p> <p>\"Research shows that supply chain costs make up 25% of invoice value,\" says Sean Flanagan, chief executive of Medex Online, a new \"e-health\" company. He says that electronic messages could cut this cost in half.</p> <p>Although the dot.com crash has taken most of the shine off electronic commerce in the consumer market, there is no doubt that, when large organisations do their shopping, e-commerce makes sense: car-makers and supermarkets have been ordering, invoicing and paying for their supplies electronically for years.</p> <p>Healthcare, too, is getting into e-commerce - in the US at least.

      "bodyText": "At any given moment, one billion paper messages are circulating around the NHS. If that number - an estimate by the NHS Executive - looks suspiciously round it is because no one has ever counted. We do, however, know two things for certain. First, most of this paper mountain consists of routine forms and invoices needed to order supplies, equipment and staff. Second, it costs a lot of money. For every pound the NHS spends on pills, bandages and bedpans, 25p goes into the paperwork. \"Research shows that supply chain costs make up 25% of invoice value,\" says Sean Flanagan, chief executive of Medex Online, a new \"e-health\" company. He says that electronic messages could cut this cost in half. Although the dot.com crash has taken most of the shine off electronic commerce in the consumer market, there is no doubt that, when large organisations do their shopping, e-commerce makes sense: car-makers and supermarkets have been ordering, invoicing and paying for their supplies electronically for years. Healthcare, too, is getting into e-commerce - in the US at least. Research in the US shows that a 10% cut from supply chain costs adds 1% to an organisation's profits. As most American hospitals operate on profit margins of only 2% or 3%, the US healthcare industry is taking it seriously. Now it's the NHS's turn. The NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency, set up in April this year to help the NHS do its shopping more efficiently, is about to publish an e-commerce strategy for the health service. The agency is also developing an e-commerce system, SupplyStream, that will allow trusts and other NHS organisations to order supplies electronically from private firms. The scheme is part of a government-wide race to get into the e-commerce age. The Department of Health has already published an internal e-business strategy laying out its plans to hook its internal systems up to the NHS's network, NHSnet, as well as the wider internet. Like other government departments, it is trying to meet the prime minister's deadline for all public services to be delivered electronically by 2005. Under this timetable, 90% of routine government purchases are to be made electronically by next April. Barring a miracle (or, more likely, some creative statistical juggling) this target will be missed. Although the Office of Government Commerce, set up by the Treasury in April this year, says the government could save \u00a31bn from its shopping bill by catching up with the rest of the world, e-business in the public sector is happening only in patches. One example is a scheme to issue civil servants with government Visa cards, to cut the \u00a3300m the government spends a year on low-value, high-volume goods. So far, however, only 14% of such purchases are handled by the government procurement card, according to its annual report published last week. Predictably, the biggest use of the government procurement card was in buying stationery. Last year, civil servants used their flexible friends 37,756 times to buy paper clips, pads and other stationery worth \u00a32.7m from supplier Guilbert. Yet there is still hope.

      "body": "<p>The story came to Private Eye by a familiar route: two freelance journalists who had written it for the Daily Express, but couldn't get it published. It featured Gurpal Singh Virdi, a Sikh sergeant at Ealing police station, west London. I spoke to Sgt Virdi who seemed genuinely aggrieved.</p> <p>He told me how he had dealt with a racist attack in his area in March 1998. Five thugs had attacked an Iraqi student. Sgt Virdi found the student bleeding in the street, called an ambulance, and joined in the hunt for the assailants. Three were found by his colleagues. He arrested the other two in a back street. All five were eventually convicted.</p> <p>Mr Virdi complained to his superiors that the attack had not initially been classified as racist (as it eventually was). Not much later the sergeant and his family went on holiday. On their return, their home was raided and searched by anti-terrorist officers. Mr Virdi was suspended on suspicion of sending racist mail to himself and fellow officers. He was told that the mail, which included the message that black officers were \"not wanted\", had been sent from his personal computer. Private Eye ran the story - the first of 12 on the subject in two years.</p> <p>In March last year, Mr Virdi faced a police disciplinary tribunal. Three commanders sat in judgment - Richard Cullen, then head of the police training school, Graham James, later at the directorate of professional standards, and Alan Shave from south-west London.

      "bodyText": "The story came to Private Eye by a familiar route: two freelance journalists who had written it for the Daily Express, but couldn't get it published. It featured Gurpal Singh Virdi, a Sikh sergeant at Ealing police station, west London. I spoke to Sgt Virdi who seemed genuinely aggrieved. He told me how he had dealt with a racist attack in his area in March 1998. Five thugs had attacked an Iraqi student. Sgt Virdi found the student bleeding in the street, called an ambulance, and joined in the hunt for the assailants. Three were found by his colleagues. He arrested the other two in a back street. All five were eventually convicted. Mr Virdi complained to his superiors that the attack had not initially been classified as racist (as it eventually was). Not much later the sergeant and his family went on holiday. On their return, their home was raided and searched by anti-terrorist officers. Mr Virdi was suspended on suspicion of sending racist mail to himself and fellow officers. He was told that the mail, which included the message that black officers were \"not wanted\", had been sent from his personal computer. Private Eye ran the story - the first of 12 on the subject in two years. In March last year, Mr Virdi faced a police disciplinary tribunal. Three commanders sat in judgment - Richard Cullen, then head of the police training school, Graham James, later at the directorate of professional standards, and Alan Shave from south-west London. After a four-week hearing, the commanders declared that Mr Virdi was guilty as charged. The details of the police case were then made available to the press. The story fitted perfectly with the common prejudice that black police are as likely to be racist as white police.

Endeavour's flight ended Monday evening the same way it began: right on time. </p> <p>The shuttle touched down on the illuminated runway just four minutes after the space station, Alpha, soared overhead with its gleaming, new solar wings. The station was clearly visible as it streaked through the dark sky. </p> <p>By the time the shuttle landed, the station was just off the Virginia coast, its three residents supposedly asleep. </p> <p>\"Outstanding job. Welcome back,\" Mission Control told Endeavour commander Brent Jett Jr. once he guided the shuttle to a safe stop. </p> <p>During their week at the space station, Jett and his crew installed the world's largest and most powerful solar wings. Three spacewalks were required to attach the $600 million wings, hook up all the cables and then tighten the slack right wing. </p> <p>The astronauts also spent one day inside Alpha, helping commander Bill Shepherd and his two Russian crewmates with computer problems and cargo transfers. </p> <p>\"If you've been following the mission, you know it's been a pretty exciting 11 days for us,\" Jett said after climbing out of Endeavour. </p> <p>It was Nasa's third space station mission in as many months, but the most critical by far \"because we knew we had to get those solar arrays installed and deployed,\" Dittemore said. </p> <p>Thanks to the new electricity-producing solar wings, which stretch 240 feet from tip to tip, Shepherd and cosmonauts Yuri Gidzenko and Sergei Krikalev no longer have to conserve power aboard the space station. They also now have access to the entire three-room complex; one room had been sealed off because there was not enough power to heat it. </p> <p>Altogether, the solar wings cover half an acre and make Alpha one of the brightest 'stars' in the night sky. Nasa Administrator Daniel Goldin was thrilled to see Alpha fly overhead. </p> <p>\"Fantastic! No binoculars, no telescopes,\" Goldin said. \"It's a symbol of what great accomplishments we've made.\" </p> <p>Shepherd and his crew have been aboard the space station for one month and have three more months to go before they return to Earth. Their ride home aboard space shuttle Discovery likely will be delayed a week or two because of damaged thrusters that need to be replaced, Dittemore said. </p> <p>The next space station visitors will be five astronauts who are supposed to deliver the American-made lab Destiny aboard space shuttle Atlantis in January. </p> <p>Nasa held off moving Atlantis to the launch pad Monday to inspect electrical connectors for explosive devices used to separate the two solid-fuel boosters from the shuttle during liftoff. One of those devices failed to work during Endeavour's climb to orbit on November 30; a backup charge severed the left booster as planned.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Space shuttle Endeavour's five astronauts returned from the international space station and, within minutes, were receiving accolades for pulling off Nasa's most complicated and critical construction mission yet. \"In anybody's ballpark, this mission was really a home run,\" said shuttle program manager Ron Dittemore. Endeavour's flight ended Monday evening the same way it began: right on time. The shuttle touched down on the illuminated runway just four minutes after the space station, Alpha, soared overhead with its gleaming, new solar wings. The station was clearly visible as it streaked through the dark sky. By the time the shuttle landed, the station was just off the Virginia coast, its three residents supposedly asleep. \"Outstanding job. Welcome back,\" Mission Control told Endeavour commander Brent Jett Jr. once he guided the shuttle to a safe stop. During their week at the space station, Jett and his crew installed the world's largest and most powerful solar wings. Three spacewalks were required to attach the $600 million wings, hook up all the cables and then tighten the slack right wing. The astronauts also spent one day inside Alpha, helping commander Bill Shepherd and his two Russian crewmates with computer problems and cargo transfers. \"If you've been following the mission, you know it's been a pretty exciting 11 days for us,\" Jett said after climbing out of Endeavour. It was Nasa's third space station mission in as many months, but the most critical by far \"because we knew we had to get those solar arrays installed and deployed,\" Dittemore said. Thanks to the new electricity-producing solar wings, which stretch 240 feet from tip to tip, Shepherd and cosmonauts Yuri Gidzenko and Sergei Krikalev no longer have to conserve power aboard the space station. They also now have access to the entire three-room complex; one room had been sealed off because there was not enough power to heat it. Altogether, the solar wings cover half an acre and make Alpha one of the brightest 'stars' in the night sky. Nasa Administrator Daniel Goldin was thrilled to see Alpha fly overhead. \"Fantastic! No binoculars, no telescopes,\" Goldin said. \"It's a symbol of what great accomplishments we've made.\" Shepherd and his crew have been aboard the space station for one month and have three more months to go before they return to Earth. Their ride home aboard space shuttle Discovery likely will be delayed a week or two because of damaged thrusters that need to be replaced, Dittemore said. The next space station visitors will be five astronauts who are supposed to deliver the American-made lab Destiny aboard space shuttle Atlantis in January. Nasa held off moving Atlantis to the launch pad Monday to inspect electrical connectors for explosive devices used to separate the two solid-fuel boosters from the shuttle during liftoff. One of those devices failed to work during Endeavour's climb to orbit on November 30; a backup charge severed the left booster as planned.",

      "byline": "Matthew Norman",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Tuesday: </p> <p> During breakfast, I am surprised to be addressed directly by my wife. \"Look at this,\" she says, pointing to a page in the Telegraph. \"That mobile I bought you for your birthday last year, it's top of this league table. Isn't that good?\" Yes, I say, but what precisely has it won? She doesn't reply, and only when she moves on to the Mail do I get the chance to check. The Ericsson T28 is top of the mobiles, I read, for radiation emitted. </p> <p> Wednesday: </p> <p> Today a gradual change - a strange sense of disorientation and remoteness - is more noticeable, while the short-term memory is appalling. I have ascribed this to the aggregated effects of drink and age, but I'm not so sure. When a professor from Charing Cross hospital, a charming man whom we met once in the summer, rings to ask us to a party, I try to pick his brains. But he says it isn't his field. </p> <p> Thursday: </p> <p> Thumpy eyes, taut scalp, sensitised sinews, stiff neck . . . I am struck by the familiar symptoms of some nameless viruses, and midway through walking the dog I am too fatigued to continue. I call the Grove clinic on the mobile. Although things are running smoothly there, and I am kept waiting barely 10 minutes, by the time the receptionist asks me what the problem is, I have forgotten why I rang in the first place. </p> <p> Friday: </p> <p> The virus worsens, and I lie beneath a blanket on the sofa, doing what Rebecca calls my \"Elizabeth Barrett Browning wan consumptive number\". Yet for all the sharpness of her tongue, my wife is astoundingly attentive. She calls 11 times from her office for a bulletin - each time, perplexingly, on my mobile. When it rings for a 12th time shortly after noon, it is my physician, Sarah Jarvis. \"Ah, doctor, thanks for calling back,\" I say, but she replies that I never called in the first place. The doctor chats away for ages before muttering something about wanting to contact someone called Penny but ringing the wrong number - and when I ask if she knows where I might come by a second-hand geiger counter, she hurriedly takes her leave. </p> <p> Saturday: </p> <p> A friend who keeps me in touch with cybermedicine emails recom mending an \"ask the doctor\" feature at AmericasDoctor.com. Although baffled by the home page, I manage to register to be kept up to date with major cancer and cardiac developments. Or so I think. Two hours later, a confirmatory email arrives, thanking me for volunteering and asking me to \"ensure you arrive at the University of Wisconsin medical centre promptly by 9.30am on January 27, when the female stress incontinence clinical trial will begin.\" </p> <p> Sunday: </p> <p> Awake feeling dazed and distressed having passed a troubled night. In the dream, my Ericsson T28 goes missing and Rebecca promises to replace it. \"Let's go and get the new one now, for your Christmas present,\" she says. The next I know, we are landing on the Sellafield helipad, where a white-coated Dr Jarvis greets us. \"Hurry,\" she yells over the whirring of blades, \"they've only got one Depleted Uranium phone, with WAP and text messaging, left in the shop.\" Hurriedly, Rebecca pays for the phone. When, within moments of calling the speaking clock, I notice a third eye in the middle of my forehead, I awake. </p> <p> Monday: </p> <p> Another troubled night, then a fretful day. Something is plaguing me, and has been for some time, but not until night do I work out what. \"Of course, it's that nice professor,\" I yelp over the Indian takeaway. Rebecca eyes a forkful of Bombay aloo quizzically and asks me to expand. \"The professor who asked us to his party . . . don't you think it's odd?\" \"Why?\" \"No one ever asks us to a party. Obviously someone's asked him to lure me over so he can examine me. It's a brain tumour, isn't it?\" Rebecca snaps a poppadom in two.\"Remind me,\" she says, \"what exactly he's a professor of?\" \"I told you before,\" I snap back, \"gynaecology.\" Finishing her chicken korma, she replaces her cutlery and leaves the room.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Tuesday: During breakfast, I am surprised to be addressed directly by my wife. \"Look at this,\" she says, pointing to a page in the Telegraph. \"That mobile I bought you for your birthday last year, it's top of this league table. Isn't that good?\" Yes, I say, but what precisely has it won? She doesn't reply, and only when she moves on to the Mail do I get the chance to check. The Ericsson T28 is top of the mobiles, I read, for radiation emitted. Wednesday: Today a gradual change - a strange sense of disorientation and remoteness - is more noticeable, while the short-term memory is appalling. I have ascribed this to the aggregated effects of drink and age, but I'm not so sure. When a professor from Charing Cross hospital, a charming man whom we met once in the summer, rings to ask us to a party, I try to pick his brains. But he says it isn't his field. Thursday: Thumpy eyes, taut scalp, sensitised sinews, stiff neck . . . I am struck by the familiar symptoms of some nameless viruses, and midway through walking the dog I am too fatigued to continue. I call the Grove clinic on the mobile. Although things are running smoothly there, and I am kept waiting barely 10 minutes, by the time the receptionist asks me what the problem is, I have forgotten why I rang in the first place. Friday: The virus worsens, and I lie beneath a blanket on the sofa, doing what Rebecca calls my \"Elizabeth Barrett Browning wan consumptive number\". Yet for all the sharpness of her tongue, my wife is astoundingly attentive. She calls 11 times from her office for a bulletin - each time, perplexingly, on my mobile. When it rings for a 12th time shortly after noon, it is my physician, Sarah Jarvis. \"Ah, doctor, thanks for calling back,\" I say, but she replies that I never called in the first place. The doctor chats away for ages before muttering something about wanting to contact someone called Penny but ringing the wrong number - and when I ask if she knows where I might come by a second-hand geiger counter, she hurriedly takes her leave. Saturday: A friend who keeps me in touch with cybermedicine emails recom mending an \"ask the doctor\" feature at AmericasDoctor.com. Although baffled by the home page, I manage to register to be kept up to date with major cancer and cardiac developments. Or so I think. Two hours later, a confirmatory email arrives, thanking me for volunteering and asking me to \"ensure you arrive at the University of Wisconsin medical centre promptly by 9.30am on January 27, when the female stress incontinence clinical trial will begin.\" Sunday: Awake feeling dazed and distressed having passed a troubled night. In the dream, my Ericsson T28 goes missing and Rebecca promises to replace it. \"Let's go and get the new one now, for your Christmas present,\" she says. The next I know, we are landing on the Sellafield helipad, where a white-coated Dr Jarvis greets us. \"Hurry,\" she yells over the whirring of blades, \"they've only got one Depleted Uranium phone, with WAP and text messaging, left in the shop.\" Hurriedly, Rebecca pays for the phone. When, within moments of calling the speaking clock, I notice a third eye in the middle of my forehead, I awake. Monday: Another troubled night, then a fretful day. Something is plaguing me, and has been for some time, but not until night do I work out what. \"Of course, it's that nice professor,\" I yelp over the Indian takeaway. Rebecca eyes a forkful of Bombay aloo quizzically and asks me to expand. \"The professor who asked us to his party . . . don't you think it's odd?\" \"Why?\" \"No one ever asks us to a party. Obviously someone's asked him to lure me over so he can examine me. It's a brain tumour, isn't it?\" Rebecca snaps a poppadom in two.\"Remind me,\" she says, \"what exactly he's a professor of?\" \"I told you before,\" I snap back, \"gynaecology.\" Finishing her chicken korma, she replaces her cutlery and leaves the room.",

      "body": "<p>Remember the child in your class no one ever wanted for their partner? Or that furtive-looking microbiologist in your hall of residence, who never spoke but ended up getting a first? Or your train-spotting ex-boss? You probably dismissed them, more or less sympathetically, as nerds and geeks. But what if the reason they struggled on the social fringes but succeeded academically was because they had the form of autism known as Asperger syndrome? </p> <p>Asperger syndrome was unheard of 20 years ago. Now it seems to be everywhere. Ludwig Wittgenstein, the philosopher, who designed and made a sewing machine at the age of 10 and was friendless and teased by his fellow students, is thought to have had Asperger. So too is long-haired, green-slippered Albert Einstein, who used to lose his train of thought in the middle of giving a lecture. </p> <p>Their modern day equivalent, Bill Gates, the Microsoft chief executive and Windows inventor, has been described as having autistic-type traits: lack of eye contact, poor social skills, a monotonous voice, a prodigious memory and a tendency to rock backwards and forwards during business meetings. </p> <p>Twenty years ago we thought we knew what autistic people were like. They had low IQs and limited language, they behaved bizarrely, and they were put into special schools and residential homes. Autism occurred in about one in 10,000 of the population. Since then, it has been redefined as a spectrum ranging from mild to severe - and with that redefinition has come a massive increase in numbers. Some researchers say one schoolchild in every 70 is now diagnosed with a form of autism, including children with average or higher intelligence and no difficulty learning to speak. These are the ones categorised as having Asperger. </p> <p>Much of this extraordinary increase is due to teachers and psychologists looking again at children who might have been written off as loners or anti-social, and recognising the typical autistic pattern of social reticence, poor imagination, inability to see into others' minds, emotional blankness, unusual obsessions. But unless something nasty has got into the water, the implication of finding all these extra autistic children is that there have always been large numbers of otherwise ordinary people with this cluster of symptoms, which means that an awful lot of us are walking around with AS and no idea that we have it. </p> <p>Dr Simon Baron-Cohen, a Cambridge psychologist and autism expert, sees adults making this discovery all the time in his recently established clinic, the first in the country to specialise in late diagnosis of the syndrome. Their GPs have referred them because they fit a set of criteria suggesting that they have had unrecognised AS all their lives. </p> <p>Some of them are terribly sad, says Baron-Cohen: \"We are seeing people in their 20s, 30s and 40s. Many have awful stories to tell about being bullied at school, losing jobs, broken relationships. You see men who have meals and sex with their wives, but they don't have an emotional relationship. Their partners will start saying something that is a clear signal for emotional support, like \"I got the results of my tests back from the doctor today\" and they will say \"Not now, I'm watching the football.\" </p> <p>Since the clinic was established, Baron-Cohen has seen more than 50 adults and has a waiting list of another 20. To confirm Asperger, which is always detectable in early childhood, whereas schizophrenia or obsessive-compulsive disorder would appear in the teenage years, patients must, if possible, bring along a parent: \"It can be a bit embarrassing, asking an 80-year-old mother if her 40-year-old son used to mix with the other children when he went to playgroup. But quite often you get a really clear picture. They say, 'My child has always been a loner; at school the only people my child talked to were the teachers'. That's a classic.\" </p> <p>The majority of clinic attenders are men. (Nine out of ten autistics are male). Half are married or in steady relationships. Their jobs (most are in work) are largely in computing, scientific research, mathematics and engineering. They all have obsessions: \"One 35-year-old woman had 2,000 videos and knew the directors of all of them,\" says Baron-Cohen. \"You begin to get a picture of what these people's bedrooms are like.\" </p> <p>But one man's obsession is another's life work. Many people with Asperger are high-achievers: one man reads dictionaries and speaks 10 languages; others are at the cutting edge of technology. Not all gain promotion to the level of their qualifications: one draughtsman had won a string of awards for his work, but remained low on the pay scale because he would not allow anyone who worked for him to stop for coffee or conversation. </p> <p>Some work environments enable people with the syndrome to flourish. Richard Borcherds, professor of maths at Berkeley in California, was 38 and teaching at Cambridge when he won the Fields medal - the equivalent of the maths Nobel prize. He suspected he might have autism after reading an article about it when he was in his 30s and recognised many of its symptoms in himself. Borcherds, who describes himself as \"socially inept\", knew Baron-Cohen, who assessed him for a study of Asperger high-flyers and diagnosed that he did indeed have AS. Yet his career has certainly not suffered: \"I've spent most of my life in universities, where eccentricity is fairly common, which probably made me stand out less. Most maths departments I've been in have at least one person who is clearly weirder than I am.\" </p> <p>There are theories that whatever makes the Asperger brain function differently - and the current theory is that the right and left halves of the AS brain have insufficient \"central coherence\" or pulling-together power to see the overall picture - may also be of benefit in work which requires very precise attention to detail. </p> <p>People may need to think like this, to a greater or lesser extent, to be the best computer analysts. That does not necessarily mean that all computer analysts have Asperger. But there are weird results from surveys of students and professionals in science and engineering showing that very large numbers - \"sometimes more than one in four\" - have a close relative with autism. Since autism has a powerful genetic factor, the implication is that the labs are full of people who fit somewhere on the autistic spectrum too. </p> <p>But if they can live and work with Asperger, why go to the trouble of labelling them? Borcherds believes that for him, diagnosis was fairly pointless: \"It might have been useful 20 or 30 years ago; maybe I could have had explicit lessons in social behaviour or something like that. But by now it seems to make little difference.\" </p> <p>That is not what the people attending the Cambridge clinic feel, since they or their families - several patients have been sent along by their desperate wives - are by definition seeking some kind of help. Nor is it the view of Clare Sainsbury, daughter of Lord Sainsbury, the Labour peer and science minister, who was 20 and an Oxford philosophy student when she read about Asperger and recognised herself. </p> <p>She grew up, she says, bullied, depressed, convinced that she was either schizophrenic or an abandoned alien from another planet. She trained herself to perform social smiles in front of a mirror, and got away with parroting back greetings like \"hello\" and \"goodbye\" until the awful day when somebody wished her happy birthday. </p> <p>\"Being diagnosed was a huge relief. Finally to have a name for it, to be able to say, 'this is how Clare is and it's not that she's not trying hard enough or being deliberately difficult'. I have been able to stop tortur ing myself, and it has been wonderful for my family because parents often get blamed for their children's behaviour and it must have been very hard for them to defend the way I behaved, even if it didn't conform to other people's ideas of normal.\" </p> <p>Viewed from the majority perspective, people who fail to make eye contact are shifty or sinister. Asperger adults are constantly tailed by shop security guards, even though their inflexible mental processes make it unthinkable that they would break the law. Viewed from the perspective of an AS researcher at Yale University, the picture is rather different: \"If we are autists, you guys are heterists. The diagnostic features of heterists are making lots of eye contact and overlooking details such as small coins on patterned carpets or car number plates.\" </p> <p>Maybe what we need is to value as well as label the differences between the ways our different brains work. Or as Temple Grandin, an American autistic woman whose obsession with cattle pens led her to become the world's expert on humane corralling of cattle cattle, puts it: \"What would happen if you eliminated the autism gene from the gene pool? You would have a bunch of people standing around in a cave, chatting and socialising and not getting anything done.\" </p> <p>\u0095 From the Cambridge Lifespan Asperger Syndrome Service, email <a href=\"mailto:sb205@cus.cam.ac.uk\">sb205@cus.cam.ac.uk</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>What surprised me most about my experience in the John Radcliffe hospital was the anger it inspired in other doctors. \"You have to sue,\" one trauma doctor friend said. \"You must write to your member of parliament,\" a local GP insisted. \"You must write to the press.\" He even thought we needed to adopt something of America's litigious culture to improve the situation. \"It's third world!\" he said. \"Nothing will change unless patients are prepared to complain.\" </p> <p>I hadn't expected this from the professionals. For me, as for many people, the virtue of the NHS was an article of faith. I still had an image of valiant doctors and angelic nurses fighting together an ordered campaign against the odds. I cling to this image still. But a week in the orthopaedic/trauma ward of the John Radcliffe makes you painfully aware of the human reality of chronic underfunding. You feel that you are lying somewhere near the bottom of a downward path, where the lines of command and control are breaking down. In your worst moments, it seems that all that survives is the sweet talk of care. </p> <p>I flew into chaos the moment I arrived by helicopter having fallen from an eight foot ladder on an island in the Thames. Although the paramedics had efficiently radioed ahead to tell the hospital that the helicopter was for logistical reasons rather than resuscitatory, the message had not got through to the trauma team, which had been dragged from other operations to greet me. They vanished in understandable irritation when they saw that I was conscious, instructing the radiographer to x-ray my back. </p> <p>I saw my spine emerge on a light box attached to the far wall. As I lay there trying to decipher its ominous message, the kindly radiographer kept leaving her job to ask me whether a doctor had seen it yet. Eventually, she pulled the x-rays off the wall and strode out of the room to find someone herself. </p> <p>The doctor she brought told me that I had fractured a vertebra but I would probably be discharged and advised to take bed rest. In the end, I lay in hospital for six days, waiting for a full torso brace to be fitted and then another five in the Nuffield orthopaedic centre where I had a new brace fitted because the first did not fit. Apparently, the John Radcliffe reverted to making back braces out of unwieldy fibreglass instead of thermo-plastic after the machine for heating the plastic broke and was replaced by one that was too small. </p> <p>Like others in my ward, I lay for the first 23 hours on a trolley in a corridor in casualty, watching stretchers rolling in. Without a bell and without my friend, who had gone home expecting me to be discharged, I spent an increasingly frantic night trying to get more pain-relief. People were passing but my voice was too small to attract their attention. In their state of overwork, they seemed to adopt a kind of closed look, trying, like waiters in a busy bar, not to catch your eye. I managed to get five people to stop in the space of several hours. After the fifth had said, with swift sympathy like the rest, that he would see what he could do and disappeared, I was desperate. An innocent junior doctor got my explosion: \"I've been in pain for hours. I've been told I can have morphine and I can't get anyone to give it to me.\" </p> <p>I got my morphine and while I had the nurse's attention, I asked about my hand which was hurting even more than my back. I thought the intravenous line in the back of my hand was causing the pain. The nurse wasn't convinced. She said I had probably hurt it during my fall and showed me the bruises up my arm. But she already had another patient to attend to. I felt I'd had my ration of care. Six weeks later, when the pain was still there, my GP sent me for an x-ray. I had, in fact, broken my hand. Now, three months later, the plaster has been removed and my hand hasn't healed. I will probably have to have an operation. </p> <p>It is not surprising that such mistakes are made. One nurse I spoke to told me that the John Radcliffe has only a third of staff required. I thought I'd misunderstood her and that she meant that they were understaffed by a third. \"No,\" she said. \"We are down by 60%.\" </p> <p>The strongest impression I got from my week in the JR was of the destructiveness of chronic underfunding. You felt you were way down a line in which doctors and nurses had been coping with too many people for too long. From the moment of admission you acquired a new persona - you were \"a patient\": your needs were familiar but impossible to meet adequately, you would therefore be demanding and need placating. What was interesting was how quickly we adopted the role: how quickly the bond between patient and nurse deteriorated into a sense of \"them and us\". Each time a nurse entered the ward we all sought her attention, not knowing when we were next going to get help. </p> <p>Indeed, we very quickly sussed the prisoners' dilemma. Everyone rang their bell for me when I was about to vomit, lying flat on my back unable to move and in danger of choking. We all rang our bells when one of us was left painfully stranded on the com mode. After a particularly bad night, during which the 94-year-old woman in the bed next to me had been crying in pain on the bedpan for ages and was then chastised for not having used it, I said to one nurse who had a sense of humour: \"Sometimes this feels like a prison.\" </p> <p>I kept thinking of something Brian Keenan wrote about his experience as a hostage in Lebanon. According to him, the physical torture was never as bad as the torture of uncertainty. I had found that difficult to believe. But in my ward, the times that people broke down were not when we were in agony but when we were rendered powerless in the face of apparent chance. The woman in the bed next to me was starved all day for an operation and then told, after dinner had passed, that it had been cancelled. She was halfway through breakfast next day when, without warning, the trolley arrived to take her to theatre. They had forgotten to put \"Nil by mouth\" on the end of her bed. On many occasions, my cup of tea was left beyond my reach. No one had time to help me eat or to work out what I could eat by myself. Eventually, my family brought in food which they fed me and stored in the hospital fridge. </p> <p>On the fifth day, somebody noticed that I hadn't been given aspirin since my accident despite a danger of blood-clotting. I still had not got my brace. The nurses' reassurances began to seem frighteningly disconnected from reality. Two days running I had been told I would be taken to the plaster room.

      "bodyText": "What surprised me most about my experience in the John Radcliffe hospital was the anger it inspired in other doctors. \"You have to sue,\" one trauma doctor friend said. \"You must write to your member of parliament,\" a local GP insisted. \"You must write to the press.\" He even thought we needed to adopt something of America's litigious culture to improve the situation. \"It's third world!\" he said. \"Nothing will change unless patients are prepared to complain.\" I hadn't expected this from the professionals. For me, as for many people, the virtue of the NHS was an article of faith. I still had an image of valiant doctors and angelic nurses fighting together an ordered campaign against the odds. I cling to this image still. But a week in the orthopaedic/trauma ward of the John Radcliffe makes you painfully aware of the human reality of chronic underfunding. You feel that you are lying somewhere near the bottom of a downward path, where the lines of command and control are breaking down. In your worst moments, it seems that all that survives is the sweet talk of care. I flew into chaos the moment I arrived by helicopter having fallen from an eight foot ladder on an island in the Thames. Although the paramedics had efficiently radioed ahead to tell the hospital that the helicopter was for logistical reasons rather than resuscitatory, the message had not got through to the trauma team, which had been dragged from other operations to greet me. They vanished in understandable irritation when they saw that I was conscious, instructing the radiographer to x-ray my back. I saw my spine emerge on a light box attached to the far wall. As I lay there trying to decipher its ominous message, the kindly radiographer kept leaving her job to ask me whether a doctor had seen it yet. Eventually, she pulled the x-rays off the wall and strode out of the room to find someone herself. The doctor she brought told me that I had fractured a vertebra but I would probably be discharged and advised to take bed rest. In the end, I lay in hospital for six days, waiting for a full torso brace to be fitted and then another five in the Nuffield orthopaedic centre where I had a new brace fitted because the first did not fit. Apparently, the John Radcliffe reverted to making back braces out of unwieldy fibreglass instead of thermo-plastic after the machine for heating the plastic broke and was replaced by one that was too small. Like others in my ward, I lay for the first 23 hours on a trolley in a corridor in casualty, watching stretchers rolling in. Without a bell and without my friend, who had gone home expecting me to be discharged, I spent an increasingly frantic night trying to get more pain-relief. People were passing but my voice was too small to attract their attention. In their state of overwork, they seemed to adopt a kind of closed look, trying, like waiters in a busy bar, not to catch your eye. I managed to get five people to stop in the space of several hours. After the fifth had said, with swift sympathy like the rest, that he would see what he could do and disappeared, I was desperate. An innocent junior doctor got my explosion: \"I've been in pain for hours. I've been told I can have morphine and I can't get anyone to give it to me.\" I got my morphine and while I had the nurse's attention, I asked about my hand which was hurting even more than my back. I thought the intravenous line in the back of my hand was causing the pain. The nurse wasn't convinced. She said I had probably hurt it during my fall and showed me the bruises up my arm. But she already had another patient to attend to. I felt I'd had my ration of care. Six weeks later, when the pain was still there, my GP sent me for an x-ray. I had, in fact, broken my hand. Now, three months later, the plaster has been removed and my hand hasn't healed. I will probably have to have an operation. It is not surprising that such mistakes are made. One nurse I spoke to told me that the John Radcliffe has only a third of staff required. I thought I'd misunderstood her and that she meant that they were understaffed by a third. \"No,\" she said. \"We are down by 60%.\" The strongest impression I got from my week in the JR was of the destructiveness of chronic underfunding. You felt you were way down a line in which doctors and nurses had been coping with too many people for too long. From the moment of admission you acquired a new persona - you were \"a patient\": your needs were familiar but impossible to meet adequately, you would therefore be demanding and need placating. What was interesting was how quickly we adopted the role: how quickly the bond between patient and nurse deteriorated into a sense of \"them and us\". Each time a nurse entered the ward we all sought her attention, not knowing when we were next going to get help. Indeed, we very quickly sussed the prisoners' dilemma. Everyone rang their bell for me when I was about to vomit, lying flat on my back unable to move and in danger of choking. We all rang our bells when one of us was left painfully stranded on the com mode. After a particularly bad night, during which the 94-year-old woman in the bed next to me had been crying in pain on the bedpan for ages and was then chastised for not having used it, I said to one nurse who had a sense of humour: \"Sometimes this feels like a prison.\" I kept thinking of something Brian Keenan wrote about his experience as a hostage in Lebanon. According to him, the physical torture was never as bad as the torture of uncertainty. I had found that difficult to believe. But in my ward, the times that people broke down were not when we were in agony but when we were rendered powerless in the face of apparent chance. The woman in the bed next to me was starved all day for an operation and then told, after dinner had passed, that it had been cancelled. She was halfway through breakfast next day when, without warning, the trolley arrived to take her to theatre. They had forgotten to put \"Nil by mouth\" on the end of her bed. On many occasions, my cup of tea was left beyond my reach. No one had time to help me eat or to work out what I could eat by myself. Eventually, my family brought in food which they fed me and stored in the hospital fridge. On the fifth day, somebody noticed that I hadn't been given aspirin since my accident despite a danger of blood-clotting. I still had not got my brace. The nurses' reassurances began to seem frighteningly disconnected from reality. Two days running I had been told I would be taken to the plaster room. At lunch-time the nurse would go to find out what was happening. Then the shift would change and I wouldn't hear what she had been able to find and the day would come to an end. Finally, on the sixth day there was a bus crash outside Oxford and the ward was told to clear 15 beds. I still did not have my brace. The nurses said I'd be more comfortable in the Nuffield - it was a specialist hospital and I'd have a private room because I might be carrying bacteria from JR. I wasn't convinced. Fortunately, as the management was organising my transfer, the consultant appeared and told them that I could not be moved without a brace. That was the necessary spur. Two women arrived from the plaster room, smiling and stressed. As they pushed my bed along it emerged that they had been spending a significant part of the week wheeling patients around the hospital as there weren't enough porters. It felt like dangerous chaos. Doctors were doing the work of nurses and nurses were doing the portering. For six days I took a precious bed and four people to turn me every few hours because I wasn't fitted with a brace. It was clear that this was no longer a simple question of injection of funds. I had the impression that the hospital had been in this state for so long that the whole culture of care was crumbling, that its efficacy was more often determined by chance, and that it will now take a lot more than money to turn things around.",

A basic tier of programme regulation governing traditional issues relating to content, including privacy and taste and decenc,y will apply to every channel. But a more severe code of practice will apply to public services broadcasters - the BBC and Channel 4. However, in an unexpected move, the governmen will ask the BBC along with commercial broadcasters' public service commitments, to draw up detailed programming policy statements and regulatory arrangements to make the new three-tier system work. This leaves the BBC board of governors' role as the chief guardian of content across TV and radio untouched. The BBC is expected to argue that with its programming and operational review for the annual report, and statement of promises to viewers and listeners which is reviewed and updated yearly, it already has effective regulatory mechanisms in place. The role of the BBC governors as the body responsible for policing the corporation's public service commitments was believed to have been seriously under threat. Culture secretary Chris Smith was thought to have been particularly keen to end the BBC's self-regulatory powers, after run-ins with chairman Sir Christopher Bland over the 9pm news move. But No 10 and the Department of Trade and Industry are believed to have argued against a major confrontation with the BBC ahead of a May 2001 election.

The company, owned by General Motors, blamed \"rapidly changing\" European market conditions and over-capacity for the decision to stop building cars at the Bedfordshire plant. The jobs will go over the next 15 months, with workers offered what the company called a \"very reasonable\" redundancy package. Vauxhall made the Vectra at the plant and workers had been assured that that car's replacement would be made at Luton. That work will now be carried out in Germany. Company chairman Nick Reilly said the decision, taken at the company's European headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland, was necessary to retain competitive manufacturing in the UK. But Luton South MP Margaret Moran told BBC Radio 4's World at One that it was: \"A devastating announcement for the local economy, and one which we are going to fight all the way.\" Ms Moran said that she had already spoken to the trade and industry secretary Stephen Byers about a possible rescue plan and was confident that the car manufacturing jobs could be kept in the town. She added: \"I think that we will be able to put together a package which will be able to secure most, if not all, of the jobs that we need to in Luton. \"But that doesn't absolve Vauxhall Luton, or GM in particular, of their responsibilities and the assurances which they gave us less than two years ago about the future of the Vauxhall plant.\" The government itself has pledged a \"rapid response\".

      "bodyText": "Internet regulation is still very much a grey area and something that is made even cloudier by the global nature of the internet and the pending law deriving from Electronic Commerce Directive from the European Parliament. The biggest regulatory issue on the internet is that of copyright. However, with increasing progress being made towards broadcasting TV-like pictures via websites, there is a growing concern that users will gain access to inappropriate programming that is not governed by a watershed. The need for regulation on the internet can be illustrated by last summer's Big Brother programme, which was broadcast live on the internet. The producers of the Channel 4 show voluntarily applied television standards, including the 9pm watershed, to govern what video pictures of the reality game show they put out. The ITC has statutory responsibility to regulate television programmes broadcast over the internet, but not programmes made specifically for the internet. The ITC has no power, for instance, to stop individuals broadcasting from webcams. Regulation in this area will be far from straightforward to implement, given the lack of national boundaries for the internet. Any proposals on internet regulation in the white paper will have to take account of European legislation. The Electronic Commerce Directive, which is currently going through the European Parliament, will provide protection for internet service providers in the event of libel action. Once the law goes through, ISPs will only be able to be sued for defamation or breach of copyright if they ignore repeated complaints about content. The Periodical Publishers Association (PPA) wants to see the communications white paper address measures to protect its members' copyright, given that millions of pounds are being lost each year through copyright infringement. This is what has been achieved so far in internet regulation: The ITC joined forces with the BSC in October 1999 with a mission to look at ways in which the internet could be regulated by the two bodies. However, it concluded a few months later that technical solutions to protect consumers existed and might be sufficient. At the outset there was support for some form of external control from focus groups, but ultimately the consumers polled realised that software can help parental supervision. Since then, concern has intensified that there is too much contentious material on the internet. In a recent case a French court stopped Yahoo from selling Nazi memorabilia on its site. Also there are fears that paedophiles lurk in every chat room, following a case in the UK this autumn involving a child abuser posing as a teenager. However the government proceeds, regulation can no longer be media-specific. Two years ago the arguments centred on computers versus television. But now the boundaries have been blurred so much so that internet content can be accessed via a PC, TV or even a mobile phone. The ITC also looked at interactive TV, but concluded that regulation was not workable and the best approach was a light touch and a flexible regulatory approach. At the time it was said that a new code specifically to cover interactive services was not yet appropriate but could change as the market grows and viewers' use and experience increases.",

      "bodyText": "Online bank Egg has lost Tony Anderson, the high-profile marketeer it poached from EasyJet earlier this year. The move is a blow to Egg, which is under pressure from shareholders to find new revenue streams to subsidise its loss-making online banking operation. Mr Anderson had been hired from EasyJet to transform Egg's brand from an online bank into a broad-based retailer. Egg confirmed that Mr Anderson, its retail marketing director, had left last week and that he had not yet been replaced. Mr Anderson declined to comment on his future plans. It is likely he became frustrated with Egg's changes in business strategy following its disappointing float earlier this year. Egg's central marketing function has done little advertising for its shopping arm and, at the end of November, admitted it was considering opening high street outlets to boost its brand presence. With its distinct brand of weird and offbeat advertising, Egg has become one of the best-known brands in the UK, but its heavy \u00a330m ad spend, combined with highly competitive banking rates, helped generate a \u00a3115m loss in the nine months to September. Mr Anderson was originally charged with generating new retail revenues to offset this heavy outlay. In order to make money, Egg has to cross-sell new products to its 1.2m-strong customer base. Director of brand communications Tony Williams has talked of Egg competing with heavyweight online retail brands Amazon, Tesco and Yahoo. While at EasyJet, Mr Anderson was responsible for developing the Easy brand from airlines into internet cafes and beyond. He was the right-hand man to owner Stelios Haji-Ioannou. At Egg he was a victim of the collapse of dot.com stocks which failed to raise Egg the sort of money it expected from its float. Analysts now believe just 3m people will be banking online by the end of this year, compared with earlier estimates of 5m. Last month Egg began trialling a service that lets people shop on the net without giving their credit card details with the intention of launching the service next year.",

      "bodyText": "The government has rejected outright attempts by the advertising industry to regulate TV and radio commercials. Under the proposals unveiled in today's communications white paper, the new umbrella watchdog, the Office of Communications, will take principal responsibility for regulating advertising in the broadcast media. The news will come as a disappointment to the advertising industry, which had been lobbying for a self-regulatory system for broadcast advertising. However, it will be welcomed by consumer groups who believe advertisers should remain independently regulated. Under the existing system, the Independent Television Commission is responsible for regulating all television advertising, while the Radio Authority oversees all radio commercials. But all print and poster advertising is policed under a self-regulatory body, the Advertising Standards Authority, which is industry-funded. The ASA has been criticised in the past for being a lame organisation. Earlier this year the Advertising Association, the industry body that represents the UK's advertisers, submitted proposals for broadcast advertising to be controlled on the same regulatory basis as press and posters. The AA believed the convergence of broadcasting and telecommunications would create a need for more flexibility and speed, which only a self-regulatory system could provide. The white paper will also set out plans to keep the existing controls on religious advertising and programmes. And the current ban on political advertising on television will also remain in place.",

      "bodyText": "Neil Hamilton's case for depriving Mohamed Al Fayed of his cash for questions libel victory was \"so flimsy\" that it did not require factual rebuttal, the court of appeal heard today. Mr Hamilton had sued the Harrods boss over claims made in a January 1997 Channel 4 Dispatches programme that he had corruptly demanded and accepted cash payments, gift vouchers and a free holiday at the Paris Ritz in return for asking parliamentary questions on behalf of Harrods. Opening his case on behalf of Mr Fayed, Michael Beloff QC said that it was recognised as a fundamental principle of the common law that where a litigant had obtained a judgment in a court, he was entitled not to be deprived of it without \"very solid grounds\". Mr Beloff said: \"The grounds for depriving Mr Fayed of the jury verdict are not only not solid - they are indeed on their very face so flimsy as not to require factual rebuttal.\" He also told Lord Phillips, the master of the rolls, Lord Justice Sedley and Lady Justice Hale that they should reject Mr Hamilton's application to admit fresh evidence about allegedly stolen legal documents and refuse him permission to appeal the jury verdict - without hearing evidence from Mr Fayed himself. Even if the appeal judges were to find that the trial judge, Mr Justice Morland, and the jury were misled a year ago, the most that 51-year-old Mr Hamilton would be entitled to was a retrial, Mr Beloff said. \"It would certainly not be in the public interest for him to obtain a verdict in his favour at this particular juncture.\" Earlier, Mr Hamilton and his wife Christine listened as Mr Hamilton's counsel, Anthony Boswood QC, said that Mr Fayed was \"like one of those Olympic athletes who has been found to have cheated after receiving his medal\". He added: \"He should be deprived of his medal and banned for life.\" Mr Boswood said that the verdict should be set aside and judgment entered for Mr Hamilton, who would have to consider whether to pursue damages, given his acceptance that such a judgement would not clear his name. The costs orders imposed on Mr Hamilton, who faced \"imminent bankruptcy\", should also be set aside and Mr Fayed ordered to pay his costs, he said. Dismissing the allegations as a pack of lies, Mr Hamilton faced an estimated \u00a32m costs bill at the case's close, but claims that he would probably not have lost if the judge and jury had known that Mr Fayed was involved in paying \u00a310,000 for legal documents stolen from dustbins outside the chambers of Mr Hamilton's lawyers. Mr Fayed, who denies the allegations, was guilty of \"gross impropriety\" sufficient to invalidate the trial, said Mr Boswood. The court should attach no weight to his bare denial without him undergoing cross-examination, he said. Mr Boswood said: \"This is a case of procedural fraud or collateral fraud or abuse of process of the utmost seriousness involving theft of counsel's prodigiously detailed notes for cross-examination of the very witnesses whose corroborative evidence the judge evidently considered of prime importance to Mr Fayed's case.\" The appeal court, he said, could not simply decline to act on the grounds that they were immaterial and that Mr Fayed would have won anyway. The hearing continues.

      "bodyText": "The long-awaited relaxation of cross-media ownership rules has failed to materialise in today's communications white paper. Instead, the Department for Trade and Industry will \"invite comments\" on reforming the guidelines, which include a ban on newspaper owners with a market share of 20% or more from holding an ITV, Channel 5 or radio franchise. Industry observers hoped the paper would introduce the principle of \"share of voice\", allowing companies to straddle all forms of media. This would have allowed the combination of broadcast audience and advertising share and newspaper circulation figures into a single points system. However, it appears that the government has been caught between big media players who wanted more flexible rules, and the smaller companies who wanted protection from predators. The uncertainty has filtered through to proposed changes in newspaper and radio guidelines, which were the focus of stiff lobbying from interested parties. The DTI said it will \"consider a lighter approach for newspaper mergers\", after current guidelines effectively scuppered the Daily Mail and Daily Telegraph's chances of buying the Express newspaper group. Both newspapers would have been referred to competition watchdogs, hampering the chances of a quick deal. Commercial radio broadcasters will also be left frustrated, as the document delivered vague promises on changes to ownership guidelines. This could force big players such as Capital Radio to delay plans to reduce the number of major radio broadcasters from 12 to three. Consolidation is more likely at ITN, which is co-owned by Granada Media, Reuters, Carlton Communications, the Daily Mail &amp; General Trust and United News &amp; Media. The paper announced a possible relaxation of the 20% ownership limit on ITN, which could encourage United to sell its stake in the news supplier to a partner.",

The communications white paper, to be published later today, will scrap the current rule that bars any one ITV company controlling more than a 15% share of the total TV audience. It will also do away with the law that bars any one company owning the two London franchises. This will open the way for Carlton to own both its London weekday franchise and the LWT weekend licence, currently owned by Granada. And it would now be possible for both Carlton and Granada to consolidate their existing franchises into one single powerful ITV company operating in England. The white paper will also confirm the demise of TV watchdogs and regulators in the commercial sector. The Broadcasting Standards Commission and Independent Television Commission will both be scrapped and subsumed under a new umbrella regulator called Ofcom. Critics will say the demise of ITV as a network of 15 individual TV stations will be a blow for plurality and diversity. However, the government will try to reassure viewers' interests by putting consumer interests at the heart of Ofcom. It hopes to see legislation on the statute books by 2003. The government is also considering scrapping the rules barring any one company owning more than 20% of ITN. The proposals on the single ITV company have not won the wholehearted approval of the City.

They are appointed by the Queen on recommendation from government ministers on a part-time, non-executive basis. <strong> What is its current remit? </strong><br> It is responsible for ensuring the BBC is accountable to Parliament, licence payers and audiences. Governors hold BBC management to account for their performance against agreed strategy and objectives, including compliance with the BBC Charter. The governors also appoint the BBC director general and other senior managers. They meet monthly. <strong> How long have the BBC governors been in existence?</strong><br> Since January 1 1927, when the British Broadcasting Company became the British Broadcasting Corporation. </p> <p><strong> INDEPENDENT TELEVISION COMMISSION </strong> </p> <p><strong> Who heads it?</strong><br> Chief executive Patricia Hodgson heads the ITC's full-time staff. The former BBC director of public policy joined the commercial TV sector regulator at the start of September. Sir Robin Biggam is chairman. <br><strong> How many employees?</strong><br> There are 200 full-time staff, but around 20 posts are expected to go as part of restructuring in anticipation of white paper. The commission itself has 11 members, including Mr Biggam, who are appointed by the secretary of state for Culture, Media and Sport. <br> <strong> What is its remit?</strong><br> It is responsible for licensing and regulating the programming and advertising on UK commercial TV services, including ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5 and cable and satellite channels. The commission itself meets monthly . The regulator's permanent staff monitors UK commercial TV output, processes viewer complaints and handles day-to-day relations with broadcasters. <br> <strong> How long has the ITC been going? </strong><br> The ITC took over regulating commercial TV from the Independent Broadcasting Authority on January 1 1993.<br> <br> </p> <p> <strong> ADVERTISING STANDARDS AUTHORITY </strong> </p> <p><strong>What is its remit?</strong><br> The ASA is the regulatory body for all non-broadcast ads that appear in the UK. Its duty is to ensure that they are \"legal, decent, honest and truthful\". It is independent of both the government and the advertising industry, and its work is funded by a levy on advertising and direct mail expenditure. However, it is widely seen as toothless, making decisions long after controvserial poster campaigns have gone. <br> <strong> Who heads it up?</strong><br> The ASA is chaired by Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank. The director general is Christopher Graham, a former BBC executive. <br> <strong> How many employees?</strong><br> 70<br> <strong> How long has it been around?</strong><br> The ASA was set up in 1962.<br> <br> </p> <p><strong> BROADCASTING STANDARDS COMMISSION </strong> </p> <p><strong>Who heads it?</strong><br> The resignation of Lord Holme in October following a sex scandal has left it without a head. <br> <strong> How many staff?</strong><br>It employs 30 staff. In addition there are 13 commissioners who make judgements on complaints and strategy. <br> <strong> Its remit </strong><br> The BSC writes codes of guidance on standards of taste and decency, impartiality and privacy covering the whole broadcasting landscape, taking in satellite, cable and terrestrial television and radio. It has some statutory powers to force broadcasters to apologise when they get it seriously wrong, particularly when it comes to invasion of privacy. <br> <strong> When was it established?</strong><br> The Broadcasting Standards Commission was formed from the merger of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission and the statutory body, the Broadcasting Standards Council, in 1998.<br> <br> </p> <p><strong> OFTEL </strong> </p> <p><strong> Who heads it?</strong> <br> David Edmonds, director general of communications. <br> <strong> How many employees?</strong> <br>197. <br> <strong> Its remit</strong><br>Oftel is the watchdog for the UK telecoms industry, ensuring that customers get the best deals in terms of quality, choice and value for money. The best way to do this has been through ensuring a healthy level of competition between telecoms companies, leading to recent clashes with BT over opening up telephone exchanges for high-tech broadband internet services. <br> <strong> When was it founded?</strong> <br> 1984<br> <br> </p> <p><strong> RADIOCOMMUNICATIONS AGENCY </strong> </p> <p><strong> Who heads it?</strong><br> David Hendon, chief executive. <br> <strong> How many employees? </strong><br> 550. <br> <strong> Its remit </strong><br> The Radiocommunications Agency manages radio frequencies in the UK, operating within the Department of Trade and Industry.

The governors also appoint the BBC director general and other senior managers. They meet monthly. How long have the BBC governors been in existence? Since January 1 1927, when the British Broadcasting Company became the British Broadcasting Corporation. INDEPENDENT TELEVISION COMMISSION Who heads it? Chief executive Patricia Hodgson heads the ITC's full-time staff. The former BBC director of public policy joined the commercial TV sector regulator at the start of September. Sir Robin Biggam is chairman. How many employees? There are 200 full-time staff, but around 20 posts are expected to go as part of restructuring in anticipation of white paper. The commission itself has 11 members, including Mr Biggam, who are appointed by the secretary of state for Culture, Media and Sport. What is its remit? It is responsible for licensing and regulating the programming and advertising on UK commercial TV services, including ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5 and cable and satellite channels. The commission itself meets monthly . The regulator's permanent staff monitors UK commercial TV output, processes viewer complaints and handles day-to-day relations with broadcasters. How long has the ITC been going? The ITC took over regulating commercial TV from the Independent Broadcasting Authority on January 1 1993. ADVERTISING STANDARDS AUTHORITY What is its remit? The ASA is the regulatory body for all non-broadcast ads that appear in the UK. Its duty is to ensure that they are \"legal, decent, honest and truthful\". It is independent of both the government and the advertising industry, and its work is funded by a levy on advertising and direct mail expenditure. However, it is widely seen as toothless, making decisions long after controvserial poster campaigns have gone. Who heads it up? The ASA is chaired by Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank. The director general is Christopher Graham, a former BBC executive. How many employees? 70 How long has it been around? The ASA was set up in 1962. BROADCASTING STANDARDS COMMISSION Who heads it? The resignation of Lord Holme in October following a sex scandal has left it without a head. How many staff? It employs 30 staff. In addition there are 13 commissioners who make judgements on complaints and strategy. Its remit The BSC writes codes of guidance on standards of taste and decency, impartiality and privacy covering the whole broadcasting landscape, taking in satellite, cable and terrestrial television and radio. It has some statutory powers to force broadcasters to apologise when they get it seriously wrong, particularly when it comes to invasion of privacy. When was it established? The Broadcasting Standards Commission was formed from the merger of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission and the statutory body, the Broadcasting Standards Council, in 1998. OFTEL Who heads it? David Edmonds, director general of communications. How many employees? 197. Its remit Oftel is the watchdog for the UK telecoms industry, ensuring that customers get the best deals in terms of quality, choice and value for money. The best way to do this has been through ensuring a healthy level of competition between telecoms companies, leading to recent clashes with BT over opening up telephone exchanges for high-tech broadband internet services. When was it founded? 1984 RADIOCOMMUNICATIONS AGENCY Who heads it? David Hendon, chief executive. How many employees? 550. Its remit The Radiocommunications Agency manages radio frequencies in the UK, operating within the Department of Trade and Industry. It ensures that there is enough space on the airwaves for commercial radio, mobile phones and wireless broadband services. It also negotiates with European counterparts to arrange harmonisation of frequencies. When was it founded? 1990.",

Of this, the government has committed \u00a315m to four initiatives called health demonstration projects with the aim of developing good practice in its priority areas - child/maternal health, sexual health, cancer and coronary heart disease. An additional \u00a31m annually has been earmarked for the establishment of an Institute of Public Health for Scotland, based in Glasgow.</p> <p><strong>Comparative health spending</strong><br> According to the Scottish Parliament's research service, spending per head on health in Scotland in 1999-2000 was about one-fifth more than the UK average. The figures show that, according to Westminster projections, the amount actually spent on health in Scotland will increase from \u00a31,059 per head in 2000-01 to \u00a31,150 in 2001-02.</p> <p><strong>Staff shortages</strong><br> In common with the rest of the UK, Scotland suffers shortages of doctors. Scotland has been without an operational heart transplant unit since the departure of transplant surgeon Surendra Naik in May. NHS trust bosses are attempting to recruit two consultants with the aim of re-opening the unit at Glasgow Royal Infirmary in the spring of 2001. In April 1999 there were more than 1,200 full-time equivalent vacancies for nurses in the NHS in Scotland. Some 450 of these were unfilled for three months or more.</p> <p><strong>Heart disease, cancer and strokes</strong><br> Heart disease is responsible for 40% of all deaths in Scotland. Despite a 50% drop in the death rate since 1980 (656 per 100,000 down to 332 per 100,000) Scotland remains top of international league tables for the \"big three\" killers: heart disease, cancer and strokes. Heart disease has now replaced cancer as the UK's biggest threat to women's health and here too the north/south differential remains. The premature death rate (before age 75) is 70% higher for women in Scotland than in East Anglia.</p> <p><strong>Drug use</strong><br> The number of injecting drug users in Scotland has risen by 50% in the last six years to around 30,000. The knock-on impact on health services is considerable, with the number of new patients attending drug misuse services rising more than 300% from 2,980 in 1992-93 to 9,500 in 1998-99. A recent survey by greater Glasgow health board estimates that there are more than 15,000 drug addicts in the city - of whom 90% inject heroin. In the city centre alone, 43% of adults are believe to have some kind of drug problem.</p> <p><strong>Diet and nutrition</strong><br> The legacy of the traditional Scots' fatty diet is revealed in latest statistics showing 75% of men and 62% of women over the age of 45 are overweight or obese. The Scottish health survey reveals that less than half of adult Scots eat cooked green vegetables five times a week. </p> <p><strong>Smoking</strong><br> One-third of all adults in Scotland are regular cigarette smokers - more than in either England or Wales (33% in Scotland compared to 29% in Great Britain). Smoking rates among professional workers have halved over the past 20 years, but smoking is now concentrated among low-income groups. Roughly half of the men and women in the lowest income quarter in Scotland (49%) smoke, a figure which has hardly changed since the 1970s.</p> <p><strong>Teenage pregnancy</strong><br> More than 9,000 teenagers become pregnant each year in Scotland and half of those pregnancies end in termination. The government's target is to reduce the pregnancy rate among 13-15 year olds by 20% by the year 2010. Teenage pregnancy rates in Scotland average 41 per 1,000 girls, while the average rate for teenage abortions was 34 for every 1,000 girls. Dundee tops Scotland's teenage conception rates with nearly 80 out of every 1,000 girls aged between 15 and 17. This is marginally less than the London borough of Southwark, which heads the statistical table for England and Wales with a pregnancy rate of 85 girls for every 1,000 - twice the national average.</p>",

What exactly does it mean? When I asked Community Service Volunteers, one of the four \"citizenship organisations\" behind the American-inspired handbook, I was told it was about \"active, participatory learning. How students can participate in an active way.\" I was assured that the handbook dealt with \"very real stuff\" and that I would find concrete examples that would be useful to teachers. </p> <p>But flicking through Active Citizenship, any concrete examples that do emerge bear a close resemblance to the type of activities in which management consultants indulge on training weekends away in the Welsh hills. \"Self-empowerment through reflection\", keeping a journal and writing a \"mission statement\" are the suggested lessons. Predictably, there is a great deal of role-playing. One of the most practical tasks is 105 \"key citizenship words for use with weekly spelling lists\", including community, concerns, sharing and, of course, citizenship. </p> <p>The project is awash with false sentiment. Each chapter contains a scattering of quotes rather like a Patience Strong calendar. \"Working together works\" is one motto, followed by \"Anything one person can imagine, other people can make real,\" and \"If you can dream it, you can do it,\" attributed to none other than Walt Disney. It's as if the pedagogical experience is being reduced to the ditty inside a greeting card. </p> <p>But the real difficulty with such a touchy-feely approach to teaching is how reductive it is of very complex ideas and very messy young, emerging minds and emotions. The student guide section encourages \"an exploration of yourself\". An avowed aim is \"schooling the emotions\". But can emotions be schooled? And if so, which emotions and when? Love, anger and fear are not easily explicable one-dimensional things, but complex and often self-contradictory. Ironically, oversimplistic emotions are often signs that a child has a special educational need, rather than that he or she is particularly well educated. </p> <p>The underlying, if unstated, thesis behind such an approach must be that there are correct emotions to have at certain times and in certain situations. But you can't get your emotions right or wrong like you can your Tudor kings and queens. They just don't work like that. Emotions are sometimes utterly inappropriate, yet rightly so. A child whose sibling dies, for example, may well feel more anger than grief. Even adults get their feelings in a twist. A woman who is desperate to have a child may, on getting pregnant, feel distraught. But although inappropriate, none of these emotions are wrong. They just reveal how complex human reactions are in any situation. </p> <p>\"Self-esteem\" is one of the core attributes that citizenship classes will aim to develop in children. But even if you feel good about yourself, it doesn't necessarily follow that you will do good to others. Surely a child can be very pleased with themselves indeed yet display no empathy whatsoever for anyone else. Self-esteem is no less complex an emotion - with no fewer facets - than any other. </p> <p>Active Citizenship is not prescriptive, and much of what it says is common sense. But perhaps the most worrying aspect of this emphasis on separating out citizenship as a subject in itself is the presumption that children are currently taught something utterly different and devoid of much of the citizenship lobby's laudable aims. Surely well-taught history English and science are about citizenship. A recent series of history lessons at my local primary school looked at the life of Martin Luther King. Seven-year-olds learned King's \"I have a dream\" speech and acted out the story of African-American seamstress Rosa Parks, who was arrested after refusing to give up her bus seat for a white person in segregated Alabama in 1955.

Nor is participatory citizenship: only half of American citizens cast a vote in their presidential election. </p> <p>And perhaps therein is a lesson for Blunkett. Teaching citizenship does not necessarily guarantee that those taught will begin to participate more fully in the democratic process. As in America, it might have the opposite effect to that intended. It might make those newly educated in citizenship realise that there is little point in voting at all.

The date of his trial was fixed for May 14 next year.</p> <p>Lord Archer stood in dock in the number one court and pleaded not guilty to five charges - two of perjury, two of perverting the course of justice and one of using a false instrument, relating to diaries used in his libel trial against the Daily Star in 1987.</p> <p>Lord Archer, 60, appeared with his former friend, television producer Ted Francis, 67, who faces a single charge of perverting the course of justice. He denied the charge.</p> <p>It is alleged that Lord Archer, accused under the name of Jeffrey Howard Archer, asked Mr Francis to lie for him in order to provide a false alibi for the high-profile libel case.</p> <p>Bespectacled Lord Archer, dressed in a dark navy suit, blue shirt and dark tie stood motionless, staring directly ahead as he was arraigned. He replied not guilty to each charge as it was put to him by the court clerk. He had arrived at the court in a chauffeur-driven green BMW and left immediately after the hearing without comment. His wife Mary was not with him.</p> <p>The recorder of London, Judge Michael Hyam, told both men that they were granted bail, but if they failed to attend their trial without reasonable cause they faced a fine or imprisonment.</p> <p>The charges they pleaded not guilty to today were as follows:</p> <p>Lord Archer:</p> <p>\u0095 That, on a day between the December 22 1986 and April 7 1987, in relation to an action commenced by Lord Archer against Express Newspapers Plc and Lloyd Turner, who had said that Lord Archer had sexual intercourse with prostitute Monica Coughlan on September 10 1986, he procured Edward John Francis to provide his solicitors with a version of events in relation to the evening of September 9 1986 which he knew to be false.</p> <p>\u0095 Perverting the course of justice between March 26 1986 and July 7 1987, in relation to diaries relating to September 1986, in that he failed to reveal the existence of his main office diary and provided Angela Peppiatt with a blank diary which he instructed her with details to write in the diary. The new diary was then handed to his solicitors for use in the court case.</p> <p>\u0095 Using a false instrument under the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act: That between March 26 1986 and July 7 1987, Lord Archer used the A4 diary with the intention of inducing the newspaper and its editor to accept it as genuine.</p> <p>\u0095 Perjury: On June 23 1987, he made a statement under oath for use in judicial proceedings that the diary and a list of appointments were the only documents of that type which had been in his possession.</p> <p>\u0095 Perjury: On the July 8 1987 as a sworn witness in judicial proceedings at the high court, made a false statement that the diary was in existence before October 26 1986.</p> <p>Mr Francis faces one charge as follows:</p> <p>\u0095 Perverting the course of justice that between December 22 1986 and March 27 1987 when he agreed to provide and later provided solicitors acting for Lord Archer, a version of events on September 9 1986, which he knew to be false.</p> <p>The trial is expected to last two to three weeks, but possibly running into a fourth.</p> <p><b>Related stories</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4071642,00.html\">4 October 2000: Archer bailed on 5 counts</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4099676,00.html\"> Interview: Welcome to my world - the Observer</a><br><a href=\"  http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,3975616,00.html  Review: Would you buy a used plotline from this man? - the Observer</A>  <BR><A HREF=\" http: www.booksunlimited.co.uk top10s top10 0,6109,99328,00.html\">Jeffrey Archer's favourite political books - Books Unlimited</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4070022,00.html\">Review: Jeffrey bares all (even a spotty back) reports <b>Mark Lawson</b></a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Former deputy chairman of the Conservative party Lord Archer denied at the Old Bailey today that he had asked a friend to lie for him during a libel case. The millionaire author and playwright was making his first appearance at the court for a preliminary hearing. The date of his trial was fixed for May 14 next year. Lord Archer stood in dock in the number one court and pleaded not guilty to five charges - two of perjury, two of perverting the course of justice and one of using a false instrument, relating to diaries used in his libel trial against the Daily Star in 1987. Lord Archer, 60, appeared with his former friend, television producer Ted Francis, 67, who faces a single charge of perverting the course of justice. He denied the charge. It is alleged that Lord Archer, accused under the name of Jeffrey Howard Archer, asked Mr Francis to lie for him in order to provide a false alibi for the high-profile libel case. Bespectacled Lord Archer, dressed in a dark navy suit, blue shirt and dark tie stood motionless, staring directly ahead as he was arraigned. He replied not guilty to each charge as it was put to him by the court clerk. He had arrived at the court in a chauffeur-driven green BMW and left immediately after the hearing without comment. His wife Mary was not with him. The recorder of London, Judge Michael Hyam, told both men that they were granted bail, but if they failed to attend their trial without reasonable cause they faced a fine or imprisonment. The charges they pleaded not guilty to today were as follows: Lord Archer: \u0095 That, on a day between the December 22 1986 and April 7 1987, in relation to an action commenced by Lord Archer against Express Newspapers Plc and Lloyd Turner, who had said that Lord Archer had sexual intercourse with prostitute Monica Coughlan on September 10 1986, he procured Edward John Francis to provide his solicitors with a version of events in relation to the evening of September 9 1986 which he knew to be false. \u0095 Perverting the course of justice between March 26 1986 and July 7 1987, in relation to diaries relating to September 1986, in that he failed to reveal the existence of his main office diary and provided Angela Peppiatt with a blank diary which he instructed her with details to write in the diary. The new diary was then handed to his solicitors for use in the court case. \u0095 Using a false instrument under the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act: That between March 26 1986 and July 7 1987, Lord Archer used the A4 diary with the intention of inducing the newspaper and its editor to accept it as genuine. \u0095 Perjury: On June 23 1987, he made a statement under oath for use in judicial proceedings that the diary and a list of appointments were the only documents of that type which had been in his possession. \u0095 Perjury: On the July 8 1987 as a sworn witness in judicial proceedings at the high court, made a false statement that the diary was in existence before October 26 1986. Mr Francis faces one charge as follows: \u0095 Perverting the course of justice that between December 22 1986 and March 27 1987 when he agreed to provide and later provided solicitors acting for Lord Archer, a version of events on September 9 1986, which he knew to be false. The trial is expected to last two to three weeks, but possibly running into a fourth.

      "byline": "Libby Brooks",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>She could be porcelain. Supine, naked but for a pearl choker and bracelet, this image of the English model Sophie Dahl appears on billboards and in magazines across the country advertising the Yves Saint Laurent fragrance, Opium.</p> <p>Her head is thrown back, exposing her lovely throat. She cups one breast. Her emerald-shaded eyes are closed, but her legs are open, feet arching into opulent gold stilettoes. The pose is strikingly erotic. It has power - to excite and, it would seem, to offend.</p> <p>Since the advert first appeared last month, the Advertising Standards Authority has received more than 200 complaints about it, significantly more than any other advertisment this year. From a Welsh assembly member in Cardiff to road safety officers in Yorkshire, debate is raging over the suitability of the poster, taken by the celebrity photographer Stephen Meisel, for public sites. And in France, the campaigning feminist group Chiennes de Garde (Guard Bitches) has condemned the advert as \"porn chic\".</p> <p>The viewing public is inured to the use of flesh to attract attention. As a nation, we are used to breasts. So what is it about this particular photograph that causes such offence? What is this image about: ecstasy or exploitation, pleasure or danger, the watcher or the watched? In essence, it begs one question: what does she want? To be fucked? By you? By herself? The reason the photograph of Dahl illicits such a powerful reaction is that it strikes at the centre of the complex, uncomfortable relationship between gender and desire.</p> <p>What is desire, in all its sticky, sexy forms? It is a memory, and a vision. It is engulfing, and unselfconscious. It is also about self-determination, about taking responsiblity for, and responding to, one's sexual impulses. But taking the initiative is a trade-off for many women: bursting the unbearable bubble of sexual tension, taking control on a more practical front where pregnancy or safety are concerned, but seldom wholeheartedly embracing sexual appetite. And it requires more than a flipping of the binary vision of male and female as doer and done-to to change this.</p> <p>Female sexuality, like the female body, is generally construed as passive. Compare Dahl's hungrily parted legs with the Barbie doll blankness of Claudia Schiffer, presently gracing 30ft-high banners across London, advertising the clothing store Hennes. Schiffer is the embodiment of female sexual passivity. In her pretty pastel bra and knickers she is slutty, but not too slutty, eager to please, easy to satisfy - and as challenging as a blow-up doll.</p> <p>The image of Dahl is threatening because she looks as if she knows what she wants and, for all the progressive talk of bedroom liberation, that continues to alarm us. Popular culture now offers the superficially subversive notion of woman as sexual aggressor. But in the private sphere, we still teach girls a romantic narrative of which sex forms one element, while teaching their male peers about a discreet act that underpins masculinity.</p> <p>So how much of this passivity is constructed by social imperatives, and how much is an unconscious response to them? Jacques Lacan, the French psychoanalyst, once said that women want to be wanted, not to be loved. In the sexual realm, this could be taken to mean that women are so uneasy about desiring directly, whether through shame or ignorance, that they can only experience it in a mediated form.</p> <p>Essentially, wanting to be wanted stems from a desire for power that has been transformed and ultimately hidden. Despite the advances of feminism, female power continues to be experienced as dangerous or exotic, and not something that can be directly expressed.</p> <p>So we find our power in the image we project rather than in our own actions. Appearance - whether that is looking good or acting sweet - trumps what we actually want for ourselves; reliance on other people to provide our own feelings of worth traduces emotional authenticity.</p> <p>If women have so little confidence in their desires, then it is not surprising that they tend to present themselves as less sexual beings compared to men. Most national surveys show that women want sex less often than men, experience orgasm less often and find greater satisfaction in emotional intimacy than genital sex.</p> <p>The pop psychologists would have it that women are cuddle-obsessed, finding it impossible to separate sex from love. The evolutionary psychologists tell us that the higher male sex drive has an ancient Darwinian rationale. But do men and women experience desire differently?</p> <p>\"Women are said to have lower sex drives than men,\" writes Natalie Angier, the Pulitzer prize-winning science correspondent, \"yet they are universally punished if they display evidence to the contrary - if they disobey their 'natural' inclination towards a stifled libido.\"</p> <p>\"Women supposedly have a lower sex drive than men do, yet it is not low enough. No, there is still just enough of a lingering female infidelity impulse . . . to justify infibulation and purdah . . . How can we know what is 'natural' for us when we are treated as unnatural for wanting our lust, our freedom?\"</p> <p>Women may be more aware of their sexuality than ever before, but they continue to offer it an ambivalent embrace. How does that aped, or genuine, sexual confidence play out in the masque of flirtation? Although our sexual conversations are highly nuanced these days, negotiating the path from bar to bed can often feel like a war of attrition. Although chastity and sexual passivity are no longer openly feted, both men and women retain a lingering suspicion of promiscuous women. Especially among the younger generation, where girls' power is located in their ability to say no, and their weakness in the inability to do so effectively.</p> <p>Desire is also about greed - literally. Women are bad at admitting to hunger, constructed as we are as givers, not seekers, of pleasure. And if, as Naomi Wolf suggested in the Beauty Myth, dieting is the essence of contemporary femininity, are we starving ourselves of lust? Studies have consistently shown that with dietary deprivation, sexual interest dissipates, and fertility plummets. Meanwhile, self-consciousness is the enemy of desire. Erotic abandonment and fretting over the flatness of your tummy are mutually exclusive.</p> <p>Finally, women's desire has always been mediated through a male prism. From the pornography women share with their partners, to the way we are sold cars, the erotic landscape is overwhelmingly male. Our culture is suffused with the homogenous imagery that has come to represent What Turns Men On (though the reality of male desire doesn't necessarily conform).</p> <p>Although discussion of women's pleasure has lately entered the mainstream, it remains minimal and reductive: the saucy scandals of tabloid nymphets, advertisers who link ice cream and seduction, or the censoring of parodic \"laddish\" behaviour.</p> <p>Female sexuality remains a dark continent. Largely, women remain in a state of anxious comparison: wanting to be, envying and - yes, sometimes - desiring the male's object of desire. But I don't feel like that when I look at that photograph of Sophie Dahl. Personally, I think it's a beautiful, sexy image of a woman caught in a moment of pleasure. For all its high art allusions and anti-realist photographic tricks, it reminds me of what sex could actually look like, or what it can look like in fantasy.</p> <p>It is genuinely erotic in a way that all those other images that pretend to read our sexuality never succeed in being. It reminds us, in a society where our public representations of sex have become increasingly static, that desire is a vivid, transformative force. But perhaps it is so shocking to some people because of this very public exposure of a private interlude: the time when we were last, best touched.</p>",

      "bodyText": "She could be porcelain. Supine, naked but for a pearl choker and bracelet, this image of the English model Sophie Dahl appears on billboards and in magazines across the country advertising the Yves Saint Laurent fragrance, Opium. Her head is thrown back, exposing her lovely throat. She cups one breast. Her emerald-shaded eyes are closed, but her legs are open, feet arching into opulent gold stilettoes. The pose is strikingly erotic. It has power - to excite and, it would seem, to offend. Since the advert first appeared last month, the Advertising Standards Authority has received more than 200 complaints about it, significantly more than any other advertisment this year. From a Welsh assembly member in Cardiff to road safety officers in Yorkshire, debate is raging over the suitability of the poster, taken by the celebrity photographer Stephen Meisel, for public sites. And in France, the campaigning feminist group Chiennes de Garde (Guard Bitches) has condemned the advert as \"porn chic\". The viewing public is inured to the use of flesh to attract attention. As a nation, we are used to breasts. So what is it about this particular photograph that causes such offence? What is this image about: ecstasy or exploitation, pleasure or danger, the watcher or the watched? In essence, it begs one question: what does she want? To be fucked? By you? By herself? The reason the photograph of Dahl illicits such a powerful reaction is that it strikes at the centre of the complex, uncomfortable relationship between gender and desire. What is desire, in all its sticky, sexy forms? It is a memory, and a vision. It is engulfing, and unselfconscious. It is also about self-determination, about taking responsiblity for, and responding to, one's sexual impulses. But taking the initiative is a trade-off for many women: bursting the unbearable bubble of sexual tension, taking control on a more practical front where pregnancy or safety are concerned, but seldom wholeheartedly embracing sexual appetite. And it requires more than a flipping of the binary vision of male and female as doer and done-to to change this. Female sexuality, like the female body, is generally construed as passive. Compare Dahl's hungrily parted legs with the Barbie doll blankness of Claudia Schiffer, presently gracing 30ft-high banners across London, advertising the clothing store Hennes. Schiffer is the embodiment of female sexual passivity. In her pretty pastel bra and knickers she is slutty, but not too slutty, eager to please, easy to satisfy - and as challenging as a blow-up doll. The image of Dahl is threatening because she looks as if she knows what she wants and, for all the progressive talk of bedroom liberation, that continues to alarm us. Popular culture now offers the superficially subversive notion of woman as sexual aggressor. But in the private sphere, we still teach girls a romantic narrative of which sex forms one element, while teaching their male peers about a discreet act that underpins masculinity. So how much of this passivity is constructed by social imperatives, and how much is an unconscious response to them? Jacques Lacan, the French psychoanalyst, once said that women want to be wanted, not to be loved. In the sexual realm, this could be taken to mean that women are so uneasy about desiring directly, whether through shame or ignorance, that they can only experience it in a mediated form. Essentially, wanting to be wanted stems from a desire for power that has been transformed and ultimately hidden. Despite the advances of feminism, female power continues to be experienced as dangerous or exotic, and not something that can be directly expressed. So we find our power in the image we project rather than in our own actions. Appearance - whether that is looking good or acting sweet - trumps what we actually want for ourselves; reliance on other people to provide our own feelings of worth traduces emotional authenticity. If women have so little confidence in their desires, then it is not surprising that they tend to present themselves as less sexual beings compared to men. Most national surveys show that women want sex less often than men, experience orgasm less often and find greater satisfaction in emotional intimacy than genital sex. The pop psychologists would have it that women are cuddle-obsessed, finding it impossible to separate sex from love. The evolutionary psychologists tell us that the higher male sex drive has an ancient Darwinian rationale. But do men and women experience desire differently? \"Women are said to have lower sex drives than men,\" writes Natalie Angier, the Pulitzer prize-winning science correspondent, \"yet they are universally punished if they display evidence to the contrary - if they disobey their 'natural' inclination towards a stifled libido.\" \"Women supposedly have a lower sex drive than men do, yet it is not low enough. No, there is still just enough of a lingering female infidelity impulse . . . to justify infibulation and purdah . . . How can we know what is 'natural' for us when we are treated as unnatural for wanting our lust, our freedom?\" Women may be more aware of their sexuality than ever before, but they continue to offer it an ambivalent embrace. How does that aped, or genuine, sexual confidence play out in the masque of flirtation? Although our sexual conversations are highly nuanced these days, negotiating the path from bar to bed can often feel like a war of attrition. Although chastity and sexual passivity are no longer openly feted, both men and women retain a lingering suspicion of promiscuous women. Especially among the younger generation, where girls' power is located in their ability to say no, and their weakness in the inability to do so effectively. Desire is also about greed - literally. Women are bad at admitting to hunger, constructed as we are as givers, not seekers, of pleasure. And if, as Naomi Wolf suggested in the Beauty Myth, dieting is the essence of contemporary femininity, are we starving ourselves of lust? Studies have consistently shown that with dietary deprivation, sexual interest dissipates, and fertility plummets. Meanwhile, self-consciousness is the enemy of desire. Erotic abandonment and fretting over the flatness of your tummy are mutually exclusive. Finally, women's desire has always been mediated through a male prism. From the pornography women share with their partners, to the way we are sold cars, the erotic landscape is overwhelmingly male. Our culture is suffused with the homogenous imagery that has come to represent What Turns Men On (though the reality of male desire doesn't necessarily conform). Although discussion of women's pleasure has lately entered the mainstream, it remains minimal and reductive: the saucy scandals of tabloid nymphets, advertisers who link ice cream and seduction, or the censoring of parodic \"laddish\" behaviour. Female sexuality remains a dark continent. Largely, women remain in a state of anxious comparison: wanting to be, envying and - yes, sometimes - desiring the male's object of desire. But I don't feel like that when I look at that photograph of Sophie Dahl. Personally, I think it's a beautiful, sexy image of a woman caught in a moment of pleasure. For all its high art allusions and anti-realist photographic tricks, it reminds me of what sex could actually look like, or what it can look like in fantasy. It is genuinely erotic in a way that all those other images that pretend to read our sexuality never succeed in being. It reminds us, in a society where our public representations of sex have become increasingly static, that desire is a vivid, transformative force. But perhaps it is so shocking to some people because of this very public exposure of a private interlude: the time when we were last, best touched.",

Oxford's pack features the United States prop Ray Lehner, who has won 39 caps for the Eagles, and the Australian flanker Brett Robinson, who has led the ACT Brumbies in the Super 12 competition.

      "body": "<p>Cor blimey, Jimmy, half a mo - look you, up the canny apples and pears, like, bah gum. I'm terribly sorry. Aren't there just too many faux regional accents in that first barking sentence? Well, when the wonderful world of Disney sets a film in London, what can you expect but a chim-chiminee of stock British characterisations with scenery to match: Big Ben, Tower Bridge and immaculate red Routemaster buses. </p> <p>I know that 102 Dalmatians, the Kevin Lima-directed sequel to Disney's 101 Dalmatians, is meant to be a fairy tale. Yet I couldn't help feeling - sitting through this 94-minute dog, people and parrot caper - that this movie alone could put down every vain attempt by New Labour to make its whizzo, privatised, Wap-phone New Britain a US cartoon-style reality. For this, me ol' chinas, is how Uncle Sam, Mickey Mouse and global corporations based in Seattle or wherever must see little old England today: as up-to-date as Hector's House or the adventures of Rin-Tin-Tin. </p> <p>Both Dodie Smith's book 101 Dalmatians and the magical Disney cartoon it spawned in 1961 were set in London, too. In 102 Dalmatians, London is a city without a single high-rise building; where the chimes of Big Ben boom deafeningly (in reality they can barely be heard above the traffic); in which lovable cockney families (every one white) spend Sundays watching Punch and Judy shows (I ask you!); where the trains at foggy Green Park station are controlled by Victorian semaphore signals from a clapboard signal box. In Uncle Walt's London, it's either raining cats and dogs, pea-souped out or snowing. The working class is deferential and the train to Paris, from St Pancras rather than Waterloo, is a steam-hauled chocolate-and-cream Pullman. </p> <p>Yes, but it's only a story. Don't take it so literally. Try and be an echt film critic. You see, I've got the vocabulary. Still, they didn't need to change the locomotive at the head of the Paris-bound, dalmatian-filled, Orient Express halfway to Dover from Flying Scotsman to BR Class 5 number 73082, did they? Stop whingeing like a child over train-spottery details, and concentrate on the spotty dogs, camera angles and screenplay. Get a grip, as they say on set. Enter the seasonal spirit. This is a film for the kiddies, not for some la-la-long-haired aesthete who writes in this paper mostly about architecture, cities and design. Wolves, too, mind you. Yes, but you're watching dalmatians. Stick to the point. But dalmatians are famously bad with children and since the 101 Dalmatians was released a couple of years back, dog pounds in LA have been dogged with Dalmatians. I've warned you. Start being a proper film critic now, or no walkies. </p> <p>Here we go, then... Glenn Close as Cruella De Vil dressed in a wacky wardrobe of mad fur creations, designed by Anthony Powell, is a suitably diabolic pantomine witch, but the rest of the cast - animals aside - aren't very funny. Two thirds of the way through, I scribbled \"Goes on a bit\", but felt rather guilty for doing so. Perhaps children will love 102 Dalmatians, although I'm not too sure. Along with every other child I know, I loved the cartoon version, and 102 didn't seem a patch on it. </p> <p>Also, there were no children at the Odeon Leicester Square preview, just a pack of seen-it-all critics who would surely prefer to be reviewing some obscure out-of-focus Romanian masterpiece about a young woman tractor driver who falls in love with a reclusive existential poet who... or maybe Lassie Come Home. </p> <p>A thing of spots and patches, 102 Dalmatians does have some delicious moments. The denouement is gloriously messy: when the dogs, triumphing over the evil designs of Cruella De Vil and her camp couturier Jean Pierre Le Pelt ( jambonned into life a little too effortlessly by G\u00e9rard Depardieu) operate a Brobdingnagian baking machine that turns the dognapping villainess into a giant cake. A child's delight. </p> <p>Cruella steals the show, whether piloting her Panther De Ville limousine manically through Paris streets (Paris equals the Eiffel Tower, baguettes, poodles and Renault 4 taxis - Renault 4s? ) or staggering deliriously across Westminster Bridge and seeing the Houses of Parliament, Portcullis House and New Scotland Yard covered in spotted dalmatian fur. How she howls through her mansion, part Addams family house, part Sir John Soane's Museum (one for the architectural buffs). How she barks at a wavering Jean Pierre Le Pelt: \"Faint heart never won a fur lady.\" This line made me laugh, for the first time, an hour or so into the film. I began to write it down and then faced one of the difficulties of being a film critic: I couldn't see what my Biro was up to, and when I brought my notebook up to my eyes, I couldn't see the screen. How very different, I couldn't help thinking, from visiting a new building or part of a city I've not seen before and making my notes as I please in a cafe. </p> <p>The script of 102 Dalmatians, by the way, abounds in puns - most of them as funny as a dog sicking up over the new Axminster. How do they get away with this stuff? The dogs themselves and special effects are fun to watch, but then comes the mandatory love interest bit, which children hate and which made me want to get out my unfinished copy of Medicine and Magnificence: British Hospital and Asylum Architecture, 1660-1815, by Christine Stevenson, which I just happened to have in my bag. But it was too dark to read. </p> <p>In the affair on-screen, a silly chap with a Welsh accent (Ioan Gruffudd) plays man-as-misunderstood-yet-lovable-puppy who saves unloved dogs from beastly owners. He wears shorts for most of the film. Enough said. He falls for a Princess Diana lookalike (Alice Evans) who is a kind-hearted but efficient Anglo-American blonde probation officer, a nannyish breed that appears to put puppy boys' lives firmly on leads. I felt like scratching frantically on the Odeon doors at this point to go walkies. </p> <p>Anyway, they go on a first date to an Italian restaurant shipped in from the Central School of Catering by the look of the decor, and eat spaghetti with meatballs. Meanwhile, their dogs and the parrot who thinks he's a Rottweiler and blathers on in an annoying mockney accent (Whoops, it's the voice of Eric Idle - say no more) stay at home to gawp at Disney's The Lady and the Tramp on video. </p> <p>They watch the scene in which Lady and Tramp eat spaghetti with meatballs in the backyard of an Italian restaurant. So, people are dogs, too - geddit? Or dogs are people. Whichever, the trouble here is that the love scene between spaniel and mongrel in the enchanting cartoon is infinitely more touching than that between the goody-two-paws Welsh boy and Anglo-American Princess Diana lookalike in 102 Dalmatians. The dogs are good, though... </p> <p>Back outside the cinema, the real London comes thankfully back into focus, this mongrel city of second-rate skyscrapers, of Starbucks and McDonald's, where the buses are dented, the people are every colour under the rainclouds and no one says: \"Cor blimey, guv, half a mo', up the old apples and pears.\" </p> <p>Back to the day job with a bang, but with thoughts not so much of the film I've tried my best to review, but of the many more than 102 dogs, dalmatians or otherwise, that will be bought as Christmas presents - then dumped at pounds for what could be the rest of their spotty and all too real lives. </p> <p>\u0095 In the big shuffle tomorrow: TV critic Gareth McLean goes to the opera and dance critic Judith Mackrell visits a gallery.</p>",

Also, there were no children at the Odeon Leicester Square preview, just a pack of seen-it-all critics who would surely prefer to be reviewing some obscure out-of-focus Romanian masterpiece about a young woman tractor driver who falls in love with a reclusive existential poet who... or maybe Lassie Come Home. A thing of spots and patches, 102 Dalmatians does have some delicious moments. The denouement is gloriously messy: when the dogs, triumphing over the evil designs of Cruella De Vil and her camp couturier Jean Pierre Le Pelt ( jambonned into life a little too effortlessly by G\u00e9rard Depardieu) operate a Brobdingnagian baking machine that turns the dognapping villainess into a giant cake. A child's delight. Cruella steals the show, whether piloting her Panther De Ville limousine manically through Paris streets (Paris equals the Eiffel Tower, baguettes, poodles and Renault 4 taxis - Renault 4s? ) or staggering deliriously across Westminster Bridge and seeing the Houses of Parliament, Portcullis House and New Scotland Yard covered in spotted dalmatian fur. How she howls through her mansion, part Addams family house, part Sir John Soane's Museum (one for the architectural buffs). How she barks at a wavering Jean Pierre Le Pelt: \"Faint heart never won a fur lady.\" This line made me laugh, for the first time, an hour or so into the film. I began to write it down and then faced one of the difficulties of being a film critic: I couldn't see what my Biro was up to, and when I brought my notebook up to my eyes, I couldn't see the screen. How very different, I couldn't help thinking, from visiting a new building or part of a city I've not seen before and making my notes as I please in a cafe. The script of 102 Dalmatians, by the way, abounds in puns - most of them as funny as a dog sicking up over the new Axminster. How do they get away with this stuff? The dogs themselves and special effects are fun to watch, but then comes the mandatory love interest bit, which children hate and which made me want to get out my unfinished copy of Medicine and Magnificence: British Hospital and Asylum Architecture, 1660-1815, by Christine Stevenson, which I just happened to have in my bag. But it was too dark to read. In the affair on-screen, a silly chap with a Welsh accent (Ioan Gruffudd) plays man-as-misunderstood-yet-lovable-puppy who saves unloved dogs from beastly owners. He wears shorts for most of the film. Enough said. He falls for a Princess Diana lookalike (Alice Evans) who is a kind-hearted but efficient Anglo-American blonde probation officer, a nannyish breed that appears to put puppy boys' lives firmly on leads. I felt like scratching frantically on the Odeon doors at this point to go walkies. Anyway, they go on a first date to an Italian restaurant shipped in from the Central School of Catering by the look of the decor, and eat spaghetti with meatballs. Meanwhile, their dogs and the parrot who thinks he's a Rottweiler and blathers on in an annoying mockney accent (Whoops, it's the voice of Eric Idle - say no more) stay at home to gawp at Disney's The Lady and the Tramp on video. They watch the scene in which Lady and Tramp eat spaghetti with meatballs in the backyard of an Italian restaurant. So, people are dogs, too - geddit? Or dogs are people. Whichever, the trouble here is that the love scene between spaniel and mongrel in the enchanting cartoon is infinitely more touching than that between the goody-two-paws Welsh boy and Anglo-American Princess Diana lookalike in 102 Dalmatians. The dogs are good, though... Back outside the cinema, the real London comes thankfully back into focus, this mongrel city of second-rate skyscrapers, of Starbucks and McDonald's, where the buses are dented, the people are every colour under the rainclouds and no one says: \"Cor blimey, guv, half a mo', up the old apples and pears.\" Back to the day job with a bang, but with thoughts not so much of the film I've tried my best to review, but of the many more than 102 dogs, dalmatians or otherwise, that will be bought as Christmas presents - then dumped at pounds for what could be the rest of their spotty and all too real lives. \u0095 In the big shuffle tomorrow: TV critic Gareth McLean goes to the opera and dance critic Judith Mackrell visits a gallery.",

Stefanos Lazaridis's design has the performance space bounded by three whitewashed walls at the back and sides, which reminded me of the notorious leaflets about whitewashing your windows to \"ward off\" the heat flash of a nuclear blast. Certainly the grim faces of the Chorus seemed somehow ambiguous, as if absorbing some of God's anger, and defiantly returning it. </p> <p>But simply sitting there, in however striking a tableau, is obviously not an option for 90 minutes. So there is movement. The Chorus cower behind their chairs; they clutch each other, like a therapy group in hell; they rush to the back; they rush to the front; they rush to the middle. In one faintly Beckettian moment, they all put on blindfolds as if awaiting the divine firing squad. </p> <p>These are happy inventions, but I was less comfortable with the children, dressed brightly in contrast to the black-clad adults. There is an unhappy moment when the adults have to run about in panicky circles in infant school music-and-movement mode. But the overall effect is sturdy and sure-footed. </p> <p>It was beautifully sung, though I am not qualified to make further judgment, and there is something cinematic about Verdi's grandiloquence, and arguably something cinematic inherent in taking a choral piece and animating it so that it becomes in a sense its own soundtrack. </p> <p>As a big setpiece, Lloyd has a seven-ages-of-man sequence with a naked, pregnant woman coming on, followed by a baby, a child, and so on up to an old lady. That, combined with the coincidence of the date of the Verdi centenary, reminded me of the end of Kubrick's 2001, with successive visions of an ageing human self. </p> <p>The experience is actually a culture shock in different ways for the cinema critic. The way people move looks very earth-bound, compared with the hyper-real agility conferred by film on people in the most normal of situations. On screen, no one hesitates or missteps- at least not without some elaborately flagged reason. But on stage, there are a thousand infinitesimal uncertainties. </p> <p>The experience of watching opera renders superfluous the cinema critic's expertise in assessing the composition of a \"shot\". Often force of habit had me complaining for a fraction of a second: surely this set-up is wrong? A is sitting behind B and I can't see his facial expression. Can't we cut to a close-up of A's face, then to A's view of the back of B's head? Actually, another strange learned reflex for the critic comes into play in just looking, head-on, at the proscenium arch for an hour and a half. I kept thinking of it as the longest static wide shot imaginable. And, used to the manner of arthouse masters like Theo Angelopoulos, who seems to have only about a couple of dozens edits in each movie, the critic can hardly avoid thinking: \"Hmm, how interestingly severe - holding this shot for 90 minutes.\" </p> <p>Another culture shock for this cinema critic is that here I was forced to look at faces in a way subtly discouraged by the cinema. On screen, an important speaker is shown in close-up with crashing music if they are saying something important. Then they disappear from shot.

Anna Nolan's deal with the BBC digital channel comes as former Big Brother rival Melanie Hill nabs a presenting gig on a new reality TV show for Channel 4 digital entertainment channel E4. Ms Nolan, who won the hearts and minds of viewers with her cool approach to the traumatic weekly voting and backbiting among contestants, has had several offers of TV work, but says she has been waiting for the right opportunity. Ms Nolan told MediaGuardian.co.uk that she would be \"travelling around the world and talking to interesting and bizarre women\" in the six-part series. The interviewees, which will include a Thai prostitute and a New York aristocrat, will all be \"real women\" according to Ms Nolan. The high-profile series will be a boost to BBC Choice, which is being rebranded as BBC3, a youth channel that will compete with Sky One and the soon-to-launch Channel 4 digital channel E4. Stuart Murphy, head of BBC Choice, said that the programme was an \"interesting commission\" for the channel. He said: \"Anna keeps a lot back in the Big Brother house, and I'm delighted that viewers will be able to learn a lot more about her in this exciting series.\" The announcement follows the news that Melanie Hill, who notched up two romantic encounters with housemates while the series was on air, will front a reality show on E4.",

      "bodyText": "Hollywood film-makers are hoping that the world's fascination with the grisly fate of the Kursk will continue as they prepare to make a disaster movie about the sinking of a Russian nuclear submarine. Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson were in Moscow last week to research their leading roles in the film, but out of concern for the feelings of the relatives of 118 men who died in the Kursk in August, the film-makers have chosen to dramatise a 1961 incident which shocked the Soviet Union. In July that year the submarine K-19 - known affectionately as Hiroshima because of its history of radiation leaks - was left stranded in the middle of the Atlantic after an accident, cut off from all contact with the shore. A small group of heroic submariners exposed themselves to potentially fatal levels of radiation in an attempt to repair the vessel. Several died later from radiation poisoning. Another Soviet submarine mounted a dramatic mission to save the crew. The 1961 incident contains much of the horror and tension of the more recent disaster, with the added bonus - from the scriptwriters' point of view - that there are survivors who have been persuaded to help with the project. The film has been given the working title, K-19: Making Widows, according to a report in Komsomolskaya Pravda. Survivor agreed to cooperate only on the condition that the film's directors focused purely on the accident itself and the bravery of the Russian sailors rather than their private lives. Neeson and Ford spent several hours last week talking to veteran submariners and survivors of past accidents in an attempt to understand the sense of fear that grips a crew when catastrophe strikes. They also went to St Petersburg to explore a retired Russian submarine and received instructions on the workings of the vessel. At the Sailors and Submariners Club, the K-19's captain, Vladimir Vaganov, played in the film by Neeson, gave them a detailed description of life on board. A genuine Russian submarine - sold off as a tourist attraction in 1992 - has been obtained by the project's producers, and will be taken to Florida to be prepared for filming.",

      "trailText": "<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The government wants to improve the lot of both urban and rural dwellers, but, says <strong>Tony Travers</strong>, the countryside is always going to get the best part of the deal</p>",
      "byline": "Tony Travers",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Despite the fanfare when the urban white paper was launched, there was nothing for the cities in the Queen's speech. Could that be because, read back-to-back with last week's rural white paper, the two contradict each other? Between them, the government intends to make it less likely that people will quit metropolitan centres and more likely that those who live in rural areas will be happy. The two objectives do not add up. </p> <p>Here is the problem. For many years people have flooded away from older, larger towns and cities towards the safe beauty of the countryside. Once transport and telecommunications made it possible to enjoy the benefits of the city while living in the countryside, it is small wonder that millions fled the (often imagined) horrors of Manchester, Liverpool and the rest. </p> <p>The table shows how satisfied people are with their local area. It demonstrates the problem faced by the government: over three-quarters of people living in rural areas are \"very satisfied\", compared with just 35% in urban locations. The less urban an area is the more popular it will be. Only 3% of people in the most rural areas are in any way dissatisfied with their area compared with 14-16% in urban areas. </p> <p>The government said it wanted spending and tax breaks to increase the attractiveness of Britain's tatty cities. If more people could be persuaded to stay in them, developers would have less incentive to despoil what remains of England's green and pleasant land. John Prescott's department put together a respectable range of measures to make cities more financially and visually acceptable to their inhabitants. </p> <p>Now look at the rural white paper. This certainly painted a less bleak picture of the countryside than its urban counterpart did about the cities. Nevertheless, the rural document highlighted problems such as falling farm incomes, declining village services, development pressures and isolation. New initiatives, funding programmes and local government changes are proposed. For example, there will be more money for rural policing, extra resources for affordable housing in the countryside, dramatic improvements in rural bus services and more powers for parish councils. </p> <p>No one would oppose the proposed improvements to countryside services. For the poor, the non-car-owning and victims of crime in rural parts of the country there will always be a need for better public provision. The difficulty is that while problems in rural areas tend to centre on the poverty and difficulties of a minority of individuals, the white paper's solutions will have the effect of making the countryside as a whole even more attractive than it already is. </p> <p>Urban areas would, without public intervention, have major advantages over rural ones. The provision of new technology, for example, is already far more widespread in the cities than elsewhere. Other things being equal, the benefits of agglomeration (as economists are fond of calling them) point to significant advantages for large towns and cities. Yet governments of all parties feel the need to bring such urban advantages to the most rural of areas. Universal telephone and postal services are provided by way of cross-subsidies from towns and cities. </p> <p>The rural white paper makes clear how the government intervenes to bring the technological advantages of urban concentration to rural areas: \"the market alone will not deliver affordable high-speed connections to all rural areas. We will therefore work through the development agencies to develop effective strategies for the roll-out of higher bandwidth (new cable and/or wireless links) services in rural areas, taking full advantage of public sector investment\". </p> <p>Though the urban paper makes similar commit ments, in effect, people living in the countryside - likely to be better off anyway - are to be publicly subsidised to bring the advantages of urban life to their doorsteps. It is small wonder that people who can afford it flock away from the grime and poor services of (particularly) the older, northern cities. By moving to rural areas, they enjoy less stressed schools and hospitals, cleaner air and a chance of living somewhere with which they are really satisfied. Better still, governments of all parties will guarantee that universal service provision is subsidised so all the relative advantages of the cities are on tap. </p> <p>This is not to argue that people - particularly the vulnerable and children - who live in the countryside should be deprived of modern facilities and opportunities. But it is important to understand that society's kindly Fabian desire to ensure that no one, even in the most remote areas, should be denied a fuller set of public and private services than could be provided without subsidy is removing our cities' main advantage. </p> <p>So the government's urban and rural white papers will, between them, provide both urban and country areas with marginal new advantages.

      "bodyText": "Despite the fanfare when the urban white paper was launched, there was nothing for the cities in the Queen's speech. Could that be because, read back-to-back with last week's rural white paper, the two contradict each other? Between them, the government intends to make it less likely that people will quit metropolitan centres and more likely that those who live in rural areas will be happy. The two objectives do not add up. Here is the problem. For many years people have flooded away from older, larger towns and cities towards the safe beauty of the countryside. Once transport and telecommunications made it possible to enjoy the benefits of the city while living in the countryside, it is small wonder that millions fled the (often imagined) horrors of Manchester, Liverpool and the rest. The table shows how satisfied people are with their local area. It demonstrates the problem faced by the government: over three-quarters of people living in rural areas are \"very satisfied\", compared with just 35% in urban locations. The less urban an area is the more popular it will be. Only 3% of people in the most rural areas are in any way dissatisfied with their area compared with 14-16% in urban areas. The government said it wanted spending and tax breaks to increase the attractiveness of Britain's tatty cities. If more people could be persuaded to stay in them, developers would have less incentive to despoil what remains of England's green and pleasant land. John Prescott's department put together a respectable range of measures to make cities more financially and visually acceptable to their inhabitants. Now look at the rural white paper. This certainly painted a less bleak picture of the countryside than its urban counterpart did about the cities. Nevertheless, the rural document highlighted problems such as falling farm incomes, declining village services, development pressures and isolation. New initiatives, funding programmes and local government changes are proposed. For example, there will be more money for rural policing, extra resources for affordable housing in the countryside, dramatic improvements in rural bus services and more powers for parish councils. No one would oppose the proposed improvements to countryside services. For the poor, the non-car-owning and victims of crime in rural parts of the country there will always be a need for better public provision. The difficulty is that while problems in rural areas tend to centre on the poverty and difficulties of a minority of individuals, the white paper's solutions will have the effect of making the countryside as a whole even more attractive than it already is. Urban areas would, without public intervention, have major advantages over rural ones. The provision of new technology, for example, is already far more widespread in the cities than elsewhere. Other things being equal, the benefits of agglomeration (as economists are fond of calling them) point to significant advantages for large towns and cities. Yet governments of all parties feel the need to bring such urban advantages to the most rural of areas. Universal telephone and postal services are provided by way of cross-subsidies from towns and cities. The rural white paper makes clear how the government intervenes to bring the technological advantages of urban concentration to rural areas: \"the market alone will not deliver affordable high-speed connections to all rural areas. We will therefore work through the development agencies to develop effective strategies for the roll-out of higher bandwidth (new cable and/or wireless links) services in rural areas, taking full advantage of public sector investment\". Though the urban paper makes similar commit ments, in effect, people living in the countryside - likely to be better off anyway - are to be publicly subsidised to bring the advantages of urban life to their doorsteps. It is small wonder that people who can afford it flock away from the grime and poor services of (particularly) the older, northern cities. By moving to rural areas, they enjoy less stressed schools and hospitals, cleaner air and a chance of living somewhere with which they are really satisfied. Better still, governments of all parties will guarantee that universal service provision is subsidised so all the relative advantages of the cities are on tap. This is not to argue that people - particularly the vulnerable and children - who live in the countryside should be deprived of modern facilities and opportunities. But it is important to understand that society's kindly Fabian desire to ensure that no one, even in the most remote areas, should be denied a fuller set of public and private services than could be provided without subsidy is removing our cities' main advantage. So the government's urban and rural white papers will, between them, provide both urban and country areas with marginal new advantages. However, by giving the countryside new and better public services, there must be the risk that even more people will want to go and live there. It is easier to put on new bus services in country lanes than to remove dereliction and deprivation from inner-city housing estates. The paradox is that stopping the urban exodus would probably require less government action to make rural areas attractive. \u0095 Tony Travers is director of the Greater London group at the London School of Economics",

      "bodyText": "TV producer Action Time has come up with a big money, interactive game show format inspired by the stalemate in the US presidential election. In the Florida Trap contestants will be forced into knife-edge decisions over a potential \u00a31m prize fund. Just as in the US election, contestants can win the quiz show but ultimately lose the prize money because they have lost the public vote. Stephen Leahy, Action Time managing director, said: \"You can do everything possible to out-play and outwit your opponents and still end up a loser. Just when you think you've won, the votes are recounted.\" In a show in which participants compete with each other to answer quiz questions and complete brain teasers, they also have to face a viewers' vote on their behaviour. The Florida Trap mixes the big cash prize element of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? - offering a total cash prizes worth \u00a31m - with the competition and public participation featured in reality game shows such as Big Brother. Ten contestants start out with \u00a35,000 stake money each and can win money off their rivals by answering general knowledge questions in a studio-based quiz. But they can also team up to solve more complex puzzles requiring lateral thinking. At the end of each 60-minute show, contestants can make a plea to the audience, before \u00a3100,000 is distributed among the participants according to the percentage of votes each receives in a viewer poll. Then the contestant with the least money - when their balance and the cash received from the viewer vote is added together - is eliminated. Over the course of the series, \u00a31m in prize money will be at stake, and Mr Leahy said he reckoned the eventual winner could walk away with \u00a3300-400,000. \"The dilemma for contestants is that they must try and knock-out their opponents in the quiz, by winning their stake money and sending them into negative equity,\" he added. \"But this behaviour may not endear the quiz winners to viewers when it comes to the vote.\" Mr Leahy added that The Florida Trap would have a strong online element, with people being able to vote via the net, as well as by phone, and discuss different contestants' character and chances of winning on chatrooms. He is talking to a number of UK broadcasters about the format and will also be pitching it to several US networks at the Natpe programming market next month. The Florida Trap has already been optioned by broadcasters in Israel, Greece and Italy. Action Time has worldwide rights to the new format, with talent agency CAA's Michael Comachao handling the US negotiations. The indie, which is owned by Carlton Communications, is also producing upcoming Channel 5 psycho game show The Mole and distributing another, Survivor, around the world.",

They gave only excuses. Like, how will she get into school? How will she do the entrance test? </p> <p>\"I told them someone could read it to her, or photocopy it blown up very big. The teacher said they hadn't got the facilities for that. Another teacher came over and said: 'How will she play netball?'\" Lauren pipes in, \"What was really annoying was the school's motto, 'Makers of the past. Makers of the present. Makers of the future'. I'm a maker of the future!\" </p> <p>Lauren, now 14, is severely visually impaired. Until the age of 11, she travelled to a specialist school for the blind. But Lauren and her mother wanted her to attend a local mainstream secondary school. </p> <p>Since October last year, a cinema, restaurant, shop or leisure centre cannot reasonably refuse their services to Lauren, but a school can. Currently there is little to prevent a school excluding a child on the grounds that they couldn't cater for their disability. Educational establishments were specifically excluded from part 3 of the Disability Discrimination Act. </p> <p>But the new SEN (special educational needs) and disability rights in education bill, published last week, is designed to redress this exemption. For the first time, schools will be obliged to plan for the inclusion of all children. The presumption is that children with statements of special educational needs will be educated in mainstream. At last the excuses Lauren faced will no longer count as valid reasons to keep her from being educated with her peers. </p> <p>The bill has been warmly welcomed by the disability lobby, teachers unions, the voluntary sector, and families with children with disabilities. But there's concern that some children may still face unnecessary hurdles. A controversial caveat in the bill states that a child with SEN shall be educated within mainstream provision unless it prejudices \"the provision of efficient education for other children\". It will be a continual point of debate. It could be challenged at the bill's committee stage early next year. </p> <p>This caveat has been described as a cop-out clause, as nimbyism in the classroom. It's fine in principle to include all children - a laudable aim - but in practice when a child with a disability applies to go to a particular school, perhaps your school, only then do the objections arise from the local education authority, the teachers and other families. </p> <p>Lauren is now happily in the third year of her mainstream secondary school, Waverley, in south-east London. \"With Waverley it was different,\" says Julie Roberts. \"They had such a positive attitude from the start.\" </p> <p>Inclusion can be a long, slow process. Initially, Lauren attended only two days a week, building slowly up to full-time. The physical environment was unfamiliar to her; dinner and break times were spent sitting in the specialist learning centre, where she ate her packed lunch. Now she has school dinners and is in the playground with her friends. She has a support assistant and teaching support, in case she needs something copied down off the board or the content of a video to be described. The school provides very wide-lined paper for her to write on. </p> <p>She proudly shows me her work, with projects on plant cells and soil erosion in Nepal. Pages from textbooks are photocopied on to large A3 sheets so she can read them close-up. She is allowed to keep all her work in one big ring folder with dividers, so she doesn't have to differentiate between subject books. \"The only class I don't join in is metalwork, because of the machinery,\" says Lauren. \"I do try sport, but in football I can't see the ball. Netball is better.\" </p> <p>Disability is not a single condition, but covers a wide spectrum of needs. Stuart Hayter is head of an inner London primary school that prides itself on being inclusive. Alfred Salter is a newly built, fully accessible school, resourced for the hearing impaired, with 31 children with statements of educational needs on a school register of around 400. Hayter has been seconded by the local education authority to persuade other schools in the borough to become resourced for specific disabilities. </p> <p>\"The ones you can never persuade schools to take on are children with emotional and behavioural difficulties,\" he says. \"They don't want to be a magnet for difficult children. To be fair, it's something even we would think twice about.\" But Hayter believes that the inclusion of even the most disruptive children is possible. \"The whole staff has to be motivated to make it work. Staff should be trained to de-personalise themselves from any incident, and be able to deal with it.\" He adds, \"You need a lot of training.\" </p> <p>However good the intention of the new bill, the burden of inclusion inevitably falls on those with little knowledge of special needs. Seventy per cent of teachers will teach a child with autism; only 5% have had autism-specific training. \"TheDisability Discrimination Act had training that went with it for people who ran businesses,\" says Lindsay Brewis, Scope's education adviser.</p> <p>\"This new bill has no staff training that goes along with it. There's nothing to help schools in how they might implement it, so schools are trying as they go along, and make mistakes. It's these mistakes that get the publicity. They create a wariness of taking children with disabilities.\" </p> <p>Lauren's form tutor says it was a \"matter of chance\" that expertise was available. By coincidence, someone from Lauren's former school started working at Waverley, and could give them advice. Of course, training costs money, and there is as yet no financial package to accompany the new bill. </p> <p>But money has been made available to make schools more accessible. Government funding for the Schools Access Initiative has been doubled to \u00a3220m over the next three years. But Lindsay Brewis still worries where this money is going to be spent. </p> <p>\"The Schools Access Initiative budget is often used for new schools, which would have to be accessible anyway, rather than making what already exists accessible,\" she says. \"And there's often a very narrow view of what accessibility means. It's not just ramps and handrails. It's the acoustic environment, communications aids, assistive technology, or a cooling-off suite for EBD [emotional and behavioural difficulties] where children could go and thrash about a bit.\" </p> <p>A little investment can go a long way towards inclusion. Wide-lined paper made all the difference to Lauren. Classroom teacher Sarah Beckwith, who admits she has \"never had any training in SEN, just talked to past teachers\", has an 11-year-old girl with cerebral palsy in her year 5 class at Lawley primary school in Telford. </p> <p>\"This year she's been given a computer with programmes that use phrases, so she doesn't have to key in every letter,\" says Beckwith. \"Before, she was getting frustrated because she knew more than she was able to write down. She can join in the group work more, and others can use the computer for shared work. Now she's showing her capabilities.\" </p> <p>With the emphasis on league tables, the concern of schools is often that children with special needs will adversely affect their results. \"You've got mixed messages from government,\" says Stuart Hayter. \"Standards, standards, standards - yet inclusion. They should put results into context far more. When you present league tables or other performance indicators, you can say there are 31 statemented children, but you can't say the nature of their difficulties. A bright child with physical disability is not the same as a child with severe learning difficulties. The simple numbers don't explain the impact. But sometimes people worry too much about Sats results. You have to be a bit more broad-shouldered.\" </p> <p>Jan Nicolas, chief executive of Parents for Inclusion, argues that inclusion can increase your league table status. \"By including a wider range of children whose potential to date may not have been recognised, the overall achievement of the school may benefit,\" she says. A National Autistic Society report, Inclusion. Is it Working?, found that the more able children were more likely to be excluded - 29% compared to 21%. More able children are less likely to receive the support they need, as their disability is not so obvious. And because they don't receive the support, including them can be more difficult. </p> <p> To some families, there appears to be an impossible burden on children with special needs. John King's 10-year-old son Thomas, who has cerebral palsy, is in the final year of mainstream primary school. He applied to mainstream secondary, but the local education authority has raised objections; in a recent amended statement they said Thomas \"can distract others\", a potential reason for exclusion under the \"prejudicial to other children\" caveat. \"He's pushed over a pencil pot a couple of times!\" says King. \"As soon as you have a child with SEN they take things any other child would do and turn it into a problem.\" </p> <p>Lindsay Brewis sees the caveat as putting the onus on children with SEN to behave better than the general population. \"The caveat is there for all children already. Any child that prejudices the development and learning of the rest of the school can be excluded or not admitted. Do we need to have it restated for children with SEN? It has been used to exclude those who are just difficult to accommodate, rather than those who are genuinely prejudicial to the education of other children.\" </p> <p>Many schools have found that including those with SEN enhances the school life of the other children, rather than prejudicing it. Anne Parrish's eight-year-old, who is not disabled, goes to Alfred Salter Primary School. Anne had not come across children with disabilities until her daughter went to the school nursery. \"I think it's really good that disabled children join a school from the very start. Then the other kids just see them as part of the class. If they come later on, or at secondary school, you and they wonder 'What's that?' They realise early on what a child with a disability can do. You shouldn't judge a book by it's cover.\" </p> <p>\"It's made them more understanding,\" says Lauren's form tutor. \"I'm not saying they're angels - because they're not. But there's more of a community spirit about. It's developed a caring side of their nature that we don't always get to see.\" </p> <p>John King has gathered together letters from the children in Thomas's class, supporting his son's application for a mainstream secondary place. \"I'm in Thomas's class and it is, to me, the luckiest class in the school,\" wrote one girl. \"He needs extra help in some things, but that doesn't mean he's different. He wants to go to your school because he likes it. I'd like to be in the same class as him if you let him in. He always joins in our games, comes to assembly. So please let him in.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "A powerful consumers' panel is to be placed at the centre of a proposed giant single media regulator covering television, radio, advertising, the internet, telephones and the press. The new regulator, dubbed Ofcom, will be outlined in today's communications white paper as the government's main response to the blurring of boundaries between media technologies. The independently appointed consumers' panel will have powers to commission research, canvass public opinion and publish advice to the regulator, as well as its views on issues of taste, programme content and quality. It will also advise Ofcom on its regulatory powers, including decisions on media ownership rules. The panel could for instance argue against Rupert Murdoch being allowed to extend his media empire into terrestial television. The government accepts that economic regulation decisions directly affect consumer concerns such as price, choice, and programme content. Some ministers privately hope the panel may also act as a powerful popular restraint on media magnates, allowing government to step back from the front line of the battle to control media quality. A government source said the move would put consumers \"at the heart of regulation\". He added: \"This is a world where some of the most powerful companies in the world operate and lobby bloody hard.\" The source added that the consumers' panel could also consult through citizens' juries and the internet. The white paper will also strip the BBC board of governors of some of its self-regulatory powers, but leave the board as chief defenders of the BBC's political impartiality. The white paper, prepared jointly by the departments of culture and industry, is intended to liberalise the regulatory regime whilst protecting programme quality. Ministerial sources also promise the white paper will ensure that as digital television takes over consumers retain free access to many programmes. The new giant regulator will take over the roles of the broadcasting standards council, the independent television commission, the radio authority, the British board of film classification, Oftel and the advertising standards authority. A government source said: \"We have to recognise we now live in a world in which you can watch TV on your mobile phone, or listen to music on the internet. \"Technology is bringing the media together and to continue to have separate regulators is mad.\"",

He said the City watchdog would reflect on what lessons could be learned, and that its new approach to regulating financial services companies meant \"this kind of thing would be handled in a different kind of way in the future\". Mr Davies was speaking three days after the company closed to new business and warned existing policyholders they could expect lower investment returns after it failed to attract a buyer. These moves, plus its decision to impose a 10% penalty on any with-profits pension customer wanting to switch from the company, left many of Equitable's 650,000 policyholders worried and confused. The company said yesterday it had received thousands of calls to its helpline but it was too early to say how many people intended to move their money. It will write to policyholders in the next few days . Equitable put itself up for sale after losing a legal battle involving guarantees given to some policyholders. Some commentators have said the FSA should have taken action earlier and criticised the decision to allow Equitable Life to continue selling policies until late last week, even after reports that the potential bill faced by the insurer to meet the guarantees might be much higher than originally thought.

Tony Blair said we couldn't go on doing business like this.</p> <p>Yet nothing is simple in Washington either. Winner-take-all politics is supposed to produce clear winners, a choice of one or the other. But the US, we learn, has no process for dealing with a dead-even split in the electorate. The EU, by exact and equal contrast, is not designed to produce a neat divide. One system speaks to simplicity, the other to complexity, yet each can produce its own version of sweaty deadlock.</p> <p>The lesson is especially sharp for the British. Steeped for centuries in winner-take-all juices, the British find it hard to absorb confessions of compromise from their leaders. They like the clarity of black and white. That's the way all EU summits are reported, both by the politicians and by the media. National victory and/or defeat seems to be the only basis on which most Brits can understand events. So that's the way Mr Blair and Mr Cook presented Nice.</p> <p>They talked of victory partly because the tabloid agenda demands tabloid responses - though Mr Cook went a little far when he claimed that Britain had \"more votes\" than ever before, as if this was some marvellous competitive triumph instead of the natural result of general uprating. But they also talked victory because it is, in their terms, true. Even the Sun was prepared to say so. On defence, contrary to Saturday's malign reporting in several papers, the rapid reaction force meets Anglo-American needs. More broadly, the veto agenda set out beforehand was well satisfied. For once, this wasn't a summit contest ranging Britain versus the rest.</p> <p>On the other hand, it wasn't black and white. For the future of Europe, Nice sent out mixed signals. It was indeed a compromise, partly integrationist and partly the opposite. The short-term requirements of governments produced results that cut both ways for the EU, and may have permanent effects.</p> <p>On one side of the checklist, for example, sits tax reform. The exemption of all tax change from qualified majority voting (QMV) will have dire consequences as well as good ones. Not only direct tax rates but every tax initiative for other purposes will need unanimity. By insisting on this, Britain excluded, perhaps indefinitely, the possibility of eco-taxes under the EU's aegis: a crude veto that destroys any claim this country has to environmental sensitivity. Disintegrationism flourishes, even in a field where uniformity would make sense.</p> <p>The other side of the reckoning, though, foreshadows shifts the other way, towards more integration. Changes in national weights of vote show that. Germany made a heroic sacrifice, unimaginable from France or Britain, in not insisting on the highest weight, to reflect its 20m extra population. But the total vote of the six founder members of the community will be 117, up from 48% to 51%. They usually agree. With Spain, Austria and Portugal alongside, they will push their line.</p> <p>The Brit-Scandinavian bloc, by contrast, is weaker. Though the three largest countries will have blocking power, this historico-regional dividing line matters more in the real world than smalls versus bigs, the issue that brought Nice closest to breakdown.</p> <p>The integrationist thrust, in other words, has not expired. Out of the murk of trade-offs and compromise, the twin impulses of enlargement and integration emerge as complementary. The very rigour of the Nice negotiation, because it concluded with a treaty, shows a process that still has momentum.</p> <p>It is not clean, and it's far from easy. Its imperfections can be instantly listed. The leaders emerged exhausted after an exercise in coalitionism that is alien to the Anglo-American political tradition. But it was neither the fiasco nor the disaster which that tradition deemed proper to report before the end was reached. Those words will soon look more appropriate to the election result legitimised by the US supreme court.</p> <p>Reporting to the Commons yesterday, Mr Blair plunged deeper into the language of Europeanism than he has before. After chalking up his national victories, he started to offer lessons in the bigger picture. They were about enlargement, about making the EU work better, about the naked self-interest in extending some aspects of QMV. He even dared to say he'd tried to get QMV brought in faster for certain trade issues.</p> <p>Presenting himself as the acme of common sense, he carried the pro-Europe argument to the enemy on the other side with more relish than I've ever seen, discovering new wells of ridicule to expose the Conservative line on Europe for what it is: petty, narrow, anachronistic, contradictory, dishonest and protected by the impenitent ignorance that derives from blazing doctrinal anger.</p> <p>Another stage of the journey into continental complexity now begins. Mr Blair did not ask for a new intergovernmental conference to be fixed, with a 2004 deadline. He didn't want it before the first wave of new members are admitted. Originally the British also opposed the framing of a charter of rights, let alone its implementation into law.</p> <p>On both points, Mr Blair quietly acquiesced before Nice. It's almost certain that the charter, now registered as a declaration in the treaty, will be pushed towards more formal status at the next IGC, which is one reason why Britain wanted to slow-time both developments.</p> <p>The temptation will be to enter the 2004 process in wholly defensive mode. That would be the usual British way. It was how Margaret Thatcher and John Major viewed every IGC they failed to prevent, and also, to begin with, how the Blair government regarded aspects of what loomed at Nice.</p> <p>The Foreign Office is leery of these developments. It knows how dangerous it is to start unpicking and simplifying treaties, which is set out as one of the 2004 tasks: a sensible thing to be doing, in response to the ever-deepening incomprehensibility of everything to do with the EU, but a tricky one all the same.</p> <p>Mr Blair may be less defensive. With an election victory under his belt, he should be. There were signs at and after Nice that he might be. He has, after all, won quite a lot already, especially in influencing the economic trajectory of the EU. He has also won some big arguments, notably over the British budget contribution, and defence. The euro presents his biggest decision before 2004. If he ducks it, his influence will soon wane.</p> <p>But an IGC, led by Germany, to establish the borderlines between the EU and national governments in this federation of nation states is an opportunity not a threat. It presents formidable complexities, in the continental style. But we are not living in the American system. Fortunately, some might say.

      "body": "<p>London Underground is becoming less safe and more secretive as it moves falteringly towards the private/ public partnership that John Prescott intends unleashing on the travelling public before the next election. </p> <p>Although under scrutiny from the health and safety executive, LU refuses to discuss breakdown figures or give details of performance which it is legally obliged to provide. It hides behind the excuse that the recent woeful record of breakdowns on the Central and Jubilee lines is not a matter \"for public debate\". It claims performance records \"contain commercially sensitive information\". </p> <p>With reluctance, it admits that trains have been performing badly. That is an understatement. Official LU figures show that, while Central and Jubilee line trains should run for at least 25,000km (15,500 miles) before failing, in October last year they were able to achieve only about 4,500 km before breakdown occurred. </p> <p>When asked for more recent information, LU refused, saying it did not \"intend to enter a public debate\". It did say it experienced teething difficulties with the opening of the Jubilee line extension last year, since largely resolved. </p> <p>Tell that to its passengers who daily make more than 2.6m journeys on the Tube, nearly as many as the entire national rail network. Demand has reached record levels and continues to grow as people in the capital try to escape congestion in the streets above. </p> <p>The increasing fragility of an overcrowded system and the health and safety executive's growing exasperation with LU have exposed examples of management failure. </p> <p>Some 2,000 people were trapped for two hours in the rush hour on two Central line trains recently, stuck behind another which had broken down at Liverpool Street station. It had blown a fuse and a replacement was not immediately available. Staff tried unsuccessfully to shunt the crippled train out of the station. The fire brigade was not summoned quickly, and the angry, frustrated and frightened passengers were eventually escorted out along the tunnel. </p> <p>Under LU's undertaking, following the King's Cross fire 11 years ago, they should have been evacuated within half an hour. </p> <p>The HSE is unhappy that LU was slow to get the passengers out. It, too, has found problems getting accurate information from management and says there is a \"serious\" risk that it will have to prosecute LU. Hardly a day goes by without incidents on the Tube, from signalling failures to escalator breakdowns and train cancellations. They have become so common, and the public so inured to them, that the media have reduced coverage of the scandal. </p> <p>But safety, as the Paddington rail crash has demonstrated, is an issue. That is heightened on the Tube by the HSE's insistence that it will not accept any plans for public/private partnership unless it is \"completely happy\" with the safety case. This may be a belated move to protect itself from criticism of the railways inspectorate's failure to act in events leading up to the Paddington crash. </p> <p>The HSE also plans to produce a report on the government's plan to part-privatise the system, which could sound the death-knell for the project. </p> <p>Billions of pounds of new investment is required to reverse the Tube's rundown state and make it an efficient system. For Ken Livingstone, London's mayor, that is essential. The capital's streets are clogged by road works and cable laying, carried out haphazardly. The impact on public transport above the ground has been alarming. </p> <p>Much of Mr Livingstone's electoral success is down to a promise that he would solve London's transport problems, with the introduction of congestion charging at the heart of his strategy. </p> <p>However, that project has been beset by objections to the level of charges and demands from \"essential workers\" for exemption. That makes a safe, reliable Tube system all the more important if London is to keep moving. </p> <p> Keith Harper is the Guardian's transport editor</p>",

Although under scrutiny from the health and safety executive, LU refuses to discuss breakdown figures or give details of performance which it is legally obliged to provide. It hides behind the excuse that the recent woeful record of breakdowns on the Central and Jubilee lines is not a matter \"for public debate\". It claims performance records \"contain commercially sensitive information\". With reluctance, it admits that trains have been performing badly. That is an understatement. Official LU figures show that, while Central and Jubilee line trains should run for at least 25,000km (15,500 miles) before failing, in October last year they were able to achieve only about 4,500 km before breakdown occurred. When asked for more recent information, LU refused, saying it did not \"intend to enter a public debate\". It did say it experienced teething difficulties with the opening of the Jubilee line extension last year, since largely resolved. Tell that to its passengers who daily make more than 2.6m journeys on the Tube, nearly as many as the entire national rail network. Demand has reached record levels and continues to grow as people in the capital try to escape congestion in the streets above. The increasing fragility of an overcrowded system and the health and safety executive's growing exasperation with LU have exposed examples of management failure. Some 2,000 people were trapped for two hours in the rush hour on two Central line trains recently, stuck behind another which had broken down at Liverpool Street station. It had blown a fuse and a replacement was not immediately available. Staff tried unsuccessfully to shunt the crippled train out of the station. The fire brigade was not summoned quickly, and the angry, frustrated and frightened passengers were eventually escorted out along the tunnel. Under LU's undertaking, following the King's Cross fire 11 years ago, they should have been evacuated within half an hour. The HSE is unhappy that LU was slow to get the passengers out. It, too, has found problems getting accurate information from management and says there is a \"serious\" risk that it will have to prosecute LU. Hardly a day goes by without incidents on the Tube, from signalling failures to escalator breakdowns and train cancellations. They have become so common, and the public so inured to them, that the media have reduced coverage of the scandal. But safety, as the Paddington rail crash has demonstrated, is an issue. That is heightened on the Tube by the HSE's insistence that it will not accept any plans for public/private partnership unless it is \"completely happy\" with the safety case. This may be a belated move to protect itself from criticism of the railways inspectorate's failure to act in events leading up to the Paddington crash. The HSE also plans to produce a report on the government's plan to part-privatise the system, which could sound the death-knell for the project. Billions of pounds of new investment is required to reverse the Tube's rundown state and make it an efficient system. For Ken Livingstone, London's mayor, that is essential. The capital's streets are clogged by road works and cable laying, carried out haphazardly. The impact on public transport above the ground has been alarming. Much of Mr Livingstone's electoral success is down to a promise that he would solve London's transport problems, with the introduction of congestion charging at the heart of his strategy. However, that project has been beset by objections to the level of charges and demands from \"essential workers\" for exemption. That makes a safe, reliable Tube system all the more important if London is to keep moving. Keith Harper is the Guardian's transport editor",

Mr Weir admitted that the company was still labouring in the shadow of marimastat and its follow-up drug BB-3644, which few analysts expect to work. Final data from clinical trials is due in the first quarter. Mr Weir said: \"A resolution of that frees us up to look at a lot more issues.\"",

Mr Mitchell, who heads a five-member fact-finding mission, met the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, for three hours before going to Gaza last night to meet the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat. The team is to travel to Egypt and Jordan. But their mission was eclipsed by the domestic political turmoil of the first machinations in Israel's election campaign.

Officials said that a deal to swap the soldiers for 19 Lebanese prisoners in Israeli jails could be reached in as little as 10 days. Mr Mitchell said: \"We have no illusions about the difficult nature of the task ahead.

Local people said he had been cut down in cold blood when he stepped outside his shop; the Israeli army said he was a known Islamist militant who had opened fire on one of its posts. The two versions underscores the huge difficulties in establishing the facts of the last 10 weeks, in which 261 Palestinians, 38 Jews and Israeli soldiers, and 13 Arab citizens of Israel have been killed. The Palestinians accuse Israeli soldiers of using excessive force, and firing on unarmed civilians. Nearly a quarter of the dead were under 18. The army is adamant that its troops fire only in self-defence, or to protect Israeli civilians. The truth has become even harder to establish in recent weeks, as the insurrection in the West Bank and Gaza which began with teenagers throwing stones has developed into an increasingly savage low-intensity conflict. Israeli tanks and combat helicopters have bombarded Palestinian cities in reprisal for militia gunfire, Israeli hit squads have assassinated militants from Mr Arafat's Fatah organisation, and Palestinian gunmen in cars have ambushed cars driven by Jewish settlers. The investigation into the causes of the violence emerged early on as one of the most contentious issues between Israel and the Palestinians. The Palestinians lobbied hard for a full-scale international investigation, hoping to haul Israel before a war crimes tribunal. Having been condemned by the UN security council and human rights organisations for excessive force, that was Israel's greatest fear. Even after agreeing to the mission in mid-October, the Israeli government strenuously resisted Mr Mitchell's visit this week, urging the team to wait until the violence had ended. In the end, Israel folded. But the mission has only the most modest ambitions.

Scots Guardsmen James Fisher and Mark Wright were convicted five years ago of murder for shooting Peter McBride in the back in north Belfast in 1992. Last month, the MoD decided they should be allowed to stay in the army, even though it admitted they had lied at their trial. The decision was widely condemned, not least by Northern Ireland's independent assessor for military complaints. It was taken by the army board, whose members included John Spellar, minister for the armed forces. The board referred to \"exceptional circumstances\" surrounding the case. Last month, Lewis Moonie, the junior defence minister, told the Labour MP Kevin McNamara that the board's report was a \"confidential matter for the employer, the army, and the employees.\" However, the ministry has sent a detailed report to Jean McBride, Peter's mother, giving its reasons for an \"unprecedented\" decision. The board's classified report has been passed to the Guardian by the Pat Finucane Centre, a Derry-based civil rights group. \"Both Guardsmen were young and relatively inexperienced when the incident took place on 4 September 1992\", it says. Guardsman Fisher was born in 1968 and Guardsman Wright in 1973, says the report. \"This was their first tour of duty in Northern Ireland and they and only been there for four months\". It describes the \"general security situation\" at the time as \"tense and particularly so in the New Lodge area where the unit had suffered recent casualties including a fatality\". The soldiers had been briefed to expect \"that those associated with terrorist groups would be likely to be carrying personal weapons\". The report adds: \"Furthermore, the threat of coffee-jar bombs at the time of the offences was very real: soldiers had been maimed and, on occasion, killed by this weapon. The coffee-jar bomb was a device which was very easy to conceal until the moment of throwing\". The board says there was no evidence of \"individual or collective premeditation to commit a criminal offence\"; that the army \"could not prepare an individual for every eventuality\"; that the guardsmen had expressed \"regret\" for Peter McBride's death, and that neither guardsman had any previous criminal record. The board says the two soldiers had been \"utterly loyal\" to the army and their present commanding officer had spoken \"very highly\" of them, not least regarding the part they had played in operations in Macedonia and Kosovo in 1999. For these reasons, the board says, the two soldiers should be allowed to remain in the army despite the trial judge's finding that they knew Mr McBride posed no threat, were not \"in any panic situation\", and \"deliberately chose to put forward a version which they both knew to be untrue\". The Belfast high court last week gave Mrs McBride leave to appeal against the board's decision. The Guardian last week revealed that soldiers from the Scots Guards had sent a Christmas card to the Pat Finucane Centre.

She describes how she met her daughter's husband-to-be, Jimmy Gulzar, and was unimpressed. </p> <p>\"I says 'Jim, I think that you're marrying Melanie for her money and I think you're gay',\" she recalls. But to mouthy Mel, parental disapproval of Jimmy, allied with the collective doubts of the other Spice Girls, was like a dare. It made her even more determined to marry Gulzar, with predictable tabloid-teasing consequences. </p> <p>Judging by this TV portrait, they should have called her Noisy Spice instead of Scary Spice. Whether she's at home in Leeds with her family, potty-training baby Phoenix, or riding round in the back of her limo between visits to her divorce lawyer, Ms B simply can't shut up. Lob any subject at her - her childhood showbiz ambitions, the boob job she insists she hasn't had, or her spectacular country house in Marlow, Bucks - and she rants mild- mannered interviewer Trevor Nelson to a standstill. Even when she goes for a pee she has to have somebody to talk to... or at. Her lovely home has a lavatory with two loos in it, because, according to Mel, \"girls always go to the loo together\". </p> <p>You'll have seen worse celebrity portraits than this - that shocking piece of drivel about Geri Halliwell and her international \"good works\", for instance - but no Spice Girl would ever allow TV cameras across her doorstep unless she had some product to plug. In this case, the interviewee has two dollops of money- spinning Yuletide candyfloss on sale, the Spice Girls album and her own solo effort, the lukewarm Hot. The film boosts Mel's image of \"feisty northern lass\", but makes it impossible to believe she has experienced a moment of serious thought in her life. </p>",

But to mouthy Mel, parental disapproval of Jimmy, allied with the collective doubts of the other Spice Girls, was like a dare. It made her even more determined to marry Gulzar, with predictable tabloid-teasing consequences. Judging by this TV portrait, they should have called her Noisy Spice instead of Scary Spice. Whether she's at home in Leeds with her family, potty-training baby Phoenix, or riding round in the back of her limo between visits to her divorce lawyer, Ms B simply can't shut up. Lob any subject at her - her childhood showbiz ambitions, the boob job she insists she hasn't had, or her spectacular country house in Marlow, Bucks - and she rants mild- mannered interviewer Trevor Nelson to a standstill. Even when she goes for a pee she has to have somebody to talk to... or at. Her lovely home has a lavatory with two loos in it, because, according to Mel, \"girls always go to the loo together\". You'll have seen worse celebrity portraits than this - that shocking piece of drivel about Geri Halliwell and her international \"good works\", for instance - but no Spice Girl would ever allow TV cameras across her doorstep unless she had some product to plug. In this case, the interviewee has two dollops of money- spinning Yuletide candyfloss on sale, the Spice Girls album and her own solo effort, the lukewarm Hot. The film boosts Mel's image of \"feisty northern lass\", but makes it impossible to believe she has experienced a moment of serious thought in her life.",

Failing to find 150 inflated goats readily to hand but sunnily confident of success (\"I've done the sums!\"), he improvised with a bridge of bright, sausage-shaped balloons.

When they call time on t'Rovers, they call time on an 'ole generation.\" The Rovers has been threatened with a name change before. Ten years ago Newton and Ridley planned to turn it into a theme pub called Yankees until Bet and Alec, the licensees, manned the barricades and defied them. Pub names are something to be puzzled over and treasured. The Case Is Altered, The King Of Poland, The Goat And Compasses, The Sun In Splendour, The Old Blue Last and The Litten Tree. All of them with a tap root deep in history and branches lost in mysterious mist. Why is the old last blue and what is a litten tree? In fact customers call pubs what they want to call them. Only my mother called our pub the Mill Hill Hotel, giving each unaccustomed aitch a firm tap on the head like a boiled egg. Everyone else called it t'New Pub.

A secluded gully called Mait's Rest (the spot where Maitland Bryan, the area's first Forestry Officer, used to rest his horse) is one of the few remaining pockets of native rainforest. The steep, rugged terrain and the thickness of vegetation preserved the Otway area from European settlement until the middle of the 19th century, when Europeans cleared parts for farming.</p> <p>When gold was found at Ballarat and Bendigo, commercial logging began, to support the mining industry and the growth of Melbourne. In 1870 a tramway was built to transport timber. Through the 1880s sawmills proliferated; there were no controls. Now, there are state controls, but many think them inadequate. A felling programme which will affect the headwaters of the most spectacular of the Otway's many waterfalls (it falls 130 metres down through virgin forest) is currently pitting the bushwalking, tourism and conservation interests against the timber industry.</p> <p>Our walk through Mait's Rest when, in the fine rain and cool breeze, the leaves glistened and trembled, took us deep into a still, mysterious enclosed space, with mosses, lichens, luxuriant giant ferns, vines and fungi, down below the lofty canopy that shades them all. Some ancient gum-trees (the kind called mountain ash) tower into the sky, mutilated survivors of fire and felling, their tops sheered off so that far below, on the soft forest floor, great mossy logs are slowly rotting, making their contribution to the forest's slow life-cycle.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The hills of the Otway Range climb steeply up behind the rocky, shipwreck coast of the State of Victoria. A secluded gully called Mait's Rest (the spot where Maitland Bryan, the area's first Forestry Officer, used to rest his horse) is one of the few remaining pockets of native rainforest. The steep, rugged terrain and the thickness of vegetation preserved the Otway area from European settlement until the middle of the 19th century, when Europeans cleared parts for farming. When gold was found at Ballarat and Bendigo, commercial logging began, to support the mining industry and the growth of Melbourne. In 1870 a tramway was built to transport timber. Through the 1880s sawmills proliferated; there were no controls. Now, there are state controls, but many think them inadequate. A felling programme which will affect the headwaters of the most spectacular of the Otway's many waterfalls (it falls 130 metres down through virgin forest) is currently pitting the bushwalking, tourism and conservation interests against the timber industry. Our walk through Mait's Rest when, in the fine rain and cool breeze, the leaves glistened and trembled, took us deep into a still, mysterious enclosed space, with mosses, lichens, luxuriant giant ferns, vines and fungi, down below the lofty canopy that shades them all. Some ancient gum-trees (the kind called mountain ash) tower into the sky, mutilated survivors of fire and felling, their tops sheered off so that far below, on the soft forest floor, great mossy logs are slowly rotting, making their contribution to the forest's slow life-cycle.",

      "bodyText": "Hey, sad loser! Who are you calling a sad loser? Oops, forgive me. For a moment I got you confused with the delectable Victoria Beckham. Goodness, what has poor old Mrs Megabucks done to arouse such ire? I thought her single was rather decent. And don't forget she's married to Mr Megabucks, the Manchester United footballer David Beckham, who's just released an autobiography and video in time for Christmas. But it's not me calling her a sad loser, it's the 480,000 readers of Smash Hits. They voted her second saddest loser of the year in their annual poll. Well, at least she wasn't first, which went to Liam Gallagher of the once-great Oasis. And besides, when you're as famous and talented as Posh, you have to expect the odd bit of jealousy here and there. I suppose that would explain why the Spice Girls came first in the worst group, worst album, worst single and worst video categories, not to mention Mel C storming ahead of the Steps lads to scoop most tragic hair cut. Consistent, if nothing else - and don't forget second worst-dressed. How cruel, coming just weeks after their new album, Forever, spectacularly failed to live up to the hype, dropping out of the top 10 after just one week and selling one-third of that of their Irish arch-rivals, Westlife. The mighty colossus that was once girl power seems to be on the wane, maybe because they took three years off after the last album to pursue solo careers, revealing themselves in the process as ruthless businesswomen who cared more about Gucci than female empowerment. I say, that's a bit harsh. And les Girls have always had a way of bouncing back from adversity, so it might be too early to be announcing their downfall. I refer you to Mel C's recent \"jokey\" comment to Frank Skinner on his ITV chat show about having already left the group. Can it be long before the others follow? Don't say: \"Geri, come back!\" Do say: \"Don't take any notice, Sporty, I like your haircut.\"",

If more people could be persuaded to stay in them, developers would have less incentive to despoil what remains of England's green and pleasant land. John Prescott's department put together a respectable range of measures to make cities more financially and visually acceptable to their inhabitants.</p> <p>Now look at the rural white paper. This certainly painted a less bleak picture of the countryside than its urban counterpart did about the cities. Nevertheless, the rural document highlighted problems such as falling farm incomes, declining village services, development pressures and isolation. New initiatives, funding programmes and local government changes are proposed. For example, there will be more money for rural policing, extra resources for affordable housing in the countryside, dramatic improvements in rural bus services and more powers for parish councils.</p> <p>No one would oppose the proposed improvements to countryside services. For the poor, the non-car-owning and victims of crime in rural parts of the country there will always be a need for better public provision. The difficulty is that while problems in rural areas tend to centre on the poverty and difficulties of a minority of individuals, the white paper's solutions will have the effect of making the countryside as a whole even more attractive than it already is.</p> <p>Urban areas would, without public intervention, have major advantages over rural ones. The provision of new technology, for example, is already far more widespread in the cities than elsewhere. Other things being equal, the benefits of agglomeration (as economists are fond of calling them) point to significant advantages for large towns and cities. Yet governments of all parties feel the need to bring such urban advantages to the most rural of areas. Universal telephone and postal services are provided by way of cross-subsidies from towns and cities.</p> <p>The rural white paper makes clear how the government intervenes to bring the technological advantages of urban concentration to rural areas: \"the market alone will not deliver affordable high-speed connections to all rural areas. We will therefore work through the development agencies to develop effective strategies for the roll-out of higher bandwidth (new cable and/or wireless links) services in rural areas, taking full advantage of public sector investment\".</p> <p>Though the urban paper makes similar commit ments, in effect, people living in the countryside - likely to be better off anyway - are to be publicly subsidised to bring the advantages of urban life to their doorsteps. It is small wonder that people who can afford it flock away from the grime and poor services of (particularly) the older, northern cities. By moving to rural areas, they enjoy less stressed schools and hospitals, cleaner air and a chance of living somewhere with which they are really satisfied. Better still, governments of all parties will guarantee that universal service provision is subsidised so all the relative advantages of the cities are on tap.</p> <p>This is not to argue that people - particularly the vulnerable and children - who live in the countryside should be deprived of modern facilities and opportunities. But it is important to understand that society's kindly Fabian desire to ensure that no one, even in the most remote areas, should be denied a fuller set of public and private services than could be provided without subsidy is removing our cities' main advantage.</p> <p>So the government's urban and rural white papers will, between them, provide both urban and country areas with marginal new advantages. However, by giving the countryside new and better public services, there must be the risk that even more people will want to go and live there. It is easier to put on new bus services in country lanes than to remove dereliction and deprivation from inner-city housing estates. The paradox is that stopping the urban exodus would probably require less government action to make rural areas attractive.</p> <p>Tony Travers is director of the Greater London group at the London School of Economics</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:A.Travers@lse.ac.uk\">A.Travers@lse.ac.uk</a></p>",

Yet governments of all parties feel the need to bring such urban advantages to the most rural of areas. Universal telephone and postal services are provided by way of cross-subsidies from towns and cities. The rural white paper makes clear how the government intervenes to bring the technological advantages of urban concentration to rural areas: \"the market alone will not deliver affordable high-speed connections to all rural areas. We will therefore work through the development agencies to develop effective strategies for the roll-out of higher bandwidth (new cable and/or wireless links) services in rural areas, taking full advantage of public sector investment\". Though the urban paper makes similar commit ments, in effect, people living in the countryside - likely to be better off anyway - are to be publicly subsidised to bring the advantages of urban life to their doorsteps. It is small wonder that people who can afford it flock away from the grime and poor services of (particularly) the older, northern cities. By moving to rural areas, they enjoy less stressed schools and hospitals, cleaner air and a chance of living somewhere with which they are really satisfied. Better still, governments of all parties will guarantee that universal service provision is subsidised so all the relative advantages of the cities are on tap. This is not to argue that people - particularly the vulnerable and children - who live in the countryside should be deprived of modern facilities and opportunities. But it is important to understand that society's kindly Fabian desire to ensure that no one, even in the most remote areas, should be denied a fuller set of public and private services than could be provided without subsidy is removing our cities' main advantage. So the government's urban and rural white papers will, between them, provide both urban and country areas with marginal new advantages. However, by giving the countryside new and better public services, there must be the risk that even more people will want to go and live there. It is easier to put on new bus services in country lanes than to remove dereliction and deprivation from inner-city housing estates. The paradox is that stopping the urban exodus would probably require less government action to make rural areas attractive.

Two types of hydrogel implant, which were vigorously promoted in women's magazines by cosmetic surgery clinics following the silicone scare in the United States, have been banned from sale in Britain as a precautionary measure. They are the poly implant prosthesis, manufactured in France, and NovaGold, from Germany. The government insists nobody has been harmed or is likely to be damaged, but the announcement will cause more distress among women with breast implants, some of whom have had the operation to restore their shape following a mastectomy.

Steve Watson, 33, and Barry Vardon, 34, had been on remand awaiting an appeal at Luton crown court against their original three month prison sentences for common assault. Madonna tried for Althorp date Madonna wrote to Earl Spencer for permission to marry British film director Guy Ritchie at Althorp House, where Diana, Princess of Wales is buried. A spokesman for Althorp said they could not provide the facilities wanted by Madonna who is to marry in Scotland next week. Ballet blow for 'Billy Elliot' The ballet hopes of a real-life Billy Elliot took a blow yesterday when the high court ruled that he was not entitled to a discretionary education grant to keep him at a private dance school. Birmingham city council was not under a duty to provide \"a Utopian system\" to educate Jacob Youngson, 13, \"to his maximum potential\". Allergy risk in cosmetics Ingredients in cosmetics known to cause allergic reactions in some people are not included on labels, Health Which? claims. It also suggests that the way other ingredients are listed can often be confusing. Christmas card from police Northamptonshire police yesterday sent Christmas cards asking people who are wanted on warrants to hand themselves in. Inspector Ian Kelly, of Corby police, said: \"We wanted to give people a chance to wipe the slate clean.\" Go-ahead for Islamic centre The high court rejected a challenge against a decision to allow an Islamic centre to be built on land owned by Magdalen college. Protesters said the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies, with a 75ft dome and 108ft tower, would swallow up a green field site near the River Cherwell.

      "body": "<p>I was delighted when friends telephoned to tell me that part of my sculpture, a commission for the Medway towns representing the past and future of the River Medway, had appeared in your paper (December 6). For the record I am indeed Sam Holland, Samantha to my family and friends, and female in gender, or so I have always assumed. The Sam does lead to confusion but is useful since, even in the 21st century, male sculptors are often taken more seriously by those who have power in the art world.</p> <p>This commission has been an exciting and demanding experience which has taken three years to complete. Although I'm sure my clients would have been delighted with the bargain price of \u00a32,500, the finished work cost in excess of \u00a3150,000. This was raised by local business and the community at large.</p> <p>I am a young sculptor (34, since when it's a woman you always like to know the age!). My studio is in the Historic Dockyard in Chatham, Kent and I have indeed worked at St Pauls and other wonderful venues. I am perhaps at my happiest when working on large public works and thank you again for printing the wonderful photograph <br><b>Sam Holland </b><br> Chatham, Kent</p> <p>\u0095 I thought I was perhaps the only woman on the Public Appointees Register who was not getting any appointments, until I read your interview with Carol Tongue (Cherchez les femmes, December 7).</p> <p>This government was elected with particular support from women, and an apparent commitment to involving the many in public life, and not the few under the Old Pals' Act we were only too familiar with from previous governments. The Labour government does indeed have prominent women, and all power to their elbows - but a very few are trying to do all the jobs. The political point about women is our sheer numbers. The Labour party also has in its own ranks a high proportion of able and active women. Our face, it now seems, doesn't fit. This relates, of course, to your campaign to challenge the monarchy and the culture of deference which monarchy symbolises and entrenches. Women - know your place! And that's not in public life, don't you know... <br><b> Barbara Rogers </b><br> London</p> <p>\u0095 I read with interest your article on contraception (Morning after pill to go on sale, December 11), not least for the assumptions contained within. First, it is assumed that contraception is the responsibility of the woman only</p> <p>Dr Liam Fox appears to think that any female over 16 can be described as a \"girl\" who cannot make responsible decisions about sexual activity or contraception.

      "bodyText": "I was delighted when friends telephoned to tell me that part of my sculpture, a commission for the Medway towns representing the past and future of the River Medway, had appeared in your paper (December 6). For the record I am indeed Sam Holland, Samantha to my family and friends, and female in gender, or so I have always assumed. The Sam does lead to confusion but is useful since, even in the 21st century, male sculptors are often taken more seriously by those who have power in the art world. This commission has been an exciting and demanding experience which has taken three years to complete. Although I'm sure my clients would have been delighted with the bargain price of \u00a32,500, the finished work cost in excess of \u00a3150,000. This was raised by local business and the community at large. I am a young sculptor (34, since when it's a woman you always like to know the age!). My studio is in the Historic Dockyard in Chatham, Kent and I have indeed worked at St Pauls and other wonderful venues. I am perhaps at my happiest when working on large public works and thank you again for printing the wonderful photograph Sam Holland Chatham, Kent \u0095 I thought I was perhaps the only woman on the Public Appointees Register who was not getting any appointments, until I read your interview with Carol Tongue (Cherchez les femmes, December 7). This government was elected with particular support from women, and an apparent commitment to involving the many in public life, and not the few under the Old Pals' Act we were only too familiar with from previous governments. The Labour government does indeed have prominent women, and all power to their elbows - but a very few are trying to do all the jobs. The political point about women is our sheer numbers. The Labour party also has in its own ranks a high proportion of able and active women. Our face, it now seems, doesn't fit. This relates, of course, to your campaign to challenge the monarchy and the culture of deference which monarchy symbolises and entrenches. Women - know your place! And that's not in public life, don't you know... Barbara Rogers London \u0095 I read with interest your article on contraception (Morning after pill to go on sale, December 11), not least for the assumptions contained within. First, it is assumed that contraception is the responsibility of the woman only Dr Liam Fox appears to think that any female over 16 can be described as a \"girl\" who cannot make responsible decisions about sexual activity or contraception. The role of \"boys\" is conveniently forgotten. This is not helpful. Second, many women who have used the morning after pill will have already made sound attempts to ensure that they do not become pregnant. Thus, many demands for the morning after pill will be the result of accidents such as a spilt condom, not casual, unprotected sex. Third, the article assumes that any incidence of unprotected sex will result in conception. Many women will in fact not have conceived and the pill will be a precautionary measure only. The pill cannot be described as an \"abortion pill\". Finally, it is disappointing that the pill may cost as much as \u00a320, possibly beyond the budget of many of those who do not want to become part of that much-maligned population, the single mother.

In 1987 prime minister Margaret Thatcher lit up the front of the building with lasers, and promised that she would be back the next year to open the Edwardian fairground theme park for Tory-sympathising impresario John Broome. A year later the building was a gutted ruin, with costs spiralling out of control and planning battles raging, including bitter disputes with English Heritage over the treatment of the landmark building. In the interim, the other listed London giant by architect Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, Bankside power station, was reborn as Tate Modern, and has attracted over 3m visitors in its first eight months. Battersea, with its unmistakable upended table legs outline, is regarded as the more architecturally striking building. Parkview, Mr Hwang's Hong Kong-based development company, acquired the Battersea site in south London in 1993, but it has taken until now to acquire planning permission for a complex of offices, shops, hotels, cinemas, restaurants and other leisure facilities, and the 2,000 seater circus space.

Researchers who tested the hearing of 127 German MPs found that, whether because of the hours spent alongside megaphones on the hustings, or because of some previously unsuspected link between partial deafness and overarching ambition, 42% were aurally challenged. Among MPs over the age of 40, the problem was especially worrying, the researchers said. It was the second time in a few weeks that the German voting public has been given cause to worry about its MPs. Last month, a current affairs programme reported that its researchers had found extensive traces of cocaine in lavatories throughout the Reichstag in Berlin, the home of Germany's lower house.",

It is on the main road to Lumbumbashi, the southern city that is the headquarters for the 12,000 Zimbabwean troops in Congo.</p> <p>Zimbabwean and Congolese troops are now fortifying Kasenga, the only major town between Pweto and Lumbumbashi.

      "bodyText": "Zimbabwean troops fighting in the Congo war have fled the strategic town of Pweto, which has fallen to the Rwandan-backed rebels, the Zimbabwean government confirmed yesterday. A contingent of 1,200 Zimbabwean and Congolese troops was pushed back across the border into Zambia, where they were disarmed and put into a refugee camp. The Zambians have asked Harare to take custody of its soldiers. The Zimbabwean government called the fall of Pweto \"regrettable\" but added that the retreat of its troops was merely to avoid any breach of the ceasefire agreement signed in Harare last week. More than 60,000 Congolese civilians have fled the fighting around Pweto and are currently in Zambia, according to UN estimates. Fierce fighting has raged around Pweto, on Lake Mweru in south-eastern Congo, where a Zimbabwean MiG fighter jet was reportedly shot down by the rebels. The fall of Pweto is a serious blow to the Zimbabwean forces backing the Congolese president, Laurent Kabila. It is on the main road to Lumbumbashi, the southern city that is the headquarters for the 12,000 Zimbabwean troops in Congo. Zimbabwean and Congolese troops are now fortifying Kasenga, the only major town between Pweto and Lumbumbashi. The new campaign by the rebels of the Congolese Rally for Democracy and their Rwandan backers is pressing into territory that had been considered firmly controlled by the Zimbabwean and Congolese government forces. Lumbumbashi, Congo's second largest city and the capital of Katanga province, is near Mr Kabila's home and the centre of his support. It would be a devastating blow to the president and his Zimbabwean allies if Lumbumbashi were to come under siege by the rebels. Harare provides little information about its involvement in the distant and unpopular Congo war, more than 620 miles to the north. The high cost of the war has been blamed for the drastic decline in Zimbabwe's economy.",

      "body": "<p>Ralph Bates, who has died in New York, aged 101, was the oldest survivor of that legendary group of British writers who gave their energies, their writings, and - in some cases - their lives to the cause of the Spanish republic in its doomed fight against fascism in the 1930s.</p> <p>At some point in the 15 years before the Spanish civil war broke out in 1937, he was a communist trade union agitator and organiser in the docks and fishing industries of Catalonia, where he became a fluent speaker of Spanish and Catalan. His knowledge of Spanish working-class and peasant life would turn him into one of the Comintern's best experts on Spain; it also gave his Spanish stories and novels their extraordinarily intimate power in realistic description.</p> <p>Bates resigned from the Communist party when the cynical Stalin-Hitler pact was signed in 1939. In 1941, he settled in New York and wrote to urge the US's entry into the second world war. From 1948 to 1968, he taught creative writing and other literary topics at New York University. Like so many Spanish war returnees, he came to the baleful attention of the House UnAmerican Activities Committee. He refused to testify.</p> <p>Bates was born into a family of railway engineers in Swindon, Wiltshire. Family stories about a seafaring great-grandfather, who captained his own trampsteamer around the Mediterranean and was buried in Cadiz, fuelled his boyhood dreams of adventure and Spain.</p> <p>A musical child, he played the organ in local churches. He left school at a then normal early age, was apprenticed in the railway workshops, and served his time as a fitter, turner and erector. Aged 17, he volunteered for first world war service, and, after failing to get into the Royal Flying Corps (seemingly on medical grounds), served as an infantryman in the 16th Queen's Royal West Surreys, achieving the rank of lance corporal.</p> <p>Demobilised, he returned to the Swindon railway works, where he started to be drawn into Labour politics. By 1923 he had joined the Communist party. But the childhood lure of further places was strong, and he was soon off to Paris, where he had a job as a street-cleaner. Then he worked his passage on a ship to Spain, where he bummed around, surviving on odd jobs. He also got to see his great-grandfather's grave.</p> <p>Bates was a man of fabled energy - organising unions, swimming and climbing. The Spaniards dubbed him El fantastico . But he needed money, and that, he said later, was what drove him to take up writing. He was in touch with literary comrades and friends in London - indeed, he seems to have travelled back and forth quite a bit between Spain and London - and it was London publishers who took him up.</p> <p>His first novel, Sierra (1933), went straight to the scenes and doings he knew at first-hand - the anxieties of a Spain oppressed in the agitated period before the civil war broke out in July 1937, by brutal policing, a bloodthirsty Roman church, and the utter harshness of the Spanish earth itself. The novel ends, characteristically, with civil guards gunning down a demonstration of republicans.</p> <p>This was apprentice stuff, certainly, but Bates was speedily batting himself in as a fine, revolutionary realist. Quickly, he went on to produce two undoubted classics of uprising Spain: Lean Men (1934), about an English communist agitator - evidently based upon himself - up against an overwhelmingly cruel and powerful state, and The Olive Field (1936), a strong story of yet more unsuccessful revolutionary struggles, but with the emphasis much more on mere work, in this case life among the cultivators of olive trees.</p> <p>The Olive Field will last. It stands out among the \"proletarian\" fiction of the 1930s as a revelatory and sympathetic inside story of people making a living at the jagged edges of survival. Rainbow Fish: Four Short Novels (1937), set widely across Europe, is far more ordinary; the shock mixture of Spanish violence, cruelty and utopian aspiration is clearly what Bates's imagination needed to thrive on.</p> <p>When the civil war erupted, he was straightaway thrown into the heat of things. Well acquainted with the Pyrenees, he guided incoming volunteers across the passes and took part in fighting with the militias. He was quickly made a commissar in the International Brigades, edited their English-language paper, Volunteer For Liberty, and wrote propaganda pieces about the war for London journals, such as Left Review. Winifred, his first wife, worked as a nurse.</p> <p>In 1937, Bates was sent by the Communist party to the United States to drum up financial support and attract more volunteers. There were huge rallies in venues such as Madison Square Gardens, and he became a darling of the American left. At one such meeting he met Eve Haxman, whom he married in 1942, following his divorce from Winifred.</p> <p>When the Spanish republic collapsed at the beginning of 1939, Bates retreated to Mexico. His novel, The Fields Of Paradise (1941), is set there; but even though this story of civil conflict reads like a transposition of Spanish events to the New World, it lacks the Spanish force that energises Bates's fiction at its best.</p> <p>In The Miraculous Horde, the collection issued in the autumn of 1939, the Spanish stories - about early-1930s trades union struggles, and famous battles involving the International Brigades, on the Jarama, at Brunete, in Aragon - are so much better than the Mexican ones. No one surpassed Bates for nice ironies about the mixed human material in the republican militias, or for movingly melancholic reflections on a struggle about which its participants felt increasingly pessimistic.</p> <p>In one of his best Spanish pieces, Compa\u00f1ero Sagasta Burns A Church, published in Left Review in October 1936, Bates pays understanding tribute to the Spanish anarchist's need to calmly burn out the signs and symbols of religious oppression; he was very ready to go along with what WH Auden called \"the necessary murder\" in a revolutionary cause. But he also dwells compellingly on the fatalism of anarchists - the belief that, at bottom, anarchism, \"noble, just and beautiful\", is \"unrealisable\" and therefore doomed.</p> <p>When he wrote this, Bates's line was that, by contrast, communism was not only noble but also realisable. Soon though, he was, like so many Spain veterans, thinking otherwise. It sounds as if he was helped to his disillusionment with politics by the dawning realisation that it was perverse, communist-led infighting, of the kind he was closely involved in, that had helped lose the war.

There were no successors in the biography line to his rather successful Life Of Schubert (1934), but he did try again with novels.

      "bodyText": "Japan's unpopular prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, suffered a new setback yesterday with the publication of photographs that allegedly show him sharing a cosy drink with an alleged rightwing extremist and convicted murderer. Coming just weeks after Mr Mori scraped through a no-confidence vote in parliament, the pictures put fresh pressure on the gaffe-prone leader to stand down. They also raise questions about the tactics of Japanese tabloids. The two black-and-white photographs appeared in the Weekly Gendai magazine, published yesterday. The magazine says the first shot shows a beaming Mr Mori posing with the leader of a violent rightwing group during a party at an Osaka restaurant two years ago. In the second picture, reportedly taken at an intimate bar, the man rests his hand with apparent familiarity on Mr Mori's shoulder. Gendai says the pictures were taken after a fundraising event in October 1998, when Mr Mori was secretary general of the ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP). The magazine describes the man with Mr Mori as a well-known rightwinger with links to the Japanese gangsters, known as yakuza . It claims he served several long prison sentences for murder and attempted murder. But Gendai does not give his name and he is referred to only as \"Mr A\". His face is deliberately obscured by a computer-generated mosaic. The magazine said the disguise was necessary to protect the man's privacy. Given such restrictions, the expos\u00e9 raises more questions than it answers, but Gendai said it was up to the prime minister to clarify his relationship with the man. Mr Mori has responded by suing the magazine, denying any knowledge of the man's identity. \"This involves the prime minister's personal honour,\" said Yasuo Fukuda, a government spokesman. Weekly magazines in Japan often break important stories that the staid broadsheets are reluctant to touch, but their methods are controversial. It is not the first time that Mr Mori has been linked to mobsters and extremists. In May he admitted giving a speech at a wedding attended by the head of a major crime syndicate, though he said he did not know who would be on the guest list. Last month his right-hand man, Hidenao Nakagawa, was forced to resign as chief cabinet secretary amid claims of drug use and alleged ties with an ultra-nationalist group. Such scandals and a prolonged succession of gaffes have made Mr Mori one of the most loathed prime ministers in Japanese history. He was almost deposed last month by a rebellion in his party, but he managed to cling to power, thanks mainly to the support of heavyweight LDP politicians. The latest sign of his weakness came last week when he appointed two former prime ministers - Kiichi Miyazawa and Ryutaro Hashimoto - and a handful of potential rivals to his cabinet, over which he will find it hard to exert leadership. Until yesterday the reshuffle appeared to have halted the slide in his popularity. In the latest poll by the broadcaster NHK, Mr Mori's approval rating has risen to 22% from 17% the previous month. This latest scandal threatens to send him back under 20%, which is considered the make-or-break mark. LDP powerbrokers are said to be plotting a way to remove Mr Mori before he further damages its chances in this summer's upper house elections. His position seems weaker than that of the alleged rightwinger in the photographs. It has been claimed that Gendai's protection of the man's identity suggests that taking on Mr Mori is less frightening than taking on the mob.",

It is also difficult for the Japanese government to turn a blind eye to the fact that Mr Fujimori adopted a second nationality.

While he was in office, Mr Fujimori denied speculation that he retained Japanese citizenship, though he kept close ties with the country and his son lives there. The Peruvian authorities want to question Mr Fujimori about his relationship with his former spymaster Vladimiro Montesinos, who is at the centre of a money-laundering, drug-dealing and bribery scandal.

A new regulation in Anhui province, banning the use of ultrasound scanners to determine the gender of foetuses, has been given national publicity after a survey from the region, reported by the official New China News Agency, revealed that \"an unbalanced proportion [of boys]\" had been born over the last six years. Figures for mothers giving birth to a second child showed that three boys were being born for every girl. This discrepancy is attributed to the \"deliberate termination of the child\" by parents who discover through ultrasound examination that the foetus is female. Researchers say that many couples still cling to the traditional preference to have at least one boy, especially if their first child is a girl. Male offspring are regarded as having more value in China's privatised rural economy. The ban in Anhui is intended to reinforce a widely ignored national prohibition on the use of ultrasound in pregnancy, except for medical reasons. The 1995 Maternal and Child Health Law already bans the termination of pregnancies because of the sex of the foetus. However, the law is unlikely to be enforced locally unless backed up by provincial legislation. \"Ultrasound for [sex] selection is rampant,\" a UN health expert in Beijing said. \"There is no regulation on who can own them or not, and people can generate a good return by charging for their use.\" Rural government health centres, where doctors' incomes are now largely dependent on patients' fees, have been defying the national ban for years.

      "bodyText": "Paralympian Tanni Grey-Thompson has got used to receiving awards in recognition of her outstanding sporting ability, but a simple oversight by the BBC denied her the chance of collecting her latest accolade in front of an audience of millions. A failure by television bosses to provide a ramp to enable the athlete to access the stage in her wheelchair meant that she could not go up and accept her third prize at the Sports Personality of the Year awards screened on Sunday night. The disabled athlete was being honoured for winning four gold medals in the Sydney Paralympics, which brought the total number of medals she has amassed in her long Paralympic career to nine. The lack of a ramp at the Television Centre studios in west London meant that she was unable to join rower Steve Redgrave, winner of five Olympic gold medals, and Olympic heptathlon gold medallist Denise Lewis when they went up to collect the first and second prizes. The oversight was criticised by the Disability Rights Commission, which yesterday launched its first campaign, backed by the prime minister Tony Blair, aimed at getting organisations to make a practical commitment to helping disabled people participate more fully in society. Bert Massie, chair of the DRC, said the incident high lighted how disabled people were prevented from fully participating in all sorts of ways. \"Tanni Grey-Thompson's experience shows even the most successful disabled people face discrimination. There is a need for action and it is needed now,\" he added. The BBC, which is one of the signatories to the campaign, yesterday apologised to Mrs Grey-Thompson, who accepted it was an oversight. The BBC's director of sport, Peter Salmon, said: \"Failing to meet the needs of Tanni during the programme was an error from which we will learn. He added: \"Disabled athletics has come to the fore partially as a result of our efforts and we want to improve our coverage still more.\" In a joint press release with the BBC, Mrs Grey-Thompson said that she did not want the oversight to be turned into an issue. She added: \"There is a danger that the unfortunate error of the missing ramp on the programme will be exploited as an issue and undo much of the good work that has been achieved for disabled athletics. I want to continue working with the BBC to increase recognition and support for disabled people.\" She also won last night's special accolade, the Helen Rollason award, for outstanding achievement in the face of adversity. She was presented with the award by last year's winner, racehorse trainer Jenny Pitman.",

Its owner, whose face is oddly familiar, despite the fact that he is some nondescript middling fellow who belongs more to the fields and farmland than to the town itself, has just suffered an astonishing and quite unprovoked indignity. </p> <p>A few minutes before, this bumpkin was taking a turn on the street. A bird sang on the far side of an ivy-covered wall, a jackdaw cawed around the old church spire. An innocent abroad, he was crossing the street as a horse-drawn carriage with two men in fine green livery clattered past when, as a clock struck the hour, he was kicked in the pants by a complete stranger - kicked, kicked and kicked again by a finely tooled, pointed leather boot, whose owner is the bumpkin's exact double, but a double who has gone up in the world - a dandy who lashes out, we suppose, just because he can. </p> <p>It is rare that an artist produces a helpful little pocket guide to his own exhibition. The Canadian Rodney Graham has written about his film City Self Country Self (Paris Street Scene, 1865) in the guide to his current Lisson Gallery show. The dandy, the bumpkin and Graham are one and the same. And Rodney Graham, the hot-shot avant-garde Vancouver artist, is also the Rodney Graham who, wearing a sensible jumper, sits at the foot of a tree, guitar in hand, on the cover of the album Getting It Together in the Country, a record that, by the look of it, belongs in the MOR/folk section of a second-hand record store. </p> <p>It is not unknown for artists to also write, play and sing their own songs on well-produced CDs. Lots of artists have bands (Martin Creed's art band OWADA, for example), but they don't generally deserve to make it big. I am playing one of Graham's other recordings as I write this - The Bed-Bug, Love Buzz \"and other short songs in the popular idiom\", produced for Graham's Dia Foundation double-handed show with Bruce Nauman earlier this year. </p> <p>Graham's wry, witty electro-pop and acoustic tunes have beaten everything else to take this week's top slot in our flat. Graham sometimes sounds a bit like Nick Cave, is reminiscent at times of Stereolab and Nirvana, among others, but is mostly, unmistakably himself. The songs, and his laconic vioice, stay in your head, just the way good pop ought to. There can't be anything wrong with a smooth easy-listening number called Man, I Really Miss the Coast, which contains the rhyme \"Sigmund Freud is still The Most\". </p> <p>For the Lisson Gallery, Graham has brought out a new CD, What Is Happy, Baby?, a short set of five acoustic tracks, including a cover of George Harrison's Blue Jay Way (from the Beatles' Magical Mystery Tour album). All this is confusing, given Graham's reputation as a sometimes daunting, fearsomely intellectual artist who once took a couple of years out from his practice as an artist to study Freud's dropping of his medical vocation in favour of what, in essence, was a science of his own invention. But perhaps here is the key to Graham's own waywardness. </p> <p>Graham has also written a novel - The System of Landor's Cottage - which the author describes as \"a pendant to Poe's last story... itself described by Poe as a pendant to an earlier tale\", which was called The Domain of Arnheim. Graham's novel appears in the show, but in the form of 158 framed pages, translated back into English, by 14 commercial translation companies, from an earlier translation into French of Graham's \"original\" story. You don't actually want to read a novel presented like this. Why did Graham go through this crazy procedure? At one level, like his dandy, because he could. </p> <p>\"I have always wanted to be a French novelist, particularly Raymond Roussel,\" notes Graham. The sheer copiousness of much of Graham's oeuvre, its proliferating footnotes, its cross-references and self-annotations - wheels within wheels, endless cycles, great arcing digressions and metaphoric lunacies - can wind even the hardiest. Life is too short for this, I hear you say. </p> <p>Anyway, what's the point? It turns out that much as Graham's work is a kind of language game, he lives in the real world, unlike Roussel, whose entire life was one vast exquisite evasion. Graham's work is as often light-hearted and entertaining as it is mysterious, serious, troubling and full of conundrums. It is filled, too, with ordinary human foibles, failings and enthusiasms. </p> <p>\"Say what you will, modern life remains a bitter pill... what is happy baby?\" sings Graham. Happiness, it turns out, can only ever be a matter of making associations, giving meaning to things, but remembering that the real is out there somewhere too, as yet unmediated by thought or art. </p> <p> Here's Graham, fishing on a jetty, rod in hand. Vancouver rises across the bay behind him. When I first saw it in New York, this photo-piece bothered me, but more as a fisherman than as an art critic. Not even on the poshest Scottish salmon beat would anyone dress as nattily as Graham does here: crisp white shirt, sharply pressed slacks, immaculate trilby and cool black waistcoat. His tackle is also unbalanced, and Graham piscator doesn't look like he knows how to hold his reel. </p> <p>It turns out that he is only pretending to fish, and the entire constructed and digitally reworked image is a copy of a still from Hitchcock's To Catch a Thief, in which Cary Grant pretends to fish as a ruse to go unnoticed in Hong Kong. Pretence is at the heart of this work. I was bothered then for the right reason, and had seen through Graham's (and Grant's) disguise. Cary Grant, playing John Robie, was really called Archibald Leach. Graham's work is about not working, but fishing, not even fishing but... you get the point. </p> <p>It is the middle of the 19th century, a mild autumn day, a little before noon. A pompous self-satisfied bourgeois dandy checks his pocket-watch. His face is oddly familiar. He has just had his shoes shined. Crossing the street as a carriage with two liveried men clatters past, and on the stroke of 12, he comes up behind some country fellow and kicks him up the arse, because he can. </p> <p>A black top hat rolls on the cobbles. The dandy finds his mark. Rodney Graham, with what he calls an \"injury laugh\", a bit of clownish busi ness as old as the hills, finds his mark too, again because he can. </p> <p>Graham's film, in which his city self and country self (with a bit of help from a body double in a latex face mask) re-enact their endless cycle of oppression, is a narrative engine that plunges us into strangeness. We are amused, and struck by a multitude of enjoyable little filmic details. </p> <p>This vignette - based on an image in a French children's book that Graham once saw, and then misplaced, might remind us of Dostoevsky's The Double, except that here we do not know which is the doppelg\u00e4nger, which the authentic personage of the film, or which is the real Rodney Graham. Who cares - just dig the music. </p> <p>\u0095 Rodney Graham: What Is Happy, Baby? is at the Lisson Gallery, London NW1 (020-7724 2739), until January 27.</p>",

Graham's film, in which his city self and country self (with a bit of help from a body double in a latex face mask) re-enact their endless cycle of oppression, is a narrative engine that plunges us into strangeness. We are amused, and struck by a multitude of enjoyable little filmic details. This vignette - based on an image in a French children's book that Graham once saw, and then misplaced, might remind us of Dostoevsky's The Double, except that here we do not know which is the doppelg\u00e4nger, which the authentic personage of the film, or which is the real Rodney Graham. Who cares - just dig the music. \u0095 Rodney Graham: What Is Happy, Baby? is at the Lisson Gallery, London NW1 (020-7724 2739), until January 27.",

      "bodyText": "A United Nations conference on fighting organised crime will open in Sicily today as new evidence emerges that the Mafia is reclaiming the island. The organisers had hoped that the improvement in the island's image after an eight-year crackdown on the Mafia would encourage the representatives of 110 governments to sign an anti-mafia treaty. But a report leaked yesterday from the prosecutor's office in Palermo named 329 politicians, law enforcers and businessmen suspected of colluding with the criminal clans. Judges admitted that the clans, far from being smashed, had rebuilt their networks and begun infiltrating Sicily's new generation of leaders. The report, drawn from evidence given by supergrasses, identified those the Mafia considered allies or potential allies. In descending scale of their alleged involvement, magistrates, policemen, civil servants, doctors, bankers, entrepreneurs and mayors were listed as being \"men of honour\", \"approachable\", or \"available\". La Stampa, the newspaper which broke the story, said the rollcall raised the question whether Sicily had indeed been freed from fear. Improved communications and more fluid borders have been a boon to money laundering and trafficking in humans, drugs and weapons. The treaty, which must be signed and ratified by at least 40 governments to become international law, will try to close the criminal opportunities offered by globalisation. Its signatories will be committed to adopting uniform laws, streamlining extradition, protecting witnesses, confiscating criminal assets and pooling information. The UN billed the conference as a breakthrough in empowering law enforcers to fight transnational crime. Its organisers chose Palermo because it was the symbol of victory against organised crime. Sicily was to be the model for tackling criminal networks spanning the far east, Russia, the Balkans, western Europe and the Americas. Included on the list of alleged Mafia contacts was the summit's host, Leoluca Orlando, mayor of Palermo. Perhaps Italy's best known anti-mafia crusader, his complicity if proved would be a sensation, but even his critics poured scorn on the accusation. Prosecutors said the allegation was made long ago by an unreliable supergrass, and no investigation is expected. La Stampa admitted that the supergrass accounts were at times contradictory and incoherent. Mr Orlando, 53, has been on a death list for most of the time he has overseen Palermo's rebirth. A Mafia challenge to the state in 1992, climaxing in the car-bomb murders of judges Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, prompted new laws and a prolonged crackdown. Mobsters such as Giovanni Brusca, who were persuaded to break omerta, the code of silence, implicated hundreds of colleagues in so-called \"maxi\" trials. Toto Riina, the boss of bosses, was sentenced to life and the former prime minister Giulio Andreotti, the organisation's alleged protector in Rome, was put on trial. The Mafia was brought to its knees. Little has been heard of it in recent years, not because it has disappeared but because it is lying low, regrouping and consolidating for a rebirth, judges and prosecutors say. The internal bloodletting of Riina's era has given way to cooperation and the return of the once formidable pyramidal structure, whereby a committee of clan representatives make policy and issue orders. Its latest known additions are updated on a heavily guarded CD-Rom in Palermo's prosecutors' office. The latest count is 190 clans with 5,192 members. The Palermo region alone has 89 families with 3,201 members. They range from the Brancaccios, whose 203 members run rackets and drugs, to a two-member operation in the Vucciria food market. Trapani, on Sicily's western tip, comes next with 982 members, followed by Agrigento, Caltanissetta, Catania, Enna, Messina and Syracuse. Historically the Mafia has been weaker in the east. Running the show is the new boss of bosses, Bernardo Provenzano, known as \"the tractor\" for mowing people down. He has been on the run since 1963, raising the suspicion that he has bought off the police. Judicial morale has been sapped by the failure to convict Mr Andreotti and the gradual breakdown of the supergrass system, tarnished by false testimonies and crimes committed by those on witness-protection programmes. The burgeoning trade of people trafficking has been boosted by alliances with Balkan and Chinese gangs. Quietly cultivating new friends, the Mafia has also plugged into the legitimate economy, buying into supermarkets, banks, government bonds and internet companies. \"The Mafia searches not only for profits but also power. It needs rapport with politicians and institutions,\" said Piero Grasso, the head of Palermo's prosecution service. Traditional tactics of usury, bribery and extortion are reaping huge dividends.

      "body": "<p>With a thick scarf swaddling his ears from the bitter wind, Suresh Suthar grinned and repeated the one English phrase he recognised: \"minimum wage.\"</p> <p>One of 19 stonemasons brought from a remote, rural corner of northern India in April last year, he and his comrades have been paid a pittance to work on an elaborate Hindu temple under construction in Wembley, north London.</p> <p>Now, under threat of prosecution, the company that employs them has been forced to raise their wage from 30p an hour to the guaranteed minimum of \u00a33.70.</p> <p>It is still only a fraction of the \u00a36.35 an hour going rate for British stonemasons, but, with back pay, the Indian workers will get a \u00a3110,000 payout.</p> <p>A delighted Mr Suthar said that his share would go to pay for a \"big house\" for his wife and children, and perhaps help towards setting up a business in his native province of Dungarpur, in Rajasthan.</p> <p>The case has highlighted the risks of exploitation faced by foreign workers. Union campaigners spoke yesterday of the \"inhuman\" conditions in which the men have lived - in cramped, prefabricated huts on the building site with primitive kitchens and squalid toilets.</p> <p>A clause in the workers' contracts specified that the electricity supply would be cut off each night at 11pm on days when they were not working. Many of them were stripped of their passports and risked being deported if they complained.</p> <p>On the work permits on which the men were brought from India, they were promised between \u00a3160 and \u00a3190 a week, plus allowances, food and lodging. With an average annual salary in India of only \u00a3275, this was an excellent wage. But they were actually receiving only around \u00a3125 for a month of six day weeks. Their wages were paid in rupees to their families in India.</p> <p>George Brumwell, general secretary of the Union of Construction, Allied Trades and Technicians, said: \"We're delighted we've been able to highlight this, but we believe it is the tip of the iceberg in Britain's construction industry.</p> <p>\"We discovered this kind of thing going on as far back as eight years ago, when we found 24 Polish carpenters on a site in Yorkshire being paid \u00a32 an hour and they were living in a steel container.\"</p> <p>Mr Brumwell added: \"We welcome foreign skilled workers who can make a real contribution to the British economy, but what we won't have is people being ... exploited to line the pockets of employers.\"</p> <p>The company building the temple, Shrico, had argued that the men worked for its sister firm in India, which had drawn up the contracts. The men were then seconded to Britain to assemble the intricately carved blocks of stone which make up the temple building.</p> <p>It is understood that Shrico directors agreed to start paying the minimum wage, and make up the back pay, following the threat of a prosecution by Inland Revenue inspectors.</p> <p>Shrico is a subsidiary of the Shri Vallabh Nidhi charity, which is being investigated by the Charity Commission relating to \"administration and finances, particularly regarding the building of the new temple in Wembley\", a spokeswoman said.</p> <p>In September, the government relaxed rules on foreign workers coming to Britain to fill skills shortages. Under a pilot scheme, multinationals have been allowed to issue their own work permits to foreign staff.

      "bodyText": "With a thick scarf swaddling his ears from the bitter wind, Suresh Suthar grinned and repeated the one English phrase he recognised: \"minimum wage.\" One of 19 stonemasons brought from a remote, rural corner of northern India in April last year, he and his comrades have been paid a pittance to work on an elaborate Hindu temple under construction in Wembley, north London. Now, under threat of prosecution, the company that employs them has been forced to raise their wage from 30p an hour to the guaranteed minimum of \u00a33.70. It is still only a fraction of the \u00a36.35 an hour going rate for British stonemasons, but, with back pay, the Indian workers will get a \u00a3110,000 payout. A delighted Mr Suthar said that his share would go to pay for a \"big house\" for his wife and children, and perhaps help towards setting up a business in his native province of Dungarpur, in Rajasthan. The case has highlighted the risks of exploitation faced by foreign workers. Union campaigners spoke yesterday of the \"inhuman\" conditions in which the men have lived - in cramped, prefabricated huts on the building site with primitive kitchens and squalid toilets. A clause in the workers' contracts specified that the electricity supply would be cut off each night at 11pm on days when they were not working. Many of them were stripped of their passports and risked being deported if they complained. On the work permits on which the men were brought from India, they were promised between \u00a3160 and \u00a3190 a week, plus allowances, food and lodging. With an average annual salary in India of only \u00a3275, this was an excellent wage. But they were actually receiving only around \u00a3125 for a month of six day weeks. Their wages were paid in rupees to their families in India. George Brumwell, general secretary of the Union of Construction, Allied Trades and Technicians, said: \"We're delighted we've been able to highlight this, but we believe it is the tip of the iceberg in Britain's construction industry. \"We discovered this kind of thing going on as far back as eight years ago, when we found 24 Polish carpenters on a site in Yorkshire being paid \u00a32 an hour and they were living in a steel container.\" Mr Brumwell added: \"We welcome foreign skilled workers who can make a real contribution to the British economy, but what we won't have is people being ... exploited to line the pockets of employers.\" The company building the temple, Shrico, had argued that the men worked for its sister firm in India, which had drawn up the contracts. The men were then seconded to Britain to assemble the intricately carved blocks of stone which make up the temple building. It is understood that Shrico directors agreed to start paying the minimum wage, and make up the back pay, following the threat of a prosecution by Inland Revenue inspectors. Shrico is a subsidiary of the Shri Vallabh Nidhi charity, which is being investigated by the Charity Commission relating to \"administration and finances, particularly regarding the building of the new temple in Wembley\", a spokeswoman said. In September, the government relaxed rules on foreign workers coming to Britain to fill skills shortages. Under a pilot scheme, multinationals have been allowed to issue their own work permits to foreign staff. There were up to 20,000 applications to the scheme and companies including Rolls-Royce, Ernst &amp; Young and Sony UK have benefited. Howard Ewing, general secretary of the Low Pay Commission, said of the temple workers: \"This demonstrates that even if you import your workers and employ them in this country, you have got to pay at least the national minimum wage.\" There is concern among Britain's 1m-plus Hindu community that the scandal will tarnish their reputation. Yesterday, the Wembley temple's leaders seemed to pay little heed to good PR. When two of the workers approached a chainlink fence to speak to reporters, a member of the management committee shouted \"get back to work\" at them and threw the journalists off the site. A long way from home The pubs, grey pavements and double-decker buses of Wembley would have been an exotic sight for the Indian stonemasons, who all hail from the rural province of Dungarpur in the arid northern state of Rajasthan. A more familiar sight at home are the sacred cows who wander the hot and dusty streets chewing vegetable peel, and the ox carts lugging cargos of timber. A temple source said: \"These are not middle class people. They live in villages which have electricity - but only just about. \"You can see that from what they are going to do with the money. They are going to build proper houses with a good roof, and running water. \"In terms of the global marketplace, these people are towards the bottom.\" The men, who practise a skill handed down from father to son, were lured by promises of a wage that was good by Indian standards. \"But when they got here they were virtual prisoners, with their movement restricted and electricity cut off at night,\" the source said. Rajasthan is a popular destination for western travellers, and tourist guides describe Dungarpur as an area rich in teak and mango trees and noted for its wildlife.",

Team Philips will not now take part, but the possibility of entering other events has not been ruled out. Mr Goss was forced to abandon Team Philips during her fifth sea trial session - her most successful to date, reaching 35 knots in gale force winds and heavy seas. During the first trial in March a bow snapped off, and during her second in October problems developed with her unstayed 135-foot masts. Then crew member Mike Calvin quit, claiming to go for The Race would be \"madness\" because of insufficient time to prepare. When she set sail with on December 2, the racer seemed to have her problems behind her. She clocked up the 2,500 mile qualifying distance for The Race on her toughest voyage yet before disaster struck again. Press Association",

But for many, Mr Chirac - variously described as mercurial, arrogant, inconsiderate, self-interested and a bully - bears a large part of the blame.</p> <p>He managed to infuriate just about every non-French politician, diplomat and journalist with whom he came into contact. He wasted much of the first two days in rehearsing positions that were already clear from his tour of EU capitals over the previous weeks.</p> <p>\"This guy, he talks, he talks, he talks,\" Guy Verhofstadt, the Belgian prime minister, said to his Danish colleague, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, at one stage, before realising that the cameras were still rolling.</p> <p>Wim Kok, the Dutch prime minister, was equally disheartened by Mr Chirac's bullying bonhomie and single-minded pursuit of France's national interests during Friday's bilateral confessional meetings.</p> <p>Mr Chirac upset Britain with his continued attempts to force Tony Blair to drop his tax veto demands and annoyed his German counterpart, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, further straining already tense Franco-German rela tions. \"Good relations? What good relations?\" Mr Schr\u00f6der was reported to have asked.</p> <p>Mr Chirac also offended the president of the European commission, Romano Prodi, by shutting him out of key summit bilateral meetings and criticising him in front of fellow leaders for alleged mismanagement of the mad cow crisis.</p> <p>One German diplomat, who wanted to remain nameless, said: \"This whole thing, this summit, is being run according to the rules of a Middle-Eastern bazaar.\"</p> <p>The German press was vitriolic. \"Never was a summit conference so miserably prepared, rarely did one feel so little of the European spirit as during the days and nights at Nice,\" commented the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.</p> <p>Mr Chirac may yet suffer on the domestic stage once the French public realises that the compromise rule agreed with Germany enables Berlin to block EU decisions by allying itself with Italy and Britain.</p> <p>But for many, the Nice summit will go down in history as a reflection of the man who presided over it: illogical, irrational, given to tantrums, keen to score political points, preoccupied with national concerns - and bereft of any grand vision of Europe.</p> <p><b>Related special reports</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/IMF\">IMF and World Bank summit in Prague 2000</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/wto/\">World Trade Organisation summit 1999</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/m2k\">May2K demonstrations</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/debt/0,2759,178197,00.html\">Debt relief</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/emu\">Economic and monetary union</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/eurocommission/0,2759,180395,00.html\">European commission</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/europarl/0,2759,180401,00.html\">European parliament</a> <br><br><b>Interactive guide</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/flash/0,5860,408196,00.html\">How the European nations relate to each other</a> <br><br><b>Useful links</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.indymedia.org/\" target=\"_new\">Updates from protesters - Indymedia</a> <br><a href=\"http://europa.eu.int/comm/nice_council/index_en.htm\" target=\"_new\">Press release: Nice summit - EU</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "A few hours after the marathon five-day Nice summit ended, even its not-so-genial, puffed-up host, President Jacques Chirac, could only muster the word \"acceptable\" to describe the shambolic proceedings. It may be that Europe's leaders went to Nice in a frame of mind that ensured the end result would fall far short of expectations. But for many, Mr Chirac - variously described as mercurial, arrogant, inconsiderate, self-interested and a bully - bears a large part of the blame. He managed to infuriate just about every non-French politician, diplomat and journalist with whom he came into contact. He wasted much of the first two days in rehearsing positions that were already clear from his tour of EU capitals over the previous weeks. \"This guy, he talks, he talks, he talks,\" Guy Verhofstadt, the Belgian prime minister, said to his Danish colleague, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, at one stage, before realising that the cameras were still rolling. Wim Kok, the Dutch prime minister, was equally disheartened by Mr Chirac's bullying bonhomie and single-minded pursuit of France's national interests during Friday's bilateral confessional meetings. Mr Chirac upset Britain with his continued attempts to force Tony Blair to drop his tax veto demands and annoyed his German counterpart, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, further straining already tense Franco-German rela tions. \"Good relations? What good relations?\" Mr Schr\u00f6der was reported to have asked. Mr Chirac also offended the president of the European commission, Romano Prodi, by shutting him out of key summit bilateral meetings and criticising him in front of fellow leaders for alleged mismanagement of the mad cow crisis. One German diplomat, who wanted to remain nameless, said: \"This whole thing, this summit, is being run according to the rules of a Middle-Eastern bazaar.\" The German press was vitriolic. \"Never was a summit conference so miserably prepared, rarely did one feel so little of the European spirit as during the days and nights at Nice,\" commented the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. Mr Chirac may yet suffer on the domestic stage once the French public realises that the compromise rule agreed with Germany enables Berlin to block EU decisions by allying itself with Italy and Britain. But for many, the Nice summit will go down in history as a reflection of the man who presided over it: illogical, irrational, given to tantrums, keen to score political points, preoccupied with national concerns - and bereft of any grand vision of Europe.

      "body": "<p>Histories of the European Union will remember the Nice summit as a landmark moment when big governments won the big arguments - and left the integrationists reeling and humiliated at their loss of power.</p> <p>That much was clear in the early hours of yesterday morning, when exhausted leaders emerged pale and blinking from their marathon talks with a new treaty that delivers only modest reforms except in one area - confirming the unassailable dominance of the largest member states.</p> <p>Germany, Britain, and France, with the required 62% of the EU's total population, can now form a \"directory\" able to block virtually anything they want as the enlargement process gets under way.</p> <p>Re-weighting votes in the decision-making council of ministers - where the 15 governments cooperate to make policy - sets in concrete the drift towards a Europe not only of nation states, but of the biggest players in the bloc.</p> <p>Nice thus confirmed a trend evident for some time: at last March's Lisbon economic summit, prime ministers set a liberalising reform agenda and left the European Commission to play little more than a back-up role.</p> <p>In the summer, as leaders competed to make visionary speeches about the future of the union, France's Jacques Chirac failed to even mention the commission - the EU's unique supranational element where members agree to pool some sovereignty for the common good.</p> <p>Instead, to the horror of its battered president, Romano Prodi, the Gaullist president talked of a \"secretariat\" to service a \"pioneer group\" of big countries.</p> <p>It has not quite come to that, because the EU means different things to different people. Tony Blair signed up to a clause allowing \"flexibility\" so that integrationist-minded states which wish to act on their own can do so, as long as fundamentals like the single market are unaffected.</p> <p>Nice's advance on \"reinforced cooperation\" in Brussels jargon means, crucially, that the 12 members of the single currency cannot create new institutions that exclude non-participants like Britain, Denmark and Sweden.</p> <p>Mr Blair achieved most of what he set out in his recent Warsaw speech, when he linked institutional reforms to enlargement and advocated a bigger role for the council.</p> <p>Another big player, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, under pressure from Germany's federal states, got what he needed: a new intergovernmental conference in 2004 - a constitutional review, in other words - of the delimitation of powers between Brussels and national capitals. Future summits - at Goteborg in Sweden and Laeken in Belgium - will work out the contentious details. Chancellor Schr\u00f6der also won more power, but without having to bludgeon France into conceding that Germany's greater population size should mean that it has more votes.</p> <p>Nice's biggest loser is without doubt Mr Prodi, the former Italian prime minister chosen to head the commission after last year's sleaze scandals.</p> <p>\"I cannot hide from you a certain regret that we did not manage to go further,\" he said bravely. Five days haggling on the Riviera did remove some of what Mr Prodi calls the \"manacles\" of the national veto. Moves to majority voting in some 25-30 areas will help speed decision-making, with immigration matters (not affecting opt-out Britain) at the top of the list.</p> <p>Other articles will move to majority voting, but there are snags: Spain, backed by Portugal and Greece, ensured that funds for poorer states would be allocated by majority voting only from 2007, after the next EU budget in 2006, which runs for six years. That postpones real change until 2013. Worse still for Brussels, Nice excludes Britain's no-go areas of majority voting on indirect taxes in the single market and social security measures to facilitate the free movement of people.</p> <p>Jacques Chirac, who had repeated spats with Mr Prodi, held firm on trade policy, agreeing to drop his veto in new areas but excepting France's film and audio-visual industry to protect it from Hollywood and the global competition.</p> <p>Pascal Lamy, the trade commissioner, thus failed to see the union equipped with a single position for key negotiations with the World Trade Organisation. Small countries will regret the outcome: true, they held on to their commissioner, but in a battle whose terms were dictated by the big three states, they allowed themselves to be picked off.</p> <p>Members of the European Parliament were unhappy too as agreement to raise the previous threshold of MEPs to a record 740 reinforced the impression that it is little more than a consolation prize.</p> <p>Parliament has no power to throw out EU treaties, but Italy and Belgium have signalled that they will listen to its views when ratification comes round. Elmar Brok, a leading Christian Democrat, was scathing about the Riviera endgame: \"It will be more difficult to get a majority and makes procedure more difficult,\" he concluded grimly. \"The whole system becomes more and more complicated. I cannot see how citizens can understand it.\"</p> <p><b>Related special reports</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/IMF\">IMF and World Bank summit in Prague 2000</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/wto/\">World Trade Organisation summit 1999</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/m2k\">May2K demonstrations</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/debt/0,2759,178197,00.html\">Debt relief</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/emu\">Economic and monetary union</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/eurocommission/0,2759,180395,00.html\">European commission</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/europarl/0,2759,180401,00.html\">European parliament</a> <br><br><b>Interactive guide</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/flash/0,5860,408196,00.html\">How the European nations relate to each other</a> <br><br><b>Useful links</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.indymedia.org/\" target=\"_new\">Updates from protesters - Indymedia</a> <br><a href=\"http://europa.eu.int/comm/nice_council/index_en.htm\" target=\"_new\">Press release: Nice summit - EU</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Histories of the European Union will remember the Nice summit as a landmark moment when big governments won the big arguments - and left the integrationists reeling and humiliated at their loss of power. That much was clear in the early hours of yesterday morning, when exhausted leaders emerged pale and blinking from their marathon talks with a new treaty that delivers only modest reforms except in one area - confirming the unassailable dominance of the largest member states. Germany, Britain, and France, with the required 62% of the EU's total population, can now form a \"directory\" able to block virtually anything they want as the enlargement process gets under way. Re-weighting votes in the decision-making council of ministers - where the 15 governments cooperate to make policy - sets in concrete the drift towards a Europe not only of nation states, but of the biggest players in the bloc. Nice thus confirmed a trend evident for some time: at last March's Lisbon economic summit, prime ministers set a liberalising reform agenda and left the European Commission to play little more than a back-up role. In the summer, as leaders competed to make visionary speeches about the future of the union, France's Jacques Chirac failed to even mention the commission - the EU's unique supranational element where members agree to pool some sovereignty for the common good. Instead, to the horror of its battered president, Romano Prodi, the Gaullist president talked of a \"secretariat\" to service a \"pioneer group\" of big countries. It has not quite come to that, because the EU means different things to different people. Tony Blair signed up to a clause allowing \"flexibility\" so that integrationist-minded states which wish to act on their own can do so, as long as fundamentals like the single market are unaffected. Nice's advance on \"reinforced cooperation\" in Brussels jargon means, crucially, that the 12 members of the single currency cannot create new institutions that exclude non-participants like Britain, Denmark and Sweden. Mr Blair achieved most of what he set out in his recent Warsaw speech, when he linked institutional reforms to enlargement and advocated a bigger role for the council. Another big player, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, under pressure from Germany's federal states, got what he needed: a new intergovernmental conference in 2004 - a constitutional review, in other words - of the delimitation of powers between Brussels and national capitals. Future summits - at Goteborg in Sweden and Laeken in Belgium - will work out the contentious details. Chancellor Schr\u00f6der also won more power, but without having to bludgeon France into conceding that Germany's greater population size should mean that it has more votes. Nice's biggest loser is without doubt Mr Prodi, the former Italian prime minister chosen to head the commission after last year's sleaze scandals. \"I cannot hide from you a certain regret that we did not manage to go further,\" he said bravely. Five days haggling on the Riviera did remove some of what Mr Prodi calls the \"manacles\" of the national veto. Moves to majority voting in some 25-30 areas will help speed decision-making, with immigration matters (not affecting opt-out Britain) at the top of the list. Other articles will move to majority voting, but there are snags: Spain, backed by Portugal and Greece, ensured that funds for poorer states would be allocated by majority voting only from 2007, after the next EU budget in 2006, which runs for six years. That postpones real change until 2013. Worse still for Brussels, Nice excludes Britain's no-go areas of majority voting on indirect taxes in the single market and social security measures to facilitate the free movement of people. Jacques Chirac, who had repeated spats with Mr Prodi, held firm on trade policy, agreeing to drop his veto in new areas but excepting France's film and audio-visual industry to protect it from Hollywood and the global competition. Pascal Lamy, the trade commissioner, thus failed to see the union equipped with a single position for key negotiations with the World Trade Organisation. Small countries will regret the outcome: true, they held on to their commissioner, but in a battle whose terms were dictated by the big three states, they allowed themselves to be picked off. Members of the European Parliament were unhappy too as agreement to raise the previous threshold of MEPs to a record 740 reinforced the impression that it is little more than a consolation prize. Parliament has no power to throw out EU treaties, but Italy and Belgium have signalled that they will listen to its views when ratification comes round. Elmar Brok, a leading Christian Democrat, was scathing about the Riviera endgame: \"It will be more difficult to get a majority and makes procedure more difficult,\" he concluded grimly. \"The whole system becomes more and more complicated. I cannot see how citizens can understand it.\" Related special reports IMF and World Bank summit in Prague 2000 World Trade Organisation summit 1999 May2K demonstrations Debt relief Economic and monetary union European commission European parliament Interactive guide How the European nations relate to each other Useful links Updates from protesters - Indymedia Press release: Nice summit - EU",

      "bodyText": "Iraq threw down a new challenge to the United Nations yesterday by announcing that anyone who wants to buy its oil will have to pay a 40-cent surcharge on each barrel directly into an Iraqi bank account. Earlier in the day, however, Iraq had written to the UN, agreeing to its terms for the next phase of the oil-for-food programme. In the letter the foreign minister, Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf, said Iraq was accepting the terms \"so that our behaviour is not seen as negative and to expose further those with bad intentions\". But oil supplies did not resume as expected yesterday. Iraqi sources at first attributed this to bad weather in the Gulf and a lack of tankers at Ceyhan, Iraq's outlet on the Turkish coast. Iraq cut off its exports - about 5% of the world's total - on December 1 after UN overseers rejected Baghdad's pro posal to charge less than the market price. By reducing its official prices, Iraq had hoped to be able to levy a 50-cent-a-barrel surcharge on customers, payable to an account outside the UN's control. This would have diverted about $420m (\u00a3290m) a year from the oil-for-food programme into the pockets of the Saddam Hussein regime. When Iraq accepted the UN's terms yesterday, dealers initially assumed that it had abandoned the surcharge plan - only to see it return at 40 cents rather that 50. \"No way are we going to be turning a blind eye to this,\" a diplomat at the UN in New York said last night. In London, the Foreign Office said it regarded the surcharge as illegal and expected customers would refuse to pay it. \"We are not unduly concerned, because the International Energy Agency has said recent developments should not be exaggerated and major oil-producing countries have declared their readiness to meet any serious international oil shortages,\" a spokesman said. Even so, the continued stoppage helped push North Sea oil prices up 82 cents to $27.40 (\u00a319) after a $6.50 slump during the past two weeks. Iraq is also seeking to divert \u20ac1bn (\u00a3610m) from the oil-for-food programme during the next 12 months to support the Palestinians in their conflict with Israel. The UN's position is that revenue from the programme should be used to feed the Iraqi people and compensate victims of the 1990 invasion of Kuwait, not to support the Palestinians. To allow payments to Palestinians through the oil-for-food programme would require a special security council resolution, a Foreign Office spokesman said last night. In the absence of that, Iraq may try to allocate part of the surcharge for this purpose - in effect imposing a \"Palestine tax\" on oil companies.",

Darren Protheroe, 22, unemployed, from Swansea, sent photographs of himself to the head of Swansea CID. Protheroe stole the cash after threatening staff with a starter pistol and handcuffing them to a safe in July. The next day he flew to Spain with his girlfriend for a holiday and spent two months spending the money he had stolen. He could not resist taunting police with a series of snaps showing him living the high life. In one, he positioned \u00a34,000 of cash and jewellery on a bed with a note on the back saying \"Is this enough evidence for you?\" On the back of another picture, showing him partying with a group of friends, he wrote: \"I'm a naughty boy, a 100% outlaw. I'm one of a kind - unstoppable.\" The photos were taken from various holiday resorts. Protheroe was arrested when he ran out of money and returned to Swansea to live in a homeless hostel called the Lodge. When police arrested him in September he could not resist one last taunt and asked them why it had taken so long to catch him. Swansea crown court heard that Protheroe hid in a cupboard of the CK's supermarket at Penclawdd, near Swansea, until the shop closed. He waited until two female staff went upstairs to count the takings before telling two 16-year-old male employees he would shoot them in the legs if they did not do what he said. After forcing them to lay face down on the floor he ran upstairs and demanded the two women hand over the weekend's takings. He handcuffed them to the office safe. His lawyer Elwen Evans called taunting the police \"immature bravado\". Judge Huw Williams said: \"It is your youth and insecurity which drives you to compulsory showing off.

Last week, they gathered at a special \"animals session\" of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites, pronounced \"sightease\"). High on their list were several types of a fish called sturgeon - at risk because, when carefully salted, the females' unfertilised eggs become caviar, a top luxury food. </p> <p>In recent years, an international business in smuggled caviar has developed. This has encouraged illegal over-fishing in and around the Caspian Sea (to the north of Iran) where 90% of the world's caviar comes from. Stocks of sturgeon in this region have fallen so much that some experts think they will die out there in as little as three years. But deciding what to do about the problem has not been easy. </p> <p>There are 155 countries signed up to Cites. It is one of the largest conservation agreements in existence. Under its rules, particularly rare wild plants and animals such as apes and tigers can get Appendix I registration. This bans all international trade in them. Since 1997, sturgeon products have been in Appendix II. This means someone wanting to export a Caspian sturgeon (or its caviar) has to get a special permit from the country where it was caught. There are five countries involved - Iran and four states created by the collapse of the Soviet Union (Russia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan). They set limits (quotas) on the amount of sturgeon that can be caught and processed within their borders. </p> <p>It would help if all these countries' quotas could be trusted but they are very doubtful, since they only refer to sturgeon products meant for legal export. Fish caught and eaten locally are not part of the calculation. It is estimated, for example, that Russians get through between three and five times more sturgeon than the authorities allow to go abroad. </p> <p>Also, the quotas do not stop the illegal caviar production and smuggling controlled by powerful criminal gangs. Since 1998, 1,300 kilos of unlicensed caviar imports have been seized by UK customs alone. Perhaps the only proper solution is a recommendation from the Cites animal committee that sturgeon receive Appendix I status. </p> <p>According to the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) an Appendix I listing only makes sense if the governments of the countries around the Caspian do everything they can to protect sturgeon stocks and clamp down on criminals. For example, the so-called caviar pirates often use fine mesh nets that cover hundreds of kilometres of sea and result in the destruction of many immature fish. </p> <p>It can take a female Beluga sturgeon 25 years to produce her first eggs. Other dangers faced by the Caspian sturgeon that need tackling include pollution from the region's industries and dams that prevent the fish reaching their up-river egg-laying sites (spawning grounds). </p> <p>But does it really matter if these creatures vanish? Yes, say scientists. Sturgeon have been swimming in the seas for over 250m years and as the world's largest freshwater fish - some live for 150 years and reach six metres in length - they have an important part to play in their biological environment (ecosystem). Yes, say the legal fishermen who have been earning a living from Caspian sturgeon for centuries. It takes 15 years' training to grasp the proper caviar-making process - one explanation for its rarity and expense. Whole communities that depend on this ancient trade will vanish if the fish goes. </p> <p>Sadly, Caspian sturgeon have much in common with other endangered species. Their rarity only adds to their value, making them attractive to illegal hunters often driven by extreme poverty. Also, their survival depends on countries in which poorly funded local police forces are vulnerable to bribes and death threats and lack the equipment needed to protect animal species. </p> <p>Meanwhile, for those rich enough to have developed a taste for the stuff, this Christmas a London store is selling a kilo of the rarest caviar for \u00a33,950.

Nor, I discovered, had anyone else.

Never mind, I'll help. </p> <p>How about the creation of entertaining, thought-provoking, sophisticated artistic sales messages? One could go on, but even the industry's most enthusiastic advocates would have to concede that advertising agencies don't exactly have the best reputation when it comes to training their staff. Indeed many agencies seem to make a virtue of not training their staff.. </p> <p>So when you hear of an agency that spends more on training its staff than on finding new business and which had the idea of lifelong learning written into its core ethos long before it was even a twinkle in the DfEE's mind, then you tend to take notice. </p> <p>St Luke's was formed five years ago after the London office of the American agency Chiat/Day was about to be acquired by another agency, TBWA. Rather than be subsumed into the new business, Andy Law, Chiat/Day's managing director, and 34 other members of staff left to form their own agency. </p> <p>\"We wanted to create a company that put human capital to the fore,\" says Law, St Luke's chairman. \"Bosses of traditional companies see people as overheads who can be got rid of; we see people as our main asset - an asset that will appreciate in value over time.

That's the prejudices taken care of. Now free your mind and try and come up with something a little more positive. You can't? Never mind, I'll help. How about the creation of entertaining, thought-provoking, sophisticated artistic sales messages? One could go on, but even the industry's most enthusiastic advocates would have to concede that advertising agencies don't exactly have the best reputation when it comes to training their staff. Indeed many agencies seem to make a virtue of not training their staff.. So when you hear of an agency that spends more on training its staff than on finding new business and which had the idea of lifelong learning written into its core ethos long before it was even a twinkle in the DfEE's mind, then you tend to take notice. St Luke's was formed five years ago after the London office of the American agency Chiat/Day was about to be acquired by another agency, TBWA. Rather than be subsumed into the new business, Andy Law, Chiat/Day's managing director, and 34 other members of staff left to form their own agency. \"We wanted to create a company that put human capital to the fore,\" says Law, St Luke's chairman. \"Bosses of traditional companies see people as overheads who can be got rid of; we see people as our main asset - an asset that will appreciate in value over time. In the knowledge economy, the means of production is in the minds of people. In the business world there is an ongoing war for human talent and we wanted an environment where people would want to stay and work.\" If this sounds like a curious mix of Socialist Worker and adspeak, then check out the results.

It was Natfhe which alerted the world to many of the problems in colleges when the Further Education Funding Council ran things. \"If you don't have the voice of the practitioners in there, they won't know how the money is being spent or misspent.\"",

Academic institutions, increasingly dependent on private income, will become even more attractive targets for tobacco sponsorship after government moves towards a tobacco advertising ban, confirmed in the Queen's speech last week. </p> <p>Newcastle's decision represents a dramatic turnaround from events only three years ago. The university was itself the centre of a controversy over tobacco funding, when a senior Medical Research Council official was sacked after expressing reservations over an MRC research project at Newcastle, jointly funded with tobacco companies. (The project eventually failed to identify any positive health benefits from smoking for Alzheimer's sufferers.) </p> <p>Charities such as the Wellcome Trust and Cancer Research Campaign now say they will withdraw grants from academics also supported by tobacco money, due to the overwhelming evidence that active and passive smoking cause major diseases. But the MRC, the government's central funding agency for medical research, rejects that stance. </p> <p>Newcastle University now adopts its own ethical policy, which states that it will not accept sponsorship where either the motives of the sponsor are not in line with the university's aims, or where the suppression of academic results is likely to lead to \"substantial ethical difficulties\". </p> <p>Last week the university said: \"It is in the highest degree unlikely that the university would accept sponsorship from any company engaged in the manufacture of tobacco products, given that it would be extremely difficult to believe that the motives of such companies did not include the increase in the sales of their products, which are known to be both addictive and extremely hazardous to health.\" </p> <p>The university turned down a substantial grant proposal from a tobacco company on the basis of its guidelines. The University of Oxford, which has received no donations from tobacco companies, also says it would not accept funding if it were judged to be \"benefiting the tobacco company or encouraging smoking\". </p> <p>All this appears to contrast starkly with attitudes at Cambridge which, like Nottingham, sparked off controversy four years ago after accepting tobacco money.

A study by the Wellcome Trust in 1997 revealed that two charitable trusts established by tobacco companies had poured more than \u00a310m into UK academic coffers.

It definitely disciplines your lifestyle,\" he says. </p> <p>However, the third-year medic admits that Ramadan does make studying that much more demanding, as he has to get up earlier - usually around 5am - to have a pre-dawn meal (sehri), which is a religious requirement for all those intending to fast during the day. </p> <p>Also, much of his evening time, which he would normally devote to revision and completing course work, is taken up by lengthy Ramadan prayers which are also obligatory. </p> <p>But the devout Muslim does not have any complaints, even though he is necessarily having to work much harder than his non-Muslims peers. His only regret, he says, is that his whole university work is actually disrupting his Ramadan devotions. \"During Ramadan, you want to worship more, read the Koran more. I feel my study disrupts Ramadan, which is about remembrance of God.\" </p> <p>For those Muslim students not as disciplined as Rasheed, Ramadan is a testing time. \"Ramadan has increased the stress on me,\" admits Mohammed Shafiq, who is reading economics. \"At the moment I'm finding it OK, but my deadlines are due. The fasting and the getting up early in the morning makes me tired throughout the day.\" </p> <p>Shafiq, 20, who says he is a \"middle-of-the-road Muslim\", has all the stress of being a final-year student in a difficult discipline. He admits his time-management is somewhat lacking, which doesn't help when both religion and academia are demanding so much simultaneously. </p> <p>Not only is the workload great but there is also the stress of filling up lengthy job application forms, all of which must be sent in before the end of the month. </p> <p>For him Ramadan has come at a bad time. He says it is a \"double dose of exams\" for him this year. \"First of all, Ramadan is a sort of an exam. It's a test of one's faith.

      "body": "<p>\"Play in any form has been stopped in schools because there has been such a great emphasis on literacy and numeracy. This has taken over our lives and play has lost its place in school.\" So said one headteacher in a study published last week which revealed that traditional playground games are disappearing from Britain's schools. </p> <p>Fears of litigation - a recent poll showed that 57% of parents would seek compensation if their child were injured at school - and of Ofsted snootiness over safety and \"non-educational\" pursuits have prompted many schools to ban perennial favourites such as conkers (an offensive weapon) and British Bulldog (too dangerous), according to the study by Sarah Thomson of Keele University. </p> <p>There's another side to the story, though - a playground in North Wales where children have learned to play in harmony thanks to traditional games such as Sticky Policemen and The Bomb. </p> <p>At Llanddulas primary, the pupils have become expert players of catching and skipping games, helped by a collection of ropes, balls, marbles and stones. That \"the box\", as it is known, and its modest contents have proved so popular is an object lesson in the benefits that flow from taking playtime seriously. </p> <p>\"Until the spring of 1999 our small play area, no bigger than a netball court, was home to 110 children for two outdoor sessions a day,\" says deputy head Colin Lavelle. \"The children passed the time trying to wrestle, imitate violent cartoons or run around the small playground at top speed - and collisions were inevitable.\" </p> <p>At that time, year 6 were busy surfing the net in their IT lessons. One of their searches took them to an Irish school site where they found the rules for traditional children's games. \"We decided to test them out for ourselves,\" explains Lavelle. \"Those the class liked received a full review, including ratings for difficulty and enjoyment. I decided to print off and laminate the reviews into game cards. And as some of them required balls and ropes, the box was born. </p> <p>\"A few simple rules followed. No one could be excluded if they wanted to take part in an activity and balls were to be thrown and not kicked. The class also appointed two of their number to be the box monitors. And that was it - they were off.\" </p> <p>A year on and playground behaviour has changed radically. Nothing has been done to alter the environment. It remains a standard flat area of tarmac and yet the atmosphere is pleasantly different. None is more appreciative of this than the children themselves. </p> <p>\"I just used to stay with the girls,\" says Kim Jasper, 10. \"The boys were rough and it was boring just sitting around - we never played anything. Now it's fun.\" Her classmate Yasmin Morgan-Griffiths is also impressed by the transformation. \"It was a surprise when the box came - I love the skipping and it's good to learn new games.\" Luke McKenna, nine, has recently arrived at Llanddulas. Playtime at his Solihull primary did not compare well. \"My old playground was giant - apart from 'Tig' there was not much going on.\" </p> <p>An all too common problem, according to Thomson's survey of 1,000 children in Staffordshire, Shropshire and Lancashire. \"All the schools I visited saw playtime as a time that could not be left entirely to the children's wishes,\" she explains. \"It seemed that many of the children's attempts to play were extinguished by the same supervising adults who complained that children 'did not play'.\" </p> <p>According to consultant Marc Armitage, it is all too easy for teachers to miss the elaborate games that are going on. \"Before anything is changed in a playground it is essential to carry out a thorough audit of what is really happening. Not to do so is to risk displacing existing activities.\" </p> <p>Tim Gill, director of the Children's Play Council, agrees. \"Far too often schools cope with playground problems by clamping down. School playgrounds may look like chaotic places, but playtime is one of the few oases in children's lives when they can just be themselves.\" </p> <p>Education consultant Wendy Titman points out that playtime constitutes a kind of \"informal curriculum\" and needs as much sensitive nurturing as the subjects taught formally indoors. \"Sadly, it receives less and less emphasis,\" she says. </p> <p>\"The government is very muddled here,\" adds Ken Davies of charity Learning Through Landscapes. \"It wants the next generation to be healthy and happy but all the emphasis on the classroom means it's loading things in the opposite direction.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile at Llanddulas, the stimulation continues. \"We have entered an interesting stage,\" says Lavelle. \"For the most part, the pupils that selected the box activities have left the school and now the games are being adapted - the names and rules are altering.\" </p> <p>For Luke McKenna, the spirit of independence is even more advanced. \"To be honest,\" he says, \"I never play the games the teachers teach us - I invent my own.\" </p> <p><strong>Useful link</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.llanddulas.conwy.sch.uk/Directory.htm\">Llandulas' playground games directory</a></p> <p><strong>The games people play</strong></p> <p><strong> The Bomb</strong> <br><strong>Players: </strong> 5+ <br><strong> Equipment: </strong> tennis ball. <br><strong> Rules: </strong> Everyone stands in a circle. One person throws the ball to someone else (at chest height so it is easy to catch). As soon as the ball leaves the first person's hands, the group starts a countdown - ten, nine, etc. The idea is to get rid of the ball as quickly as possible by throwing it to another person. When the countdown reaches one, the next shout is \"bomb\" - and the person left holding the ball is out. If \"bomb\" is shouted when the ball is in mid-air, the last person to touch the ball is out. The winner is the last person in. </p> <p><strong> Fish </strong><br><strong>Players: </strong> Three teams and an extra person, ie 7, 10, 13, 16 or 19 people. <br><strong> Equipment: </strong> A large square space (3m by 3m or more), with corners marked with posts or jumpers. <br><strong> Rules: </strong> Children arrange themselves into three teams and each team stands in one of the corners, leaving one corner empty. One person stands in the middle of the square. He or she is \"It\". </p> <p>Each of the teams is named after a fish. The person who is \"It\" calls one of the fish names and the people from that team must rush to the empty corner without being touched by whoever is \"It\". They must not run outside the box. If someone is tagged they are \"out\" for the rest of the game. The winner is the last person surviving. They win the game for their team. </p> <p><strong> Black Magic </strong><br><strong>Players: </strong> 4+ <br><strong> Equipment: </strong> None <br><strong> Rules: </strong> Someone is \"on\". The others sit in a line facing in one direction and stretch their hands out in front of them. The person who is \"on\" runs down the line, touching each hand and saying with each touch \"black, black, black\". </p> <p>Whenever they want to, they say \"magic\". As soon as they say it, they must run as fast as possible away from the line, and the person whose hand was touched last must leap up and say \"stop\". The \"on\" person must freeze. The person who shouted \"stop\" then adds up the number of letters in their first name and surname. That is the number of \"pigeon\" steps (toe-to-heel) they can make (Ann Smith = eight steps). </p> <p>If the number of steps takes them within touching distance of the person who is \"on\", they swap places. The game can go on until the crack of doom or the bell for lessons, whichever comes sooner.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\"Play in any form has been stopped in schools because there has been such a great emphasis on literacy and numeracy. This has taken over our lives and play has lost its place in school.\" So said one headteacher in a study published last week which revealed that traditional playground games are disappearing from Britain's schools. Fears of litigation - a recent poll showed that 57% of parents would seek compensation if their child were injured at school - and of Ofsted snootiness over safety and \"non-educational\" pursuits have prompted many schools to ban perennial favourites such as conkers (an offensive weapon) and British Bulldog (too dangerous), according to the study by Sarah Thomson of Keele University. There's another side to the story, though - a playground in North Wales where children have learned to play in harmony thanks to traditional games such as Sticky Policemen and The Bomb. At Llanddulas primary, the pupils have become expert players of catching and skipping games, helped by a collection of ropes, balls, marbles and stones. That \"the box\", as it is known, and its modest contents have proved so popular is an object lesson in the benefits that flow from taking playtime seriously. \"Until the spring of 1999 our small play area, no bigger than a netball court, was home to 110 children for two outdoor sessions a day,\" says deputy head Colin Lavelle. \"The children passed the time trying to wrestle, imitate violent cartoons or run around the small playground at top speed - and collisions were inevitable.\" At that time, year 6 were busy surfing the net in their IT lessons. One of their searches took them to an Irish school site where they found the rules for traditional children's games. \"We decided to test them out for ourselves,\" explains Lavelle. \"Those the class liked received a full review, including ratings for difficulty and enjoyment. I decided to print off and laminate the reviews into game cards. And as some of them required balls and ropes, the box was born. \"A few simple rules followed. No one could be excluded if they wanted to take part in an activity and balls were to be thrown and not kicked. The class also appointed two of their number to be the box monitors. And that was it - they were off.\" A year on and playground behaviour has changed radically. Nothing has been done to alter the environment. It remains a standard flat area of tarmac and yet the atmosphere is pleasantly different. None is more appreciative of this than the children themselves. \"I just used to stay with the girls,\" says Kim Jasper, 10. \"The boys were rough and it was boring just sitting around - we never played anything. Now it's fun.\" Her classmate Yasmin Morgan-Griffiths is also impressed by the transformation. \"It was a surprise when the box came - I love the skipping and it's good to learn new games.\" Luke McKenna, nine, has recently arrived at Llanddulas. Playtime at his Solihull primary did not compare well. \"My old playground was giant - apart from 'Tig' there was not much going on.\" An all too common problem, according to Thomson's survey of 1,000 children in Staffordshire, Shropshire and Lancashire. \"All the schools I visited saw playtime as a time that could not be left entirely to the children's wishes,\" she explains. \"It seemed that many of the children's attempts to play were extinguished by the same supervising adults who complained that children 'did not play'.\" According to consultant Marc Armitage, it is all too easy for teachers to miss the elaborate games that are going on. \"Before anything is changed in a playground it is essential to carry out a thorough audit of what is really happening. Not to do so is to risk displacing existing activities.\" Tim Gill, director of the Children's Play Council, agrees. \"Far too often schools cope with playground problems by clamping down. School playgrounds may look like chaotic places, but playtime is one of the few oases in children's lives when they can just be themselves.\" Education consultant Wendy Titman points out that playtime constitutes a kind of \"informal curriculum\" and needs as much sensitive nurturing as the subjects taught formally indoors. \"Sadly, it receives less and less emphasis,\" she says. \"The government is very muddled here,\" adds Ken Davies of charity Learning Through Landscapes. \"It wants the next generation to be healthy and happy but all the emphasis on the classroom means it's loading things in the opposite direction.\" Meanwhile at Llanddulas, the stimulation continues. \"We have entered an interesting stage,\" says Lavelle. \"For the most part, the pupils that selected the box activities have left the school and now the games are being adapted - the names and rules are altering.\" For Luke McKenna, the spirit of independence is even more advanced. \"To be honest,\" he says, \"I never play the games the teachers teach us - I invent my own.\" Useful link Llandulas' playground games directory The games people play The Bomb Players: 5+ Equipment: tennis ball. Rules: Everyone stands in a circle. One person throws the ball to someone else (at chest height so it is easy to catch). As soon as the ball leaves the first person's hands, the group starts a countdown - ten, nine, etc. The idea is to get rid of the ball as quickly as possible by throwing it to another person. When the countdown reaches one, the next shout is \"bomb\" - and the person left holding the ball is out. If \"bomb\" is shouted when the ball is in mid-air, the last person to touch the ball is out. The winner is the last person in. Fish Players: Three teams and an extra person, ie 7, 10, 13, 16 or 19 people. Equipment: A large square space (3m by 3m or more), with corners marked with posts or jumpers. Rules: Children arrange themselves into three teams and each team stands in one of the corners, leaving one corner empty. One person stands in the middle of the square. He or she is \"It\". Each of the teams is named after a fish. The person who is \"It\" calls one of the fish names and the people from that team must rush to the empty corner without being touched by whoever is \"It\". They must not run outside the box. If someone is tagged they are \"out\" for the rest of the game. The winner is the last person surviving. They win the game for their team. Black Magic Players: 4+ Equipment: None Rules: Someone is \"on\". The others sit in a line facing in one direction and stretch their hands out in front of them. The person who is \"on\" runs down the line, touching each hand and saying with each touch \"black, black, black\". Whenever they want to, they say \"magic\". As soon as they say it, they must run as fast as possible away from the line, and the person whose hand was touched last must leap up and say \"stop\". The \"on\" person must freeze. The person who shouted \"stop\" then adds up the number of letters in their first name and surname. That is the number of \"pigeon\" steps (toe-to-heel) they can make (Ann Smith = eight steps). If the number of steps takes them within touching distance of the person who is \"on\", they swap places. The game can go on until the crack of doom or the bell for lessons, whichever comes sooner.",

      "body": "<p>The end of the 20th century has left the specialist study of modern languages in the UK in crisis. Universities are cutting single honours degrees, whole departments are closing and the study of some languages may cease altogether. This is because the supply of A-level students from schools and colleges has gone into sharp decline. </p> <p>In the late 1980s and early 90s, there had been an upswing in language learning at school and university. A language was made a compulsory core subject in the national curriculum. </p> <p>Around 1992 that began to change. In French and German, in languages overall, A-level numbers have declined relentlessly. The only exception is Spanish, but not enough to compensate for the overall decline. </p> <p>The fault line in language learning is not the passage from school to university, it is the passage from year 11 to 12 from GCSE to the first year of A-level, from secondary school to sixth form/further education college. </p> <p>After GCSE, the point in the education system where pupils can choose whether to do a language, more and more have opted not to. Why is this? </p> <p>There are many reasons, some based on misinformation and misunderstanding. The rise of English as an international language, the growing hostility in the UK to the European Union have something to do with it. There are also perceptions among school pupils that languages are more difficult than most other subjects, or that they will improve their career prospects if they do \"vocational\" subjects, more of which are now available at A-level. </p> <p>While brighter pupils have been doing eight to 12 GCSEs, they have only been doing two to four A-levels. There has been a suspicion that pupils were having to drop subjects they were ready and able to do. </p> <p>In October 1998, to test if frustrated would-be linguists existed in sixth forms, Bangor University's modern languages department carried out a survey in 110 schools and colleges across the country. It addressed 2,200 year 12 pupils who had got A*, A or B in a GCSE language but were not doing that language at A-level. </p> <p>It found that a substantial proportion, given the chance to do another A-level, would have chosen a language: this would have been enough to raise by as much as 50% the number of A-level language students in their institutions. </p> <p>In the academic session 2000-2001 there is a chance to make this happen. Curriculum 2000, designed to broaden the range of subjects and skills pursued in the sixth form, divides the old-style, two-year A-level into two separate awards: AS-level taken in the lower sixth, and A2-level taken at the end of the upper sixth. Pupils are being encouraged to do an extra subject at AS-level. The question is how many have made that extra AS-level subject a language they have done at GCSE? And how many will continue it to A2-level? </p> <p>The final AS-level entry numbers will not be available until spring 2001, but knowing how things are shaping up could help teachers and pupils to up their efforts this winter. </p> <p>So Bangor has done a provisional survey of UK schools and colleges. With 112 returns analysed to date, and caveats about the size of that sample, the results are encouraging: </p> <p>\u0095 Numbers for the new style AS-level this year (2000-2001) look like being dramatically up on those for the old- style A-level + AS last year (1999-2000) - 74% of schools report an increase; </p> <p>\u0095 French is up 35%, Spanish 31%, German 15%; </p> <p>\u0095 All languages together are up 30%; </p> <p>\u0095 Minor languages such as Italian and Russian have increased, though from low base lines; </p> <p>\u0095 Numbers doing two languages are up by 44%; </p> <p>\u0095 Teachers' predictions for the new A2 over the old A-level are optimistic: Spanish to go up 28%, German 17%, French 13%. </p> <p>Curriculum 2000 holds enormous potential for modern languages. For the short term, it is important that this message of good cheer goes out to sixth form language teachers, so as to demonstrate the high stakes we are playing for this year. </p> <p>Making a success of AS-level in terms of numbers and results in its first year is vital. It will create a platform on which to build a bridge to A2-level next year and from there on to university. In the longer term, universities can play their part in realising the potential of these new exams. </p> <p>If the schools in the Bangor survey are typical, then the new AS-levels are on the brink of turning round dramatically the fortunes of specialist language learning in sixth forms and universities. By pulling together, language teachers at secondary, further education and higher education levels can improve the odds on the dawn of the 21st century being a new dawn for languages in the UK. </p> <p>\u0095 Meanwhile, the position in universities has deteriorated with a further drop in students starting single honours language degrees this autumn (figures are being compiled by the funding councils), writes <strong>Donald MacLeod</strong>. </p> <p>Specialists fear a new round of cutbacks will leave universities unable to cope if and when the number of applicants increases. Hilary Footitt, chair of the University Council of Modern Languages (UCML), urged vice-chancellors to take a longer-term view of the prospects of their languages departments because numbers were likely to rise. </p> <p>\"If they don't, we may have to run down or close languages departments and then find there is a real national need for specialist linguists, and an increasing number of students wanting to take languages in higher education on the strength of the new curriculum.\" </p> <p>Hull University's ruling council on Friday discussed a radical review of all subjects, including a switch from single honours language degrees to joint degrees like chemistry and German. Minority languages are under particular pressure and staff fear Dutch could be cut at one of only four centres in England (the others are at Cambridge, Sheffield and University College London). A university spokesman said single honours languages had been in decline because fewer students were doing them at A-level but joint degrees were popular. </p> <p>Footitt said the UK needed a strategic approach; otherwise decisions by individual universities would decimate language provision. \"With all the talk of the Nice summit, it's about time that we looked at what our EU partners are doing, and tried to see ways in which UK cooperation with specific EU countries could help us to preserve and develop our language base.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Keith Marshall is from the School of Modern Languages, University of Wales, Bangor. Information on UCML can be obtained <a href=\"http://www.ucml.org.uk\">here</a>.</p> <p><strong>What can universities do?</strong></p> <p>To maximise numbers doing not only AS-level but A2-level, university and college language departments can reach out to pupils in the lower sixth and earlier years, helping teachers make the case for modern languages. </p> <p>Admissions officers, across all academic disciplines, can encourage pupils in schools to do languages to AS-level by accepting unreservedly the UCAS points applicants gain from them. Language departments can provide first-year courses catering for students arriving with the new AS-level language skills (between GCSE and full A-level/A2-level). </p> <p>More degrees can be constructed with other subjects, which allow for the study of languages to a level below full honours standard.</p> <p><strong>Fall and rise of language learning</strong></p> <p><strong> Change in exam entries for A-level or A-level equivalents in modern languages 1993-2002*</strong><strong> (*predicted)</strong> </p> <p><strong>Old-style A-level and AS-level</strong></p> <p><strong>Subject</strong> | 1993 | <strong>1999</strong> | Change 1993-1999</p> <p><strong>French</strong> 33,037 <strong>22,902</strong> -10,135 (- 31%)</p> <p><strong>German</strong> 12,072 <strong>10,317</strong> -1,755 (-15%)</p> <p><strong>Spanish </strong> 5,329 <strong>6,399</strong> +1,070 (+20%) </p> <p><strong>New-style A-level (1) and AS-level</strong></p> <p><strong>Subject</strong> | AS Change 1999-2000 | <strong>A2 (2) change 1999-2002</strong></p> <p><strong>French</strong> +35% <strong>+13%</strong> </p> <p><strong>German</strong> +15% <strong>+17%</strong> </p> <p><strong>Spanish</strong> +31% <strong>+28%</strong> </p> <p><strong> Notes</strong><br><strong> 1 </strong> Percentage changes (actual) in take-up for new-style AS in schools surveyed 1999/2000-2000/2001,<strong> 2 </strong>Percentage changes (predicted) in take-up for new-style A2 in schools surveyed 1999/2000-2001/2002 <br><strong> Source: </strong> Marshall</p>",

In October 1998, to test if frustrated would-be linguists existed in sixth forms, Bangor University's modern languages department carried out a survey in 110 schools and colleges across the country. It addressed 2,200 year 12 pupils who had got A*, A or B in a GCSE language but were not doing that language at A-level. It found that a substantial proportion, given the chance to do another A-level, would have chosen a language: this would have been enough to raise by as much as 50% the number of A-level language students in their institutions. In the academic session 2000-2001 there is a chance to make this happen. Curriculum 2000, designed to broaden the range of subjects and skills pursued in the sixth form, divides the old-style, two-year A-level into two separate awards: AS-level taken in the lower sixth, and A2-level taken at the end of the upper sixth. Pupils are being encouraged to do an extra subject at AS-level. The question is how many have made that extra AS-level subject a language they have done at GCSE? And how many will continue it to A2-level? The final AS-level entry numbers will not be available until spring 2001, but knowing how things are shaping up could help teachers and pupils to up their efforts this winter. So Bangor has done a provisional survey of UK schools and colleges. With 112 returns analysed to date, and caveats about the size of that sample, the results are encouraging: \u0095 Numbers for the new style AS-level this year (2000-2001) look like being dramatically up on those for the old- style A-level + AS last year (1999-2000) - 74% of schools report an increase; \u0095 French is up 35%, Spanish 31%, German 15%; \u0095 All languages together are up 30%; \u0095 Minor languages such as Italian and Russian have increased, though from low base lines; \u0095 Numbers doing two languages are up by 44%; \u0095 Teachers' predictions for the new A2 over the old A-level are optimistic: Spanish to go up 28%, German 17%, French 13%. Curriculum 2000 holds enormous potential for modern languages. For the short term, it is important that this message of good cheer goes out to sixth form language teachers, so as to demonstrate the high stakes we are playing for this year. Making a success of AS-level in terms of numbers and results in its first year is vital. It will create a platform on which to build a bridge to A2-level next year and from there on to university. In the longer term, universities can play their part in realising the potential of these new exams. If the schools in the Bangor survey are typical, then the new AS-levels are on the brink of turning round dramatically the fortunes of specialist language learning in sixth forms and universities. By pulling together, language teachers at secondary, further education and higher education levels can improve the odds on the dawn of the 21st century being a new dawn for languages in the UK. \u0095 Meanwhile, the position in universities has deteriorated with a further drop in students starting single honours language degrees this autumn (figures are being compiled by the funding councils), writes Donald MacLeod. Specialists fear a new round of cutbacks will leave universities unable to cope if and when the number of applicants increases. Hilary Footitt, chair of the University Council of Modern Languages (UCML), urged vice-chancellors to take a longer-term view of the prospects of their languages departments because numbers were likely to rise. \"If they don't, we may have to run down or close languages departments and then find there is a real national need for specialist linguists, and an increasing number of students wanting to take languages in higher education on the strength of the new curriculum.\" Hull University's ruling council on Friday discussed a radical review of all subjects, including a switch from single honours language degrees to joint degrees like chemistry and German. Minority languages are under particular pressure and staff fear Dutch could be cut at one of only four centres in England (the others are at Cambridge, Sheffield and University College London). A university spokesman said single honours languages had been in decline because fewer students were doing them at A-level but joint degrees were popular. Footitt said the UK needed a strategic approach; otherwise decisions by individual universities would decimate language provision. \"With all the talk of the Nice summit, it's about time that we looked at what our EU partners are doing, and tried to see ways in which UK cooperation with specific EU countries could help us to preserve and develop our language base.\" \u0095 Keith Marshall is from the School of Modern Languages, University of Wales, Bangor. Information on UCML can be obtained here. What can universities do? To maximise numbers doing not only AS-level but A2-level, university and college language departments can reach out to pupils in the lower sixth and earlier years, helping teachers make the case for modern languages. Admissions officers, across all academic disciplines, can encourage pupils in schools to do languages to AS-level by accepting unreservedly the UCAS points applicants gain from them. Language departments can provide first-year courses catering for students arriving with the new AS-level language skills (between GCSE and full A-level/A2-level). More degrees can be constructed with other subjects, which allow for the study of languages to a level below full honours standard.

Lloyds has 2,200 branches and already, in more than 400 cases, two are within half a mile of each other - a legacy of TSB, where primary legislation was required before true integration could happen. </p> <p>Great prospective news for shareholders, perhaps. But what about customers? This is a deal which will affect all of us who bank - whether with Lloyds or Abbey or anyone else. </p> <p>By attempting to buy Abbey, Lloyds is effectively looking to take out one of its prime competitors. More importantly, it is acting now to prevent the creation of a \"fifth force\" in retail banking by spoiling the planned merger between Abbey and Bank of Scotland. </p> <p>While the stats-bending department at Lloyds may be able to cite market shares that fail to match levels at which Royal Bank of Scotland was allowed to snap up NatWest, the circumstances are markedly different. </p> <p>What should be foremost in the mind of the competition authorities which will decide this battle (forget about the City institutions here - the casting vote is closer to Whitehall) is that Abbey and BoS combined is a real danger to Lloyds. Even on its own, Abbey has been making all the noise about boosting its share of current accounts (less than 5%, against Lloyds' 25%) and its share of business accounts (almost non-existent at present). </p> <p>This is competition in the clearest sense of the word. It is an unavoidable fact that, by allowing Abbey to join the Black Horse stable, it will reduce competition. This bid, if it happens, will destroy consumer value. </p> <p><strong> Shire audacity </strong><br> </p> <p> From his base in a sleepy Andover farmhouse, Shire's chief executive, Rolf Stahel, has masterminded another international coup. </p> <p>This time, Shire has swooped on a Canadian drugs firm that is making profits of $110m a year at an operating margin of nearly 60%. </p> <p>BioChem Pharma is able to generate such earnings because it has struck gold with two key products: Epivir for HIV and Zeffix for hepatitis B. The company is one of the rare profitable graduates from the biotechnology industry, which Mr Stahel has dismissed as a game of \"molecular roulette\". </p> <p>Critics yesterday queried whether Shire ought to be issuing $4bn of shares to buy a company with little of obvious value in the way of imminent product launches. Mr Stahel's answer is that steady cash from Epivir and Zeffix will reduce Shire's dependence on its psychiatric portfolio. He also believes BioChem's vaccine portfolio might contain a hidden \"jewel\", yielding results in the long term. </p> <p>Mr Stahel's record of turning plodding donkeys into stallions is impressive - last year's merger with Roberts proved successful, despite attracting a similar reaction to yesterday's raspberry from the stock market. </p> <p>Yesterday's deal might look chunky but it is difficult to attach a fair value to BioChem, because it outsources all of its marketing and distribution. </p> <p>Shire has been the success story of the year for Britain's pharmaceuticals industry. The government should take note of the firm's warning that, unless drugs get friendlier treatment, it will follow Glaxo SmithKline by moving its nerve centre to North America. </p> <p><strong> No failing grace </strong><br> </p> <p> At the age of 58, David Jones, chief executive of National Grid, has ousted himself. Roger Unwin, head of UK and Europe, takes over next March - a year before Mr Jones' scheduled retirement. </p> <p>This man floated the business five years ago at \u00a33.4bn and has watched its value grow to \u00a39bn. A series of US acquisitions has taken Grid into the American top 10 of power firms; it was never going to be just another low-growth utility whose returns were set by the British regulator. Along the way, the extraordinary Energis telephone venture was spun off, leaving Grid with a 35% stake in a business worth \u00a38.5bn. </p> <p>So what does Mr Jones walk away with? Er, his pension - and that is it. No song and dance, no big kiss-off cheque. </p> <p>He didn't fail, you see. He just did an exceptionally good job.</p>",

By attempting to buy Abbey, Lloyds is effectively looking to take out one of its prime competitors. More importantly, it is acting now to prevent the creation of a \"fifth force\" in retail banking by spoiling the planned merger between Abbey and Bank of Scotland. While the stats-bending department at Lloyds may be able to cite market shares that fail to match levels at which Royal Bank of Scotland was allowed to snap up NatWest, the circumstances are markedly different. What should be foremost in the mind of the competition authorities which will decide this battle (forget about the City institutions here - the casting vote is closer to Whitehall) is that Abbey and BoS combined is a real danger to Lloyds. Even on its own, Abbey has been making all the noise about boosting its share of current accounts (less than 5%, against Lloyds' 25%) and its share of business accounts (almost non-existent at present). This is competition in the clearest sense of the word. It is an unavoidable fact that, by allowing Abbey to join the Black Horse stable, it will reduce competition. This bid, if it happens, will destroy consumer value. Shire audacity From his base in a sleepy Andover farmhouse, Shire's chief executive, Rolf Stahel, has masterminded another international coup. This time, Shire has swooped on a Canadian drugs firm that is making profits of $110m a year at an operating margin of nearly 60%. BioChem Pharma is able to generate such earnings because it has struck gold with two key products: Epivir for HIV and Zeffix for hepatitis B. The company is one of the rare profitable graduates from the biotechnology industry, which Mr Stahel has dismissed as a game of \"molecular roulette\". Critics yesterday queried whether Shire ought to be issuing $4bn of shares to buy a company with little of obvious value in the way of imminent product launches. Mr Stahel's answer is that steady cash from Epivir and Zeffix will reduce Shire's dependence on its psychiatric portfolio. He also believes BioChem's vaccine portfolio might contain a hidden \"jewel\", yielding results in the long term. Mr Stahel's record of turning plodding donkeys into stallions is impressive - last year's merger with Roberts proved successful, despite attracting a similar reaction to yesterday's raspberry from the stock market. Yesterday's deal might look chunky but it is difficult to attach a fair value to BioChem, because it outsources all of its marketing and distribution. Shire has been the success story of the year for Britain's pharmaceuticals industry. The government should take note of the firm's warning that, unless drugs get friendlier treatment, it will follow Glaxo SmithKline by moving its nerve centre to North America. No failing grace At the age of 58, David Jones, chief executive of National Grid, has ousted himself. Roger Unwin, head of UK and Europe, takes over next March - a year before Mr Jones' scheduled retirement. This man floated the business five years ago at \u00a33.4bn and has watched its value grow to \u00a39bn. A series of US acquisitions has taken Grid into the American top 10 of power firms; it was never going to be just another low-growth utility whose returns were set by the British regulator. Along the way, the extraordinary Energis telephone venture was spun off, leaving Grid with a 35% stake in a business worth \u00a38.5bn. So what does Mr Jones walk away with? Er, his pension - and that is it. No song and dance, no big kiss-off cheque. He didn't fail, you see. He just did an exceptionally good job.",

But when they get rocky and pretentious (Playing with Uranium) or the vocals get beyond Le Bon (Hungry Like a Wolf), it all becomes a very convincing case for living in the here and now, instead of looking back. Duran Duran play the Apollo, Manchester (0161-242 2560) tonight, the NEC Birmingham (0121-780 4133) on Thursday, then tour.",

He played the Beethoven Violin Concerto with Papian conducting,and after the interval took the baton himself in a performance of Mozart's Jupiter Symphony. For all his enthusiasm and exuberance - he twirls around on the podium with balletic grace and tangible glee - that was perhaps an unwise move. He's a plausible conductor, though not a great one, and the symphony took an awfully long time to get going. Much of the time, he aspires to the kind of spaciousness one primarily associates with Klemperer's Mozart, though with little of the latter's emotional depth and resonance. The first movement was sluggish and the Andante dawdled. When we got to the Minuet, however, Vengerov suddenly struck form, shading it towards a waltz and infusing it with an infectious, unashamed Viennese lilt. The finale had a certain magisterial elan, without quite scaling the heights of elation that the greatest interpreters bring to the work. </p> <p>He's better off as a violinist, in short, and his performance of the Beethoven was, in its way, stunning. Rarely, I suspect, has this most noble of concertos been played with such perfection of technique and such lacerating sweetness of tone, its long, rapt phrases seeming alternately to hover and swoop seraphically in the air. Interpretatively he plays safe, refusing, on occasion, to sacrifice beauty of sound for emotional danger. There's no self-conscious showing off, even though the cadenzas - his own - are filthily difficult. The first, a massive triple-stopped variant on the opening movement's second subject, veers closer to Brahms than Beethoven and breaks the mood a bit. The second is an exhilarating cascade of tone. Papian's conducts with violent, emphatic gestures, not always securing a comparable emotional response from the ECO, whose playing was muted on occasion. </p> <p>When it was over, Vengerov returned to the platform clutching a Baroque violin rather than his Strad, and gave us the Adagio from Bach's G Minor Sonata as an encore, probing it rhapsodically rather than opting for a stiff formality of approach.

Yet in Steven Isserlis's and Paavo Jarvi's performance with the London Philharmonic - part of the orchestra's Sleeping Beauties festival, curated by Isserlis himself - the trajectory of the whole piece was transformed from showy display to inner communion. </p> <p>Even as early as the radiant, slower theme in the orchestral introduction - magnificently phrased by Nicholas Busch, the LPO's principal horn - it was clear that this interior, nostalgic realm was the true goal of this interpretation. This first movement was all about a conflict between public and private kinds of music: the formal histrionics of the allegro proper opposed to the intimacy of the ravishing, slower melody. </p> <p>Isserlis's extraordinary warmth of tone and lustrous range of colour perfectly matched this glowing interpretation of the movement, culminating in the music's rapturous, major-key coda. But it was the second, slow, movement that signalled a decisive turn inwards, creating a private dialogue between Isserlis and the orchestra. Dvorak himself inverts the priorities of the romantic solo concerto in this slow movement. In the work's only cadenza, he uses the cello not as an instrument of lyrical intensity but as the embodiment of an archetypal, pastoral vision. The cello plays open fifths and simple intervals, and Isserlis turned this apparent simplicity into a heart-stopping, visionary moment. </p> <p>It's a prophetic passage, too, for in the last movement there is a similar epiphany, as the music slows down just as one expects a final peroration. But in Isserlis's performance, this languid music was emphatically conclusive. He projected Dvorak's synthesis of themes from the first and last movements with serene conviction - the only logical ending to this revelatory, thoughtful performance. </p> <p>Brahms's First Serenade was the relative rarity - or \"sleeping beauty\" - of the programme. Although Brahms does not attempt to integrate the grand statements of the opening and closing movements with the simpler charms of the inner dances, the Serenade is a fascinating, transitional work. Jarvi and the LPO relished the pre-echoes of later, mature Brahms - especially the Second Symphony and Second Piano Concerto - and were enthusiastic advocates of the subtleties of the Serenade's menuets and scherzos.</p>",
