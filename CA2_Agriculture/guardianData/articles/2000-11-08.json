      "bodyText": "The centrepiece of the dome's display of diamonds is the De Beers Millennium Star, widely regarded as one of the purest and most beautiful in the world. The 2in long pear-shaped stone, which took three years to cut and polish, was bought in the early 1990s in the former Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of Congo. Five craftsmen worked on it in Europe, America and South Africa, shaping it from one of the biggest diamonds discovered, a stone said to have been dug from a field by a Congolese miner. Rumour has it that he sold it to a de Beers buyer for \u00a3400,000, but the company would not confirm this. On the dome's opening night, a laser was shone through the Millennium Star, throwing shafts of light around the building. The other 11 stones are rare blue diamonds, gathered at the De Beers Premier mine in South Africa - which yields one significant blue stone a year - and set aside for the millennium. The largest and most stunning is the 27-carat Heart of Eternity, which sparkles in an intense blue found rarely in diamonds of its size, which often bear grey flecks of impurity. Some reports claimed the set of 12 spectacular gems was insured for \u00a3150m, and could be worth \u00a3350m, but De Beers would not speak of their value. A spokeswoman described the Millennium Star as virtually priceless because it is so unique. When the collection was unveiled last September, De Beers' chairman, Nicky Oppenheimer, said: \"To be able to unveil not only one diamond but a collection of such rarity that most of us will not see its like again is, I think, the only adequate way to mark the passage of 2,000 years of man's history.\" De Beers provided \u00a32m in sponsorship for the dome, most of which went on security for the collection.",

      "body": "<p>As the polls closed, the American election left behind an undercurrent of bitterness in the Democratic party towards Ralph Nader. The veteran environmentalist, running as a Green candidate, has been denounced in intemperate terms, at best as what New York Times calls an \"ego run amok\", at worst as a spoiler who has betrayed the liberal cause. There are Gore loyalists who have come to hate Nader more than George W Bush, and will never forgive him.</p> <p>It is hard to see the logic of this. For a variety of good reasons, plenty of Democrats already felt betrayed by Gore, as well as by Bill Clinton, and there is something odd about telling them that they had a moral duty to vote for a candidate they dislike and despise. Richard Cohen of the Washington Post was surely right in saying that \"If Al Gore loses any of the eight states where Nader has become a factor, the fault will not be Nader's. It will be Gore's.\" Nader has said the same himself: were the Democrat to lose, it wouldn't be Nader who had taken the election from Gore, \"Al Gore will have taken the election from Al Gore.\"</p> <p>Critics are found denouncing Nader in London as well as Washington and New York, but they don't seem to have thought it through. They can scarcely claim it is inherently wicked for a third party to run at all. Is Nader doing anything different in kind from the disillusioned Labour defectors who created the SDP in 1981 (and sharply affected the 1983 election by winning 11.6% of the vote); or for that matter from the Labour representation committee when it broke free of \"Lib-Lab\" subjection and set up shop 100 years ago this year, six years before it formally became a Labour party destined to supplant the Liberals?</p> <p>Perhaps these traditionalist critics deplore anyone challenging the sclerotic American two-party system. In fact, what's striking about third-party interventions in presidential elections is how rare they have been - and how ineffectual they have been in disrupting that system. Occasionally they have decided the outcome. The strangest case was in 1912 when Theodore Roosevelt bolted from the Republicans, for whom he had won the presidency eight years earlier, to run as a Progressive against President Taft, Roosevelt's own chosen successor when he stepped down after his first term in the White House. That intervention handed the election to the Democrat, Woodrow Wilson, just as, eight years ago, the astonishing 19% of the vote won by Ross Perot handed the election to Clinton.</p> <p>But in other cases, the effect of out side candidates has been more ambiguous. In 1968, the candidature of the racist George Wallace, evidently taking votes on the right, didn't stop Nixon winning. The 1948 election was still more complex. It saw the only genuine four-horse race of the century, with two men bolting from the Democrats under President Harry Truman. Strom Thurmond ran under the banner of States Rights (as Southern segregationists euphemistically had it) and Henry Wallace ran as a Progressive, the same name as Roosevelt's 36 years earlier but a very different kind of party, a leftwing popular front supported by the communists.</p> <p>If anything, that election showed how unpredictable such interventions could be. Coming from Truman's own party, Thurmond and Wallace both looked as if they must damage him, and indeed, right up to election day, almost every politician and pundit expected Truman to be beaten by the Republican, Thomas Dewey. In the event, the two bolters both picked up far from insignificant tallies, Thurmond winning 1.17m votes (and carrying four states), Wallace 1.15m.</p> <p>But Truman won the election, and it seems at least possible that those two may actually have helped him. Thurmond showed that a Democrat could win without the embarassment of the racist \"Solid South\". As for Wallace, by drawing anti-communist fire as the cold war got into its stride, he allowed Truman to denounce Russian aggression and those who would appease it, while visibly moving his campaign to the left on domestic issues, backing labour and attacking business in a way which would terrify Gore. In the same indirect way, Patrick Buchanan's campaign on a xenophobic radical-right platform this year almost certainly helped Bush.</p> <p>In a new book, The Last Campaign: How Harry Truman Won the 1948 Election, the American writer Zachary Karabell suggests something more. Flawed as those two were, Thurmond's campaign stained by racism, Wallace's by Stalinism, they were also authentic populist attempts to break free of the Tweedledum and Tweedledee two-party duopoly. It is this that strikes a visitor to America as the truly quaint thing about its political culture. The G &amp; S line about \"either a little Liberal or a little Conservative\" doesn't apply here any more, if it ever did. But for almost 150 years, every American boy and gal that's born into the world alive has been either a Republican or a Democrat.</p> <p>In no European country has the shape of party politics been frozen in this way, a sclerosis no one has been able to cure. There is no American Tory or Labour party, no Social Democrats or Christian Democrats, still less any serious parties to further right or left. And the truth is that the differences between Democrats and Republicans - even supposedly liberal Democrats and supposedly conservative Republicans - have often been slight by European political standards.</p> <p>In Seattle last Thursday, Nader repeated his central themes: \"Don't go for the lesser of two evils, because at the end of the day, you end up with evil.\" And, \"Bush and Gore don't matter. They're just battling over who's going to go into the White House to take marching orders from their corporate paymasters.\" From whatever political position American politics are viewed, that was near the knuckle. The great issue in this election was campaign finance. Or it should have been: raised by mavericks like John McCain on the right and Nader on the left, it was studiously ignored by both Bush and Gore.</p> <p>Whatever he says on particular issues, Nader surely ought to be applauded in principle as one more, all too rare authentic populist attack on the American political culture, with its empty double act, and its inability to tune into the real wishes of the people outside a narrow waveband controlled by a solipsistic political elite. Quite apart from those voting for Nader, there was another eloquent block of voters yesterday, the 50-something per cent who didn't vote at all. What does their abstention say about the system? Are they \"spoilers\" too?</p> <p>Jonathan Freedland's column will appear tomorrow. <a href=\"wheaty@compuserve.com\">wheaty@compuserve.com</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Gerald Corbett, the Railtrack chief executive, yesterday blamed the wrong trains on the wrong tracks for the chaos and disruption on Britain's rail network that is likely to last well into the new year. He admitted his embattled company had discovered that rails with the hair's breadth cracks known as gauge corner cracking, seen as the most likely cause of last month's Hatfield crash which killed four passengers, were only one year old. But he warned the Confederation of British Industry's national conference in Birmingham that government plans to introduce laws on corporate manslaughter would decrease safety on the railways and create a \"buck-passing, secretive culture\". Mr Corbett's comments came as the head of a leading train operating company refused to back a vote of confidence in the Railtrack chief. Moir Lockhead, chief executive of FirstGroup which operates three rail franchises, batted away the question, saying he was confident Railtrack was working hard to get the railway back into working order \"and that's all you're going to get from me\". Mr Corbett told delegates Railtrack had been forced to call in academic experts to help provide a quick solution to the problem of gauge corner cracking, but the initial view was that this \"is all to do with the wheel-rail relationship\" - code for the pressure that fast-running trains exert on the track. In a remarkable display of openness about Railtrack's difficulties, he revealed that during the recent \"re-railing\" of 50 miles of track after inspection of 2,800 sites the company had found many year-old rails with cracks. \"We dug up a whole load of rails north of Rugby at the weekend [which] we put in last year as part of the broken rail recovery programme and found they suffered from gauge corner cracking,\" he said. Similar defects had been found in track near Wimbledon, south-west London. Mr Corbett said the problem would be resolved in most areas by the new year, but in some places it would continue into January. But he indicated a more deep-rooted problem was that the wrong trains were running on the tracks. \"There are trains on the track in which we - who own the track - have no say in their design or specification and that can't be right for optimising the wheel-rail relationship,\" he said. The problem was particularly acute with freight trains \"thundering\" over tracks - a 24-tonne train exerts 14 times more pressure on the rails than a 14-tonne two-carriage \"sprinter\". Mr Corbett held out the prospect of dedicated tracks for freight trains, ending the practice which causes slow-moving goods trains to be sent to sidings to allow passenger trains priority. His offer to resign immediately after the Hatfield crash was rejected by the Railtrack board, but yesterday he was unrepentant about the network's performance since privatisation, claiming that the number of broken rails had dropped by 30% and signals passed at danger by 13% in the first seven months of this year. Train delays, he added, were down by 44% in the same period, even with a sharp increase in traffic. \"Before Hatfield we had the best four months for the railway ever.\" But Mr Corbett said legislation on corporate manslaughter following the Hatfield, Ladbroke Grove and Southall rail crashes would create a culture in which \"everybody is interested in protecting themselves because of the likelihood of criminal proceedings\".

Speaking as the government published its second annual report into its anti-drugs strategy, Ms Mowlam said that, with a number of scientific trials on the soft drug drawing to a close, official backing for the legalisation of cannaboids - a derivative which is not smoked and which could help sufferers of MS and spina bifida - could be given from the end of 2001. But Downing Street and the Department of Health swiftly insisted the current trials would have to be assessed by the Committee of Safety of Medicines before being given approval - which would take at least another four years. Questioned on the fact that her comments on BBC Radio 4's Today programme appeared at odds with government policy, Ms Mowlam, the minister in charge of coordinating drugs policy and the only cabinet minister to admit to having smoked the drug, was forced, just three hours later, to admit she had made a mistake. \"I probably underestimated the time it would take to get through all the different phases,\" she added. \"I was going on the results of a visit to a scientific centre where the research was being done but ... if that's what No 10 are saying, obviously it's right. ,If they feel it can't be done quicker ... he's the prime minister.\" Her implied frustration with the government's timescale reflects her belief that there should be a more open debate on the legalisation of the drug. While the home secretary, Jack Straw, and Mr Blair take a tougher line, public support for the legalisation of cannabis in general, and for medicinal use in particular, grows. Only this year, two MS sufferers who used cannabis to alleviate their suffering were cleared of possession by juries, while, last month, a Mori poll found nearly nine out of 10 people believe it should be allowed for medicinal purposes.

Scientists now believe they could put the nucleus of a patient's cell into an unfertilised egg, watch it divide and take from it the embryo stem cells that are the precursors of all human tissue. Then they would be able to tailor new \"personalised\" nerve stem cells for people with neurodegenerative diseases, or pancreatic stem cells for children with diabetes. The proposal has been dubbed \"therapeutic cloning\". It has alarmed anti-abortion campaigners and some who see it as a step toward the cloning of human beings. A 10-minute rule private member's bill calling for embryo stem cell research, introduced by the Liberal Democrat MP Evan Harris, was roundly defeated last week. But the government is expected to make parliamentary time available for debate.",

Problems in the east London authority were compounded by Whitehall's new local government inspectorate which effectively put the council on probation and warned that ministers might have to intervene to save the borough from financial meltdown. In a scathing report, the inspectorate, part of the audit commission, concluded that Hackney's financial and operational problems were so serious that it needed outside help. With the refuse collection service collapsing amid reports of rats scavenging in piles of rubbish, up to half the borough's council tax uncollected and 17,000 poorer residents waiting for unpaid housing benefit, riot police were called to a council meeting this week to protect councillors from angry residents. Around 500 redundancies are likely as the council tries to drive through \u00a322.5m of cuts. Labour group leader Jules Pipe, who runs the council with the Tory leader Eric Oller-enshaw, promised essential social services would run and schools would not close. The council disclosed yesterday that its new managing director, Max Caller, had been holding talks with the government in an attempt to get extra help. \"Hackney is in a very precarious financial situation and the problems it faces are far worse than anyone imagined,\" he said last night. Dianne Abbott, Labour MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, urged ministers to give the council an emergency grant to save essential services. After damning reports from education and social services inspectorates, as well as from the government's district au ditor, hopes were high that Hackney had achieved stability under an unprecedented Labour-Tory administration. But after a special inspection, the local government inspectorate listed a catalogue of failure and reported to ministers that Hackney was unable to meet financial commitments. Wendy Thomson, director of inspection at the audit commission and the former chief executive of nearby Newham council, said: \"Hackney is not a well run council and is letting down the people who live in the borough.\" The commission has given the council until February to get its finances in order by agreeing spending cuts, collecting council tax and making housing benefit payments.

Slashing prices has a measurable cost. You can't just go round saying \"10% cheaper than last year\", \"lowest prices since 1992\" without acknowledging that it means some farm worker losing his job, some haulier laying off his drivers, or textile workers losing their factory in Manchester because there's cheaper labour in India.</p> <p><b>Tim Finney </b><br> Bishopstone,<br> Wiltshire <br><a href=\"mailto: info@helenbrowning organics.co.uk\">info@helenbrowning organics.co.uk</a></p> <p>\u0095 You present a misleading impression of some of the costs for hauliers (Super- markets play key role in hauliers rising costs, November 7); \u00a3840 to fill a 1,000-litre tank equates to a price per litre of 84p. But by removing the VAT, which hauliers can reclaim, they would be paying 71.5p per litre. Also, most hauliers have their own bunkers and buy fuel direct from the oil companies in bulk. This results in a further 2p to 3p reduction per litre. Therefore the cost to the haulier is 68.5p per litre, significantly less than is being quoted by the road-haulage lobby.</p> <p>Also, the vehicle excise duty quoted of \u00a33,950 (five axles across the tractor/trailer combination) can be reduced to \u00a32,950 for pollution-friendly vehicles and, by operating six axles, reduced further to \u00a31,500. The haulage industry is basically suffering from overcapacity, hence supermarkets and other large organisations are able to drive down their transport costs.</p> <p><b>Michael Hatfield</b><br> Chester</p> <p>\u0095 I'm a partner in a distribution business running 10 trucks. At first sight we would stand to gain \u00a360,000 if the government fully accepted the demands to cut fuel taxes. But I don't support the campaign because it does not make business sense. High taxes are a red herring. The problem smaller hauliers face is not overheads but excessive (and often unfair) competition. All these financial gains would be lost as the frantic haulage market drove prices back down to rock bottom. The small operators and particularly the owner-operators could collectively agree minimum prices below which they would not bid for work and also gain economies of scale (eg in bulk buying) enjoyed by the big players.</p> <p>Whatever, the government must get the cowboys off the roads. By driving illegally and unsafely they can undercut any fair price, endangering the public and providing appalling service which damages the reputation of the industry. Please print only my email address. I don't want my depot blockaded.</p> <p><b> Bob Cannell </b><br><a href=\"mailto:bobcannell@hotmail.com\">bobcannell@hotmail.com</a></p> <p>\u0095 I was disappointed to read that the \"Jarrow\" convoy of road hauliers has retracted its promise to go slow. Given the alarming road accident record of heavy goods vehicles this had seemed to be the most constructive part of the promised protest. For every kilometre they drive, HGV drivers are twice as likely to be involved in a fatal accident as car drivers.</p> <p>They're also are more than three times more likely to be involved in an accident on minor roads than on the motorway, which may explain why 20% of their road death victims are pedestrians or cyclists. The fault seems to lie with carelessness rather than tiredness, since the peak time for HGV accidents is 8-9am. A permanent go slow sounds like a very attractive proposition.</p> <p><b> Katherine G White</b><br>London <br><a href=\"mailto:kgwhite@netcomuk.co.uk\">kgwhite@netcomuk.co.uk</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "\u0095 At last someone's had the balls to say it like it is - the hauliers are in despair not because of high fuel costs, but because business, and consumers like me, refuse to pay the real price for goods (Truckers attacking the wrong enemy, November 7). Slashing prices has a measurable cost. You can't just go round saying \"10% cheaper than last year\", \"lowest prices since 1992\" without acknowledging that it means some farm worker losing his job, some haulier laying off his drivers, or textile workers losing their factory in Manchester because there's cheaper labour in India. Tim Finney Bishopstone, Wiltshire info@helenbrowning organics.co.uk \u0095 You present a misleading impression of some of the costs for hauliers (Super- markets play key role in hauliers rising costs, November 7); \u00a3840 to fill a 1,000-litre tank equates to a price per litre of 84p. But by removing the VAT, which hauliers can reclaim, they would be paying 71.5p per litre. Also, most hauliers have their own bunkers and buy fuel direct from the oil companies in bulk. This results in a further 2p to 3p reduction per litre. Therefore the cost to the haulier is 68.5p per litre, significantly less than is being quoted by the road-haulage lobby. Also, the vehicle excise duty quoted of \u00a33,950 (five axles across the tractor/trailer combination) can be reduced to \u00a32,950 for pollution-friendly vehicles and, by operating six axles, reduced further to \u00a31,500. The haulage industry is basically suffering from overcapacity, hence supermarkets and other large organisations are able to drive down their transport costs. Michael Hatfield Chester \u0095 I'm a partner in a distribution business running 10 trucks. At first sight we would stand to gain \u00a360,000 if the government fully accepted the demands to cut fuel taxes. But I don't support the campaign because it does not make business sense. High taxes are a red herring. The problem smaller hauliers face is not overheads but excessive (and often unfair) competition. All these financial gains would be lost as the frantic haulage market drove prices back down to rock bottom. The small operators and particularly the owner-operators could collectively agree minimum prices below which they would not bid for work and also gain economies of scale (eg in bulk buying) enjoyed by the big players. Whatever, the government must get the cowboys off the roads. By driving illegally and unsafely they can undercut any fair price, endangering the public and providing appalling service which damages the reputation of the industry. Please print only my email address. I don't want my depot blockaded. Bob Cannell bobcannell@hotmail.com \u0095 I was disappointed to read that the \"Jarrow\" convoy of road hauliers has retracted its promise to go slow. Given the alarming road accident record of heavy goods vehicles this had seemed to be the most constructive part of the promised protest. For every kilometre they drive, HGV drivers are twice as likely to be involved in a fatal accident as car drivers. They're also are more than three times more likely to be involved in an accident on minor roads than on the motorway, which may explain why 20% of their road death victims are pedestrians or cyclists. The fault seems to lie with carelessness rather than tiredness, since the peak time for HGV accidents is 8-9am. A permanent go slow sounds like a very attractive proposition.

The intervening period has been a torrid tale. </p> <p>If the store group's new Belgian chairman fails to find solutions to the litany of customer criticisms - the wrong clothes in unappealing stores at too high prices - M&amp;S will go down in history as one of the most stunning falls from grace in the nation's corporate history. If Mr Vandevelde and his new team succeed, they will be lauded for the biggest turnaround ever. </p> <p>Everyone has a view on M&amp;S, from shoppers to City analysts, big investors and the staff themselves. On the streets of Birmingham, care assistant Pat Burton, 56, speaks for many: \"One minute they are claiming to be really fashionable with lots of trendy clothes for young people and the next we are bombarded with adverts saying the clothes are for larger women. They need to listen to what people really want rather than acting on a whim.\" </p> <p>Even in its heyday, which, believe it or not could be dated back only three years, few customers flocked to M&amp;S because it was trendy and cutting-edge. It was its dependability, providing clothing items that were good value but nondescript enough not to stand out. </p> <p>\"M&amp;S needs to realise what they are good at, essentially supplying anonymous basics,\" is the advice of a leading City investor. \"You don't want to turn up at a cocktail party in the same dress as someone else, but a big, black leather coat is completely different thing.\" </p> <p>Even the food halls have problems. Until last month it was thought the M&amp;S food operation had been largely immune to the group's problems, but the recent competition commission report into super- markets revealed that its food profits - which M&amp;S has always kept secret - have been hammered in recent years. </p> <p>Despite all its difficulties Marks &amp; Spencer has 11% of the British clothing market, sells one in four men's suits and one in four pairs of women's knickers. Its margins and sales per square foot are ahead of many rivals. But, its shares keep falling. Three years ago they were changing hands at 664p, valuing the company at \u00a319bn. Now they are languishing at just 195p, the company is worth barely \u00a35bn, the basic value of its property, placing no value on the contents of its stores. Rumours of fresh takeover bids have resurfaced. Some City analysts say the shares are still too expensive. </p> <p>Richard Hyman, chairman of retail consultancy Verdict, says: \"Basically, they were a victim of their own success. Being the best, as M&amp;S were for so long, is bound to foster an element of arrogance and being inward looking.\" </p> <p>That corporate culture, instilled by the autocratic and now deposed chairman and chief executive, Sir Richard Greenbury, meant M&amp;S failed to spot a change in the fast-moving world of British shopping. Speed is of the essence in the e-age, and this has fed through to fashions which are changing faster than ever. </p> <p>The high street has also become polarised and has to compete with American-style out-of-town malls. Shoppers now either chase labels or low prices. The middle market, M&amp;S's playground, has withered. Its fresh attempts to appeal to the masses through its first television campaign, featuring a larger, naked woman, appear to have backfired. </p> <p>\"Marks &amp; Spencer treated the competition far too lightly,\" said Mr Hyman. \"They just didn't see Next and Debenhams changing dramatically to reposition themselves in Marks &amp; Spencer's backyard. For years M&amp;S did quality at prices people could afford. Then Next and Debenhams started to provide a genuine alternative - good, focused branding and better ranging.\" </p> <p>The management was probably a bigger problem. Throughout the 1990s the company was led by \u00a31m-a-year Sir Richard. \"He was a strong and focused leader, but M&amp;S suffered through not having another strong man in the boardroom that Greenbury would listen to. And he did not manage the succession,\" says Mr Hyman. The result was that when Marks &amp; Spencer's sales \"fell off a cliff\" as Sir Richard put it in 1998, a boardroom squabble broke out. Sir Richard was forced to hand over the chief executive's job to Peter Salsbury and eventually resigned altogether. Mr Salsbury has since been ousted and Mr Vandevelde has axed most of the board. </p> <p>M&amp;S expanded in 1997 at precisely the wrong time Shoppers were flush with cash from a series of building society windfalls. M&amp;S splashed out \u00a3192m to buy 19 of Littlewoods' largest stores. Three years on, the stores are not performing. with only three or four profitable. </p> <p>The new management is starting to make changes, getting rid of the endless rails of clothes in barn-like premises, introducing \"concept\" stores, where merchandise is grouped according to lifestyles, and its Autograph range of premium-priced clothing put together by designers such as Katharine Hamnett and Julien Macdonald. Innovations such as personal shoppers in some stores, beauty consultation areas, sizes for larger women, maternity clothes and lingerie-only shops in Europe are all welcome but there are still problems as the group's smaller British stores are not big enough to convert into the \"concept\" format and any plans M&amp;S has for them are either non-existent or top secret. </p> <p>One top shareholder said: \"What is clear is that it isn't going to be a quick fix. It's a long slog but I doubt whether they will ever get back to their previous dominance\". </p> <p>Richard Hyman believes M&amp;S's supertanker proportions could ultimately be its salvation. \"In 20 years we will look back and say this was when UK retailing changed fundamentally. It will be much lower margin. There won't be much scope for small businesses. You will need to drive volume to make money and that means being big.\" </p> <p>The beleaguered staff also refuse to give up hope. An assistant in the Liverpool store, said: \"We are now listening to our customers more than we have ever done and the tide is definitely turning. I am not worried about my job - there is no way M&amp;S will go out of business.\"</p>",

Insurance firm Royal &amp; Sun Alliance, which has 4.5%, had also undertaken to accept the family buyout unless a competing offer emerged worth at least 10% more.</p> <p>Sara Lee believed it would be able to capture Royal &amp; Sun Alliance's approval until last week, when it became clear that a highly unusual clause in the insurer's acceptance undertaking allowed competing bidders only one chance. The clause allowed the family consortium to match any higher bid but banned outsiders from increasing their offers any further.</p> <p>A source close to Sara Lee said this scuppered the US firm's chances: \"They didn't make that clear in their first announcement. It's outrageous for them to miss out a crucial term of an irrevocable undertaking.\"</p> <p>Bernard Matthews' managing director, David Joll, said the family firm had disclosed the crucial clause in its offer document last Wednesday, five days after revealing its intention to bid.</p> <p>He said: \"It's not new information; it was made available to their advisers some time ago.\"</p> <p>The Matthews family, which is backed by HSBC, is offering 185p cash per share and is in the process of putting together a share alternative.</p> <p>Mr Matthews issued a statement last night saying: \"Now it is back to business with everyone working to supply our millions of customers with their Christmas turkeys.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Norfolk turkey farmer Bernard Matthews looks likely to succeed in his \u00a3232m bid to take his poultry empire private after US food conglomerate Sara Lee abandoned plans for a rival offer at the eleventh hour yesterday. Sara Lee withdrew just 24 hours before the final deadline for competing bids, in a surprise move which triggered glee at Bernard Matthews' Norwich headquarters. Mr Matthews said he was \"delighted\" at the news, adding that his consortium would \"look forward to progessing its full, fair and recommended offer for Bernard Matthews plc and returning it to family ownership\". Tension between the two sides remained high as advisers to the American firm accused Mr Matthews' side of \"outrageous\" conduct in withholding vital information until the last minute. Sara Lee always faced an uphill task, as Mr Matthews' family controlled 42% of the turkey firm's shares. Insurance firm Royal &amp; Sun Alliance, which has 4.5%, had also undertaken to accept the family buyout unless a competing offer emerged worth at least 10% more. Sara Lee believed it would be able to capture Royal &amp; Sun Alliance's approval until last week, when it became clear that a highly unusual clause in the insurer's acceptance undertaking allowed competing bidders only one chance. The clause allowed the family consortium to match any higher bid but banned outsiders from increasing their offers any further. A source close to Sara Lee said this scuppered the US firm's chances: \"They didn't make that clear in their first announcement. It's outrageous for them to miss out a crucial term of an irrevocable undertaking.\" Bernard Matthews' managing director, David Joll, said the family firm had disclosed the crucial clause in its offer document last Wednesday, five days after revealing its intention to bid. He said: \"It's not new information; it was made available to their advisers some time ago.\" The Matthews family, which is backed by HSBC, is offering 185p cash per share and is in the process of putting together a share alternative. Mr Matthews issued a statement last night saying: \"Now it is back to business with everyone working to supply our millions of customers with their Christmas turkeys.\"",

      "bodyText": "The Indonesian attorney general announced yesterday that the Suharto estate in Jakarta would be searched for the former president's fugitive youngest son Hutomo \"Tommy\" Mandala Putra, who should have begun a jail sentence on Friday for defrauding the state of \u00a37.5m. Marzuki Darusman said he believed Putra was hiding at his home in the collection of family houses, known as Cendana, which was bristling with private security guards yesterday. An intelligence source told Reuters that there were up to 200 guards in case of trouble tomorrow, when protesters are planning a march to the estate . But the authorities' farcically inept attempts to jail the playboy billionaire, and his lawyers' increasingly ridiculous excuses to stall the process, are fooling no one. The whole affair, which is eroding what remnants of credibility President Abdurrahman Wahid has, is seen as the latest and most public manifestation of the power the Suharto family still wields, two years after its downfall. Tommy, as he is universally known in Indonesia, was declared a fugitive at one minute past midnight after he failed to arrive at the Cipinang high security jail in Jakarta to begin his 18-month sentence. The police waited until the afternoon to mobilise four teams of elite officers to look for him in the capital. Having announced where they were going to look, they had found out nothing about his whereabouts by late last night. Meanwhile his lawyers took turns saying it was time for Tommy, 38, to abide by the law and that he could not turn himself in until he was guaranteed round-the-clock protection against threats of sodomy and murder in jail. Twenty-four hours earlier one of the lawyers, Nudirman Munir, had said Tommy would surrender only when he was shown the original of the presidential decree rejecting a pardon. This was provided, but Tommy failed to appear. It should never have got this far. The Indonesian media are asking why he was not imprisoned immediately when con victed on September 22, why he was not kept under surveillance during the stay of enforcement, and why the prosecutors let him leave for a \"vital family engagement\" on Friday afternoon when an arrest warrant had already been served. Mr Darusman insisted yesterday that there was nothing political in Tommy's disappearance, but few Indonesians believe it, particularly as President Wahid met him in a Jakarta hotel while his appeal for a pardon was being considered. The Jakarta Post wrote in an editorial this week: \"With things as they are at present, [the president's] observation that his rejection of Tommy's appeal for a pardon is proof that the law rules supreme, and that the principle of equality before the law has been established, sounds rather hollow.\" Endy Bayuni, the paper's managing editor, said that Tommy \"honestly thinks he has done wonders for the country and that his father was an amazing president, so why should he go to jail\". Tommy and his five siblings amassed huge fortunes while their father ruled Indonesia for 32 years until May 1998. Tommy has powerful friends, including government members, who are able to protect him, leaving President Wahid powerless, Mr Bayuni said. \"Tommy's whole intention is to turn this into a farce for Gus Dur\" - the president's nickname. \"Tommy knows Gus Dur has staked his whole reputation on getting the Suhartos into prison and so he's doing everything he can to undermine him.\"",

      "body": "<p>Al Gore voted in his home town of Carthage, not far from his campaign headquarters in Nashville, after an extraordinary sweep through 11 states, an indication of how tight the contest was being seen right until the very last moment. His final campaign appearance before voting started was in Tampa, Florida, when he met a group of night-shift care workers at 4am.</p> <p>Florida was chosen for the last trip as a signal of how much Mr Gore valued its votes. \"It's not an accident that it's here in Tampa,\" Mr Gore, his eyes almost closed with weariness, told the workers, \"because Florida may well be the state that decides this contest.\" George W Bush's brother Jeb is governor of the state.</p> <p>As the votes began to come in under the sunny Tennessee skies, the Democrats' vice-presidential candidate, Joe Lieberman, and his wife arrived to watch the results with the Gores at a Nashville hotel. Then it was on to the War Memorial Plaza for the last of the hundreds of rallies of the campaign.</p> <p>Bob Schrum, a senior Gore adviser, would only say at a press conference in Nashville that the team was \"very tired and very optimistic\". Then Mr Gore's 100,000 volunteers started telephoning voters to get them down to the polls, and sending off the last of the 30m emails that have been dispatched throughout the campaign.</p> <p>This has been the first internet election and the Democrats' young team has made full use of it. The implications of reaching voters this way are enormous because it allows candidates to home in with very specific messages to groups.</p> <p>There was an indication of the international interest in the campaign from the number of foreign journalists who were in Nashville to cover the results. A total of 231 foreign correspondents were still in town, with Japan having most (58), followed by the UK (39), Spain (28), France (15), Germany (14), Russia and Italy (both 12).

      "bodyText": "Al Gore voted in his home town of Carthage, not far from his campaign headquarters in Nashville, after an extraordinary sweep through 11 states, an indication of how tight the contest was being seen right until the very last moment. His final campaign appearance before voting started was in Tampa, Florida, when he met a group of night-shift care workers at 4am. Florida was chosen for the last trip as a signal of how much Mr Gore valued its votes. \"It's not an accident that it's here in Tampa,\" Mr Gore, his eyes almost closed with weariness, told the workers, \"because Florida may well be the state that decides this contest.\" George W Bush's brother Jeb is governor of the state. As the votes began to come in under the sunny Tennessee skies, the Democrats' vice-presidential candidate, Joe Lieberman, and his wife arrived to watch the results with the Gores at a Nashville hotel. Then it was on to the War Memorial Plaza for the last of the hundreds of rallies of the campaign. Bob Schrum, a senior Gore adviser, would only say at a press conference in Nashville that the team was \"very tired and very optimistic\". Then Mr Gore's 100,000 volunteers started telephoning voters to get them down to the polls, and sending off the last of the 30m emails that have been dispatched throughout the campaign. This has been the first internet election and the Democrats' young team has made full use of it. The implications of reaching voters this way are enormous because it allows candidates to home in with very specific messages to groups. There was an indication of the international interest in the campaign from the number of foreign journalists who were in Nashville to cover the results. A total of 231 foreign correspondents were still in town, with Japan having most (58), followed by the UK (39), Spain (28), France (15), Germany (14), Russia and Italy (both 12). The Russians and Spanish have most television crews (five each). Even as the votes were being counted, there were discussions under way on how Mr Gore could have run a better campaign, particularly when he seemed to be riding high in opinion polls before the three televised debates. It is privately accepted by Gore advisers that he failed to capitalise on his lead and on the healthy US economy, and presented the kind of personality that clearly turned off many undecided voters, with what many perceived as arrogance. Another problem for Mr Gore was his inability to enthuse the left both within his party and among those who voted for Ralph Nader. Many on the left outside the Democratic party took the view that Mr Gore was not much better than Mr Bush, and made it clear that they believed it did not matter if the Green candidate allowed the Republicans in. On election eve in Harlem, New York, Mr Nader was repeating one of his campaign mantras that \"the only difference between Gore and Bush is the velocity with which their knees hit the floor when corporations bang on their door\". Mr Nader, regarded in the Gore camp as the \"grim reaper\", was not thought to pose a problem until the later stages of the campaign, when it became clear that he was polling better than expected in key states such as Oregon and Pennsylvania. By then, he had gathered momentum and the Republicans were happy to see him play the role that Ross Perot did in 1992, when his votes were widely seen as helping Bill Clinton defeat George W Bush's father. But for all that, Mr Gore's supporters, gathering in their hundreds in central Nashville, were standing by their man, in the homeland of country music.

      "bodyText": "\u0095 The picture illustrating our report about a crop mark in the shape of a seven-pointed star, page 7, yesterday, puzzled some readers who could only count six points. It was (no pun intended) the way it was cropped. A wider view would have provided the extra point. \u0095 Media Monkey, page 7, Media, November 6, suggested that Have I Got News For You looked out of place in its new position on BBC1 at 10pm. It would. The spot is occupied by the main nightly news. Have I Got News For You is now on BBC1 at 9pm on Fridays (where the other news used to be). \u0095 Mervyn John [sic] did not play the \"stern mum\" in the 1945 film Pink String and Sealing Wax, page 55, The Guide, November 4. Mervyn Johns played the stern father. \u0095 In the feature \"never travels without\" page 9, Travel, November 4, Kim Winter, the co-editor of the Which? Hotel Guide 2001, as she was correctly identified at the end of the column, appeared at the beginning of it as Kim Newman. Apologies. \u0095 The co-designer of the London Eye is David Marks, and not, as we had it on page 24, November 6, Denis Marks. Apologies. \u0095 In a piece about planning the Booker Prize ceremony, page 7, Office Hours, November 6, Roddy Doyle's Booker-winning novel was referred to as Paddy Doyle Ha Ha Ha. The title is Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha. \u0095 The telephone number of the helpline provided by the National Meningitis Trust, was - unhelpfully - given wrongly at the end of a an article in Health, page 15, G2, yesterday. Sorry about that. The correct number is 0845 6000 800. \u0095 We should have referred to the public record office (not records), in our piece on Diego Garcia, page 3, November 4. It is the policy of the Guardian to correct significant errors as soon as possible. Please quote the date and page number.

      "bodyText": "Russia abandoned its efforts yesterday to raise the corpses of 106 seamen remaining inside the sunken submarine Kursk when the Norwegian diving platform Regalia left the scene of the disaster in the Barents Sea to head home. After 17 days of descending into the icy Arctic depths, cutting their way repeatedly into the vessel, and retrieving the bodies of 12 sailors, the joint team of Russian and Norwegian deep-sea divers was stood down. At a meeting on board the Regalia yesterday morning it was decided to halt the mission. Russian officers made plain that the navy was against cutting any more holes in the 150-metre submarine, which sank off Murmansk on August 12. Plans are being made to try to raise the nuclear-powered vessel next summer, although the cost of such an operation is being put at \u00a335m. It is thought that the Russians have neither the technical means nor the funds to conduct the salvage operation. The 18 divers involved in recovering the bodies were reported to have observed a minute's silence yesterday for the 106 submariners buried at sea and cast flowers on the water before the Regalia departed for its home port in Norway. Captain Vladimir Navrotsky, the Russian navy spokesman, said: \"They stood at attention on the Regalia and released a wreath into the water. \"In their short speeches, the divers said they did everything they could for the Kursk, even more.\" Captain Navrotsky said that further cutting of the submarine could jeopardise the hoisting plans, and he hinted that the cutting could also create problems with the vessel's two nuclear reactors. High seas and strong winds have also been complicating the operation. All 12 of the bodies brought to the surface from the stern of the Kursk have been identified, and the discovery of a letter written by one of the trapped seamen while the sub lay crippled gave the lie to statements from President Vladimir Putin and officials that the 118 crewmen died instantly when two explosions sank the sub on August 12. It is now known that at least 23 of the crewsurvived the initial blasts. There are also some claims that the survivors may have lived on for several days afterwards, but these are contentious. The Russian state commission investigating the tragedy, headed by the deputy prime minister Ilya Klebanov, is to meet today. Senior navy officers cling to the view that the Kursk was sunk by a collision, since covered up, with an American or British submarine. Both countries have denied being involved. Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov, the navy chief, said he would defend this collision scenario at today's meeting. \"I've got facts, but not enough proof. But that's only a question of time. The proof is not only at the bottom of the sea,\" he said. Igor Kudrik, an expert on the Russian navy with the Norwegian environmental organisation Bellona, dismissed the recurring Russian claims of a collision cover-up. \"The submarine disaster was caused by an accident inside the submarine. \"But a final conclusion can only be made after the submarine has been lifted, if the Russian authorities agree to tell the truth about this tragedy.\"",

Now that much of that cash has fallen away it is producing unflattering comparisons with last year. </p> <p>GWR has managed to avoid the cycle. Most of that cash was aimed at metropolitan areas where GWR owns few stations. It did not benefit as much from the dot.com explosion and neither has it suffered by comparison. </p> <p>The company yesterday reported a 24% increase in revenues to \u00a316.9m for the first half of the year. </p> <p>Profits were dented by investment in building a series of local internet portals and supporting digital services and fell from \u00a39.1m to \u00a36.9m. GWR's shares fell 3% to 782.5p against their peak of \u00a311.14 in March. </p> <p>The level of investment in the internet might be of concern although analysts widely agree that if a local radio company cannot make money from the web then no media owner can. </p> <p>The real focus though should be on GWR's stewardship of Classic FM since acquiring the station in 1996, which demonstrates the company's core ability to manage radio stations well. GWR has built Classic's share of audience over that period from 2.6% to 4.3% of the national listening audience. </p> <p>According to Rajar, 6m people now tune in for an average 7.2 hours a week against 4.5m for four hours a week. That has translated through to revenue growth of 28% for the station. </p> <p>With the communications white paper due next month and likely to relax ownership rules GWR will be able to acquire further stations and encourage the same kind of growth elsewhere.

Now that much of that cash has fallen away it is producing unflattering comparisons with last year. GWR has managed to avoid the cycle. Most of that cash was aimed at metropolitan areas where GWR owns few stations. It did not benefit as much from the dot.com explosion and neither has it suffered by comparison. The company yesterday reported a 24% increase in revenues to \u00a316.9m for the first half of the year. Profits were dented by investment in building a series of local internet portals and supporting digital services and fell from \u00a39.1m to \u00a36.9m. GWR's shares fell 3% to 782.5p against their peak of \u00a311.14 in March. The level of investment in the internet might be of concern although analysts widely agree that if a local radio company cannot make money from the web then no media owner can. The real focus though should be on GWR's stewardship of Classic FM since acquiring the station in 1996, which demonstrates the company's core ability to manage radio stations well. GWR has built Classic's share of audience over that period from 2.6% to 4.3% of the national listening audience. According to Rajar, 6m people now tune in for an average 7.2 hours a week against 4.5m for four hours a week. That has translated through to revenue growth of 28% for the station. With the communications white paper due next month and likely to relax ownership rules GWR will be able to acquire further stations and encourage the same kind of growth elsewhere. Buy.",

      "bodyText": "President Jacques Chirac intervened in France's spiralling beef crisis yesterday as the junior health minister, Dominique Gillot, warned people to expect many more deaths from new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is believed to come from the meat of cows infected with BSE. Amid mounting consumer fears about the safety of French beef, Mr Chirac was joined by the daily Le Monde in calling for an immediate ban on the use of meat and bone meal in animal feed, a measure adopted by Britain in 1996. Most French cases of BSE - bovine spongiform encephalopathy, colloquially known in France as vache folle, or mad cow disease - have been traced to cattle eating feed containing such meal, intended for pigs or chickens. Two people have so far died of new variant CJD (vCJD) in France, compared with 80 in Britain, but a threefold increase in the number of BSE cases identified in cattle this year, combined with a hypermarket chain's admission that it had unwittingly sold several tonnes of suspect beef, have sparked near panic in consumers and school authorities. \"With the increase in the number of cases of mad cow disease discovered in France, it is highly likely that we will have several dozen cases of vCJD,\" Ms Gillot said. \"We must prepare for that. The number of people showing possible symptoms of the disease is rising.\" Amid what the agriculture minister, Jean Glavany, called a \"national psychosis\", beef sales have plummeted by as much as 40%; mayors in a dozen main towns and cities have banned beef from school canteens; restaurants have dropped beef on the bone from their menus; and the Socialist-led government faces at least two lawsuits accusing it of failing to take adequate action to keep BSE out of France. Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9, a leading anti-globalisation campaigner who supports the return to traditional farming methods, wants every agriculture minister since 1988 put in the dock as \"accessories\" to the illegal importation of 14,000 tonnes of British meat and bone meal to France between 1993 to 1996, in defiance of a ban imposed in 1990. Separately, the parents of a 19-year-old man believed to be suffering from vCJD plan to sue the state for \"poisoning\" their son, who was featured in a harrowing French TV documentary broadcast on Monday. The government has asked the national food safety agency, Afssa, to assess whether the ban on meat and bone meal in cattle feed should be extended to mixtures fed to pigs and chickens. But Mr Chirac does not want to wait the three to four months the agency is expected to take to deliver its verdict. \"In my opinion, without waiting for the results, we must suspend use of these meals in all animals feeds,\" he said on TV. Le Monde agreed. \"This consumer panic is certainly excessive and perhaps unjustified,\" it said. \"But it is indispensable that steps be taken rapidly to allay people's fears. A ban on meat and bone meal in all ani mal feed is being studied by the experts - but there are times when experts must be pushed.\" The government's director of public health, Lucien Abenhaim, insisted that \"if there was a serious problem in butchers' cabinets, rest assured I would take the necessary action\". But Ms Gillot was less reassuring. \"I can't say 'don't worry' to people who ask me about it, because it's true that the prion [rogue protein particle] that causes both BSE and vCJD is a formidable infectious agent,\" she said. \"We do not know all its modes of transmission, and we have no treatment for it.\"",

No Morse, no Taggart, no Crimewatch UK, no humorous Randall and Hopkirk... in other words, we'd all be a lot better off, and to prove the point <strong> Cutting Edge</strong> (Channel 4) showed the full degradation to which a life of crime can lead. Shooters, a feature-length drama to kick off the new series, has already stirred up indignation for using real criminals in the main roles rather than actors, although for this we should be grateful. If there's one thing more irksome than real villains profiting from their misdeeds, it's British actors swaggering around in emulation of the hoods they will never be. </p> <p>Shooters followed a ramshackle Liverpool gang from a botched drugs heist through a downward spiral of violence and coke-fuelled hysteria. There was little to appeal, and much to repel: a cack-handed murder, with the victim bound hand and foot; gang fights on waste ground with the opponents biting each other's faces off; compulsive drug use that led to misery rather than elation. At the centre of the storm was Big John, a simple giant of a man, club bouncer by night and gangster by day. Big John witnessed, and in part caused, the initial murder; unconcerned by this, he shoved half the stolen gear up his nose and then drove around Liverpool in a big and very obviously new car. </p> <p>John's senior partner in crime was Dezzy, who looked like Craig David on steroids and was much the more intelligent of the two. He showed remorse by vomiting after the murder, and counselled discretion in the splashy wake of the crime. While John hoovered \"beak\" off the back of his hand like 21st-century snuff, Dezzy confessed the murder to his mother (\"you broke my heart\") and went into melancholic semi-retirement. </p> <p>Shooters was gripping not because of the simplistic moral (John died in a welter of blood in the back of his flash car) or because of the performances, excellent though they were. Where it scored over all other crime dramas was in its command of detail. While other shows indicate villainy by an agreed set of props and devices (usually involving pole-dancing clubs and Tudorbethan Barrett homes), Shooters revealed the desperate quality of life in which crime breeds and from which it can never deliver you. John and his face-biting pal Franny indulged in joyless beak-and-Baileys parties in their over-decorated flats. The gang met in sweaty desperation at the gym, bulking up their drug- ravaged torsos with ridiculous weights routines. Spare guns were stashed in the children's teddy-bear pyjama cases. Best of all was a scene in which the musketeers set off in a sports car, the owner unable to drive \"because I'm banned\". In a touching, pathetic gesture of gangster cool, all left their seatbelts undone. This, one suspects, is closer to underworld reality than Guy Ritchie and his lovely Lock, Stock cohorts would have us believe. </p> <p>The final scene, although unsubtle, was bludgeoningly effective. As Big John breathed his last, we cut to slow-motion footage of the nightclub where he worked, complete with a fairground music score. A clumsy device, but seldom has the link between \"innocent\" recreational drug use and organised crime been made with such persuasive force. </p> <p>Far from this reality was another sort of crime drama, <strong> The Sins</strong> (BBC1). Last night we reached Lust, and the show rose to the occasion with flair. Len (Pete Postlethwaite) still had one foot in the criminal underworld, personified by the standard flash villains in designer clothes. In-between, however, he had time for a mid-life sex crisis, persuading himself that he was gay after an unexpected gym stiffy followed hot on the heels of a bout of conjugal impotence. All this was compounded by the fact that his daughter, Chastity, was working her way through the entire male population of Oxford, sometimes two at a time. Cher could have told Len that naming your child Chastity doesn't necessarily make for a quiet life, but Len stormed off to Oxford to sort out his daughter, his sexuality and his criminal associates all in one go. </p> <p>This sounds stupendously contrived on the page, and it's a tribute to William Ivory's writing and Pete Postlethwaite's performance that it not only made sense but was actually moving and funny. The Sins is a strange show, schematic and occasionally halting, but when it works - in Len's final strophe on the joys of sexual love, for instance - it flies.</p>",

Mark Moody-Stewart took the first wave of Pavlovian flak, announcing Shell's billion-dollar-a-month gusher last week. </p> <p>However, Sir John was managing to do it on the eve of the Pre-Budget report - in the face of all those pre-speech briefings on the freezing of fuel duty. </p> <p>No wonder he was playing the profits down and insisting to anyone that would listen that retailing margins have been damaged across Europe by the recent fuel protests. The company's forecourts in Britain have even been losing money. </p> <p>Of course, a change in fuel duty does not have a direct impact on BP's profitability. A windfall tax, on the other hand, dressed up as a review of North Sea taxation, certainly would - and while the received wisdom remains that Gordon Brown will wait for more clarity on the medium-term price of crude before revisiting this, the threat remains that some sort of passing reference will be made later today. </p> <p>Actually getting more revenue out of the North Sea without damaging development in the area is another matter. Production there has risen by at least a quarter since the tax regime was last reformed in 1993. And thumping the Scottish economy in the run-up to an election might not seem such a great idea to Mr Brown next spring. </p> <p> <strong> M&amp;S paradox </strong><br> Marks &amp; Spencer boasts it is \"exclusively for everyone\" but its latest advertising campaign demonstrates just how much of a paradox that is. </p> <p>The former high street icon used a large, naked woman to inform shoppers that it is okay to be \"normal\" - known internally as the hallelujah campaign - and then followed it up this week with the \"breathless\" campaign - men ogling after a slim woman in M&amp;S party gear. </p> <p>This is the crux of the M&amp;S problem. Being \"exclusively for everyone\" is difficult to carry off when its role as a middle market retailer is being destroyed. </p> <p>Chairman Luc Vandevelde said M&amp;S was being attacked from both sides: Matalan leading the way for the discounters; Zara for the more up-market chains. M&amp;S is being squeezed and having difficulty working out where it stands. </p> <p>The prospects do not look good as M&amp;S enters the crucial seven week trading period before Christmas, from which it generates 25% of annualised profits. The staff are being offered performance-linked pay for the first time in their careers and, in the words of one executive director, have been \"empowered\". The centralisation of the past has been eradicated, it is also claimed. </p> <p>Persuading staff to sell is one thing but getting shoppers to spend is another, and, more importantly, spend at higher prices so that any rise in sales does not eat into profits. Finding more basic, classic items - like the black and camel leather coats selling at \u00a3190 - that customers will fight for must also be key. </p> <p>M&amp;S is selling \u00a3500,000 worth of such coats each week, a demonstration of the power it wields - when it gets it right. The problem is that when it gets its wrong the pain is big too. Lost sales from supply hiccups cost \u00a311m in sales in the first five weeks of the second half. Every sale counts in the current climate. M&amp;S does not look comfortable going into a cold, wet winter. </p> <p> <strong> Euro effects </strong><br> What a way to run a currency. Last Friday the European Central Bank moved into the foreign exchange market. It did the same again on Monday. It was, it said, concerned \"about the global and domestic repercussions of the exchange rate of the euro, including its impact on price stability\". </p> <p>Now, the FX market has still to make its mind up about the tactics and the timing of intervention. The ECB's statement, however, was at least consistent with the earlier G7 intervention and with the bank's stated policy priority. </p> <p>So what happens yesterday? Up pops Italian treasury minister Vincenzo Visco saying that the intervention was not driven by worries about inflation at all. Inflation was not a problem. </p> <p>Instead the bank's interventions were \"related to what [it] reckons to be useful to the euro and the signals on the currency level it wants to send to the market\". </p> <p>In the foot-shooting contest Mr Visco can make the claim of having scored with both barrels. </p> <p>Direct hit number 1: the only certainty central banks like to engender in FX markets is that they can and will intervene. What they usually try to avoid is giving the markets a target at which to aim - ie the exchange rate range it is either looking to achieve or wishes to defend. </p> <p>Direct hit number 2: whatever the policy, it is vital everyone sings from the same hymn sheet. FX markets interpret mixed messages as weakness. The euro is already weak enough.</p>",

A windfall tax, on the other hand, dressed up as a review of North Sea taxation, certainly would - and while the received wisdom remains that Gordon Brown will wait for more clarity on the medium-term price of crude before revisiting this, the threat remains that some sort of passing reference will be made later today. Actually getting more revenue out of the North Sea without damaging development in the area is another matter. Production there has risen by at least a quarter since the tax regime was last reformed in 1993. And thumping the Scottish economy in the run-up to an election might not seem such a great idea to Mr Brown next spring. M&amp;S paradox Marks &amp; Spencer boasts it is \"exclusively for everyone\" but its latest advertising campaign demonstrates just how much of a paradox that is. The former high street icon used a large, naked woman to inform shoppers that it is okay to be \"normal\" - known internally as the hallelujah campaign - and then followed it up this week with the \"breathless\" campaign - men ogling after a slim woman in M&amp;S party gear. This is the crux of the M&amp;S problem. Being \"exclusively for everyone\" is difficult to carry off when its role as a middle market retailer is being destroyed. Chairman Luc Vandevelde said M&amp;S was being attacked from both sides: Matalan leading the way for the discounters; Zara for the more up-market chains. M&amp;S is being squeezed and having difficulty working out where it stands. The prospects do not look good as M&amp;S enters the crucial seven week trading period before Christmas, from which it generates 25% of annualised profits. The staff are being offered performance-linked pay for the first time in their careers and, in the words of one executive director, have been \"empowered\". The centralisation of the past has been eradicated, it is also claimed. Persuading staff to sell is one thing but getting shoppers to spend is another, and, more importantly, spend at higher prices so that any rise in sales does not eat into profits. Finding more basic, classic items - like the black and camel leather coats selling at \u00a3190 - that customers will fight for must also be key. M&amp;S is selling \u00a3500,000 worth of such coats each week, a demonstration of the power it wields - when it gets it right. The problem is that when it gets its wrong the pain is big too. Lost sales from supply hiccups cost \u00a311m in sales in the first five weeks of the second half. Every sale counts in the current climate. M&amp;S does not look comfortable going into a cold, wet winter. Euro effects What a way to run a currency. Last Friday the European Central Bank moved into the foreign exchange market. It did the same again on Monday. It was, it said, concerned \"about the global and domestic repercussions of the exchange rate of the euro, including its impact on price stability\". Now, the FX market has still to make its mind up about the tactics and the timing of intervention. The ECB's statement, however, was at least consistent with the earlier G7 intervention and with the bank's stated policy priority. So what happens yesterday? Up pops Italian treasury minister Vincenzo Visco saying that the intervention was not driven by worries about inflation at all. Inflation was not a problem. Instead the bank's interventions were \"related to what [it] reckons to be useful to the euro and the signals on the currency level it wants to send to the market\". In the foot-shooting contest Mr Visco can make the claim of having scored with both barrels. Direct hit number 1: the only certainty central banks like to engender in FX markets is that they can and will intervene. What they usually try to avoid is giving the markets a target at which to aim - ie the exchange rate range it is either looking to achieve or wishes to defend. Direct hit number 2: whatever the policy, it is vital everyone sings from the same hymn sheet. FX markets interpret mixed messages as weakness. The euro is already weak enough.",

      "body": "<p>If you were to compile a list of programmes that viewers most wanted to bring back to their screens, the mid-80s comic drama about Geordie brickies seeking work in Germany, Auf Wiedersehen, Pet, would score pretty high, at least among voters old enough to remember it. Despite the fact that there's nothing remotely comparable to it in the current broadcasting schedules, Auf Wiedersehen clocked in at number 46 in the British Film Industry's poll of the Top 100 TV programmes of all time last September, one place behind Only Fools And Horses and, bafflingly, just ahead of Tiswas. </p> <p>What made the BFI poll intriguing was that it represented the views of the present-day controllers of British television, who show little enthusiasm for making the kind of programmes that they apparently consider to have been the backbone of British TV over the past 30-odd years. As one cultural commentator recently put it, today's TV toffs \"hark back to a golden age of classic programmes like Jewel In The Crown, Play For Today and Auf Wiedersehen, Pet - but they take fright at the thought of commissioning anything that might similarly delight today's viewers.\" Mal Young, the BBC's head of drama series, outlined the current orthodoxy in TV-thinking in his extraordinary Royal Television Society Lecture last year. A former Brookside producer and now in charge of EastEnders, Mal proposed that soaps are the all-purpose telly pick-me-up, offering drama, education, and social usefulness - oh, and ratings of course - to such a degree that \"they unify the nation\". </p> <p>Such people might find a germ of comfort from the news that the BBC is planning to bring back Auf Wiedersehen, featuring six of the seven original cast members (Gary Holton, Cockney geezer and ex-punk rocker, died during the filming of the final series in 1986), and that eight new episodes are already under construction by the series' original writers, Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais. When it was first screened in 1983, Auf Wiedersehen was made by Witzend for Central TV, but the BBC's Alan Yentob has been eagerly pursuing the idea of a revival ever since Franc Roddam, who dreamed up the idea in the first place, after his own experience of working on building sites in Germany, floated the notion of an updated sequel. </p> <p>At the start of the 80s, Roddam (a BBC veteran and the director of the movie Quadrophenia) had expounded his ideas about a bunch of itinerant British workers to Clement and La Frenais. The duo immediately warmed to the concept, but developed it beyond Roddam's original sitcom- ish notion and expanded it into a wider-ranging piece of drama, drawing in a broad spectrum of characters and social observations. </p> <p>With the precious gift of hindsight, it's easy to appreciate their enduring achievement as writers, but perhaps equally amazing is the strength of the cast of unknowns that was enlisted for Auf Wiedersehen, all of whom have been able to build impressive careers from the leg-up that the series gave them.

      "bodyText": "If you were to compile a list of programmes that viewers most wanted to bring back to their screens, the mid-80s comic drama about Geordie brickies seeking work in Germany, Auf Wiedersehen, Pet, would score pretty high, at least among voters old enough to remember it. Despite the fact that there's nothing remotely comparable to it in the current broadcasting schedules, Auf Wiedersehen clocked in at number 46 in the British Film Industry's poll of the Top 100 TV programmes of all time last September, one place behind Only Fools And Horses and, bafflingly, just ahead of Tiswas. What made the BFI poll intriguing was that it represented the views of the present-day controllers of British television, who show little enthusiasm for making the kind of programmes that they apparently consider to have been the backbone of British TV over the past 30-odd years. As one cultural commentator recently put it, today's TV toffs \"hark back to a golden age of classic programmes like Jewel In The Crown, Play For Today and Auf Wiedersehen, Pet - but they take fright at the thought of commissioning anything that might similarly delight today's viewers.\" Mal Young, the BBC's head of drama series, outlined the current orthodoxy in TV-thinking in his extraordinary Royal Television Society Lecture last year. A former Brookside producer and now in charge of EastEnders, Mal proposed that soaps are the all-purpose telly pick-me-up, offering drama, education, and social usefulness - oh, and ratings of course - to such a degree that \"they unify the nation\". Such people might find a germ of comfort from the news that the BBC is planning to bring back Auf Wiedersehen, featuring six of the seven original cast members (Gary Holton, Cockney geezer and ex-punk rocker, died during the filming of the final series in 1986), and that eight new episodes are already under construction by the series' original writers, Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais. When it was first screened in 1983, Auf Wiedersehen was made by Witzend for Central TV, but the BBC's Alan Yentob has been eagerly pursuing the idea of a revival ever since Franc Roddam, who dreamed up the idea in the first place, after his own experience of working on building sites in Germany, floated the notion of an updated sequel. At the start of the 80s, Roddam (a BBC veteran and the director of the movie Quadrophenia) had expounded his ideas about a bunch of itinerant British workers to Clement and La Frenais. The duo immediately warmed to the concept, but developed it beyond Roddam's original sitcom- ish notion and expanded it into a wider-ranging piece of drama, drawing in a broad spectrum of characters and social observations. With the precious gift of hindsight, it's easy to appreciate their enduring achievement as writers, but perhaps equally amazing is the strength of the cast of unknowns that was enlisted for Auf Wiedersehen, all of whom have been able to build impressive careers from the leg-up that the series gave them. Timothy Spall (who was nominated for an Oscar for his performance in Mike Leigh's Secrets And Lies) played Barry, the exasperatingly dull Brummie electrician. Kevin \"Sgt Lewis\" Whately played newly-married Neville, desperate to provide for his wife and future family. Tim Healy and Christopher Fairbank have become familiar faces across a broad swathe of British TV drama, while Pat Roach, who played Bomber the bricklayer, went on to specialise as movie villains in the likes of Raiders Of The Lost Ark and Never Say Never Again. Above all, it was Jimmy Nail as the violent, dour and bigoted Oz who stuck in the imagination, a portrayal as steeped in bleak 80s-style bitterness and disillusion as Bernard Hill's Yosser in Boys From The Black Stuff. The way that both series tapped unerringly into the spirit of the period, particularly as far as working-class northerners were concerned, was echoed in the way that Newcastle United fans used to taunt Liverpool supporters with chants of \"Oz is harder than Yosser\". Auf Wiedersehen's most significant achievement, apart from ratings reaching as high as 14 million, was the way it was able to reflect on the nature of British working-class life, from both a British and a foreign perspective, without letting often brutal dramatic events overwhelm its comic perspective.

      "body": "<p>Sitting in on a rehearsal at the Royal Opera House is a rare privilege. When it is Amanda Roocroft being put through her paces in Katya Kabanova, which opens at Covent Garden on Friday, it is something more than that. The power and commitment she brings to the rehearsal, throwing herself to the floor and ignoring concerned offers of knee-pads, makes you wonder how this performance can be topped on stage. </p> <p>Roocroft has become inseparable from Janacek's self-destructive heroine, who rebels against her oppressive marriage. She triumphed in the role at Glyndebourne in 1998 and has come to see it as the turning point in a career that had seemed to be going off the rails. \"The three years leading up to that Katya were bleak and empty,\" she says. \"I'm glad they're over.\" This unhappiest of operas has, oddly, become her lucky charm. </p> <p>In rehearsal, Roocroft appears to have boundless confidence: playing the role to the hilt; listening intently to director David Edwards and conductor Simone Young but having her always succinct say too; producing her throaty laugh when things go wrong. But talk to her and the confidence evaporates: she dislikes interviews, critical scrutiny, the whole ego-driven business of opera. </p> <p>Her crisis in the mid-1990s was part professional, part personal. She felt others' expectations were enveloping her and that her record company at the time, EMI, was interested only in turning her into a marketable commodity. Her marriage to German baritone Manfred Hemm was also on the point of breakdown. They are now divorced and Roocroft has married David Gowland, the vocal coach whom she met while rehearsing that life-changing Glyndebourne Katya. </p> <p>The break-up of her marriage clearly informed her playing of the role at Glyndebourne, but she says her understanding of what it is to feel repressed and alienated lies deeper than that. \"From a very early age I wanted to be a singer, and my friends didn't understand that. I always felt like the outsider and never really felt that I belonged in a group. If Katya were to leave her marriage and go off with Boris [her weak-willed lover], that relationship wouldn't last either. She is unique. She doesn't belong here - she doesn't belong anywhere.\" </p> <p>Empathy is crucial for Roocroft. She needs to get under a character's skin and says that her failures as Pamina in The Magic Flute reflect her inability to find anything of substance in the role. Katya is evidently someone with whom she feels a considerable affinity. </p> <p>Was it difficult reprising the role two years on? \"I rubbed out all the translation and musical notes and started again. I retranslated it, relearned it. I'm older now. I've seen more, done more. It's like an actor approaching a role he's done 20 times before. He would find new ways of saying the same thing.\" Roocroft also played Janacek's other tragic heroine, Jenufa, at Glyndebourne this summer, winning acclaim in a widely admired production. \"Katya and Jenufa are gifts for a soprano and for me, because I enjoy the acting side of it. What makes it more liberating is the language. Because I don't speak Czech, I have to convey emotions through sound. I have to act with my voice, and not knowing the language challenges you to do that.\" </p> <p>She is careful to draw a distinction between the two characters, both of whom are trapped by their domestic circumstances and dominated by powerful older women - Katya by her mother-in-law, Jenufa by her stepmother. \"Jenufa is more rounded than Katya,\" she says. \"Katya is on a one-way street to self-destruction, whereas Jenufa's is the journey of young girl to mature woman. She lives a lot along the way and is a big person, capable of tremendous forgiveness.\" </p> <p>The repression that both women suffer in closed, conservative communities can be difficult for modern, liberal-minded audiences to comprehend, but Roocroft understands the setting. \"I was brought up in Coppull, a mining village in Lancashire. It was very small and everybody knew everyone else's business. My mother was from a town 10 miles away and we were viewed with suspicion because we weren't born and bred in the village. It took 20 years to be accepted.\" </p> <p>Her parents were teachers, and her mother was a pianist who had put her family ahead of a potential career as a musician. Roocroft played piano and cornet - she was in the local brass band until she was 21 - but she always wanted to be a professional singer. She studied singing at the Royal Northern College of Music and was hailed as a rising star, but now believes that such instant recognition damaged her. </p> <p>\"I wanted to be a singer from the age of eight. I enjoyed the sensation of singing, exploring roles. But then people heard about me and I felt I had to live up to their hopes. At college, there's always a flavour of the month and it was me. I thought, 'OK, it's me; it'll be somebody else next.' But it continued after college. I was a young girl in the profession who had to earn her right to be there.\" </p> <p>She had some bad notices, both for stage performances and for her debut recital disc, and she reacted badly. \"There was one particularly unkind review of the recording, which I read in a taxi on the day of the launch,\" she recalls. \"I remember thinking, 'If I just stayed in this taxi and told him to drive, I could just go and get lost and never be found.' From then on, I was fighting constantly with my confidence.\" </p> <p>Her relationship with EMI ended, largely because Roocroft refused to play the role of diva. \"I didn't want to be a superstar,\" she insists. \"I wanted to do a good job and be respected in my profession for that. EMI couldn't understand that I didn't want to do interviews. I tasted stardom twice [first when she burst on to the professional stage in the early 90s, then when EMI promoted her] and I realised that it's not for me.\" She also resented attempts to cast her as a Lesley Garrett-style Lancashire lass.

      "bodyText": "Sitting in on a rehearsal at the Royal Opera House is a rare privilege. When it is Amanda Roocroft being put through her paces in Katya Kabanova, which opens at Covent Garden on Friday, it is something more than that. The power and commitment she brings to the rehearsal, throwing herself to the floor and ignoring concerned offers of knee-pads, makes you wonder how this performance can be topped on stage. Roocroft has become inseparable from Janacek's self-destructive heroine, who rebels against her oppressive marriage. She triumphed in the role at Glyndebourne in 1998 and has come to see it as the turning point in a career that had seemed to be going off the rails. \"The three years leading up to that Katya were bleak and empty,\" she says. \"I'm glad they're over.\" This unhappiest of operas has, oddly, become her lucky charm. In rehearsal, Roocroft appears to have boundless confidence: playing the role to the hilt; listening intently to director David Edwards and conductor Simone Young but having her always succinct say too; producing her throaty laugh when things go wrong. But talk to her and the confidence evaporates: she dislikes interviews, critical scrutiny, the whole ego-driven business of opera. Her crisis in the mid-1990s was part professional, part personal. She felt others' expectations were enveloping her and that her record company at the time, EMI, was interested only in turning her into a marketable commodity. Her marriage to German baritone Manfred Hemm was also on the point of breakdown. They are now divorced and Roocroft has married David Gowland, the vocal coach whom she met while rehearsing that life-changing Glyndebourne Katya. The break-up of her marriage clearly informed her playing of the role at Glyndebourne, but she says her understanding of what it is to feel repressed and alienated lies deeper than that. \"From a very early age I wanted to be a singer, and my friends didn't understand that. I always felt like the outsider and never really felt that I belonged in a group. If Katya were to leave her marriage and go off with Boris [her weak-willed lover], that relationship wouldn't last either. She is unique. She doesn't belong here - she doesn't belong anywhere.\" Empathy is crucial for Roocroft. She needs to get under a character's skin and says that her failures as Pamina in The Magic Flute reflect her inability to find anything of substance in the role. Katya is evidently someone with whom she feels a considerable affinity. Was it difficult reprising the role two years on? \"I rubbed out all the translation and musical notes and started again. I retranslated it, relearned it. I'm older now. I've seen more, done more. It's like an actor approaching a role he's done 20 times before. He would find new ways of saying the same thing.\" Roocroft also played Janacek's other tragic heroine, Jenufa, at Glyndebourne this summer, winning acclaim in a widely admired production. \"Katya and Jenufa are gifts for a soprano and for me, because I enjoy the acting side of it.

Along with Peter Brooks's forthcoming English-language production of Hamlet and the premiere of Yasmina Reza's new play, Life x 3, Adjani's return was this autumn's big theatrical opening in France. \"It's Isabelle Adjani's last chance,\" screamed a banner headline in Le Parisien newspaper on the eve of the show's first night last month. </p> <p>The 45-year-old star was to play Marguerite Gautier in the 1852 drama by Alexandre Dumas fils - taking the title role that had already been immortalised by Sarah Bernhardt and Greta Garbo. Adjani had been in nothing worth seeing since the 1994 film La Reine Margot. Did she still have what it took to captivate that old monster, le Tout-Paris ? Everybody was very excited. </p> <p>It wasn't just the length of her absence that made the return of \"la reine Isabelle\" (Voici magazine's term) risky. It was the fear that the 22m franc (about \u00a32m) production might collapse under Adjani's demands. \"Marguerite is one of those roles that excite the imagination,\" said Adjani in a rare interview with Paris Match earlier this year. \"I said to myself: 'This is a dream that I haven't yet realised in my career.' So when I was offered the part, I accepted at once.\" </p> <p>But, once she accepted the role, she was all over the production like a rash. Robert Hossein, artistic director of the Th\u00e9tre Marigny, was the person who had invited Adjani to play the role; but, after repeated clashes with the star, he threw in the towel in April. Alfredo Arias took over, some say at Adjani's behest, but he in turn came into conflict with the star. She wanted her say over set design. She didn't care for Dominique Borg's costumes, finding the dresses too heavy. She refused to have her name in lights outside the theatre. She wanted more famous performers in the production, while Arias preferred to cast actors not well known to the public. Adjani's reported daily fee varies between 60,000 and 80,000 francs (\u00a36,000-\u00a38,000), not quite what footballer Nicolas Anelka is being paid across town at Paris Saint-Germain, but still quite a few bob by most people's reckoning. </p> <p>Rehearsals were rumoured to be fraught, and more than one French newspaper dubbed her an icy diva, capricious and temperamental. According to reports, she was prone to tantrums that upset the rest of the cast. But director Arias said: \"She isn't capricious, just a perfectionist.\" She also fell out with her press officer after a story appeared at the \"wrong\" time. She declined to do a TV interview because she didn't like the host, and then refused to do promotional work for the play. She has even strictly controlled the release of photographs of the play. </p> <p>But perhaps Adjani's very reticence helped to make the production irresistibly intriguing. More than 50,000 tickets have been sold for 100 performances of the play, which runs until January 25; it is fully booked until Christmas. With Adjani refusing to furnish French journalists with quotations, they were thrown back on their own prose. And what amazingly gushing stuff that was. \"She's the greatest of our stars,\" eulogised Pierre Vavasseur in Le Parisien. \"What we love about her is her porcelain fragility and her refusal to be too easily broken.\" Olivier Schmitt in Le Monde was more measured: \"She is older, less pretty but more beautiful.\" On Saturday, Figaro magazine made Adjani its cover star. There she was, black hair centre-parted, steel-blue eyes facing down the reader, clutch ing a bouquet of camelias that vied with her ivory visage for the most white thing on view. And inside there was yet another bloke waxing lyrical about Adjani's charms. \"Isabelle Adjani is that actress who can cry for no reason. She has a red nose for eternity. A melancholy and droll being who can only play tragedy,\" wrote St\u00e9phane Denis. He went on in this vein for several paragraphs, before musing thus: \"In the 80s, when we were totally in love with her, we asked ourselves if she was the incarnation of pleasure or the incarnation of sadness.\" (Who is this \"we\", St\u00e9phane? No matter.) </p> <p>Figaro still hadn't done with gushing. On the next page, a theatre-goer called Joel Gabrielli had written an open letter to Adjani. \"How to describe the indescribable? How to explain an immense emotion, an immense happiness? How to evoke my indescribable joy?\" </p> <p>Never mind the rhetorical questions - is she any good on stage? To some extent, that's beside the point. Adjani unleashed her allure on French men a while ago and is still coasting on its momentum. Basking in her stage aura is all that a good many people in France seem to want to do. This is not to single out French theatre-goers. The same is true in the West End and on Broadway. When a big star hits the boards, no one cares what the critics think. Some people are just too big to be hurt by the critics, unless they really stink. And Adjani didn't stink, despite some misgivings by reviewers. Herv\u00e9 Gauville of Lib\u00e9ration wrote that she \"possesses an interesting vocal register. It allows her to descend one or two tones lower than the other actors, then to climb up again without warning. She uses this effect too often in a redundant manner, which cancels the effects of surprise. Predictably, she relies too much on her iconic power and not enough on the actor's resources.\" </p> <p>Gauville didn't care for the sets, either. And the rest of the cast wasn't very good. Perhaps the problem was the play itself. Proust argued in A la Recherche du Temps Perdu that only in La Traviata did the work become great art. \"Verdi gave La Dame aux Cam\u00e9lias the style which the play lacked. I say that not because the drama of Alexandre Dumas fils seems mediocre to me but because when a dramatic work touches popular sentiment, it needs music.\" </p> <p>True, perhaps, but the thousands who will leave the theatre enchanted after seeing the iconic Adjani perform will no doubt disagree. </p> <p>\u0095 La Dame aux Cam\u00e9lias is at the Th\u00e9tre Marigny, Paris (00 33 1 53 96 70 00), until January 25.</p>",

Now, at 52, an age when many of her peers have peaked, Lavery looks in danger of turning into a major British playwright. </p> <p>It began three years ago with a play called Goliath, inspired by Beatrix Campbell's book about the riots that exploded across Britain's housing estates in 1991. This tough and compassionate piece was the first indication that Lavery could do more than give us a jolly good time in the theatre. It was swiftly followed by Frozen, an agonising and tender play about a mother, a paedophile and a psychiatrist bound together by the disappearance of a 10-year-old girl, which won Lavery the Theatrical Management Association best new play award for 1998. </p> <p>This week Lavery is riding the crest of a wave. Behind the Scenes at the Museum, her adaptation of Kate Atkinson's story of a dysfunctional family, is playing in York, and A Wedding Story, a moving drama about marriage and the nature of love, opened at Birmingham on Monday night and will transfer to London in the New Year. </p> <p>So what happened? </p> <p>Lavery dates her late flowering to her mother's death three years ago, followed by her father's a year later. The misery of their deaths, combined with the earlier suicide of her ex-husband, whom she had married when she was young before coming out as a lesbian, made Lavery realise that she didn't have to joke all the time. \"I am by nature a happy person. I wake up smiling. I used to say to my parents: 'You didn't give me the Bront\u00eb upbringing to become a writer.' I didn't feel I could write anything but comedies.\" </p> <p>There is a wonderful scene in A Wedding Story in which the grown-up Sally and Robin express their resentment and bewilderment at having to act like adults in the face of the descent of their mother, Evelyn, into dementia and the inability of their father, Peter, to cope. \"I am not grown-up enough for this. I look sophisticated and handsome but actually I'm only six,\" declares Robin. \"I'm actually not old enough to do my own coat buttons up,\" says Sally. \"It's an outrage expecting two tiny children like us to cope with this.\" As with much of Lavery's best writing there is a terrible, unacknowledged truth behind the joshing: that as long as our parents are alive we refuse to really acknowledge that we are fully adult. </p> <p>\"My parents' deaths made me grow up in every sense,\" says Lavery. \"There is a release in death. You forgive the dead for all the things that seemed so huge and irritating in life. You think that was just small potatoes. It changes your perspective.\" </p> <p>There is plenty of laughter in A Wedding Story, a play that with its mix of comedy, tragedy, movie culture and popular song constantly seems to be heading for a fall but ultimately soars. But it is also deadly serious. At its heart is an examination of what it is to love and how much our love for each other is built on shared memories. Peter and Evelyn appear to have had a blissfully happy marriage but Evelyn's Alzheimer's destroys not only her brain cells but love itself. </p> <p>\"I thought this play was a clever disguise of my own feelings about love and death,\" says Lavery. \"But the rehearsal process has left me feeling ragged and raw. I didn't set out to write about myself but I've used the emotion, loss and grief in my life and found a story to excise and explain it.\" But she gives short shrift to anyone who thinks that the gay Sally, who is scared of commitment, might be a self-portrait. \"The characters are braver than me, wittier, better dressed, have nicer haircuts and behave much better than I would. This is not my life,\" she says. </p> <p>And, unlike the characters in A Wedding Story, Lavery has plenty to be cheerful about. \"I used to be so jealous of young playwrights who wrote brilliant plays and got lots of attention. Now I'm pleased I didn't peak early. Instead of doing my best work 20 years ago, I'm doing it now and I've never been so happy.\" </p> <p>\u0095 A Wedding Story is at Birmingham Rep (0121-236 4455), until November 25 and opens at the Soho Theatre, London W1 (020-7478 0100), in January.</p>",

I look sophisticated and handsome but actually I'm only six,\" declares Robin. \"I'm actually not old enough to do my own coat buttons up,\" says Sally. \"It's an outrage expecting two tiny children like us to cope with this.\" As with much of Lavery's best writing there is a terrible, unacknowledged truth behind the joshing: that as long as our parents are alive we refuse to really acknowledge that we are fully adult. \"My parents' deaths made me grow up in every sense,\" says Lavery. \"There is a release in death. You forgive the dead for all the things that seemed so huge and irritating in life. You think that was just small potatoes. It changes your perspective.\" There is plenty of laughter in A Wedding Story, a play that with its mix of comedy, tragedy, movie culture and popular song constantly seems to be heading for a fall but ultimately soars. But it is also deadly serious. At its heart is an examination of what it is to love and how much our love for each other is built on shared memories. Peter and Evelyn appear to have had a blissfully happy marriage but Evelyn's Alzheimer's destroys not only her brain cells but love itself. \"I thought this play was a clever disguise of my own feelings about love and death,\" says Lavery. \"But the rehearsal process has left me feeling ragged and raw. I didn't set out to write about myself but I've used the emotion, loss and grief in my life and found a story to excise and explain it.\" But she gives short shrift to anyone who thinks that the gay Sally, who is scared of commitment, might be a self-portrait. \"The characters are braver than me, wittier, better dressed, have nicer haircuts and behave much better than I would. This is not my life,\" she says. And, unlike the characters in A Wedding Story, Lavery has plenty to be cheerful about. \"I used to be so jealous of young playwrights who wrote brilliant plays and got lots of attention. Now I'm pleased I didn't peak early. Instead of doing my best work 20 years ago, I'm doing it now and I've never been so happy.\" \u0095 A Wedding Story is at Birmingham Rep (0121-236 4455), until November 25 and opens at the Soho Theatre, London W1 (020-7478 0100), in January.",

Experts believe it could shed further light on the earliest Egyptian dynasties.</p> <p>\"This is the first time we have found royal boats in the area, proving that the pharaohs used Abydos, not only Saqqara and Giza, as royal cemeteries,\" said Gaballa Ali Gaballa, secretary general of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities. \"It is a very important discovery which will change our perception of ancient history.\"</p> <p>So far, only one boat has been fully recovered at the site. Dating back at least to the First Dynasty, 3,000BC, it is 23 metres long, two metres wide and 75cm high, and was probably powered by up to 30 rowers. Though it is said to resemble the royal vessels of Khufu in Giza and King Senusert III's boat at Dahshur, it is thought to be hundreds of years older.</p> <p>Previously, the only indication that boats as ancient as the Abydos one existed came from paintings on the walls of tombs and on pottery dating back to 3,500BC.</p> <p>\"This means that royal boats date back definitely to the First Dynasty, not the Fourth, as was previously thought,\" Mr Gaballa said.</p> <p>But Zahi Hawas, in charge of the Pyramids plateau in Giza, begs to differ.</p> <p>He describes the find as \"significant and important because it is the first time solar boats have been found in Egypt\", but says that the vessels were meant to help the king battle against evil in the afterlife, not battle live enemies on the Nile.</p> <p>\"Solar boats are symbolic boats, buried next to the deceased to help him in the afterlife ... They could not have been used on the Nile.\"</p> <p>The ancient Egyptians believed that when a pharaoh died he would sail down Egypt's great river, along with the sun god, Ra. Traces of yellow pigment were found on the craft, suggesting that the boat was brightly painted.</p> <p>Although Mr Hawas expects more boats to be unearthed when excavations resume this winter, he discounts expectations that a total of 24 vessels will be found at Abydos, one for each hour of the day.</p>",

Experts believe it could shed further light on the earliest Egyptian dynasties. \"This is the first time we have found royal boats in the area, proving that the pharaohs used Abydos, not only Saqqara and Giza, as royal cemeteries,\" said Gaballa Ali Gaballa, secretary general of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities. \"It is a very important discovery which will change our perception of ancient history.\" So far, only one boat has been fully recovered at the site. Dating back at least to the First Dynasty, 3,000BC, it is 23 metres long, two metres wide and 75cm high, and was probably powered by up to 30 rowers. Though it is said to resemble the royal vessels of Khufu in Giza and King Senusert III's boat at Dahshur, it is thought to be hundreds of years older. Previously, the only indication that boats as ancient as the Abydos one existed came from paintings on the walls of tombs and on pottery dating back to 3,500BC. \"This means that royal boats date back definitely to the First Dynasty, not the Fourth, as was previously thought,\" Mr Gaballa said. But Zahi Hawas, in charge of the Pyramids plateau in Giza, begs to differ. He describes the find as \"significant and important because it is the first time solar boats have been found in Egypt\", but says that the vessels were meant to help the king battle against evil in the afterlife, not battle live enemies on the Nile. \"Solar boats are symbolic boats, buried next to the deceased to help him in the afterlife ... They could not have been used on the Nile.\" The ancient Egyptians believed that when a pharaoh died he would sail down Egypt's great river, along with the sun god, Ra. Traces of yellow pigment were found on the craft, suggesting that the boat was brightly painted. Although Mr Hawas expects more boats to be unearthed when excavations resume this winter, he discounts expectations that a total of 24 vessels will be found at Abydos, one for each hour of the day.",

Straight away Nesmachnyi wanders up the field and shoots into the side netting. 47 Cole, not looking totally up for it so far tonight, just fails to make contact with Sheringham's pull back. 50 United make pretty patterns as they move slowly upfield, but it takes Beckham rasper from 25 yards to make anything of it, Shovkovskyi palming over. the corner comes to nothing. 52 Another Beckham pop from distance fizzes wide. 55 Bodnar put down by Fortune level with the left side of United's box. the resultant freekick is headed over. 57 Game just limping along now, Kiev seemingly unable to liven matters up, United just unwilling to take any risks. 59 Kiev are apparently on a huge bonus if they can win this. Proof, at least, that not everything comes down to money, judging by the Ukrainians' showing. 62 Substitution for Dynamo, Kuzmichev replacing Gerasimenko. 66 Another move, Man Utd's this time, breaks down as Butt and Fortune get their wires crossed. Not a thriller, this. 67 Another Dynamo sunstitution, Shatskikh making way for Demetradze. 68 United awarded a freekick \"well within Beckham territory\". Said shaven-headed pin-up obligingly curls it into the crowd. 71 Kiev work the ball about the pitch without any real challenges coming in, but still fail to make any ground. United crowd making long overdue sounds of dissatisfaction. 74 United substitution, Yorke coming on for goalscorer Teddy Sheringham. 75 Good run down the left by Irwin earns a corner, but it comes to nothing. 76 Dynamo substitution, Fedorov replacing captain Holovko. 78 Dynamo come to life for a minute, Bodnar running at Irwin and pulling it square before Bialkevich's shot goes wide. Signs of life, though, maybe. 79 Cole reminds Shovkovskyi what he's there for, the Dynamo keeper smothering well. 81 Keladze gets goalside of Phil Neville and crosses hard, but ball drummed back out again. Home crowd getting the shakes though. 82 Dermetradze has added something to Kiev's play, and United are not helping themselves in idfield, either, with passes so often going astray. 83 Keane gives away a freekick out on the Kiev left. Cross has pace, but United deal with it safely. 85 Dermetradze misses an absolute sitter for Dynamo. Bodnar gets behind Irwin and crosses along the six yard line, but the Dynamo sub manages to steer it wide with Barthez utterly helpless. 88 The scare seems to have given United a bit of a jolt. A couple of good moves are followed by Butt going close after patient ball work by Yorke. 89 United's final substitution, Silvestre replacing Fortune, who was a sub himself. 91 With the crowd whistling for time, Brown nearly gives everyone a scare by heading back to Barthez with a pair of Dynamo strikers lurking. 94 Dermetradze hits a last gasp cross hard across Barthez's goal. The clearance comes back with interest, but no sooner is it charged down to safety than the referee blows for full time. United qualify for the next round.",

      "body": "<p>Keith Dymond had been looking forward to his retirement, swimming in the warm seas off Tenerife and writing children's stories. But at the age of 59, his plans crashed around him after he suffered a breakdown and was on the brink of suicide. The collapse was triggered by the loss of his job as a local authority manager. </p> <p>He hit rock bottom 18 months ago. Since then, he has rebuilt his self-esteem and self-worth and has a new job as an account manager for one of Britain's most innovative employment projects. And along with his new post, he says, he has rediscovered the will to live. </p> <p>The employment initiative in Cornwall that allowed Dymond to get back on his feet has received little national attention. But John Mahoney, joint head of mental health at the Department of Health, described it as \"fantastic\" after paying a visit during the summer while on holiday in the area. </p> <p>The initiative is called Pentreath Industries. It provides work experience, jobs and training for people with severe mental health problems in one of the country's unemployment blackspots. Part of its success is the way it has adopted a dual-track approach, developing operations which take advantage of Cornwall's popularity as a tourist destination while also offering training in office skills, computer literacy and desktop publishing at its own printworks in St Austell. </p> <p>Pentreath currently has 12 separate projects, including seven emerging social firms, dotted around the county. These include a guest house in Falmouth, with extra facilities for the disabled; Cornish World, a quarterly magazine for Cornish exiles; Pedals, a bicycle hire and restoration business; and Cornish Wood, a woodworking business making planters and birdhouses sold through the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. </p> <p>The success of Pentreath, a registered charity, has gone against all the odds. Only this year, Cornwall was made a priority area by the European Union and awarded \"objective one\" status in recognition of its ailing rural economy. The farming and fishing communities are still in crisis. Transport remains a huge problem in a county 120 miles long. Yet employment and training opportunities for people with severe mental health problems have never been better. </p> <p>People with schizophrenia or manic depression, who 11 years ago might have folded bandages - for nominal pay - as industrial therapy at St Lawrence's hospital in Bodmin, have set up their own businesses or found permanent employment after training with Pentreath. </p> <p>The charity was set up by Cornwall and Isles of Scilly health authority in 1990 as part of the care in the community drive. The number of trainees has since risen from 50 to 500. All have a history of severe mental illness and have been referred by community mental health teams. </p> <p>For Dymond, who was a \u00a322,000-a-year training manager for Cornwall county council, the charity offered him a lifeline after he lost his job in a management shake-up. He recalls: \"Those were the worst four months of my life. It was absolutely dreadful. </p> <p>\"I was given alternative work but I was left totally demoralised. What happened was unbelievable. I had a breakdown 15 years ago, but this was worse. I eventually cracked and ended up in hospital. There was no light at the end of the tunnel.\" </p> <p>He was forced to sell his luxurious, four-bedroom bungalow and find somewhere smaller. However, that has also proved too expensive - with the result that he has been forced to sell up a second time in 18 months and buy something smaller still. </p> <p>Dymond, who is receiving long-term treatment for severe depression, is philosophical after the trauma of the past two years. He says: \"My wife and I were really looking forward to going to Tenerife. That will never happen, but I went on a computer training course with Pentreath and I am now working again - something I did not think was possible a few months ago.\" </p> <p>Another success story is that of Neil, who wishes not to be identified, who at the age of 29 thought he would never get a job after spending long periods in and out of hospital. Last year, he realised his dream of working at the Lost Gardens of Heligan, near Mevagissey, after completing a national vocational qualification in environmental conservation and gaining a number of machine handling qualifications while a trainee with Pentreath. </p> <p>Mike Helliwell, senior gardener at Heligan, says: \"Neil's performance is entirely up to our expectations. His time-keeping and reliability are faultless, and he has some impressive machine-handling qualifications.\" </p> <p>Most Pentreath trainees complete one of 24 accredited courses at sites across the county. Training is also offered in horticulture and landscape design, with opportunities to work at Heaven Scent Nurseries, another emerging social firm at St Austell. </p> <p>Penny Robertson, Pentreath's chief executive, says: \"People who come to Pentreath often think they have no future. Mental illness is so destructive it takes away a person's confidence or self-esteem. The illness and medication not only take away a person's skill level, they also take away hope. At times, people can't control their thought processes. It is the final indignity. </p> <p>\"The first thing we do is sit down and talk to people at an early stage and identify something the person is interested in. We try to identify vocational aspirations and a route to achieve it. Sometimes we identify things which people think they want to do but aren't achievable. We try to achieve realistic perceptions of what people can do. If we don't offer the training required, we try to find it from another source.\" </p> <p>A good relationship with employers in the county has resulted in 40 companies offering training placements. Links are currently being forged with Cornwall College, which offers catering courses. It is hoped there will be an opportunity to provide on-the-job training at Trevaylor, the \u00a3250,000 Falmouth guesthouse which Pentreath bought with the help of a grant from the national lottery charities board. </p> <p>Grants account for almost 90% of Pentreath's income, which last year amounted to more than \u00a31m. A third of this was core funding from Cornwall Healthcare Trust, which provides backing for each trainee for three years. This was matched by a grant from the European Social Fund. A further 10% came from the lottery charities board, and 8% was generated from trading by the social firms. </p> <p>The charity has come a long way since 1990. During the past 12 months, 19 people went into full-time jobs. Yet there is still a waiting list of people with mental health problems wanting to join. Robertson says: \"Our work has only just begun. We must expand our existing operations, establish new projects in some areas and extend our partnerships with local employers.\" </p> <p>For Dymond, who now works full-time for Pentreath, the charity has given him his life back. \"If it was not for Pentreath I would not be around,\" he says. \"I was given a step up just when I needed it. For that I feel very privileged.\" </p> <p><strong>Benefits and stresses of hard-edged projects</strong></p> <p>A store of unclaimed push bikes at Penzance police station was instrumental in the setting up of Pedals, Pentreath's bicycle hire business. The machines have been carefully restored by trainees who started work last autumn. </p> <p>The doors of the business were opened at Easter. With 40 bicycles and five trailers for hire at a prime site opposite the town's railway station, Pentreath hopes that Pedals may soon be a real money-spinner. Helen Field, project leader, says that as well as learning about bike restoration, trainees are developing their own route maps and guides. </p> <p>People with mental health problems are also involved in producing the quarterly magazine Cornish World. Out of print for a year, it was relaunched last December, and now has more than 1,000 subscribers worldwide. </p> <p>Field, says working in the commercial world means there is a \"hard edge\" to the business. Work can offer benefits, but also stresses. While some trainees had gone on to university or full-time work, others have dropped out. \"We are working in a commercial world, but we are also working with people who are ill, who might become poorly and need a break,\" says Field. \"If you imagine therapy as a swimming pool, we are the deep end.\"</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>There is no shortage of numbers when it comes to refugees and asylum seekers in this country. More than 70,000 people applied for asylum last year; there is a backlog of 100,000 claims awaiting a decision; and supporting asylum seekers has required local authorities to run up a claimed \u00a330m deficit. </p> <p>Strangely, though, nobody really knows how many refugees and asylum seekers are disabled. The Home Office and the departments of health and social security are unable to provide any figures, and even the new national asylum support service (Nass) does not know. Various academics and voluntary agencies have carried out small-scale surveys and the best, rough, estimate seems to be something more than 20,000. </p> <p>Keri Roberts, of the social policy research unit at York University, and her colleagues researching this issue, are finding that while disabled refugees and asylum seekers are among the most vulnerable people in Britain, they are usually not getting the right - or indeed any - support. </p> <p>One voluntary children's agency found, almost by accident, an asylum seeker family with an autistic child living in one room at the top of a bed and breakfast hotel. Nothing had been done about the child's needs. And even when refugee status has been granted, things are not necessarily any better. </p> <p>Sarah Merzouk, who works for the Refugee Housing Association, has been helping a newly-arrived refugee from Burundi who, although he understands English, is deaf and mute. As a refugee, he is entitled to benefits. But when Merzouk tried to help him obtain income support, she says the benefits agency insisted he apply for work, or jobseeker's allowance, without taking into account his need to learn British sign language. Merzouk says she is also having difficulty getting the local authority to carry out a community care assessment of his disabilities. </p> <p>Problems like these are commonplace, says Roberts. But some cases are especially upsetting. Miran Ahmad, coordinator of the Kurdish Disability Organisation, recounts several instances of asylum seekers physically and psychologically scarred by torture. </p> <p>It might be thought that on the first anniversary on Saturday of the Immigration and Asylum Act, the aim of which was to \"modernise\" and \"streamline\" the system, the plight of these most vulnerable asylum seekers would have improved. </p> <p>But the act made no specific reference to disabled people, although it did establish Nass, which is charged with organising vouchers, accommodation, and generally providing or arranging the necessary support for asylum seekers. Alison Fenney, head of policy at the Refugee Council, says Nass has so far failed to make any difference. \"In particular, there is a lack of interface between it and the community care system operated by local authorities.\" </p> <p>Many of the problems seem largely inbuilt. Disabled asylum seekers have to exist on vouchers, at 70% of income support rates, even though the government accepts there are significant and genuine costs associated with most disabilities. But refugees and asylum seekers are not usually eligible for disability benefits. Nor may the shops which take vouchers stock foods appropriate for people with diabetes, for example. </p> <p>Vanessa Davis, team leader at the Disability Alliance charity, says she and some refugee groups have been trying for most of the year to persuade Barbara Roche, immigration minister, to take seriously the costs of disability. \"But all we're told is that everything is decided on a case-by-case basis, so there's clearly no policy on the matter. Similarly, we've been asking Nass what they can do to provide proper support, and again we've received no answer.\" </p> <p>Davis also points out that the act's emphasis on dispersing asylum seekers from London and Kent has led Nass to prioritise its work on finding accommodation. This, she says, has marginalised issues such as assessment and support for disabled people.

The act's dispersal policy has added to the problem according to Alan Sklan, clinical director of the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture. \"Although in theory asylum seekers and refugees who have been tortured are not supposed to be dispersed, because it's recognised that here in London we can offer the necessary multi-disciplinary support, we're very aware that it doesn't always happen,\" says Sklan. </p> <p>\"The government should have planned for dispersal by building up regional centres which could offer proper services.

Geoff Alltimes, from the Association of Directors of Social Services' disabilities committee, says authorities are finding it hard enough to cope with accommodating asylum seekers and are simply unable to engage in the outreach and follow-up work required to identify and meet the needs of disabled people. </p> <p>As for health needs, campaigners cite many instances where GPs have been unwilling to place disabled refugees and asylum seekers on their lists - principally, they say, because they do not have access to interpreters. </p> <p>Fenney, at the Refugee Council, says: \"This is all a huge grey area, at both policy and operational level.

      "bodyText": "There is no shortage of numbers when it comes to refugees and asylum seekers in this country. More than 70,000 people applied for asylum last year; there is a backlog of 100,000 claims awaiting a decision; and supporting asylum seekers has required local authorities to run up a claimed \u00a330m deficit. Strangely, though, nobody really knows how many refugees and asylum seekers are disabled. The Home Office and the departments of health and social security are unable to provide any figures, and even the new national asylum support service (Nass) does not know. Various academics and voluntary agencies have carried out small-scale surveys and the best, rough, estimate seems to be something more than 20,000. Keri Roberts, of the social policy research unit at York University, and her colleagues researching this issue, are finding that while disabled refugees and asylum seekers are among the most vulnerable people in Britain, they are usually not getting the right - or indeed any - support. One voluntary children's agency found, almost by accident, an asylum seeker family with an autistic child living in one room at the top of a bed and breakfast hotel. Nothing had been done about the child's needs. And even when refugee status has been granted, things are not necessarily any better. Sarah Merzouk, who works for the Refugee Housing Association, has been helping a newly-arrived refugee from Burundi who, although he understands English, is deaf and mute. As a refugee, he is entitled to benefits. But when Merzouk tried to help him obtain income support, she says the benefits agency insisted he apply for work, or jobseeker's allowance, without taking into account his need to learn British sign language. Merzouk says she is also having difficulty getting the local authority to carry out a community care assessment of his disabilities. Problems like these are commonplace, says Roberts. But some cases are especially upsetting. Miran Ahmad, coordinator of the Kurdish Disability Organisation, recounts several instances of asylum seekers physically and psychologically scarred by torture. It might be thought that on the first anniversary on Saturday of the Immigration and Asylum Act, the aim of which was to \"modernise\" and \"streamline\" the system, the plight of these most vulnerable asylum seekers would have improved. But the act made no specific reference to disabled people, although it did establish Nass, which is charged with organising vouchers, accommodation, and generally providing or arranging the necessary support for asylum seekers. Alison Fenney, head of policy at the Refugee Council, says Nass has so far failed to make any difference. \"In particular, there is a lack of interface between it and the community care system operated by local authorities.\" Many of the problems seem largely inbuilt. Disabled asylum seekers have to exist on vouchers, at 70% of income support rates, even though the government accepts there are significant and genuine costs associated with most disabilities. But refugees and asylum seekers are not usually eligible for disability benefits. Nor may the shops which take vouchers stock foods appropriate for people with diabetes, for example. Vanessa Davis, team leader at the Disability Alliance charity, says she and some refugee groups have been trying for most of the year to persuade Barbara Roche, immigration minister, to take seriously the costs of disability. \"But all we're told is that everything is decided on a case-by-case basis, so there's clearly no policy on the matter. Similarly, we've been asking Nass what they can do to provide proper support, and again we've received no answer.\" Davis also points out that the act's emphasis on dispersing asylum seekers from London and Kent has led Nass to prioritise its work on finding accommodation. This, she says, has marginalised issues such as assessment and support for disabled people. In addition, Nass carries out its work in partnership with \"reception assistants\" - local voluntary asylum and refugee agencies seldom familiar with disability. As a consequence many slip through the net - though as Davis argues, in reality there may be no \"net\". The act's dispersal policy has added to the problem according to Alan Sklan, clinical director of the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture. \"Although in theory asylum seekers and refugees who have been tortured are not supposed to be dispersed, because it's recognised that here in London we can offer the necessary multi-disciplinary support, we're very aware that it doesn't always happen,\" says Sklan. \"The government should have planned for dispersal by building up regional centres which could offer proper services. Instead we have hard-pressed health and local authorities struggling to identify and meet the sometimes considerable needs of victims of torture.\" Most refugee and disability agencies accept that local authorities and NHS trusts have been put in a difficult position. Geoff Alltimes, from the Association of Directors of Social Services' disabilities committee, says authorities are finding it hard enough to cope with accommodating asylum seekers and are simply unable to engage in the outreach and follow-up work required to identify and meet the needs of disabled people. As for health needs, campaigners cite many instances where GPs have been unwilling to place disabled refugees and asylum seekers on their lists - principally, they say, because they do not have access to interpreters. Fenney, at the Refugee Council, says: \"This is all a huge grey area, at both policy and operational level. Many local authorities believe that Nass is, or should be, providing all the support, whereas Nass itself seems content to say to local authorities that, provided disabled asylum seekers meet their community care eligibility criteria, then local authority social services departments should provide the support.\" The real victims of this lack of joined-up thinking are refugees and asylum seekers themselves.

      "body": "<p>There is no river nearby, but last week the Brighton suburb of Bevendean was drying out after a flood. Carpets, sodden furniture, washing machines and freezers were being thrown into skips, mud hosed out of houses. People knew what to do; it had happened before. Four small dams meant to protect houses filled and overflowed. Muddy water, run-off from fields planted with winter cereals, had flowed down a normally dry valley and into the houses. </p> <p>But much of the damage resulted from flow from a different field - one that bypassed the dams; here a gully 1.5 metres deep and several hundred metres long had been cut by floodwater early on October 12 and discharged hundreds of tons of mud into houses and roads. </p> <p>Between 1976 and 1993, 60 incidents of flooding of properties occurred in the Brighton area. A substantial number will have been added in 2000. At Rottingdean, 3km from Bevendean, in October 1987, around \u00a3400,000 of damage was done to about 30 houses, half of which was borne by household insurers. </p> <p>There is a pattern to the flooding: almost all incidents occur in the months of October and November; all involve run-off from fields prepared for, or sown with winter wheat. The fields are bare and even moderate amounts of rainfall result in muddy flows leaving the fields by way of gullies. Farmers often claim that these are \"freak events\" but this is nonsense - one farmer making this claim was asked when the previous case of flooding of the nearby village was, and he replied \"last year\". </p> <p>Over the hill from Bevendean is the well-known vineyard of Breaky Bottom. The farmhouse, built in 1827 in a dry valley was not flooded until 1976 and then again in 1982, 1987 and last week. The flood frequency has increased since the slopes up-valley began to be cultivated with cereals. </p> <p>Under grass there was no threat as there was little run-off and no erosion. A series of October floods in 1987 resulted in considerable damage to house and vines and a long-running legal dispute with undisclosed damages being paid to Peter Hall at Breaky Bottom. The case sought to prove that cultivation of steep slopes for wheat constituted a predictable risk of downvalley flooding; that it was done in the knowledge of that risk; that nothing had been done to mitigate that risk; and that land use and farming practices were mainly responsible rather than heavy rain. </p> <p>Central to the case, and others like it, is the assertion that it is how, when and where the land is cultivated, not the fact that it rains hard, that is the main cause of flood damage. Farmers thus have a responsibility to manage land wisely which includes being aware of downvalley risk of flooding. </p> <p>This is not only a South Downs problem, in other parts of the country where houses are adjacent to farmland the incidence of flooding has increased since the adoption of winter cereals in the 70s. Particularly at risk is the Isle of Wight, Devon, Somerset, Kent and parts of the east and west midlands. </p> <p>The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) have recently published a series of advisory booklets for farmers on \"Controlling Soil Erosion\". The \"soil code\" also devotes several pages to the risks of run-off and erosion. The risk of damage to properties and roads is clearly recognised, and farmers are told how to assess that risk. They are advised that if the problems are \"regular and severe\" to seek further advice and to consider switching to grass. The approach is voluntary, but at least the advice is freely available and farmers cannot claim ignorance. </p> <p>There are success stories that show that property can be protected from muddy floods. At Rottingdean, a deal between the farmer and his landlord Brighton borough council led to a reduction in the area of cereals and the construction of a substantial dam: there has been no flooding since 1987. </p> <p>At Sompting, near Worthing, after several repeat floodings of houses, the farmer constructed small dams and put areas of the basin under grass using set-aside payments. This has been effective and since 1993 no property damage has occurred. </p> <p>Such examples of good practice need to be more widely known. Similarly, in the southern Netherlands, Belgium and northern France, with histories of property damage by run-off, radical approaches involving cooperation between local communities and farmers and EU funding have started to make progress in providing protection. </p> <p>Recent media reports of flooding in south-east England have linked it to climate change. While there may be an element of exceptional rainfall, new developments on floodplains have clearly contributed to the catalogue of damage. Floodplains are meant to store water not to be cluttered with houses. </p> <p>Damage occurs where property is in close proximity to bare cultivated fields: these sites are quite predictable. Damage will not occur every year, but in relatively wet autumns such as 1982, 1987 and 2000. Farmers at these sites are engaged in a risk-taking activity (commonly called a gamble) and can expect to lose every few years. But the real losers are the insurance companies, the local councils and the householders: costs of damage to crops are minimal compared to those associated with the flooding of houses. </p> <p>Nothing has changed and we cannot blame the climate. </p> <p>\u0095 Dr John Boardman is head of the Environmental Change Institute, Oxford, and has worked on erosion and flooding problems for 20 years.</p>",

      "bodyText": "There is no river nearby, but last week the Brighton suburb of Bevendean was drying out after a flood. Carpets, sodden furniture, washing machines and freezers were being thrown into skips, mud hosed out of houses. People knew what to do; it had happened before. Four small dams meant to protect houses filled and overflowed. Muddy water, run-off from fields planted with winter cereals, had flowed down a normally dry valley and into the houses. But much of the damage resulted from flow from a different field - one that bypassed the dams; here a gully 1.5 metres deep and several hundred metres long had been cut by floodwater early on October 12 and discharged hundreds of tons of mud into houses and roads. Between 1976 and 1993, 60 incidents of flooding of properties occurred in the Brighton area. A substantial number will have been added in 2000. At Rottingdean, 3km from Bevendean, in October 1987, around \u00a3400,000 of damage was done to about 30 houses, half of which was borne by household insurers. There is a pattern to the flooding: almost all incidents occur in the months of October and November; all involve run-off from fields prepared for, or sown with winter wheat. The fields are bare and even moderate amounts of rainfall result in muddy flows leaving the fields by way of gullies. Farmers often claim that these are \"freak events\" but this is nonsense - one farmer making this claim was asked when the previous case of flooding of the nearby village was, and he replied \"last year\". Over the hill from Bevendean is the well-known vineyard of Breaky Bottom. The farmhouse, built in 1827 in a dry valley was not flooded until 1976 and then again in 1982, 1987 and last week. The flood frequency has increased since the slopes up-valley began to be cultivated with cereals. Under grass there was no threat as there was little run-off and no erosion. A series of October floods in 1987 resulted in considerable damage to house and vines and a long-running legal dispute with undisclosed damages being paid to Peter Hall at Breaky Bottom. The case sought to prove that cultivation of steep slopes for wheat constituted a predictable risk of downvalley flooding; that it was done in the knowledge of that risk; that nothing had been done to mitigate that risk; and that land use and farming practices were mainly responsible rather than heavy rain. Central to the case, and others like it, is the assertion that it is how, when and where the land is cultivated, not the fact that it rains hard, that is the main cause of flood damage. Farmers thus have a responsibility to manage land wisely which includes being aware of downvalley risk of flooding. This is not only a South Downs problem, in other parts of the country where houses are adjacent to farmland the incidence of flooding has increased since the adoption of winter cereals in the 70s. Particularly at risk is the Isle of Wight, Devon, Somerset, Kent and parts of the east and west midlands. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) have recently published a series of advisory booklets for farmers on \"Controlling Soil Erosion\". The \"soil code\" also devotes several pages to the risks of run-off and erosion. The risk of damage to properties and roads is clearly recognised, and farmers are told how to assess that risk. They are advised that if the problems are \"regular and severe\" to seek further advice and to consider switching to grass. The approach is voluntary, but at least the advice is freely available and farmers cannot claim ignorance. There are success stories that show that property can be protected from muddy floods. At Rottingdean, a deal between the farmer and his landlord Brighton borough council led to a reduction in the area of cereals and the construction of a substantial dam: there has been no flooding since 1987. At Sompting, near Worthing, after several repeat floodings of houses, the farmer constructed small dams and put areas of the basin under grass using set-aside payments. This has been effective and since 1993 no property damage has occurred. Such examples of good practice need to be more widely known. Similarly, in the southern Netherlands, Belgium and northern France, with histories of property damage by run-off, radical approaches involving cooperation between local communities and farmers and EU funding have started to make progress in providing protection. Recent media reports of flooding in south-east England have linked it to climate change. While there may be an element of exceptional rainfall, new developments on floodplains have clearly contributed to the catalogue of damage. Floodplains are meant to store water not to be cluttered with houses. Damage occurs where property is in close proximity to bare cultivated fields: these sites are quite predictable. Damage will not occur every year, but in relatively wet autumns such as 1982, 1987 and 2000. Farmers at these sites are engaged in a risk-taking activity (commonly called a gamble) and can expect to lose every few years. But the real losers are the insurance companies, the local councils and the householders: costs of damage to crops are minimal compared to those associated with the flooding of houses. Nothing has changed and we cannot blame the climate. \u0095 Dr John Boardman is head of the Environmental Change Institute, Oxford, and has worked on erosion and flooding problems for 20 years.",

      "body": "<p>As the fifth anniversary of the hanging of the Ogoni leader and environmentalist Ken Saro-Wiwa approaches on November 10, tension is once again rising in the Niger delta, as Shell attempts to return to Ogoniland, after an absence of seven years. </p> <p>It is a move vehemently opposed by Mosop - the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People - of which Saro-Wiwa was president. In April this year its congress announced that Shell, which announced record \u00a32bn profits last month, could enter Ogoni only to remove its remaining facilities, not restart them. </p> <p>Despite this, Shell announced last month that it wanted to reactivate its 125 oil wells in Ogoniland. Bobo Brown, Shell's PR manager in Nigeria, said that there was also a \"need to halt the pollution of the area, caused by the emitting of poisonous gases into the environment from leaking oil wells.\" </p> <p>\"We do want to get back into Ogoni,\" confirms Dave Stewart, a Shell spokesperson in London, \"but only when everyone is in full agreement\". This seems unlikely in the short term. In the five years since his execution, the protests that Saro-Wiwa and Mosop started have spread to other communities, spurred on by the grim reality of everyday life in the delta. </p> <p>For millions of people, there is a daily struggle to gain access to basic necessities such as clean water, health care and education. \"Ogoni people still languish in poverty, deprivation, marginalisation and environmental devastation,\" says Mosop. </p> <p>In contrast, in affluent north America and Europe, Shell has been trying to rebuild its tarnished image. It launched its \"profits and principles: is there a choice\" PR campaign, highlighting its commitment to environmental issues and human rights. </p> <p>The double page adverts are slick. As a beautiful African face stares out at you, the ad says: \"None of Our Business? Or the Heart of Our Business: Human Rights. It's not the usual business priority. At Shell, we are committed to support fundamental human rights ...

      "bodyText": "As the fifth anniversary of the hanging of the Ogoni leader and environmentalist Ken Saro-Wiwa approaches on November 10, tension is once again rising in the Niger delta, as Shell attempts to return to Ogoniland, after an absence of seven years. It is a move vehemently opposed by Mosop - the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People - of which Saro-Wiwa was president. In April this year its congress announced that Shell, which announced record \u00a32bn profits last month, could enter Ogoni only to remove its remaining facilities, not restart them. Despite this, Shell announced last month that it wanted to reactivate its 125 oil wells in Ogoniland. Bobo Brown, Shell's PR manager in Nigeria, said that there was also a \"need to halt the pollution of the area, caused by the emitting of poisonous gases into the environment from leaking oil wells.\" \"We do want to get back into Ogoni,\" confirms Dave Stewart, a Shell spokesperson in London, \"but only when everyone is in full agreement\". This seems unlikely in the short term. In the five years since his execution, the protests that Saro-Wiwa and Mosop started have spread to other communities, spurred on by the grim reality of everyday life in the delta. For millions of people, there is a daily struggle to gain access to basic necessities such as clean water, health care and education. \"Ogoni people still languish in poverty, deprivation, marginalisation and environmental devastation,\" says Mosop. In contrast, in affluent north America and Europe, Shell has been trying to rebuild its tarnished image. It launched its \"profits and principles: is there a choice\" PR campaign, highlighting its commitment to environmental issues and human rights. The double page adverts are slick. As a beautiful African face stares out at you, the ad says: \"None of Our Business? Or the Heart of Our Business: Human Rights. It's not the usual business priority. At Shell, we are committed to support fundamental human rights ... We invest in the communities around us to create new opportunities and growth.\" \"When Shell says that it respects human rights I do not believe them,\" responds Ike Okonta, from Environmental Rights Action, the Nigerian Friends of the Earth. \"You cannot devolve the environmental wellbeing of a people from the general conception of human rights.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>There are more than 185,000 registered charities in England and Wales. The number is rising by 5,000 a year. As you read this, another charity will be created somewhere in the country. The charity commission lists 620 cancer charities alone and more than 200 charities working with homeless people just in London. </p> <p>No wonder 70% of the public think there are too many charities doing similar work and competing with each other, according to new ICM opinion poll figures. The poll was carried out for the Media Trust, which, with the support of the Guardian, is today staging a debate on charity proliferation and duplication, asking whether confidence in the sector is being crucially undermined. </p> <p>Gordon McVie, director general of Cancer Research Campaign (CRC), the second largest cancer charity, openly acknowledges that the public is confused by the sheer number of charities. He warns: \"Out of confusion mistrust is bred, and the charity sector only functions because of trust.\" Numerous small cancer research charities, he claims, end up granting funds to scientists whose requests for funding CRC has turned down. \"Something has to be done,\" he says. </p> <p>However McVie takes a different view on the idea of the big four cancer charities merging. It would be inappropriate, he says, for CRC and the Imperial Cancer Research Fund to merge with cancer care charities Marie Curie Cancer Care and Macmillan Cancer Relief. As for having one cancer research outfit, he insists that they already jointly fund research projects running to several million pounds. \"Research suggests that we raise more money separately and that volunteers and donors are loyal to a brand,\" McVie says. </p> <p>Yet using fundraising to justify charities' existence can be a vicious circle. As the number of charities continues to grow, so does competition for funds - resulting in more aggressive marketing and fundraising techniques which further undermine public confidence. </p> <p>The public rightly believes that charities are spending more charitable funds trying to get them to part with their money. A study of leading cancer charities by Manchester Business School found that, in 1997, just 65% of money raised was spent on the cause, compared to 90% in 1992.

      "bodyText": "There are more than 185,000 registered charities in England and Wales. The number is rising by 5,000 a year. As you read this, another charity will be created somewhere in the country. The charity commission lists 620 cancer charities alone and more than 200 charities working with homeless people just in London. No wonder 70% of the public think there are too many charities doing similar work and competing with each other, according to new ICM opinion poll figures. The poll was carried out for the Media Trust, which, with the support of the Guardian, is today staging a debate on charity proliferation and duplication, asking whether confidence in the sector is being crucially undermined. Gordon McVie, director general of Cancer Research Campaign (CRC), the second largest cancer charity, openly acknowledges that the public is confused by the sheer number of charities. He warns: \"Out of confusion mistrust is bred, and the charity sector only functions because of trust.\" Numerous small cancer research charities, he claims, end up granting funds to scientists whose requests for funding CRC has turned down. \"Something has to be done,\" he says. However McVie takes a different view on the idea of the big four cancer charities merging. It would be inappropriate, he says, for CRC and the Imperial Cancer Research Fund to merge with cancer care charities Marie Curie Cancer Care and Macmillan Cancer Relief. As for having one cancer research outfit, he insists that they already jointly fund research projects running to several million pounds. \"Research suggests that we raise more money separately and that volunteers and donors are loyal to a brand,\" McVie says. Yet using fundraising to justify charities' existence can be a vicious circle. As the number of charities continues to grow, so does competition for funds - resulting in more aggressive marketing and fundraising techniques which further undermine public confidence. The public rightly believes that charities are spending more charitable funds trying to get them to part with their money. A study of leading cancer charities by Manchester Business School found that, in 1997, just 65% of money raised was spent on the cause, compared to 90% in 1992. Across all charities, the average was 67% spent on charitable causes in 1997, compared to 80% five years earlier. Despite a number of successful charity mergers this year - producing amalgamated organisations such as Parentline Plus and Alone in London - charities expert Moira Guthrie warns that mergers are no panacea. \"They eat up time and money in the short term, services can suffer and they are not a guaranteed success,\" says Guthrie, author of Mix, Match, Merge?, a study of the issues involved.

      "body": "<p>Chancellor Gordon Brown delivered his \"mini-Budget\" today which, as anticipated, gave extra cash to pensioners and motorists.</p> <p><b>Transport</b></p> <p>Mr Brown announced a freeze in fuel duty and a cut of 3p per litre in \"green\" ultra-low sulphur petrol (ULSP) and diesel, which he said would be available in every garage next year.</p> <p>Mr Brown told MPs in his pre-budget statement in the Commons: \"I recognise and I understand the very genuine concerns of motorists and hauliers.\"</p> <p>The chancellor said 1.5p per litre would normally have been added to petrol and diesel from Budget day next year, raising \u00a3560m - which he would now forgo by cancelling the planned increase.</p> <p>He said the move followed a successful experiment with low sulphur diesel which would now be extended to petrol. Mr Brown stressed this was part of the government meeting its environmental obligations, as well as addressing motorists' concerns.</p> <p>He said he now expected ULSP to make up 100% of the market next year, and after announcing other changes to excise duties said his total package of help to motorists was equivalent to 4p a litre off fuel duty and for hauliers was worth 8p per litre off diesel.</p> <p>The chancellor's gamble was that his announcements would be enough to head off another fuel blockade like the one in September which crippled fuel supplies.

      "bodyText": "Chancellor Gordon Brown delivered his \"mini-Budget\" today which, as anticipated, gave extra cash to pensioners and motorists. Transport Mr Brown announced a freeze in fuel duty and a cut of 3p per litre in \"green\" ultra-low sulphur petrol (ULSP) and diesel, which he said would be available in every garage next year. Mr Brown told MPs in his pre-budget statement in the Commons: \"I recognise and I understand the very genuine concerns of motorists and hauliers.\" The chancellor said 1.5p per litre would normally have been added to petrol and diesel from Budget day next year, raising \u00a3560m - which he would now forgo by cancelling the planned increase. He said the move followed a successful experiment with low sulphur diesel which would now be extended to petrol. Mr Brown stressed this was part of the government meeting its environmental obligations, as well as addressing motorists' concerns. He said he now expected ULSP to make up 100% of the market next year, and after announcing other changes to excise duties said his total package of help to motorists was equivalent to 4p a litre off fuel duty and for hauliers was worth 8p per litre off diesel. The chancellor's gamble was that his announcements would be enough to head off another fuel blockade like the one in September which crippled fuel supplies. He said that overall his changes on fuel and excise duty for cars and lorries would cost \u00a31bn. A 'Brit disc' scheme to charge foreign lorries for using British roads because they escape paying Britain's high rates of vehicle excise duty will be introduced, Mr Brown said. Some British lorries will pay \u00a32,000 less in excise duty. Pensions In response to pensioners' protests, Mr Brown declared: \"I have decided that the transitional arrangements should ensure that over the next two years pensioner incomes should rise faster than inflation and indeed faster than earnings. \"So from next April we propose that for the single pensioner there should be a cash increase of \u00a35-a-week and for a married couple a rise of \u00a38-a-week.\" There would be a further rise over the next two years to equal a rise of \u00a38-a-week for a single person and \u00a312.80 for couples. The economy Mr Brown also promised to deliver the \"lowest direct tax burden for 30 years\" for Britain's hard-working families. He told MPs that he would introduce targeted tax cuts to improve stability, productivity and long-term viability in the British economy. \"We want to see all citizens sharing in rising prosperity,\" added Mr Brown, with the country achieving American-style productivity rates. He announced consultations on three major corporation taxes to boost business, dealing with third-party savings taxes and other levies on profits. But Mr Brown, addressing a packed Commons, stressed: \"We will do nothing to put at risk the economic stability that has given this country lower unemployment\" and achieved higher investment in public services such as education and health. A raft of measures to improve the business climate was then announced by Mr Brown, alongside measures to aid savers. The tax-free limit for ISA tax-free accounts was set, for example, at \u00a37,000 instead of \u00a35,000 for the next five years. Mr Brown also promised a \"radical reform\" of tax incentives to help businesses start up and grow in inner city areas. Education A \u00a3200m boost for school building repairs was also announced. Headteachers will be free to spend the money on things like redecorating classrooms, new boilers or library facilities, Mr Brown said. It will be handed out directly to many schools in the next few weeks in order to save on red tape, said the Department for Education and Employment. In September, the education secretary, David Blunkett, announced at the Labour Party Conference that \u00a37.8 billion would be spent on renewing more than 7,500 schools in England. The money announced today will be going to schools around the UK although most of it - up to \u00a3170m - is set to be spent in England. Other main points: \u0095 Winter allowance up from \u00a3150 to \u00a3200 this year \u0095 Inflation within 2.5% target \u0095 250,000 young people have moved from welfare to work \u0095 Manufacturing to grow next year by 2% to 2.5% \u0095 Exports to grow next year 7%-7.5% \u0095 Growth next year predicted at 2.25%-2.75% \u0095 Proposals to simplify VAT \u0095 Extra tax relief on share options for e-commerce companies \u0095 \"Lowest family tax burden for 30 years\" \u0095 ISA's tax free limit up \u00a32000-\u00a33000 \u0095 Stamp duty exemption in poor areas \u0095 New Deal available to 150,000 more lone parents \u0095 Government will have \u00a316.6bn surplus this year \u0095 Government forecasts \u00a316bn in 2001-2002 \u0095 Government forecasts \u00a316bn for 2002-2003 \u0095 Government says debt ratio will drop to 30% The speech in full Part 1: the economy Part 2: the fiscal stance Part 3: families and pensioners Related stories 8 November 2000: Pensioners call at No 10 - Guardian 8 November 2000, explained: the pre-budget report 8 November 2000, analysis: My friends the truckers, by Leanda de Lisle Related special report: welfare reform Related special report: New Labour in power Related special report: the petrol war Useful links Campaign - People's Fuel Lobby Key player - the Road Haulage Association Key player - Freight Taxes.com Key player - National pensioners convention Budgets and pre-budgets since 1994 - HM Treasury",

The chancellor introduced it as a stepping-stone between full Budgets, given each spring. The statement provides a progress report on what has been achieved so far, gives an update on the state of the economy and the government finances, and sets out the direction of government policy in the run up to the spring Budget. <p><b>How does it differ from the Budget?</b><br> The Treasury's intention was that the pre-Budget report would be an informal announcement of the long-term things the government planned to do, rather than a specific set of formal policy announcements - that task was left to the Budget. In his first report to the Commons, the chancellor went out of his way to explain that he wanted to hear people disagree with his suggestions. \"My aim,\" he said, \"is to begin a national debate on the major economic issues we face. For too long in the past, Britain has lacked a shared sense of common economic purpose. I want to encourage an open discussion of the economic problems we will all have to address and the possible solutions that are open to us to secure our long-term economic future.\" The government even set up a roadshow afterwards in the hope of sparking a national debate that would shape the spring 1998 Budget.</p> <p><b>Did it work out like this? </b><br> Not really. In recent years, the pre-Budget report has come to be seen as a second Budget, rather than a broad-brush analysis of long-term economic planning. Ideas such as the roadshow and national debate seem to have gone out of the window.</p> <p><b>Why? </b><br> Partly because the media treats all the chancellor's announcements as firm policy proposals, meaning he has to take care in the report not to stray from the government's established economic agenda. There is little room for the broad-brush discussion that the chancellor hoped to achieve. And partly, too, because the government has been unwilling to talk about the key long-term economic issue facing Britain - the euro. In the absence of that, the pre-Budget report has been filled with more immediate issues.</p> <p><b>So what will this week's report say? </b><br> Much of it has been revealed to the press, so the report is unlikely to be a surprise. It will focus on two issues, both of which have been causing the government political problems. The first, the cost of motoring, which led to protests earlier this year, will be addressed by freezing tax increases on petrol and possibly by offering some sort of rebate on vehicle excise duty. The second political issue, the level of the state pension, will probably be addressed by offering pensioners a one-off above inflation rise in the state pension of \u00a35 a week.</p> <p><b>Will these moves be popular? </b><br> Yes - but it is not clear whether they will be enough to silence protests. Pensioners want their pensions to be linked to the national rise in earnings and drivers want fuel taxes to be cut, rather than simply frozen. The government's willingness to meet both sets of demands halfway may not be the end of the story.</p> <p><b>Related special report</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/budget2000/0,2759,181262,00.html\" target=\"_new\">Budget 2000</a> </p> <p> <b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\" http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget2000/budgetgu.html\" target=\"_new\">HM Treasury: a Budget guide </a> <br><a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget/1999/index.html\" target=\"_new\">HM Treasury Budgets and pre-Budgets since 1994</a></p>",

There is little room for the broad-brush discussion that the chancellor hoped to achieve. And partly, too, because the government has been unwilling to talk about the key long-term economic issue facing Britain - the euro. In the absence of that, the pre-Budget report has been filled with more immediate issues. So what will this week's report say? Much of it has been revealed to the press, so the report is unlikely to be a surprise. It will focus on two issues, both of which have been causing the government political problems. The first, the cost of motoring, which led to protests earlier this year, will be addressed by freezing tax increases on petrol and possibly by offering some sort of rebate on vehicle excise duty. The second political issue, the level of the state pension, will probably be addressed by offering pensioners a one-off above inflation rise in the state pension of \u00a35 a week. Will these moves be popular? Yes - but it is not clear whether they will be enough to silence protests. Pensioners want their pensions to be linked to the national rise in earnings and drivers want fuel taxes to be cut, rather than simply frozen. The government's willingness to meet both sets of demands halfway may not be the end of the story.

      "body": "<p>In 1997 Britain had rising inflation, a deficit of 28 billion pounds, a national debt that had doubled and was at risk of repeating the old familiar stop go cycle.</p> <p>So, in this Pre-Budget Report - which will address specific and immediate concerns - we will do nothing to put at risk the economic stability that has given us the lowest unemployment for 20 years, the lowest inflation for 30 years, mortgages 4 per cent - 1,000 pounds - below the average of the previous 20 years, and a Budget discipline that has enabled us to cut borrowing and now invest more every year in hospitals, schools and public services.</p> <p>And this hard-won and newly-won stability now gives Britain an opportunity we can either seize or squander - the opportunity to achieve high and sustained levels of productivity growth, and so ensure long term prosperity not just for some but for all.</p> <p>Yet every time the British economy has started to grow - as in the 1980s - Governments have taken short-term decisions on tax and spending which have put inflation, interest rates and economic stability at risk.</p> <p>So, Britain has a choice - the choice that underlies this Pre-Budget Report.</p> <p>The risk for Britain is to repeat the 80s' mistake of taking economic strength for granted even when we still have a large productivity gap with our competitors and trying to run the economy at a capacity not yet achieved. Our choice - the choice of the Pre-Budget Report - is that we build economic strength by investing and through tax incentives encouraging a new generation of entrepreneurs.</p> <p>The risk for Britain is a repeat of the late 80s' mistake - claiming a surplus one year could fund tax cuts for every year and - by committing in tax what was yet to be earned - stoking up an unsustainable consumer boom, forcing interest and mortgage rates to rise. We will take no risks with stability. Our choice - the choice of the Pre-Budget Report - is to lock in stability by - as I will announce today - prudently cutting debt and debt interest payments to keep inflation and interest rates low.</p> <p>The risk for Britain would be to cut investment in education and our infrastructure and perpetuate decades of neglect and undermine our economy. This Pre-Budget Report makes a different choice: to move forward with our three year spending plans that will double public investment - from education and health, to transport, policing, and the environment - and by continuing to cut both debt interest and unemployment, combining public spending with targeted tax cuts to do more for pensioners and, as I will show, give families the lowest direct tax burden for 30 years.</p> <p>So, this Pre-Budget Statement sets out a balanced approach - first stability and prudence to keep interest rates low, second tackling under-investment and then, when it is affordable to do so, targeted tax cuts for the Nation's priorities.</p> <p>Let me turn first to the forecasts for the economy.</p> <p>Since 1997 our first and most fundamental economic choice has been, through Bank of England independence, tough controls on public spending and difficult decisions on tax, to build economic stability.</p> <p>There were those in this House who predicted our policies would bring recession. I can report to the House that this year:</p> <p>\u0095 inflation is meeting its 2.5 per cent target;</p> <p>\u0095 long term interest rates are around the lowest for 30 years, the same as those in Germany and lower than America;</p> <p>I can also report that the economy is forecast to grow by 3 per cent this year:</p> <p>\u0095 manufacturing - despite its difficulties - by one and a quarter per cent and exports growing by eight per cent;</p> <p>\u0095 consumer demand growing by 3.5 per cent with living standards rising;</p> <p>\u0095 and business investment which has grown by 1.5 per cent as we lock in a higher level of investment as a share of our economy, 14.5 per cent, than at any time in 40 years, a bigger share of our economy than of the American economy;</p> <p>\u0095 and in total, fixed investment has this year grown by two and a half per cent;</p> <p>\u0095 with 1.1 million more men and women in work than in 1997, Britain now has the lowest unemployment since 1979, the lowest long term unemployment since 1978, the lowest youth unemployment since 1975;</p> <p>\u0095 the highest employment ever among women;</p> <p>\u0095 unemployment now lower in every region. With today one million vacancies spread across the country.</p> <p>And this month we plan to reach our promised target: 250,000 young people from Welfare to Work.</p> <p>And it is precisely because we have taken the trouble to build the long term foundation for success, and precisely because we have resisted short termism that would threaten stability in interest rates that I can report that, even in times of uncertainty for the world economy over oil prices and exchange rates, the Treasury forecast for next year is that:</p> <p>\u0095 inflation will meet its target of 2.5 per cent;</p> <p>\u0095 manufacturing will grow by between two and two and a quarter per cent;</p> <p>\u0095 exports will grow by between 7 and 7.5 per cent;</p> <p>\u0095 growth will range from two and a quarter to two and three quarter per cent;</p> <p>\u0095 consumer demand will grow by two and a quarter to two and a half per cent;</p> <p>\u0095 business investment by 1.5 to 2 per cent; and</p> <p>\u0095 total investment by four and a quarter to four and a half per cent.</p> <p>There were those who predicted our public spending plans would lead to higher inflation and that the economy would run out of control:</p> <p>\u0095 between 1979 and 1997 inflation averaged 6.2 per cent;</p> <p>\u0095 since 1997 it has been less than half as much - 2.4 per cent;</p> <p>\u0095 interest rates from 1979 averaged 10 per cent. Since 1997 6 per cent;</p> <p>\u0095 mortgage rates from 1979, 11 per cent. Since 1997 mortgage rates an average of 7 per cent;</p> <p>Growth from 1979 averaged 2 per cent. Since 1997 it has been 2.7 per cent.</p> <p>So we have steered a course of stability, but we are not satisfied. Long term prosperity for all is our objective, achieving, in this decade, full employment, higher education for the majority of young people, sustained improvements in our public services and with an end to child and pensioner poverty, not just some, but all citizens sharing in rising prosperity.</p> <p>And long term prosperity for all depends upon us reaching American levels of productivity growth - and on removing the barriers - by tackling under-investment, skill deficiencies, resistance to new technology and restrictive practices wherever they arise: building a stronger enterprise culture open to all.</p> <p>So, today, as part of the Government's contribution to a new and necessary drive for higher productivity, I am proposing to encourage entrepreneurship and expand investment.</p> <p>To make Britain the best place in the world for multinationals to locate, we will build upon our cut in corporation tax from 33p to 30p - the lowest of all major countries, the lowest in our history - by consulting on three major changes:</p> <p>\u0095 to abolish from April 2001 the withholding tax, not only on international bonds, but normally on payments of interest and royalties between companies in the UK;</p> <p>\u0095 to relieve tax on sales of substantial shareholdings by companies;</p> <p>\u0095 and in line with the needs of the new economy, tax relief for intellectual property and goodwill, as we create the best modern environment for business in the world.</p> <p>I can tell the House that this year corporation tax revenues are 2.5 billion pounds lower than forecast.</p> <p>While it has been put to me that North Sea oil companies, earning higher profits from higher oil prices should be subject to special taxes, I can tell the House that I am determined not to make short term decisions based on short term factors. The key issue is the level of long term investment in the North Sea. And this will be the approach that will guide budget decisions in future.</p> <p>My second set of proposals help small businesses whose numbers have grown already by 150,000 since 1997. Last year we cut small company corporation tax - once 23p - to 20p and introduced a new 10p rate, an overall cut in small company tax bills of nearly 25 per cent. Today I am publishing for consultation with small businesses a set of proposals that simplify small business VAT and are of direct help to up to half a million small businesses.</p> <p>Capital allowances and tax credits to encourage investment have already saved over 800 million pounds to business since 1997, a third of a billion pounds to manufacturing.</p> <p>Because I understand the importance of manufacturing I will now examine, for the Budget, further incentives that help manufacturing: in particular the proposals from the CBI and EEF to extend the R and D tax credit.</p> <p>To help smaller high risk and e commerce companies recruit and retain the staff they need, we propose to expand tax relief for share options and make Britain the most attractive environment for e commerce. In future, all employees can benefit from our enterprise management incentive scheme - up to a company limit of two and half million pounds worth of share options.</p> <p>For the period to May 2000, I propose to make provision for companies to limit and settle their liability for national insurance contributions on share options.</p> <p>Having cut capital gains tax from 40p to 10p for long term investment, I now propose an even further widening of the scope of the 10p rate - to non-trading companies and to venture capital companies so that employees from all types of companies will benefit.</p> <p>To enhance the contribution of institutional investors, we will consult on the Myners Review proposals to reform the minimum funding requirement and to remove regulatory barriers to investing in venture capital.</p> <p>To expand savings generally and especially to double the number of low income families who save we will review all capital limits that deter savings. Already nine million ISA accounts have been opened, and 3 billion more is being saved by low income savers. The tax free limit for ISA savers has been set for next year at 5,000 pounds.</p> <p>I propose to once more set it at 7,000 pounds, a figure I shall set for the next five years.</p> <p>To build enterprise and balanced economic development across all the regions, public investment, including public private partnerships, we are proposing today regional development agencies have greater freedom to decide locally how money is invested to meet local needs.</p> <p>The rate of small business creation in high unemployment communities is still a sixth of the more prosperous areas, and unemployment is still twice as high. Future jobs and long term prosperity will come, not from benefit cheques or from the old subsidies, but by a radically new approach - encouraging economic activity and business development on the lines proposed by the Rogers and Cohen Reports.</p> <p>So, I now propose a radical reform of tax incentives designed to raise business investment in high unemployment areas by one billion pounds. I propose to introduce:</p> <p>\u0095 stamp duty exemption for all properties in our most disadvantaged communities;</p> <p>\u0095 accelerated tax relief for cleaning up contaminated land;</p> <p>\u0095 VAT cuts to reduce the costs of residential property conversions;</p> <p>\u0095 tax relief to bring empty flats over shops back into use.</p> <p>And to consult on:</p> <p>\u0095 further business rate relief for small business in assisted areas;</p> <p>\u0095 a new and generous tax credit for community investment;</p> <p>\u0095 the creation of the first Community Development Venture Fund.</p> <p>And to assist the upgrading of listed buildings central to community life in all parts of the country, I can also announce that we are today asking the European Commission to reduce VAT from 17 and half per cent to 5 per cent on repairs to churches.</p> <p>I have one further proposal for a special tax relief.</p> <p>We will not only continue to work for cuts in Third World Debt but now plan to do more to meet the international targets of cutting world poverty by half and cut by two thirds infant mortality which through preventable diseases carries off one in seven of the world's children before the age of 5.</p> <p>So, as one of a number of proposals that the International Development Secretary and I are working on to tackle child poverty, the Government will investigate a new tax incentive and spending measures to develop, cut the costs for and ensure the supply of anti-TB, anti-malaria and anti- Aids drugs - drugs that could save lives, tragically still unavailable in the poorest countries, but with the potential that must now be realised to reduce avoidable suffering and unacceptable deaths.</p> <p>I turn to Pre-Budget measures to meet our goal of full employment. In addition to making work pay through the 10p income tax rate, the new working families tax credit and the New Deal which some would abolish but which, as independent research shows, has cut youth unemployment by 40 per cent more than would have happened without it.</p> <p>The Secretary of State for Education and Employment and I will:</p> <p>\u0095 intensify coaching help for the 50,000 young people still out of work;</p> <p>\u0095 consult on introducing a new service that will help redundant workers move quickly into new jobs;</p> <p>\u0095 investigate how with tax free and in some cases free adult learning we can help upgrade fast changing workforce skills;</p> <p>\u0095 extend the New Deal for lone parents with our nationwide programme of choices starting next April and extend to a further 150,000 lone parents not on income support the opportunity to get back to work;</p> <p>\u0095 agree a new partnership with the voluntary sector to help those with disabilities who want work to get it, while with a 200 million a year additional package that the Secretary for Social Security will announce tomorrow improving the living standards of those unable to work and carers;</p> <p>\u0095 and for each area drawing up local full employment plans addressing all barriers to full employment in their local areas.</p> <p><b>The rest of the speech</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/budget2000/article/0,2763,394550,00.html\">Part 2: the fiscal stance</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/budget2000/article/0,2763,394552,00.html\">Part 3: families and pensioners</a></p>",

So, in this Pre-Budget Report - which will address specific and immediate concerns - we will do nothing to put at risk the economic stability that has given us the lowest unemployment for 20 years, the lowest inflation for 30 years, mortgages 4 per cent - 1,000 pounds - below the average of the previous 20 years, and a Budget discipline that has enabled us to cut borrowing and now invest more every year in hospitals, schools and public services. And this hard-won and newly-won stability now gives Britain an opportunity we can either seize or squander - the opportunity to achieve high and sustained levels of productivity growth, and so ensure long term prosperity not just for some but for all. Yet every time the British economy has started to grow - as in the 1980s - Governments have taken short-term decisions on tax and spending which have put inflation, interest rates and economic stability at risk. So, Britain has a choice - the choice that underlies this Pre-Budget Report. The risk for Britain is to repeat the 80s' mistake of taking economic strength for granted even when we still have a large productivity gap with our competitors and trying to run the economy at a capacity not yet achieved. Our choice - the choice of the Pre-Budget Report - is that we build economic strength by investing and through tax incentives encouraging a new generation of entrepreneurs. The risk for Britain is a repeat of the late 80s' mistake - claiming a surplus one year could fund tax cuts for every year and - by committing in tax what was yet to be earned - stoking up an unsustainable consumer boom, forcing interest and mortgage rates to rise.

So, this Pre-Budget Statement sets out a balanced approach - first stability and prudence to keep interest rates low, second tackling under-investment and then, when it is affordable to do so, targeted tax cuts for the Nation's priorities. Let me turn first to the forecasts for the economy. Since 1997 our first and most fundamental economic choice has been, through Bank of England independence, tough controls on public spending and difficult decisions on tax, to build economic stability. There were those in this House who predicted our policies would bring recession. I can report to the House that this year: \u0095 inflation is meeting its 2.5 per cent target; \u0095 long term interest rates are around the lowest for 30 years, the same as those in Germany and lower than America; I can also report that the economy is forecast to grow by 3 per cent this year: \u0095 manufacturing - despite its difficulties - by one and a quarter per cent and exports growing by eight per cent; \u0095 consumer demand growing by 3.5 per cent with living standards rising; \u0095 and business investment which has grown by 1.5 per cent as we lock in a higher level of investment as a share of our economy, 14.5 per cent, than at any time in 40 years, a bigger share of our economy than of the American economy; \u0095 and in total, fixed investment has this year grown by two and a half per cent; \u0095 with 1.1 million more men and women in work than in 1997, Britain now has the lowest unemployment since 1979, the lowest long term unemployment since 1978, the lowest youth unemployment since 1975; \u0095 the highest employment ever among women; \u0095 unemployment now lower in every region. With today one million vacancies spread across the country. And this month we plan to reach our promised target: 250,000 young people from Welfare to Work. And it is precisely because we have taken the trouble to build the long term foundation for success, and precisely because we have resisted short termism that would threaten stability in interest rates that I can report that, even in times of uncertainty for the world economy over oil prices and exchange rates, the Treasury forecast for next year is that: \u0095 inflation will meet its target of 2.5 per cent; \u0095 manufacturing will grow by between two and two and a quarter per cent; \u0095 exports will grow by between 7 and 7.5 per cent; \u0095 growth will range from two and a quarter to two and three quarter per cent; \u0095 consumer demand will grow by two and a quarter to two and a half per cent; \u0095 business investment by 1.5 to 2 per cent; and \u0095 total investment by four and a quarter to four and a half per cent. There were those who predicted our public spending plans would lead to higher inflation and that the economy would run out of control: \u0095 between 1979 and 1997 inflation averaged 6.2 per cent; \u0095 since 1997 it has been less than half as much - 2.4 per cent; \u0095 interest rates from 1979 averaged 10 per cent. Since 1997 6 per cent; \u0095 mortgage rates from 1979, 11 per cent. Since 1997 mortgage rates an average of 7 per cent; Growth from 1979 averaged 2 per cent. Since 1997 it has been 2.7 per cent. So we have steered a course of stability, but we are not satisfied. Long term prosperity for all is our objective, achieving, in this decade, full employment, higher education for the majority of young people, sustained improvements in our public services and with an end to child and pensioner poverty, not just some, but all citizens sharing in rising prosperity. And long term prosperity for all depends upon us reaching American levels of productivity growth - and on removing the barriers - by tackling under-investment, skill deficiencies, resistance to new technology and restrictive practices wherever they arise: building a stronger enterprise culture open to all. So, today, as part of the Government's contribution to a new and necessary drive for higher productivity, I am proposing to encourage entrepreneurship and expand investment. To make Britain the best place in the world for multinationals to locate, we will build upon our cut in corporation tax from 33p to 30p - the lowest of all major countries, the lowest in our history - by consulting on three major changes: \u0095 to abolish from April 2001 the withholding tax, not only on international bonds, but normally on payments of interest and royalties between companies in the UK; \u0095 to relieve tax on sales of substantial shareholdings by companies; \u0095 and in line with the needs of the new economy, tax relief for intellectual property and goodwill, as we create the best modern environment for business in the world. I can tell the House that this year corporation tax revenues are 2.5 billion pounds lower than forecast. While it has been put to me that North Sea oil companies, earning higher profits from higher oil prices should be subject to special taxes, I can tell the House that I am determined not to make short term decisions based on short term factors. The key issue is the level of long term investment in the North Sea. And this will be the approach that will guide budget decisions in future. My second set of proposals help small businesses whose numbers have grown already by 150,000 since 1997. Last year we cut small company corporation tax - once 23p - to 20p and introduced a new 10p rate, an overall cut in small company tax bills of nearly 25 per cent. Today I am publishing for consultation with small businesses a set of proposals that simplify small business VAT and are of direct help to up to half a million small businesses. Capital allowances and tax credits to encourage investment have already saved over 800 million pounds to business since 1997, a third of a billion pounds to manufacturing. Because I understand the importance of manufacturing I will now examine, for the Budget, further incentives that help manufacturing: in particular the proposals from the CBI and EEF to extend the R and D tax credit. To help smaller high risk and e commerce companies recruit and retain the staff they need, we propose to expand tax relief for share options and make Britain the most attractive environment for e commerce. In future, all employees can benefit from our enterprise management incentive scheme - up to a company limit of two and half million pounds worth of share options. For the period to May 2000, I propose to make provision for companies to limit and settle their liability for national insurance contributions on share options. Having cut capital gains tax from 40p to 10p for long term investment, I now propose an even further widening of the scope of the 10p rate - to non-trading companies and to venture capital companies so that employees from all types of companies will benefit. To enhance the contribution of institutional investors, we will consult on the Myners Review proposals to reform the minimum funding requirement and to remove regulatory barriers to investing in venture capital. To expand savings generally and especially to double the number of low income families who save we will review all capital limits that deter savings. Already nine million ISA accounts have been opened, and 3 billion more is being saved by low income savers. The tax free limit for ISA savers has been set for next year at 5,000 pounds. I propose to once more set it at 7,000 pounds, a figure I shall set for the next five years. To build enterprise and balanced economic development across all the regions, public investment, including public private partnerships, we are proposing today regional development agencies have greater freedom to decide locally how money is invested to meet local needs. The rate of small business creation in high unemployment communities is still a sixth of the more prosperous areas, and unemployment is still twice as high. Future jobs and long term prosperity will come, not from benefit cheques or from the old subsidies, but by a radically new approach - encouraging economic activity and business development on the lines proposed by the Rogers and Cohen Reports. So, I now propose a radical reform of tax incentives designed to raise business investment in high unemployment areas by one billion pounds. I propose to introduce: \u0095 stamp duty exemption for all properties in our most disadvantaged communities; \u0095 accelerated tax relief for cleaning up contaminated land; \u0095 VAT cuts to reduce the costs of residential property conversions; \u0095 tax relief to bring empty flats over shops back into use. And to consult on: \u0095 further business rate relief for small business in assisted areas; \u0095 a new and generous tax credit for community investment; \u0095 the creation of the first Community Development Venture Fund. And to assist the upgrading of listed buildings central to community life in all parts of the country, I can also announce that we are today asking the European Commission to reduce VAT from 17 and half per cent to 5 per cent on repairs to churches. I have one further proposal for a special tax relief. We will not only continue to work for cuts in Third World Debt but now plan to do more to meet the international targets of cutting world poverty by half and cut by two thirds infant mortality which through preventable diseases carries off one in seven of the world's children before the age of 5. So, as one of a number of proposals that the International Development Secretary and I are working on to tackle child poverty, the Government will investigate a new tax incentive and spending measures to develop, cut the costs for and ensure the supply of anti-TB, anti-malaria and anti- Aids drugs - drugs that could save lives, tragically still unavailable in the poorest countries, but with the potential that must now be realised to reduce avoidable suffering and unacceptable deaths. I turn to Pre-Budget measures to meet our goal of full employment. In addition to making work pay through the 10p income tax rate, the new working families tax credit and the New Deal which some would abolish but which, as independent research shows, has cut youth unemployment by 40 per cent more than would have happened without it. The Secretary of State for Education and Employment and I will: \u0095 intensify coaching help for the 50,000 young people still out of work; \u0095 consult on introducing a new service that will help redundant workers move quickly into new jobs; \u0095 investigate how with tax free and in some cases free adult learning we can help upgrade fast changing workforce skills; \u0095 extend the New Deal for lone parents with our nationwide programme of choices starting next April and extend to a further 150,000 lone parents not on income support the opportunity to get back to work; \u0095 agree a new partnership with the voluntary sector to help those with disabilities who want work to get it, while with a 200 million a year additional package that the Secretary for Social Security will announce tomorrow improving the living standards of those unable to work and carers; \u0095 and for each area drawing up local full employment plans addressing all barriers to full employment in their local areas.

It will fall from 20.3 to 18.6 per cent, the lowest level since 1972.</p> <p>But I believe in the coming Budget we can offer a larger tax cut for families. My aim is to increase the family tax cut to 10 pounds a week, in total a 520 pound a year tax cut, increasing families' incomes.</p> <p>And just as we are introducing a new system of child support based on the foundation of child benefit - but at the heart of which is the new working families tax credit - so too it is now time, based on the same principle, to raise pensioner incomes by a tax and benefit reform that will have as its foundation the basic state pension, and will have as an essential building block - like the working families tax credit - a new and generous pension credit.</p> <p>Our aim for pensions reform is both to end pensioner poverty and to ensure that all pensioners share in the rising prosperity of the nation.</p> <p>But in a new world of rapidly diverging pensioners' incomes - already 17 per cent of couples are retiring on more than 20,000 pounds a year, and this percentage grows year on year - and where, as a result, inequalities between pensioner incomes are as great as inequalities within the population as a whole - we will best meet our obligations to pensioners by a new approach.</p> <p>To plan for the future based on a flat rate earnings-linked rise paid to all, which would give exactly the same to those with incomes above 20,000 pounds as to those on middle incomes - and because the income support system would do absolutely nothing for the poorest - would mean that by the time today's 45 year olds were retiring, for every 6 billion pounds extra spent on an earnings link, 2 billion pounds went to pensioners with incomes above 20,000 pounds at today's prices, thus meaning less is available for the middle and lower income pensioners, who are our first priority.</p> <p>So, we need a policy that does most for those who need most and at the same time ensures that all pensioners - the very poor, those on modest incomes and the relatively comfortable - share in the rising prosperity of the nation.</p> <p>Let me tell the House what the new system, which will integrate tax and benefits and build upon the basic pension a new pension credit will look like in 2003, and then I will set out the transitional arrangements.</p> <p>First, for those in and at risk of poverty, we will radically improve the minimum income guarantee.</p> <p>I can tell the House that the minimum income guarantee, which was 68.80 pounds in 1997, is 78.45 pounds today, and will be raised in April by 14 pounds to 92.15 pounds. For thousands of our poorest pensioners, 700 pounds extra a year.</p> <p>I can also tell the House today that when the new system is introduced in April 2003, the minimum income guarantee will be set not at 92 pounds, but at 100 pounds a week, 22 pounds a week more than today. For the first time a single pensioner guaranteed at least a 100 pounds a week. And for couples a rise from 106.60 pounds in 1997 to 154 pounds.</p> <p>And every year after that I can tell the House that the minimum income guarantee will be raised in line with earnings.</p> <p>With the winter allowance a 32 per cent increase in income even after inflation - demonstrating our determination that no pensioner is left behind as this Government works to ensure that pensioner poverty is a thing of the past.</p> <p>More than 2 million will benefit.

They will do so at the point of retirement and whatever adjustments thereafter would need to be made only when circumstances change.</p> <p>But we have a second obligation - to millions of pensioners who, after a lifetime of hard work, have modest occupational pensions and modest savings, but receive nothing from the system on top of their basic pension and have until now been penalised, not rewarded for their savings. People whom we meet every week in our constituencies - and this Government is determined that people who have worked hard and saved all their lives should now receive more.</p> <p>Tomorrow the Secretary of State for Social Security's statement will outline the new integrated tax and benefit system - both the pension credit and the new pensioner tax arrangements.</p> <p>I said in the budget that I wanted the beneficiaries of the new credit to be single pensioners with incomes up to \u00a3100 and pensioner couples with incomes up to \u00a3150.</p> <p>I can now tell the House that pensioner couples with incomes below 200 pounds, and single pensioners with income below 135 pounds , many millions of pensioners, will receive the new pension credit.</p> <p>And I can tell the House that while the pension will rise in line with inflation, the new pension credit will itself rise in line with earnings every year.</p> <p>In this way, we will give recipients of the pension credit more than even the earnings link in the basic state pension would give them.</p> <p>The pensioners tax allowance will be set at April 2003 at an even higher level - 6,560 pounds for the single pensioner - and for the next parliament we propose the pensioners tax allowance also rises in line with earnings.</p> <p>For the vast majority of pensioners, the middle and low income pensioners of Britain, the new system will provide extra cash on top of the basic pension: sums of between one pound and 23 pounds a week.</p> <p>Achieving all our aims:</p> <p>\u0095 for millions of the neediest pensioners relief from poverty;</p> <p>\u0095 for those on modest incomes a reward for their savings and occupational pensions more than an earning link could offer them;</p> <p>\u0095 and ensuring that all pensioners can enjoy a share in the rising standards of living of the country.</p> <p>As we move to this new and better system the Social Security Secretary and I have decided that the transitional arrangements should ensure that over the next two years, pensioner incomes should rise faster than inflation and indeed faster than earnings.</p> <p>So from April next year we propose that for the single pensioner there should be a cash increase of 5 pounds a week and for a married couple a rise of 8 pounds a week.</p> <p>And I can tell the House that the following year we can also guarantee the pension will rise well above prices.

      "bodyText": "I turn now to specific measures of benefit to families and to pensioners. Mr Speaker, our aim is that not just some, but every child has the best start in life and that we halve child poverty in the coming decade. Families need help most at the time when parents are bringing up their children. And as we extend our new integrated system of child support -from 15 pounds a week child benefit for every child to a maximum of 50 pounds - our priority in the coming Budget is the new children's tax credit, a tax cut for families. This family tax cut, which replaces married couples allowance, will be paid on top of child benefit to around 5 million families at 8.50 pounds a week, worth 442 pounds a year. On current figures the proposals on which we are consulting would, if implemented, mean that overall the tax burden would not rise next year and I will achieve my aim of next year cutting the direct tax burden on the typical family below 20 per cent. It will fall from 20.3 to 18.6 per cent, the lowest level since 1972. But I believe in the coming Budget we can offer a larger tax cut for families. My aim is to increase the family tax cut to 10 pounds a week, in total a 520 pound a year tax cut, increasing families' incomes. And just as we are introducing a new system of child support based on the foundation of child benefit - but at the heart of which is the new working families tax credit - so too it is now time, based on the same principle, to raise pensioner incomes by a tax and benefit reform that will have as its foundation the basic state pension, and will have as an essential building block - like the working families tax credit - a new and generous pension credit. Our aim for pensions reform is both to end pensioner poverty and to ensure that all pensioners share in the rising prosperity of the nation. But in a new world of rapidly diverging pensioners' incomes - already 17 per cent of couples are retiring on more than 20,000 pounds a year, and this percentage grows year on year - and where, as a result, inequalities between pensioner incomes are as great as inequalities within the population as a whole - we will best meet our obligations to pensioners by a new approach. To plan for the future based on a flat rate earnings-linked rise paid to all, which would give exactly the same to those with incomes above 20,000 pounds as to those on middle incomes - and because the income support system would do absolutely nothing for the poorest - would mean that by the time today's 45 year olds were retiring, for every 6 billion pounds extra spent on an earnings link, 2 billion pounds went to pensioners with incomes above 20,000 pounds at today's prices, thus meaning less is available for the middle and lower income pensioners, who are our first priority. So, we need a policy that does most for those who need most and at the same time ensures that all pensioners - the very poor, those on modest incomes and the relatively comfortable - share in the rising prosperity of the nation. Let me tell the House what the new system, which will integrate tax and benefits and build upon the basic pension a new pension credit will look like in 2003, and then I will set out the transitional arrangements. First, for those in and at risk of poverty, we will radically improve the minimum income guarantee. I can tell the House that the minimum income guarantee, which was 68.80 pounds in 1997, is 78.45 pounds today, and will be raised in April by 14 pounds to 92.15 pounds. For thousands of our poorest pensioners, 700 pounds extra a year. I can also tell the House today that when the new system is introduced in April 2003, the minimum income guarantee will be set not at 92 pounds, but at 100 pounds a week, 22 pounds a week more than today. For the first time a single pensioner guaranteed at least a 100 pounds a week. And for couples a rise from 106.60 pounds in 1997 to 154 pounds. And every year after that I can tell the House that the minimum income guarantee will be raised in line with earnings. With the winter allowance a 32 per cent increase in income even after inflation - demonstrating our determination that no pensioner is left behind as this Government works to ensure that pensioner poverty is a thing of the past. More than 2 million will benefit. People will be able to claim by phone. They will do so at the point of retirement and whatever adjustments thereafter would need to be made only when circumstances change. But we have a second obligation - to millions of pensioners who, after a lifetime of hard work, have modest occupational pensions and modest savings, but receive nothing from the system on top of their basic pension and have until now been penalised, not rewarded for their savings. People whom we meet every week in our constituencies - and this Government is determined that people who have worked hard and saved all their lives should now receive more. Tomorrow the Secretary of State for Social Security's statement will outline the new integrated tax and benefit system - both the pension credit and the new pensioner tax arrangements. I said in the budget that I wanted the beneficiaries of the new credit to be single pensioners with incomes up to \u00a3100 and pensioner couples with incomes up to \u00a3150. I can now tell the House that pensioner couples with incomes below 200 pounds, and single pensioners with income below 135 pounds , many millions of pensioners, will receive the new pension credit. And I can tell the House that while the pension will rise in line with inflation, the new pension credit will itself rise in line with earnings every year. In this way, we will give recipients of the pension credit more than even the earnings link in the basic state pension would give them. The pensioners tax allowance will be set at April 2003 at an even higher level - 6,560 pounds for the single pensioner - and for the next parliament we propose the pensioners tax allowance also rises in line with earnings. For the vast majority of pensioners, the middle and low income pensioners of Britain, the new system will provide extra cash on top of the basic pension: sums of between one pound and 23 pounds a week. Achieving all our aims: \u0095 for millions of the neediest pensioners relief from poverty; \u0095 for those on modest incomes a reward for their savings and occupational pensions more than an earning link could offer them; \u0095 and ensuring that all pensioners can enjoy a share in the rising standards of living of the country. As we move to this new and better system the Social Security Secretary and I have decided that the transitional arrangements should ensure that over the next two years, pensioner incomes should rise faster than inflation and indeed faster than earnings. So from April next year we propose that for the single pensioner there should be a cash increase of 5 pounds a week and for a married couple a rise of 8 pounds a week. And I can tell the House that the following year we can also guarantee the pension will rise well above prices. There will be a cash increase of 3 pounds for single pensioners and 4.80 pounds for married couples. Over two years, a cash rise of 8 pounds a week for single pensioners and 12.80 pounds a week for couples. For pensions 2.6 billion pounds more each year, on top of more for health, education, transport policing and public services. Mr Speaker, those who would spend this money on tax-cutting should now tell us which hospitals, which schools, which public services they would cut. We have made our choice Investment, Targeted tax cuts. Keeping mortgage rates low More for pensions and families. A stronger, fairer Britain. Mr Speaker, I have one final announcement. I have had representations to abolish the winter fuel allowance and indeed abolish the free TV licence for over 75s. I have even received representations to abolish the Christmas bonus. I have rejected such options that would give with one hand and take with another. I can confirm that now and in future years the free TV licences will remain for the over 75s as we have promised. The Christmas bonus will continue and the winter allowance will be paid at 150 pounds. But the transitional arrangements to our new pension reform will not start next year, but can start this year, indeed they will start this week. I can confirm that cheques are being sent out from Monday that will be paid to every pensioner household in Britain. The winter allowance will not be paid at 150 pounds this year. Nor will it be abolished. For this year specially - the first year of the transitional arrangements - it will be paid not at 150 pounds, but at 200 pounds to every pensioner household free of tax. And I commend this statement to the House. The rest of the speech Part 1: the economy Part 2: the fiscal stance",

      "body": "<p>Mr Speaker, high productivity and rising employment depend not just on ending decades of under-investment and targeting tax incentives on our priorities, but on entrenching a low inflation culture that prudently keeps interest rates and mortgage rates as low as possible.</p> <p>It is because we have learned from the mistakes of the eighties and before that I can tell the House that - in spite of demands made to me - I have decided - in the interests of keeping interest rates and mortgage rates as low as possible - to lock in, over the coming years, a fiscal stance that is the same or is tighter than we said at the time of the Budget.</p> <p>Let me give the House the background and the full financial figures.</p> <p>Our first fiscal rule - the golden rule, the first rule necessary to keep interest rates and mortgage rates as low as possible - is that over the cycle there must be a current surplus. So however tempting it may be for some to identify large temporary surpluses as an excuse for permanent injections of resources into the economy, our golden rule demands constant prudence.</p> <p>In the Budget I forecast this year's current surplus at 14 billion pounds. I now forecast this surplus to be 16.6 billion pounds, and in the years from 2001-2, the current surpluses are forecast to be 16, 14, 8, and 8. Figures that ensure we remain on course to balance the current Budget over the economic cycle, even on the most cautious of cases.</p> <p>Our second fiscal rule - the sustainable investment rule, a bulwark against short termism that again helps keep interest rates and mortgage rates as low as possible - is that while, over the cycle, we will borrow for investment, we do not borrow for consumption and we keep debt at a prudent and sustainable level below 40 per cent of national income.</p> <p>After a doubling of national debt in the early 1990s the ratio of debt to national income had, by 1997, risen to 44 per cent.</p> <p>Having made the necessary difficult tax and spending decisions, we have, in the three years since 1997, reduced the ratio of debt to national income from 44 per cent to 41.9 per cent to 39.6 and 36.8 per cent this April.</p> <p>I can report to this House that two decisions - first, the decision to use the proceeds from the spectrum auction to reduce our debt and second, to use this year's surplus to repay debt - now make possible a further and even more substantial reduction in debt that will keep interest payments low.</p> <p>Because we are, in total, cutting the stock of debt by as much as one third, I can report to the house that the public sector net debt as a share of GDP will now fall from 36.8 per cent last year to 32.3 per cent this year to 30.9 per cent in 2001-2 and from what was a debt to GDP ratio as high as 44 per cent in 1997, I can report that this ratio is forecast to fall to 30 per cent and remain there in future years.</p> <p>And with long term interest rates lower and debt well within the 40 per cent ceiling, we are not only well placed to deal with the ups and downs of the economic cycle but have the best platform for years for sustained long term growth</p> <p>Our budget forecast for net borrowing was a surplus of 6.5 billion pounds this year. We now forecast the surplus to be 10 billion pounds this year, and 6 billion next. In future years the deficits will be 1, 10, 12 and 13 as we borrow to invest.</p> <p>Mr Speaker, in every one of the next five years, adjusting for the cycle a fiscal stance that is the same or is tighter than at the time of the budget.</p> <p>And this year, with the spectrum proceeds, the net cash debt repayment will be 28 billion pounds.</p> <p>So our approach is to reject the old vicious circle of the eighties - rising debt, higher long term interest rates, higher debt repayment costs, lower growth, higher unemployment and enforced cuts in public spending, the old boom and bust.</p> <p>Instead, as we promised, we have by our decisions created a virtuous circle of falling debt, lower long term interest rates, lower unemployment, lower debt payments and a stronger economy releasing more resources for public spending.</p> <p>I can report to the House that because of this virtuous circle, lower unemployment has brought savings in social security which, compared with the Budget, provide an additional 1.5 billion pounds next year, and 2 and 2.5 billion pounds in future years.</p> <p>And in addition to higher government revenues this year from higher employment, higher earnings growth and steady growth, debt interest payments are now lower than we forecast at the time of the Budget - by 2.5 billion pounds next year and 2 billion pounds in the next two years.</p> <p>When we came into Government we were paying out more in debt interest payments than we were spending on our schools. Soon, as a result of cutting debt payments, we will be able to spend fifty per cent more on our schools than we do on debt interest.</p> <p>Over the last twenty years, 42 pence of every additional pound spent went to debt interest and social security. In the early nineties it was 50 per cent of every pound.</p> <p>Debt and social security will require now only 17 pence of every pound - leaving more than 80 pence in every pound of additional spending for hospitals, schools and vital services, enabling us to tackle the long term under-investment in Britain.</p> <p>It is therefore because we have cut the cost of debt and unemployment - now costing 5 billion pounds less than in 1997 - and because we have also secured sustainable growth that we are able to lock in a fiscal tightening, meet all our fiscal rules, and, within this prudent framework, we are in an even stronger position than in July to tackle under-investment and target tax cuts on our nation's priorities.</p> <p>Since July I have received representations from people in this House about public spending, including representations which propose spending growth only in line with 2 per cent GDP growth a year. I have studied this proposal in detail. It would mean by year three, cuts in spending of 16 billion pounds and after taking into account the measures I will announce on pensions today, more than 16 billion pounds.</p> <p>I have rejected these representations and because the economy both needs and can afford - and cannot afford not to -to tackle long term under investment, the Education Secretary will tomorrow, as part of allocating his annual 5 per cent real term increase in education every year, announce resources for the new learning and skills council.</p> <p>And because investment is needed in our infrastructure not just for social reasons but to build economic strength the Minister for Transport will announce how every region city and town will benefit from new investment in roads, and with new funds from the spending review allocated to each region for economic regeneration the Deputy Prime Minister will shortly publish his rural and urban white papers.</p> <p>As part of the 5.6 per cent real term's rise in NHS spending each year for the next 3 years, the Secretary of State for Health will announce for each of the next three years his allocations to health authorities up to 2004.</p> <p>And in addition to the statement on pensions from my Rt Hon Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security tomorrow, and the extra allocation we have made to improve flood defences, my Rt Hon Friend the Secretary of State for Education is announcing today additional allocations to our schools.</p> <p>The windfall tax is money raised from the utilities specifically for the purpose of extending employment opportunity through the New Deal and educational opportunity, renovating so far 17,000 schools. Such has been the success of the New Deal in getting people back to work that the windfall levy account is underspent by 200 million. So the Secretary of State for Education and Employment and I have decided that, in addition to the rise in education spending this year, lower unemployment means we can allocate new money for every school in every constituency of the country, money to be available this year for repairs and improvements, money to be paid direct to the school.</p> <p>The head teacher of every primary school will receive a cheque for between 4,000 and 7,000 pounds.</p> <p>The head teacher of each secondary school, will receive, for the smaller schools 10,000 pounds; for the larger schools 30,000 pounds: prudence once again for a purpose - enabling us to target resources to our priorities and in a sustainable way.</p> <p>And this prudence also allows us now to match public spending increases by tax cuts targeted on the country's priorities, including making reforms in the tax treatment of transport and the environment - to which I now turn.</p> <p>Between 1997 and 1999 retaining the fuel escalator introduced in 1993 helped cut borrowing by 30 billion pounds, helping deliver lower interest rates - and enabling us to begin the long overdue investment in transport, the NHS, and schools. And it will have brought about a cut in carbon dioxide pollution by an estimated one to two and a half million tonnes a year by 2010.</p> <p>But today, like all countries, we are having to deal with the rise in world oil prices from 11 to 31 dollars. Because OPEC itself accepts that the world price is unacceptably high, our international efforts are geared to ensuring that production is raised and prices fall.</p> <p>So I recognise and understand the very genuine concerns that motorists and hauliers have - and it is because here in Britain we have already cut the deficit, already set aside 180 billions for the 10 year transport plan and already shown how we are meeting the Kyoto targets that in the last Budget I removed the fuel escalator, and made environmentally based cuts in car and lorry licences and gave new incentives for environmentally efficient fuels.</p> <p>And in line with the principles we have set down I am now able today to show how we can complete these reforms and do more to meet people's concerns - without putting at risk either our economic stability, necessary investment in public services, or our environmental gains. Indeed, the reforms I now propose are tailor-made to meet our environmental obligations.</p> <p>The annual rise in the price of fuel that would automatically be introduced on budget day would raise 560 million pounds putting petrol and diesel up by around one and a half pence a litre. I propose at a cost of 560 million pounds, a freeze in excise duties - an across-the-board duty freeze on all fuels that would initially last until April 2002-- and, if the oil price remains at a high price between now and then, I can tell the house that there would be a duty freeze for a further year.</p> <p>I intend to go further in three vital respects.</p> <p>On top of the duty freeze - budgeted for in our fiscal arithmetic - the first of the proposals I will consult upon would itself involve additional expenditure of as much as an extra 1,000 million pounds and help promote substantial benefit to the environment .</p> <p>Yesterday we published a report showing the environmental benefits from the introduction of ultra low sulphur diesel in reducing local air pollution.</p> <p>As a result of cuts we made in excise duty on ultra low sulphur diesel, usage in Britain has risen from 20 per cent in 1997 to 40 per cent in 1998 to 100 per cent in 2000. It requires no change to be made in lorry and van engines and it now accounts for virtually 100 per cent of the market for diesel in Britain today. Britain is now leading in this cleaner diesel.</p> <p>We now need to build on that environmental achievement. The widespread use of ultra low sulphur petrol would further and significantly improve local air quality. Crucially, it would require no change to existing car engines.</p> <p>And it is now time to make this cleaner fuel available in every petrol station of the United Kingdom, and to make the use of this fuel which requires no change in any car cheaper for everyone.</p> <p>To do so I propose to cut the excise duty for ultra low sulphur petrol so that it replaces unleaded petrol in every petrol station in Britain and at a lower excise duty.</p> <p>On 1 October we reduced the duty on ultra low sulphur petrol by 1p a litre.</p> <p>I propose from Budget 2001 a further reduction of 2p a litre - making a cut of 3p in total on all ultra low sulphur petrol.</p> <p>And because it is right to maintain the proper balance between petrol and diesel, I propose also from Budget day to match the cut in low sulphur petrol with a 3p cut in excise duties in ultra low sulphur diesel which will go to all diesel users.</p> <p>I expect ultra low sulphur diesel and petrol to account for 100 per cent of the market next year and when the excise duty cut is introduced at Budget time motorists using any petrol station in Britain to be able to benefit from this duty cut.</p> <p>It is by giving this incentive for cleaner fuels that we can both advance our environmental principles and ensure - with a 3p cut per litre in all ultra low sulphur duty a cheaper cleaner fuel available in every garage, a better deal for drivers and cleaner air across Britain.</p> <p>I can also announce that for all the cars which still use lead replacement petrol - where there is no longer an environmental case for a higher duty rate - I propose from Budget day to end the differential and cut the excise duty by 2p per litre.</p> <p>I now intend to go further to help the haulage industry that is undergoing restructuring.</p> <p>I propose support for scrapping or converting older lorries with a 100 million investment fund, including help for buying the new lorries that meet the highest technological and environment standards and support for the introduction of logistics and computerisation.</p> <p>The Deputy Prime Minister will also announce help for an industry-wide training and retraining scheme.</p> <p>But we can do more.</p> <p>So that foreign lorries pay their share of the costs of using our roads, we intend to introduce in Britain a vignette system, a British disc under which non-British companies and lorries pay their share to Britain for using British roads.</p> <p>The Government has considered an essential user rebate or blue diesel scheme for lorry diesel.</p> <p>Such a scheme would be administratively cumbersome, could be levied only on future purchases of diesel, and would have to be opened to foreign lorries using British roads. It would not help hauliers where their fuel prices are directly passed on to customers. It would have no environmental benefits</p> <p>The scheme I am proposing is far better. Subject to consultation and legal clearance I now propose to bring forward a much needed reform begun last year in vehicle excise duty for lorries that will radically cut rates for larger lorries with traditionally high license fees,. The scheme will be implemented in Budget 2001 - to sweep aside the 100 separate rates, consolidate them into only seven rate bands , linked to environmental standards, and cutting the rates to match the lowest in Europe.</p> <p>Lorries in the most competitive sector will save over 2000 pounds. Over 250,000 lorries will each pay lower licence fees as a result of a 300 million pound annual cut in licence fees. 100,000 lorries will save over 1,000. The average saving per lorry will be 715 a year and the cuts are the equivalent in value to a cut of 3 pence in the price of diesel for the haulage industry, and again with environmental incentives built in.</p> <p>Our proposals for the detailed new scheme - and license rates-- are published today and the Government is able to start the transitional arrangements to this new licence system immediately.</p> <p>I have allocated 265 million pounds for this financial year - half of the annual revenue raised from lorry VED - to be spend before March for a refund scheme that can repay lorry owners up to half of this year's licence fee. 250,000 lorries, and all large lorries, will benefit from the refunds. They will be worth for some of the largest lorries paying the highest fees 1,000 and up to 4,000 pounds this year . Refunds will be paid from next month, payments to be completed by the end of January - the detailed arrangements to be announced by the Minister for Transport.</p> <p>To help restructuring and investment in farming, the Minister for Agriculture announced last week an addition to this year's 220 million pound package of measures - agri money compensation for arable producers. In addition to freezing duty on red diesel at its current rate of 3p a litre, I also intend in Budget 2001 to abolish VED on tractors and agricultural vehicles completely.</p> <p>I now have a similar proposal for car license fees. Consistent with our environmental principle that we tax vehicle ownership less, I want now to complete our environmentally based reform of vehicle excise duty for cars .</p> <p>The new licence fee we are introducing for new cars registered from March 2001 is linked to environmental efficiency.</p> <p>For all cars under 1200 cc there is also now a lower rate licence fee with a 55 pound deduction on the standard licence.</p> <p>While this change has been welcomed, many, especially those in rural areas, have put it to me that greater choice would be available to rural motorists and motorists generally if the 55 pound deduction could be accessible for, not just cars under 1200 cc, but for cars up to 1500 ccs, including, for example, the Focus, Golf, Astra, Escort and the Rover 214.</p> <p>So I propose to extend the lower rate licence fee, the 55 pound discount, to cars up to 1500 cc, to be paid out from July but to be backdated from today. So all those who have a car from 1200 to 1500 cc -an extra 5.4 million cars-will be entitled to 55 pound off their annual licence fee from today.</p> <p>So in total, over 8.5 million existing cars, one in every three, will now pay 55 pounds below the standard fee.</p> <p>So, for motorists as a whole, with the duty freeze, the new reduced licence fee and the cut for ultra low sulphur petrol, the proposed Budget package makes changes worth the equivalent of a 4p a litre cut while meeting our environmental objectives.</p> <p>And by next year for the haulage industry changes that are worth the equivalent of a cut of 8 pence on a litre: in each case meeting our environmental obligations, not putting at risk public investment in vital services, nor the stability of the economy. Measures upon which Ministers are now inviting discussion in the Pre-Budget consultation which will take place as Ministers visit every region of the country.</p> <p><b>The rest of the speech</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/budget2000/article/0,2763,394543,00.html\">Part 1: the economy</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/budget2000/article/0,2763,394552,00.html\">Part 3: families and pensioners</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Mr Speaker, high productivity and rising employment depend not just on ending decades of under-investment and targeting tax incentives on our priorities, but on entrenching a low inflation culture that prudently keeps interest rates and mortgage rates as low as possible. It is because we have learned from the mistakes of the eighties and before that I can tell the House that - in spite of demands made to me - I have decided - in the interests of keeping interest rates and mortgage rates as low as possible - to lock in, over the coming years, a fiscal stance that is the same or is tighter than we said at the time of the Budget. Let me give the House the background and the full financial figures. Our first fiscal rule - the golden rule, the first rule necessary to keep interest rates and mortgage rates as low as possible - is that over the cycle there must be a current surplus. So however tempting it may be for some to identify large temporary surpluses as an excuse for permanent injections of resources into the economy, our golden rule demands constant prudence. In the Budget I forecast this year's current surplus at 14 billion pounds. I now forecast this surplus to be 16.6 billion pounds, and in the years from 2001-2, the current surpluses are forecast to be 16, 14, 8, and 8. Figures that ensure we remain on course to balance the current Budget over the economic cycle, even on the most cautious of cases. Our second fiscal rule - the sustainable investment rule, a bulwark against short termism that again helps keep interest rates and mortgage rates as low as possible - is that while, over the cycle, we will borrow for investment, we do not borrow for consumption and we keep debt at a prudent and sustainable level below 40 per cent of national income. After a doubling of national debt in the early 1990s the ratio of debt to national income had, by 1997, risen to 44 per cent. Having made the necessary difficult tax and spending decisions, we have, in the three years since 1997, reduced the ratio of debt to national income from 44 per cent to 41.9 per cent to 39.6 and 36.8 per cent this April. I can report to this House that two decisions - first, the decision to use the proceeds from the spectrum auction to reduce our debt and second, to use this year's surplus to repay debt - now make possible a further and even more substantial reduction in debt that will keep interest payments low. Because we are, in total, cutting the stock of debt by as much as one third, I can report to the house that the public sector net debt as a share of GDP will now fall from 36.8 per cent last year to 32.3 per cent this year to 30.9 per cent in 2001-2 and from what was a debt to GDP ratio as high as 44 per cent in 1997, I can report that this ratio is forecast to fall to 30 per cent and remain there in future years. And with long term interest rates lower and debt well within the 40 per cent ceiling, we are not only well placed to deal with the ups and downs of the economic cycle but have the best platform for years for sustained long term growth Our budget forecast for net borrowing was a surplus of 6.5 billion pounds this year. We now forecast the surplus to be 10 billion pounds this year, and 6 billion next. In future years the deficits will be 1, 10, 12 and 13 as we borrow to invest. Mr Speaker, in every one of the next five years, adjusting for the cycle a fiscal stance that is the same or is tighter than at the time of the budget. And this year, with the spectrum proceeds, the net cash debt repayment will be 28 billion pounds. So our approach is to reject the old vicious circle of the eighties - rising debt, higher long term interest rates, higher debt repayment costs, lower growth, higher unemployment and enforced cuts in public spending, the old boom and bust. Instead, as we promised, we have by our decisions created a virtuous circle of falling debt, lower long term interest rates, lower unemployment, lower debt payments and a stronger economy releasing more resources for public spending. I can report to the House that because of this virtuous circle, lower unemployment has brought savings in social security which, compared with the Budget, provide an additional 1.5 billion pounds next year, and 2 and 2.5 billion pounds in future years. And in addition to higher government revenues this year from higher employment, higher earnings growth and steady growth, debt interest payments are now lower than we forecast at the time of the Budget - by 2.5 billion pounds next year and 2 billion pounds in the next two years. When we came into Government we were paying out more in debt interest payments than we were spending on our schools. Soon, as a result of cutting debt payments, we will be able to spend fifty per cent more on our schools than we do on debt interest. Over the last twenty years, 42 pence of every additional pound spent went to debt interest and social security. In the early nineties it was 50 per cent of every pound. Debt and social security will require now only 17 pence of every pound - leaving more than 80 pence in every pound of additional spending for hospitals, schools and vital services, enabling us to tackle the long term under-investment in Britain. It is therefore because we have cut the cost of debt and unemployment - now costing 5 billion pounds less than in 1997 - and because we have also secured sustainable growth that we are able to lock in a fiscal tightening, meet all our fiscal rules, and, within this prudent framework, we are in an even stronger position than in July to tackle under-investment and target tax cuts on our nation's priorities. Since July I have received representations from people in this House about public spending, including representations which propose spending growth only in line with 2 per cent GDP growth a year. I have studied this proposal in detail. It would mean by year three, cuts in spending of 16 billion pounds and after taking into account the measures I will announce on pensions today, more than 16 billion pounds. I have rejected these representations and because the economy both needs and can afford - and cannot afford not to -to tackle long term under investment, the Education Secretary will tomorrow, as part of allocating his annual 5 per cent real term increase in education every year, announce resources for the new learning and skills council. And because investment is needed in our infrastructure not just for social reasons but to build economic strength the Minister for Transport will announce how every region city and town will benefit from new investment in roads, and with new funds from the spending review allocated to each region for economic regeneration the Deputy Prime Minister will shortly publish his rural and urban white papers. As part of the 5.6 per cent real term's rise in NHS spending each year for the next 3 years, the Secretary of State for Health will announce for each of the next three years his allocations to health authorities up to 2004. And in addition to the statement on pensions from my Rt Hon Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security tomorrow, and the extra allocation we have made to improve flood defences, my Rt Hon Friend the Secretary of State for Education is announcing today additional allocations to our schools. The windfall tax is money raised from the utilities specifically for the purpose of extending employment opportunity through the New Deal and educational opportunity, renovating so far 17,000 schools. Such has been the success of the New Deal in getting people back to work that the windfall levy account is underspent by 200 million. So the Secretary of State for Education and Employment and I have decided that, in addition to the rise in education spending this year, lower unemployment means we can allocate new money for every school in every constituency of the country, money to be available this year for repairs and improvements, money to be paid direct to the school. The head teacher of every primary school will receive a cheque for between 4,000 and 7,000 pounds. The head teacher of each secondary school, will receive, for the smaller schools 10,000 pounds; for the larger schools 30,000 pounds: prudence once again for a purpose - enabling us to target resources to our priorities and in a sustainable way. And this prudence also allows us now to match public spending increases by tax cuts targeted on the country's priorities, including making reforms in the tax treatment of transport and the environment - to which I now turn. Between 1997 and 1999 retaining the fuel escalator introduced in 1993 helped cut borrowing by 30 billion pounds, helping deliver lower interest rates - and enabling us to begin the long overdue investment in transport, the NHS, and schools. And it will have brought about a cut in carbon dioxide pollution by an estimated one to two and a half million tonnes a year by 2010. But today, like all countries, we are having to deal with the rise in world oil prices from 11 to 31 dollars. Because OPEC itself accepts that the world price is unacceptably high, our international efforts are geared to ensuring that production is raised and prices fall. So I recognise and understand the very genuine concerns that motorists and hauliers have - and it is because here in Britain we have already cut the deficit, already set aside 180 billions for the 10 year transport plan and already shown how we are meeting the Kyoto targets that in the last Budget I removed the fuel escalator, and made environmentally based cuts in car and lorry licences and gave new incentives for environmentally efficient fuels. And in line with the principles we have set down I am now able today to show how we can complete these reforms and do more to meet people's concerns - without putting at risk either our economic stability, necessary investment in public services, or our environmental gains. Indeed, the reforms I now propose are tailor-made to meet our environmental obligations. The annual rise in the price of fuel that would automatically be introduced on budget day would raise 560 million pounds putting petrol and diesel up by around one and a half pence a litre. I propose at a cost of 560 million pounds, a freeze in excise duties - an across-the-board duty freeze on all fuels that would initially last until April 2002-- and, if the oil price remains at a high price between now and then, I can tell the house that there would be a duty freeze for a further year. I intend to go further in three vital respects. On top of the duty freeze - budgeted for in our fiscal arithmetic - the first of the proposals I will consult upon would itself involve additional expenditure of as much as an extra 1,000 million pounds and help promote substantial benefit to the environment . Yesterday we published a report showing the environmental benefits from the introduction of ultra low sulphur diesel in reducing local air pollution. As a result of cuts we made in excise duty on ultra low sulphur diesel, usage in Britain has risen from 20 per cent in 1997 to 40 per cent in 1998 to 100 per cent in 2000. It requires no change to be made in lorry and van engines and it now accounts for virtually 100 per cent of the market for diesel in Britain today. Britain is now leading in this cleaner diesel. We now need to build on that environmental achievement. The widespread use of ultra low sulphur petrol would further and significantly improve local air quality. Crucially, it would require no change to existing car engines. And it is now time to make this cleaner fuel available in every petrol station of the United Kingdom, and to make the use of this fuel which requires no change in any car cheaper for everyone. To do so I propose to cut the excise duty for ultra low sulphur petrol so that it replaces unleaded petrol in every petrol station in Britain and at a lower excise duty. On 1 October we reduced the duty on ultra low sulphur petrol by 1p a litre. I propose from Budget 2001 a further reduction of 2p a litre - making a cut of 3p in total on all ultra low sulphur petrol. And because it is right to maintain the proper balance between petrol and diesel, I propose also from Budget day to match the cut in low sulphur petrol with a 3p cut in excise duties in ultra low sulphur diesel which will go to all diesel users. I expect ultra low sulphur diesel and petrol to account for 100 per cent of the market next year and when the excise duty cut is introduced at Budget time motorists using any petrol station in Britain to be able to benefit from this duty cut. It is by giving this incentive for cleaner fuels that we can both advance our environmental principles and ensure - with a 3p cut per litre in all ultra low sulphur duty a cheaper cleaner fuel available in every garage, a better deal for drivers and cleaner air across Britain. I can also announce that for all the cars which still use lead replacement petrol - where there is no longer an environmental case for a higher duty rate - I propose from Budget day to end the differential and cut the excise duty by 2p per litre. I now intend to go further to help the haulage industry that is undergoing restructuring. I propose support for scrapping or converting older lorries with a 100 million investment fund, including help for buying the new lorries that meet the highest technological and environment standards and support for the introduction of logistics and computerisation. The Deputy Prime Minister will also announce help for an industry-wide training and retraining scheme. But we can do more. So that foreign lorries pay their share of the costs of using our roads, we intend to introduce in Britain a vignette system, a British disc under which non-British companies and lorries pay their share to Britain for using British roads. The Government has considered an essential user rebate or blue diesel scheme for lorry diesel. Such a scheme would be administratively cumbersome, could be levied only on future purchases of diesel, and would have to be opened to foreign lorries using British roads. It would not help hauliers where their fuel prices are directly passed on to customers. It would have no environmental benefits The scheme I am proposing is far better. Subject to consultation and legal clearance I now propose to bring forward a much needed reform begun last year in vehicle excise duty for lorries that will radically cut rates for larger lorries with traditionally high license fees,. The scheme will be implemented in Budget 2001 - to sweep aside the 100 separate rates, consolidate them into only seven rate bands , linked to environmental standards, and cutting the rates to match the lowest in Europe. Lorries in the most competitive sector will save over 2000 pounds. Over 250,000 lorries will each pay lower licence fees as a result of a 300 million pound annual cut in licence fees. 100,000 lorries will save over 1,000. The average saving per lorry will be 715 a year and the cuts are the equivalent in value to a cut of 3 pence in the price of diesel for the haulage industry, and again with environmental incentives built in. Our proposals for the detailed new scheme - and license rates-- are published today and the Government is able to start the transitional arrangements to this new licence system immediately. I have allocated 265 million pounds for this financial year - half of the annual revenue raised from lorry VED - to be spend before March for a refund scheme that can repay lorry owners up to half of this year's licence fee. 250,000 lorries, and all large lorries, will benefit from the refunds. They will be worth for some of the largest lorries paying the highest fees 1,000 and up to 4,000 pounds this year . Refunds will be paid from next month, payments to be completed by the end of January - the detailed arrangements to be announced by the Minister for Transport. To help restructuring and investment in farming, the Minister for Agriculture announced last week an addition to this year's 220 million pound package of measures - agri money compensation for arable producers. In addition to freezing duty on red diesel at its current rate of 3p a litre, I also intend in Budget 2001 to abolish VED on tractors and agricultural vehicles completely. I now have a similar proposal for car license fees. Consistent with our environmental principle that we tax vehicle ownership less, I want now to complete our environmentally based reform of vehicle excise duty for cars . The new licence fee we are introducing for new cars registered from March 2001 is linked to environmental efficiency. For all cars under 1200 cc there is also now a lower rate licence fee with a 55 pound deduction on the standard licence. While this change has been welcomed, many, especially those in rural areas, have put it to me that greater choice would be available to rural motorists and motorists generally if the 55 pound deduction could be accessible for, not just cars under 1200 cc, but for cars up to 1500 ccs, including, for example, the Focus, Golf, Astra, Escort and the Rover 214. So I propose to extend the lower rate licence fee, the 55 pound discount, to cars up to 1500 cc, to be paid out from July but to be backdated from today. So all those who have a car from 1200 to 1500 cc -an extra 5.4 million cars-will be entitled to 55 pound off their annual licence fee from today. So in total, over 8.5 million existing cars, one in every three, will now pay 55 pounds below the standard fee. So, for motorists as a whole, with the duty freeze, the new reduced licence fee and the cut for ultra low sulphur petrol, the proposed Budget package makes changes worth the equivalent of a 4p a litre cut while meeting our environmental objectives. And by next year for the haulage industry changes that are worth the equivalent of a cut of 8 pence on a litre: in each case meeting our environmental obligations, not putting at risk public investment in vital services, nor the stability of the economy.

      "body": "<p>The Democratic candidate, Al Gore, refused to concede defeat to his Republican rival, George W Bush, today as the closeness of the crucial vote in Florida triggered an automatic recount in the state.</p> <p>Election officials in Florida were ordered to begin a recount of nearly 6m votes in the stunningly close election for US president after the margin between George W Bush and Al Gore shrank through the night.</p> <p>The final result is not expected until tomorrow at the earliest - although it may possibly be delayed by legal challenges.</p> <p>Florida's secretary of state said the recount should be finished by the end of the day tomorrow (Florida is five hours behind Britain). Both national parties were sending teams of lawyers to monitor the recount. At last count, Mr Bush led Mr Gore by 1,655 votes in an unofficial Associated Press count with an unknown number of absentee ballots yet to be counted.</p> <p>Mr Gore and Mr Bush were tied at 48% apiece in the national vote today. The pressure on the recount is intense because Florida, with its 25 electoral votes, is the state that will decide who becomes 43rd president of the United States.</p> <p>With the vote difference less than 0.5% an automatic recount was triggered under state law.</p> <p>The law allows 10 days to count outstanding overseas ballots as long as they are postmarked no later than election day.</p> <p>In the 538-seat national electoral college - which decides the election - Mr Gore had 260 votes and Mr Bush 246 of the 270 needed to win. Florida has 25 electoral votes, so the winner of that state will capture the presidency. The remaining seven votes come from Oregon.</p> <p>In the United States as a whole, the popular vote count was seesawing. The overall vote at 2.45pm GMT was:<br><b>Al Gore:</b> Total 48,508,173 (48%)<br><b>George W Bush:</b> Total 48,314,142 (48%)<br><b>Ralph Nader (Green):</b> 2,639,700 (3%)<br><b>Pat Buchanan (Reform):</b> 443,567 (0%)</p> <p>In Austin, Texas, Mr Bush's spokesman, Don Evans, was downbeat as he addressed a crowd waiting for a victory speech. \"They're still counting, and I'm confident when it's all said and done, we will prevail,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Unbelievable,\" sighed Mr Bush's adviser, Karen Hughes, after fielding a second call from Mr Gore in which he retracted his concession.</p> <p>Earlier Mr Gore had called Mr Bush to congratulate him and then gone to the war memorial in Nashville, Tennessee, to make a concession speech.

      "bodyText": "The Democratic candidate, Al Gore, refused to concede defeat to his Republican rival, George W Bush, today as the closeness of the crucial vote in Florida triggered an automatic recount in the state. Election officials in Florida were ordered to begin a recount of nearly 6m votes in the stunningly close election for US president after the margin between George W Bush and Al Gore shrank through the night. The final result is not expected until tomorrow at the earliest - although it may possibly be delayed by legal challenges. Florida's secretary of state said the recount should be finished by the end of the day tomorrow (Florida is five hours behind Britain). Both national parties were sending teams of lawyers to monitor the recount. At last count, Mr Bush led Mr Gore by 1,655 votes in an unofficial Associated Press count with an unknown number of absentee ballots yet to be counted. Mr Gore and Mr Bush were tied at 48% apiece in the national vote today. The pressure on the recount is intense because Florida, with its 25 electoral votes, is the state that will decide who becomes 43rd president of the United States. With the vote difference less than 0.5% an automatic recount was triggered under state law. The law allows 10 days to count outstanding overseas ballots as long as they are postmarked no later than election day. In the 538-seat national electoral college - which decides the election - Mr Gore had 260 votes and Mr Bush 246 of the 270 needed to win. Florida has 25 electoral votes, so the winner of that state will capture the presidency. The remaining seven votes come from Oregon. In the United States as a whole, the popular vote count was seesawing. The overall vote at 2.45pm GMT was: Al Gore: Total 48,508,173 (48%) George W Bush: Total 48,314,142 (48%) Ralph Nader (Green): 2,639,700 (3%) Pat Buchanan (Reform): 443,567 (0%) In Austin, Texas, Mr Bush's spokesman, Don Evans, was downbeat as he addressed a crowd waiting for a victory speech. \"They're still counting, and I'm confident when it's all said and done, we will prevail,\" he said. \"Unbelievable,\" sighed Mr Bush's adviser, Karen Hughes, after fielding a second call from Mr Gore in which he retracted his concession. Earlier Mr Gore had called Mr Bush to congratulate him and then gone to the war memorial in Nashville, Tennessee, to make a concession speech. But instead, his campaign manager, William Daley, appeared before the crowd and said the race was not over. \"Until the results in Florida become official, our campaign continues,\" Mr Daley said to cheering supporters. Turnout was surprisingly brisk, with many encouraged to vote by the tight race. The Committee for the Study of the American Electorate estimated that up to 53% of Americans cast ballots - more than voted in 1996, but fewer than in 1992. If Mr Bush wins, the Republicans would control both Congress and the presidency for the first time in 46 years after retaining their grip on the two houses in yesterday's election. Hillary Rodham Clinton, the first wife of a president to run for political office, won the New York Senate seat. Mr Bush and his running mate, Dick Cheney, won in Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, North and South Dakota, North and South Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming. Mr Gore and his vice-presidential partner, Joe Lieberman, won California, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin. In the battle for control of Congress, Republicans extended their six-year reign in the Senate and the House of Representatives. In the House races, Republicans gained seats in Virginia, Pennsylvania and New York, but surrendered one in Oklahoma. Democrats needed eight new seats to win control.

Subscriptions account for some 85% of Udate's revenues. </p> <p>According to Udate president and ceo Mel Morris, Udate will reach profitability in the first quarter of next year. </p> <p>He said Udate's figures showed it was one of the stickiest websites on the internet, with users spending an average of between 1-4 hours a day on the site. </p> <p>Udate is aimed primarily at an audience of over-25s and enjoys a position at the top end of the US dating industry. Competitors include Matchmaker and Match.com. </p> <p>\"We offer a very different type of service. Members keep coming back to Udate because there is a strong feel-good factor on the site - we're about quality not quantity,\" said Mr Morris. </p> <p>In the UK, Udate hopes to pull in up to 1,000 new members a day on the back of word of mouth and 'real world' events such as social evenings, vacations and various gatherings. </p> <p>Mr Morris said that while the company's head office is in Derby, it saved almost \u00a33m over 18 months by locating its ISP and server in the US.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A UK online dating agency that chose to locate its business in the US to evade crippling start-up costs, now plans a \u00a32m assault on the UK market. Udate.co.uk had its official UK launch last night although the founders already claim to have more than 100,000 members in the UK. The company, which is listed on Nasdaq, has been operating for around 18 months in the US and is about to pass its 1 millionth member. Membership in the UK costs from \u00a35.95 for a ten-day membership to \u00a322.95 for a two-month Gold membership. Subscriptions account for some 85% of Udate's revenues. According to Udate president and ceo Mel Morris, Udate will reach profitability in the first quarter of next year. He said Udate's figures showed it was one of the stickiest websites on the internet, with users spending an average of between 1-4 hours a day on the site. Udate is aimed primarily at an audience of over-25s and enjoys a position at the top end of the US dating industry. Competitors include Matchmaker and Match.com. \"We offer a very different type of service. Members keep coming back to Udate because there is a strong feel-good factor on the site - we're about quality not quantity,\" said Mr Morris. In the UK, Udate hopes to pull in up to 1,000 new members a day on the back of word of mouth and 'real world' events such as social evenings, vacations and various gatherings. Mr Morris said that while the company's head office is in Derby, it saved almost \u00a33m over 18 months by locating its ISP and server in the US.",

      "body": "<p>'A good thing happened at school today,\" announced my four year old, proudly. \"Justin hit me.\" I wondered how this could possibly be good. </p> <p>\"Well, I told the teacher and she made Justin stand in the corner,\" replied Charlie, eyes shining. </p> <p>It was hard to greet this exchange with anything but a shudder. How was it that I had produced a tiny tell-tale, whose readiness so young to inform on his peers would no doubt lead to a bruising time throughout his school years? But my horror was swiftly followed by the realisation that Charlie was only obeying orders - the orders I have handed out from birth onwards about not hitting back, deflecting aggression in any confrontation and consulting an adult at every turn. Mediation through a higher authority would produce results, I told the children. And in Charlie's case, it had. </p> <p>If only it were that simple. But what makes it tougher for my boys, as far as parental guidance is concerned, is that they are caught in the crossfire of radically conflicting advice. While I preach a United Nations style of conflict resolution, my husband, who points out that he has the advantage of having actually been a boy in a playground, prefers to repeat his favourite anecdote about downing a larger pupil with a single blow when he was six. As far as the guidance goes, it is Old Testament versus New Testament. An eye for an eye or turn the other cheek. Churchill or Chamberlain. To say the least, it is a mixed message. </p> <p>But if we have been guilty of confusing our children, then I'm sure we're not alone. The question of answering violence with violence appears to be so taboo that many parents cannot be relied upon to answer truthfully. It seems they would rather turn a blind eye to the Lord of the Flies world of the playground and leave the children to sort out their own battles. No one wants an aggressive child, but neither does anyone want one who can't fend for itself. Few people will admit to advising their child to hit back, but everyone tells children to \"stand up to bullies\". The question they don't answer is exactly how you go about standing up to a bully.

In a playground full of children who have received significant physical punishment, in a school where the ratio of kids to teachers is not brilliant, it is useful to learn the skills to protect yourself.

      "bodyText": "'A good thing happened at school today,\" announced my four year old, proudly. \"Justin hit me.\" I wondered how this could possibly be good. \"Well, I told the teacher and she made Justin stand in the corner,\" replied Charlie, eyes shining. It was hard to greet this exchange with anything but a shudder. How was it that I had produced a tiny tell-tale, whose readiness so young to inform on his peers would no doubt lead to a bruising time throughout his school years? But my horror was swiftly followed by the realisation that Charlie was only obeying orders - the orders I have handed out from birth onwards about not hitting back, deflecting aggression in any confrontation and consulting an adult at every turn. Mediation through a higher authority would produce results, I told the children. And in Charlie's case, it had. If only it were that simple. But what makes it tougher for my boys, as far as parental guidance is concerned, is that they are caught in the crossfire of radically conflicting advice. While I preach a United Nations style of conflict resolution, my husband, who points out that he has the advantage of having actually been a boy in a playground, prefers to repeat his favourite anecdote about downing a larger pupil with a single blow when he was six. As far as the guidance goes, it is Old Testament versus New Testament. An eye for an eye or turn the other cheek. Churchill or Chamberlain. To say the least, it is a mixed message. But if we have been guilty of confusing our children, then I'm sure we're not alone. The question of answering violence with violence appears to be so taboo that many parents cannot be relied upon to answer truthfully. It seems they would rather turn a blind eye to the Lord of the Flies world of the playground and leave the children to sort out their own battles. No one wants an aggressive child, but neither does anyone want one who can't fend for itself. Few people will admit to advising their child to hit back, but everyone tells children to \"stand up to bullies\". The question they don't answer is exactly how you go about standing up to a bully. The old line that \"all bullies are cowards\" must look even less convincing when somebody bigger and tougher is standing four inches away, taking your favourite conker out of your blazer pocket.

      "body": "<p>A bagel shop in Brick Lane, east London was where I introduced my new girlfriend to my Jewish culture. I couldn't wait for Paula, with a Protestant mother and Catholic father, to try one of these hard bread rolls stuffed with salmon, the cream cheese oozing through the hole in its centre. OK, she may afterwards have developed food poisoning and a two-year allergy to smoked fish, but no one said that getting to know another culture would be easy. </p> <p>Bagels are one of the few everyday reminders of the Jewish presence in this country. There are also many well-known Jewish personalities - the ubiquitous Robert Winston, for example. And there is a long list of Yiddish and Hebrew words that have added colour to the English language - nosh, shlep, chutzpah, kosher, shtoom. But Jewish culture does not have the omnipresent icons and symbols to match the awe-inspiring cathedrals, numerous churches, classical music's constant references to Christianity and all-embracing festivals such as Easter and Christmas - things which fire the imagination of a child. </p> <p>I don't have a problem with this. I even sang in the choir on Songs of Praise once: I was drafted in because I attended a local music school, but I mimed the words. Some of my best friends are from Christian backgrounds, not least Paula. </p> <p>Just as Paula and I - both atheists with non-religious parents - to some extent had a Christian upbringing by default, so will our children. I had no religious education and the festivals were never central in my parents' home. But they did have me circumcised and when I was 13, they asked me if I wanted a Bar Mitzva. I refused, thus passing up the lifetime supply of fountain pens I would have received as gifts. Our son Ben, five, is attending a Church of England school, and Becky, three, is likely to follow suit, so it is up to us to add Jewish culture to the mix of memories and rituals that make up their lives. </p> <p>We have parties at Easter and Christmas, but also for the chief Jewish festivals, such as Passover with its use of salt water in the Seder meal to remember the tears of the Jews and joy at a new life liberated from slavery. How many ceremonies can be so moving and educational? The culture of diaspora also brings with it a distinctive cuisine and the Yiddish language. When my 92-year-old grandmother Beatrice calls me \"bubbeleh\" (a term of affection that means honey - literally \"little grandmother\"), the expression illuminates a path back through hundreds of years of tradition. There is that caustic sense of humour, a tradition of music both haunting and sad and a cherishing of life that is at the heart of Jewish culture: when a baby is born or a marriage confirmed, the toast is \"l'chaim\" (to life). Apart from anything else, this seems a good philosophy to pass on to a child. </p> <p>For Ben and Becky to know Jewish culture is to have an essential link with their past. It will add richness to their lives. But fathoming the definition of a non-believing Jew, such as myself, in order to decide what to pass on to them is trickier. A belief in God is, thankfully, only necessary if you want to embrace Judaism as well as Jewish culture - something I have no wish to do. There have been many articles, pamphlets and books with titles such as The Jewish Question and What Is A Jew? But there is no clear answer: because of the diaspora, different people have adopted different lifestyles depending on country and region. Jews in Britain occupy a very different place to Jews in Israel or the US. </p> <p>My ancestors arrived around the turn of the 20th century, many from Vitebsk in Belarus. Some were filled with revolutionary zeal, partly because they were driven to it by pogroms and partly because they were inspired by the dream of building a more just society. Some remained in the UK for only a few years before returning to the old country to help their comrades. </p> <p>My grandfather, Phil Piratin, turned his back on orthodox Judaism. After studying at Yeshivoth (a religious school), he joined instead - and much to his father's disgust - the Communist party. He was elected as a councillor in Stepney in the late 30s, after the Battle of Cable Street when local activists fought police to stop Oswald Moseley's Blackshirts from marching through the Jewish east end. In 1945, he became the constituency's Communist MP. Our children's family history is thus social history, too; but what will it mean to them? </p> <p>To know your background is to understand your fundamental loyalties. When, for instance, Paula and I came to discuss whether or not to have Benjamin circumcised, I was shocked by my strength of feeling. I had no reason to want to subject him to this operation, yet emotionally I did because of its powerful symbolism in marking a tribal affiliation. I couldn't help feeling that not to do so was like turning my back on a long line of suffering and achievement. In the end, we decided not to circumcise him but that decision means that Ben is different from me. </p> <p>I feel Jewish: I am a Jew even though I am an atheist and have chosen not to embrace many of the rituals. When Norman Tebbit devised his repugnant cricket test - if West Indians don't support England then they are not truly English - he was making it clear that he saw them as temporary tenants, not freeholders, in his land. I have on occasion received similar reminders of my tenure. When I criticised the British involvement in Kosovo at a dinner party recently, one guest inquired politely: \"But what about you and Israel?\" The implication was clear: my loyalty and true home lay elsewhere, even though I have never lived in the Middle East and the last relative of mine who was an immigrant arrived here a century ago. </p> <p>How will Ben and Becky feel if (or, perhaps, when) in the playground they are subjected to anti-semitic jibes without even knowing why? They will be completely unprepared. Far better for us to explain why such an event, horrible as it is, may be an opportunity to challenge prejudice. Imagine, worse still, that, ignorant of their own history, they were to begin Jew-baiting themselves. What damage would it do to them if they were to discover the truth so late? </p> <p>I, and perhaps many like me, am irrationally afraid that by looking back to old traditions, we are taking a step on the path back towards the ghetto. But the opposite is the case: by picking the best from our past we create something new and better for the future. Soon, we will be lighting the Menorah candles for Chanukah, decorating the Christmas tree and eating bagels with bacon for breakfast.</p>",

Fight Club, the bruising debut that made his reputation, concerns guys beating seven shades out of each other in the name of personal growth. Survivor, his second book, centres on the only member of a death cult left alive following a mass suicide. His latest, Invisible Monsters, enters the psyches of men, women and others balanced somewhere in between, who run amok in the cultural china shop where catwalk fashion, sexual transgression and the grim realities of \"gender reassignment\" meet. </p> <p>In these latest thrumming pages we make the acquaintance of citizens with half their faces blown off or leafing eagerly through catalogues of surgically pre-fabricated vaginas. In all his books the prose of Palahniuk - pronounced \"paula-nick\" - is hard and glittering, his sentences dark diamonds of bleak insight and unforgiving parody. But hark: he knows of harmony, of tenderness, of love. \"All of the books,\" he explains, \"are just a very, very cynical way of getting to a sentimental place.\" </p> <p>As ever with creativity that amplifies awfulness in order to uncover something finer and braver, Palahniuk's stories have suffered from dimwitted misinterpretations. For example, David Fincher's funny and powerful film version of Fight Club was denounced in some quarters as an advertisement for fascism when, if anything, it might be read as a warning about how a certain form of idealised masculinity can manifest itself in slavish, martial forms. </p> <p>Palahniuk's characters are always on the run from all that is bland and predictable, soporific and safe: Ikea furnishings, career conformity, obedient consumerism, being dumbly beautiful for a living. What does it say, though, about his vision that his first evocation of a revolt against convention principally depicted men learning how to use their fists on one another? </p> <p>\"Fight Club came out of something that all my peers talked about,\" he says. \"It is that their fathers had never taught them what they needed to know about becoming men. And what I'm learning more and more is that these fathers had not been taught by their own fathers.\" </p> <p>The book is also informed by knuckle-on-bone experience. Palahniuk, 38, spent several frustrating years trying to make it as a writer of some kind. He worked on trucks by day and went to bars by night where sometimes he became involved in dust-ups. </p> <p>What he derived from these encounters is the curious thing we all learn when we see boxers embrace at the finish of a bout: that a physical contest can also bind the protagonists in mutual respect. Palahniuk is certain that there are some things in life that men innately enjoy and should be given - given back - cultural permission to express. \"If we try to suppress that completely, it is going to erupt in some horrible uncontrolled way. In a culture where we have condemned all forms of violence as invalid and not needed, violence still comes up. It comes up in hyper-violent ways, like in school shootings.\" </p> <p>The notion that men must be allowed to be men or else all society - women included - suffers, is consistent with the mantras of the American men's movement and the mytho-poetic prescriptions of its patron saint, Robert Bly, the author of Iron John. Palahniuk also seems in sympathy with the argument that conventional manly virtues have been done down in the keyboard-driven, postindustrial economy, and he has not missed the irony that while men's interest in violent sports today causes concern, women's incursions into the same territory are often applauded. So when men box it is mindless violence and when women box it is liberation? </p> <p>\"Right.\" </p> <p>For Palahniuk the male protagonists of Fight Club are human spirits in revolt against the deadening destinies society that allots them. Many of his friends are teachers and, like teachers here, they often com plain that education is increasingly about schooling children for niches rather than educating them to create their own place in the world: \"They're taught to accept the world the way it is. I felt that all of my schooling was to get me a good corporate job so I could be a good corporate citizen, pay my taxes, live politely and then die.\" </p> <p>Where Palahniuk was concerned, the system seems to have failed. He has written his own life script instead. He grew up in a trailer in the desert, the part that lies in east Washington state: \"Cactus and sage brush and coyotes. We were really, really poor.\" </p> <p>His mother was an office manager, his father worked on the railroad which came in handy because whenever a freight train was derailed he was the first to know. Some of Palahniuk's most vivid childhood memories are of stealing out en famille at dead of night - he has a brother and two sisters - to pilfer from the train-wreck. </p> <p>It is a story that he makes use of in Invisible Monsters, when one of the characters looks back on a past she is desperate to escape. </p> <p>A thick vein of such dark comedy pulses through his writing. His mother now works in a nuclear- powered factory, and he savours her tales of radioactive mice penetrating the confectionery machines. His father is dead - murdered 18 months ago along with a woman he was dating. The trail of the woman's former husband, who had, allegedly, been threatening to kill her for three years, has just been picked up. \"My father walked in on the end of a chain of events. He happened to be the unhappy man who had answered her personal ad in a magazine.\" </p> <p>Palahniuk thinks that personal catastrophe and conflict can deepen human relationships and make us richer as people: the blood of the fight-club floors, the drug-deranged odyssey of self-mutilation that powers Invisible Monsters. His character, named Brandy Alexander, dazzlingly suspended midway between sexes, lives out a kind of makeover that goes more than skin deep. </p> <p>The novel's narrator is his first in a female voice and addresses the questionable premise underlying Fight Club - that men and women are fundamentally different kinds of humans and that those differences are finally decisive. However, Palahniuk was surprised by the reaction of women to his book. \"I used to believe Fight Club was a men's phenomenon. But I got so much response from women saying that they want that form of expression for themselves. They, too, respond to the notion that sometimes you must destroy if you are going to make things better.\" </p> <p>All of this suggests a different way of making sense out of today's gender flux and clutter. If masculinity means guts and vigour, and a passion for controlling your own destiny, then it is not so much an essence exclusive to one sex as a metaphor that both sexes can make use of.

The stunningly close result is a once in a lifetime political story. The problem is, it was still unclear by the time most morning editions were published.</p> <p>Most of the online papers are getting around the problem by revamping their electronic front pages with agency copy. But with the updates coming thick and fast, the editors must be almost as confused as their readers.</p> <p>With only a handful of ballots to be counted - or recounted - it is clear that Al Gore won the popular vote. But he will almost certainly lose the race for the White House because of the electoral college system.</p> <p>The vice-president would have found it particularly hard to read this morning's <a href=\"http://www.tennessean.com/\" target=\"_new\">Tennessean</a>, the paper for which he once worked as a reporter. It carries a detailed map of his home state where George W Bush scored a clear victory.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/\" target=\"_new\">Chicago Tribune</a> reports another dramatic outcome of the polls: the first ever election of a dead man to the US senate: \" The late Gov Mel Carnahan was victorious early Wednesday over Republican Sen John Ashcroft of Missouri. Carnahan's name stayed on the ballot in spite of his death last month.</p> <p>\"Carnahan's triumph marks the first time a dead person has been elected to the US Senate. His widow, Jean, has agreed to accept an appointment to take his place. From the moment Carnahan's plane crashed on 16 October, nothing about this state's contest for the senate had been simple or predictable, nor would it be on election day.\"</p> <p>Columnist Steve Neal, writing in the <a href=\"http://www.suntimes.com/\" target=\"_new\">Chicago Sun-Times</a>, jumps the gun by discussing the likely administration to be put together by \"president-elect George W Bush\". He predicts that it will feature prominent members of a previous George Bush cabinet, including former army chief Colin Powell as Secretary of State.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/\" target=\"_new\">Los Angeles Times</a> reports the nailbiting last hours of the campaign: \"With the race so taut, Gore continued campaigning relentlessly Tuesday night, even after polls closed in the east and midwest. Manning the phones from his hotel suite in Nashville, he joined his wife, Tipper, and Lieberman in calling radio stations in several states where ballots were still being cast.</p> <p>\"Early in the evening, when several television networks called the vote in Florida, Michigan and Illinois for the vice-president, 'cheers went up around the room' in the Gores' suite, press secretary Douglas Hattaway said. The group took a brief dinner break, he said, then 'got back on the phones'.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.dallasnews.com/\" target=\"_new\">Dallas Morning News</a>, which staunchly backed Bush, is frustrated by the close finish, and gloomily reports that the crucial Florida result, hanging on a handful of postal votes, may prolong the agony: \"Florida election law requires a vote recount if the margin of difference is less than one half of one percent.

      "bodyText": "For editors in the US, the outcome of the presidential election - which may not be finalised until next week - is a dream and a nightmare. The stunningly close result is a once in a lifetime political story. The problem is, it was still unclear by the time most morning editions were published. Most of the online papers are getting around the problem by revamping their electronic front pages with agency copy. But with the updates coming thick and fast, the editors must be almost as confused as their readers. With only a handful of ballots to be counted - or recounted - it is clear that Al Gore won the popular vote. But he will almost certainly lose the race for the White House because of the electoral college system. The vice-president would have found it particularly hard to read this morning's Tennessean, the paper for which he once worked as a reporter. It carries a detailed map of his home state where George W Bush scored a clear victory. The Chicago Tribune reports another dramatic outcome of the polls: the first ever election of a dead man to the US senate: \" The late Gov Mel Carnahan was victorious early Wednesday over Republican Sen John Ashcroft of Missouri. Carnahan's name stayed on the ballot in spite of his death last month. \"Carnahan's triumph marks the first time a dead person has been elected to the US Senate. His widow, Jean, has agreed to accept an appointment to take his place. From the moment Carnahan's plane crashed on 16 October, nothing about this state's contest for the senate had been simple or predictable, nor would it be on election day.\" Columnist Steve Neal, writing in the Chicago Sun-Times, jumps the gun by discussing the likely administration to be put together by \"president-elect George W Bush\". He predicts that it will feature prominent members of a previous George Bush cabinet, including former army chief Colin Powell as Secretary of State. The Los Angeles Times reports the nailbiting last hours of the campaign: \"With the race so taut, Gore continued campaigning relentlessly Tuesday night, even after polls closed in the east and midwest. Manning the phones from his hotel suite in Nashville, he joined his wife, Tipper, and Lieberman in calling radio stations in several states where ballots were still being cast. \"Early in the evening, when several television networks called the vote in Florida, Michigan and Illinois for the vice-president, 'cheers went up around the room' in the Gores' suite, press secretary Douglas Hattaway said. The group took a brief dinner break, he said, then 'got back on the phones'.\" The Dallas Morning News, which staunchly backed Bush, is frustrated by the close finish, and gloomily reports that the crucial Florida result, hanging on a handful of postal votes, may prolong the agony: \"Florida election law requires a vote recount if the margin of difference is less than one half of one percent. Several Florida counties still have absentee ballots to count and elections officials expect several thousand votes from overseas. Elections officials weren't sure how long it would take this time, but said it took 10 days in 1996 to count overseas absentee ballots.\" In the eye of the Florida psephological storm, the Miami Herald jumps both ways at once, reporting that Mr Bush led in the state, then saw his lead evaporate. The paper is breathless: \"The result was astounding: The election of an American president after a campaign that inspired a remarkable nationwide turnout of voters now hinged on uncounted ballots from one precinct in Pompano Beach, a recount of some absentee ballots in Broward and Miami Dade counties, and, eventually, a legally mandated recount of the entire vote in Florida.\" The Herald's unofficial table of results shows Mr Bush leading Mr Gore in Florida by just 1784 votes out of nearly six million.",

Europe's largest ISP has sunk into the red after profits at the rudderless company were hit by a flat-rate billing scheme. T-Online reported a pre-tax loss of E14.4m (\u00a38.7m) for the first nine months of the year, against a profit of E14.2m (\u00a38.6m) last year. Some cheer was provided by the revenue figures, which soared 86% to E542.6m (\u00a3325m), but doubts remain about the ISP's ability to maintain a consistent source of income. T-Online's Frankfurt-listed stock tumbled 5% on the results, falling to E22.30 (\u00a314), compared with the E27 flotation price. The company has been rocked by a series of boardroom resignations over the past few months, including the acrimonious departure of chairman Wolfgang Keuntje. Mr Keuntje is rumoured to have left following disputes over strategy with Ron Sommers, the chairman of parent company Deutsche Telekom. The pair allegedly fell out over a failed bid for UK rival Freeserve. Mr Sommers has drafted in right-hand man Detlev Buchal as acting boss, but has yet to recruit a permanent replacement. The company's chief financial officer and head of marketing have since followed Mr Keuntje out of the door. T-Online is not alone in its problems, however, with UK companies AltaVista UK and LineOne ditching their unmetered services in the summer. Freeserve and Breathe are sticking with their flat-rate schemes, but analysts doubt if the services will work as a long-term money-spinner. Bob Kommers, internet analyst at ABN Amro, said: \"Most of the French, German and British ISPs have pulled back their unmetered services, because they are not economically viable.

      "body": "<p>Chancellor Gordon Brown is expected to make concessions to fuel and pensions campaigners while keeping his reputation for prudence in his pre-budget report today.</p> <p>The latest speculation about his eagerly awaited \"mini-Budget\" centred on plans to slash duty on ultra-low sulphur petrol. It is hoped that this will encourage motorists and oil companies to switch to the supposedly \"greener\" fuel.</p> <p>Mr Brown is expected to announce a boost of at least \u00a35 a week for single pensioners, and \u00a38 a week for couples, and a freeze on fuel duty for conventional petrol and diesel.</p> <p>He has also been tipped to appease truckers by levying a \u00a31,500 charge on foreign drivers operating in Britain.</p> <p>However, Mr Brown and the prime minister, Tony Blair, have both stressed that nothing will be done to jeopardise long-term economic stability by \"blowing\" any of the surplus billions in Treasury coffers to buy short term popularity.</p> <p>The Bank of England governor, Sir Eddie George, has warned a big spending spree would lead to higher interest - and mortgage - rates.</p> <p>MPs are eagerly awaiting Mr Brown's statement in the Commons at 3.30pm, which will set the scene for the next election. This morning, Mr Brown was briefing his cabinet colleagues on the report.</p> <p>The report is supposed to lay the framework for next spring's full Budget. But more announcements than usual are expected today, with a general election widely forecast for next May.</p> <p>Mr Blair has promised Mr Brown will put long-term economic stability \"first, second and third\". But the Tories have continued to press for at least a 3p cut in petrol and diesel duty.</p> <p>Conservatives and Liberal Democrats claimed that any concessions on fuel or pensions would be reluctantly extracted from the chancellor.</p> <p>Tory Treasury spokesman Oliver Letwin said: \"I am sure Gordon Brown would rather not have to make this sort of statement at all.</p> <p>\"He has been dragged kicking and screaming to the altar to do something for pensioners and something for the people who drive.\"</p> <p>Fuel protesters have argued for a 26p cut and threatened a repeat of September's campaign which left motorists panicking at the pumps, the NHS on \"red alert\" and supermarkets with dwindling food supplies if they are not satisfied with the government's actions by 13 November.</p> <p><br><b>Related stories</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/politics/story/0,3604,394223,00.html\">8 November 2000: Pensioners call at No 10 - Guardian</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/budget2000/article/0,2763,394362,00.html\">8 November 2000, explained: the pre-budget report </a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,394122,00.html\">8 November 2000, analysis: My friends the truckers, by Leanda de Lisle</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/pbr2000/index.html\" target=\"_new\">Key player: pre-budget report - HM Treasury</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.peoples-fuel-lobby.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Campaign - People's Fuel Lobby</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.rha.net/fairplay2000/\" target=\"_new\">Key player - the Road Haulage Association</a><br><a href=\"http://www.freighttaxes.com/\" target=\"_new\"> Key player - Freight Taxes.com</a><br><a href=\"http://www.natpencon.org.uk/index.html\" target=\"_new\">Key player - National pensioners convention</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget/1999/index.html\" target=\"_new\">Budgets and pre-budgets since 1994 - HM Treasury</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Chancellor Gordon Brown is expected to make concessions to fuel and pensions campaigners while keeping his reputation for prudence in his pre-budget report today. The latest speculation about his eagerly awaited \"mini-Budget\" centred on plans to slash duty on ultra-low sulphur petrol. It is hoped that this will encourage motorists and oil companies to switch to the supposedly \"greener\" fuel. Mr Brown is expected to announce a boost of at least \u00a35 a week for single pensioners, and \u00a38 a week for couples, and a freeze on fuel duty for conventional petrol and diesel. He has also been tipped to appease truckers by levying a \u00a31,500 charge on foreign drivers operating in Britain. However, Mr Brown and the prime minister, Tony Blair, have both stressed that nothing will be done to jeopardise long-term economic stability by \"blowing\" any of the surplus billions in Treasury coffers to buy short term popularity. The Bank of England governor, Sir Eddie George, has warned a big spending spree would lead to higher interest - and mortgage - rates. MPs are eagerly awaiting Mr Brown's statement in the Commons at 3.30pm, which will set the scene for the next election. This morning, Mr Brown was briefing his cabinet colleagues on the report. The report is supposed to lay the framework for next spring's full Budget. But more announcements than usual are expected today, with a general election widely forecast for next May. Mr Blair has promised Mr Brown will put long-term economic stability \"first, second and third\". But the Tories have continued to press for at least a 3p cut in petrol and diesel duty. Conservatives and Liberal Democrats claimed that any concessions on fuel or pensions would be reluctantly extracted from the chancellor. Tory Treasury spokesman Oliver Letwin said: \"I am sure Gordon Brown would rather not have to make this sort of statement at all. \"He has been dragged kicking and screaming to the altar to do something for pensioners and something for the people who drive.\" Fuel protesters have argued for a 26p cut and threatened a repeat of September's campaign which left motorists panicking at the pumps, the NHS on \"red alert\" and supermarkets with dwindling food supplies if they are not satisfied with the government's actions by 13 November.

      "bodyText": "The captain and crew of the ill-fated bulk carrier Derbyshire were cleared today of any involvement in the sinking of the 160,000-tonne vessel. A second inquiry into the tragedy - in which all 42 crew and two of their wives lost their lives - refuted the findings of an earlier investigation which blamed the sinking on a badly-secured hatch cover. Reporting its findings today, the latest inquiry, headed by a high court judge, put the blame for the disaster on inadequate hatch covers which bent and buckled when the vessel encountered 80ft waves in a Pacific typhoon off the coast of Japan in September 1980. This allowed water to pour into the space above the cargo causing the vessel to plunge deeper, increasing the pressure on other hatch covers which burst and directly led to the massive ship sinking two-and-a-half miles to the bottom. Mr Justice Colman concluded that minimum strength requirements laid down by international convention for massive ships such as the Derbyshire were \"seriously deficient\". He called on the government to press \"strongly and urgently\" for new standards for hatch cover strength. The judge said any amendment should be applicable not only to new ships but all existing bulk carriers because present hatch cover design \"poses an unacceptable risk to the safety of those vessels and their crews\". Mr Justice Colman said the \"tragedy and mystery\" of the sinking of the largest British ship ever lost at sea began in 1980 when it disappeared without trace about 350 miles south east of Japan. The four-year-old vessel was nearly three times the length of the playing area at Wembley stadium, considerably wider than the Titanic or the QE2 and manned by a competent and experienced master and crew, said the judge. \"Not surprisingly, the families of those who perished in this tragedy were extremely anxious to know what had caused such a catastrophic loss of life.\" The first investigation took place between October 1987 and March 1988 and found that the ship was \"probably overwhelmed by the forces of nature\". The Derbyshire Families Association pressed for an underwater survey but the exact location of the vessel was not known until the 1990s. When the technology became available to conduct a survey two-and-a-half miles down, the assessors found from the photographic evidence that the loss had probably been caused by seawater entering the bow section. \"However, the disturbing aspect of this report was that the main reason for entry of seawater into the bosun's store in the first place was found to be the failure of the crew to secure the lid to the hatch on the foredeck,\" said the judge. \"This conclusion clearly involved the imputation of serious negligence against the officers and crew. It was deeply upsetting to the families of those on board.\" The report led the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, to call for a full reopening of the formal investigation.For the first time, it was to be held at the high court. The Derbyshire Families Association had strongly criticised Oceanroutes, an agency which recommends sea routes and which was appointed by the ship's charterers, for failing in its duty to provide adequate information about the typhoon. Mr Justice Colman said his report accepts that the message sent to the vessel by Oceanroutes during the height of the storm was \"seriously deficient\" in information but the agency was not negligent or at fault in failing to advise the master to alter course. \"It can therefore be concluded that the vessel's encounter with the most severe sea conditions of the typhoon arose without the fault either of those on board or of Oceanroutes.\" Stephen Cantor, the families's solicitor, said: \"We are very pleased that there has been complete exoneration and vindication of the crew \u0085 There has been a complete exoneration and vindication of the crew.\" Paul Lambert, the chairman of the Derbyshire Family Association, who lost his 19-year-old brother, Peter, in the tragedy, said: \"This is a vindication of the families and the decision by John Prescott to hold the second inquiry.\" Anne Dowling, from Cornwall, whose father Ali Bujang died on the Derbyshire, said: \"I am still in shock. We have finally got answers after 20 years. Tony Santamera, national secretary of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers, said: \"The crew have been totally exonerated and that fact should be broadcast around the world.\" Related story 3.November: Inquiry clears crew Useful links The Derbyshire inquiry",

      "bodyText": "The Belfast Telegraph has scooped the award for internet site of the year in the Newspaper Society's first ever new media awards. But significantly there were no entries for the category of \"most commercially successful internet publisher\". The awards mark the first time that the society has awarded gongs for regional press internet sites. But in the increasingly competitive world of regional publishing, no newspaper group was confident enough to enter the category that rewarded financial success. Judges said the Belfast Telegraph site provided \"great depth of content and numerous interactive features ensuring it remains at the forefront of technological development\". Other winners included Kent Messenger Group's Kentonline, which won the award for the best internet site from a weekly newspaper. Cambridge Evening News's Cambridge News Online won the award for best innovation in digital publishing, while Eastern County Newspapers' pinkun.com won the best niche internet site award.",

The flat-rate service was initially only available to existing AOL members and cynics said at the time of launch that AOL might drag its heels on rolling out the service to non-members. From Monday, consumers can pick up AOL Flat-rate CDs from any Asda supermarket, call a number or register for the call-free service for \u00a314.99 per month at aol.co.uk. Buoyed by public interest surrounding the flat-fee plan when it launched at the start of September, AOL claims that its overall UK membership has passed the landmark figure of 1m customers. The extended roll-out coincides with the launch of AOL's new mobile offerings - a Wap service and SMS text messaging from a PC to a phone. AOL UK managing director Karen Thomson said; \"Today marks an historic turning point for the interactive medium in this country, as we at AOL UK are fulfilling our pledge to 'Stop the Clock' for UK consumers.\"",

It is estimated that the total cost to Punch of the case, including costs for both sides, could come to over \u00a3150,000. He added that the government had failed to prove that the Shayler article represented a threat to national security: the reason government lawyers claimed that the injunction had been imposed. A crucial element in the judgement had been Punch's decision to publish - on its front cover - a letter from government lawyers warning the magazine that publication of the article would breach a 1997 injunction. The judge said he believed the letter had been published to increase sales. But Mr Steen claimed that after Punch received the letter, journalists had made the necessary changes to Mr Shayler's article to prevent breaches of national security. \"I agree that you can't go around breaking injunctions, but you have to look at the injunction on its merits,\" he added. Freedom of speech campaigners condemned the ruling, but Index on Censorship's Rohan Jayasekera said the case could be good because the decision was so \"perverse\".

      "body": "<p>Nick Hornby attracts more than his share of envy. Perhaps this is inevitable for such a successful author, but there is also something about the artless, plain style of both the writer and his work that makes people think, \"I wish I'd thought of that: I could have done that.\" The idea that someone might have a popular literary career founded on a memoir of being a football fan seems almost a provocation. And yet how many people would wish for his life if they knew how much it revolves around the needs of his autistic son Danny? If they had any idea of what life with an autistic child is like? </p> <p>Hornby is just completing his third novel, but he has only ever written one brief newspaper article about Danny and autism. This week sees the publication of Speaking With the Angel, a collection of new short stories edited by Hornby. The line-up is stellar (Roddy Doyle, Helen Fielding, Robert Harris, Irvine Welsh, Zadie Smith . . .); the common theme that the stories are all first-person narratives. But the object of the collection is to raise money (\u00a31 on every copy sold) for TreeHouse, the special school that Hornby and his ex-wife Virginia Bovell co-founded with several other parents of autistic children. </p> <p>Besides contributing a story, Hornby has written an introduction which explains with eloquently suppressed anger why there is a need for schools like TreeHouse - because there is so little appropriate educational provision for the UK's 76,000 autistic children, or support for their families. And he describes in brief but telling detail a day in the life of not necessarily his own, but a typical family with an autistic kid: </p> <p>\"He sleeps five or six hours every night, in fact, which means that if he can be kept awake until, say, nine, then he will wake up at two or three. He is upset and frustrated, so he screams, and his parents, who have maybe slept three or four hours, feel a mixture of exhaustion and depression and panic - they live in a small flat, and the walls are thin, and they know that they are not the only ones who are disturbed on a nightly basis . . . It is six hours until one of them starts work (the other would like to work, but in the absence of any suitable school place for the child, it is not possible), by which time the child will have attempted to hurt himself by hitting himself hard and repeatedly on the head, and maybe thrown some food around, and refused to use the toilet and ended up soiling a carpet, and demanded in the only language he has at his disposal (one word, repeated with increasing force and volume) to go out to the park, even though it's pitch black outside . . .\" It goes on. Hornby, you know, has been there. </p> <p>We meet at a Turkish restaurant in Highbury, not far from his beloved Arsenal ground. He orders egg and chips and a mineral water, and lights up a Silk Cut. </p> <p>\"It seems to me a song about disability,\" he says, explaining how he borrowed the book's title from a track by Canadian singer-songwriter Ron Sexsmith. \"It's almost an autistic trait - lots of staring up into the sky and off into the distance. There does seem to be a sort of communion with something that you can't see.\" </p> <p>Danny was born in 1993. He was diagnosed with autism nearly five years ago, which is actually very young: the average age of diagnosis is nearer the age he is now, seven. This fact in itself means that many parents suffer an agony of anxiety and uncertainty about their child's developmental and behavioural problems before they even hear an official pronouncement of \"autism\". </p> <p>\"His birth was extremely difficult,\" Hornby says, \"so I think we both suspect that his condition is in some way connected to that. Danny got stuck, and there was an emergency Caesarean. It was a scary night. </p> <p>\"When he was born he had a left-sided weakness. His head was down on one side, and he's got a droopy eye. Something seems to be affected down his left side, although most of the physical symptoms have been corrected except for the eye. I would imagine it would have been some sort of brain damage. And that the part of his brain that was affected would be the part that would result in autistic symptoms. </p> <p>\"Lots of parents whose kids are autistic suspect nothing until their kids are 15-18 months old. Because of Danny's birth difficulties, there had always been some slight worries about his development, but when he was 18 months he lost the language that he'd acquired more or less completely. He became almost catatonic. He didn't want to go out very much, and would not make eye-contact with anyone who wasn't me or his mum. There are phrases, little words that he had then which have still not come back. </p> <p>So when did he and Virginia realise Danny was autistic? </p> <p>\"I think the word autism was floating about somewhere. I still remember it was something of a shock going for the first meeting in that we had a really bad time. We went to the health centre locally where there was a paediatric specialist. He was quite flustered. He looked at Danny - and at this stage we were still very tentative about what the problem was - and he suddenly said: 'Global development delay . . . don't really know . . . the hardest time is when he's five or six; he'll be much further behind the other kids . . .' </p> <p>\"It was all a million words a second and devastating information. That was the real shock day. But then it was a year after that that Danny was finally diagnosed autistic. By then it was no surprise: we had come to our own conclusions. It seemed fairly certain to us.\" </p> <p>Autism is, as Hornby says, \"a very, very wide term\" - a spectrum condition: \"It can be anything from not being able to recognise your own parents to being a bit funny when you're studying Maths at Oxford.\" Danny is probably somewhere towards the more severe end of that continuum, but each autistic child has particular characteristics, their own specific deficits of language acquisition and socialisation. </p> <p>The common feature of autists is that they do not copy and therefore cannot learn as normal children do. Locked in their own private world, they are very sensitive about their personal space and ignore or actively repel attempts to engage with them. And, left to their own devices, autistic children often resort to extremely repetitive behaviour. TreeHouse's approach is a constant effort to break down the barriers autists erect around themselves, to socialise them seemingly despite themselves. </p> <p>TreeHouse, which now looks after 20 children daily for an extended school year, uses a system imported from the US called Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA). Hornby takes me to see it. In the newest class, one teacher seeks to get a child who cries and constantly turns away from him to follow a simple drill. Compliance is encouraged by lots of praise, rewards, cuddles and tickles. To witness the therapy you might think it utterly thankless and pointless; but the results are also evident. In an older class, the children are sitting around having a picture-book story read to them. In the context, astonishing progress. </p> <p>\"The process has gone far enough with Danny that he is beginning to spark a bit now,\" says Hornby. \"He is discovering more toys. He does become bored more easily. We are definitely seeing the benefits.\" Danny even has a friend at TreeHouse: Toby. Until lately, this was inconceivable. </p> <p>Another two schools, one in Wandsworth and another in Surrey, have just opened using the same system. Like TreeHouse, they have been voluntarily founded and are voluntarily funded. Five London boroughs now pay for children to attend TreeHouse, but before that few made much provision for autistic children. Hornby prefers not to be specific about the extent of his personal investment in the school, but he has signed a film deal for About a Boy and big publishing contract with Penguin \"and TreeHouse has got a reasonable chunk of both of those\". </p> <p> TreeHouse, which is now housed in borrowed premises in Bloomsbury, began in a room in a library at Swiss Cottage in north London. Hornby quips: \"It could almost be a figure of speech like 'a bull in a china shop': 'an autistic kid in a library'.\" Humour, the kind of deadpan black humour that Hornby likes, seems to be a survival strategy he has developed. </p> <p>\"There is a lot about autism that is very funny, and you'd have to be the parent of an autistic child to appreciate it,\" Hornby explains. </p> <p>\"Yesterday when I picked him up from school and we'd got back to the house, he had to come out again because we hadn't rung the doorbell. I don't know where that's come from. It's clearly something new that's just started, but it's done with such a neutral face that it's actually very funny.\" </p> <p>Danny is doing well at school but, while there is no prognosis for autism, Hornby knows he has to be realistic about Danny's progress and his future: \"Autism, more than any other condition, leaves the parents with the sense that there might suddenly one day be a breakthrough,\" he says. But he feels it is \"unhealthy\" to hold out too much hope of improvement, especially since autists seem to resist change. </p> <p>\"There are weird things like almost a constant need to be misunderstood,\" Hornby observes, \"so that the language he has acquired, which is in itself obscure, he then changes subtly - as if you're understanding too much, which is an odd thing. </p> <p>\"'Tata' is his word for bread and peanut butter, but just about three or four weeks ago it's become 'Shasha', for no reason that I can fathom. </p> <p>\"There is a great temptation every now and then to say: 'Cut this out, Danny. You know and I know . . . The joke's over.' Really!\" </p> <p>The TreeHouse curriculum includes drama and PE: \"I don't know what they do in drama,\" Hornby chuckles with rueful irony. \"It always says on his report at the end of the day, 'Danny did very well in drama today.'\" </p> <p>But there hasn't been a school production yet? \"Not as such.

In the same way that you'd be appalled by a parent obsessed with having a boy who wasn't really interested in having a girl. I think that sense of who he is takes over very quickly, and you think: 'OK, I've got a kid who doesn't want to play football, doesn't want to read, and that's my kid and I love my kid.'

      "bodyText": "Nick Hornby attracts more than his share of envy. Perhaps this is inevitable for such a successful author, but there is also something about the artless, plain style of both the writer and his work that makes people think, \"I wish I'd thought of that: I could have done that.\" The idea that someone might have a popular literary career founded on a memoir of being a football fan seems almost a provocation. And yet how many people would wish for his life if they knew how much it revolves around the needs of his autistic son Danny? If they had any idea of what life with an autistic child is like? Hornby is just completing his third novel, but he has only ever written one brief newspaper article about Danny and autism. This week sees the publication of Speaking With the Angel, a collection of new short stories edited by Hornby. The line-up is stellar (Roddy Doyle, Helen Fielding, Robert Harris, Irvine Welsh, Zadie Smith . . .); the common theme that the stories are all first-person narratives. But the object of the collection is to raise money (\u00a31 on every copy sold) for TreeHouse, the special school that Hornby and his ex-wife Virginia Bovell co-founded with several other parents of autistic children. Besides contributing a story, Hornby has written an introduction which explains with eloquently suppressed anger why there is a need for schools like TreeHouse - because there is so little appropriate educational provision for the UK's 76,000 autistic children, or support for their families. And he describes in brief but telling detail a day in the life of not necessarily his own, but a typical family with an autistic kid: \"He sleeps five or six hours every night, in fact, which means that if he can be kept awake until, say, nine, then he will wake up at two or three. He is upset and frustrated, so he screams, and his parents, who have maybe slept three or four hours, feel a mixture of exhaustion and depression and panic - they live in a small flat, and the walls are thin, and they know that they are not the only ones who are disturbed on a nightly basis . . . It is six hours until one of them starts work (the other would like to work, but in the absence of any suitable school place for the child, it is not possible), by which time the child will have attempted to hurt himself by hitting himself hard and repeatedly on the head, and maybe thrown some food around, and refused to use the toilet and ended up soiling a carpet, and demanded in the only language he has at his disposal (one word, repeated with increasing force and volume) to go out to the park, even though it's pitch black outside . . .\" It goes on. Hornby, you know, has been there. We meet at a Turkish restaurant in Highbury, not far from his beloved Arsenal ground. He orders egg and chips and a mineral water, and lights up a Silk Cut. \"It seems to me a song about disability,\" he says, explaining how he borrowed the book's title from a track by Canadian singer-songwriter Ron Sexsmith. \"It's almost an autistic trait - lots of staring up into the sky and off into the distance. There does seem to be a sort of communion with something that you can't see.\" Danny was born in 1993. He was diagnosed with autism nearly five years ago, which is actually very young: the average age of diagnosis is nearer the age he is now, seven. This fact in itself means that many parents suffer an agony of anxiety and uncertainty about their child's developmental and behavioural problems before they even hear an official pronouncement of \"autism\". \"His birth was extremely difficult,\" Hornby says, \"so I think we both suspect that his condition is in some way connected to that. Danny got stuck, and there was an emergency Caesarean. It was a scary night. \"When he was born he had a left-sided weakness. His head was down on one side, and he's got a droopy eye. Something seems to be affected down his left side, although most of the physical symptoms have been corrected except for the eye. I would imagine it would have been some sort of brain damage. And that the part of his brain that was affected would be the part that would result in autistic symptoms. \"Lots of parents whose kids are autistic suspect nothing until their kids are 15-18 months old. Because of Danny's birth difficulties, there had always been some slight worries about his development, but when he was 18 months he lost the language that he'd acquired more or less completely. He became almost catatonic. He didn't want to go out very much, and would not make eye-contact with anyone who wasn't me or his mum. There are phrases, little words that he had then which have still not come back. So when did he and Virginia realise Danny was autistic? \"I think the word autism was floating about somewhere. I still remember it was something of a shock going for the first meeting in that we had a really bad time. We went to the health centre locally where there was a paediatric specialist. He was quite flustered. He looked at Danny - and at this stage we were still very tentative about what the problem was - and he suddenly said: 'Global development delay . . . don't really know . . . the hardest time is when he's five or six; he'll be much further behind the other kids . . .' \"It was all a million words a second and devastating information. That was the real shock day. But then it was a year after that that Danny was finally diagnosed autistic. By then it was no surprise: we had come to our own conclusions. It seemed fairly certain to us.\" Autism is, as Hornby says, \"a very, very wide term\" - a spectrum condition: \"It can be anything from not being able to recognise your own parents to being a bit funny when you're studying Maths at Oxford.\" Danny is probably somewhere towards the more severe end of that continuum, but each autistic child has particular characteristics, their own specific deficits of language acquisition and socialisation. The common feature of autists is that they do not copy and therefore cannot learn as normal children do. Locked in their own private world, they are very sensitive about their personal space and ignore or actively repel attempts to engage with them. And, left to their own devices, autistic children often resort to extremely repetitive behaviour. TreeHouse's approach is a constant effort to break down the barriers autists erect around themselves, to socialise them seemingly despite themselves. TreeHouse, which now looks after 20 children daily for an extended school year, uses a system imported from the US called Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA). Hornby takes me to see it. In the newest class, one teacher seeks to get a child who cries and constantly turns away from him to follow a simple drill. Compliance is encouraged by lots of praise, rewards, cuddles and tickles. To witness the therapy you might think it utterly thankless and pointless; but the results are also evident. In an older class, the children are sitting around having a picture-book story read to them. In the context, astonishing progress. \"The process has gone far enough with Danny that he is beginning to spark a bit now,\" says Hornby. \"He is discovering more toys. He does become bored more easily. We are definitely seeing the benefits.\" Danny even has a friend at TreeHouse: Toby. Until lately, this was inconceivable. Another two schools, one in Wandsworth and another in Surrey, have just opened using the same system. Like TreeHouse, they have been voluntarily founded and are voluntarily funded. Five London boroughs now pay for children to attend TreeHouse, but before that few made much provision for autistic children. Hornby prefers not to be specific about the extent of his personal investment in the school, but he has signed a film deal for About a Boy and big publishing contract with Penguin \"and TreeHouse has got a reasonable chunk of both of those\". TreeHouse, which is now housed in borrowed premises in Bloomsbury, began in a room in a library at Swiss Cottage in north London. Hornby quips: \"It could almost be a figure of speech like 'a bull in a china shop': 'an autistic kid in a library'.\" Humour, the kind of deadpan black humour that Hornby likes, seems to be a survival strategy he has developed. \"There is a lot about autism that is very funny, and you'd have to be the parent of an autistic child to appreciate it,\" Hornby explains. \"Yesterday when I picked him up from school and we'd got back to the house, he had to come out again because we hadn't rung the doorbell. I don't know where that's come from. It's clearly something new that's just started, but it's done with such a neutral face that it's actually very funny.\" Danny is doing well at school but, while there is no prognosis for autism, Hornby knows he has to be realistic about Danny's progress and his future: \"Autism, more than any other condition, leaves the parents with the sense that there might suddenly one day be a breakthrough,\" he says. But he feels it is \"unhealthy\" to hold out too much hope of improvement, especially since autists seem to resist change. \"There are weird things like almost a constant need to be misunderstood,\" Hornby observes, \"so that the language he has acquired, which is in itself obscure, he then changes subtly - as if you're understanding too much, which is an odd thing. \"'Tata' is his word for bread and peanut butter, but just about three or four weeks ago it's become 'Shasha', for no reason that I can fathom. \"There is a great temptation every now and then to say: 'Cut this out, Danny. You know and I know . . . The joke's over.' Really!\" The TreeHouse curriculum includes drama and PE: \"I don't know what they do in drama,\" Hornby chuckles with rueful irony. \"It always says on his report at the end of the day, 'Danny did very well in drama today.'\" But there hasn't been a school production yet? \"Not as such. Nor indeed a school football team.\" He jokes, but this must be a very real loss to him. \"The only real way to survive is not to dwell on what isn't going to happen,\" he responds. \"It is about living day to day with the pleasures I get from being with Dan. \"I think what kicks in is a sense of loyalty to him. In the same way that you'd be appalled by a parent obsessed with having a boy who wasn't really interested in having a girl. I think that sense of who he is takes over very quickly, and you think: 'OK, I've got a kid who doesn't want to play football, doesn't want to read, and that's my kid and I love my kid.' It would seem like a great act of disloyalty to him to wish he was some other way.\" Yet the strain of bringing up an autistic child has exacted a price. Although he speaks to and sees Virginia every day because of Danny, the couple are now divorced. The pressure of looking after Danny was, Hornby concedes, \"a huge part\" of why the marriage broke down. \"Obviously there are other things as well, but you never know whether they would have actually counted for anything, had we not had this,\" he elaborates. \"It's like a barium meal. It exposes immediately whatever flaws there are. You can imagine a lot of couples who stay married with the same flaws but they kind of rub along fine, and maybe they have another child, and there's not even the time to examine. \"Having Danny is like the stress of having a newborn permanently - that kind of disruption with a newborn's first weeks, and there's no change to that.\" How happy is Hornby now? A pause. \"Not thinking too far ahead is one trick,\" he says carefully. \"Basically, each stage of Danny's life seems just about cope-able with if you've got the right systems in place . . . For anyone who has any kind of crisis to deal with of a permanent nature, then eventually things fall around it. And, yes, writing is a solace and an escape.

      "bodyText": "India In the opening round of matches in the South Zone of the first-class Ranji Trophy, VVS Laxman almost single-handedly saved Hyderabad from a heavy defeat at the hands of Karnataka in Bangalore. After being asked to follow on with a first-innings deficit of 254, Hyderabad looked to be heading for defeat, but Laxman responded with an unbeaten 100 to steer his side towards a draw. Earlier Karnataka had amassed 545-9 declared in their first innings, thanks to 122 from wicketkeeper V Naidu and 92 from Sunil Joshi. Hyderabad could manage only 291 in their first innings, the major contributors being D Manohar (73), Vinay Kumar (68) and Laxman (60).

He made 105 in his side's first innings score of 283, and then went on to make 118* out of a total of 189-1 as MP were asked to follow on.

Punjab racked up 526-7 declared, with an opening partnership of 277 between Vikram Rathour (203) and R Ricky (113) being followed by 125* from No. 3 Reetinder Sodhi.

Meanwhile Ashish Nehra took 6-31 in Services' second innings as they collapsed to 99 all out in pursuit of 268 against Delhi.

Needing 276 to win in their second innings Easterns were staggering at 93-4 before Crookes (117) and Pierre de Bruyn (71*) took matters in hand against an EP attack missing both Nantie Hayward and Meyrick Pringle.

      "bodyText": "It was Jonathan Plunkett's moment of truth. The Oxford graduate who recently landed a job as The Sun's TV editor showed off his true colours in a journalists-only special edition of Anne Robinson's The Weakest Link. He saw off seven lesser rivals, including the Guardian's learned media correspondent, Matt Wells, The Independent's distinguished media and culture editor editor David Lister and the Mail feature writer Jane Kelly. Here we reprint the highlights of this unrecorded edition, staged at the BBC's TV centre yesterday, including details of The Walk of Shame, the losers' tantrums and of course Ms Robinson's harshest put-downs. Highlights of Round One # Anne's comment to David Lister when he failed to define cornucopia - \"Don't you use words like cornucopia on the Independent, David?\" He replied: \"Only in the headlines\" # Referred to Round One's \u00a3200 as \"pathetic\" # Jane Kelly of the Mail voted off having got one question wrong: \"Which film provided John Travolta with four UK top 20 hit singles in 1978?\" The answer was Grease. # Sharon Marshall, feature writer at the People, was the strongest link Round Two # Robinson haughtily asked the remaining people if they were sure of the rules because no one had banked any money. # When asking contestants to vote for the weakest link, she shrilled: \"Who is the most stupid of those left? Who is an embarrassment to their newspaper?\" # Anne said that this was the lowest second round in the history of the game Round Three # Anne asked who was \"too dense\" to stay? David Lister voted off # Jonathan Plunkett got asked \"Who is head of an Abbey\" and he didn't know it was an abbott. When Anne asked him how he got it wrong he answered: \"We only do vicars\". Round Four # Matt Wells didn't know which US state was called the \"Empire State\" (Answer is New York, not Washington) # Anne asked: \"Who is even more of a dunce than the rest of you\" - Claire Goldwin of the Mirror voted off. # Anne asked Anjali Kwatra from The Express how long she had been in newspapers. AK answered: \"One month\", to which Anne replied by asking: \"How long do you intend to stay in newspapers?\" Round Five # \"Whose knowledge is dismal and embarrassing?\" # A tie between Jonathan Plunkett and Caitlin Moran led to Anjali voting as the strongest link for Caitlin to do the Walk of Shame Round Six # \"Who is too stupid to stay in the studio?\" # Matt Wells voted off. Robinson said it would give him more time to read # Anjali studied Social and Political Science but got a question about Che Guevara wrong. The final head-to-head between Anjali and Jon with Jon winning a final prize of \u00a32,050, one of the lowest ever final prizes. And here are some of the incorrect questions and answers: Caitlin Moran, The Times Caitlin answered a total of eight questions; five right and three wrong The three wrong were: In maths, which has the greater volume - two pints or one litre? # Answered: two pints (Correct: one litre) In history which American outlaw born in 1866 was the best known member of the Wild Bunch gang? Answered: Butch Cassidy (Correct: Robert Leroy Parker) Sharon Marshall, Sunday People Answered three questions; one right and two wrong. The wrong questions were: Which British prime minister flew to Munich to meet Adolf Hitler in 1938? Answered: Churchill (Answer: Chamberlain). Which English horror writer's first novel The Rats was published in 1974? Answered: Stephen King (Answer: James Herbert). Claire Goldwin, The Mirror Answered six questions; three right and three wrong. The three wrong questions were: In literature who wrote the novel 'Travels with My Aunt'? Which British Monarch whilst Prince of Wales, married the Mrs Maria Fitzherbert? In the animal kingdom frogs toads and newts belong to which vertebrates? Jane Kelly, Mail Answered one question and got it wrong - voted off first. See above, Round One Matt Wells Answered 10 questions; seven right and three wrong. In the animal kingdom what 'm' is the North American term for Elk? In the radio series The Archers Sid Perks is the landlord of which pub? Which US state is nicknamed the Empire State?. Answered Washington (answer New York). Jonathan Plunkett, the Sun Answered 18 questions in total including the head-to-head; 15 right and three wrong. What \"A\" is the name given to the male head or superior of a monastery or abbey? Which veteran entertainer uses the catchphrase, \"I wanna tell you a story\"? What was the name of the spacecraft in which Yuri Gagarin became the first man in space? David Lister, the Independent Answered six questions; three right and three wrong. The word cornucopia is another term for \"The Horn of\" what?\" In cookery, what 'm' is a small biscuit or cake made from ground almonds egg white and sugar? Anjali Kwatra, Express Answered 20 questions incuding the head to head; 11 right and nine wrong. What kind of food are pitta and sourdough? Which Queen, the wife of William IV, gave her nane to a major city in South Australia? At which cricket test ground is there a Warwick Road end? Old Trafford or Trent Bridge? What J is both a small British bird and a girl's name? Which prominent figure of the Cuban revolution who first name is Ernesto, died in Bolivia in 1967? In temperature what is the equivalent of 50 degrees F in celsius? Which US president is traditionally supposed to have written his famous Gettysburg Address on the back of an envelope? In literature, which character created by Muriel Spark aimed to make her girls the creme de la creme? Which animal has a male called a boar, a female called a sow, young called a cub and the group name a sleuth? And the losers' comments from the Walk of Shame Jane Q: So how does it feel to be voted off The Weakest Link? A: Pretty bad Q: Who do think will be voted off next? A: Might be Claire, she's losing her nerve. Sharon Q: How does it feel to be voted off? A: I am burning with humiliation and shame. Q: Why did you vote for Anjali? A: I just wanted someone else to go. Q: How did it feel to make the Walk of Shame? A: It's longer than it looks. Q: How does you feel? A: Pretty stupid! Wish I'd listened to my history teacher. Q: Who do you want to be voted off next? A: Matt for that last comment. Q: Do think its fair that you were voted off? A: It's so harsh! Totally unfair just because of one little prime minister. David Q: How do you feel? A: I feel aggrieved and hard done by, I got half of them right. Q: Who do you think will be voted off next? A: I think it will be Matt, because of the usual Guardian smugness and he banks rather than thinks about the questions Q: Are you kicking yourself about that wrong answer? A: yes particularly as I love macaroons. Q: Who do you think will be next? A: Caitlin because she is seven-and-a-half months pregnant and she can't stand up for much longer. Claire Q: How do you feel? A: I feel deeply, deeply humiliated. Q: Why did you vote off Caitlin? A: To be honest I can't remember, I think she hesitated. Q: How do you think you performed? A: Pretty poor. Q: Who do you think will win? A: Matt may win, he's quite cunning. Q: Who do you think will be next off? A: Caitlin, because she hesitates. Caitlin Q: How do you feel? A: Quite chuffed that I stayed so long. Q: How do you feel about Anjali voting you off? A: good to be sitting down, cheers! Q: You weren't actually the Weakest Link, Matt was, how do you feel about that? A: Well it make sense, having seen the show he's the sort of person people like - he's a cheeky chappie everybody loves him. Q: Who do you think will be off next? A: I think it'll be a grudge match between Anjali and Jon - well she's the strongest link but Matt is the cheeky chappie so that leaves Jon. Matt Q: You were the strongest link, but you were voted off, how do you feel? A: Its a travesty of justice and an insult to my intelligence. Q: Who would you least like to see win? A: I would least like to see Jon, because retribution is an unattractive trait in anyone. Q: Who do you think will win? A: Jon may win because good never wins over evil. Anjali Q: How does it feel? A: Congratulations to Jon. He deserves to win.",

Even though I had performed the best in that round, Annie turned to me and declared: \"Matt, you are the weakest link.\" Compounding my sense of rejection, she turned away even before she got to the final, mocking \"Goodbye!\" </p> <p>At the losers' interview, I was asked how it felt to be voted off despite having been the strongest. \"It's a travesty of justice and an insult to my intelligence,\" I complained. </p> <p>I could only console myself with the prediction of Rupert Murdoch, who once famously said that only three newspapers would survive in Britain - the Sun, the Mail and one broadsheet.

The unions and the black churches delivered for Mr Gore in industrial states such as Michigan and ethni cally-diverse areas; the Christian coalition and gun lobby backed Bush in the south and the mountain states.</p> <p>It may have been the most expensive presidential race in history. But the key determinant was not turnover but turnout. So strong were the numbers in Missouri that they kept the polls open to keep up with the demand. It was not how many of the undecided Gore or Bush could convince to come their way that mattered, but how many of those who had long ago made up their minds they could convince to come out and vote.</p> <p>The key battle lines at the polls are the same as those in most other spheres of America - sex, race, class and religion. Bush scored well with men, whites, protestants and the rich while Gore triumphed among women, blacks, Hispanics, Jews and the poor. \"[Blacks] were energised,\" said the Florida state Democratic party chairman, Bob Poe in one of the crucial states.</p> <p>\"|It was only up to us to get them mobilised and we did that, we got the job done.\"</p> <p>Character certainly mattered. Voters looking for honesty and strong leadership went for Mr Bush, according to a poll based on interviews with almost 7,000 voters.

Despite the presidential candidates' expensive efforts to reach out to voters in the centre, it was their ability to motivate their core support that really counted. The unions and the black churches delivered for Mr Gore in industrial states such as Michigan and ethni cally-diverse areas; the Christian coalition and gun lobby backed Bush in the south and the mountain states. It may have been the most expensive presidential race in history. But the key determinant was not turnover but turnout. So strong were the numbers in Missouri that they kept the polls open to keep up with the demand. It was not how many of the undecided Gore or Bush could convince to come their way that mattered, but how many of those who had long ago made up their minds they could convince to come out and vote. The key battle lines at the polls are the same as those in most other spheres of America - sex, race, class and religion. Bush scored well with men, whites, protestants and the rich while Gore triumphed among women, blacks, Hispanics, Jews and the poor. \"[Blacks] were energised,\" said the Florida state Democratic party chairman, Bob Poe in one of the crucial states. \"|It was only up to us to get them mobilised and we did that, we got the job done.\" Character certainly mattered. Voters looking for honesty and strong leadership went for Mr Bush, according to a poll based on interviews with almost 7,000 voters. Those seeking a candidate with experience and an understanding of complex issues went to Mr Gore. But ultimately the vast majority of voters remained loyal to the party rather than the person. Four out of five Clinton supporters from 1996 went for Mr Gore; Nine out of ten of those who backed Bob Dole supported Mr Bush. African-American voters were vital to Democratic fortunes.

      "bodyText": "The George W Bush election headquarters scrambled last night to mobilise its supporters in the western states after its strategy to hold the eastern seaboard collapsed in the face of heavy turnout in urban Democratic strongholds. The Texan crowd which gathered on a chilly night outside the state capitol in Austin had come to celebrate but spent much of the evening biting their fingernails as Vice- President Al Gore scored victories in the eastern swing states. \"It's still OK. It's still OK,\" the compere at the rally told them, as he introduced one country and western singer after another. But for the Republican faithful, the loss of Florida, Michigan and Pennsylvania sunk in like body blows. Carol and Stan TenEyck listened to the Pennsylvania result in silence. \"That hurts,\" Carol said. \"That's pretty bad.\" Further bad news was to come. On big screens on each corner of the rally, Hillary Clinton's smiling face appeared - the Republican nemesis had just been confirmed in the New York Senate seat. The crowd booed heartily. \"I'm a bit nervous,\" Rose Beddingfield said. \"I wouldn't like the Anti-Christ to be in the White House.\" She confirmed she was referring to Al Gore. A moment of sweet revenge arrived with Mr Bush's win in the vice-president's home state, Tennessee, and hopes were once more buoyed. The effort to counter the power of the unions and the black American vote in the great eastern cities, by relying on issue-oriented groups like the National Rifle Association and the anti-abortion movement had failed. Everything, it seemed, would depend on the west. The Republican party chairman, Jim Nicholson, urged Republican voters to turn up in strength in western states, telling reporters: \"It's not over 'til its over.\" After news of defeats in Florida, Michigan and Pennsylvania, Governor Bush changed his plans and decided not to watch the rest of the results come in on a bank of television sets which had been set up in the Four Seasons Hotel in Austin. Instead, he went home to the governor's mansion with his parents. \"He preferred to be at home,\" Gordon Johndroe, a Bush spokesman said. \"His own home was more relaxing.\" Like speculators who had gambled everything on a single investment, Mr Bush and his backers had earlier assembled under torrential rain in Texas to discover if the most expensive campaign in US history had paid off. At the centre of the action was Karl Rove, the Bush strategist, who shuttled between the campaign headquarters and the hotel armed with a notepad and a calculator for instant analysis of the shifting balance in the electoral college. Exuding the studied opti mism which the Bush campaign had made its signature, Mr Rove predicted winning 320 of the 538 votes in the electoral college, which formally determines the presidency under the constitution. His confidence, however, belied a nervous mood in the plush party headquarters. Some of the well-dressed staffers were actively discussing the possibility of winning the popular vote and narrowly losing the contest in the electoral college. In that case, one said: \"There should be pressure put on the delegates to reflect the national will.\" All but two states - Maine and Nebraska - cast their votes in the electoral college on a winner-takes-all basis, but delegates have been known to defy the majority vote in their states and switch their vote. Anticipating an agonisingly close finish, the Bush campaign set aside $80m for an effort in the last two weeks to mobilise its core supporters. Officials said 110m pamphlets had been posted and 62m phone calls had been made.",

Both rivals captured important gains in back-and-forth swings of fortune in the vital battleground states as Democrats and Republican mobilised to the wire to capture every available vote in all 50 states. Defying pundits who had mostly predicted a narrow Republican win, Mr Gore mounted a powerful all-night challenge to keep the White House in Democratic hands for a third term, winning Michigan and Pennsylvania, as well as taking Maine. But Florida, declared a win for Gore on the basis of exit polls, was then early this morning declared too close to call as new polling information suggested a possible Bush victory. On a night of extraordinary political excitement in the world's most important democracy, Hillary Clinton appeared to have made history by becoming the first president's wife to be elected to public office. Exit polls showed her capturing a New York Senate seat. President Clinton was confident. He said: \"I am the first president in history with a wife in the Senate and I like it.\" Mr Bush was sweeping the South, including his own power base in Texas, but Mr Gore's strong early showing knocked Republicans back on their heels and meant Mr Bush had to win a long list of small and middle-ranking swing states if he was to win an election that had seemed to be his for the taking. \"It's going to be a long, late night,\" Mr Bush said in Austin. \"Our people are still working like mad out there.\" The Bush camp bitterly disputed the early media prediction that Florida had gone to Mr Gore and predicted that postal votes would push the state into the Bush column.

Democrats were also ahead in six swing Senate seats, and were losing to the Republicans in two others, suggesting that the Republicans may just retain control of the 100-seat body. So close was the race for votes during the day that in a dramatic move yesterday afternoon, the Gore campaign hastily deployed top vote-getters and extra helpers into Pennsylvania and New Hampshire. Mr Gore sent Jesse Jackson to Philadelphia, the main city in Pennsylvania, and asked Senator Edward Kennedy to deploy more than 100 extra trade union volunteers to stump for votes in New Hampshire. Turnout was reported to be extremely high in several keenly contested areas, with well over 70% voting in Detroit and Miami.

A Democrat spokesman also claimed that the Republicans were playing the \"race card\" by warning voters in predominantly white areas that a vote for the Democrats could lead to the arrival of low income housing in their area. The veteran Democrat senator, Edward Kennedy, was also asked to mobilise more than 100 activists in New Hampshire as both sides threw desperate efforts into getting the vote out. Early on the Democrats had declared themselves pleased with the indication that there was going to be a high turnout of voters in the states that mattered most to them.. Mr Gore voted in his home town of Carthage, not far from Nashville, after an extraordinary sweep through 11 states, an indication of how tight the contest was seen to be right to the last moment. His final campaign appearance before voting started was in Tampa, Florida, where he met a group of night-shift care workers at 4am.

Jon Corzine, the 53-year-old former chairman of Goldman Sachs, won the New Jersey seat vacated by another Democratic multi-millionaire, Frank Lautenberg, who had served three terms and was retiring at the age of 76. Mr Corzine spent at least $2m yesterday alone, including $75 a head on homeless people from nearby Philadelphia and recovering drug addicts employed to help get out the vote. The man defeated by Mr Corzine, Republican Bob Franks, had raised a relatively puny $6m and had to ride on the former presidential primary candidate John McCain's Straight Talk Express bus. The campaign behind Mr Franks, 49, spent about $1m on encouraging turnout yesterday when their man appeared to be doing better than expected in the opinion polls. But his hopes of winning were never going to be good after the Republicans decided to concentrate their resources on the ultimately failed campaign of Rick Lazio to prevent Hillary Clinton from winning a Senate seat from neighbouring New York. Mr Corzine, who, unlike Mrs Clinton, has lived in the state he now represents for 25 years, left Goldman Sachs last year with a fortune estimated at $400m and was making his first attempt to win office.",

Mr Gore led among those who thought the issues were most important while Mr Bush led among those who valued personal qualities.</p> <p>Both presidential candidates had strong support from their party bases and were splitting the independents about evenly, according to preliminary poll results.

Supporters of 1996 third-party candidate Ross Perot tilted toward Bush this time round.</p> <p>The most important issue for many voters was the economy, and those who picked that issue backed Mr Gore heavily. Taxes were another important issue and that group backed Mr Bush by an overwhelming margin.</p> <p>The Republican was also backed by those who thought that world affairs was the top issue, while the vice-president was backed by those who thought that healthcare and prescription drugs were important issues.</p> <p>Two-thirds of voters felt that President Clinton was at least partially responsible for the strong state of the American economy and those people leaned towards the Gore camp.</p> <p>Just under half of those questioned felt the president's scandals were important and they tilted heavily towards Mr Bush. Those who thought the scandals were very important backed Bush by six to one.</p> <p>Both candidates were seen by voters as being good for education, an issue that has traditionally favoured the Democrats.</p> <p>Voters who cared most about a candidate's honesty favoured Mr Bush and those who wanted a president with experience mostly sided with Mr Gore.</p> <p>About one in four said reports that Mr Bush had been arrested in 1976 for drunken driving was important to their vote. <br>AP</p>",

      "bodyText": "George W Bush got some strong backing from those voters who sought honesty and strong leadership in a candidate, exit polls said this morning, while Al Gore drew solid support from those who wanted experience and understanding of complex issues. The voters' split priorities reflected the tug-of-war between personality and experience that has been at the core of this campaign. Voters were interviewed last night and this morning as they left the polls by Voter News Service. Mr Gore led among women, blacks and Hispanics; Mr Bush among men and whites. Mr Bush led among parents; Mr Gore among non-parents, a larger group. The two candidates were matched fairly evenly among most age groups. The Democrat led among those who made $30,000 or less a year while the Republican led among those who made $75,000 or more. They were evenly divided among middle-income voters. Mr Gore led among those who thought the issues were most important while Mr Bush led among those who valued personal qualities. Both presidential candidates had strong support from their party bases and were splitting the independents about evenly, according to preliminary poll results. Mr Gore was getting four of five Clinton supporters from 1996 and Mr Bush was getting nine of 10 who voted for Bob Dole, the previous Republican candidate. Supporters of 1996 third-party candidate Ross Perot tilted toward Bush this time round. The most important issue for many voters was the economy, and those who picked that issue backed Mr Gore heavily. Taxes were another important issue and that group backed Mr Bush by an overwhelming margin. The Republican was also backed by those who thought that world affairs was the top issue, while the vice-president was backed by those who thought that healthcare and prescription drugs were important issues. Two-thirds of voters felt that President Clinton was at least partially responsible for the strong state of the American economy and those people leaned towards the Gore camp. Just under half of those questioned felt the president's scandals were important and they tilted heavily towards Mr Bush. Those who thought the scandals were very important backed Bush by six to one. Both candidates were seen by voters as being good for education, an issue that has traditionally favoured the Democrats. Voters who cared most about a candidate's honesty favoured Mr Bush and those who wanted a president with experience mostly sided with Mr Gore. About one in four said reports that Mr Bush had been arrested in 1976 for drunken driving was important to their vote. AP",

Kirsty Garven, a financial administration officer at Marks &amp; Spencer, from Chester, died in July after showing symptoms of vCJD for a year. The coroner at the inquest which looked into the deaths of three people from vCJD recorded a verdict of misadventure and said that the man and two women had died \"unnatural deaths.\" In the first inquest to be held since publication of the Phillips Report into the BSE crisis, Crewe coroner's court heard how Ms Garven, 20, Thomas Gemmel, 17, and Alison Thorpe, 25 - all residents of Cheshire - had died of the disease within two years of each other. The first victim was Alison Thorpe from Macclesfield, who began showing symptoms of vCJD in 1997 but was not properly diagnosed until months before her death. Doctors at Manchester Royal Infirmary believed she was suffering from anorexia. Her mother, Susan Hodge, eventually took her to see a specialist. She died at home in August, 1998. Thomas Gemmel, from Northwich, was wrongly diagnosed with growing pains in May 1998, when he was 15. \"He became very unstable and couldn't walk without two people holding him,\" his father, Robert Gemmel, told the inquest. The inquest heard how Thomas, who died in February, had enjoyed a balanced diet of meat and vegetables. But Kirsty Garven's mother said she was a \"devil for McDonald's\", and loved Campbell's meatballs more than anyone else in her family. The 20-year-old showed symptoms of vCJD for a year before she died, the inquest heard. The first signs appeared during a holiday in Gran Canaria last year. The coroner, Nicholas Rheinberg, said that all three had died \"unnatural deaths\" caused by vCJD from contaminated beef in the food chain. Mrs Hodge complained that lack of health authority care had left the family to deal with her daughter's illness on their own. Mr Rheinberg said the BSE enquiry had prompted the medical profession to implement a better system of care. Kirsty Garven's mother, Jennifer, said: \"We will never recover from this. Any family that has seen someone gradually deteriorate will never forget it.\"",

By the end of his life, he took such a view to be uncharacteristically conservative: \"We're not borrowing from our children, we're stealing from them - and it's not even considered to be a crime.\"</p> <p>Twice nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize, Brower founded Friends of the Earth, after being ejected from the Sierra Club, an organisation which had originally been set up for hikers in America but which, under his leadership, became a powerful environmental group.</p> <p>He kept dams out of the Grand Canyon; helped create the Redwood national park; pushed through the landmark Wilderness Act, which set aside millions of acres of US public land, establishing the concept of keeping the countryside pristine; and stopped oil and timber corporations having the run of Alaska. Throughout, he maintained his vision in the face of an American environmental movement increasingly drawn to the corridors of power through lobbying and politicking in Washington.</p> <p>Brower was born in Berkeley, California, when there were no bridges to obstruct the view through San Francisco Bay to the Pacific, and the surrounding hills were untouched. His father was an academic, but his mother went blind when her son was seven. Helping her see, he recalled, sharpened his own appreciation of the natural surroundings.</p> <p>After high school, he entered the University of California, Berkeley, in 1930 to study entomology, but left to become a mountaineer. He made 70 first ascents of the perpendicular granite rocks of Yosemite park, where he established 19 new routes, and scaled the 12,000ft-high mountains of California's Sierra Nevada. He was an instructor in the US 10th Mountain Division, and, during the second world war, served as a combat-intelligence officer in Italy, where he won the Bronze Medal.</p> <p>When Brower joined the Sierra Club in 1933, it was an elite institution with just 2,000 members. He was elected to the board in 1942, and on returning from war service, edited the club magazine. In 1952, he became executive director, and built the club into a political force, raising its membership to 77,000 by the 1960s, and pioneering the use of films and journalism to put across the ecological argument. During his regime, politicians stopped and listened when the Sierra Club took a position.</p> <p>But in 1963, Brower failed to save Glen Canyon, in his view \"the most beautiful place on earth, no exception\". It was a deep narrow ravine in the northern Arizona desert, with wondrously shaped rock walls, cascading waterfalls, bowers of ferns, quiet pools and Indian inscriptions. However, the club's board voted to support a compromise development plan, and it was dammed. Eventually, the rising waters of the river in the canyon's bottom obliterated its wonders for ever.</p> <p>Renowned for his almost mystical ability to return to the fray after defeat (John McPhee's 1990 book on him was entitled Encounters With The Archdruid), Brower was spurred on by this reverse to more intense opposition to the construction of several proposed dams in the Grand Canyon. In 1966, the Sierra Club took out huge advertisements in major American newspapers asking people to save the canyon from being flooded \"for profit\". The next day, the US Internal Revenue Service revoked the club's tax exemptions, available only if it kept out of political activities. But this insensitivity boomeranged in headlines across the country. Brower recalled: \"People who didn't know whether they loved the Grand Canyon sure knew whether or not they loved the IRS.\"</p> <p>When Floyd Dominy, the government official in charge of dam-building, declared that the canyon \"lakes\" (reservoirs) created by the dams would enable people to see the walls better from boats, Brower ran an ad saying: \"Should we also flood the Sistine Chapel so tourists can get nearer the ceiling?\" Within 12 months, he and his supporters had won.</p> <p>Yet only two years later, in 1969, Brower was out. The argument in the Sierra Club was ostensibly about a series of unsold coffee-table books he had commissioned as part of his strategy of showing off nature's wonders to encourage preservation. But central to the dispute was the club's accommodation of corporate interests, Brower having made enemies of members on immigration issues, and on notions, held by some, that came close to eugenics.</p> <p>The same year, Brower formed the more radical Friends of the Earth (FoE), which incorporated opposition to nuclear weapons as a green issue - something the Sierrra Club had declined to embrace. A motto he never needed to go back on was his \"think globally, act locally\", coined for FoE. But by 1984, the organisation was in debt and the staff were rebelling. In 1986, when the board tried to move their headquarters to Washington, Brower resigned and went to work with the San Francisco-based Earth Island Institute, which he had formed in 1982. It has had major achievements in preserving wildlife, such as sea turtles and dolphins.</p> <p>Last year, Brower withdrew at the last minute from the election to become president of the Sierra Club, and wrote a conciliatory letter about the need for unity. But he could not resist quoting Isaiah about the club and its corporate dealmakers: \"Thou hast multiplied the nation, but not increased the joy.\"</p> <p>It was the joy of an unspoilt world to which Brower devoted his long life. He leaves his wife, Anne, three sons and a daughter.</p> <p>\u0095 David Ross Brower, environmental campaigner, born July 1 1912; died November 5 2000</p>",

      "bodyText": "\"We do not inherit the earth from our fathers, we are borrowing it from our children,\" proclaims a chiselled stone at the National Aquarium in Washington, ascribing the words to David Brower, the father of the modern conservation movement and its greatest, incorruptible crusader, who has died aged 88. But it was typical of Brower's stormy trajectory that he later failed to recognise the sentiment as his own, putting down its appearance, in an interview, to being plied with a third Martini in a North Carolina bar by a journalist. By the end of his life, he took such a view to be uncharacteristically conservative: \"We're not borrowing from our children, we're stealing from them - and it's not even considered to be a crime.\" Twice nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize, Brower founded Friends of the Earth, after being ejected from the Sierra Club, an organisation which had originally been set up for hikers in America but which, under his leadership, became a powerful environmental group. He kept dams out of the Grand Canyon; helped create the Redwood national park; pushed through the landmark Wilderness Act, which set aside millions of acres of US public land, establishing the concept of keeping the countryside pristine; and stopped oil and timber corporations having the run of Alaska. Throughout, he maintained his vision in the face of an American environmental movement increasingly drawn to the corridors of power through lobbying and politicking in Washington. Brower was born in Berkeley, California, when there were no bridges to obstruct the view through San Francisco Bay to the Pacific, and the surrounding hills were untouched. His father was an academic, but his mother went blind when her son was seven. Helping her see, he recalled, sharpened his own appreciation of the natural surroundings. After high school, he entered the University of California, Berkeley, in 1930 to study entomology, but left to become a mountaineer. He made 70 first ascents of the perpendicular granite rocks of Yosemite park, where he established 19 new routes, and scaled the 12,000ft-high mountains of California's Sierra Nevada. He was an instructor in the US 10th Mountain Division, and, during the second world war, served as a combat-intelligence officer in Italy, where he won the Bronze Medal. When Brower joined the Sierra Club in 1933, it was an elite institution with just 2,000 members. He was elected to the board in 1942, and on returning from war service, edited the club magazine. In 1952, he became executive director, and built the club into a political force, raising its membership to 77,000 by the 1960s, and pioneering the use of films and journalism to put across the ecological argument. During his regime, politicians stopped and listened when the Sierra Club took a position. But in 1963, Brower failed to save Glen Canyon, in his view \"the most beautiful place on earth, no exception\". It was a deep narrow ravine in the northern Arizona desert, with wondrously shaped rock walls, cascading waterfalls, bowers of ferns, quiet pools and Indian inscriptions. However, the club's board voted to support a compromise development plan, and it was dammed. Eventually, the rising waters of the river in the canyon's bottom obliterated its wonders for ever. Renowned for his almost mystical ability to return to the fray after defeat (John McPhee's 1990 book on him was entitled Encounters With The Archdruid), Brower was spurred on by this reverse to more intense opposition to the construction of several proposed dams in the Grand Canyon. In 1966, the Sierra Club took out huge advertisements in major American newspapers asking people to save the canyon from being flooded \"for profit\". The next day, the US Internal Revenue Service revoked the club's tax exemptions, available only if it kept out of political activities. But this insensitivity boomeranged in headlines across the country. Brower recalled: \"People who didn't know whether they loved the Grand Canyon sure knew whether or not they loved the IRS.\" When Floyd Dominy, the government official in charge of dam-building, declared that the canyon \"lakes\" (reservoirs) created by the dams would enable people to see the walls better from boats, Brower ran an ad saying: \"Should we also flood the Sistine Chapel so tourists can get nearer the ceiling?\" Within 12 months, he and his supporters had won. Yet only two years later, in 1969, Brower was out. The argument in the Sierra Club was ostensibly about a series of unsold coffee-table books he had commissioned as part of his strategy of showing off nature's wonders to encourage preservation. But central to the dispute was the club's accommodation of corporate interests, Brower having made enemies of members on immigration issues, and on notions, held by some, that came close to eugenics. The same year, Brower formed the more radical Friends of the Earth (FoE), which incorporated opposition to nuclear weapons as a green issue - something the Sierrra Club had declined to embrace. A motto he never needed to go back on was his \"think globally, act locally\", coined for FoE. But by 1984, the organisation was in debt and the staff were rebelling. In 1986, when the board tried to move their headquarters to Washington, Brower resigned and went to work with the San Francisco-based Earth Island Institute, which he had formed in 1982. It has had major achievements in preserving wildlife, such as sea turtles and dolphins. Last year, Brower withdrew at the last minute from the election to become president of the Sierra Club, and wrote a conciliatory letter about the need for unity. But he could not resist quoting Isaiah about the club and its corporate dealmakers: \"Thou hast multiplied the nation, but not increased the joy.\" It was the joy of an unspoilt world to which Brower devoted his long life. He leaves his wife, Anne, three sons and a daughter. \u0095 David Ross Brower, environmental campaigner, born July 1 1912; died November 5 2000",

      "body": "<p>Rangers' heart-breaking exit from the Champions League this year can be attributed to various causes.</p> <p>The club have suffered a horrendous injury crisis which, at times, has left manager Dick Advocaat with up to nine first-team players unavailable for selection at one time. Then there has been the rumoured unrest at Ibrox that led to Lorenzo Amoruso being stripped of the captaincy, followed swiftly by Advocaat's denial that the decision was forced on him by his own players.</p> <p>And, of course, you can't account for the kind of howlers that Amoroso committed to provide Marco Simone with the equaliser last night. </p> <p>Advocaat said after the game that he \"needed a bit of luck\" and then described his side's relegation to Uefa's second-string competition as \"understandable\", considering the tribulations that this season has brought.</p> <p>What Gers supporters are finding less understandable is their feelings of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu when the Champions League group stages are concluded each season. The club's greatest achievement in Europe is still the Cup Winners' Cup final victory over Dynamo Moscow in 1972. The Ibrox faithful are now in their 28th year of hurt and stories of injury crises, bad luck and \"losing to the better side on the night\" must be wearing a thin.</p> <p>Advocaat brought an air of expectation to the club when he took over from Walter Smith in 1998. It wasn't that Smith was unpopular at Rangers - far from it - but many fans believed he lacked the tactical acumen to succeed in Europe.

      "bodyText": "Rangers' heart-breaking exit from the Champions League this year can be attributed to various causes. The club have suffered a horrendous injury crisis which, at times, has left manager Dick Advocaat with up to nine first-team players unavailable for selection at one time. Then there has been the rumoured unrest at Ibrox that led to Lorenzo Amoruso being stripped of the captaincy, followed swiftly by Advocaat's denial that the decision was forced on him by his own players. And, of course, you can't account for the kind of howlers that Amoroso committed to provide Marco Simone with the equaliser last night. Advocaat said after the game that he \"needed a bit of luck\" and then described his side's relegation to Uefa's second-string competition as \"understandable\", considering the tribulations that this season has brought. What Gers supporters are finding less understandable is their feelings of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu when the Champions League group stages are concluded each season. The club's greatest achievement in Europe is still the Cup Winners' Cup final victory over Dynamo Moscow in 1972. The Ibrox faithful are now in their 28th year of hurt and stories of injury crises, bad luck and \"losing to the better side on the night\" must be wearing a thin. Advocaat brought an air of expectation to the club when he took over from Walter Smith in 1998. It wasn't that Smith was unpopular at Rangers - far from it - but many fans believed he lacked the tactical acumen to succeed in Europe. Advocaat's years at PSV Eindhoven, Twente Enschede and as Holland coach, supporters believed, had primed him for a European conquest. But Advocaat seems to have lost his way at Glasgow. His decision-making is becoming increasingly erratic as the club has suffered setbacks in both domestic and European competitions. Last night he left Tugay Kerimoglu out of the starting eleven, a player who has had a calming influence over the Rangers' midfield in recent weeks. His gamble on Michael Mols appeared justified when the Dutchman scored but, as expected, he did not last the distance and Tugay replaced him after 55 minutes. So Dick has not been so clever recently. But blaming him, or sacking him is not the long-term solution to the club's problem. Glasgow's footballing powerhouses - Rangers and Celtic - joining another league as soon as possible, however, is. In August, David Murray said he was fully behind a proposed Atlantic League, which would involve Rangers and Celtic joining sides from Portugal, Holland, Belgium and Scandanavia in a Uefa-sanctioned alternative to domestic competitions. The hope was to start such a competition in 2003, but that is looking increasingly unlikely as other European sides have delayed backing the project. They are not in as serious a situation as Rangers. By simply substituting their league and FA Cup for this Atlantic League will not be enough. They need to play in a regular league against top quality sides. The argument still exists for a British league. Last weekend's fixtures in the English and Scottish leagues prove the point. Rangers prepared for last night's game against Monaco, who have a strong European pedigree, by hammering St Mirren, who do not, 7-1 in the Scottish Premier League. The result was a welcome one for the Blues, and particularly for Kenny Miller who scored five, but the game was a world away from the challenge they faced last night. Leeds United, on the other hand, faced Liverpool at the weekend ahead of tonight's clash with AC Milan. Regardless of the drama of the game itself, the fact is that Liverpool, despite their own struggles at the very top level in recent seasons, remain a far more intimidating opposition than St Mirren. As players have been telling us for quite a few seasons now, there are no easy games in the Premiership. David O'Leary, a strong believer in that philosophy, can sympathise with Advocaat's injury-list tales of woe. Should Leeds get knocked out of the Champions League tonight, he is likely to conclude, as Advocaat did, that such a result is \"understandable\". Yet Leeds' performances in their first Champions League season have impressed more than the Scottish side's, chiefly because of the resolve they have displayed against unquestionably superior sides such as Milan and Barcelona, particularly with most of the first team resting up in the treatment room. This can be attributed to their rigorous Premiership schedule. While many still argue that the demands of the league can fatigue players and indeed be the cause of injury lists such as O'Leary's, those that do play are regularly involved in matches that require immense stamina, both mental and physical.

      "body": "<p>Beware of shroud wavers. Be doubly wary when the issue involved is the highly controversial - and complex - issue of drug control. Yesterday, the drug tsar became an overt politician. Drawing himself up to his full former chief constable's height, Keith Hellawell told a press conference assembled for his second annual report that he was now convinced that cannabis was \"a gateway drug\". He said he had always been reluctant to use the term. But he was now convinced by a new study of drug-taking habits in New Zealand. It concluded, he claimed, that young people who smoked a joint once a week were 60 times more likely to progress to harder drugs. He went on: \"The pro-legalisers who have said that cannabis isn't a gateway drug will have to look at this hard and long.\"</p> <p>To be fair to the tsar, the new study is not one of those snapshot surveys showing that a large majority of hard drug users had earlier used cannabis. These prove nothing, but are regularly misin terpreted by commentators who fail to draw a distinction between an association and a causal relation. Such surveys cannot prove causality. They ignore the huge proportion of cannabis users who never take up hard drugs. The new study is \"longitudinal\" in the jargon, following young people from birth to the age of 21. It has been carried out by well-respected social scientists. It is full of caveats as well as extremely esoteric statistical analysis. It does not state what the tsar implied: that if you use cannabis you will invariably progress to regular addictive hard drugs. It emphasises \"harder\" not \"hard\" drugs. The long list includes prescription drugs and magic mushrooms. Hard drugs, including heroin and cocaine, accounted for mere 4%. Even then, it was not suggesting this was an addictive move, but merely an initial taste. Mo Mowlam, the drugs minister, was right to be more sceptical. But then she, unlike the tsar, is a social scientist and more ready to resist Tony Blair's hard line.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Beware of shroud wavers. Be doubly wary when the issue involved is the highly controversial - and complex - issue of drug control. Yesterday, the drug tsar became an overt politician. Drawing himself up to his full former chief constable's height, Keith Hellawell told a press conference assembled for his second annual report that he was now convinced that cannabis was \"a gateway drug\". He said he had always been reluctant to use the term. But he was now convinced by a new study of drug-taking habits in New Zealand. It concluded, he claimed, that young people who smoked a joint once a week were 60 times more likely to progress to harder drugs. He went on: \"The pro-legalisers who have said that cannabis isn't a gateway drug will have to look at this hard and long.\" To be fair to the tsar, the new study is not one of those snapshot surveys showing that a large majority of hard drug users had earlier used cannabis. These prove nothing, but are regularly misin terpreted by commentators who fail to draw a distinction between an association and a causal relation. Such surveys cannot prove causality. They ignore the huge proportion of cannabis users who never take up hard drugs. The new study is \"longitudinal\" in the jargon, following young people from birth to the age of 21. It has been carried out by well-respected social scientists. It is full of caveats as well as extremely esoteric statistical analysis. It does not state what the tsar implied: that if you use cannabis you will invariably progress to regular addictive hard drugs. It emphasises \"harder\" not \"hard\" drugs. The long list includes prescription drugs and magic mushrooms. Hard drugs, including heroin and cocaine, accounted for mere 4%. Even then, it was not suggesting this was an addictive move, but merely an initial taste. Mo Mowlam, the drugs minister, was right to be more sceptical. But then she, unlike the tsar, is a social scientist and more ready to resist Tony Blair's hard line.",

Put him on a banknote. The Bank of England has done just that. He is to adorn the new forgery-proof \u00a310 note. Forgery-proof? Maybe not totally, but it comes with all manner of holograms to make life tricky for counterfeiters. Who has Darwin replaced? Charles Dickens. Wasn't he another bloke with a beard? Wispier. The Bank of England seems rather keen on blokes with beards. They resent that slur. \"You do not have to be a hirsute male to appear on a banknote,\" says a spokeswoman. \"Is the Queen a hirsute male?\" So apart from reigning monarchs, who does get to appear on banknotes? Brits who have made a \"lifetime's contribution\" to the arts or sciences. Why did Dickens get the chop? Balance. The composer Edward Elgar replaced electrical engineer Michael Faraday on the \u00a320 note last year, and the science lobby had to be placated. Hard times for writers? They're all of a twist. So what did Darwin do to get on a tenner? A feckless medical student and trainee vicar, he was shipped off at 22 on a five-year voyage to South America on board the Beagle. There he discovered his vocation as scientist and, eureka, the theory of evolution by natural selection. Wrote Origin of Species and The Descent of Man, exploding creationism and producing the Victorian crisis of faith. That (plus the beard) is enough to get him on a banknote? Well, he has a greater claim than Sir John Houblon, who graces the \u00a350. Sir John is . . . ? A banker. And who gets to choose the note-ables? The ruling court of the Bank of England. What a lot of bankers. Quite.",

      "body": "<p>It's typical of the enterprise of the Guildhall School's opera department that its latest production, a triple bill, should include a British premiere and a work that has rarely, if ever, been seen on stage before. </p> <p>Debussy's \"lyric scene\" L'Enfant Prodigue - a fascinating score that reveals both where his music came from and where it was heading - wasn't intended for the opera house at all: it was the piece that won the composer the Prix de Rome in 1884, while he was studying with Massenet. Here though it is staged, with a good deal of conviction, alongside two of his teacher's one-acters. </p> <p>Massenet's Le Portrait de Manon was designed in 1894 as a sequel to his most famous opera, and has never been seen in Britain before. The plot is thin and contrived: the now mature Des Grieux continues to hark back remorsefully to his affair with Manon, and the tragedy of her death, until he manages to exorcise her memory thanks to his nephew Jean and the woman he wants to marry, Aurore, who reminds Des Grieux inescapably of Manon. If it's an excuse for a trawl through some of the famous themes of the earlier opera, it does so pleasantly and undemandingly enough. </p> <p>La Navarraise, though, could hardly be more different. It was Massenet's shot at doing verismo, composed in 1901 in the wake of the success of Mascagni's Cavalleria Rusticana, and he shows that he can do it just as lustily and loudly as any of his Italian contemporaries. </p> <p>The story is set in a Basque village on the frontline of the Carlist war in Spain in the 1870s; there is plenty of military action, some lively local colour and a strong central love interest in the romance between Anita, the girl from Navarre of the title, and Araquil, a sergeant in the Royalist forces - hot-blooded, and surreptitiously enjoyable stuff. </p> <p>Stephen Langridge's Guildhall production (in Jessica Curtis's sets and conducted by Clive Timms) sensibly treats each work on its own merits, so that the Debussy is given an almost ritualised Middle-Eastern setting, while Le Portrait de Manon is presented naturalistically and La Navarraise in a suitably noisy and robust way. There are fine performances in all three, especially from Natasha Jouhl as the mother Lia in L'Enfant Prodigue, and from the sturdy tenor Andrew Rees and the gleaming-toned soprano Gweneth-Ann Jeffers, as the central pair of lovers in La Navarraise. </p> <p> Further performances tonight and Friday. Box office: 020-7628 2571.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It's typical of the enterprise of the Guildhall School's opera department that its latest production, a triple bill, should include a British premiere and a work that has rarely, if ever, been seen on stage before. Debussy's \"lyric scene\" L'Enfant Prodigue - a fascinating score that reveals both where his music came from and where it was heading - wasn't intended for the opera house at all: it was the piece that won the composer the Prix de Rome in 1884, while he was studying with Massenet. Here though it is staged, with a good deal of conviction, alongside two of his teacher's one-acters. Massenet's Le Portrait de Manon was designed in 1894 as a sequel to his most famous opera, and has never been seen in Britain before. The plot is thin and contrived: the now mature Des Grieux continues to hark back remorsefully to his affair with Manon, and the tragedy of her death, until he manages to exorcise her memory thanks to his nephew Jean and the woman he wants to marry, Aurore, who reminds Des Grieux inescapably of Manon. If it's an excuse for a trawl through some of the famous themes of the earlier opera, it does so pleasantly and undemandingly enough. La Navarraise, though, could hardly be more different. It was Massenet's shot at doing verismo, composed in 1901 in the wake of the success of Mascagni's Cavalleria Rusticana, and he shows that he can do it just as lustily and loudly as any of his Italian contemporaries. The story is set in a Basque village on the frontline of the Carlist war in Spain in the 1870s; there is plenty of military action, some lively local colour and a strong central love interest in the romance between Anita, the girl from Navarre of the title, and Araquil, a sergeant in the Royalist forces - hot-blooded, and surreptitiously enjoyable stuff. Stephen Langridge's Guildhall production (in Jessica Curtis's sets and conducted by Clive Timms) sensibly treats each work on its own merits, so that the Debussy is given an almost ritualised Middle-Eastern setting, while Le Portrait de Manon is presented naturalistically and La Navarraise in a suitably noisy and robust way. There are fine performances in all three, especially from Natasha Jouhl as the mother Lia in L'Enfant Prodigue, and from the sturdy tenor Andrew Rees and the gleaming-toned soprano Gweneth-Ann Jeffers, as the central pair of lovers in La Navarraise. Further performances tonight and Friday. Box office: 020-7628 2571.",

      "body": "<p>Anyone who has ever read or watched The Firm - or indeed any other John Grisham blockbuster - will know only too well that top American law firms routinely offer their fresh, straight-out-of-law-school new recruits company BMWs, stratospheric bonuses and fat-cat salaries. Alas, anyone who has ever read John Grisham thoroughly will also know that such absurdly glittering packages come with a high price tag: often the ritual sacrifice of one's evenings, morals, personal relationships and blood pressure. </p> <p>We may like to think it couldn't happen here - not on the same scale, anyway - but now it has. Last week came the news that two of London's top law firms are to offer their newly-qualified recruits a starting salary of \u00a342,000 - probably enough to make many feel decidedly nauseous. It certainly isn't bad for a first pay cheque - and in fact Allen &amp; Overy and Linklaters, the two solicitors' firms in question, know only too well that even this sum might not be enough to lure the most talented new legal brains to their doors. </p> <p>Increasingly, salaries of \u00a350,000, even \u00a360,000 and above are needed: not bad for a new recruit with little experience of law beyond the correct use of Tipp-Ex and how to carry a box of files from one office to another. Hyperinflation is the order of the day: graduate salaries have been rising at the rate of 30% for the past three years. The reason: stiff competition from aggressive American firms such as Dewey Ballantine and Sullivan &amp; Cromwell. </p> <p>Take Adam Ross, a freshly-minted lawyer with a US company based in London, who earns, as he puts it, \"in excess of 50k, plus bonus\". He says: \"I must admit, the money was a big factor in my choosing to go with an American firm. One minute I was scrabbling around as a trainee with student loans to pay off and growing credit card debts. Overnight, I've been able to go out and buy a home cinema system, an MP3 mini-jukebox and I'm looking at buying an Audi. This may sound shallow, but having money for the first time does make me feel good about myself, and I can't see that ever wearing off.\" </p> <p>But does he enjoy the work? \"To be honest, a lot of it is just drudge work and, yes, the hours and the personalities in my office can both be tough. It's tempting to go and get completely trashed after work. Among my peers, drugs are usual, too. When I watched This Life, I thought all that stuff with the lines of coke was an exaggeration. But it's really not.\" </p> <p>Sadly for the envious and less well- paid, money really can buy happiness, says Professor Andrew Oswald, a psychologist at Warwick University who has studied the links between bank balances and emotions. \"There's no question. In my studies across Europe, money does appear to make people happier,\" he says. But that is only half the story. \"In the workplace, money is a more complex issue. Merely being well-paid does not guarantee happiness. Long commutes, difficult bosses and overcrowded offices cancel out the effect of financial incentives . . . The happiest group of all workers, regardless of salary, are the self-employed.\" </p> <p>The ratcheting up of competition for new graduates means top firms are driven to greater and greater lengths to woo their prey. James Norton-Jones, currently being sponsored through his law conversion degree by City firm Herbert Smith, says the situation at Oxford has become absurd. \"There's such one-upmanship among firms - not just law firms but merchant banks and IT firms, too - to host the most lavish receptions. The Randolph Hotel used to be the top spot; now that seems dull. Cocktails at Freuds is seen as the most desirable place now. I was rung up out of the blue by a bank asking if I'd be interested in a job. Never in my life had I expressed an interest in banking - they targeted me because I was captain of the college boat club. If you run anything at all, they want to see you.\" </p> <p>But they had started on Norton-Jones long before Oxford. \"I first made contact with Herbert Smith when they came to our school [Winchester]. I always knew I was going to be a lawyer but I wanted to go with a firm that offered a decent starting package. They are also paying my fees and giving me \u00a35,000 living allowance.\" </p> <p>Many of the highest paid new graduates certainly work for their salaries. And being paid so well, Adam Ross says, imposes an added burden. \"It's about supply and demand - that's why we're being paid funny money. They know they have to do that to get us. But my God, we do earn it. I don't mind - there's plenty of time to party later.\" </p> <p>Law firms are unwilling to comment on their salary policies, but the hyperinflation shows no signs of slowing. \"There is currently a big shortage of lawyers,\" says Gill Jones of legal recruitment consultants Taylor Root, who monitor salaries in the profession. \"Firms have become more mobile, which means they are losing staff to the US, Europe and Asia. And during the last recession, loads of people were made redundant, so we're still trying to catch up with the shortfall. The salary levels might seem high, but I think pound per pound, lawyers work much harder than merchant bankers or management consultants. There's no guarantee that they will eventually make it to being a partner, and the stress in these City law firms is phenomenal.\" </p> <p>Generous pay packets are used to justify a climate in which \"people going into law are expected to put their lives on hold,\" Jones says. \"Many firms are short-staffed. You are expected to work round-the-clock, evenings and weekends, and, although firms are now being forced to be more supportive of new recruits, if you get put in with an arrogant, difficult boss, your life can be made a misery. I frequently see young people cracking up under the stress.\" </p> <p>It may take an effort to summon much sympathy for the \u00a360k brigade - but a Law Society study last week supports Jones's argument, showing that one in five trainee solicitors claims to have been bullied. </p> <p> It's not just law. Absurdly high starting pay has long been the norm in information technology, management consultancy and banking. Andersen Consulting recently announced a package of \u00a310,000 \"golden hellos\", on top of more than adequate salaries, to attract new staff. </p> <p>Richard Halkett was lured into a management training programme by Lloyds-TSB. \"They rang me while I was still a student, I think because I was president of my college,\" he says. His starting salary was in the high 20s - nothing in comparison with those offered by many law firms, but still far above average for the sector, and it was supplemented by a four-figure, interest-free loan. </p> <p>But Halkett soon found that, despite the luxury of going from student loan to decent pay cheque, he wasn't happy. \"It wasn't for me. I couldn't get my head around having to achieve things in the nine-to-five time frame when I'd been used to writing essays when I felt like it,\" he says. \"After six months I left and am now running a dot.com start-up for academics.\" He has seen many of his contemporaries seduced by fat starter salaries and thinks many of them are making a big mistake. \"When you leave university, your needs aren't that great. You don't have expensive tastes, you usually don't have dependants, why do you need all that money? There's plenty of time to do that later.\" </p> <p>In any case, can any newly-qualified recruit really be worth \u00a3100,000, or even \u00a350,000? \"No, of course not,\" Gill Jones says, with refreshing candour. \"But the market dictates these levels and that's where we're at at the moment. If you're looking at law, the hours these people work are horrendous. If you totalled up the hours put in by someone who's earning under \u00a370,000, maybe qualified for three years, you'd find they weren't earning significantly more than their PA.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>One-man bands are normally associated with bygone eras or buskers - the ability to play guitar while clattering cymbals attached to your knees is a little-appreciated art form - but no one has told Petit Vodo. So with an harmonica wrapped around his neck, guitar under one arm, drumsticks in both hands, he's merrily creating havoc with tradition. </p> <p>Vodo, a guise adopted by Bordeaux native Sebastien Chevalier, has the soul of a Delta blues man and the dexterity of a 20-strong brass band. So it's surprising that the diminutive figure lugging instruments on stage is the genius in question. Slight doesn't describe the 5ft nothing musician, whose only concession to making the transition from roadie to star is to don orange-tinted glasses and a hat with flaps. </p> <p>\"I am French,\" he proclaims, a sample of a moaning woman set to cut-beats and backward loops behind him. \"I wanna play my blues, I wanna play my rock'n'roll.\" And rock he does. Vodo obviously has a penchant for Bo Diddley and he's just as enamoured with Jon Spencer - his loudspeaker-sounding vocals and screams of pent-up delight the most obvious affectations - and the Kinks. </p> <p>Big Like That sees him at his most versatile, playing heavy guitar riffs with one hand, keeping the beat going with drum and cymbal combo with the other. Then there's the harmonica, evoking the power of Bob Dylan, fired by a passion of his own as his left leg frantically keeps time. </p> <p>After releasing the album 69 Stereo Vox, his capacity to astonish and entertain has just seen him complete a five-date tour of Britain and tonight he works through any remaining demons. It's an exhilarating, if tiring, ride - the intensely controlled performance outweighing the showmanship. </p> <p>Originally a drummer who combines Beck tendencies with lecturing in art, Vodo appears to be indulging in an avant-garde musical statement, while still playing a good tune. Drumming on the microphones surrounding him, using a drumstick to play slide guitar and masterfully tapping and blowing into a steel kettle, he's a man possessed. </p> <p>The kettle is integral to Spam Cow, a lo-fi epic as discordant trumpet meets looped humming sounds, Vodo coiling himself around an old-fashioned microphone, standing on a speaker to reach it. He cackles and yells demonically, his voice throaty and sleazy. We're left not just admiring the talent but caught up in his vision. </p>",

      "bodyText": "One-man bands are normally associated with bygone eras or buskers - the ability to play guitar while clattering cymbals attached to your knees is a little-appreciated art form - but no one has told Petit Vodo. So with an harmonica wrapped around his neck, guitar under one arm, drumsticks in both hands, he's merrily creating havoc with tradition. Vodo, a guise adopted by Bordeaux native Sebastien Chevalier, has the soul of a Delta blues man and the dexterity of a 20-strong brass band. So it's surprising that the diminutive figure lugging instruments on stage is the genius in question. Slight doesn't describe the 5ft nothing musician, whose only concession to making the transition from roadie to star is to don orange-tinted glasses and a hat with flaps. \"I am French,\" he proclaims, a sample of a moaning woman set to cut-beats and backward loops behind him. \"I wanna play my blues, I wanna play my rock'n'roll.\" And rock he does. Vodo obviously has a penchant for Bo Diddley and he's just as enamoured with Jon Spencer - his loudspeaker-sounding vocals and screams of pent-up delight the most obvious affectations - and the Kinks. Big Like That sees him at his most versatile, playing heavy guitar riffs with one hand, keeping the beat going with drum and cymbal combo with the other. Then there's the harmonica, evoking the power of Bob Dylan, fired by a passion of his own as his left leg frantically keeps time. After releasing the album 69 Stereo Vox, his capacity to astonish and entertain has just seen him complete a five-date tour of Britain and tonight he works through any remaining demons. It's an exhilarating, if tiring, ride - the intensely controlled performance outweighing the showmanship. Originally a drummer who combines Beck tendencies with lecturing in art, Vodo appears to be indulging in an avant-garde musical statement, while still playing a good tune. Drumming on the microphones surrounding him, using a drumstick to play slide guitar and masterfully tapping and blowing into a steel kettle, he's a man possessed. The kettle is integral to Spam Cow, a lo-fi epic as discordant trumpet meets looped humming sounds, Vodo coiling himself around an old-fashioned microphone, standing on a speaker to reach it. He cackles and yells demonically, his voice throaty and sleazy. We're left not just admiring the talent but caught up in his vision.",

Rejecting calls from exporters for specific measures to reduce the value of the pound, Sir Eddie said that the economy was running at almost full capacity and a further tightening in monetary policy could not be ruled out. He added that inflation would start to rise unless there was a slowdown in the rate of private sector demand growth to prevent a further deteriora tion in the trade balance and accommodate \"the public sector expenditure growth which the chancellor has already announced, not to mention whatever he may be planning to announce tomorrow\". Speaking to the CBI annual conference in Birmingham, Sir Eddie said: \"There are signs that this slowdown in private sector demand growth may be beginning to happen, but that is certainly not assured - and over-generous tax cuts would not help. \"I must tell you that I am surprised by the billions of pounds that some commentators have suggested the chancellor could safely give away.\" Sir Eddie said Britain's long period of economic expansion could continue provided there was low and stable inflation, fiscal prudence and supply-side flexibility. However, he added that he was aware that many business leaders - struggling with the impact of the strong pound - would conclude that he was \"living on a different planet\". Beneath the surface of the encouraging macroeconomic data, there was a serious imbalance between those parts of Britain doing very well - including services and hi-tech manufacturing - and those parts facing the toughest conditions that they could remember. He said globalisation was one reason for the disparity between sectors, but added that the strength of the pound had also been a key factor. \"There is no doubt that some of these effects have been aggravated by exaggerated changes in foreign exchange rates - including the progressive weakening of the euro,\" he said. \"That is a particular problem for the UK because of the relatively large proportion of our economy exposed to competition from the eurozone. \"Even as a central banker I can understand why many euro-exposed businesses feel hard done by.\"",

Like Mali or Madagascar before it, the Republic of Tuva has suddenly become famous because of its music, and this bizarre double bill showed how the ancient and eerie art of Tuvan \"throat singing\" has collided with western pop and the avant garde to remarkable effect. </p> <p>First off, and by far the best, were the latest line-up of the Tuvan rock band, Yat-Kha. Now a five-piece with a girl singer included in their line-up, these unexpected heroes of last year's Womad festival showed how they have survived a year in which they have been feted by world music audiences and signed to Paddy Moloney's now sadly defunct Wicklow Records. </p> <p>They have got better, playing their updated treatment of local songs about \"horses and girls\" with passion, obvious enjoyment and a sense of danger, easing from patches of controlled discord to bursts of wild guitar work to show their sense of dynamics, and then bringing in traditional instruments that looked like early cellos and had names like the igil and doshpular. </p> <p>They looked like a throw-back to the psychedelic 1960s, with their long hair and velvet shirts, and sounded like nothing on earth, with the two male singers switching from almost-conventional sounds to impossibly low growls and what sounded like weird industrial buzzing effects. </p> <p>Yat-Kha are strange, but strangely accessible. Some of the songs had unexpected echoes of Celtic dance tunes, then veered off to eastern, at times almost Chinese-sounding, influences. The band speak little English but their leader, Albert Kuvezin, has developed a fine sense of dry humour. \"They call this Tuvan throat singing, but I've never heard a human sing without using their throats - ha!\" he announced. He finished a song about a Tuvan cowboy fooled by a girl from the frozen north (she beats his horse by riding a reindeer across the ice) with a question to the audience: \"Can you ride? I can hear that you can't. Ha!\" </p> <p>They were an impossible act to follow, as headliner Sainkho Namtchylak was to discover. She's been working outside Tuva for a while, in Russia and then the west, collaborating with the likes of Evan Parker and building a reputation on the experimental jazz circuit. Now, with Tuvan music in fashion, she seems to have lost direction. She came on with shaved head, white face and flowing white dress and acted out the songs by wandering around the stage, often with her head in her hands. She, too, had an extraordinary voice but her material sounded strangely dated. </p> <p>Partly this was the fault of her backing band, with acoustic guitars, double-bass and Tuvan traditional instruments, dominated by an infuriating sound-effects man who added anything from bird-song to pre-recorded rhythm tracks. There was a sub-Tom Waits clanking blues that almost worked, as did a couple of gentle ballads, but she was trying too hard to shock. Yat-Kha had already done that, with exuberance and charm. </p> <p> Yat-Kha and Sainkho Namtchylak play the Sir Jack Lyons Concert Hall, University of York (01904 432439), tonight, then tour. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Way out on the borders of Siberia and Western Mongolia there's an area of mountains, steppes, reindeer, horses and singers who make the most extraordinary noises on the planet. Like Mali or Madagascar before it, the Republic of Tuva has suddenly become famous because of its music, and this bizarre double bill showed how the ancient and eerie art of Tuvan \"throat singing\" has collided with western pop and the avant garde to remarkable effect. First off, and by far the best, were the latest line-up of the Tuvan rock band, Yat-Kha. Now a five-piece with a girl singer included in their line-up, these unexpected heroes of last year's Womad festival showed how they have survived a year in which they have been feted by world music audiences and signed to Paddy Moloney's now sadly defunct Wicklow Records. They have got better, playing their updated treatment of local songs about \"horses and girls\" with passion, obvious enjoyment and a sense of danger, easing from patches of controlled discord to bursts of wild guitar work to show their sense of dynamics, and then bringing in traditional instruments that looked like early cellos and had names like the igil and doshpular. They looked like a throw-back to the psychedelic 1960s, with their long hair and velvet shirts, and sounded like nothing on earth, with the two male singers switching from almost-conventional sounds to impossibly low growls and what sounded like weird industrial buzzing effects. Yat-Kha are strange, but strangely accessible. Some of the songs had unexpected echoes of Celtic dance tunes, then veered off to eastern, at times almost Chinese-sounding, influences. The band speak little English but their leader, Albert Kuvezin, has developed a fine sense of dry humour. \"They call this Tuvan throat singing, but I've never heard a human sing without using their throats - ha!\" he announced. He finished a song about a Tuvan cowboy fooled by a girl from the frozen north (she beats his horse by riding a reindeer across the ice) with a question to the audience: \"Can you ride? I can hear that you can't. Ha!\" They were an impossible act to follow, as headliner Sainkho Namtchylak was to discover. She's been working outside Tuva for a while, in Russia and then the west, collaborating with the likes of Evan Parker and building a reputation on the experimental jazz circuit. Now, with Tuvan music in fashion, she seems to have lost direction. She came on with shaved head, white face and flowing white dress and acted out the songs by wandering around the stage, often with her head in her hands. She, too, had an extraordinary voice but her material sounded strangely dated. Partly this was the fault of her backing band, with acoustic guitars, double-bass and Tuvan traditional instruments, dominated by an infuriating sound-effects man who added anything from bird-song to pre-recorded rhythm tracks. There was a sub-Tom Waits clanking blues that almost worked, as did a couple of gentle ballads, but she was trying too hard to shock. Yat-Kha had already done that, with exuberance and charm. Yat-Kha and Sainkho Namtchylak play the Sir Jack Lyons Concert Hall, University of York (01904 432439), tonight, then tour.",
