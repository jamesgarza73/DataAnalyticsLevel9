      "body": "<p>With what was arguably their only faultless performance in this triangular one-day series, England went through to Saturday's final at the Wanderers, where they will play South Africa. </p> <p>Yesterday's final round-robin match, against Zimbabwe, was abandoned without a ball being bowled. This left England and Zimbabwe level on four points and because they had beaten each other in their two previous matches, net run-rate decided the issue; England's was better by 0.15 of a run, 0.03 against Zimbabwe's minus 0.12. </p> <p>To say England blazed their way to the final, therefore, might be overstating matters. Squeegeed their way there, more like, having won only two of their six scheduled matches. </p> <p>Yet in the context of captain Nasser Hussain's eve-of-match, Henry V-like rallying cry the England players did everything that was asked of them. There were no wides, no no-balls and no silly batting collapses. They were utterly focused. </p> <p>In short, England played a blinder. While the Zimbabwe players frolicked and gambolled on the outfield, like children in a summer's meadow, in an effort to get play under way, the England boys glowered miserably in the bunker of their dressing room. </p> <p>The last thing they wanted to do was go out of this competition by losing some 25-over regatta. They had failed to qualify for the Super Six stage of the World Cup because they had forgotten about the importance of their run-rate. And to be fair to them this was a factor they had in mind during their one-sided victories over South Africa in Bloemfontein and Zimbabwe in Kimberley. </p> <p>Hussain said last night: \"It is not often you can accuse me of throwing my wicket away, but that is what I have done in this series in order to get our run-rate up to where it is. We can't be criticised because it has rained for three days. </p> <p>\"Today, at the end, the umpire Cyril Mitchley called us together and said he didn't think it was fit. He said that if both teams really wanted to play they could put down mats and sawdust and stuff. </p> <p>\"Andy Flower obviously wanted to play. I thought it would be a bit of a farce and I didn't want to play. Nobody wants to go through like that. </p> <p>\"I still think that if we had played as we can, we would have beaten Zimbabwe here today even in a short game, and it would have been nice to take some confidence and form into the final. Now we feel very keen to get out of the hotel and actually do something.\" </p> <p>Flower saw it differently. \"I feel very disappointed. We were very hyped up for this game. We can't do anything about the weather, but I thought the conditions were okay to play from about 6.30. </p> <p>\"I think cricketers are a little precious some of the time. I think cricketers should be a bit tougher and play in conditions that aren't perfect. Having said that, I don't blame Nasser for taking the stance he did and in the same situation we would have had the same attitude. I just feel there should be more leeway when conditions are not quite perfect. We cricketers tip-toe around a little too much.\" </p> <p>The rain did stop falling before the scheduled 2.30pm start, but the downpour had taken its toll. This is the third time in two tours that England's matches at this ground have been hit by the weather: the recent Test was reduced to 1 days' play, and the match here four years ago was also hit. Curiously, no other touring team has had weather problems at Centurion. </p> <p>\"We talked to both captains,\" Mitchley explained. \"Having said that, it was down to the umpires and we felt that conditions were not fit. The pitch was okay and so were the run-ups. But there were damp areas on the edge of the square and the shorter the game the more of a circus it can become.\"</p>",

To say England blazed their way to the final, therefore, might be overstating matters. Squeegeed their way there, more like, having won only two of their six scheduled matches. Yet in the context of captain Nasser Hussain's eve-of-match, Henry V-like rallying cry the England players did everything that was asked of them. There were no wides, no no-balls and no silly batting collapses. They were utterly focused. In short, England played a blinder. While the Zimbabwe players frolicked and gambolled on the outfield, like children in a summer's meadow, in an effort to get play under way, the England boys glowered miserably in the bunker of their dressing room. The last thing they wanted to do was go out of this competition by losing some 25-over regatta. They had failed to qualify for the Super Six stage of the World Cup because they had forgotten about the importance of their run-rate. And to be fair to them this was a factor they had in mind during their one-sided victories over South Africa in Bloemfontein and Zimbabwe in Kimberley. Hussain said last night: \"It is not often you can accuse me of throwing my wicket away, but that is what I have done in this series in order to get our run-rate up to where it is. We can't be criticised because it has rained for three days. \"Today, at the end, the umpire Cyril Mitchley called us together and said he didn't think it was fit. He said that if both teams really wanted to play they could put down mats and sawdust and stuff. \"Andy Flower obviously wanted to play. I thought it would be a bit of a farce and I didn't want to play. Nobody wants to go through like that. \"I still think that if we had played as we can, we would have beaten Zimbabwe here today even in a short game, and it would have been nice to take some confidence and form into the final. Now we feel very keen to get out of the hotel and actually do something.\" Flower saw it differently. \"I feel very disappointed. We were very hyped up for this game. We can't do anything about the weather, but I thought the conditions were okay to play from about 6.30. \"I think cricketers are a little precious some of the time. I think cricketers should be a bit tougher and play in conditions that aren't perfect. Having said that, I don't blame Nasser for taking the stance he did and in the same situation we would have had the same attitude. I just feel there should be more leeway when conditions are not quite perfect. We cricketers tip-toe around a little too much.\" The rain did stop falling before the scheduled 2.30pm start, but the downpour had taken its toll. This is the third time in two tours that England's matches at this ground have been hit by the weather: the recent Test was reduced to 1 days' play, and the match here four years ago was also hit. Curiously, no other touring team has had weather problems at Centurion. \"We talked to both captains,\" Mitchley explained. \"Having said that, it was down to the umpires and we felt that conditions were not fit. The pitch was okay and so were the run-ups. But there were damp areas on the edge of the square and the shorter the game the more of a circus it can become.\"",

      "bodyText": "Neil Hamilton has been ordered to pay \u00a3500,000 towards the reported \u00a32 million costs for his failed libel action against Harrods owner Mohamed Al Fayed, it was disclosed today. The high court has said Mr Hamilton has until 4pm on February 24 - a fortnight - to make the interim payment on account towards Mr Fayed's legal costs. Mr Hamilton said tonight: \"Of course I am aware of it, I consented to the order.\" He was not prepared to make any further comment. The order comes after Lord Harris of High Cross, who co-ordinated the former Conservative MP's \"fighting fund\" for the case, was given until February 25 to disclose the names of backers who had donated more than \u00a35,000. Mr Hamilton announced last month that he would not be mounting an appeal against the jury's decision in the action. He said he was \"penniless\" and an appeal would cost him tens of thousands of pounds. It was the third legal ruling to go Mr Fayed's way today. The Court of Appeal decided that the Sun's publication of stills from a security video of Princess Diana and Dodi Fayed visiting a Parisian villa were in breach of copyright, and ordered The Sun to pay \u00a345,000 in legal fees. Mr Fayed has also won the right to challenge a decision denying him a judicial review of home secretary Jack Straw's refusal to grant him a British passport. The right to mount the challenge comes after a high court hearing last October which upheld Mr Straw's decision that Mr Fayed was not fit to be a British citizen. A spokesman for the home office said: \"We are aware of the judgment but as this is part of an ongoing legal process we do not have any comment at this stage.\" Mr Fayed said: \"I have always held that Mr Straw's decision against me was unjust, unfair and biased, but I have always had great faith in British justice and remain quietly confident that my application will succeed in the end.\"",

Previously Mr Michael's economic minister, Mr Morgan will be ratified on Tuesday. There will be a price: wider consultation, especially with the Liberal Democrats.

But he dared not reveal it when faced with William Hague's taunts at Commons question time lest Welsh voters concluded that - yet again - Downing Street and Millbank were calling the shots.

It allowed Tory MPs - who quickly heard the news on their pagers - to demand that Mr Blair promise not to interfere in the choice of Mr Michael's successor. In reality the situation had long since slipped beyond Downing Street's control. Opposition assembly members in Cardiff used an attack on what was seen as Whitehall's lack of support for EU funding for south and west Wales to press home what was chiefly a personal attack on Mr Michael's uncharismatic and over-centralised style of management. Last night Labour AMs met in secret session to decide how best to fill the leadership vacuum created by Mr Michael's decision to jump before being formally pushed by the combined 31-27 majority of the Tories, Plaid Cymru and Liberal Democrats. One Labour AM abstained. Mr Michael, 57, the MP for Cardiff South and Penarth, became Welsh secretary and Downing Street's man in Wales after Ron Davies was forced to resign over his \"moment of madness\" on Clapham Common in October 1998. But he only narrowly beat Cardiff West's Mr Morgan, 60, in Labour's electoral college. Under the proportional voting system, Mr Michael then scraped home as an AM only via the top-up list of members with no assembly constituency. It was a shaky start that he failed to put right by bridge-building with either Labour voters or AMs in the minority administration he chose to set up - after spurning Lib Dem overtures for the kind of coalition created in Edinburgh. Last night Plaid Cymru signalled that it would not now table the motion to strip the first secretary of his powers, and give them to the assembly as a body, as it would have done if Mr Michael had insisted on being renominated to the top post. The assembly's speaker, Lord Dafydd Ellis-Thomas, rebutted suggestions that devolution was being reduced to chaos. \"This is the beginning of true devolution because the assembly has asserted its views,\" he said.",

      "body": "<p>Royal Bank of Scotland was last night on the brink of a historic \u00a323bn takeover of NatWest bank after a marathon battle with its closest rival, Bank of Scotland. </p> <p>The NatWest board, chaired by Sir David Rowland, is expected to concede today that it has won insufficient support to retain NatWest's independence as leading shareholders pledged their support for Royal Bank. </p> <p>Financial advisers to Royal Bank and NatWest began negotiations yesterday to try to agree to an orderly takeover ahead of the Valentine's day deadline by which shareholders must decide the fate of the clearing bank. </p> <p>The NatWest board, which held an emergency session yesterday morning, had been reluctant to recommend a Royal Bank bid because of its sickly share price. </p> <p>Royal Bank's shares fell a further 15% to end at \u00a39.04 yesterday. Even in any acknowledgement of defeat, NatWest will find it difficult to \"agree\" to a deal. </p> <p>Peter Burt, the chief executive of Bank of Scotland who started the audacious assault on NatWest in September, returned to Edinburgh from London where he had been due to lobby NatWest shareholders for support, although he was said to be still not quite ready to admit defeat. </p> <p>Bankers explained the fall in Royal Bank's share price as signalling an expectation of victory yesterday as the City digested pledges of support from fund management groups Schroders, Mercury and Standard Life, which yesterday said that Royal's bid was less risky that the competing one from BoS.

      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland was last night on the brink of a historic \u00a323bn takeover of NatWest bank after a marathon battle with its closest rival, Bank of Scotland. The NatWest board, chaired by Sir David Rowland, is expected to concede today that it has won insufficient support to retain NatWest's independence as leading shareholders pledged their support for Royal Bank. Financial advisers to Royal Bank and NatWest began negotiations yesterday to try to agree to an orderly takeover ahead of the Valentine's day deadline by which shareholders must decide the fate of the clearing bank. The NatWest board, which held an emergency session yesterday morning, had been reluctant to recommend a Royal Bank bid because of its sickly share price. Royal Bank's shares fell a further 15% to end at \u00a39.04 yesterday. Even in any acknowledgement of defeat, NatWest will find it difficult to \"agree\" to a deal. Peter Burt, the chief executive of Bank of Scotland who started the audacious assault on NatWest in September, returned to Edinburgh from London where he had been due to lobby NatWest shareholders for support, although he was said to be still not quite ready to admit defeat. Bankers explained the fall in Royal Bank's share price as signalling an expectation of victory yesterday as the City digested pledges of support from fund management groups Schroders, Mercury and Standard Life, which yesterday said that Royal's bid was less risky that the competing one from BoS. Tiger, a fund management group owning just under 1% of NatWest, also backed Royal Bank. Overall, Royal Bank was thought to have mustered support from 35% of NatWest's shareholders although admitted to 18% publicly. BoS has not issued a similar statement but Phillips &amp; Drew, the seventh largest shareholder in NatWest, has backed Mr Burt and his team. Royal Bank's falling share price served to slash the price of its offer, made up of cash and shares, to \u00a312.70. BoS' shares rose by 57p to 670p, increasingly the value of its offer but reflecting expectation that it might become a bid target, while NatWest's rose by 6p to \u00a311.50, still below the level of Royal's bid. The largest shareholder in NatWest, Prudential, which holds a 5% stake, refused to make its decision public last night. But that failed to quash rumours that it, too, would put its weight behind the Royal Bank bid. The Pru has been in a difficult position after its management signed a commercial deal with BoS to sell insurance in NatWest branches if its bid were successful \"The market clearly has decided that it does not wish NatWest to remain independent, and you have to conclude that Royal Bank is ahead of BoS,\" a senior fund manager said last night. But despite the apparent weight of support for Royal Bank, veterans of the fierce battle remained reluctant to call the endgame, and still worried about the possibility of a split vote, especially if Pru backed BoS. However, given the violent move in yesterday's share prices, it was apparent that if BoS was eventually the victor it would be the most stunning turnaround in recent corporate history. BoS now faces speculation that it will become a takeover target, despite a low cost base making it difficult for a predator to achieve cost savings. Speculation continued to linger in the market that Lloyds TSB, which is due to report its 1999 profits tomorrow, would find it difficult to resist a bid for Royal Bank which would spoil its takeover of NatWest. The City pointed to the two-week gap between clinching any deal with NatWest and a Royal Bank meeting of its shareholders to back the deal as a predator's window of opportunity.",

The men had died within six months of each other after an alleged campaign of racial harassment. Yesterday, Peter Hampson, West Mercia's chief constable, met the family who say that they want to meet the home secretary to urge him to order West Mercia to surrender control of the investigation to Scotland Yard. In a statement yesterday Sinead McGowan, the widow of Jason, said: \"We reiterate that the family has no confidence in West Mercia police to carry out a proper investigation. We can confirm that New Scotland Yard were willing and prepared to take on the investigation if the chief constable agreed. Peter Hampson admitted that he did not ask the question. We are now considering withdrawing our cooperation from the force that ignores the family's wishes.\" The McGowans' latest demand followed an agreement by West Mercia to reinvestigate the two deaths and to call in Scotland Yard for advice, after family protests. The family says police were too quick to dismiss the death of Harold McGowan, 34, in July 1999, as suicide, since he had been subjected to harassment and death threats by a white racist gang. Jason, 20, his nephew, who investigated his uncle's death, was also found hanging. Mrs McGowan has lodged a complaint with the police complaints authority saying the inquiry into Jason's death was bungled through racism.",

If the race discrimination case had gone ahead, the director of public prosecutions, David Calvert-Smith, would have had to undergo cross-examination by Maria Bamieh, who has already won two tribunal cases alleging race discrimination and victimisation by the CPS. She won a record payout of \u00a330,000 for injury to feelings last week after an employment tribunal in Bedford found that the service was determined to get rid of her and wanted to \"rub her face in the dirt\". The tribunal said the conduct of the CPS fell below the standard \"we would have expected of a corner shop\". The service has been hit by 22 claims of race discrimination since 1993. Last month it launched an independent inquiry under threat of a formal investigation by the commission for racial equality. Black and Asian lawyers accused the service of institutional racism and claimed they were unfairly denied equal access to promotion. Ms Bamieh, a senior lawyer, has been the most persistent in those accusations. She was offered \u00a3110,000 to leave the CPS, but was determined to keep her job. Papers disclosed to the Bedford tribunal show that Mr Calvert-Smith told her at one meeting that if she were promoted now, it would seem that a troublemaker had won. Yesterday the CPS said it had apologised to her and would promote her to a more senior position in the diversity unit. \"The settlement is seen by both parties as a real opportunity for a clean break to take place and a fresh start,\" a spokesman added.",

John Barnes has been sacked as Celtic manager two days after his team's abject capitulation against Inverness Caledonian Thistle.

His players revolted over an innovative 4-1-1-1-1-1-1 formation. Henrik Larsson was ruled out for the season with a shattered leg. Rangers took a ten-point lead in the league. And big-money buys such as Eyal Berkovic, Olivier Tebily and Stilian Petrov were described either as \"failures\" or \"****ing useless ******s\", depending on whether you were reading opinion pieces in the press or talking to a drunk bloke in an Irish theme pub in Glasgow's East End.</p> <p>Tuesday night's Cup howler against Caley Thistle was always going to be a gaffe too far for the fast-talking Englishman, especially when reports of the row Celtic enjoyed at half-time were published. According to the Mirror, bother started when Mark Viduka threw off his boots, accused Barnes of tactical naivety and was substituted. Keeper Jonathan Gould disagreed, arguing that Berkovic was the man at fault and should step down instead. This suggestion caused Barnes to retort: \"Shut up! You've not come off your line for six months!\" Blimey.</p> <p>And so it's over. But the Fiver thinks there's a lesson to be learned here for both Barnes and Celtic. Because after letting in two during the first half, Celtic only conceded one during the second. See, talking does help.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>SING-A-LONGA STANLEY</strong></p> <p>Stanley is out. The six-month bedroom siege is over and this morning, his mother's eyes welling with tears of pride, Stanley became a Fox. Martin O'Neill believes Stanley will be a \"magnificent asset\" to the club: \"We've given him a chance. What really happens now is up to him.\" But in this moment of intense joy, it seems inappropriate for the Fiver to warble on. Instead we'll let Stanley do the talking himself. Accompanied by a medley of inspiring pop classics.</p> <p>\"Obviously, most people regard taking me on as a risk, for whatever reasons, but it's a case of me forgetting the hype and getting on with my football.\" Take a chance take a chance take a take a chance chance. \"I want to play well and score goals. I want to be regarded as one of the best goalscorers in the country.\" That's what my daddy told me when I was just about knee high.</p> <p>\"As long as people are fair with me, I have never not admitted when I have done things wrong.

First John Barnes waved bye-bye. Secondly, Murray revealed to the press that while \"Cynics may look at this and think that we were never a serious bidder,\" surely not, \"I have the documents which prove that a deal was in place between myself and Kiev president Grigory Surkis.\"</p> <p>Then came the coup de grace, when Murray went on: \"We have pulled out because of something which came to our attention at a very late stage.\" What would that be then? Poor personal hygiene? A taste for vodka at breakfast? A love of pontoon and strip poker sessions with Andriy Shevchenko and Andrei Kanchelskis? It could be anything. Apart from the fact that a bunch of Euro no-hopers in a league Aberdeen can't get relegated from aren't the most attractive proposition in the world, of course.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Norwegian international striker Andreas Lund is set to join Wimbledon. Lund, who plays for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's former club Molde, has been linked with both Coventry and Spurs in the past.

What really happens now is up to him.\" But in this moment of intense joy, it seems inappropriate for the Fiver to warble on. Instead we'll let Stanley do the talking himself. Accompanied by a medley of inspiring pop classics. \"Obviously, most people regard taking me on as a risk, for whatever reasons, but it's a case of me forgetting the hype and getting on with my football.\" Take a chance take a chance take a take a chance chance. \"I want to play well and score goals. I want to be regarded as one of the best goalscorers in the country.\" That's what my daddy told me when I was just about knee high. \"As long as people are fair with me, I have never not admitted when I have done things wrong. But there has been a lot of myth.\" Stonehenge, where the virgins lie, and the prayers of devils fill the midnight sky. \"All I am saying to people is I want to be given the opportunity to have a future.\" A good heart these days is hard to find, so please be gentle with this heart of mine... * * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"Away from the park we don't socialise and we don't talk. But newspapers have been trying to say that if I get the ball, I won't pass to him and if Teddy gets it he won't pass to me. That's childish and you did those kind of things in the school playground.\" - Andy Cole on his relationship with Teddy Sheringham. It was that kind of schoolyard behaviour that stopped the Fiver turning professional, you know. * * * * * * * * * * * * * MURRAY NOT MINTED ENOUGH Three ways to cover up a humiliating failure to sign a top international striker: 1) get the manager of your local rivals sacked; 2) get some seriously substantial legal documentation which proves you could have bought him if you'd wanted to; 3) offer up a lame excuse. Rangers guvnor David Murray is so big time he only went and used all three excuses today after abandoning an ambitious \u00a312m move for Dynamo Kiev striker Sergei Rebrov. First John Barnes waved bye-bye. Secondly, Murray revealed to the press that while \"Cynics may look at this and think that we were never a serious bidder,\" surely not, \"I have the documents which prove that a deal was in place between myself and Kiev president Grigory Surkis.\" Then came the coup de grace, when Murray went on: \"We have pulled out because of something which came to our attention at a very late stage.\" What would that be then? Poor personal hygiene? A taste for vodka at breakfast? A love of pontoon and strip poker sessions with Andriy Shevchenko and Andrei Kanchelskis? It could be anything. Apart from the fact that a bunch of Euro no-hopers in a league Aberdeen can't get relegated from aren't the most attractive proposition in the world, of course. * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Norwegian international striker Andreas Lund is set to join Wimbledon. Lund, who plays for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's former club Molde, has been linked with both Coventry and Spurs in the past. Molde manager Olav Boksasp said today: \"Wimbledon and Molde have agreed on an outline agreement over the transfer of Andreas Lund.\" According to reports, Bixente Lizarazu of Bayern Munich and France underwent a strenuous medical at Anfield yesterday. Middlesbrough have joined the list of English clubs prepared to sign Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink if his stay at Atletico Madrid comes to a premature end. * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF The FA will not be investigating allegations that former chiefs Sir Bert Millichip and Ted Croker profited from their alleged involvement in PEL Stadium Seating following the Hillsborough disaster. PEL made millions from converting terraces to seating areas as recommended by Lord Justice Taylor's report into the tragedy. Millichip had no involvement in PEL while he was FA chairman and is seeing legal advice. Former FA chief executive Graham Kelly has insisted that the late Croker's name will also be cleared. Scotland and the Republic of Ireland are to meet in a friendly in Dublin on Tuesday May 30. Hibernian have completed the signing of 28-year old central defender Martin McIntosh from Stockport for \u00a3250,000.

So far, so good: many of the heroes and heroines of the classics of children's literature are orphans, while others have invisible, unmentionable or irrelevant parents. The sorrow of grieving, not to mention the terror of helplessness, is quickly glossed over in favour of the joy of a fantasised freedom. (A particularly sharp 13-year-old patiently explained to me that if Harry's parents weren't dead, there would be no point in writing the book: it wouldn't be interesting, no matter how many creative details there were.) </p> <p>The problem, for Harry Potter as for most orphans in children's books, is not the absence of parents but the presence of step-parents. From infancy Harry has been raised by his horrid Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia Dursley, who hate him and dote on their own cruel and stupid son, Dudley Dursley; they starve Harry and, when he's forced to spend summer holidays with them, they intercept his letters from his school friends, his only link with the world of people who care for him. </p> <p>Harry's dead parents, Lily and James, were not ordinary humans but a powerful witch and wizard. The Dursleys seldom speak about them, and when they do it's always with contempt, but as Harry grows up he begins to learn about them and to learn that he, too, is a wizard, though he is not (generally) allowed to use his powers in the world of the Muggles, as the witches and wizards call unmagical humans. This aspect of the story is familiar from mythological literature. Alison Lurie, praising the Harry Potter books in the New York Review of Books, saw in them 'the common childhood fantasy that the dreary adults and siblings you live with are not your real family, that you are somehow special and gifted'. </p> <p>Freud called this the Family Romance and argued for its utility in defining your apparent parents as people whom (unlike your real parents) you are allowed to desire or hate. This is the Oedipal configuration, best known from the eponymous case that Freud wrote about, but also from the myth of the birth of the hero explored by Freud's disciple, Otto Rank. The child's joyful expectation of coming someday into the greatness of his parents sustains him in the present situation of humiliation and impotence. </p> <p>The sign of Harry's greatness is a scar on his forehead, where a lightning bolt hurled by the evil wizard Voldemort hit him when he was still a baby, and would have killed him but for his mother's self-sacrificial intervention; the scar functions, like the mark of Cain, to set Harry apart. (The evil upper-form boy Malfoy calls him 'Scarhead'.) </p> <p>The Family Romance haunts the story of the ugly duckling, raised among scornful ducks until he discovers that he's really a swan. It haunts real-life adoption, too, fuelling the obsessive search for biological parents, and part of it (the rags-to-riches Cinderella part) shapes the real-life story of JK Rowling, who rose out of obscurity and deprivation to claim her literary sovereignty. Rowling has been praised for what Lurie and others regard as a particularly British talent for writing for children, but the story she tells is widespread in other cultures, too: the birth of Cyrus in Herodotus, of Krishna and Karna in the Hindu tradition, not to mention Superman in American comics. </p> <p>Rowling brings new life to the old chestnut. At the end of the first book, Harry learns from the good wizard Dumbledore why Voldemort's successor could not kill him: 'Love as powerful as your mother's leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign... to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection for ever.' In the second book, Harry explains this protection to the revenant Voldemort: 'You couldn't kill me... because my mother died to save me.' In the third book, Harry is haunted by his mother's dying screams, but now that he is older he moves on, in Lacanian fashion, to come to terms with his father. </p> <p>Thanks to a wonderfully complex and subtle episode of time travel that traces a M\u00f6bius twist in the chronological sequence, Harry encounters himself in the loop where past and present come together and overlap. The first time he lives through this period, he sees, across a lake, someone he vaguely recognises: perhaps his father? No, his father is dead, but that person sends a silver stag which saves him from present danger. </p> <p>When he goes back in time, he runs to the same place to see who it was, and there's no one else there: he is the one who sends the stag to save himself in the future. (I hesitated to divulge the surprise of this ending, but the number of people under, say, 12 who read the LRB and have not read the Harry Potter books cannot be large.) The moment when Harry realises that he mistook himself for his father is quite powerful; and it is, after all, the only real kind of time travel there is. Each of us becomes, in adulthood, someone who lived some thirty years before us, someone who must save our own life. </p> <p>The Family Romance is just one part of Harry's story; it is embedded in a familiar, very English setting, the boys' boarding school. Harry is sent to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he has strange and dangerous adventures, makes friends, and is happy for the first time in his life. Hogwarts is a modern version of the classical boarding school, now co-ed but only superficially multiracial - and still classically francophobe (all the villains have French names). There are passing references to a girl named Parvati Patel and to one black boy; and no Jewish names. </p> <p>Class, rather than race or religion, is the central issue, and sometimes makes Hogwarts seem like a public school of the Thirties: Harry, who is poor in the Muggle world (his glasses are mended with tape), though he has secret deposits of gold in the magic world, is taunted by the rich, snobbish, cowardly, cruel Malfoy, who is backed by his powerful, manipulative father and talks a lot of proto-Nazi drivel about pure blood. But the true epoch of Hogwarts is medieval: it teaches things like Potions, Transfiguration and Defence against the Dark Arts (a hard post to keep filled). </p> <p>Besides the Family Romance and the schooldays genre, Rowling weaves in a third inherited theme: what might be called the banality of magic. This is magic which is used not to slay dragons or turn men into swine but to slide up the banister (as Mary Poppins does) or to light fires instantly in damp weather (as the Hogwarts wizards do). Harry is told that people who read without permission a book called Sonnets of a Sorcerer are cursed to speak in limericks for the rest of their lives, and there's a charm to demist your glasses in the rain (which proves to be of crucial use for Harry during a Quidditch match on a foul day). There's also a clock that, instead of saying the hours and minutes, says: 'You're late,' and 'Time to make tea.' </p> <p>Hogwarts is reached by a train that leaves from Platform 9 3/4 at King's Cross, visible only to people who know where to look for it. The ceiling in the school dining hall is a constantly changing lifelike simulation of the sky, and the portraits are alive: they visit one another and talk to the people outside the frames. Though Games loom large, the game of Quidditch is played in the air on flying broomsticks. (For most American children, upper-form boys treating the lower forms as slaves will seem even weirder than people flying around on broomsticks.) </p> <p>Life at Hogwarts is very different from the life Harry is condemned to live with the Dursleys, but not all that different from the Muggle world in general. The social situations are the same; the people are just the same; and the tasks are the same - go to classes, do homework, pass exams. All that's different is the extended powers of people at Hogwarts, which are not unlike the powers imagined in futuristic novels. Hogwarts is in our world, but pieces of magic are studded in it here and there, almost at random. The line between the magic and non-magic worlds is further blurred when magic is used in the Muggle world. This happens more often than you might think (some Muggle-baiters amuse themselves by putting spells on Muggles' keys so that they shrink to nothing and can't be found), but a Forgetfulness potion is always used to wipe out all record of it. </p> <p>Rowling handles quite well the inconsistency that follows from having magic forbidden in some situations and allowed in others; a Hogwarts nurse can mend broken bones overnight, but no one can fix a magic broomstick when it shatters on a tree. The line between the things that you can and cannot change (as in time travel) might seem arbitrary. Why not just use magic to get all the answers right in exams? Because it's no fun that way; so the quill pens used in exams are bewitched with an Anti-Cheating spell. This is magic played according to Hoyle, with one hand - the narrative hand - tied behind its back. </p> <p>The fact that the Harry Potter books are an amalgam of at least three familiar genres works for, not against, their spectacular success. (In December, the three books occupied the first three spots on the New York Times bestseller list, where they had been for 50, 25 and 11 weeks respectively.) Myths survive for centuries, in a succession of incarnations, both because they are available and because they are intrinsically charismatic. Rowling is a wizard herself at the magic art of bricolage: new stories crafted out of recycled pieces of old stories. As I began to read the books, my inner child, as they say, steeped in children's classics, joined forces with my adult self, a comparative mythologist, and I found myself unable to resist playing the game of 'Can You Spot the Source?', a philologist's variant on the old children's game of 'How Many Animals Can You Find Hiding in This Picture?' (there was always a stag in the trees, whose branches were his antlers).</p> <p>I found the Family Romance of King Arthur, particularly as reincarnated in TH White's Sword in the Stone, in the magic weapon that no one but Harry can wield, and in the gift of talking to animals that White's Merlin gives to Arthur (Harry just does snakes). Where Mary Poppins gave the children a medicine that tasted different for each of them (each one's favourite taste), Rowling gives us Every Flavour Beans, always a surprise. The talking chess pieces from Through the Looking-Glass appear here as small pieces on a conventional board, but they talk back when you move them: 'Don't send me there, can't you see his knight? Send him, we can afford to lose him.' </p> <p>Snow White's talking mirror appears, but Rowling transforms it both with humour (the mirror over the mantelpiece shouts at Harry, 'Tuck your shirt in, scruffy!' and whispers, 'You're fighting a losing battle there, dear,' when he attempts to plaster down his cowlick) and with something deeper: there is a mirror that shows you your heart's desire (Harry imagines his mother, 'a very pretty woman... her eyes are just like mine,' and his father, whose hair 'stuck up at the back, just as Harry's did'). And where both Peter Pan and Mary Poppins taught children to fly or float by thinking happy thoughts, Rowling takes the concept into a more sinister area.</p> <p> Harry learns that the only way to defend himself against the Dementors, who will destroy him by assuming the form of what he most fears, is by mentally conjuring up a Patronus, 'a projection of the very things that the Dementor feeds upon - hope, happiness, the desire to survive'; and he overpowers one Dementor by imagining life with a loving father-figure who has offered to adopt him. After a while, however, the collage began to transcend its piecemeal sources, and I stopped playing the philologist's game. But children who do not read - and much of the dancing in the streets celebrating Rowling's success comes from the fact that most of the Harry Potter crowd are allegedly converted hardcore television and video-game addicts - will here encounter the charisma of Lewis, Carroll, Barrie, Tolkien, Nesbitt and Travers, not to mention Dickens and Stevenson, all at once. </p> <p>The old themes are continually fleshed out with touches of comic genius. There are child-pleasing scenes of mayhem, as when the pixies get loose in the Defence against the Dark Arts class, or the bookstore sells the Monster Book of Monsters, which has to be kept in a cage ('Torn pages were flying everywhere as the books grappled with each other, locked together in furious wrestling matches and snapping aggressively') - the bookseller weeps when someone insists on buying two. And when one boy's wand gets bent, his curses rebound on him; on one noteworthy occasion, he vomits black slugs for several hours. </p> <p>There are also lovely moments of whimsy and satire. The final exam in the class on Transfiguration is to turn a teapot into a tortoise; afterwards the students compare notes ('Were the tortoises supposed to breathe steam?' 'It still had a willow-patterned shell, d'you think that'll count against me?'). And there is gallows humour: Professor Sprout grows a crop of anthropomorphic Mandrakes to chop up and use in a potion to revive certain petrified children; waiting for them to mature so that she can harvest them, she is heartened when they get spots and throw a loud and raucous party. 'The moment they start trying to move into each others' pots,' she tells Harry, 'we'll know they're fully mature.' </p> <p>The fights adults have waged over the innocent body of these books are far more childish than the fights of the children inside the books. The books' US editor, Arthur Levine, translated for the benefit of benighted Americans British words like 'wonky' (to 'crooked'), 'bobbles' (to 'puff balls'), 'barking mad' (to 'complete lunatic'), and 'bogey' (to 'booger'), while leaving in their pristine arcaneness 'ickle', 'nutters' and 'humbugs'. He even translated the first title, from 'philosopher's stone' to 'sorcerer's stone', apparently on the assumption that Americans have never heard of alchemy and should be encouraged, instead, to think of Mickey Mouse in Fantasia. </p> <p>Some of his changes seem superfluous, some of them remain equally arcane, and some fall between two stools and are mired in mid-Atlantic translatorese: 'cracking' becomes 'spanking good', which has surely never escaped the barrier of any American teeth; and translating 'Sellotape' as 'Scotchtape' loses the pun on 'Spellotape' (used to mend broken wands). American children have protested, in places as sophisticated as the New Yorker's 'Talk of the Town', against this insult to their intelligence. </p> <p>A stupider fight has been waged by parents (some of whom identify themselves as 'born-again Christians' and are known to others as the Mullahs of the Midwest) who have outlawed the Harry Potter books in American schools; legal challenges have been filed in at least eight states, and some evangelical ministers have preached against the books' satanic allegiance. Apparently, their astonishing popularity is taken as evidence of a Faustian bargain, the work of the devil. (How else can you get on the New York Times bestseller list?)</p> <p>In an ironic twist, some parents have cited the First Amendment and argued that witchcraft (i.e. the Potterian heresy) should not be taught in school because it is a religion; somehow this has failed to ignite the watchful passions of the American Civil Liberties Union. 'I realised that it's for my own sake that I'm not listening,' one child whose parents forbade him to listen to Potter readings reported. 'There's a lot about witchcraft and evil and spells and magic. I was taught at church that that was not good.' No doubt C.S. Lewis's Narnia books slipped through because of their thinly veiled Christian message (Aslan as the Lamb of God), not to mention their anti-Muslim message (the worshippers of the evil Tash are dark-skinned men in turbans). On the other hand, when Lewis's books were first published, covens of real witches were not as prominent as they are now; always popular, Narnia is enjoying a resurgence in Harry's wake. </p> <p>Events at Columbine High School last year may explain the reaction of some American parents who have opposed the Harry Potter books. The students who shot and killed their classmates said they were out to get the school bullies, and were themselves part of a widespread teen cult inspired to some degree by The Matrix (the students dressed like the film's heroes). The Matrix invoked the ancient criteria of rule-breaking excellence - innovation, courage, creativity - but also of lawlessness and anarchy: the film imagines a world of computers that create an alternative reality through the kind of mind control that is also at the heart of Harry Potter's magic. (The Matrix even exploits the banality of magic: the oracle is a woman just like your aunt, who bakes cookies and has magnets on her fridge.) </p> <p>The alternative reality of The Matrix is made possible by a new, computer magic (nouveau-Orientalist rather than vieux-Brit) which is both the medium of the film (its stunning special effects) and its message, the antinomian ethic of the new capitalism. This greedy, solipsistic ethic extends far beyond the film; television advertisements for some computer products boast of 'breaking the rules, remaking the rules'. This is understandably scary stuff for the more repressive sort of parents (who may also be troubled by the popularity of the premise of their own dispensability in books such as these). It gives them nightmares that make them want to burn Harry Potter at the stake. </p> <p>Harry Potter, too, has moments of computer magic: a more banal version of his magic map which shows people moving on its surface is available at most Hertz and Avis headquarters, not to mention in high-tech alarm systems. But most of the magic is of another kind, dependent on education and mental training. Indeed, where the protests go wrong is in assuming that, since magic does not seem to obey the rules of either science or religion, it has no rules at all. This is certainly not the case. Harry Potter must abide, not only by the complex moral rules of magic, but even by the moral rules dictating when to use, and when not to use, magic. More important, the world of Harry Potter is deeply coloured by a Victorian code of public-school loyalty that offers a positive antidote to the 'no holds barred' capitalism of the computer world which some parents have wrongly conflated with the world of magic. </p> <p>In its original form, the code represented a kind of parity among the privileged, a noblesse oblige that gave a veneer of democracy to an imperialist and militarist class. This code, 'Never let the side down' and, above all, 'Never snitch', was seldom invoked in 20th-century America - except, perhaps, during the McCarthy trials. It was replaced by the sauve qui peut mentality best epitomised, for me, in a wonderful game called 'So long, Sucker', invented by four economists in 1964; the object of this game for four players is to get someone to go into partnership with you and then double-cross them. </p> <p>Though these books have not (yet) been burnt, they have gone underground: a new plaincover edition has appeared in the UK, for grown-ups who don't want to be seen reading a children's book. (I was reminded of the old Mad Magazine edition printed to look like a black and white school notebook.) The 'adult' edition (an ironic twist on the contemporary meaning of 'adult', designating hard-core pornography) costs two pounds more but has already sold more than 20,000 copies. Clearly this is pretty hot stuff, subversive literature. 'Some old witch in Bath had a book that you could never stop reading!' one of Harry's friends informs him. 'You just had to wander around with your nose in it, trying to do everything one-handed.' That old witch must have been called Rowling. </p> <p>\u0095 To read more online essays from the current edition of the London Review of Books visit the <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">LRB</a>.

So far, so good: many of the heroes and heroines of the classics of children's literature are orphans, while others have invisible, unmentionable or irrelevant parents. The sorrow of grieving, not to mention the terror of helplessness, is quickly glossed over in favour of the joy of a fantasised freedom. (A particularly sharp 13-year-old patiently explained to me that if Harry's parents weren't dead, there would be no point in writing the book: it wouldn't be interesting, no matter how many creative details there were.) The problem, for Harry Potter as for most orphans in children's books, is not the absence of parents but the presence of step-parents. From infancy Harry has been raised by his horrid Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia Dursley, who hate him and dote on their own cruel and stupid son, Dudley Dursley; they starve Harry and, when he's forced to spend summer holidays with them, they intercept his letters from his school friends, his only link with the world of people who care for him. Harry's dead parents, Lily and James, were not ordinary humans but a powerful witch and wizard. The Dursleys seldom speak about them, and when they do it's always with contempt, but as Harry grows up he begins to learn about them and to learn that he, too, is a wizard, though he is not (generally) allowed to use his powers in the world of the Muggles, as the witches and wizards call unmagical humans. This aspect of the story is familiar from mythological literature. Alison Lurie, praising the Harry Potter books in the New York Review of Books, saw in them 'the common childhood fantasy that the dreary adults and siblings you live with are not your real family, that you are somehow special and gifted'. Freud called this the Family Romance and argued for its utility in defining your apparent parents as people whom (unlike your real parents) you are allowed to desire or hate. This is the Oedipal configuration, best known from the eponymous case that Freud wrote about, but also from the myth of the birth of the hero explored by Freud's disciple, Otto Rank. The child's joyful expectation of coming someday into the greatness of his parents sustains him in the present situation of humiliation and impotence. The sign of Harry's greatness is a scar on his forehead, where a lightning bolt hurled by the evil wizard Voldemort hit him when he was still a baby, and would have killed him but for his mother's self-sacrificial intervention; the scar functions, like the mark of Cain, to set Harry apart. (The evil upper-form boy Malfoy calls him 'Scarhead'.) The Family Romance haunts the story of the ugly duckling, raised among scornful ducks until he discovers that he's really a swan. It haunts real-life adoption, too, fuelling the obsessive search for biological parents, and part of it (the rags-to-riches Cinderella part) shapes the real-life story of JK Rowling, who rose out of obscurity and deprivation to claim her literary sovereignty. Rowling has been praised for what Lurie and others regard as a particularly British talent for writing for children, but the story she tells is widespread in other cultures, too: the birth of Cyrus in Herodotus, of Krishna and Karna in the Hindu tradition, not to mention Superman in American comics. Rowling brings new life to the old chestnut. At the end of the first book, Harry learns from the good wizard Dumbledore why Voldemort's successor could not kill him: 'Love as powerful as your mother's leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign... to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection for ever.' In the second book, Harry explains this protection to the revenant Voldemort: 'You couldn't kill me... because my mother died to save me.' In the third book, Harry is haunted by his mother's dying screams, but now that he is older he moves on, in Lacanian fashion, to come to terms with his father. Thanks to a wonderfully complex and subtle episode of time travel that traces a M\u00f6bius twist in the chronological sequence, Harry encounters himself in the loop where past and present come together and overlap. The first time he lives through this period, he sees, across a lake, someone he vaguely recognises: perhaps his father? No, his father is dead, but that person sends a silver stag which saves him from present danger. When he goes back in time, he runs to the same place to see who it was, and there's no one else there: he is the one who sends the stag to save himself in the future. (I hesitated to divulge the surprise of this ending, but the number of people under, say, 12 who read the LRB and have not read the Harry Potter books cannot be large.) The moment when Harry realises that he mistook himself for his father is quite powerful; and it is, after all, the only real kind of time travel there is. Each of us becomes, in adulthood, someone who lived some thirty years before us, someone who must save our own life. The Family Romance is just one part of Harry's story; it is embedded in a familiar, very English setting, the boys' boarding school. Harry is sent to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he has strange and dangerous adventures, makes friends, and is happy for the first time in his life. Hogwarts is a modern version of the classical boarding school, now co-ed but only superficially multiracial - and still classically francophobe (all the villains have French names). There are passing references to a girl named Parvati Patel and to one black boy; and no Jewish names. Class, rather than race or religion, is the central issue, and sometimes makes Hogwarts seem like a public school of the Thirties: Harry, who is poor in the Muggle world (his glasses are mended with tape), though he has secret deposits of gold in the magic world, is taunted by the rich, snobbish, cowardly, cruel Malfoy, who is backed by his powerful, manipulative father and talks a lot of proto-Nazi drivel about pure blood. But the true epoch of Hogwarts is medieval: it teaches things like Potions, Transfiguration and Defence against the Dark Arts (a hard post to keep filled). Besides the Family Romance and the schooldays genre, Rowling weaves in a third inherited theme: what might be called the banality of magic. This is magic which is used not to slay dragons or turn men into swine but to slide up the banister (as Mary Poppins does) or to light fires instantly in damp weather (as the Hogwarts wizards do). Harry is told that people who read without permission a book called Sonnets of a Sorcerer are cursed to speak in limericks for the rest of their lives, and there's a charm to demist your glasses in the rain (which proves to be of crucial use for Harry during a Quidditch match on a foul day). There's also a clock that, instead of saying the hours and minutes, says: 'You're late,' and 'Time to make tea.' Hogwarts is reached by a train that leaves from Platform 9 3/4 at King's Cross, visible only to people who know where to look for it. The ceiling in the school dining hall is a constantly changing lifelike simulation of the sky, and the portraits are alive: they visit one another and talk to the people outside the frames. Though Games loom large, the game of Quidditch is played in the air on flying broomsticks. (For most American children, upper-form boys treating the lower forms as slaves will seem even weirder than people flying around on broomsticks.) Life at Hogwarts is very different from the life Harry is condemned to live with the Dursleys, but not all that different from the Muggle world in general. The social situations are the same; the people are just the same; and the tasks are the same - go to classes, do homework, pass exams. All that's different is the extended powers of people at Hogwarts, which are not unlike the powers imagined in futuristic novels. Hogwarts is in our world, but pieces of magic are studded in it here and there, almost at random. The line between the magic and non-magic worlds is further blurred when magic is used in the Muggle world. This happens more often than you might think (some Muggle-baiters amuse themselves by putting spells on Muggles' keys so that they shrink to nothing and can't be found), but a Forgetfulness potion is always used to wipe out all record of it. Rowling handles quite well the inconsistency that follows from having magic forbidden in some situations and allowed in others; a Hogwarts nurse can mend broken bones overnight, but no one can fix a magic broomstick when it shatters on a tree. The line between the things that you can and cannot change (as in time travel) might seem arbitrary. Why not just use magic to get all the answers right in exams? Because it's no fun that way; so the quill pens used in exams are bewitched with an Anti-Cheating spell. This is magic played according to Hoyle, with one hand - the narrative hand - tied behind its back. The fact that the Harry Potter books are an amalgam of at least three familiar genres works for, not against, their spectacular success. (In December, the three books occupied the first three spots on the New York Times bestseller list, where they had been for 50, 25 and 11 weeks respectively.) Myths survive for centuries, in a succession of incarnations, both because they are available and because they are intrinsically charismatic. Rowling is a wizard herself at the magic art of bricolage: new stories crafted out of recycled pieces of old stories. As I began to read the books, my inner child, as they say, steeped in children's classics, joined forces with my adult self, a comparative mythologist, and I found myself unable to resist playing the game of 'Can You Spot the Source?', a philologist's variant on the old children's game of 'How Many Animals Can You Find Hiding in This Picture?' (there was always a stag in the trees, whose branches were his antlers). I found the Family Romance of King Arthur, particularly as reincarnated in TH White's Sword in the Stone, in the magic weapon that no one but Harry can wield, and in the gift of talking to animals that White's Merlin gives to Arthur (Harry just does snakes). Where Mary Poppins gave the children a medicine that tasted different for each of them (each one's favourite taste), Rowling gives us Every Flavour Beans, always a surprise. The talking chess pieces from Through the Looking-Glass appear here as small pieces on a conventional board, but they talk back when you move them: 'Don't send me there, can't you see his knight? Send him, we can afford to lose him.' Snow White's talking mirror appears, but Rowling transforms it both with humour (the mirror over the mantelpiece shouts at Harry, 'Tuck your shirt in, scruffy!' and whispers, 'You're fighting a losing battle there, dear,' when he attempts to plaster down his cowlick) and with something deeper: there is a mirror that shows you your heart's desire (Harry imagines his mother, 'a very pretty woman... her eyes are just like mine,' and his father, whose hair 'stuck up at the back, just as Harry's did'). And where both Peter Pan and Mary Poppins taught children to fly or float by thinking happy thoughts, Rowling takes the concept into a more sinister area. Harry learns that the only way to defend himself against the Dementors, who will destroy him by assuming the form of what he most fears, is by mentally conjuring up a Patronus, 'a projection of the very things that the Dementor feeds upon - hope, happiness, the desire to survive'; and he overpowers one Dementor by imagining life with a loving father-figure who has offered to adopt him. After a while, however, the collage began to transcend its piecemeal sources, and I stopped playing the philologist's game. But children who do not read - and much of the dancing in the streets celebrating Rowling's success comes from the fact that most of the Harry Potter crowd are allegedly converted hardcore television and video-game addicts - will here encounter the charisma of Lewis, Carroll, Barrie, Tolkien, Nesbitt and Travers, not to mention Dickens and Stevenson, all at once. The old themes are continually fleshed out with touches of comic genius. There are child-pleasing scenes of mayhem, as when the pixies get loose in the Defence against the Dark Arts class, or the bookstore sells the Monster Book of Monsters, which has to be kept in a cage ('Torn pages were flying everywhere as the books grappled with each other, locked together in furious wrestling matches and snapping aggressively') - the bookseller weeps when someone insists on buying two. And when one boy's wand gets bent, his curses rebound on him; on one noteworthy occasion, he vomits black slugs for several hours. There are also lovely moments of whimsy and satire. The final exam in the class on Transfiguration is to turn a teapot into a tortoise; afterwards the students compare notes ('Were the tortoises supposed to breathe steam?' 'It still had a willow-patterned shell, d'you think that'll count against me?'). And there is gallows humour: Professor Sprout grows a crop of anthropomorphic Mandrakes to chop up and use in a potion to revive certain petrified children; waiting for them to mature so that she can harvest them, she is heartened when they get spots and throw a loud and raucous party. 'The moment they start trying to move into each others' pots,' she tells Harry, 'we'll know they're fully mature.' The fights adults have waged over the innocent body of these books are far more childish than the fights of the children inside the books. The books' US editor, Arthur Levine, translated for the benefit of benighted Americans British words like 'wonky' (to 'crooked'), 'bobbles' (to 'puff balls'), 'barking mad' (to 'complete lunatic'), and 'bogey' (to 'booger'), while leaving in their pristine arcaneness 'ickle', 'nutters' and 'humbugs'. He even translated the first title, from 'philosopher's stone' to 'sorcerer's stone', apparently on the assumption that Americans have never heard of alchemy and should be encouraged, instead, to think of Mickey Mouse in Fantasia. Some of his changes seem superfluous, some of them remain equally arcane, and some fall between two stools and are mired in mid-Atlantic translatorese: 'cracking' becomes 'spanking good', which has surely never escaped the barrier of any American teeth; and translating 'Sellotape' as 'Scotchtape' loses the pun on 'Spellotape' (used to mend broken wands). American children have protested, in places as sophisticated as the New Yorker's 'Talk of the Town', against this insult to their intelligence. A stupider fight has been waged by parents (some of whom identify themselves as 'born-again Christians' and are known to others as the Mullahs of the Midwest) who have outlawed the Harry Potter books in American schools; legal challenges have been filed in at least eight states, and some evangelical ministers have preached against the books' satanic allegiance. Apparently, their astonishing popularity is taken as evidence of a Faustian bargain, the work of the devil. (How else can you get on the New York Times bestseller list?) In an ironic twist, some parents have cited the First Amendment and argued that witchcraft (i.e. the Potterian heresy) should not be taught in school because it is a religion; somehow this has failed to ignite the watchful passions of the American Civil Liberties Union. 'I realised that it's for my own sake that I'm not listening,' one child whose parents forbade him to listen to Potter readings reported. 'There's a lot about witchcraft and evil and spells and magic. I was taught at church that that was not good.' No doubt C.S. Lewis's Narnia books slipped through because of their thinly veiled Christian message (Aslan as the Lamb of God), not to mention their anti-Muslim message (the worshippers of the evil Tash are dark-skinned men in turbans). On the other hand, when Lewis's books were first published, covens of real witches were not as prominent as they are now; always popular, Narnia is enjoying a resurgence in Harry's wake. Events at Columbine High School last year may explain the reaction of some American parents who have opposed the Harry Potter books. The students who shot and killed their classmates said they were out to get the school bullies, and were themselves part of a widespread teen cult inspired to some degree by The Matrix (the students dressed like the film's heroes). The Matrix invoked the ancient criteria of rule-breaking excellence - innovation, courage, creativity - but also of lawlessness and anarchy: the film imagines a world of computers that create an alternative reality through the kind of mind control that is also at the heart of Harry Potter's magic. (The Matrix even exploits the banality of magic: the oracle is a woman just like your aunt, who bakes cookies and has magnets on her fridge.) The alternative reality of The Matrix is made possible by a new, computer magic (nouveau-Orientalist rather than vieux-Brit) which is both the medium of the film (its stunning special effects) and its message, the antinomian ethic of the new capitalism. This greedy, solipsistic ethic extends far beyond the film; television advertisements for some computer products boast of 'breaking the rules, remaking the rules'. This is understandably scary stuff for the more repressive sort of parents (who may also be troubled by the popularity of the premise of their own dispensability in books such as these). It gives them nightmares that make them want to burn Harry Potter at the stake. Harry Potter, too, has moments of computer magic: a more banal version of his magic map which shows people moving on its surface is available at most Hertz and Avis headquarters, not to mention in high-tech alarm systems. But most of the magic is of another kind, dependent on education and mental training. Indeed, where the protests go wrong is in assuming that, since magic does not seem to obey the rules of either science or religion, it has no rules at all. This is certainly not the case. Harry Potter must abide, not only by the complex moral rules of magic, but even by the moral rules dictating when to use, and when not to use, magic. More important, the world of Harry Potter is deeply coloured by a Victorian code of public-school loyalty that offers a positive antidote to the 'no holds barred' capitalism of the computer world which some parents have wrongly conflated with the world of magic. In its original form, the code represented a kind of parity among the privileged, a noblesse oblige that gave a veneer of democracy to an imperialist and militarist class. This code, 'Never let the side down' and, above all, 'Never snitch', was seldom invoked in 20th-century America - except, perhaps, during the McCarthy trials. It was replaced by the sauve qui peut mentality best epitomised, for me, in a wonderful game called 'So long, Sucker', invented by four economists in 1964; the object of this game for four players is to get someone to go into partnership with you and then double-cross them. Though these books have not (yet) been burnt, they have gone underground: a new plaincover edition has appeared in the UK, for grown-ups who don't want to be seen reading a children's book. (I was reminded of the old Mad Magazine edition printed to look like a black and white school notebook.) The 'adult' edition (an ironic twist on the contemporary meaning of 'adult', designating hard-core pornography) costs two pounds more but has already sold more than 20,000 copies. Clearly this is pretty hot stuff, subversive literature. 'Some old witch in Bath had a book that you could never stop reading!' one of Harry's friends informs him. 'You just had to wander around with your nose in it, trying to do everything one-handed.' That old witch must have been called Rowling. \u0095 To read more online essays from the current edition of the London Review of Books visit the LRB.

So far, only eight or nine shops in London's West End are members and, since its launch in November, only about 50 people have been put on the system. But the more shops that join the scheme, the more effective it becomes; potentially, the database could be enormous.

It uses its CCTV system to send information back to the computerised database, and actively scan for criminals. If a face fits, the police are alerted. </p> <p>\"Just as the police put a ring of steel round the city when we had a terrorist threat, checking every vehicle that came into London, so we are trying to get a ring of steel round our shopping centres,\" says Bob Lack, operations manager for security systems at Newham council. </p> <p>In the first six months of the trial, crime fell by 35% in the places being surveyed by CCTV.

And if a face is angled more than 35% away from the camera, in any direction, it gets confused. </p> <p>In 1998, \u00a3604m of goods were stolen from shops in Britain, and deterring theft is an obvious application.

There are a number of voluntary codes of practice and local authorities adhere to guidelines, but the trouble is that they are fine for the good guys, but do nothing to catch the bad guys.

There is an old argument that the innocent have nothing to fear, but Parratt doesn't buy it. \"If you say that, then there's never an argument against surveillance, and I wouldn't want to be under surveillance 24 hours a day. Also, CCTV systems are completely unregulated. There are a number of voluntary codes of practice and local authorities adhere to guidelines, but the trouble is that they are fine for the good guys, but do nothing to catch the bad guys. What's important is that there should be a public debate. Otherwise, in a few years' time, we could find we're in a place we don't want to be.\"",

      "bodyText": "Home secretary Jack Straw signalled today that he would personally seek to send back all those on board the hijacked Afghan aircraft, after the peaceful end to the four-day drama at Stansted airport early this morning. In a special Commons statement, Mr Straw announced he was taking the extraordinary step of personally deciding on any applications, in a bid to head off right-wing criticism that Britain was seen as a \"soft touch\" on asylum seekers. \"Subject to compliance with all legal requirements, I would wish to see removed from this country all those on the plane as soon as reasonably practicable,\" he told the Commons. \"As a matter of public policy, I believe that the clearest and unequivocal signals must be sent out so as to discourage hijacking, whatever its motive,\" Mr Straw said. \"While I must and will act in accordance with the law, I am determined that nobody should consider that there can be any benefit to be obtained by hijacking.\" Of those on the plane, 60 had so far told immigration officers they wished to apply for asylum along with 14 dependants. The remainder had yet to make their wishes known. Mr Straw pledged to \"respond resolutely to any attempts like this to use terrorist methods, whether the aim is to advance a political cause or to benefit the individuals concerned\". He explained that the hijacked plane had been allowed to land at Stansted in accordance with Britain's \"international obligations\". There had been \"serious concerns about the safety of those on board, given the threats that had been made earlier to kill passengers, uncertainty over fuel levels and reports of technical problems\". Mr Straw said no political demands were made at any time following the plane's arrival at Stansted, although statements were made to negotiators about the political situation in Afghanistan. No undertakings \"of any kind concerning asylum\" had been given by government representatives during the negotiations and \"the surrender from the plane was unconditional\". Shadow home secretary Ann Widdecombe told MPs a deterrent to future hijacks would be to ensure Britain's asylum procedures were not \"noticeably softer\" than those in surrounding countries. \"Why the United Kingdom?\" Miss Widdecombe asked. \"Why did it decide that it would land here and try to take advantage of our asylum procedures? Is it that those procedures are known to be rather more congenial than some which appertain in other countries which are nevertheless still signatories to the 1951 convention [on refugees] and to the ECHR (European court of human rights)?\" She welcomed the home secretary's decision to decide the asylum applications personally but stressed that speed was of the essence. Mr Straw agreed speed was important in processing asylum seekers' claims and said special arrangements had been put in place with that aim. Liberal Democrat spokesman Simon Hughes said rules should be set down if the home secretary was going to start \"calling in\" immigration and asylum applications on a regular basis, as he recently did with boxer Mike Tyson. \"Can we have rules that govern that just as one does for calling in planning applications, rather than you simply being able to pick and mix with nobody knowing whether they are going to get special fast treatment from you or the normal treatment from somebody else?\"",

      "bodyText": "Air piracy, whatever the motivation for it, is a hideous crime. On that we can all agree. The men who brandished guns and grenades before 150 terrified passengers and crew of the Ariana aircraft, and brought them to a foreign land at peril of all their lives, deserve neither sympathy nor leniency. We do not know yet what drove the hijackers to their desperate action. At first, it was thought they hoped to hold the passengers hostage against the release of Ismail Khan, an Afghan warlord imprisoned by the Taliban regime. In recent days, a more mundane motive has been suggested, namely that the hijackers were simply desperate to escape the horrors of life in Afghanistan. That speculation has sparked a tangential debate about asylum seekers - a subject which seems to bring out the very worst in us. The Conservative leader William Hague very properly is demanding information this morning about the exact status of the hijackers and indeed of their hostages, some of whom may well apply for asylum. But he went on: \"We don't want, we must not allow, this country to reinforce its growing image as a soft touch for asylum seekers... This cannot become the way to seek political asylum on top of all the other ways that exist already.\" This kind of language is irresponsible as well as distasteful. The idea that the skies above Stansted will be darkened by squadrons of incoming hijackers is patently ludicrous. But more insidious by far is the notion of Britain as \"a soft touch\" for refugees. There is nothing \"soft\" in the life of a refugee. Those who are forced, by terror or by economic deprivation, to flee their own country are by definition at the bottom of the heap of humanity. Sure, there are some, maybe many, in the growing tide of asylum seekers in this country who have come to con the system; to exaggerate their plight in the hope of a handout. But we can safely dismiss that as a factor in the Stansted hijack. Whatever crazed and desperate schemes are dreamed up in Kabul, they do not include elaborate scams to get hold of giro cheques in Britain. Before we can begin to understand what drove these men to commit their crime, we must know a little about, quite literally, where they are coming from. Afghanistan is a wasteland. It has endured more than 20 years of superpower proxy conflict and vicious civil war. It has been devastated by the Soviet army and by the mujaheddin resistance armed by the west, principally the USA and Britain. It is now torn and bleeding, without any recognisable government. Justice in Afghanistan is an ugly thing. When the Taliban came to power, they dragged the last communist dictator, Najibullah, from his refuge in a Kabul UN compound, shot him and hung his bloody corpse from a lamp-post. Both the Taliban and their equally brutal opponents make a virtue of public hangings. Abdul Rashid Dostum, a warlord in the north whose allegiance changed with the breeze, adopted a favourite Russian punishment: he strapped those who offended him to tank tracks, and had them pulped. These and many other horrors are part of what Afghanistan has become, and we helped make it so. Hague's heroine, Margaret Thatcher, was as ardent as any in her support of the obscurantist bigots who tore their country to bits. This is not to suggest that all Afghans are barbarians. Far from it; it is a plea for some understanding and sympathy for the millions who live in the wreckage of an ancient seat of civilisation. Sending back the hijackers, and indeed those of their victims who apply for asylum, would make us accomplices in the terror which now grips Afghanistan.

The deal will give a boost to extreme rightwing groups in other European countries. It potentially threatens the identity and cohesion of the EU and of other pan-European institutions that arose from the ashes of Europe's fascist era.</p> <p>Mr Haider's mendacious repackaging of the old agenda of hate, racism and fear challenges every individual, too, to say clearly what he or she believes, and to act on it. For if we accept the possibility of human progress, then we must accept and draw on the lessons of the past. There can be no prevarication, no fudging, no blas\u00e9, comforting pretence that the threat is overstated and will soon recede. Nor can there be any accommodation. We should all know where that historically leads. For Mr Haider, emboldened by his success, makes no secret of the fact that he hopes to take the chancellorship outright next time around.</p> <p>In this context the swift decision of 14 EU member governments to quarantine the 15th, Austria, is welcome. This is not a case of bullying by Brussels. The d\u00e9marche was undertaken without prior reference to Romano Prodi or his European Commission. Nor is it a right-left issue, or in any sense an ideological battle, for no party holds exclusive rights to bigotry. The criticism that is raining down on the wretched Mr Sch\u00fcssel - whose ambition to become chancellor overwhelmed his responsibility to his country - comes from democrats of all persuasions, appalled by a grotesque distortion of the people's will. It is a great shame that the Freedom party's 27% share of the vote has translated into half the government posts. It is a great pity that Viktor Klima, leader of the largest party, the Social Democrats, which belatedly called for fresh elections, failed to show more nous. It is chilling that after all that has passed since Anschluss, so many Austrians, ignoring history, appear to prefer a smug, revisionist chauvinism that can find a senior role in its political system for a man who admires Hitler's employment policies and praises former SS officers.</p> <p>The assertion that external, anti-Haider pressure constitutes a gross interference in Austria's internal affairs does not bear scrutiny. For Austria does not somehow inhabit a moral universe all its own. \"It is an expression that we stand for a Europe based on shared values [that] Mr Haider has constantly violated,\" said Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, Germany's chancellor. His foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, added: \"The EU cannot accept that xenophobia and rightwing extremism become part of government.\" Italy's prime minister, Massimo D'Alema, said simply: \"Europe has certain criteria and values that unite it.\"</p> <p>It was plain that, in the end, outsiders could not dictate to Austria the composition of its government. But it remains equally plain that as a member of the Western democratic community of nations as much as the EU itself, Austria, like a wayward child, had to be left in no doubt what the consequences of its actions would be. Now those warnings have been effectively ignored, and the deserved isolation and ostracism of Austria will begin.</p> <p>Mr Sch\u00fcssel protests that Austria is not a pariah state. He is wrong. Despite Mr Haider's grandiose, unbelievable last-minute pledges to clean up his act, there should be no wavering. For individuals, companies and governments that would uphold the values of a free society, there must be no business-as-usual with Austria while Mr Haider and his cohorts hold sway. This imperative is both a personal and collective responsibility. It is a question of principle.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The ascent to power in Austria last week of J\u00f6rg Haider's Freedom party poses a fundamental challenge to European society. It is, as the Portuguese prime minister, Antonio Guterres, said, \"a question of principles and values\". Portugal, which currently holds the European Union presidency, has been at the forefront of opposition to the Haider ascendancy, having realised that the shabby deal in Vienna between the two losers of last October's elections, Wolfgang Sch\u00fcssel's conservative People's party and Mr Haider's far-right movement, has a significance reaching way beyond Austria. The deal will give a boost to extreme rightwing groups in other European countries. It potentially threatens the identity and cohesion of the EU and of other pan-European institutions that arose from the ashes of Europe's fascist era. Mr Haider's mendacious repackaging of the old agenda of hate, racism and fear challenges every individual, too, to say clearly what he or she believes, and to act on it. For if we accept the possibility of human progress, then we must accept and draw on the lessons of the past. There can be no prevarication, no fudging, no blas\u00e9, comforting pretence that the threat is overstated and will soon recede. Nor can there be any accommodation. We should all know where that historically leads. For Mr Haider, emboldened by his success, makes no secret of the fact that he hopes to take the chancellorship outright next time around. In this context the swift decision of 14 EU member governments to quarantine the 15th, Austria, is welcome. This is not a case of bullying by Brussels. The d\u00e9marche was undertaken without prior reference to Romano Prodi or his European Commission. Nor is it a right-left issue, or in any sense an ideological battle, for no party holds exclusive rights to bigotry. The criticism that is raining down on the wretched Mr Sch\u00fcssel - whose ambition to become chancellor overwhelmed his responsibility to his country - comes from democrats of all persuasions, appalled by a grotesque distortion of the people's will. It is a great shame that the Freedom party's 27% share of the vote has translated into half the government posts. It is a great pity that Viktor Klima, leader of the largest party, the Social Democrats, which belatedly called for fresh elections, failed to show more nous. It is chilling that after all that has passed since Anschluss, so many Austrians, ignoring history, appear to prefer a smug, revisionist chauvinism that can find a senior role in its political system for a man who admires Hitler's employment policies and praises former SS officers. The assertion that external, anti-Haider pressure constitutes a gross interference in Austria's internal affairs does not bear scrutiny. For Austria does not somehow inhabit a moral universe all its own. \"It is an expression that we stand for a Europe based on shared values [that] Mr Haider has constantly violated,\" said Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, Germany's chancellor. His foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, added: \"The EU cannot accept that xenophobia and rightwing extremism become part of government.\" Italy's prime minister, Massimo D'Alema, said simply: \"Europe has certain criteria and values that unite it.\" It was plain that, in the end, outsiders could not dictate to Austria the composition of its government. But it remains equally plain that as a member of the Western democratic community of nations as much as the EU itself, Austria, like a wayward child, had to be left in no doubt what the consequences of its actions would be. Now those warnings have been effectively ignored, and the deserved isolation and ostracism of Austria will begin. Mr Sch\u00fcssel protests that Austria is not a pariah state. He is wrong. Despite Mr Haider's grandiose, unbelievable last-minute pledges to clean up his act, there should be no wavering. For individuals, companies and governments that would uphold the values of a free society, there must be no business-as-usual with Austria while Mr Haider and his cohorts hold sway. This imperative is both a personal and collective responsibility. It is a question of principle.",

      "bodyText": "The Stansted hijack crisis ended peacefully today when the armed hijackers gave themselves up after releasing all their hostages unharmed. Essex police assistant chief constable Joe Edwards announced that Britain's longest hijack was over shortly after 6am - more than three days after the Afghan airliner landed at the airport. \"The hijack is now at an end,\" he said, after a second wave of 65 passengers were freed by the gunmen. Mr Edwards said: \"Within the last few minutes we removed the last people off the hijacked aeroplane. \"We are checking to make sure the plane truly is empty, but I believe the hijackers have now surrendered. About 65 people have just left in the second phase.\" The final phase began shortly before 6am when a second wave of passengers began leaving the jet. Many of the 65 hostages approached waiting police with their hands in the air before they were guided to a safe area of the airfield. Their appearance followed an earlier release, shortly after 3am, when 85 men, women and children walked down the rear steps of the Ariana jet, which was hijacked during an internal flight on Sunday. The first release came minutes after two hijackers had left the Boeing 727 to hold a face-to-face meeting with negotiators. The passengers were taken from the concrete apron of the Essex airfield by bus to an undisclosed destination for medical checks. Police have established a reception centre at a nearby hotel and Red Cross officials arrived yesterday with games, books and soft toys for the 23 children who left their homes in Afghanistan on Sunday. Immigration officials were said to believe that most of the travellers would be seeking to stay in Britain. At least three of those already released by the hijackers are understood to have applied for political asylum. And there was a deepening suspicion that the events of the past five days might have been part of a plan to enable the hijackers and their families to escape from the fundamentalist Taliban regime ruling Afghanistan. Reports from Kabul of links between the passengers and hijackers - including suggestions that 40 of them were from the same family - increased speculation that the whole incident was an organised bid for political asylum. Asked about the reports, Mr Edwards said: \"I think that may be simplifying a more complex situation.\" His colleague, assistant chief constable John Broughton, indicated that the hostage gang would be charged. \"We are now into a very complex and involved criminal investigation,\" he said. \"What we now want is to put together all the pieces that we can, ultimately so that we can bring this matter into the criminal jurisdiction.\" Home secretary Jack Straw welcomed the conclusion of the hijacking. \"I am naturally relieved that the hijacking incident at Stansted airport has been peacefully resolved without loss of life or serious injury,\" he said. \"We owe a great debt of gratitude to Essex police...

The answer? Fur. Lots of it. Wasn't Puffy worried that the star sensibilities in the audience last weekend might bridle at his parade of skins? Unlikely: a good few rabbits had gone into Missy Elliot's soft fur coat and Lil Kim was trailing fur sleeves and matching fur-trimmed culottes all over the seat. </p> <p>The history of the fur trade can be told through the bumper stickers it has inspired. \"Fight, fight, fight, forever more\" versus \"compassion is the fashion\". \"Support the fur farmers\" versus \"Jesus was a vegetarian\". This is not a history of man against raccoon or rock against furrier's window. It is a history of information. As mink makes a stunning appearance on the catwalks of New York this week, campaigners on both sides of the fur war are reaching for their volumes of statistics, to prove how healthy/ animal trapped the industry is. </p> <p>\"I can't emphasise how important it is that more and more designers are using fur,\" says Jan Brown of the British Fur Trade Association. \"In the 1999 collections, 220 designers were using fur, five times more than in 1985 when records started. We are expecting that figure to rise to 400 for the 2000 collections.\" There's more. \"Over the past few years there has been a rise in the value of fur of roughly \u00a37m. Mink prices have risen by 15% in Copenhagen. In 1993 production of mink pelts was at 2.6m. In 1998 that had risen to 28.6m.\" According to the fur industry, since French Elle declared \"it's OK to wear fur again\" in 1995, the line on the profits graph has soared. </p> <p>That's the view from the red corner. In the white corner, activists at Peta, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, are brandishing some rather different figures. \"World mink production has dropped by 10%,\" says Andrew Butler, the group's spokesman. \"Evans Inc, the economic barometer of the United States fur industry, recorded a net loss of $1.7m for its third quarter last year.\" There are no definitive statistics for world sales of fur - the industry is too canny to release them - and so the battle of fudged figures and partial truths rages indefinitely. </p> <p>Evidence from the New York shows this week supports Jan Brown's figures. For those accustomed to British sensitivity on the subject, the volume of fur in evidence is quite a shock. Puffy, Oscar de la Renta, Marc Jacobs, Tommy Hilfiger, Bottega Veneta and Carolina Herrera are just some of the designers who have sent fur down the catwalk already this week. Mary J Blige was last seen running from show to show in a pale blue fur coat with dear little rabbit claws dangling off the collar. A few years ago, British models could be relied upon to avoid fur - this week, they have been prancing down catwalks happily bedecked in the stuff. At Carolina Herrera, where even the black skinny-rib jumpers came trimmed with thick mink cuffs, Karen Elson wore a brown-and-white striped mink blouson jacket, while at Marc Jacobs, Erin O'Connor, winner of Model of the Year at 1999's Elle Style Awards, sported a fluffy collar of Tuscan lamb. </p> <p>The question posed by this is two-fold: how far does catwalk fashion influence high-street buying when there are lingering ethical issues involved and, how far did fur go out of fashion in the first place? The second question is easier to answer. The impact that anti-fur campaigners had on the industry in the early 90s was undeniably severe. Who can forget Belinda Carlisle and her backing singers posing starkers behind a banner that read \"we'd rather go-go naked than wear fur\", or David Bailey's advert for Lynx, showing a model spattered with blood as she minced her way down the catwalk in a fur coat. \"In the late 80s, fur sales plummeted by 50%,\" says Andrew Butler at Peta. \"You couldn't wear fur in Britain in the early 90s,\" says Caroline Cox, head of cultural and historical studies at the London College of Fashion. \"In London, there used to be massive refrigerators in department stores to keep the fur coats in. Between Queensway and Westbourne Grove you can still see the building where people used to pay to store their fur coats. It is now \u00a3350,000 flats. That world has completely disappeared.\" </p> <p>The reasons why this world has disappeared, is vital to the question of whether it is possible for it to re-emerge. Cox is sceptical about the motivations that drove the popular fur boycott, suspecting fashion had more to do with it than principle. \"You had the whole green, new age scene starting up, which turned out to be a fashion-oriented movement. You had people like Ozbeck putting out his White Collection in 1990, which introduced recycled clothing into the mainstream. Not wearing fur was not an entirely deep and meaningful statement.\" In Ozbeck's White Collection, all the garments were white, a symbolic attempt to illustrate the face of ethical clothing. It self-detonated slightly when someone pointed out that cotton is a cash crop which ruins developing countries and ethical consumers had to look for something else to appropriate. \"In fashion it is impossible to be ethical,\" says Cox. \"So people did it symbolically by renouncing fur. It was a fashionable statement, so of course it has become unfashionable and fur is starting to reappear.\" </p> <p>There is an argument being made that it never disappeared entirely, at least, not in cold countries or on the catwalks. \"European women have always worn fur,\" says Cox. \"In Paris and Milan. In Russia, every single person in the winter wears a fur hat. We are lucky to be able to renounce fur because of central heating.\" Even Peta is willing to concede that its efforts did not close down the industry entirely. \"A lot of dinosaur designers like Oscar de la Renta and Karl Lagerfeld kept right on going,\" says Butler. \"There have always been a handful of selfish designers who continue to work in fur.\" </p> <p>The question of how much impact young designers who are now joining the \"dinosaurs\" will have on high-street sales, is unclear. Certainly in New York's still snow-piled streets this week, fur coats and hats are as common as Gap fleeces in London. The message is clear: if you want to stay warm and chic in the freezing New York winter, fur is where it's at. Rappers, society ladies and the average Joe in New York are swathed in it. In fact, the lust for luxury fabrics at high-street prices has been fashion's biggest story over the past two years and has made the return of fur almost inevitable. The renaissance of traditional Milanese fashion houses such as Fendi, whose heritage is steeped in the fur and leather trade, has swamped the high-end stores and magazines with fur. Traditionally, high-end fabrics have become so ubiquitous on the high street - cashmere in New Look, leather in Top Shop, pashminas in Marks &amp; Spencer - that those wishing to stay one step ahead of the pack have moved on to Fendi's fox-fur bags and Gucci's lizardskin shoes. </p> <p>Animal skins have crept back into our wardrobes too: the craze for animal-inspired prints and \"harmless\" animal-related trims such as feathers, paved the way for the real thing. Last season, Prada experimented with ostrich feathers; this season, it's using the bird's skins and no one is batting an eyelid. \"When Sophie Wessex wore the fur hat it was a media shock horror story, but I don't think the public were bothered about it at all,\" says Cox, who sees a connection between the rise in the pro-fox hunting, countryside lobby and the possible revival of fur wearing. \"The rural alliance has brought together all these ghastly old tories and wearing fur is now almost an anti-Blair statement.\" </p> <p>It is getting easier for wool- wearing liberals to buy fur too now, since developments in the treatment of newly harvested fur have allowed the pelts to be manipulated to remind you as little of the animal they were stripped from as possible. </p> <p>\"It is so much easier for designers to use now,\" says Jan Brown at the British Fur Trade Association. \"You can dye mink and sheer it so that you can use both sides and it looks like velvet.\" </p> <p>Fur manufacturers have learned to bypass customer squeamishness by creating blended fabrics that use fur for cachet and texture while delicately avoiding the issue of animal suffering. Saga Furs of Scandinavia, the largest fur marketing association in the world, says that demand for mink shearling, the soft leather underside of the mink, has never been higher. Tommy Hilfiger and Michael Kors have both used mink shearling in their autumn/winter collections. </p> <p>Reversible fox, which has a nappa finish on the leather and so can be worn on either side, is expected to feature tomorrow on the catwalk of designer Vera Wang, principally known in the UK as the woman who designed Posh Spice's wedding dress. And fellow American label Halston is expected to integrate knitted fox, woven from a yarn that is 70% blue fox hair spun with thread, into the collection. </p> <p>But popular polls continue to show support for the anti-fur movement. In 1998 the RSPCA found 84% of poll respondents were against using fur. The year before, 70% in a GMTV poll voted against it and 91% in a Cosmopolitan magazine survey. The fur farming prohibition bill has gone through its second reading in the House of Commons and is now at committee stage. Even the fashion world is not entirely convinced by the rehabilitation of fur-wearing. Up-and-coming New York designer Katayone Adeli admitted that she had intended to use fur in the collection she is showing this week, but when she saw the pelts, they turned her stomach. She used fake fur instead. Most people still recoil when faced with upfront evidence of the horrific origins of this fabric: when John Galliano put a fox's head on a garment, the picture made newspapers worldwide, despite the fact that fox fur is now a fairly common fabric on the catwalk. </p> <p>Still, it isn't the popular cause it once was. A decade ago, it seemed likely that fur would disappear along with an older generation of society ladies. But far from being limited to Upper East Side stalwarts like Herrera and de la Renta, fur is being adopted by a generation of designers who were barely out of college in the days when those wearing mink risked being doused in red paint: Marc Jacobs, current fashion wunderkind, and Bottega Veneta, new darling of the smart young New York set, both showed fur this week. The only thing animal welfare campaigners can take heart from is the fickleness of the industry: perhaps next season, it will be fashionable to care again.</p>",

Three judges, including the lord chief justice, Lord Bingham, ruled his two murder convictions safe. The jury, reduced to 11 through illness, found him guilty unanimously on the first charge and by an 10-1 majority on the second. Sawoniuk, 78, from south-east London, who claimed his Old Bailey trial last April was an \"abuse of the process of the court\", was present in the dock as the decision was announced. He denied murdering Jews in his hometown of Domachevo, Belarus, 57 years ago while serving in a local police force controlled by the Germans. His counsel, William Clegg QC, had told the appeal judges that the trial judge, Mr Justice Potts, \"erred in law\" on a number of issues. He said the judge erred in law in failing to stay the two murder counts on the ground \"that the continued prosecution of the appellant amounted to an abuse of the process of the court\". Mr Clegg said there had been a \"delay that was unprecedented in the history of our criminal courts of 50-something years between offence and trial\". \"We submit that no fair trial is possible after 57 years,\" he said.

Mr Portillo wants to establish a parliamentary committee dedicated to scrutinising the MPC (it is currently done by the Treasury select committee), increasingly accountability and holding the power to scrutinise and confirm committee appointments. Why did Gordon Brown give up his own power to set rates? Many observers were amazed that, after an 18-year battle to get its hands on the levers of economic power, Labour threw away the most important one within days of coming to government. But as Labour pledged in its manifesto, it desired economic stability, creating the correct conditions for economic growth, above all else. Taking the politics out of deciding interest rates could help avert a future cycle of boom-and-bust. Politicians are wedded to electoral cycles and getting re-elected. Often political needs clash with the best interests of the economy. A government may want to stoke the feelgood factor or wow voters with generously low mortgage rates just before an election, when the economy requires a healthy dose of deflation. The disastrous aftermath of Black Wednesday, when Norman Lamont was humiliatingly forced to withdraw from the ERM in 1992, and the 1980s boom, stoked by Chancellor Nigel Lawson's inflationary policies, added to the impression that politicians were not to be trusted with interest rate decisions. What do critics of the Bank argue? There is an economic argument and a political argument against the existence of the MPC.

      "body": "<p>You've overdone it, haven't you? That new year's resolution to take more exercise seemed like such a good idea. For a few weeks you managed to keep going, and you saw the turkey fat begin to melt from your waistline. </p> <p>Then your ankles swelled, your ligaments tore, your shoulder gave out, your tennis elbow returned, your knee popped or - as happened to me -your shins splintered. Well that's what it felt like. Walking upstairs became agony, walking down again was worse. I have developed a bandy gait in order to try and keep the weight off my calves. Too much well-intentioned tennis, football and jogging, and now someone seems to be sticking needles through my legs. </p> <p>Friends told me to go to a sports injury clinic or physiotherapist, but either option will surely cost more money than I want to spend (my body is a temple without an offering plate). Maybe an online check-up, for the price of a local phone call, would be a sensible first option? </p> <p>I started at <a href=\"http://www.medisport.co.uk\">Medisport</a>. It couldn't be simpler: you click where it hurts. Each area of the site's body map leads you to description of symptoms and details the possible cause of injury. Then you get advice on managing and treating the problem. They recommend the RICE method - rest, ice, compression and elevation - for managing a low grade injury in its early stages (not that mine is low grade, of course). There are illustrated details of exercises, biological information about what's going on with your body, and advice for helping it heal: vitamin C, surprisingly, is one tonic. </p> <p>At <a href=\"http://www.fitnessfind.com\">www.fitnessfind.com</a> there is a huge array of topics, easily accessible from the opening page: no map, but almost every part of the body seems to be covered, as well as different kinds of sport. It has also collated links to a vast array of articles and information available at other sources. Titbits include how to avoid overtraining, arthritis hazards, excessive sweating, and 101 ways to stay fit when you're injured. </p> <p>At <a href=\"http://www.thriveonline.com\">Thrive online</a> there is a searchable database of injuries and treatments, as well as direct access listings for the more common problems, like decompression illness and twisted testicle. </p> <p>It is, of course, the season for recovering from winter sports injuries. If the slopes have knocked you about, try <a href=\"http://www.zyworld.com/aviemed\">www.zyworld.com/aviemed</a> These are the web pages of a six-strong medical team based at the foot of the Cairngorms. As well as the obvious ski injury advice, it also has some interesting statistics on the newer dangers of snowboarding. </p> <p>Snowboarders, it seems are almost twice as likely to injure themselves as skiers, and twice as likely to fracture their bones. The typical profile of an injured boarder is (unsurprisingly) a young, inexperienced male. He will no doubt be gratified to learn that he boasts a pattern of typical injuries very different to those incurred by skiers. </p> <p>Some US ski sites offer something extra: tips on suing your fellow skiers when they have knocked you from your feet. James Chalat has a law practice in Colorado that specialise in skier on skier collision cases <a href=\"http://www.skisafety.com\">www.skisafety.com</a>. One client won $2.4m from another fumbling skier. Be warned: skiing in the US might hurt your wallet even more than your body. </p> <p>Of course, you may have opted to start the year with a safe, impact-free sport, such as swimming, and then been shocked by the onset of \"swimmers ear\". </p> <p>Help is at hand at <a href=\"http://www.sinuscare.com\">www.sinuscare.com</a>, where you can learn how to combat the fungi and bacteria that can cause infections in the ear canal. </p> <p>There is advice on making your own eardrops with rubbing alcohol as the base. It also tells you about larger biological hazards: of the many types of insects that can get into the ears - gnats, moths, and cockroaches are apparently the most common. Gnats need special attention: they get tangled in the wax and cannot fly out. </p> <p>One thing I failed to find was a directory of UK sports injury clinics willing to take away my money and my pain. <a href=\"http://www.nmsi.org.uk\">The National Sports Medicine Institute of the United Kingdom</a> has a site, but with little useful information. It does at least give a telephone number, which would help those needing to find local care. </p> <p>My particular torment, it seems, is caused by shin splints. On the web I have found sound advice: rest (can do, no problem), and a series of exercises to help prevent a recurrence when I start training again. </p> <p>I plan to start the exercises as soon as I've per fected my resting technique. After all, I should heed the advice given at <a href=\"http://www.drugbase.co.za\">www.drugbase.co.za</a> </p> <p> \"Common sense, and the self-discipline of knowing when to stop, or when not to start, a session of physical activity are two essential factors in avoiding any kind of injury.\" I'm sure they're right. I should find the self-discipline to be able to listen to what my body is saying. Pass the peanuts.</p>",

      "bodyText": "You've overdone it, haven't you? That new year's resolution to take more exercise seemed like such a good idea. For a few weeks you managed to keep going, and you saw the turkey fat begin to melt from your waistline. Then your ankles swelled, your ligaments tore, your shoulder gave out, your tennis elbow returned, your knee popped or - as happened to me -your shins splintered. Well that's what it felt like. Walking upstairs became agony, walking down again was worse. I have developed a bandy gait in order to try and keep the weight off my calves. Too much well-intentioned tennis, football and jogging, and now someone seems to be sticking needles through my legs. Friends told me to go to a sports injury clinic or physiotherapist, but either option will surely cost more money than I want to spend (my body is a temple without an offering plate). Maybe an online check-up, for the price of a local phone call, would be a sensible first option? I started at Medisport. It couldn't be simpler: you click where it hurts. Each area of the site's body map leads you to description of symptoms and details the possible cause of injury. Then you get advice on managing and treating the problem. They recommend the RICE method - rest, ice, compression and elevation - for managing a low grade injury in its early stages (not that mine is low grade, of course). There are illustrated details of exercises, biological information about what's going on with your body, and advice for helping it heal: vitamin C, surprisingly, is one tonic. At www.fitnessfind.com there is a huge array of topics, easily accessible from the opening page: no map, but almost every part of the body seems to be covered, as well as different kinds of sport. It has also collated links to a vast array of articles and information available at other sources. Titbits include how to avoid overtraining, arthritis hazards, excessive sweating, and 101 ways to stay fit when you're injured. At Thrive online there is a searchable database of injuries and treatments, as well as direct access listings for the more common problems, like decompression illness and twisted testicle. It is, of course, the season for recovering from winter sports injuries. If the slopes have knocked you about, try www.zyworld.com/aviemed These are the web pages of a six-strong medical team based at the foot of the Cairngorms. As well as the obvious ski injury advice, it also has some interesting statistics on the newer dangers of snowboarding. Snowboarders, it seems are almost twice as likely to injure themselves as skiers, and twice as likely to fracture their bones. The typical profile of an injured boarder is (unsurprisingly) a young, inexperienced male. He will no doubt be gratified to learn that he boasts a pattern of typical injuries very different to those incurred by skiers. Some US ski sites offer something extra: tips on suing your fellow skiers when they have knocked you from your feet. James Chalat has a law practice in Colorado that specialise in skier on skier collision cases www.skisafety.com. One client won $2.4m from another fumbling skier. Be warned: skiing in the US might hurt your wallet even more than your body. Of course, you may have opted to start the year with a safe, impact-free sport, such as swimming, and then been shocked by the onset of \"swimmers ear\". Help is at hand at www.sinuscare.com, where you can learn how to combat the fungi and bacteria that can cause infections in the ear canal. There is advice on making your own eardrops with rubbing alcohol as the base. It also tells you about larger biological hazards: of the many types of insects that can get into the ears - gnats, moths, and cockroaches are apparently the most common. Gnats need special attention: they get tangled in the wax and cannot fly out. One thing I failed to find was a directory of UK sports injury clinics willing to take away my money and my pain. The National Sports Medicine Institute of the United Kingdom has a site, but with little useful information. It does at least give a telephone number, which would help those needing to find local care. My particular torment, it seems, is caused by shin splints. On the web I have found sound advice: rest (can do, no problem), and a series of exercises to help prevent a recurrence when I start training again. I plan to start the exercises as soon as I've per fected my resting technique. After all, I should heed the advice given at www.drugbase.co.za \"Common sense, and the self-discipline of knowing when to stop, or when not to start, a session of physical activity are two essential factors in avoiding any kind of injury.\" I'm sure they're right. I should find the self-discipline to be able to listen to what my body is saying. Pass the peanuts.",

Geoffrey Ernest Maurice de Ste Croix, historian, born February 8 1910, died February 5 2000",

And the prize, as usual, is literary greatness - entry to the 20th-century pantheon alongside the likes of Hemingway and Steinbeck. </p> <p>Wolfe, having worked his way through the ranks of journalism, has staked his claim in the last two decades of the millennium with two blockbuster epics. The first, Bonfire of the Vanities, took on class and race struggle between Wall Street and the Bronx. His long-awaited second tome, A Man in Full, which came out in 1998 after a 17-year pause, did the same for the South. </p> <p>The public loved both books and has bought well over a million hardback copies of A Man in Full, which narrates the fall from grace of an Atlanta property developer, Charlie Croker. But is it art? And more to the point, is it that Holy Grail of US literature: \"The Great American Novel\"? </p> <p>The concerted response to both questions has been a contemptuous \"no\" from Updike, Mailer and Irving, hitherto the leading lions in the literate-but-accessible category. They say they are defending literary standards, but their defence has been down and dirty. </p> <p>John Irving, at 57 the dauphin of the trio, was by far the most brutal. Of Wolfe's efforts, he said: \"It's like reading a bad newspaper or a bad piece in a magazine. It makes you wince.\" The author of The World According to Garp added that on any page of a Wolfe novel, he could \"read a sentence that would make me gag\". </p> <p>John Updike in his New Yorker review went in for the kill. \"A Man in Full,\" he imperiously concluded, \"still amounts to entertainment, not literature, even literature in a modest aspirant form.\" </p> <p>Norman Mailer, writing in the New York Review of Books, compared reading the weighty Wolfe novel to making love to a 300lb woman: \"Once she gets on top it's all over. Fall in love or be asphyxiated.\" </p> <p>The message has been blunt and clear: Wolfe may sell a lot of books but he belongs on the airport shelves alongside Stephen King and all those self-improvement manuals, not in the hallowed hall of the greats. </p> <p>Wolfe, however, is not the sort to turn the other cheek and slink back to his keyboard. He has instead launched a one-man verbal onslaught against his detractors, flinging entrenched reputations aside with a ferocity that has scandalised even the jaded and scarred New York book world. </p> <p>\"It's a tantrum. It's a wonderful tantrum,\" he said on the same talk show that Irving used to attack him. \"A Man in Full panicked [Irving] the same way it frightened John Updike and Norman. Frightened them. Panicked them.\" </p> <p>He described Updike and Mailer as \"two old piles of bones\". As for the youngest of his three opponents, he points out: \"Irving is a great admirer of Dickens. But what writer does he see now constantly compared to Dickens. Not John Irving, but Tom Wolfe . . . it must gnaw at him terribly.\" </p> <p>The feud has evidently drawn blood all round, but it is still only in its early rounds. Wolfe has a score-settling essay in the pipeline, called The Three Stooges (no prizes for guessing who). It will be published later this year in a collection of short pieces, Hooking Up, which will also include a side-swipe at an old enemy: the New Yorker, which Wolfe views as the kingpin of a literary establishment which has tried for so long to keep him out in the cold. </p> <p>The Wolfe-Mailer feud is by far the oldest and cattiest of the three. As far back as 1989, Mailer remarked: \"In my mind, there is something silly about a man who wears a white suit all the time, especially in New York.\" </p> <p>Wolfe brushed off the sartorial attack, simply pointing out that \"the lead dog is the one they always try to bite in the ass\". To which Mailer quickly responded: \"It doesn't mean you're the top dog just because your ass is bleeding.\" </p> <p>Deep below the multiple layers of bitchiness, it is possible to pick out a substantive battle over the future of American novel. The line followed by Updike, Mailer and Irving is that there is a qualitative leap from journalism to literature which Wolfe has tried but failed to complete. </p> <p>Updike puts the argument most clearly in his New Yorker deconstruction of A Man in Full: \"So much local information, so many well-lighted settings, so much news do not quite knit into a novel powered by the human spirit as it gropes and struggles for focus. Wolfe has perhaps too many opinions for a novelist: his characters have a hard time breaking out of the illustrative mold in which they are cast.\" </p> <p>Wolfe does not disown his past as a hack. Instead, he claims to have transformed his former trade into something higher - New Journalism, a breathless running-commentary narrative style he pioneered in books like The Right Stuff about the early astronauts. It is a style which has left its mark on a generation of magazine writers. </p> <p>Now Wolfe is arguing that the New Literature should grow out of the New Journalism, embracing \"full-blooded realism\". </p> <p>\"In abandoning social realism, novelists also abandoned certain vital matters of technique. As a result, by 1969 it was obvious that . . . magazine writers - the very lumpen proles themselves! - had also gained a technical edge on novelists. It was marvellous,\" Wolfe wrote. </p> <p>Wolfe's literary enemies, the feisty novelist insists, are being left behind by his march on realism. \"All three have seen the writing on the wall,\" he said, \"and it reads: A Man in Full.\" </p> <p>It is bitter dispute, spattered with the bile of old men with one eye on their rivals and the other on posterity. With the exception of Irving, all of them are in the late evening of their lives and can see the end coming. They are clearly in a rush, anxious to land a few last blows before the question of greatness is taken out of their hands for good.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>Has a team following-on ever won a Test? </strong> asks Dave Kennealy</p> <p>It has been done twice - both times by England! The only occasion in the 20th century was the famous match at Headingley in 1981, when Ian Botham turned the match on its head with a rollicking 149 not out after England, following on, had been 135 for 7, still 92 behind Australia. Botham's heroics lifted England to 356, a lead of 129. Bob Willis, with 8 for 43, then bowled Australia out for 111 and England had won by 18 runs. The other time was in 1894-95, when England (325 and 437) came from behind to beat Australia (586 and 166) by ten runs after following on at Sydney.</p> <p> <strong>In the famous \"underarm\" incident, who were the two batsmen at the time? And when Richard Hadlee took 9 for 56 against Australia, who took the other wicket?</strong> asks Dave Arthur</p> <p>The batsmen at the end of that Australia-New Zealand one-day international, which was played at Melbourne in Feb 1981, were Brian McKechnie (0*) and opener Bruce Edgar (102*). It was McKechnie who faced the notorious underarm delivery, bowled by Trevor Chappell on the orders of his brother Greg (his other brother, Ian, criticised the action from the TV commentary box). New Zealand had needed six off the last ball to tie the match, and McKechnie threw his bat to the floor in disgust.</p> <p>The bowler who spoiled Hadlee's chances of taking all ten wickets at Brisbane in 1985-86 was offspinner Vaughan Brown. He couldn't keep Hadlee out of the limelight though: it was him who took a tricky catch to send back Australia's Geoff Lawson and give Brown what turned out to be his only Test wicket.</p> <p> <strong>Apart from Jim Laker, has any other bowler taken ten wickets in a Test innings?</strong> asks Derek Tempest</p> <p>Yes, but it was more than 42 years and 1000 Tests later. Anil Kumble, the Indian legspinner, took 10 for 74 against Pakistan at Delhi in 1998-99. Amazingly, Richard Stokes, an Englishman who had been taken to watch Laker's match as a schoolboy in 1956, was there in the crowd to see Kumble repeat the feat.</p> <p><strong>Who is the only British Prime Minister to have played first-class cricket?</strong> asks Natalie Pepper</p> <p>This was Sir Alec Douglas-Home, later Lord Home, who was Britain's Prime Minister in 1963-64. Earlier, as Lord Dunglass, he had played a few games for Middlesex. He was a fast-medium bowler - Gubby Allen, a captain of England, thought him \"decidedly useful\" - who took 12 first-class wickets in all. He also toured South America with a non-Test-playing MCC team in 1926-27.</p> <p> <strong>Can you tell me who played international cricket for both England and South Africa?</strong> asks Tony Munday</p> <p> There have been two men who played for both sides: Fred Hearne and Frank Mitchell. Hearne played two Tests for England in South Africa in 1888-89, and then settled there: he then played four Tests for South Africa. Two of his brothers and his son also played Test cricket. Mitchell appeared twice for England in South Africa in 1898-99, the switched sides and played three more Tests for South Africa. He captained SA's team for the Triangular Tournament in England in 1912.</p> <p> <strong>While watching the last day of the fourth Test between South Africa and England at Cape Town, I was confused by an umpiring decision. What is the difference between bat-pad and pad-bat, and which can be given out caught or lbw?</strong> asks Joel Bregman</p> <p>They are technical descriptions to indicate whether the ball hit the bat or the pad first before going on to strike the other one. You can't be given out lbw if the ball hits the bat first (or at least you shouldn't!) but you can be given out caught if the ball hits the pad first, as long as it hits the bat (or the glove holding it) as well.</p> <p> <strong>I enjoyed England's tour of Australia in 1998-99, when I attended both the Melbourne and Sydney Tests. When is England's next tour Down Under, and when will the Test dates be announced?</strong> asks Michael Parkinson (no, not that one)</p> <p> England's next tour of Australia is scheduled for the winter of 2002-03. Precise dates should be released early in 2002, but the likelihood is that the Melbourne Test will be played over the Christmas period and the Sydney one shortly after the New Year, as these have become traditional dates in the Australian sporting calendar.</p> <p> <strong>Apparently a relative of mine was quite a famous cricketer. Can you tell me anything about him?</strong> asks Paula Pretlove</p> <p>The only person of that name to have played first-class cricket in England is John Frederick Pretlove, who was born in 1932. He appeared first for Cambridge University (1954-56), then played for Kent until 1959. He was a left-hand batsman who scored ten first-class centuries in all. He was also a useful football and fives player, and more recently was Kent CCC's president. If you want to try to find out whether he is a relative you could try to contact him by contacting Kent's chief executive at paul.millman.kent@ecb.co.uk</p> <p><em>Steven Lynch is managing editor of Wisden Cricket Monthly</em> </p> <p>Please note: only a selection of questions can be answered each week, and individual correspondence can only occasionally be entered into</p>",

Botham's heroics lifted England to 356, a lead of 129. Bob Willis, with 8 for 43, then bowled Australia out for 111 and England had won by 18 runs. The other time was in 1894-95, when England (325 and 437) came from behind to beat Australia (586 and 166) by ten runs after following on at Sydney. In the famous \"underarm\" incident, who were the two batsmen at the time? And when Richard Hadlee took 9 for 56 against Australia, who took the other wicket? asks Dave Arthur The batsmen at the end of that Australia-New Zealand one-day international, which was played at Melbourne in Feb 1981, were Brian McKechnie (0*) and opener Bruce Edgar (102*). It was McKechnie who faced the notorious underarm delivery, bowled by Trevor Chappell on the orders of his brother Greg (his other brother, Ian, criticised the action from the TV commentary box). New Zealand had needed six off the last ball to tie the match, and McKechnie threw his bat to the floor in disgust. The bowler who spoiled Hadlee's chances of taking all ten wickets at Brisbane in 1985-86 was offspinner Vaughan Brown. He couldn't keep Hadlee out of the limelight though: it was him who took a tricky catch to send back Australia's Geoff Lawson and give Brown what turned out to be his only Test wicket. Apart from Jim Laker, has any other bowler taken ten wickets in a Test innings? asks Derek Tempest Yes, but it was more than 42 years and 1000 Tests later. Anil Kumble, the Indian legspinner, took 10 for 74 against Pakistan at Delhi in 1998-99. Amazingly, Richard Stokes, an Englishman who had been taken to watch Laker's match as a schoolboy in 1956, was there in the crowd to see Kumble repeat the feat. Who is the only British Prime Minister to have played first-class cricket? asks Natalie Pepper This was Sir Alec Douglas-Home, later Lord Home, who was Britain's Prime Minister in 1963-64. Earlier, as Lord Dunglass, he had played a few games for Middlesex. He was a fast-medium bowler - Gubby Allen, a captain of England, thought him \"decidedly useful\" - who took 12 first-class wickets in all. He also toured South America with a non-Test-playing MCC team in 1926-27. Can you tell me who played international cricket for both England and South Africa? asks Tony Munday There have been two men who played for both sides: Fred Hearne and Frank Mitchell. Hearne played two Tests for England in South Africa in 1888-89, and then settled there: he then played four Tests for South Africa. Two of his brothers and his son also played Test cricket. Mitchell appeared twice for England in South Africa in 1898-99, the switched sides and played three more Tests for South Africa. He captained SA's team for the Triangular Tournament in England in 1912. While watching the last day of the fourth Test between South Africa and England at Cape Town, I was confused by an umpiring decision. What is the difference between bat-pad and pad-bat, and which can be given out caught or lbw? asks Joel Bregman They are technical descriptions to indicate whether the ball hit the bat or the pad first before going on to strike the other one. You can't be given out lbw if the ball hits the bat first (or at least you shouldn't!) but you can be given out caught if the ball hits the pad first, as long as it hits the bat (or the glove holding it) as well. I enjoyed England's tour of Australia in 1998-99, when I attended both the Melbourne and Sydney Tests. When is England's next tour Down Under, and when will the Test dates be announced? asks Michael Parkinson (no, not that one) England's next tour of Australia is scheduled for the winter of 2002-03. Precise dates should be released early in 2002, but the likelihood is that the Melbourne Test will be played over the Christmas period and the Sydney one shortly after the New Year, as these have become traditional dates in the Australian sporting calendar. Apparently a relative of mine was quite a famous cricketer. Can you tell me anything about him? asks Paula Pretlove The only person of that name to have played first-class cricket in England is John Frederick Pretlove, who was born in 1932. He appeared first for Cambridge University (1954-56), then played for Kent until 1959. He was a left-hand batsman who scored ten first-class centuries in all. He was also a useful football and fives player, and more recently was Kent CCC's president. If you want to try to find out whether he is a relative you could try to contact him by contacting Kent's chief executive at paul.millman.kent@ecb.co.uk Steven Lynch is managing editor of Wisden Cricket Monthly Please note: only a selection of questions can be answered each week, and individual correspondence can only occasionally be entered into",

The hijackers' weapons are believed to have been smug gled aboard the plane by female passengers who concealed them under the voluminous burqas - full-length cloaks - that Taliban regulations force women to wear. Taliban authorities yesterday arrested at least four workers at Kabul airport for helping, or allowing, the hijackers to take weapons on to the plane. It was unclear whether they had been arrested for merely failing to ensure security or whether they were alleged to be complicit in the hijack. They included officials of Ariana and female workers from the security department at the airport. Credence was added to the asylum theory by the presence at Stansted of Hope Hanlan, the British representative of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees. Her role is to give a view on asylum applications. As the hijack approached its fourth day at Stansted, negotiations between police and the hijackers stabilised after a short burst of panic among the hijackers in the early hours of the morning when four crew members, including the pilot, escaped through the cockpit window. Negotiators feared the hijackers, who are armed with hand guns, could start shooting passengers. It is understood threats were made. Police, who described the chaos that followed as the lowest point in the hijack, said the situation had \"changed for the better\" yesterday. Assistant chief constable Joe Edwards said: \"The escape of the flight crew clearly upset people on board the aircraft and altered the very calm nature of the negotiations that have taken place.

There was a nod from the authorities that the hijackers, though described as armed and dangerous, were relatively amateurish and not representatives of a hardline Islamic faction. A UNHCR spokesman said the police had \"not formally requested asylum but if the issue comes up, they would seek our help.\" Ms Hanlan, who was phoned at 3am on Tuesday with a request to help, will provide expert opinion on human rights in Afghanistan to help British authorities judge asylum claims. In a 1996 hijack of a Sudanese plane, successfully negotiated by police at Stansted, the then UNHCR representative, Philippe Lavanchy, was called in. The six Iraqi men involved in the hijack received jail terms but were cleared two years later on appeal and are living in London waiting a decision on their asylum applications. Afghanistan is one of the top sources of asylum seekers coming to Britain, with refugee status being granted in about a third of cases. An average of 360 applications a month have been lodged in the UK by Afghans since October.

By the time the hijackers broke off talks at 4am to get some rest, an uneasy peace had been restored. At 6am, when contact was resumed, talk returned to \"housekeeping\" matters such as refuelling the generators and bringing food on board. When breakfast was deliv ered shortly before 9am two hijackers emerged from the plane for the first time, training guns on two hostages who picked up the food. Shortly after 5pm last night, two figures emerged from the aircraft and carried out what looked like an inspection. Some 151 people remain onboard the plane, including 21 children, nine crew and what police believe to be six to 10 hijackers. It was hoped that the escaped men - the captain, 54, the second captain, 50, a first officer, 53, and a flight engineer, 54, all Afghan nationals - would provide vital information about the hijackers.

In court on Monday, Muvunyi's solicitor said that he denied any involvement in genocide and had tried to prevent killings in the region. After the civil war Muvunyi fled the country. The UN tribunal for Rwanda, set up in the aftermath of the genocide, indicted him last week following pressure by human rights activists.

      "bodyText": "Microsoft faced the prospect of a battle with regulators on both sides of the Atlantic last night after the European commission said it was to investigate the latest version of the software company's operating system, Windows 2000. Mario Monti, the new competition commissioner, said the inquiry followed complaints from users and competitors that the new software would give Microsoft a dominant position in the market. The inquiry comes just seven days before the launch of Windows 2000. Microsoft yesterday pledged to cooperate with the inquiry but insisted it would not derail the launch. Microsoft was informed of the investigation only last week, and was not given any prior warning of the public announcement yesterday. It has four weeks to respond. Mr Monti said information supplied to the commission suggested that Microsoft had designed parts of Windows 2000 in a way \"which will permit it to leverage its dominance in PC operating systems on to other markets\". He said these other markets would include server operating systems and \"ultimately e-commerce\". The investigation throws open the possibility that Microsoft will become embroiled in a long-running and expensive battle with regulators in the same way that it has been drawn into a protracted and damaging dispute with the United States justice department. Microsoft said there might be a connection between the commission's action and the investigation in the US - given that competition officials often shared information and strategy. John Frank, Microsoft's director of European law and corporate affairs, said the common link between the investigations appeared to be \"Sun Microsystems lobbying rather desperately to slow down Windows 2000\". However, the US justice department insisted that it had no prior knowledge about the announcement from Brussels. An official said the American inquiry was still dealing with legal issues and that the next hearing would be held on February 22. Mr Frank said that the company took the European inquiry \"very seriously\", and he was confident that Microsoft could address the commission's concerns. The commission's inquiry is examining whether Microsoft has \"bundled\" its Windows 2000 operating system with other Microsoft products so that its competitors' products are put at a disadvantage. Three years in development, Windows 2000 is designed for business computers and networks and uses a different software architecture to Windows 98, used by householders. Microsoft will reject the allegations by arguing that Windows 2000 can be used in a \"mixed environment\" with, for example, a rival Unix operating system. Mr Frank said that Microsoft products would be \"dead in the water\" if they did not work well in a mixed environment, given that many corporate users require this flexibility. The company was also under an obligation to ensure that its personal computer and server software work well together, given that clients require this compatibility. Mr Monti sought to dampen speculation about the inquiry by noting that it would be \"hugely premature\" to discuss sanctions against Microsoft. But should the allegations be proved Microsoft would be made to change Windows 2000 and could face fines.",

The crazy thing is, the government is making more and more of that exploration illegal.\" The \"hacker ethic\" heralds \"information sharing\" as a \"powerful positive good\". This contrasts, hackers say, with crackers, who tend to gather in tight-knit, secretive groups. Crackers are proud of their sophisticated code-cracking - but they keep quiet about it, unlike the hacking community, who make no secret of their distaste for government regulation of the internet and the lucrative hardware and software businesses run by Microsoft, IBM and others. The current spate of hacking will spur corporate America to close up computer \"back doors\" - the crackers' holy grail that allows them access to a computer system as often they like, even when the security system is enhanced or updated. But as long as America's computer-literate teens can cripple multinational and government websites, the glamour of hacking will continue to lure script kiddies to have a crack at infamy.",

      "bodyText": "New questions were raised last night about the suitability of Pierre-Yves Gerbeau, the Disney executive hired to rescue the crisis-hit Millennium Dome, after fresh discrepancies were discovered in claims that have been made for the 34-year-old Frenchman. Mr Gerbeau was hired at the weekend after the sudden sacking of the chief executive, Jennie Page, who took the blame for what had been seen as a series of public relations disasters that had marred the opening of the centrepiece of the United Kingdom's millennium celebrations. He was brought in after a sequence of mishaps that ruined the opening night, a range of overwhelmingly poor reviews, and the publishing last week of attendance figures for the first month that fell well below expectations. Guardian inquiries raise fresh doubts over claims made in the announcement of Mr Gerbeau's appointment issued by Brunswick public relations for the New Millenium Experience Company. \u0095He was described as \"being promoted five times culminating in his role as vice-president\". Disney annual reports for the time that Mr Gerbeau was employed there do not list him as a vice-president of the park. Inquiries suggest he was employed as one of 40 directors. \u0095He was described as \"working across the entire range of management functions relevant to running a world-class visitor attraction\". In fact Mr Gerbeau was responsible for ticketing, parking, running the attractions and customer relations. He was not responsible for strategy, marketing, pricing, merchandising and public relations - all areas where the dome is seen to be wanting. \u0095He was described as \"heading a team of six directors managing a team of up to 2,000\". Disney sources who worked alongside Mr Gerbeau point out that the company management structure precludes directors being in charge of other directors, although he was relatively senior. \u0095He was described as \"awarded an MBA at Sciences-Po (Paris), achieving top position in his class\". Yesterday the college confirmed this was not true. He came second. \u0095At the time of the announcement he was hailed by dome executives as the \"saviour of Disneyland Paris\". In fact he was not even a member of the \"Challenge 94\" team of troubleshooters who saved the park. Last night one former colleague from Disney, who once promoted Mr Gerbeau, said: \"Make no mistake, PY is a great operator at his own level. But he is out of his depth. I don't want to damage his career, but the truth has to be told.\" Mr Gerbeau worked at Disneyland Paris from 1991. But he left in November 1998 to do an MBA. His mentor at Disneyland was Phillippe Bourguignon, the man who is acutally credited with saving the theme park but who left in 1996 to run Club Med. Mr Gerbeau's MBA focused on the workings of Club Med. Michael Faber, a Tory member of the Commons culture, media and sport committee, which will stage an inquiry later this year, said: \"I have spoken to a number of Gerbeau's former colleagues and clearly there are some unanswered questions about his qualifications, in particular in the areas of marketing and promotion, which are the dome's greatest problems.\"",

As a general rule, evidence of a defendant's misconduct on other occasions or his propensity to behaviour of a certain type cannot be put before a jury. But the judge can decide to admit it if its force in proving an issue in the case outweighs its prejudice to the defendant.</p> <p>A further ground might be that the summing up on the law by the judge was unfair or unbalanced.</p> <p>The convictions at Preston crown court were part of an investigation by Greater Manchester detectives into 136 suspicious deaths. Since the convictions on January 31, a further 39 complaints have been made to police, bringing the total to 175.</p> <p>In an interview with the Law Society Gazette, Ms Ball, who specialises in defending doctors and dentists accused of misconduct, reveals today that Dr Shipman is not the first alleged murderer she has represented. She has also acted for a doctor accused of murdering her own child, and her firm represented John Bodkin Adams, the Eastbourne doctor suspected of murdering a number of elderly women patients in the 1950s. He was charged with only one murder and acquitted.</p> <p>She reveals that as Shipman was charged with more and more murders she had no inside information on what the final tally was likely to be. \"I had absolutely no more idea than the next person. I was reading the papers as avidly as anyone else.\"</p> <p>To those who ask how she could defend an alleged serial killer, she says: \"No one would criticise a doctor who rendered a defendant medical treatment, or a newspaper vendor who sold a paper. It is essential for the workings of the judicial system that those charged should be represented.</p> <p>\"I may turn a client away because their work is not the sort of work I do, but I don't turn clients away because I don't like the sound of their story.\"</p> <p>Shipman was moved on Monday to the top-security Franklands prison in Co Durham after prison governors learned that the mother of two warders at Manchester prison may have been one of his victims.</p>",

Ms Ball said other grounds under consideration were the use of \"similar fact\" evidence at the trial. As a general rule, evidence of a defendant's misconduct on other occasions or his propensity to behaviour of a certain type cannot be put before a jury. But the judge can decide to admit it if its force in proving an issue in the case outweighs its prejudice to the defendant. A further ground might be that the summing up on the law by the judge was unfair or unbalanced. The convictions at Preston crown court were part of an investigation by Greater Manchester detectives into 136 suspicious deaths. Since the convictions on January 31, a further 39 complaints have been made to police, bringing the total to 175. In an interview with the Law Society Gazette, Ms Ball, who specialises in defending doctors and dentists accused of misconduct, reveals today that Dr Shipman is not the first alleged murderer she has represented. She has also acted for a doctor accused of murdering her own child, and her firm represented John Bodkin Adams, the Eastbourne doctor suspected of murdering a number of elderly women patients in the 1950s. He was charged with only one murder and acquitted. She reveals that as Shipman was charged with more and more murders she had no inside information on what the final tally was likely to be. \"I had absolutely no more idea than the next person. I was reading the papers as avidly as anyone else.\" To those who ask how she could defend an alleged serial killer, she says: \"No one would criticise a doctor who rendered a defendant medical treatment, or a newspaper vendor who sold a paper. It is essential for the workings of the judicial system that those charged should be represented. \"I may turn a client away because their work is not the sort of work I do, but I don't turn clients away because I don't like the sound of their story.\" Shipman was moved on Monday to the top-security Franklands prison in Co Durham after prison governors learned that the mother of two warders at Manchester prison may have been one of his victims.",

You can't help imagining that the entire borough consists of armour-plated socialites who close their eyes when they talk to you, and sleek bankers with second homes and crocodile smiles.</p> <p>But, like most of the affluent parts of London, Kensington and Chelsea has surprisingly deep pockets of poverty. Thirty-eight per cent of the inhabitants of the Earl's Court ward, for example, live in social housing.</p> <p>Like impoverished people throughout Britain, one of their major concerns is traffic. The lives of the poor are blighted by inequitable mobility: the capacity of the rest of the world to move past them, and their own incapacity to move away. In 1997, the government insisted that the borough turn three of its roads into \"red routes\": narrow urban motorways designed to speed up the traffic. Local people knew that the traffic volume, the noise and pollution outside their homes would increase, and they started casting around for the means to challenge the government's decision. Before long, they discovered that they had only one option: to take the council to court in the hope of forcing it to hold a public inquiry.</p> <p>They lost, and the four people who brought the case now face costs of some \u00a3150,000. Two weeks ago, the council decided that, if necessary, it would send in the bailiffs. If you kill through careless driving, you can expect to get away with a \u00a3500 fine. If you challenge the schemes which generate the traffic, you can expect to be ruined.</p> <p>There is scarcely a more expensive pursuit in Britain than objecting to development. A few weeks ago I was handed a copy of a letter sent by solicitors for Sainsbury's to a man who had contested a compulsory purchase order. \"We recognise,\" the solicitors tenderly informed him, \"that these situations are often uncomfortable for an objector without an interest in the land ... especially because such a person is not protected against any award of costs.\" Warnings like this are common. Developers threaten both individual objectors and local authorities, insisting that if they don't receive approval for their schemes, they will go to appeal. If they win, the council could face costs of hundreds of thousands of pounds. Councillors have been warned that if they don't approve certain development schemes, they could be individually surcharged.</p> <p>In every other country in the European Union, local people can use the planning system to object to development. In Britain, only developers can appeal against a council's decision: the arguments of objectors are officially inaudible, even when the council has granted planning permission for a scheme not envisaged in its local plan. Appealing to the ombudsman is useless: objectors have to demonstrate both that the local authority is guilty of maladministration and that the development would have been rejected if the case had been handled properly. Even if they succeed, the ombudsman has no powers to enforce her decision. Judicial review is formidably expensive and unlikely to work: applicants have to demonstrate that a council's decision was \"unlawful, perverse or procedurally improper\".</p> <p>The control of development is the single most important determinant of our quality of life. It decides whether or not a city or a district has sufficient employment, and whose needs that employment meets. It determines whether the poor are housed, whether children have open spaces in which to play, whether the air is breathable, the streets safe, the community extant. When we are unable to object to development, the key decisions about how we live are taken by people who hope to profit from our exclusion.</p> <p>Before the general election, Labour pledged to give British people a right of appeal against development decisions not approved by the local plan. But, like the robust freedom of information act the party promised, planning reform now appears to have been re-classified by No 10 as a \"chattering classes issue\", meaning that the need for change is understood only by people who are reasonably well-informed. As the numbers of such people are likely to be small, the promise can safely be broken. If, as J\u00f6rg Haider claims, there are \"similarities\" between his programme and Tony Blair's, then this is surely where they lie.</p> <p>Instead of the democratisation promised, the government is now speeding up the planning process in response to \"business need\", relaxing development constraints \"to promote competition\", transferring the right to question major developments from local people to a cruelly whipped parliament and toying with restricting the number of objectors who can speak at public inquiries.</p> <p>Unheard, unrepresented, we can only watch as the subtle threads which tie our surroundings together are snapped.

      "bodyText": "It is not easy to sympathise with the residents of Kensington and Chelsea. They are, after all, the people who inflicted upon us first Alan Clark and then Michael Portillo. You can't help imagining that the entire borough consists of armour-plated socialites who close their eyes when they talk to you, and sleek bankers with second homes and crocodile smiles. But, like most of the affluent parts of London, Kensington and Chelsea has surprisingly deep pockets of poverty. Thirty-eight per cent of the inhabitants of the Earl's Court ward, for example, live in social housing. Like impoverished people throughout Britain, one of their major concerns is traffic. The lives of the poor are blighted by inequitable mobility: the capacity of the rest of the world to move past them, and their own incapacity to move away. In 1997, the government insisted that the borough turn three of its roads into \"red routes\": narrow urban motorways designed to speed up the traffic. Local people knew that the traffic volume, the noise and pollution outside their homes would increase, and they started casting around for the means to challenge the government's decision. Before long, they discovered that they had only one option: to take the council to court in the hope of forcing it to hold a public inquiry. They lost, and the four people who brought the case now face costs of some \u00a3150,000. Two weeks ago, the council decided that, if necessary, it would send in the bailiffs. If you kill through careless driving, you can expect to get away with a \u00a3500 fine. If you challenge the schemes which generate the traffic, you can expect to be ruined. There is scarcely a more expensive pursuit in Britain than objecting to development. A few weeks ago I was handed a copy of a letter sent by solicitors for Sainsbury's to a man who had contested a compulsory purchase order. \"We recognise,\" the solicitors tenderly informed him, \"that these situations are often uncomfortable for an objector without an interest in the land ... especially because such a person is not protected against any award of costs.\" Warnings like this are common. Developers threaten both individual objectors and local authorities, insisting that if they don't receive approval for their schemes, they will go to appeal. If they win, the council could face costs of hundreds of thousands of pounds. Councillors have been warned that if they don't approve certain development schemes, they could be individually surcharged. In every other country in the European Union, local people can use the planning system to object to development. In Britain, only developers can appeal against a council's decision: the arguments of objectors are officially inaudible, even when the council has granted planning permission for a scheme not envisaged in its local plan. Appealing to the ombudsman is useless: objectors have to demonstrate both that the local authority is guilty of maladministration and that the development would have been rejected if the case had been handled properly. Even if they succeed, the ombudsman has no powers to enforce her decision. Judicial review is formidably expensive and unlikely to work: applicants have to demonstrate that a council's decision was \"unlawful, perverse or procedurally improper\". The control of development is the single most important determinant of our quality of life. It decides whether or not a city or a district has sufficient employment, and whose needs that employment meets. It determines whether the poor are housed, whether children have open spaces in which to play, whether the air is breathable, the streets safe, the community extant. When we are unable to object to development, the key decisions about how we live are taken by people who hope to profit from our exclusion. Before the general election, Labour pledged to give British people a right of appeal against development decisions not approved by the local plan. But, like the robust freedom of information act the party promised, planning reform now appears to have been re-classified by No 10 as a \"chattering classes issue\", meaning that the need for change is understood only by people who are reasonably well-informed. As the numbers of such people are likely to be small, the promise can safely be broken. If, as J\u00f6rg Haider claims, there are \"similarities\" between his programme and Tony Blair's, then this is surely where they lie. Instead of the democratisation promised, the government is now speeding up the planning process in response to \"business need\", relaxing development constraints \"to promote competition\", transferring the right to question major developments from local people to a cruelly whipped parliament and toying with restricting the number of objectors who can speak at public inquiries. Unheard, unrepresented, we can only watch as the subtle threads which tie our surroundings together are snapped. We were promised a people's Britain, but in what sense does it belong to us if we cannot determine how it develops?",

In the Walker case, however, the motives remain unclear.</p> <p>A colleague and I recently probed newspaper reports where women had been found guilty in court of making false allegations of rape.

      "bodyText": "Nicci Gerrard and Clare Dyer (The price of crying rape, G2 February 9) highlight some important issues in relation to making allegations of rape. The perplexing case of Lynn Walker who was ordered to pay \u00a3400,000 in damages has brought out the need to consider what actually underpins false allegations, for - while some feminists may be reluctant to entertain the notion - sometimes women do make false accusations. In the Walker case, however, the motives remain unclear. A colleague and I recently probed newspaper reports where women had been found guilty in court of making false allegations of rape. Such reports are usually brief and short on facts. Nevertheless, the motivation seemed complicated, but rarely fuelled by a wish to get a particular man in trouble. More usually, there seemed to be a desire to get herself \"out of trouble\". In each case the woman probably found herself in a difficult situation which she thought she could control by using the accusation of rape. Since the 1976 act, consent has been identified as the central issue in rape cases. Sadly, dangerous myths and misleading stereotypes tend to be combined in \"normal\" cases to construct a false picture of pervasive false accusations surrounding consent.

I spoke from my own experience as a gay priest. I have never before had a sermon received with such warmth and support. Nobody walked out or uttered any protest. Yes, some of our religious leaders may still be living in the dark ages, but the people in the pews, thank God, are not necessarily taking their lead from them. <br><b>Rev Jonathan Thacker </b> <br>Scunthorpe <br><a href=\"mailto:Jon@han195.freeserve.co.uk\">Jon@han195.freeserve.co.uk</a></p> <p>\u0095 I hate to disappoint Lady Young and the snarling prelates but their judicial colleagues in the Lords have already abolished part of section 28 right under their noses.

So in outlawing \"the teaching ... of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship\", section 28 is irrelevant. <br><b>Tony Bird</b> <br>London</p>",

However, until teachers can stand up in class and assert that families are about love and respect and not about fitting into a certain mould, I shall feel that the burden of social education falls unfairly on children like mine who can only, in all honesty, say that their dad is as good a dad as anyone's. Gillian Darton York \u0095 Well done, Jonathan Freedland for walking out of a synagogue during a sermon which denounced homosexuals as \"abnormal deviants\" (Goodbye to all this, February 9). But, thankfully, all is not totally dark in our religious institutions. Last Sunday at St George's, here in Scunthorpe, I preached about the despicable way in which the church, over the years, has treated women, non-whites, divorcees and gays. I spoke from my own experience as a gay priest. I have never before had a sermon received with such warmth and support. Nobody walked out or uttered any protest. Yes, some of our religious leaders may still be living in the dark ages, but the people in the pews, thank God, are not necessarily taking their lead from them. Rev Jonathan Thacker Scunthorpe Jon@han195.freeserve.co.uk \u0095 I hate to disappoint Lady Young and the snarling prelates but their judicial colleagues in the Lords have already abolished part of section 28 right under their noses. Last October, in the case of Fitzpatrick v Sterling Housing Association, the law lords ruled that same-sex partners living together as couples should be defined in law as \"a family\". So in outlawing \"the teaching ... of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship\", section 28 is irrelevant. Tony Bird London",

When we learn that it is young women who are showing the sharpest increase in heterosexually acquired HIV infection, the future looks bleak.</p> <p>Twenty eight per cent of infection among women last year was in the 25-29 age group, according to the public health laboratory service. In the past nine months, Positively Women, the support group for women living with HIV, has seen a 23% increase in women using its services compared with 14% for the whole of the previous year. Although the majority of these women probably became infected in sub-Saharan Africa as tourists or before coming to Britain and much of this increase is the result of increased detection (the government's new policy of offering universal antenatal screening), it's clear that there is a young generation of women who don't consider HIV to be relevant.</p> <p>And why should they? It is only through knowing and seeing someone who is infected that the threat becomes real. Compared to other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), HIV is still relatively rare in Britain. In the 80s, Aids was everywhere. Billboard and television warnings were designed to put fear into people and did. The very visible and ominous Don't Die of Ignorance campaign of that decade has passed this generation by.</p> <p>Whereas young people of the 80s were warned about the dangers of HIV, those of the 90s were fed images of ecstasy casualty Leah Betts on a ventilator and told they would die not through reckless sex but from reckless drug-taking. The lethal unknown is not whether a one-night stand is carrying an infection but if that night's drugs are bad.</p> <p>Women are still more concerned about avoiding unplanned pregnancy than about STDs, according to research by Durex. For young women, unwanted pregnancy remains a close and visible fear. Pregnancy could happen to them because it has happened to friends, sisters, mothers. They have been told that getting pregnant as a teenager is a tragedy and fear of an unwanted child often overshadows concern about STDs.</p> <p>Women find carrying condoms difficult, too. \"There's still a stigma about women who carry condoms being loose,\" says Paula Doran of the Family Planning Association, who has spent 10 years listening and advising at the end of HIV helplines and counselling people before they take the HIV test. \"It says, I'm ready for it. The idea that women should have to be seduced and persuaded to have sex continues.\"</p> <p>Perhaps this goes some way to explaining the news this week that actresses Dervla Kirwan and Mina Anwar are to market a \"safe sex\" bra with a condom sized pocket in one of the cups. Like those sanitary towels individually wrapped in multi-coloured plastic, the discreet design reflects the anxiety girls feel about carrying condoms.</p> <p>Men buy almost twice as many condoms as women, according to last year's Durex report on sexual attitudes in Britain. Although more men than women said they disliked using them, 10% more women did not use a condom with a new partner. It seems that while the sexually active young woman has learned to say what turns her on, she struggles to find the words to insist on a condom.</p> <p>The difficulties for women infected in sub-Saharan Africa are even greater. Miriam, now 29, was diagnosed with HIV when she arrived from Uganda 10 years ago and four months pregnant. \"It never crossed my mind I'd be positive,\" she says. \"I didn't know about the disease and condoms just weren't used.\"</p> <p>She has had two partners. Fortunately, her son and long-term partner are both negative. Elizabeth Kawonza, of the Terrence Higgins Trust African team in London says women from Africa who have come to Britain face pressures to have a child because it bestows honour and status. \"It's often difficult for married women to insist on condoms. In many parts of Africa condoms are understood to be for prostitutes so 'good girls' don't carry them.\"</p> <p>For those women who have succeded in introducing rubber into that first intimate moment, another more delicate vocabulary is needed when a relationship becomes long-term. This month's Cosmopolitan magazine identifies the HIV test as \"the new marriage\" - the moment a couple decides to get tested, it says, has become a new mark of commitment.</p> <p>The analogy is exaggerated. Although the number of heterosexual couples taking an HIV test has doubled in the last 10 years, in reality many women find asking a partner to take a test can be difficult in case it's construed as a character slur.</p> <p>Susan Ross, 27, asked her partner to have a test after months of using condoms because she wanted to switch to the pill. She went, he didn't. \"He refused to engage with me about why he wouldn't,\" she says.</p> <p>\"It made me feel he wasn't interested in keeping me safe and suspicious of what he might have to hide. I didn't feel confident enough to force it. I felt alone in having the responsibility for babies and sexual health on my shoulders.\"</p> <p>Protection from HIV for women is so dependent on cultural pressures: how much she can say, ask for, demand. Infection rates are part of a bigger picture where teenage pregnancies are not decreasing and young women have the highest rates of the STD chlamydia.

We learned from gay men that explicit and erotic material was the most effective way to convey messages about how to practise safe-sex.\"</p> <p>Here's the rub.

The Labour party had hatched a plan to persuade scriptwriters to include more favourable comment on government policy within TV soap operas. It was suggested that plot lines could contain political messages.",

The latest home office figures, which put the number of officers at 125,464, raised new doubts that the home secretary's promised extra 5,000 recruits would not be sufficient to reverse the fall in police numbers over the next three years. Chief constables gave a mixed welcome to the announcement yesterday of the detailed allocation of the extra 5,000 recruits between forces. Humberside's chief constable, David Westwood, who bid for 251 extra officers but only received 74, described the decision as a \"body blow\". However the Norfolk police warmly welcomed its extra 66 officers as part of a serious attempt to tackle rural crime. The home office figures show that police numbers have now fallen by 1,600 since the May 1997 general election, from 127,158 to 125,464. In the past six months the biggest falls have been in the Metropolitan police (down 188); Merseyside (down 140) and West Yorkshire (down 105).

On one occasion Mrs Wray alleges that her husband, a former boxer, hit her with such force that she required hospital treatment for a vision problem. While undergoing the treatment at Western Infirmary, Glasgow, in February 1990, Mrs Wray told her doctor, Gordon Dutton, of the attack, the court heard. Professor Dutton told the court of session in Edinburgh that Mrs Wray had asked him not to write down the cause of her injury, but she had stuck in his mind because of her considerable distress. Prof Dutton was giving evidence in a \u00a31.5m defamation action by Mr Wray, 61, following the publication of an article on his marriage in the Mail on Sunday which accused him of beating his wife. Associated Newspapers, the publisher, is contesting the action, claiming the story is true. The court heard that Prof Dutton had treated Mrs Wray, from Milngavie, near Glasgow, for eye injuries on more than one occasion.

Aprilia - which filmed a commercial featuring all five members and launched a special range of Spice Sonic scooters adorned with images of all five - says the band turned into a \"total marketing flop\" when Ms Halliwell left in May 1998.</p> <p>The remaining four Spice Girls and Ms Halliwell have launched a counter-suit, claiming \u00a3212,000 in unpaid sponsorship and royalty fees from Aprilia.</p> <p>Ms Bunton said she had not believed that Ms Halliwell would leave the group.

      "bodyText": "The Spice Girls never believed that Geri Halliwell would leave the group, Baby Spice Emma Bunton told the high court in London yesterday. Ms Bunton, 24, was giving evidence in a two-way legal action between the Spice Girls and the sponsor of the group's 1998 world tour, which is claiming that Ginger Spice's departure just weeks into the series of concerts cost it \u00a31.6m in lost profits. Italian motor cycle manufacturer Aprilia, which signed a \u00a3500,000 deal with the group to promote its products, claims the Spice Girls were aware of Ms Halliwell's plans to quit when they signed the contract. Aprilia - which filmed a commercial featuring all five members and launched a special range of Spice Sonic scooters adorned with images of all five - says the band turned into a \"total marketing flop\" when Ms Halliwell left in May 1998. The remaining four Spice Girls and Ms Halliwell have launched a counter-suit, claiming \u00a3212,000 in unpaid sponsorship and royalty fees from Aprilia. Ms Bunton said she had not believed that Ms Halliwell would leave the group. This was despite claims by Ms Halliwell in her autobiography, If Only, that she had confided in Ms Bunton on two occasions in March 1998 that she planned to leave. Ms Bunton said: \"Things were said quite flippantly all the time. We never believed she would go.\" During 40 minutes of questioning before Mrs Justice Arden, Ms Bunton said she had a \"terrible memory\". She told Andrew Sutcliffe, representing Aprilia, that she had forgotten a conversation on the tour coach in Frankfurt with Ms Halliwell, during which she announced plans to leave the Spice Girls in September 1998, at the end of their tour. Mr Sutcliffe said that when Ms Halliwell made her first announcement about leaving in March, just weeks into the group's tour, everyone stopped talking. Ms Bunton recalled that band member Melanie Chisolm had said Ms Halliwell was trying \"to do a Robbie\" - a reference to Robbie Williams who left his band Take That to start a solo career - but that Ms Halliwell said she would \"stick it out\" until September. Mr Sutcliffe asked whether the Spice Girls had made their minds up not to tell Aprilia that Ms Halliwell would be leaving, rendering its promotional work for its Spice Sonic scooter out of date. \"That would not have occurred to me,\" she replied. She also denied claims by Aprilia that the group had been \"bolshie\" in their public appearances for the company, saying: \"I know that I would always be smiling. We were always 100% professional.\" Giving evidence earlier, the group's solicitor Andrew Thompson admitted that he knew in April 1998 that Ms Halliwell was planning to leave, before the Spice Girls signed the Aprilia deal, but said the company should have known there was always a risk that the line-up could change. The hearing continues tomorrow, when Ms Halliwell will give evidence for the band.",

Lord Justice Simon Brown hoped to give the court's decision \"sometime next week\" but could give no immediate indication of what it would be. Pupils to learn citizenship MPs yesterday approved citizenship as a new subject on the national curriculum. All secondary schools will have a legal obligation to teach it from 2002, but David Blunkett, the education and employment secretary, urged them to start voluntarily. Fatal wait for ambulance Rose Hillman, 85, waited seven hours with a fractured pelvis when Royal Sussex hospital called an ambulance to return her to a nursing home in Bevendean, East Sussex, the Brighton and Hove coroner heard yesterday. She died a day later of a heart attack. The inquest was told the usual 12 ambulances were down to eight that night, but an internal inquiry was being held. Verdict: accidental death. Census debate on 'family' The number of children brought up within a step-family will outstrip children being raised by both natural parents by 2010, Stepfamily Scotland predicted yesterday. As wording of the census, due next year, is debated in the Scottish parliament, the charity has been advising ministers how to define families in light of the fact couples increasingly live together rather than marry new partners. Three jailed for murder Adam Shepherd, 18, Paul Wallington, 19, and Christopher Hills, 22, all of High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire, were jailed for life at Reading crown court yesterday for kicking to death Bradley Bolton, 34, in July last year.

His remarks came after David Heathcoat-Amory, the shadow chief secretary, appeared on Radio 4's Today programme to explain the apparent difference between the Tory leader and the shadow chancellor. \"He may have used a different word at a different specific time, but he has absolutely reinforced the promise that over the period of a parliament we will get the overall burden of tax down,\" Mr Heathcoat-Amory said. \"That's what counts for people. It's not the rate of income tax at any one time, it's the total tax that they pay.\" It was \"totally untrue\" that Mr Portillo had unchallenged authority over economic policy. \"Michael Portillo works under William Hague,\" he said. Tory MPs are likely to be disappointed - though hardly surprised - that relations between the Hague and Portillo camps appear to have soured so soon after Mr Portillo's triumphant return to the Commons. Mr Hague's aides were stressing that they were not pointing the finger at Mr Portillo himself, merely at over-enthusiastic acolytes. The whole episode has echoes of the relationship between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Mr Hague gave Mr Portillo a free hand in setting the party's economic policy in a private handwritten letter, echoing the Blair-Brown deal of 1994 when the future chancellor agreed, after lengthy negotiations, to give Mr Blair a free run for the Labour leadership. Since then the Blair and Brown camps have sniped at each other, although the two men are still close.",

At a secret meeting, believed to have been held in the mountains of northern Iran, Kurdish rebel commanders confirmed they would make their hitherto temporary ceasefire permanent. A statement dismissed reports of a fundamental split within the movement - although the PKK has disowned a renegade group active in the eastern province of Tunceli, which has rejected the new policy. \"Our congress has confirmed the decision of the party leader to stop the armed struggle,\" the official PKK announcement said. \"The problems of Turkey will find resolution by democratic means.\" The extraordinary conference was the first since Ocalan appealed for peace after his capture by Turkish special forces in Kenya last year. The PKK leader was sentenced to death for launching the insurrection in Turkey's mainly Kurdish south-east, which is estimated to have cost 37,000 lives. But last month Turkey's prime minister, Bulent Ecevit, said he would suspend the capital sentence pending an appeal to the European court of human rights in Strasbourg.

Why, then, did Surrogate Babies concentrate on the intimate lives of a handful of couples and prospective host mothers in such toe-curling detail? Of course this is a difficult process: nobody would resort to surrogacy if they didn't face reproductive problems in their own lives.

But in order to labour the point, Surrogate Babies turned the story of Michelle and Paul, who can't have children, and Marsha, their would-be surrogate, into an emotional bloodbath. The last 20 minutes of the programme showed the collapse of the arrangement in a welter of suspicion, bad temper and mutual distrust.

This freedom state is known as QGP. </p> <p>But positive identification of the quark gluon plasma in these collisions is extremely difficult. The QGP state would have only a very transient existence before cooling, its quarks and gluons rapidly coalescing into the familiar stuff of which we are made. Even within an atom's length of the QGP, familiar matter is the rule and the detectors at Cern are far more remote than this.

Still, they retain enough memory of the initial quark-gluon state to provide evidence for its for mation, like the grin of the Cheshire Cat in Alice in Wonderland that remains even after the cat had disappeared. </p> <p>For example, the relative abundance of different varieties of the familiar particles is predicted to change when QGP has been present relative to what is the case in more normal circumstances. </p> <p>So-called \"strange\" particles are expected to become more important while the ephemeral \"psi\" particles become rarer. The relative speeds and distributions of some of the particles can, by quantum theory, enable one to infer the size of the QGP region; the result here also is in line with what the theorists expected. </p> <p>Experimenters at Cern have seen tantalising glimpses of each of these phenomena but feared there might be some mundane explanation, rather than them being fossil relics of the QGP. </p> <p>As the experiments have gathered more data over the months their quality has improved and interpretations of the phenomena without invoking the existence of QGP have become increasingly untenable. </p> <p>These, and other technical observations, have led to today's announcement. Even so, the Cern teams admit that this is \"proof by circumstantial evidence\". Conclusive proof should come from more direct measurements, such as the detection of electromagnetic signals that are emitted direct from the quarks within the QGP. In the immediate future this will become possible at the much higher fireball temperatures about to be provided by RHIC, the relativistic heavy ion collider, now beginning operation at Brookhaven National Laboratory in the USA. </p> <p>Today's announcement by Cern will create great excitement as to what the RHIC experiments will reveal during the next few years. </p> <p>\u0095 Frank Close's latest book, Lucifer's Legacy - The Meaning Of Asymmetry, will be published by Oxford University Press on March 16.</p>",

The relative speeds and distributions of some of the particles can, by quantum theory, enable one to infer the size of the QGP region; the result here also is in line with what the theorists expected. Experimenters at Cern have seen tantalising glimpses of each of these phenomena but feared there might be some mundane explanation, rather than them being fossil relics of the QGP. As the experiments have gathered more data over the months their quality has improved and interpretations of the phenomena without invoking the existence of QGP have become increasingly untenable. These, and other technical observations, have led to today's announcement. Even so, the Cern teams admit that this is \"proof by circumstantial evidence\". Conclusive proof should come from more direct measurements, such as the detection of electromagnetic signals that are emitted direct from the quarks within the QGP. In the immediate future this will become possible at the much higher fireball temperatures about to be provided by RHIC, the relativistic heavy ion collider, now beginning operation at Brookhaven National Laboratory in the USA. Today's announcement by Cern will create great excitement as to what the RHIC experiments will reveal during the next few years. \u0095 Frank Close's latest book, Lucifer's Legacy - The Meaning Of Asymmetry, will be published by Oxford University Press on March 16.",

      "bodyText": "Rhodri Morgan was last night set to become first secretary in the Welsh assembly at his third attempt after Alun Michael was forced to resign the post minutes before a vote of no confidence was carried against him in Cardiff. Within hours of doing so the man whom Tony Blair made his reluctant standard-bearer in Wales had any last hope of survival dashed when Labour's 28 assembly members made clear they would not re-submit his name to the assembly. Instead they made the popular Mr Morgan acting first secretary, then agreed unanimously to put him forward for the job itself. Previously Mr Michael's economic minister, Mr Morgan will be ratified on Tuesday. There will be a price: wider consultation, especially with the Liberal Democrats. Downing Street and Labour HQ at Millbank are acutely aware that Ken Livingstone, front-runner to be Labour's candidate for \"devolved\" mayor of London, will be watching for further attempts to steer events. So they were quick to embrace Mr Morgan as as man they could do business with. \"He's earned his spurs, there's no question of not being able to deal with him,\" said one party official. Mr Blair's spokesman said: \"I know you think we're an absolute bunch of control freaks. But devolution has happened.\" In the most dramatic day of political infighting since devolved governments took over in Wales and Scotland, Mr Michael finally abandoned a series of increasingly desperate manoeuvres to cling to office that left Mr Blair wrong-footed 150 miles away in Westminster. The prime minister, who had backed Mr Michael to succeed Ron Davies despite grassroots support for Mr Morgan, knew at lunchtime of his protege's intention to stand down. But he dared not reveal it when faced with William Hague's taunts at Commons question time lest Welsh voters concluded that - yet again - Downing Street and Millbank were calling the shots. Mr Blair was left looking silly. In the event Mr Michael resigned at 3.08pm, minutes after the prime minister had expressed his \"full confidence\" in him. It allowed Tory MPs - who quickly heard the news on their pagers - to demand that Mr Blair promise not to interfere in the choice of Mr Michael's successor. In reality the situation had long since slipped beyond Downing Street's control. Opposition assembly members in Cardiff used an attack on what was seen as Whitehall's lack of support for EU funding for south and west Wales to press home what was chiefly a personal attack on Mr Michael's uncharismatic and over-centralised style of management. Last night Labour AMs met in secret session to decide how best to fill the leadership vacuum created by Mr Michael's decision to jump before being formally pushed by the combined 31-27 majority of the Tories, Plaid Cymru and Liberal Democrats. One Labour AM abstained. Mr Michael, 57, the MP for Cardiff South and Penarth, became Welsh secretary and Downing Street's man in Wales after Ron Davies was forced to resign over his \"moment of madness\" on Clapham Common in October 1998. But he only narrowly beat Cardiff West's Mr Morgan, 60, in Labour's electoral college. Under the proportional voting system, Mr Michael then scraped home as an AM only via the top-up list of members with no assembly constituency. It was a shaky start that he failed to put right by bridge-building with either Labour voters or AMs in the minority administration he chose to set up - after spurning Lib Dem overtures for the kind of coalition created in Edinburgh. Last night Plaid Cymru signalled that it would not now table the motion to strip the first secretary of his powers, and give them to the assembly as a body, as it would have done if Mr Michael had insisted on being renominated to the top post. The assembly's speaker, Lord Dafydd Ellis-Thomas, rebutted suggestions that devolution was being reduced to chaos. \"This is the beginning of true devolution because the assembly has asserted its views,\" he said.",

But he will not shy away from taking on central government, no doubt with his customary wit. There will still be misgivings. \"Rhodri's great entertainment and nobody can doubt his erudition,'' one Labour source said. \"But if you asked him to deliver a letter, would he remember?''",

The combined companies, which had revenues of $418 million last year, are now betting on the latest bandwagon: Linux, the clone of the old Unix operating system. Corel has already produced Corel Linux (based on Debian's version of GNU/Linux) and will launch WordPerfect Office 2000 for Linux for \u00a3150 in March. Borland's sales peaked at $482.5 million in 1991. </p> <p><strong> Hot chips</strong><br> The annual International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC), which started on Monday in San Francisco, California, is where chip manufacturers take their bragging to the limits. This year, IBM looks like winning with its IPCMOS (interlocked pipelined complementary metal oxide semiconductor) chips that it says could reach speeds of 3.3GHz to 4.5GHz, four times today's speeds. </p> <p><strong> Going giga</strong><br> Both Intel and AMD (Advanced Micro Devices) have chips running at 1GHz, which might be built this year using the production lines that are currently making 700-800MHz parts. IBM and Compaq also have 1GHz versions of their PowerPC and Alpha processors. But Intel is expected to reveal details of the next version of the Pentium - code-named Willamette, after a river in Oregon - at its Professional Developers Conference in Palm Springs, California, next week. Willamette may appear in October, and is expected to replace the Pentium III in 2001-2002. It will run at speeds of 1GHz plus. </p> <p>Intel is also working on a Celeron (Pentium II) replacement - code-named Timna, after a valley famous for its copper mines in Biblical times - which will have built-in graphics. </p> <p><strong> CDs in minutes</strong><br> It takes only six minutes to copy any tpe of CD using Odixion's DigiCopier DG1-12X which, as the name implies, is a 12x speed CD-R burner. But the system's real appeal is its ease of use. The DigiCopier is a standalone device which is operated via a simple LCD screen: no technical knowledge is required. </p> <p> The new DigiCopier can also be used to make rewritable CD-RW discs, in which case it operates at 4x speed. The system does not need to be connected to a computer, but includes a SCSI interface and software so that it can be linked to a PC or Apple Macintosh. The DigiCopier DG1-12X, including 10 Philips 12X Silver Premium blank discs, costs \u00a3849 plus VAT (\u00a3997.58): if you already own a PC, it's not the cheapest way to copy CDs. But for companies sending out images, presentations, music and other large data files on CD, speed and convenience could make it an attractive purchase. </p> <p><strong> Suits you, sir</strong><br> Is that a mobile phone in your pocket, or are you just dressed strangely?

This year, IBM looks like winning with its IPCMOS (interlocked pipelined complementary metal oxide semiconductor) chips that it says could reach speeds of 3.3GHz to 4.5GHz, four times today's speeds. Going giga Both Intel and AMD (Advanced Micro Devices) have chips running at 1GHz, which might be built this year using the production lines that are currently making 700-800MHz parts. IBM and Compaq also have 1GHz versions of their PowerPC and Alpha processors. But Intel is expected to reveal details of the next version of the Pentium - code-named Willamette, after a river in Oregon - at its Professional Developers Conference in Palm Springs, California, next week. Willamette may appear in October, and is expected to replace the Pentium III in 2001-2002. It will run at speeds of 1GHz plus. Intel is also working on a Celeron (Pentium II) replacement - code-named Timna, after a valley famous for its copper mines in Biblical times - which will have built-in graphics. CDs in minutes It takes only six minutes to copy any tpe of CD using Odixion's DigiCopier DG1-12X which, as the name implies, is a 12x speed CD-R burner. But the system's real appeal is its ease of use. The DigiCopier is a standalone device which is operated via a simple LCD screen: no technical knowledge is required. The new DigiCopier can also be used to make rewritable CD-RW discs, in which case it operates at 4x speed. The system does not need to be connected to a computer, but includes a SCSI interface and software so that it can be linked to a PC or Apple Macintosh. The DigiCopier DG1-12X, including 10 Philips 12X Silver Premium blank discs, costs \u00a3849 plus VAT (\u00a3997.58): if you already own a PC, it's not the cheapest way to copy CDs. But for companies sending out images, presentations, music and other large data files on CD, speed and convenience could make it an attractive purchase. Suits you, sir Is that a mobile phone in your pocket, or are you just dressed strangely? Launching a new mobile phone, NEC teamed up with designer Alexander McQueen to create a suit especially designed for the mobile phone-toting man about town. The result is this silvery affair, which effortlessly combines the need to have a mobile phone in your breast pocket with a fetish for dressing like Dr Evil from the Austin Powers movies.

      "body": "<p>Yvonne Krasner is a brave woman, according to her friends. \"People said to me, oh you were very brave. But I didn't see it like that. When you are looking for a relationship, you have to help yourself.\"</p> <p>If you are alone this Valentine's Day, Krasner's bravery might interest you. Nine months ago, she posted a message on Arkline.com, an internet dating service. She is 29, a charity worker from London with her own teeth and a personality. It was a courageous move. </p> <p>\"A friend of mine twisted my arm,\" she says, after checking with her fianc\u008e that the circumstances of their introduction can be revealed without mortification. \"My friend persuaded me that no one would get hold of my home details.\" </p> <p>But, whadyaknow? Someone got hold of her heart instead and she and Richard Cohen, a 30-year-old marketing manager from London, were engaged to be married a week last Sunday.</p> <p>Krasner's behaviour only counts as brave if you see the internet as a playground for predators and deviants. Otherwise, praising her courage is a rather underhand compliment, reminiscent of the woman who turns up at a party in a monstrous frock, to be told in silky tones: \"How very brave.\" </p> <p>Yet while it will always be easy to sneer at introduction services, whatever their medium, the impact that the web is having on dating conventions is such, that, \"we met over the net\" is fading as an admission of desperation and fast becoming a standard line. Many of the couples exchanging chocolate hearts on Monday will have conducted the first flush of their courtship over the internet. Joe Johnson is 29, his fianc\u008ee, Deborah, 27. The two \"met\" three years ago in an obscure US chatroom. \"I was telling a joke,\" says Joe, \"and before I could type out the punchline, Deborah had finished it for me. It was apparent that we had the same sense of humour.\"</p> <p>The slow trajectory of their relationship is typical of web-spun love affairs. First, they revealed the real names behind their log-ons. Then, they exchanged email addresses. Finally, they swapped phone numbers. \"It was four or five months before we actually met up,\" says Joe. He travelled down from Wigan to see Deborah in London and on new year's eve, 1998, asked her to marry him. \"You get to know each other slowly over the web, which stands you in good stead when the arguments come later.\"</p> <p>\"You can chat to someone over the web without really committing yourself,\" says Krasner. \"There are no strings, no ties: you don't have to speak to them on the phone. It all happens very casually.\"</p> <p>None of this should come as a surprise. Think about it: with the web as cupid, you don't have to meet the person until you have corresponded for long enough to be sure they won't bore you; you can run a whole stable of potential lovers without risk of having your polygamy exposed; and if you attach importance to the quality of your prospective partner's prose style, you can weed out the time wasters who type in upper case, or use three exclamation marks with each statement, after a single email.</p> <p>\"Using the web is a lot less nerveracking for making first contact,\" says Guy Morris, the operations director for Dateline UK. \"Whereas you might be nervous about making a phone call, you can send an email saying hello with very little emotional effort.\" In 1997, dateline.uk.com had 168 clients and received 1079 hits a day. Last week, it registered 1,142 clients and was doing traffic in the region of 10,000 hits a day.</p> <p>Like most on-line dating services, it has more male than female clients and relies on users filling in a questionnaire, much the same as Dateline's print service. What happens next, however, is almost a return to the epistolary romances of the 19th century. Flirtatious emails fly back and forth in gentle courtship that can go on for months before the two parties meet.</p> <p>\"A hundred years ago, a woman would post two letters a day to a man who lived on the other side of town,\" says Jenni Trent Hughes, the agony aunt at Handbag.com and author of the On-Line Guide To Dating. \"That was how people got to know each other - on paper. This is just the 21st century version.\" </p> <p>\"Because we're both Jewish, it was almost like going back to the very basics of forming a relationship, when all you did was talk,\" says Krasner. \"Sometimes you didn't even meet until you had talked enough to realise that this was potentially the right person.\"</p> <p>Given the space available on the web, the idea is that you can lessen the chances of finding the wrong person by filling in pages of personal trivia. You can specify what hair and eye colour you prefer, what height and breadth, even what dietary requirements, although, strangely, the dating services are coy about asking for users' political persuasion or reading habits.</p> <p>The results are, at best, approximate. The conservative profile I enter in Match.com returns 405 men, among them some real clangers. For example, I am 97% compatible with a man whose catch-line is, \"I'm looking for some hot sex, are you?\" a match I can only think has been licensed on the strength of my not being a vegetarian.</p> <p>\"Crazy young thing seeks love bunny\" doesn't entice much, and \"I value honesty, having been lied to before\" is in 10-foot bargepole territory. \"I have Italian roots which have influenced my looks quite a lot\" has me envisaging the guy's hairline. </p> <p>After some false starts, however, I find Jason, a 25-year-old from Essex. \"I am a sales professional with a nice car and flat. I love to go out or stay at home. I like nice food, nice places and nice company. A sense of humour is essential.\" In his first email, Jason (not his real name) abides by the primary rule of internet dating, Flag up your Solvency. \"You get a better class of people over the internet,\" Peter Ronan had boasted earlier in the day. Ronan runs the Singles Network, a free internet service with 184 clients clinging to the belief that the cost of connection charges keeps out undesirables. \"Because the internet is still quite expensive, you are getting a classier type of person.\"</p> <p>Apart from the non-sequitur in this statement, it ignores the main virtue of internet dating: namely that it diminishes preoccupations with class, looks and other superficialities; that in spite of the eugenics of ticking eye-colour boxes, what you essentially judge your date on is his ability to banter over email. \"So much of getting to know someone is based on wondering if they are in the same class as you are or went to the same sort of school,\" says Jenni Trent Hughes.</p> <p> \"A lot of this is toned down over the internet. It comes out in the end, of course, but it's not the same barrier it is in a face to face relationship.\" Perhaps because of the lingering sense that only teenage desperados trawl the web, looking for love, the tone of Jason's first missive is influenced by a need to establish his demographic. \"My car is less than three months old and is about to have its 12,000 mile service,\" he writes. \"I live in a flat which is way bigger than I need. I have a boring job although it pays well.\"</p> <p>After one day of corresponding, however, Jason and I are getting down to the fundamentals. \"Right, Burger King for quality, quantity and value, McDonald's because sometimes you just want a small soggy cheap burger,\" he writes. \"Too right we should boycott Austria\" - and, in answer to the key question, was the Littlest Hobo sad or happy to be moving on at the end of each episode: \"I think the Littlest Hobo was happy to be moving on. It was his mission in life and that is that. He has a destiny to fulfil.\" We are compatible on every point except the last one.</p> <p>It is only at the end of the third day of our increasingly lengthy email exchanges, that the subject of looks is raised, and then as a tentative aside in the final paragraph. The downside to this mutual chivalry is, of course, that it is open to abuse. \"Be honest, we can't emphasis this enough,\" says Ronan at the Singles Network. A salient lesson can be learnt from an exchange currently raging on Koshersex.com, a Jewish dating service where the cover of an internet predator - a married man cruising for single girls - has been blown.</p> <p>\"Girls,\" reads a message, buried deep in the singles ads, \"a word of advice from his wife. Please beware of the guy advertising as above. He has destroyed many Jewish hearts and will continue to do so for as long as you allow him. Do not respond to his Spanish ad under the header ShalomBaby.\" </p> <p>The husband, if this message is genuine, ripostes further down with: \"Some people are really nasty and enjoy making other people's lives difficult. It is amazing how bitter and twisted some people are.\"</p> <p>Without the aid of body language, it is more difficult to spot the creeps in the chat rooms, although if you're sensitive to language, the clues are usually there. If everything goes well and you meet your destiny over the web, you'll find there is one thing that the new medium hasn't changed: the sentimental value attached to yellowing love letters, even when an indelible electronic version exists. </p> <p>True to history, Joe and Deborah are keeping printouts of their emails, in a box, for when they're old.</p> <p>An e-lover replies<br></p> <p> Dear Emma </p> <p>Hello. Thanks for your email, very unexpected but a very nice surprise. I have a boring job in sales, although it is very easy, pays well and gives me a new car every year or so! I love comedy and humour, especially silly humour - Bottom, Vic and Bob, Monty Python, and a ton of other stuff. I don't take life very seriously, and laugh at every opportunity. I love music, and have diverse tastes from 80s to dance, soul to rock. I do not like country, and have trouble with classical music. Oh, I am also a massive Friends fan, I hope that doesn't scare you.</p> <p>I have just started going to the gym in the last few days. I am not fat or very unfit, I just haven't done any real exercise for a while. I drive everywhere - my car is less than three months old and is about to have its 12,000 mile service. I live by myself in a flat which is way bigger than I need, but I love my space. I am a little bit mad, but I like me this way!</p> <p>I am now at that stage in life where I think I won't get older this birthday, I'll just repeat the last one a few times. Please write back soon, and tell me loads about you. Be lively. </p> <p>Jason</p> <p>Dear Emma </p> <p>I can't dance, well, I can after nine pints and a few bottles of wine, or at least I think I can. I can't play the piano, but would like one as an ornament. </p> <p>I've never really got into the whole South Park thing - I have watched a couple of episodes, and liked it, but wouldn't break my neck to watch it. I have a brilliant DVD player and I spend a lot of tv-viewing time watching good films. I only have about 20 disks as they are so expensive, but you can rent them so I do that lots too.</p> <p>Don't really know what else to say. Write back soon, maybe with some more silly questions?!? </p> <p>Bonjour </p> <p>Jason</p>",

Ronan runs the Singles Network, a free internet service with 184 clients clinging to the belief that the cost of connection charges keeps out undesirables. \"Because the internet is still quite expensive, you are getting a classier type of person.\" Apart from the non-sequitur in this statement, it ignores the main virtue of internet dating: namely that it diminishes preoccupations with class, looks and other superficialities; that in spite of the eugenics of ticking eye-colour boxes, what you essentially judge your date on is his ability to banter over email. \"So much of getting to know someone is based on wondering if they are in the same class as you are or went to the same sort of school,\" says Jenni Trent Hughes. \"A lot of this is toned down over the internet. It comes out in the end, of course, but it's not the same barrier it is in a face to face relationship.\" Perhaps because of the lingering sense that only teenage desperados trawl the web, looking for love, the tone of Jason's first missive is influenced by a need to establish his demographic. \"My car is less than three months old and is about to have its 12,000 mile service,\" he writes. \"I live in a flat which is way bigger than I need. I have a boring job although it pays well.\" After one day of corresponding, however, Jason and I are getting down to the fundamentals. \"Right, Burger King for quality, quantity and value, McDonald's because sometimes you just want a small soggy cheap burger,\" he writes. \"Too right we should boycott Austria\" - and, in answer to the key question, was the Littlest Hobo sad or happy to be moving on at the end of each episode: \"I think the Littlest Hobo was happy to be moving on. It was his mission in life and that is that. He has a destiny to fulfil.\" We are compatible on every point except the last one. It is only at the end of the third day of our increasingly lengthy email exchanges, that the subject of looks is raised, and then as a tentative aside in the final paragraph. The downside to this mutual chivalry is, of course, that it is open to abuse. \"Be honest, we can't emphasis this enough,\" says Ronan at the Singles Network. A salient lesson can be learnt from an exchange currently raging on Koshersex.com, a Jewish dating service where the cover of an internet predator - a married man cruising for single girls - has been blown. \"Girls,\" reads a message, buried deep in the singles ads, \"a word of advice from his wife. Please beware of the guy advertising as above. He has destroyed many Jewish hearts and will continue to do so for as long as you allow him. Do not respond to his Spanish ad under the header ShalomBaby.\" The husband, if this message is genuine, ripostes further down with: \"Some people are really nasty and enjoy making other people's lives difficult. It is amazing how bitter and twisted some people are.\" Without the aid of body language, it is more difficult to spot the creeps in the chat rooms, although if you're sensitive to language, the clues are usually there. If everything goes well and you meet your destiny over the web, you'll find there is one thing that the new medium hasn't changed: the sentimental value attached to yellowing love letters, even when an indelible electronic version exists. True to history, Joe and Deborah are keeping printouts of their emails, in a box, for when they're old. An e-lover replies Dear Emma Hello. Thanks for your email, very unexpected but a very nice surprise. I have a boring job in sales, although it is very easy, pays well and gives me a new car every year or so! I love comedy and humour, especially silly humour - Bottom, Vic and Bob, Monty Python, and a ton of other stuff. I don't take life very seriously, and laugh at every opportunity. I love music, and have diverse tastes from 80s to dance, soul to rock. I do not like country, and have trouble with classical music. Oh, I am also a massive Friends fan, I hope that doesn't scare you. I have just started going to the gym in the last few days. I am not fat or very unfit, I just haven't done any real exercise for a while. I drive everywhere - my car is less than three months old and is about to have its 12,000 mile service. I live by myself in a flat which is way bigger than I need, but I love my space. I am a little bit mad, but I like me this way! I am now at that stage in life where I think I won't get older this birthday, I'll just repeat the last one a few times. Please write back soon, and tell me loads about you. Be lively. Jason Dear Emma I can't dance, well, I can after nine pints and a few bottles of wine, or at least I think I can. I can't play the piano, but would like one as an ornament. I've never really got into the whole South Park thing - I have watched a couple of episodes, and liked it, but wouldn't break my neck to watch it. I have a brilliant DVD player and I spend a lot of tv-viewing time watching good films. I only have about 20 disks as they are so expensive, but you can rent them so I do that lots too. Don't really know what else to say. Write back soon, maybe with some more silly questions?!? Bonjour Jason",

But TV developments and mobiles are going to change that and see a strong movement downmarket. That's a plus for the North.\" </p> <p>In the same way, suggests graphic design e-entrepreneur Peter Harwath, the gizmos of the e-world may appeal to a region where cherished car numberplates have particular appeal. He says: \"There's a lot of bar room talk on the lines of 'My website's bigger than yours' and a tendency for clients to want the latest and most amazing thing.\" </p> <p>Ian Germer of Vodafone conjured up a world of mini-phones with e-facilities small enough to wear as ear-rings \"which your kids will want to have in the playground to show off\". </p> <p>A four-mobile man himself, Mr Germer encountered a nice piece of Northern scepticism, before the evening settled into post-presentation schmooze. \"Anyone who asks Ian a question will get a free baseball cap,\" said the First Tuesday gofer . </p> <p>\"I will,\" said a Yorkshire voice . \"Can he tell us when we can go two miles with our mobiles without being disconnected by signal failure?\" (MW)</p> <p><strong> Manchester</strong><br> It was an eclectic crowd of more than 300 e-entrepreneurs, venture capitalists and computer programmers that squeezed into the fashionable glass-panelled Bar 38 in the heart of Manchester for the inaugural meeting of First Tuesday North. </p> <p>They may not have looked like natural business partners but everyone, without exception, was busy e-mingling, e-networking and cutting e-deals. </p> <p>With similar gatherings in 38 cities across the globe, First Tuesday is devoted to realising the e-commerce dream and the North of England is its latest target. </p> <p>Among the crowd was Alex Allan, the government's newly appointed e-envoy. \"It's fantastic, isn't it?\" he said, looking around the bar which was buzzing with fresh ideas. It is precisely the kind of event Tony Blair has asked him to foster. </p> <p>\"Small businesses used to take a cautious approach to e-commerce,\" he explains. \"Often they would say: 'it's all rather difficult', or 'how will I get the finance?', or 'I'm not sure who the customers are'. But things are transforming now.\" </p> <p>A recent Mori survey showed companies using e-commerce in the North of England jumped from 33% in January last year to 56% in November. </p> <p>There was some worry in the early half of 1999 about whether Britain, and the North of England in particular, was getting left behind while the rest of the world hooked up to the web. But since then the surge in activity and interest has shocked everyone - not least Mr Allan. </p> <p>\"I've just met a firm from Wigan which makes protective gear for Rugby players,\" he said. \"Since they put up their website, they've started getting hits from around the world. They've even had orders by email from as far as Italy and, incredibly, one from Kazakstan.\" </p> <p>None of the e-pioneers in Bar 38 appear to show any of the caution of this time last year as they jostled with each other to pitch their proposals to the venture capitalist (easily identifiable by their red name tags and sensible suits). </p> <p>Jon Keefe, managing director of KMP Internet Solutions, an e-business consultancy firm that employs 24 people at its Stockport headquarters, was bursting with optimism about e-commerce opportunities in the north-west. </p> <p>\"Manchester has a great history in direct mail order marketing,\" he said. \"Companies like Great Universal Stores and J D Williams already have well- established databases and distribution systems. These are fantastic resources for e-commerce. </p> <p>\"We are also finally seeing the gap between hi-tech programming specialists and creative design teams being bridged, which will enable e-business in Britain to really take off.\" </p> <p>Martin Gelles, a partner in Andersen Consulting, who sponsored the event, said that many of the larger London-based firms have moved their e-commerce operations northward. </p> <p>\"A lot of the big players have realised that there is no need to be tied down to a particular place when you are dealing with the web. That's why you have banks, building societies and retail firms setting up in the North where there is a well-trained and flexible workforce.\" </p> <p>Indeed, as Mr Allan points out, geography has become much less of an issue. \"All these new technologies mean that small businesses can set up in, say, the middle of the Lake District and trade right around the world reaching markets that they would never have dreamed of.\" </p> <p>However, as one e-commerce enthusiast rather sheepishly admits, the fact that all these pioneers have travelled from far and wide to gather in one spot is as embarrassing as it is encouraging. </p> <p>\"I suppose you have to ask yourself, if the web is all its cracked up to be, why are these people not meeting in cyberspace? </p> <p>\"The answer, I suppose, is that when it comes to actually doing a deal they still like to meet the person they're going to do business with.\" A similarly sceptical note is struck by Ross Sleight, a marketing and IT consultant based in London. </p> <p>\"I've chosen to base my business in London because, ultimately, that's where the people I want to employ are based. If the government want to draw the big venture capitalists out of London, they will have to invest more in training and infrastructure.\" </p> <p>As with any fledgling industry e-commerce has its teething problems. Mr Allan's evangelising address, for example, was to be web-cast to simultaneous events in Sheffield and Newcastle. But this plan fell victim to technical difficulties. </p> <p>Nevertheless, the burning optimism that has engulfed this emerging industry continues to spread like wild fire across the north-west. Mr Allan, who has been the government's e-envoy for only a month now, is also irrepressibly enthusiastic. </p> <p>\"We are going to set an example in government too,\" he promised. \"We can't tell industry they must be adopting this new technology if they can turn around and say: 'well why can't I access this or that government department on line'. \"There's going to be a lot of work opening up access to government.\" (SB)</p> <p><strong> Edinburgh</strong><br> Just over 200 years ago, Edinburgh was at the centre of the Age of Enlightenment, an intellectual and knowledge revolution that was to lay the foundation stones for Scotland's pre-eminent role in the industrial revolution which, historically-speaking, followed quickly thereafter. </p> <p>However, in the intervening centuries, new nations and sunrise technologies have risen and replaced the iron and steel technologies which built the country's wealth and subsequent economic development as a powerhouse of the industrial world which reached its zenith just before the first world war when the Clyde had the lion's share of world shipbuilding trade. </p> <p>Since then, rampant municipalisation and nationalisation deprived Scotland of much of its entrepreneurial leadership. </p> <p>However, the First Tuesday e-commerce network, which was exported from London north of the border to Edinburgh six months ago, is creating such an e-business fervour, that a new e-biz buzz is engulfing the city. </p> <p>And in true new- technology style, word of email is spreading like online wildfire about the new e-business self-help and networking group. All adherents must consent to sharing email addresses and it operates on a culture of sharing information, ideas and contacts. </p> <p>The first meetings attracted a handful of hard-core adherents-cum-anoraks. Four months later, more than 200 people crowded into the Assembly Rooms in George Street (traditionally a venue for the arts during the international festival) to hear James Oliver, director of a typical e-commerce start-up, lastorders.com (the \"on line off licence\") reveal the secret of the Holy Grail to his followers. </p> <p>\"Just do it,\" he told them. </p> <p>The crowd was a curious mixture of venture capitalists, businesses seeking venture capital funding, people seeking to put together e-commerce teams, and a spate of lawyers touting for business from tomorrow's Bill Gates. </p> <p>In fact, the presence of the lawyers is perhaps the most significant straw in the wind as the city's traditionally reserved and conservative legal establishment gets wired into the potential of online enterprise. Central government is yet to follow. </p> <p>With a barely audible PA system fighting a losing battle with the self-interested and self-seeking e-buzz of budding new businesses clamouring for attention around a handful of venture capitalists like some modern-day Klondykers proclaiming they've found the one true lucky-strike e-gold mine, the atmosphere in the Assembly Rooms was a curious cross between some kind of religious fundamentalist group meeting Gordon Gekko, the avaricious lawyer in the movie Wall Street who decreed: \"Greed is good.\" </p> <p>By the time the fifth First Tuesday meeting was held in the Georgian grandeur of the Royal College of Physicians in the country which produced Baron David Hume and Adam \"Wealth Of Nations\" Smith, big business - in the form of British Energy plc sponsorship - had arrived to proclaim that it had seen the future and that e-business worked. </p> <p>This time, more than 300 devout followers swarmed round Rupert Connolly, managing director of HomeDirectory.com as he preached the Gospel of the First Tuesday-ment, telling how, through the e-commerce self-help group, he was first introduced to his e-venture partners at British Energy, which has consequently taken a \u00a35 million stake in the company. </p> <p>His \"disciples\" listened in devout silence as the nmemonics tripped effortlessly from the PA system (which worked on this occasion). The keys to success in business and e-commerce are straightforward. He said: \"It's KISS - Keep It Simple, Stupid, and remember the seven most important things in business - people, people, people, people, people, people, and product.\" </p> <p>To which worshippers reply with the silent mantra; \"I've gotta e-business plan, I've gotta a hot e-business plan_ it's kinda like Los Angeles, without a sun tan.\" </p> <p>Such has been the success of First Tuesday in developing new businesses and e-commerce in Edinburgh, that it the concept is being re-exported to the other side of the known universe - Glasgow, on March 7 at the Royal Concert Hall.

Central government is yet to follow. With a barely audible PA system fighting a losing battle with the self-interested and self-seeking e-buzz of budding new businesses clamouring for attention around a handful of venture capitalists like some modern-day Klondykers proclaiming they've found the one true lucky-strike e-gold mine, the atmosphere in the Assembly Rooms was a curious cross between some kind of religious fundamentalist group meeting Gordon Gekko, the avaricious lawyer in the movie Wall Street who decreed: \"Greed is good.\" By the time the fifth First Tuesday meeting was held in the Georgian grandeur of the Royal College of Physicians in the country which produced Baron David Hume and Adam \"Wealth Of Nations\" Smith, big business - in the form of British Energy plc sponsorship - had arrived to proclaim that it had seen the future and that e-business worked. This time, more than 300 devout followers swarmed round Rupert Connolly, managing director of HomeDirectory.com as he preached the Gospel of the First Tuesday-ment, telling how, through the e-commerce self-help group, he was first introduced to his e-venture partners at British Energy, which has consequently taken a \u00a35 million stake in the company. His \"disciples\" listened in devout silence as the nmemonics tripped effortlessly from the PA system (which worked on this occasion). The keys to success in business and e-commerce are straightforward. He said: \"It's KISS - Keep It Simple, Stupid, and remember the seven most important things in business - people, people, people, people, people, people, and product.\" To which worshippers reply with the silent mantra; \"I've gotta e-business plan, I've gotta a hot e-business plan_ it's kinda like Los Angeles, without a sun tan.\" Such has been the success of First Tuesday in developing new businesses and e-commerce in Edinburgh, that it the concept is being re-exported to the other side of the known universe - Glasgow, on March 7 at the Royal Concert Hall. Watch this e-space. (JC)",

It was an idyll come true.\" </p> <p>Morris and friends had talked and talked together in that house, and drank good wine, and played hide and seek and thrown apples (from the orchard outside) at each other. Morris once got a black eye. The Hollambys, once they had rectified the \"terrible things\" done to the house by the National Assistance Board, did much the same. In addition to holding architectural brain-storming sessions, they hosted impromptu Communist party meetings, had the Woodcraft Folk camping in the grounds, and held parties and dances galore - but no high heels, the floors were too precious. \"Life was so full and so joyful,\" Hollamby said. \"It was one big adventure.\" Morris would have been delighted. </p> <p>Hollamby was full of wistfulness at the end. \"We came here,\" he told me,\"and we saved this house, saved it. We could remain tenants, but who knows how long we'd stay? Ten, maybe 20 years? But then, I would like to be up there, knowing there'll be no change in the character and the atmosphere...\"</p>",

Sitting opposite a Morris portrait and a Morris aphorism, \"Our Content is Our Best Having\", picked out above the redbrick fireplace, he told me how his and Toms' s wife had worked in the Co-operative Women's Guild, whose founders had once marched behind the great man himself. \"We never lost our enthusiasm,\" he said, echoing Morris's vision of a set-up with Ned and Georgie Burne-Jones. \"It was our joint dream, to live and work together. When Red House came on the market, buying it together seemed a pretty natural thing to do. It was an idyll come true.\" Morris and friends had talked and talked together in that house, and drank good wine, and played hide and seek and thrown apples (from the orchard outside) at each other. Morris once got a black eye. The Hollambys, once they had rectified the \"terrible things\" done to the house by the National Assistance Board, did much the same. In addition to holding architectural brain-storming sessions, they hosted impromptu Communist party meetings, had the Woodcraft Folk camping in the grounds, and held parties and dances galore - but no high heels, the floors were too precious. \"Life was so full and so joyful,\" Hollamby said. \"It was one big adventure.\" Morris would have been delighted. Hollamby was full of wistfulness at the end. \"We came here,\" he told me,\"and we saved this house, saved it. We could remain tenants, but who knows how long we'd stay? Ten, maybe 20 years? But then, I would like to be up there, knowing there'll be no change in the character and the atmosphere...\"",

In 1995 the government finally established a compensation fund, but payments were limited to \u00a34,000 per victim.</p> <p>The chancellor presented his government programme to parliament after easily surviving a confidence vote on Tuesday. He used the opportunity to try to quell foreign concerns that Austria has lurched radically to the right with the entry into government last week of J\u00f6rg Haider's Freedom party.</p> <p>\"Austria is today a stable democracy despite the current demonstrations - radical outbursts which are normal in many other countries but have been as rare in the second republic as major strikes or conflicts with minorities,\" he said.</p> <p>Despite the alliance between his conservative People's party and Mr Haider's party, \"this Austria has not changed in the last few days\", Mr Sch\u00fcssel said. But he acknowledged that the country's Nazi past required \"special vigilance\".</p> <p>He delivered his speech to a parliament whose audience included President Thomas Klestil and former president Kurt Waldheim, who caused consternation in the west 14 years ago when his wartime links to the Nazi SS during the second world war were revealed.</p> <p>The announcement of the appointment of a former president of the Austrian national bank, Maria Schaumayer, to the post of government officer to deal with the compensation claims of forced labourers under the Nazis was an attempt to placate those who say Austria has never properly dealt with its National Socialist history.</p> <p>The appointment of Ms Schaumayer follows the submission at the end of January of a report by a historical commission set up by the last government.</p> <p>The appointment was seen as the \"right step\" by the Green party, but Madeleine Petrovic of the Greens' parliamentary group said yesterday: \"In this government coalition, Schaumayer is really standing on shaky ground.\"</p> <p>In Washington the deputy US treasury secretary, Stuart Eizenstat, told the house of representatives that the way Austria deals with unresolved issues would be an \"important benchmark\" for the future of US-Austrian relations.</p> <p>The Austrian chancellor, in a parliamentary speech lasting more than 90 minutes, presented a programme that in cluded pledges of free-market reforms, budget consolidation and a reduction in bureaucracy. Mr Sch\u00fcssel said Austria was committed to European Union enlargement and wanted to deepen its relations with Nato in hopes of possibly joining the defence alliance one day.</p> <p>In further attempts to win over foreign critics, particularly Austria's 14 EU partners which are reducing contacts with it, the government placed a \u00a333,000 full-page advertisement in Tuesday's International Herald Tribune newspaper.</p> <p>It reproduced a government declaration which President Klestil forced Mr Sch\u00fcssel and Mr Haider to sign last week, stating that Austria was a land of tolerance that recognised its role in crimes of the Nazi era.</p> <p>But adding to criticisms that Mr Haider - despite opting out of taking a position in government - is \"reigning supreme\" from the Austrian state of Carinthia where he is governor, Alexander Van der Bellen, the leader of Austria's Greens, asked why it had been signed \"by the Chancellor and Upper Chancellor\".</p> <p>The head of the opposition Social Democrats in the parliament, Peter Kostelka, said the coalition cabinet was \"a government to be terrified of\".</p> <p>Last night hundreds of people gathered near the parliament building, which has been sealed off by police brought in from around the country.</p> <p>Protesters set up an \"embassy for worried citizens\" in a tent outside the chancellery on Ballhaus Square. The first pro-government demonstration took place outside Vienna's Burgtheater, but only 50 people turned up. The organisers blamed rain.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In an effort to prove to an unconvinced world that Austria is a mature democracy that has conquered its Nazi past, Chancellor Wolfgang Sch\u00fcssel yesterday appointed a government officer to compensate Nazi victims. \"The new government will press [the compensation case] for former slave labourers, who are, after all, at an age at which they need help quickly in order to get justice,\" Mr Sch\u00fcssel said. Unlike Germany, which has paid the equivalent of about \u00a336bn to the Nazis' victims since 1951, Austria avoided paying out any money for decades, claiming it was a victim of the Nazi regime and not a willing collaborator with it. In 1995 the government finally established a compensation fund, but payments were limited to \u00a34,000 per victim. The chancellor presented his government programme to parliament after easily surviving a confidence vote on Tuesday. He used the opportunity to try to quell foreign concerns that Austria has lurched radically to the right with the entry into government last week of J\u00f6rg Haider's Freedom party. \"Austria is today a stable democracy despite the current demonstrations - radical outbursts which are normal in many other countries but have been as rare in the second republic as major strikes or conflicts with minorities,\" he said. Despite the alliance between his conservative People's party and Mr Haider's party, \"this Austria has not changed in the last few days\", Mr Sch\u00fcssel said. But he acknowledged that the country's Nazi past required \"special vigilance\". He delivered his speech to a parliament whose audience included President Thomas Klestil and former president Kurt Waldheim, who caused consternation in the west 14 years ago when his wartime links to the Nazi SS during the second world war were revealed. The announcement of the appointment of a former president of the Austrian national bank, Maria Schaumayer, to the post of government officer to deal with the compensation claims of forced labourers under the Nazis was an attempt to placate those who say Austria has never properly dealt with its National Socialist history. The appointment of Ms Schaumayer follows the submission at the end of January of a report by a historical commission set up by the last government. The appointment was seen as the \"right step\" by the Green party, but Madeleine Petrovic of the Greens' parliamentary group said yesterday: \"In this government coalition, Schaumayer is really standing on shaky ground.\" In Washington the deputy US treasury secretary, Stuart Eizenstat, told the house of representatives that the way Austria deals with unresolved issues would be an \"important benchmark\" for the future of US-Austrian relations. The Austrian chancellor, in a parliamentary speech lasting more than 90 minutes, presented a programme that in cluded pledges of free-market reforms, budget consolidation and a reduction in bureaucracy. Mr Sch\u00fcssel said Austria was committed to European Union enlargement and wanted to deepen its relations with Nato in hopes of possibly joining the defence alliance one day. In further attempts to win over foreign critics, particularly Austria's 14 EU partners which are reducing contacts with it, the government placed a \u00a333,000 full-page advertisement in Tuesday's International Herald Tribune newspaper. It reproduced a government declaration which President Klestil forced Mr Sch\u00fcssel and Mr Haider to sign last week, stating that Austria was a land of tolerance that recognised its role in crimes of the Nazi era. But adding to criticisms that Mr Haider - despite opting out of taking a position in government - is \"reigning supreme\" from the Austrian state of Carinthia where he is governor, Alexander Van der Bellen, the leader of Austria's Greens, asked why it had been signed \"by the Chancellor and Upper Chancellor\". The head of the opposition Social Democrats in the parliament, Peter Kostelka, said the coalition cabinet was \"a government to be terrified of\". Last night hundreds of people gathered near the parliament building, which has been sealed off by police brought in from around the country. Protesters set up an \"embassy for worried citizens\" in a tent outside the chancellery on Ballhaus Square. The first pro-government demonstration took place outside Vienna's Burgtheater, but only 50 people turned up. The organisers blamed rain.",

The sculpted head of a bearded man, dug up in the Toluca valley, 65 miles west of Mexico City in 1933, has been identified as Roman by art experts and dated to the third century AD by a sophisticated new dating technique. When it was originally unearthed, the artefact, only a few centimetres high, was in a burial chamber under three floors which, archaeologists concluded, could not have been sealed earlier than 1510, a decade before the first known European landing in central America. According to Roman Hristov, a US anthropologist, this is the first real proof of human contacts across the Atlantic before the arrival of Columbus in 1492. This week's New Scientist reports that Hristov and a Mexican colleague, Santiago Genov\u00e9s, had read about the head and finally tracked it down, locked in the vaults of a museum in the Mexican capital. The head looks unlike the artwork produced by the native peoples of the region before Columbus. But the notion that it proves Roman contacts with pre-Columbian America will face stiff resistance from hordes of academics in a bitterly contested field. Scientists have suggested that Vikings, Celts and Africans may have crossed the Atlantic before Columbus.

      "body": "<p>Antoine Capella, a singer-songwriter from Angers, wants to replace the bloodthirsty lyrics of the French national anthem, the Marseillaise, with something altogether less aggressive. The existing song, he claims, is \"outrageous\". \"It's fascist,\" he says. \"In this day and age, it's not right.\"</p> <p>If Capella manages to persuade France's national assembly to make the changes - the speaker, Laurent Fabius, is, he says, on his side - out will go: \" March! March! That [their] impure blood may drench our furrows!\" And in will come: \"March! March! That an azure sky may shine on the horizon.\"</p> <p>Will the French make such a change? It seems unlikely, if only because blood is the currency of national anthems: the word is invoked in many of these political hymns. And although national anthems are altered, it tends to happen rarely, and then usually at times of major change.</p> <p>So do the words matter? Like all good hymns, they can be a delight to sing, whether your personal politics are left, right, centre or raving fascist. They are the soundtrack to football matches, concerts, operas, state occasions and the Olympic games. In genuinely friendly international games, national anthems are sung to raise team spirits. The same people who sang these bloodcurdling verses may well be waltzing down streets, rues and strassen arm-in-arm when the game is over.</p> <p>Any of us might sing in our heads or in the bath with tough, even vicious lyrics. This doesn't mean we're about to climb out of our baths and chop our neighbours to pieces with an axe. We just like the sound of lyrics fused with great tunes: \"Mine eyes hath seen the coming of the glory of the Lord/He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored.\" (The Battle Hymn of the American Republic)</p> <p>In any case, does anyone take the words of national anthems to heart? In time of war, yes, but in peace? Maybe, but this is unlikely if you're British, and not a dedicated Orangeman. Most of us find the words and doleful tune of the British national anthem sombre and rather silly.</p> <p>Few know the words to more than the first verse - every bit as xenophobic and bloodthirsty as those of the Marseillaise, but when did you ever hear a band launch into a second verse? The words to the remaining stanzas may be archaic and irrelevant, yet as we never have occasion to sing them, who cares? They haven't meant anything for a very long time, perhaps since they were written - when the British feared invasion by Napoleon.</p> <p>As for the Marseillaise, it was penned, overnight, by Captain Claude-Joseph Rouget de l'Isle in 1792 while his men, from Marseilles, were defending Strasbourg from Prussian forces.

      "bodyText": "Antoine Capella, a singer-songwriter from Angers, wants to replace the bloodthirsty lyrics of the French national anthem, the Marseillaise, with something altogether less aggressive. The existing song, he claims, is \"outrageous\". \"It's fascist,\" he says. \"In this day and age, it's not right.\" If Capella manages to persuade France's national assembly to make the changes - the speaker, Laurent Fabius, is, he says, on his side - out will go: \" March! March! That [their] impure blood may drench our furrows!\" And in will come: \"March! March! That an azure sky may shine on the horizon.\" Will the French make such a change? It seems unlikely, if only because blood is the currency of national anthems: the word is invoked in many of these political hymns. And although national anthems are altered, it tends to happen rarely, and then usually at times of major change. So do the words matter? Like all good hymns, they can be a delight to sing, whether your personal politics are left, right, centre or raving fascist. They are the soundtrack to football matches, concerts, operas, state occasions and the Olympic games. In genuinely friendly international games, national anthems are sung to raise team spirits. The same people who sang these bloodcurdling verses may well be waltzing down streets, rues and strassen arm-in-arm when the game is over. Any of us might sing in our heads or in the bath with tough, even vicious lyrics. This doesn't mean we're about to climb out of our baths and chop our neighbours to pieces with an axe. We just like the sound of lyrics fused with great tunes: \"Mine eyes hath seen the coming of the glory of the Lord/He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored.\" (The Battle Hymn of the American Republic) In any case, does anyone take the words of national anthems to heart? In time of war, yes, but in peace? Maybe, but this is unlikely if you're British, and not a dedicated Orangeman. Most of us find the words and doleful tune of the British national anthem sombre and rather silly. Few know the words to more than the first verse - every bit as xenophobic and bloodthirsty as those of the Marseillaise, but when did you ever hear a band launch into a second verse? The words to the remaining stanzas may be archaic and irrelevant, yet as we never have occasion to sing them, who cares? They haven't meant anything for a very long time, perhaps since they were written - when the British feared invasion by Napoleon. As for the Marseillaise, it was penned, overnight, by Captain Claude-Joseph Rouget de l'Isle in 1792 while his men, from Marseilles, were defending Strasbourg from Prussian forces. What was then known as the War Hymn of the Army of the Rhine was created to help stir French soldiers into action. The words are sung to a swaggering tune. They sounded right in that moving scene in Casablanca when the Germans play Deutschland \u00dcber Alles in Rick's cafe, but the French drown them out with the Marseillaise. Again, in time of war, especially in a war against an enemy bent on genocide and the curtailment of freedom, Captain Rouget de l'Isle's words weren't so very silly after all. The German national anthem, even though the infamous first stanza has now been replaced by the innocuous third which talks of \"brotherliness\" and \"freedom\", will forever be associated with Hitler. As soon as Haydn's air, scored in 1797, stirs into life, we feel our right hands rising in mock salute before pulling them down again. The fact that this was originally the tune for the Austrian anthem (the Germans adopted it in 1922) makes it even more associated in our minds with extreme rightwing politics today, as J\u00f6rg Haider storms to power in Vienna. As for the rest, you can mix and match their lyrics: the words of most are interchangeable. The Irish anthem starts: \" We'll sing a song, a soldier's song .\" And it's not long before we're into the \" cannon's roar and rifle's peal \", while \" out yonder waits the Saxon foe \" . Saxon foe? The words may refer to the English, but there aren't many true-blooded Saxons anywhere between Penzance (Celts, for the most part in Cornwall) and Newcastle-upon-Tyne. (Geordies are descended from Vikings, aren't they?)

On the tip of your tongue . . . match the anthem to the country 1) With glowing hearts we see thee rise, The true north strong and free. 2) From Zambezi to Limpopo, may leaders be exemplary, And may the almighty protect and bless our land. 3) And as we wait the morning's light, Here in the silence of the night, We'll chant a soldier's song. 4) She has wreathed her head, With the helmet of Scipio. Where is Victory? 5) Hasten to battle, men of Bayamo, For the homeland looks proudly to you. You do not fear a glorious death, Because to die for the country is to live. 6) Peace not war shall be our boast, But should foes assail our coast, Make us then a mighty host. 7) O Lord our God arise, Scatter her enemies, And make them fall; Confound their politics, Frustrate their knavish tricks, On Thee our hopes we fix,oh, save us all!

The group - whose shares ended down 1p at 466p last night - has failed to attract much interest from new shareholders despite talk that a de-merger of the company's fast food business, Burger King, is again under consideration. Shares may not quite have hit bottom - they have been as low as 442p over the past 12 months - but John McGrath and his team must have been wondering what on earth they could do to regain its earlier 745p level. After all, the merger between Grand Metropolitan and Guinness was supposed to be delivering such convincing benefits of scale that investors would be killing to buy shares. But with new technology pyrotechnics from the likes of Vodafone, old-style booze and burgers appear distinctly unappealing, even with brands such as Smirnoff, Gordon's Gin, Johnnie Walker, H\u00e4agen-Dazs and Jolly Green Giant canned foods. So yesterday Nick Rose, the group's finance director, said the company was planning a major investment in the internet and web-related strategies, directed mainly at enhancing marketing and advertising campaigns. He said the company has already established an e-procurement system and some small investments in hi-tech venture funds. The company - recognised as a leader in brand management - will also been looking at how it can use the web to enhance brand awareness. \"The internet is rapidly changing the way business is done. Together with our existing marketing department it is fast becoming a powerful tool which will enable the group to enhance total shareholder value,\" Mr Rose said. The group is also looking at business to business strategies to make savings in its supply chain.",

But Eni played down reports that its preferred partner was Spain's Repsol. Eni and Repsol combined would create the world's fifth largest quoted energy conglomerate, with a market capitalisation of around $60.8bn (\u00a338bn). However, executives from both companies yesterday denied reports that a merger was imminent. The Italian oil group has made no secret of its expansionist ambitions. It does not wish to be left behind in the consolidation of the industry, which has already created massive companies such as Exxon Mobil, BP Amoco and the merged Totalfina-Elf Aquitaine - a deal which was given the green light by the European commission yesterday - subject to certain disposals being made. Sources at Totalfina, which had unsuccessful merger talks with Eni last year, said they were surprised by the reports of an Eni-Repsol deal. Industry analysts said that bringing Totalfina and Elf Aquitaine together created a group more capable of striking a deal with Eni. Gian Maria Gros-Pietro, Eni's chairman, said his group was in alliance negotiations but declined to name the potential partner. Repsol said it was looking at possible mergers and alliances with companies in the whole energy sector not just other oil companies, but it was not negotiating with anyone. A spokesman said: \"In that context we have spoken to Eni, but that does not mean we are in negotiations.\" However, speculation about a possible merger deal with Eni lifted Repsol's shares by more than 4% on the Madrid stock exchange and also boosted the prices of other energy groups. Energy analysts had mixed views about a full merger between Eni - which is still 36% owned by the Italian state - and Repsol. Javier Valverde, at Banco Santander Central Hispano, said: \"This merger makes too much sense not to work towards it. Repsol has an eighth of the market capitalisation of Exxon.

Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands and Sweden all spend more than the UN target. Denmark, the most generous OECD country, spends nearly 1% of its annual income on aid. Initial figures for 1999 and 2000 should show Britain's aid spending increasing significantly, however, as the impact of the government's spending review takes effect.",

Gets six-month deferred sentence. </p> <p><strong> 1998</strong> Plays on multi-award winning album The Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill as Latin revival hots up. </p> <p><strong> 1999</strong> Releases album Supernatural. Five million copies sold to date </p> <p> When the American record industry dishes out its annual awards later this month, all eyes at LA's Staples Center will be on Carlos Santana, the 52-year-old guitarist who's been nominated for no fewer than 10 Grammys. That would be a remarkable achievement in any circumstances, but only a year ago Santana was thought of as a 70s throwback with nothing to say to today's listeners. When, that is, he was thought of at all. </p> <p>The album that has reignited his career is Supernatural, a laid-back stew of fashionable Latin rhythms pulled together by Carlos's own distinctive guitar tones. What helped to push it into pop-crossover territory is its list of guest artists. Lauryn Hill wrote and rapped on Do You Like the Way, while Wyclef Jean co-wrote and co-produced Maria Maria. Eagle-Eye Cherry and the Dust Brothers feature on the blues-shuffle Wishing it Was. Writing and vocal contributions from Rob Thomas (of Matchbox 20) helped to lodge Smooth at number one in the singles chart for 12 weeks. Throw in a guest spot from Dave Matthews and an Eric Clapton duet, and you have a recipe that has shifted 5m copies of the album since its release last June. </p> <p>So why has all this happened now? \"That's a good question,\" Carlos says, during a brief visit to Britain. \"I've been saying that most people are not happy unless they're miserable, but when an individual pulls himself out of that zone, he's able to embrace a new dimension of thinking. Most people think life is crap and they have to scream, so they're paranoid. That's why kids in America get guns and shoot each other. But when you realise you have a chance to change the frequency, you start attracting what I'm attracting right now, which is enormous possibilities and opportunities.\" </p> <p>That's not the sort of speech you get from most rock stars, but you can't separate Carlos Santana the musician from Carlos Santana the spiritual being spreading global good vibes. Rock critic Joel Selvin described the Santana of 1970 as \"a guarded personality who tried to exert control through more devious ways\", but today his calm, lilting tones and Tibetan-style skull cap give him the air of an itinerant mystic. He appears to have reached a place where everything is in harmony and nothing happens without a reason. He even saw the creation of Supernatural as a predestined experience, commenting that \"all the people on the album said they had heard my music before I called them, or that I appeared in their dreams, or something\". </p> <p>The downside is that Carlos tends to lapse into beatific hyperbole, notably on Supernatural's sleeve, where he thanks his collaborators a little too profusely. \"Lauryn Hill - To my dearest sister of light. My heart's gratitude for your soul's vision and your heart's music.\" \"Eric Clapton - Dearest brother-friend Eric, you are truly an archangel of the highest order\". And so forth. </p> <p>But Santana has managed to survive the long haul from the Haight-Ashbury dawn of late-60s San Francisco: he is renewing himself when most of his contemporaries are dead or burnt out. If he's found what works for him, who's arguing? \"People have been swinging with this pendulum of good and evil, beautiful or ugly,\" Carlos says. \"Why don't we try this other one that goes like this: beauty, grace, excellence, peace, light, love, joy, quality, harmony. I'm really bored with the last 1,000 years of blaming the devil or blaming this or that for some shit that each person should take responsibility for. On Supernatural the music is working with grandparents, parents, teenagers and kids. It's inviting people to celebrate the divine side of yourself, to validate the existence of something that is paranormal, but is with us all of the time.\" And you thought it was just a pop album. </p> <p>Growing up in the rough-and-tumble Mexican border town of Tijuana, the adolescent Carlos found himself playing the blues in clubs into the early hours, sharing the bill with hookers and strippers. It was probably just as well that his father, also a professional musician, moved the family to San Francisco's Spanish-speaking Mission district in 1961. </p> <p>Carlos was sucked into the creative ferment of the 60s, where the psychedelic underground and anti-Vietnam war protest collided with the new musical directions being pioneered on the West Coast. He was soon rubbing shoulders with local musicians like the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, Moby Grape and the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, and hooked up with organist Gregg Rolie to assemble the first Santana band. With encouragement from San Francisco's influential promoter and entrepreneur Bill Graham, who booked the band at his Fillmore West concert hall and became their unofficial manager, Santana became one of the hottest acts in the Bay area. </p> <p>\"Bill Graham made it possible for the hippies to be educated,\" Carlos says now. \"He said, 'You wanna listen to the Grateful Dead? First hear Miles Davis. If you wanna listen to Santana, first listen to Roland Kirk.' He believed in a balanced meal - salad, vegetables, main course, dessert. He always said that people like Bruce Springsteen and the Police and the Rolling Stones were the steak.\" </p> <p>The bullying, abrasive Graham acted as a self-appointed critic to the artists he booked. He scared a lot of people, but Santana remembers him with fondness. \"What I miss about him is that he took notes at every concert, on everybody - Sinatra, Barbra Streisand, Dylan, Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix. He would show the notes to you at the end of the concert. He would say, 'OK, the first song was excellent, the second really sucked, and the third one was too long.' How many promoters would have the cojones to tell you that? The problem is, you knew he was right. He wasn't into being a promoter or impresario or whatever; he was into the music.\" </p> <p>An appearance at the 1969 Woodstock festival broke Santana nationwide. Maybe the fact that Carlos was tripping on mescaline gave them an extra edge, but the band were one of the major hits of the festival. </p> <p>Carlos's earliest musical idols had been bluesmen like Muddy Waters, Buddy Guy and Otis Rush, but he began to listen to a more diverse palette of sounds. To the basic rock and blues base, Santana added Latin rhythms and the freer shapes of modern jazz, absorbed from records like John Coltrane's My Favourite Things and Miles Davis's rock-jazz fusion, Bitches Brew. </p> <p>\"Miles used to call at my house and he was funnier than anyone I ever heard, man,\" Carlos reminisces. \"He had a tremendous sense of humour. A lot of people saw him as a different kind of angry Black Panther, but with me he was a real sweetheart. On the musical side, he changed the course of music seven times. Stravinsky only did it one time. Even John Coltrane, who's my musician of the century, said, 'Everything I'm discovering, Miles played it already'.\" </p> <p>Santana's first albums - up to and including the fourth, the complex, jazz-inflected Caravanserai of 1972 - were some of the most original and powerful of their time. Carlos's version of his band's history tends to gloss over the power struggles and drug abuse which grew worse with success, until the conflicts drove Carlos to embrace the Hindu teachings of Sri Chinmoy. Between 1973 and 1981 he was known as Devadip Carlos Santana, and embarked on a string of collaborations with similarly spiritual jazz musicians, including John McLaughlin, Stanley Clarke, Wayne Shorter and Herbie Hancock. </p> <p>In the 80s he gradually moved back to his original brew of rock, Latin and blues. \"Jazz is an ocean,\" says Carlos. \"Rock'n'roll is a swimming pool. I hang out on a lake.\" He continued to work regularly, but younger audiences stayed away, and the Santana name began to seem little more than a historical curiosity. </p> <p>Much credit is due, then, to Arista boss Clive Davis, who offered Santana their first recording deal when he was at Columbia in 1968, and laid the groundwork for Carlos's comeback when he offered him a new contract in 1995. Davis asked Carlos what his artistic aspirations were, and was apparently satisfied with the reply: \"I want to unify the molecules with the light through music.\" </p> <p>\"I give everybody all the credit,\" Carlos says. \"I give my wife all the credit, I give Lauryn Hill all the credit for inviting me to appear with her at the Grammys, I give Eric Clapton all the credit for being so gracious and dignified and elegant. I don't need credit, man. I'm into progress, not success. Success is one beautiful cake. You cut it and you eat it yourself, and you choke on it. Progress, you cut it and you feed people with it, and hopefully you save a little piece for yourself. That's where I'm coming from.\" Maybe there's a little of that 1969 flower child left, at that. </p> <p>The Grammys are on February 23.

      "bodyText": "Have moustache, will travel: Santana through the ages 1947 Born in Mexico. Grows up in Tijuana before moving to San Francisco, where he forms the Santana Blues Band. 1968 Santana (as they're now known) play San Francisco's Fillmore ballroom for first time. 1969 Santana take their Latin-influenced music to the hippies at Woodstock. Debut album hits number four. Support Rolling Stones at infamous Altamont concert. 1970 First US hit single is a cover of Fleetwood Mac's Black Magic Woman. Plays Albert Hall and Bath Festival. Abraxas album sells 1m copies. 1971 Santana III top US chart. 1973 Carlos marries Urmila, follower of guru Sri Chinmoy, and makes album with like-minded John McLaughlin. Adds name Devadip. 1976 Plays on Bob Dylan's Rolling Thunder revue and benefit for Hurricane Carter. 1977 Cover of the Zombies' She's Not There is only UK hit. 1985 Band appear on Live Aid in Philadelphia. 1991 Arrested for cannabis possession in Houston. Gets six-month deferred sentence. 1998 Plays on multi-award winning album The Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill as Latin revival hots up. 1999 Releases album Supernatural. Five million copies sold to date When the American record industry dishes out its annual awards later this month, all eyes at LA's Staples Center will be on Carlos Santana, the 52-year-old guitarist who's been nominated for no fewer than 10 Grammys. That would be a remarkable achievement in any circumstances, but only a year ago Santana was thought of as a 70s throwback with nothing to say to today's listeners. When, that is, he was thought of at all. The album that has reignited his career is Supernatural, a laid-back stew of fashionable Latin rhythms pulled together by Carlos's own distinctive guitar tones. What helped to push it into pop-crossover territory is its list of guest artists. Lauryn Hill wrote and rapped on Do You Like the Way, while Wyclef Jean co-wrote and co-produced Maria Maria. Eagle-Eye Cherry and the Dust Brothers feature on the blues-shuffle Wishing it Was. Writing and vocal contributions from Rob Thomas (of Matchbox 20) helped to lodge Smooth at number one in the singles chart for 12 weeks. Throw in a guest spot from Dave Matthews and an Eric Clapton duet, and you have a recipe that has shifted 5m copies of the album since its release last June. So why has all this happened now? \"That's a good question,\" Carlos says, during a brief visit to Britain. \"I've been saying that most people are not happy unless they're miserable, but when an individual pulls himself out of that zone, he's able to embrace a new dimension of thinking. Most people think life is crap and they have to scream, so they're paranoid. That's why kids in America get guns and shoot each other. But when you realise you have a chance to change the frequency, you start attracting what I'm attracting right now, which is enormous possibilities and opportunities.\" That's not the sort of speech you get from most rock stars, but you can't separate Carlos Santana the musician from Carlos Santana the spiritual being spreading global good vibes. Rock critic Joel Selvin described the Santana of 1970 as \"a guarded personality who tried to exert control through more devious ways\", but today his calm, lilting tones and Tibetan-style skull cap give him the air of an itinerant mystic. He appears to have reached a place where everything is in harmony and nothing happens without a reason. He even saw the creation of Supernatural as a predestined experience, commenting that \"all the people on the album said they had heard my music before I called them, or that I appeared in their dreams, or something\". The downside is that Carlos tends to lapse into beatific hyperbole, notably on Supernatural's sleeve, where he thanks his collaborators a little too profusely. \"Lauryn Hill - To my dearest sister of light. My heart's gratitude for your soul's vision and your heart's music.\" \"Eric Clapton - Dearest brother-friend Eric, you are truly an archangel of the highest order\". And so forth. But Santana has managed to survive the long haul from the Haight-Ashbury dawn of late-60s San Francisco: he is renewing himself when most of his contemporaries are dead or burnt out. If he's found what works for him, who's arguing? \"People have been swinging with this pendulum of good and evil, beautiful or ugly,\" Carlos says. \"Why don't we try this other one that goes like this: beauty, grace, excellence, peace, light, love, joy, quality, harmony. I'm really bored with the last 1,000 years of blaming the devil or blaming this or that for some shit that each person should take responsibility for. On Supernatural the music is working with grandparents, parents, teenagers and kids. It's inviting people to celebrate the divine side of yourself, to validate the existence of something that is paranormal, but is with us all of the time.\" And you thought it was just a pop album. Growing up in the rough-and-tumble Mexican border town of Tijuana, the adolescent Carlos found himself playing the blues in clubs into the early hours, sharing the bill with hookers and strippers. It was probably just as well that his father, also a professional musician, moved the family to San Francisco's Spanish-speaking Mission district in 1961. Carlos was sucked into the creative ferment of the 60s, where the psychedelic underground and anti-Vietnam war protest collided with the new musical directions being pioneered on the West Coast. He was soon rubbing shoulders with local musicians like the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, Moby Grape and the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, and hooked up with organist Gregg Rolie to assemble the first Santana band. With encouragement from San Francisco's influential promoter and entrepreneur Bill Graham, who booked the band at his Fillmore West concert hall and became their unofficial manager, Santana became one of the hottest acts in the Bay area. \"Bill Graham made it possible for the hippies to be educated,\" Carlos says now. \"He said, 'You wanna listen to the Grateful Dead? First hear Miles Davis. If you wanna listen to Santana, first listen to Roland Kirk.' He believed in a balanced meal - salad, vegetables, main course, dessert. He always said that people like Bruce Springsteen and the Police and the Rolling Stones were the steak.\" The bullying, abrasive Graham acted as a self-appointed critic to the artists he booked. He scared a lot of people, but Santana remembers him with fondness. \"What I miss about him is that he took notes at every concert, on everybody - Sinatra, Barbra Streisand, Dylan, Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix. He would show the notes to you at the end of the concert. He would say, 'OK, the first song was excellent, the second really sucked, and the third one was too long.' How many promoters would have the cojones to tell you that? The problem is, you knew he was right. He wasn't into being a promoter or impresario or whatever; he was into the music.\" An appearance at the 1969 Woodstock festival broke Santana nationwide. Maybe the fact that Carlos was tripping on mescaline gave them an extra edge, but the band were one of the major hits of the festival. Carlos's earliest musical idols had been bluesmen like Muddy Waters, Buddy Guy and Otis Rush, but he began to listen to a more diverse palette of sounds. To the basic rock and blues base, Santana added Latin rhythms and the freer shapes of modern jazz, absorbed from records like John Coltrane's My Favourite Things and Miles Davis's rock-jazz fusion, Bitches Brew. \"Miles used to call at my house and he was funnier than anyone I ever heard, man,\" Carlos reminisces. \"He had a tremendous sense of humour. A lot of people saw him as a different kind of angry Black Panther, but with me he was a real sweetheart. On the musical side, he changed the course of music seven times. Stravinsky only did it one time. Even John Coltrane, who's my musician of the century, said, 'Everything I'm discovering, Miles played it already'.\" Santana's first albums - up to and including the fourth, the complex, jazz-inflected Caravanserai of 1972 - were some of the most original and powerful of their time. Carlos's version of his band's history tends to gloss over the power struggles and drug abuse which grew worse with success, until the conflicts drove Carlos to embrace the Hindu teachings of Sri Chinmoy. Between 1973 and 1981 he was known as Devadip Carlos Santana, and embarked on a string of collaborations with similarly spiritual jazz musicians, including John McLaughlin, Stanley Clarke, Wayne Shorter and Herbie Hancock. In the 80s he gradually moved back to his original brew of rock, Latin and blues. \"Jazz is an ocean,\" says Carlos. \"Rock'n'roll is a swimming pool.

Much credit is due, then, to Arista boss Clive Davis, who offered Santana their first recording deal when he was at Columbia in 1968, and laid the groundwork for Carlos's comeback when he offered him a new contract in 1995.

Go in closer and you hear different stories told in many accents: \"It seemed to have wings like a bat and came stumbling towards us. We didn't wait to investigate...\"; \"My friend and I were walking in the countryside when we saw three tiny figures...\" The voices, Hiller explains, belong to witnesses relating encounters with alien visitors. </p> <p>Susan Hiller is an artist who makes collections. Her art is curatorial in that it assembles, preserves and documents. What she collects are what she calls \"cultural artefacts\", from old seaside postcards to recordings of alien encounters and, in the exhibition Dream Machines which she has selected and which has just opened at Dundee Contemporary Arts, the work of other artists who, like her, are fascinated by altered states of consciousness. </p> <p>\"We're all collectors,\" Hiller tells me. She is sitting amid old projectors, Mr Punch puppets, paintings - she has been known to burn her paintings and exhibit the ash - and relics from a synagogue wrapped in brown-paper parcels. \"We're collectors and sorters and archivists. This is what we are as people, this is how we make sense of everything, and I suppose this exhibition is made up of a large number of artworks that I've collected mentally, but never had a chance to bring together in one place. They existed in my own mental museum.\" </p> <p>Dream Machines is an exhibition that looks at contemporary art like an anthropologist exploring another culture. Famous artists are held up as case histories, and works normally exhibited as fine art are displayed as experiments in what drugs, drink, dreams and even death can make you feel. Drunkenness in two cultures can be compared by watching a 1972 Gilbert and George video called Gordons Makes Us Drunk and then seeing Mexican artist Minerva Cuevas drink an entire bottle of tequila until she becomes totally incoherent. Gordons or tequila - they do something to your mind. So do the magic mushrooms German artist Carsten H\u00f6ller consumes in a hotel room, and the poetry in a video in which the British artist Mark Francis reads Baudelaire to cannabis plants. </p> <p>It's this desire to create an effect, to make you feel something, that distinguishes the art of Susan Hiller. American-born but based in Britain since the early 70s, Hiller has become one of our most influential and revered artists. She even has a room to herself in the opening displays at Tate Modern. The reason for her huge reputation among critics, curators and other artists is that she has asserted things about art that, until quite recently, were forgotten: that it can access the unconscious; that, as she says of Dream Machines, the most hard-headed conceptual artist secretly wants to be a \"visionary\". </p> <p>Yet Hiller's prestige among artists has never translated into public celebrity, perhaps because she just doesn't conform to any of the things that sell artists. As one young British artist featured in her show pointed out, it's absurd that such a significant figure now falls outside the age limit for the Turner Prize. Hiller is an intellectual, a graduate student in anthropology before she gave it up to become an artist. She's written a book about Primitivism in art and co-authored a cultural history of dreams. Her celebrated installation From The Freud Museum sounds like a treatise. In Britain, with its lingering anti-intellectual prejudices, that just about writes her off as an art star. Even worse, she is widely respected as a teacher. </p> <p>Hiller was born in 1942 and grew up in Cleveland, Ohio. \"I always wanted to be an artist,\" she says, \"but I had never heard of any women artists and when I did hear of them they were all second-rate. I went to art classes at the Cleveland Art Museum and then at a certain point went off to university and decided not to be an artist, although the reasons were not clear to me. I went to graduate school in anthropology because it fascinated me. I was primarily interested in things like African art; but also, looking back, I can see that the first generation of really famous anthropologists in the US consisted of a great many women.\" </p> <p>At a precise point in her graduate career - she remembers suddenly starting to draw rather than take notes in a lecture - she abandoned her plan to be the next Margaret Mead and became an artist instead. It's almost out of Henry James, her flight from American intellectualism to have fun abroad. \"Six months later I left and came to Europe - which was a classic way of escaping. What I didn't realise at the time about this interest in African and Native American artefacts was that it was a kind of modernist entry into art - Picasso - the lure of the unknown, which nowadays we see through as a form of exoticism, with its colonialist aspects. But nevertheless there is a very sincere and genuine visual charge which you get from these works which are so unfamiliar.\" </p> <p>What is brilliant and original about Susan Hiller is the way she has turned her anthropological eye on to what is familiar. She collects the artefacts of our culture and makes us see them as utterly strange. As an American in London she has a slight displacement that helps her to see how weird we really are. One of the objects in her Freud Museum installation is a jug in the shape of a cow, which has a personal meaning because, she remembers, she had never heard a woman called a cow before coming to this country. Perhaps her most \"British\" piece is An Entertainment, a video installation that takes Punch and Judy and reveals the savage, primitive violence at the heart of this seaside theatre. \"When you start to look at anything and think about it, tremendous meanings start to unravel. Of course we couldn't live like that - we couldn't live thinking about everything or we'd never be able to survive. But art can slow you down enough to think about those things.\" </p> <p>Hiller's art seems increasingly about the unconscious of our culture, the margins of the collective psyche, as recorded in UFO reports and horror films. Her recent video installations Wild Talents and Psi Girls delve into the world of psychic phenomena, and the exhibition Dream Machines comes clean about her addiction to the unconscious. You might say this urge to unveil the world of dreams makes her a successor to the surrealists; but Hiller believes surrealism has totally crippled the way artists think about dreams. Hiller characterises western culture as \"the Freud museum\". She wants to get away from what she calls the \"crisp paintings\" of Dali and their Freudian assumption that dreams can be translated into words. The art in Dream Machines is far harder to describe: the altered states it evokes are intended to be inexplicable. </p> <p>What she is trying to do in Dream Machines, says Hiller, is to make the viewer experience what a painting by Dali only describes. Art can actually change the way you think and feel. The artists in Dream Machines do this in various ways. They trick you with light, like James Turrell, whose art disrupts our perception with hidden light sources that seem to make space tangible. They mesmerise you, like Gilbert and George repeating their mantra \"Gordons makes us very drunk\". Or, in the case of Kurt Schwitters reading his Dadaist sound poem The Primeval Sonata on a 20s gramophone record, they reduce you to paroxysms of laughter. </p> <p>\"The primary altered state of consciousness that we're all familiar with is dreaming,\" says Hiller over nothing stronger than a cup of tea. \"Others are slightly more rarefied: hypnosis, hallucination, induced by drugs or trance states of various kinds. Everything in the show is intended to provoke you into an effect.\" </p> <p>Booze, drugs and weird machines feature in Hiller's exhibition but at its core are artworks that transport you to another state of mind by the power of imagination. Douglas Gordon's installation 30 Seconds Text takes you into a totally darkened room where you feel disoriented. A lightbulb flashes on. There's a text on the wall telling how a doctor attempted to talk to a man's head after it had just been cut off by the guillotine. The head could communicate for 25-30 seconds, relates Gordon - exactly the time, he concludes, it should have taken you to read this. The light cuts off. You're in total darkness. It would be fair to say Susan Hiller wants to mess with your head. </p> <p>Dream Machines is at Dundee Contemporary Arts (01382 432000) till March 26, then at Mappin Art Gallery, Sheffield, from July 8-August 20, and at Camden Arts Centre, London NW1, from September 7-October 29.</p>",

If it isn't a major work, then Sequenza XIII, for solo bassoon, in which Pascal Gallois repeated his tour de force of appearing not to breathe conventionally for almost 20 minutes, certainly is.

The tip-tilted bowler hat held between thumb and forefinger, the jutting buttocks, the hand raised high: all these are much in evidence in this rousing anthology of his work ranging from Kiss me Kate and The Pajama Game to the movie All That Jazz. </p> <p>For me, the best of Fosse often lies in the vintage setpieces from book musicals, where his irony and wit match that of the score. Here, for instance, we get two classics from Sweet Charity. In Big Spender the lewd hip movements of the taxi-dancers who drape their legs over the railing as if they were folding Dali clocks evoke a world of sleazy sex. Rich Man's Frug, in which smooth men dance with cigarettes poised in parodic Coward style, also summons up a kind of yuppie ecstasy. </p> <p>Obviously in a show that includes so much you sense Fosse's limitations as well as his brilliance. He did not come from the world of classical ballet and his occasional nods in that direction reveal his fundamental lack of lyricism. He could also occasionally be pretentious. But his best work has an extraordinary mix of muscularity, sexiness and energy. </p> <p>The climax to the evening, from his exuberant 1978 show Dancin', is a version of Benny Goodman's Sing, Sing, Sing in which the movements match those of the instruments: one particular dancer, Emma Tunmore, doesn't so much accompany the trumpet solo as make music visible with her mane-tossing head movements, her pelvic gyrations and her breathtaking floor-slide. In fact, one great virtue of the show, directed by Richard Maltby Jr and Ann Reinking and co-choreographed by Reinking and Chet Walker, is that the dancers emerge as individuals. They are, I note, predominantly British, which says a lot for the way we can now match American showbusiness expertise. </p> <p>In most musicals you sit patiently waiting for the few patches of choreographed excitement. Here you get the ecstasy without the boredom. </p> <p> Until June 17. Box office: 0171-839 5972. This review appeared in some editions of yesterday's paper </p>",

For me, the best of Fosse often lies in the vintage setpieces from book musicals, where his irony and wit match that of the score. Here, for instance, we get two classics from Sweet Charity. In Big Spender the lewd hip movements of the taxi-dancers who drape their legs over the railing as if they were folding Dali clocks evoke a world of sleazy sex. Rich Man's Frug, in which smooth men dance with cigarettes poised in parodic Coward style, also summons up a kind of yuppie ecstasy. Obviously in a show that includes so much you sense Fosse's limitations as well as his brilliance. He did not come from the world of classical ballet and his occasional nods in that direction reveal his fundamental lack of lyricism. He could also occasionally be pretentious. But his best work has an extraordinary mix of muscularity, sexiness and energy. The climax to the evening, from his exuberant 1978 show Dancin', is a version of Benny Goodman's Sing, Sing, Sing in which the movements match those of the instruments: one particular dancer, Emma Tunmore, doesn't so much accompany the trumpet solo as make music visible with her mane-tossing head movements, her pelvic gyrations and her breathtaking floor-slide. In fact, one great virtue of the show, directed by Richard Maltby Jr and Ann Reinking and co-choreographed by Reinking and Chet Walker, is that the dancers emerge as individuals. They are, I note, predominantly British, which says a lot for the way we can now match American showbusiness expertise. In most musicals you sit patiently waiting for the few patches of choreographed excitement. Here you get the ecstasy without the boredom. Until June 17. Box office: 0171-839 5972.

The deal will make tax free betting through Sports Internet's Guernsey based subsidiary Surrey Group available to Freeserve's 1.7m users from March. Analysts expect the move to put further pressure on traditional bookmakers who fear their market share will be hit by the industry exodus offshore to escape the government's 9% levy on bets. Racecourse operator Arena Leisure has unveiled a joint venture with American betting technology group Autotote to operate an internet betting service for horseracing around the world. Sports Internet is cementing its relationship with Freeserve by issuing it a warrant to subscribe 400,000 new shares at 750p each, representing a potential investment of \u00a33m. The deal reunites Freeserve chief executive John Pluthero and Sports Internet deputy chairman Peter Wilkinson, who together played a crucial role in creating Freeserve. A Freeserve spokesman said it had been particularly attracted by the optasoccer.com football statistics website. Sports Internet chief executive Jeremy Fenn said the company was actively looking at ways to expand into horseracing and golf. He dismissed speculation that BSkyB and NTL were battling to join Freeserve as shareholders in the company. \"There is nothing on the table at this time,\" he said. Freeserve shares edged back 4p at 775p, but Sports Internet climbed 42p to 800p.",
