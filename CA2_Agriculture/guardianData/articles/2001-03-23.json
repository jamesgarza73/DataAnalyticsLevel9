      "body": "<p><strong>Keeping the Faith</strong><br>Rental and DVD rental<br>Buena Vista<br>Cert 12<br>Rating: *** </p> <p>A romantic comedy with an IQ, which already makes it a bit of a rarity. Edward Norton and Ben Stiller are the boyhood friends who grow up to be a Catholic priest and a rabbi in New York. Jenna Elfman is the childhood friend turned high-powered businesswoman who causes emotional chaos during a visit. Keeping the Faith benefits from a smart and eccentric script by Stuart Blumberg, a debutant in director Norton, and good pacing and timing from its reliable leads. It feels like friends having fun together and letting us in on the joke. It also shows a fond regard for New York's great ethnic diversity - the plot unfolds as a drunk Norton's confession to a barman who turns out to be a Sikh Catholic Muslim with Jewish in-laws. In one of the film's most warmly funny scenes, Stiller imports a black choir into his synagogue in despair at the standard of the congregation's singing. Norton and Stiller treat preaching as a form of stand-up comedy while they consider a joint Jewish and Irish religious centre. Phrases like \"kosher nostra\" get flung around and for an hour or so, this is a breath of fresh air in the rather fetid ambience we call rom-com. So it's a big disappointment when Norton allows it a very orthodox (if not Orthodox) ending. </p> <p><strong> Dancer in the Dark</strong><br>VCI/FilmFour Retail and DVD<br>(\u00a319.99)<br>Cert 15<br>Rating: ** </p> <p>Perhaps the most controversial Cannes winner ever - the announcement that it had won the Golden Palm was met with a storm of booing - and it's easy to see why. In the first place, Lars von Trier's Dogme style (wobbly camerawork and apparent improvisation) is all wrong for a musical. In the second, our heroine, Bj\u00f6rk, has to fight against the kind of manipulative plotting you thought had gone out with weepies in the silent cinema era. She's going blind, her son's going blind and she is horribly mistreated by people she thought were her friends. Director von Trier pulled off the greatest heartbreaker of the last decade in Breaking the Waves, which makes you wonder how he could get it so spectacularly wrong here. If we are supposed to be sobbing at the plight of our plucky heroine trapped in Robin Day specs and big Pauline Fowler cardigans, the natural reaction is to laugh at the Danish director's outrageous manipulation, Dickensian sentimentality and careless plotting. \"In a musical, nothing dreadful ever happens,\" says Ms Gudmundsdottir. In this one, it's all so dreadful you wonder if the enigmatic director is having a joke at our expense, especially in the shock ending. It's especially a shame for Bj\u00f6rk, (who has showed she can dominate a camera with no props in the video for Big Time Sensuality and did her own little mini-musical in It's Oh So Quiet) and for Catherine Deneuve, once the star of a stylish musical, The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, and here lumbered with a ludicrous best friend/fairy godmother role. For incongruous musical numbers, stick to Always Look on the Bright Side of Life, which, come to think of it, would have worked rather well with the finale here. </p> <p><strong> Freeway II</strong><br>Rental High Fliers<br>Cert 18<br>Rating: *** </p> <p>Aka Confessions of a Trickbaby. Gleefully trashy and outrageous road movie in which Crystal (armed robber, sexual psychopath, drug dealer, car thief and bulimic daughter of a crack addict) busts out of prison with Cyclona (just your basic delusional serial killer lesbian). They hit the road and make for Tijuana to see Cyclona's favourite nun, Sister Gomez. Crystal is played by the magisterially stroppy Natasha Lyonne and Sister Gomez, surprisingly turns out to be the great lost auteur Vincent Gallo. John Landis also turns up as a judge. Huge amounts of violence and throwing up ensue and it's sporadically very funny. Stylistically, this is like a Roger Corman 1970s exploitation film, or a twisted sister to Gregg Araki's recent trilogy of doomed kids. It's \"based on Hansel and Gretel\" (as the bloody Freeway, starring Reese Witherspoon, was based on Little Red Riding Hood) but only a contracts lawyer could spot the similarity. Good original soundtrack too: Surf Trio and Veruca Salt, we salute you.</p>",

Even before they became a group with a terrible name, their every move was under debate. As 3,000 hopefuls were ruthlessly - and amusingly - whittled down to five lucky victims, the personalities behind the pop dream came under scrutiny. Kym and her kids! Noel and his mum! Suzanne and her unwise hair extensions! And after the TV show, the makeovers and the freakish dolls, here, finally, is the music. </p> <p>The single Pure &amp; Simple is already at number one with its sultry, All-Saints-meets-Oasis-in-Top-Shop charm, and rightly so. It's a great pop song and would have been a success regardless of who had recorded it (word has it that Posh Spice was lined up for the honour). Unfortunately, it's entirely unreflective of the rest of the Popstars album. While Pure &amp; Simple is an up-to-date take on the classic Motown style, Hear'Say have looked to the days of Stock, Aitken and Waterman as inspiration for most of this debut. Popstars couldn't be more indicative of the late 1980s if it came as a picture disc with Grolsch bottle-tops for your Doc Martens. </p> <p>This is a place where the boys are sweet, while the girls - Kym Marsh, Myleene Klass and Suzanne - pick and choose who they want to play with. Poor old Noel Sullivan and Danny Foster don't get much of a look-in: occasionally they're allowed a duet and they're humoured with a lot of harmonies, but essentially this is a girl's world, and a world where only one girl is really allowed to be a pop princess. That's Marsh. </p> <p>Marsh's vocals smother almost all of the mid-tempo songs and drown out everyone else involved. It's strange that such pains were taken to form a group, when only one singer is really allowed to shine. The producers who have put this ultra-slick album together obviously see something in Marsh's voice that goes straight over my head. She has a good range, but she's too much of a cruise-liner diva. Her bland, mannered vocals on Another Lover put a smiley face on a confusing tale of love and heartbreak, while Carried Away has her crooning about her faith on an overblown ballad that's sickly sweet. On Not That Kind, Marsh is Kylie Minogue to Foster's Jason Donovan; the pair play musical footsie to a fun-in-the-sun sound taken from Janet Jackson's The Best Things in Life Are Free. \"It's good when we're together, but it's hard when we're apart,\" they sing. The same could be said for their album. </p> <p>Three tracks in particular are just horrible. Colourblind, a utopian vision of life where love is all that counts, has a worthy sentiment, but the track, one of the few that breaks a sweat, is too fast for the vocals. The group sound like they're trying to keep up with the beat, and a melodic guitar rhythm struggles to make itself heard. There's a \"Why bother?\" element to the brief version of the Mama's and the Papa's classic Monday Monday, which manages to lose the atmospheric weariness of the original thanks to the stage-school pronunciation of every word. What was once light and airy becomes a leaden and cold karaoke interpretation. And then there's Bridge Over Troubled Water, which showcases Hear'Say's gift for tight harmonies, but should have remained the group's personal warm-up mantra rather than becoming an album track. </p> <p>The nice moments on Popstars come wrapped in Backstreet Boys stylings. Breath and I Didn't Want You Anyway are sassy, classy slices of pop, while Make It Happen has more of a club feel, thankfully resigning Marsh to backing vocals as it sways its hips to the disco beat. Best of all is One, with the squelchy keyboards and bass from Stevie Wonders's Superstitious adding some funk to the \"All I need is somebody, someone who'll be getting down at my party\" refrain. It's the only time Hear'Say try something a bit different and it's great, the key change in the middle of the song adding a bit of sauce to the proceedings. </p> <p>Having survived Nasty Nigel's comments to win a place in the public's affections, Hear'Say should find life in the pop jungle simple, and Popstars is destined to be a massive success. It's just a shame it couldn't be great on its own merits too. </p> <p>\u0095 To hear this CD, call 09068 626828 and use code 1241*. To buy it, call Guardian CultureShop on 0800 3166 102.</p>",

There's a \"Why bother?\" element to the brief version of the Mama's and the Papa's classic Monday Monday, which manages to lose the atmospheric weariness of the original thanks to the stage-school pronunciation of every word. What was once light and airy becomes a leaden and cold karaoke interpretation. And then there's Bridge Over Troubled Water, which showcases Hear'Say's gift for tight harmonies, but should have remained the group's personal warm-up mantra rather than becoming an album track. The nice moments on Popstars come wrapped in Backstreet Boys stylings. Breath and I Didn't Want You Anyway are sassy, classy slices of pop, while Make It Happen has more of a club feel, thankfully resigning Marsh to backing vocals as it sways its hips to the disco beat. Best of all is One, with the squelchy keyboards and bass from Stevie Wonders's Superstitious adding some funk to the \"All I need is somebody, someone who'll be getting down at my party\" refrain. It's the only time Hear'Say try something a bit different and it's great, the key change in the middle of the song adding a bit of sauce to the proceedings. Having survived Nasty Nigel's comments to win a place in the public's affections, Hear'Say should find life in the pop jungle simple, and Popstars is destined to be a massive success. It's just a shame it couldn't be great on its own merits too. \u0095 To hear this CD, call 09068 626828 and use code 1241*. To buy it, call Guardian CultureShop on 0800 3166 102.",

He kept returning to the form throughout his life, and the sequence of 90 miniatures faithfully charts the evolution of his musical language from its Chopinesque beginnings in the set of 24 Preludes Op 11, composed in the early 1890s to the rarefied harmonic experiments of his final years, when he abandoned key signatures altogether. </p> <p>Unfortunately, though, Piers Lane is not the ideal pianist for such a survey; his robust, rather over-insistent playing lacks the necessary delicacy and suggestiveness to make the most of what are sometimes almost evanescent inventions, while his limited range of keyboard colour is insufficient to realise all of Scriabin's endlessly imaginative textures. Music that should glisten in an array of ever-changing hues becomes persistently monochrome. </p> <p><strong> Ravel: Cantates de Rome - Myrrha, Alcyone, Alyssa </strong><br>Gens/Delunsch/Amsellem/ Beuron/Uria-Monzon/Groves/Tezier/Barrard/Orchestre Capitole de Toulouse/Plasson (EMI)<br>Rating: ****<br>\u00a314.99 </p> <p> Ravel's repeated failure to win the Prix de Rome, the most coveted prize for young composers in France at the turn of the 20th century, has become part of musical folklore. In four successive years from 1900 to 1903 he entered the competition, which required candidates to jump through a series of academic hoops before finally composing a cantata on a prescribed text. On the first occasion Ravel did not even reach the final stages, but after that he did at least get as far as writing the required cantatas in which he tried desperately to conform to the academic norms expected. But he still failed to convince the jury (which included Massenet and Saint-Sa\u00ebns) that he deserved the prize. </p> <p>The cantatas have hardly been heard since, and this collection, which contains some wonderfully refined singing and playing, is certainly a fascinating curiosity, but it only very rarely sounds like the Ravel we know. It must have been hard for a composer of his discrimination to respond positively to texts as leaden and arch as these. </p> <p><strong> English String Miniatures: works by Elgar, Bridge, Wood, Ireland, Delius, Warlock, Bush, Vaughan Williams </strong><br>English Northern Philharmonia/Lloyd-Jones (Naxos)<br>Rating: ***<br>\u00a314.99 </p> <p> The tendrils of David Lloyd-Jones's English-music survey with the English Northern Philharmonia - the orchestra of Opera North in its concert-hall incarnation - spread far and wide. This is their second collection of small-scale character sketches for string orchestra, to go alongside their hugely impressive cycles of Bax and Bliss that are already well under way. With the exceptions of Elgar's Sospiri, and Frank Bridge's arrangement of Sir Roger de Coverley, nothing here is really well known - there are two more Bridge's folk-tune re-workings, a three-movement Fantasy-Concerto by Haydn Wood, Vaughan Williams' Charterhouse Suite, Delius's Air and Dance, and Peter Warlock's 60th-birthday tribute to him, as well as Geoffrey Bush's Consort Music. None of it is going to set the world ablaze, and in truth one or two pieces are rather bland, but everything is played with real affection and expertise. </p> <p><strong> Vaughan Williams: Symphonies 8 &amp; 9 </strong><br>London Philharmonic/ Haitink (EMI)<br>Rating: ****<br>\u00a315.99 </p> <p> Bernard Haitink ends his survey of Vaughan Williams's symphonies with the last and least performed works in the cycle. Both are products of the 1950s, when Vaughan Williams was in his 80s, and they generally recapitulate much of what he had explored in the previous half-century. Yet there are innovations, especially in the Eighth, where the array of tuned percussion in the orchestra adds a new aura to his scoring in the outer movements, while in the Ninth, the inclusion of three saxophones and an important part for a solo flugelhorn gives the work a special, rather autumnal flavour. The generally reflective mood of both pieces suites Haitink very well - his account of the third movement of the Eighth, for strings only, is raptly elegiac, and he relishes the sombre scoring and sometimes elusive meaning of the Ninth too, without ever neglecting the firm bone-structure that underpins it. </p> <p>\u0095 To order any CD call Guardian CultureShop on 0800 3166 102.</p>",

As a cycle it is as consistently revelatory in its own way as the previous landmark versions by Haitink, Bernstein and Tennstedt were in their own eras. Chailly's ability to combine total structural integrity with a marvellous sense of the music's inner drama is really put to the test in the two huge panels of the Eighth, the first a setting of the medieval hymn Veni Creator Spiritus, the second built upon the last scene of Goethe's Faust. </p> <p>Chailly welds them together unhesitatingly, demonstrating that they make a totally complementary pair: the celebratory assertiveness of the first part, with its busy polyphony and intricate double fugue, is answered by the ever more rarefied spirituality of the second. He is as assured in his handling of the great outbursts of the opening - every strand clear every counterpoint perfectly weighted - as he is in the much more pictorial second, when the refinement of the Concertgebouw playing really comes into its own, with every scene painted in its own distinct instrumental hue. </p> <p>With a superb line-up of singers, led by Jane Eaglen's Magna Peccatrix, with Ben Heppner's Doctor Marianus and Peter Mattei's Pater Ecstaticus, this is a performance of totally consistent theatricality. </p> <p>Alongside such galvanised singing and playing Seiji Ozawa's account of Mahler's Second, the Resurrection Symphony, seems very tame indeed. Technically the instrumental contribution is first rate - the Seito Keinen Orchestra is a truly international-class band, though lacking any special character of its own, but Ozawa is unable to imprint any character upon it or indeed to inject any kind of drama into what is arguably the most apocalyptic of all symphonies. The first movement simply goes through its rhetorical motions, hardly hinting at any of the numinous grandeur that should come; the central movements are bland to the point of anonymity; the final vocal movements lack any kind of conviction. </p> <p>The disappointments of Pierre Boulez's Das Lied von der Erde are not so obvious, but no less critical. Boulez's Mahler cycle for Deutsche Grammophon has been patchy thing, only occasionally catching fire, and this is one of the instalments in which the vital spark deserts him, though as expected he is masterly in the way in which he realises every fleck and thread of the orchestral tapestry, unfolding the final Abschied with cool assurance and the considerable bonus of the Cleveland Orchestra's ravishing playing, but none of the movements is sufficiently characterised, and the soloists lack sufficient personality to impose that extra dimension themselves. The mezzo-soprano Violetta Urmana is a fine singer, and her first appearance in the work Der Einsame im Herbst is the high point of the performance, but the tenor Michael Schade is really out of his depth in a role requiring a voice of real heroic quality combined with the perceptions of a lieder singer. All he can produce is a small-scale, rather wheedling sound that is totally inappropriate here.

      "body": "<p><strong> Talvin Singh</strong><br>Ha (Universal/Island)<br>Rating: **<br>\u00a315.99 </p> <p>Leytonstone-born Talvin Singh calls himself The Cultural Nomad; Ha, the follow-up to 1998's Mercury music prize-winning OK, was recorded in studios across the globe, from Madras and Bombay to London. Even so, Ha is no stylistically varied tour de force. Instead of a violent collision of opposites to make sparks fly you get a collage effect, all pretty patterns and curlicues. Or, to put it another way, Ha offers less friction than fusion, a puree so smooth you can barely taste it. Both extremes of Singh's musical spectrum are compromised here. Depending on your vantage point, either the drum'n'bass and electro-funk rhythms are smothered by traditional instruments such as sarengi, tablas and Indian harp, or one's enjoyment of the latter is ruined by the intrusion of the former. Ha might well prove educational, and certainly it is Singh's prerogative to provide a showcase for his heritage, but that doesn't mean it's any good. (PL) </p> <p><strong> Rothko</strong><br>In the Pulse of an Artery (Bella Union)<br>Rating: ***<br>\u00a38.99 </p> <p>London band Rothko are the first rock outfit to be comprised of three bassists - Jon Meade, Crawford Blair and Mark Beazley. They are aided and abetted on their third album by Simon Raymonde (ex-Cocteau Twins), who produced and engineered, sings (in a low murmur) and plays sitar on Imprint of Leaves. Considering the limited number of instruments, Rothko offer quite a full sound, exploiting the dynamic range of the bass guitar. On Smudges and Smears they achieve a choral effect reminiscent of the Cocteau Twins, while on Moments Cracked Open they evoke the cloying intimacy of My Bloody Valentine. Elsewhere there are echoes of Peter Hook's sepulchral tones for Joy Division. And the sleeve homages to everyone from Duchamp to Devo, William Blake to ZZ Top, suggest Rothko could go anywhere next. (PL) </p> <p><strong> Sandy Dillon</strong><br>East Overshoe (One Little Indian)<br>Rating: ****<br>\u00a313.99 </p> <p>Initially, Sandy Dillon's record company took the classically trained Massachusetts songwriter to be \"a 300lb black woman\". She has a feral rawness that makes the mistake easy to excuse. Despite spending the past 20 years at the hands of managers who modelled her on \"Madonna or whoever was making money at the time\", she has emerged with her unique voice intact, and an appetite for warped country and western. The fictional town of the album title leads you to expect something very different from the frayed, end-of-tether atmosphere that hovers over the songs. Dillon's Hammond organ lurks around corners, the icing on cracked vocals that render the lyrics pretty much indistinguishable. The words \"Jesus Christ, you killed me with a knife\" do leap from Filth and Dust, though - just the sort of blasphemy that would bring a smile to Nick Cave's face. But it's the crazed rural blues of Hot Potato and Girl's Desperate Measures where you really fear for her health. Some album. (CS) </p> <p><strong> Nelly Furtado</strong><br>Whoa, Nelly! (Dreamworks)<br>Rating: ***<br>\u00a314.99 </p> <p>Why Whoa, Nelly!? Is this meant to imply that this Canadian-Portuguese singer is so precocious that she has to be protected from her own talent? You might not believe it if your only experience of her is the twittery top-five single I'm Like a Bird, but there's an irritating kernel of truth to it. She writes, produces and is at home in several genres, including the pastoral pop of the single, the urban R&amp;B of Shit on the Radio, and Latin sounds. Her thinnish voice could get up a few noses, but that's the price she pays for otherwise being pretty damned good. (CS) </p> <p><strong> Rod Stewart</strong><br>Human (Atlantic)<br>Rating: ***<br>\u00a315.99 </p> <p>While not at the stage where only a Tom Jones-style duets album can haul him into the charts, Rod Stewart was none the less smart to get on the phone to Macy Gray, All Saints producer K-Gee and ex-New Radical Gregg Alexander before recording Human. Although old granite-lungs hasn't changed much over the centuries, the beloved R&amp;B and soul of his youth have, and his new collaborators bring him up to speed, near enough. The red-wine-and-candlelight sheen K-Gee brings to the title track is attractive, and Stewart preserves the mood by not rasping like a wildebeest. Subtlety, in fact, is the watchword most of the way through: on the Macy Gray-penned Smitten, and on Don't Come Around Here, a duet with Mercury prize-nominated Helicopter Girl that coaxes out a hitherto hidden vulnerability. Which perhaps accounts for the cover of Prince's Peach that closes the album on a more characteristic bawdy note. Old dog plus new tricks equals funny old album. (CS) </p> <p><strong> Gorillaz</strong><br>Gorillaz (Parlophone)<br>Rating: ****<br>\u00a314.99 </p> <p>Although his collaborators comprise various hip-hop/graphics types, much of Gorillaz sounds like the solo album Damon Albarn probably never thought he would make. After the emotionally traumatic last two Blur albums, it's almost a relief to find Albarn in sunny, wryly observant mood. Gorillaz is no Parklife, but it radiates a similarly innocent joie de vivre that suggests that, for the first time in ages, Albarn is enjoying making music. Gorillaz is steeped in old US electro, UK punk, world music and Sly &amp; Robbie. Some tracks mimic Blur at their most lightweight, but with credit to Albarn's bandmates, things rarely stay too predictable for very long. Indeed, his \"animated\" pals seem to have inspired Albarn to really push his vocals. When not doing a perfectly laconic impersonation of New Order's Bernard Sumner, he's soaring into the upper reaches once occupied by Labi Siffre and Jimmy Cliff. Like any good cartoon, Gorillaz are difficult to love deeply, but impossible not to like. (DS) </p> <p><strong> South</strong><br>From Here On In (Mo'Wax)<br>Rating: ***<br>\u00a311.99 </p> <p>Historically, indie/guitar labels haven't done too well launching dance acts, so it will be interesting to see if hip beats luminaries Mo'Wax can reverse the process. The label proclaims that the debut from guitar prot\u00e9g\u00e9s South \"will undoubtedly become one of the albums of the year\". Which year might that be? Several of South's songs are inescapably reminiscent of the Stone Roses in their pre-dance, goth period. Producer James Lavelle has done little to rein in his signing's irritating tendency towards stoned meanderings, often ending up with a dreary Beta Band. However, within the sludge, there are sparks of magic. Here On In boasts a fabulous hook, guitarist Jamie McDonald's playing is exemplary and evocative throughout, and at their best the trio radiate the intuitive chemistry that comes with playing together from the age of 14 (South are now all 22). With correct guidance, South could yet mature into something special. After bearing with them during the two years it took to make this album, it's hoped Mo'Wax will allow them time to go that extra mile. (DS) </p> <p><strong> Alfie</strong><br>If You Happy With You Need Do Nothing (Twisted Nerve)<br>Rating: ***<br>\u00a311.99 </p> <p>The title to Alfie's debut album almost amounts to a manifesto. Like their label-owner/mate Badly Drawn Boy, they radiate bumbling, lackadaisical charm; but whereas Damon Gough is secretly hiding a driving ambition, this young Manchester quintet seem really content to go with the flow. So this album is actually a collection of gleaming, remastered songs from their Bookends, Montevideo and Alfie EPs; Bookends aches, Manor House Farm sighs and You Make No Bones bounds delightfully, but it's still a disappointment not to find more new tracks. The two that are here are superb: Umlaut opens with quiet, skittering riffs, suddenly skates into huge metallic chords, and thrillingly maintains the dynamic interplay throughout, while Lee Gorton battles with a synth to create the squealiest sound. 2 Up 2 Down, meanwhile, is the only track where vocal duties pass over to cellist Matt McGeever; his voice is all ingenuous sweetness, and can actually hold a tune, which is more than can be said for Gorton. Elsewhere, though, it's the contrast between Gorton's cats-on-the-rooftops miaow and McGeever's lovingly drawn-out cello lines that makes Alfie such an enticing prospect. On this strength, the debut album proper promises to be extraordinary. (MC) </p> <p><strong> I Am Kloot</strong><br>Natural History (We Love You)<br>Rating: ****<br>\u00a312.99 </p> <p>After a couple of fantastic singles, I Am Kloot's album doesn't entirely live up to expectations. What made those early songs so exceptional was the way the Manchester trio created a dark, velvety update of cabaret torch songs that reeled with passion and drama. Twist (the one with the line \"there's blood on your legs, I love you\") is easily the highlight here, closely followed by opening track To You. On both, Pete Jobson's strolling basslines and Andy Hargreaves's casual, airy percussion are a blissful match for John Bramwell's heartfelt but ghostly voice and warm guitar. But if the new songs are more straightforwardly acoustic pop, they are still powerful and involving, largely because Bramwell writes a mean, slanted, invigorating lyric. Just don't leave the album playing: the final hidden track is a right old mess. (MC) </p> <p>\u0095 To listen to the Gorillaz CD, call 09068 626828 and use code 1242*.

      "bodyText": "Talvin Singh Ha (Universal/Island) Rating: ** \u00a315.99 Leytonstone-born Talvin Singh calls himself The Cultural Nomad; Ha, the follow-up to 1998's Mercury music prize-winning OK, was recorded in studios across the globe, from Madras and Bombay to London. Even so, Ha is no stylistically varied tour de force. Instead of a violent collision of opposites to make sparks fly you get a collage effect, all pretty patterns and curlicues. Or, to put it another way, Ha offers less friction than fusion, a puree so smooth you can barely taste it. Both extremes of Singh's musical spectrum are compromised here. Depending on your vantage point, either the drum'n'bass and electro-funk rhythms are smothered by traditional instruments such as sarengi, tablas and Indian harp, or one's enjoyment of the latter is ruined by the intrusion of the former. Ha might well prove educational, and certainly it is Singh's prerogative to provide a showcase for his heritage, but that doesn't mean it's any good. (PL) Rothko In the Pulse of an Artery (Bella Union) Rating: *** \u00a38.99 London band Rothko are the first rock outfit to be comprised of three bassists - Jon Meade, Crawford Blair and Mark Beazley. They are aided and abetted on their third album by Simon Raymonde (ex-Cocteau Twins), who produced and engineered, sings (in a low murmur) and plays sitar on Imprint of Leaves. Considering the limited number of instruments, Rothko offer quite a full sound, exploiting the dynamic range of the bass guitar. On Smudges and Smears they achieve a choral effect reminiscent of the Cocteau Twins, while on Moments Cracked Open they evoke the cloying intimacy of My Bloody Valentine. Elsewhere there are echoes of Peter Hook's sepulchral tones for Joy Division. And the sleeve homages to everyone from Duchamp to Devo, William Blake to ZZ Top, suggest Rothko could go anywhere next. (PL) Sandy Dillon East Overshoe (One Little Indian) Rating: **** \u00a313.99 Initially, Sandy Dillon's record company took the classically trained Massachusetts songwriter to be \"a 300lb black woman\". She has a feral rawness that makes the mistake easy to excuse. Despite spending the past 20 years at the hands of managers who modelled her on \"Madonna or whoever was making money at the time\", she has emerged with her unique voice intact, and an appetite for warped country and western. The fictional town of the album title leads you to expect something very different from the frayed, end-of-tether atmosphere that hovers over the songs. Dillon's Hammond organ lurks around corners, the icing on cracked vocals that render the lyrics pretty much indistinguishable. The words \"Jesus Christ, you killed me with a knife\" do leap from Filth and Dust, though - just the sort of blasphemy that would bring a smile to Nick Cave's face. But it's the crazed rural blues of Hot Potato and Girl's Desperate Measures where you really fear for her health. Some album. (CS) Nelly Furtado Whoa, Nelly! (Dreamworks) Rating: *** \u00a314.99 Why Whoa, Nelly!? Is this meant to imply that this Canadian-Portuguese singer is so precocious that she has to be protected from her own talent? You might not believe it if your only experience of her is the twittery top-five single I'm Like a Bird, but there's an irritating kernel of truth to it. She writes, produces and is at home in several genres, including the pastoral pop of the single, the urban R&amp;B of Shit on the Radio, and Latin sounds. Her thinnish voice could get up a few noses, but that's the price she pays for otherwise being pretty damned good. (CS) Rod Stewart Human (Atlantic) Rating: *** \u00a315.99 While not at the stage where only a Tom Jones-style duets album can haul him into the charts, Rod Stewart was none the less smart to get on the phone to Macy Gray, All Saints producer K-Gee and ex-New Radical Gregg Alexander before recording Human. Although old granite-lungs hasn't changed much over the centuries, the beloved R&amp;B and soul of his youth have, and his new collaborators bring him up to speed, near enough. The red-wine-and-candlelight sheen K-Gee brings to the title track is attractive, and Stewart preserves the mood by not rasping like a wildebeest. Subtlety, in fact, is the watchword most of the way through: on the Macy Gray-penned Smitten, and on Don't Come Around Here, a duet with Mercury prize-nominated Helicopter Girl that coaxes out a hitherto hidden vulnerability. Which perhaps accounts for the cover of Prince's Peach that closes the album on a more characteristic bawdy note. Old dog plus new tricks equals funny old album. (CS) Gorillaz Gorillaz (Parlophone) Rating: **** \u00a314.99 Although his collaborators comprise various hip-hop/graphics types, much of Gorillaz sounds like the solo album Damon Albarn probably never thought he would make. After the emotionally traumatic last two Blur albums, it's almost a relief to find Albarn in sunny, wryly observant mood. Gorillaz is no Parklife, but it radiates a similarly innocent joie de vivre that suggests that, for the first time in ages, Albarn is enjoying making music. Gorillaz is steeped in old US electro, UK punk, world music and Sly &amp; Robbie. Some tracks mimic Blur at their most lightweight, but with credit to Albarn's bandmates, things rarely stay too predictable for very long. Indeed, his \"animated\" pals seem to have inspired Albarn to really push his vocals. When not doing a perfectly laconic impersonation of New Order's Bernard Sumner, he's soaring into the upper reaches once occupied by Labi Siffre and Jimmy Cliff. Like any good cartoon, Gorillaz are difficult to love deeply, but impossible not to like.

      "body": "<p><strong> Joshua Redman</strong><br>Passage of Time (Warner)<br>Rating: ***<br>\u00a313.99 </p> <p> American saxophonist Joshua Redman has enjoyed a meteoric rise since his emergence in the early 1990s. He has been very adept at meeting a non-specialist audience half-way, without compromising a serious and highly skilful commitment to improvising. Redman's influences cover a great deal of jazz sax playing, beginning in the pre-war swing era and moving up to Coltrane and beyond, though Sonny Rollins is always an insistent voice in his head. With last year's Beyond, Redman purred through a selection of postbop originals with a sharp quartet, and this disc features the same band (with Aaron Goldberg on piano, Reuben Rogers on bass and Gregory Hutchinson on drums) on eight more self-penned pieces. A typical piece of Redman quirky urbanity opens the session: an unaccompanied tenor soliloquy full of unexpectedly pastoral melody lines mixed with guttural multiphonics. Most of the subsequent music is coolly delivered, rhythmically fluid postbop. The leader's presence is at times strongly reminiscent of Wayne Shorter's in the mid-1960s Miles Davis quintet. Redman's tonal range is confirmed in the silky, diaphanous Minuet and the exquisite whisper of Time, and his relish for spontaneous conversation is irrepressible on the opening tenor/bass exchange on Enemies Within. But the tunes aren't really strong enough to suggest that Redman the composer is going to upstage Redman the sax virtuoso. </p> <p><strong> Tubby Hayes</strong><br>The Eighth Wonder (Jasmine)<br>Rating: ***<br>\u00a310.99 </p> <p> In the notes to this 1958/59 assortment, the late Tubby Hayes, the most technically accomplished British jazz multi-instrumentalist of the 1960s, rather undiplomatically starts off by rubbishing the UK jazz scene he was working in. Protesting that he couldn't find local musicians who could start and stop in the same places, Hayes elected to play most of the parts himself on the 1958 recordings here - three of the tracks are overdubbed takes in which he plays all the sax parts, plus piano and vibes. But if Hayes managed to tidy things up by this method, the resulting music suffers from the opposite problem to the one he was complaining about - over-orderliness and an absence of earthiness. Unfortunately, too, the selection of material reflects 1950s British jazzers' economic dependence on Mecca ballrooms. The real group takes are by far the most engaging - like the two versions of Tin Tin Deo, in which Hayes's muscular sound, inventiveness in double-time bop phrasing, and shrewd control of contrast confirm why his international reputation was so big at the time. The most dazzling episode is the Unidentified 12 Bar Theme, a lo-fi recording on a Charlie Parker-like fast blues that seems to defy the limits of dexterity, physical or mental. An uneven but fitfully fascinating collector's item. </p> <p><strong> Booker Ervin</strong><br>Structurally Sound (Blue Note Connoisseur Series)<br>Rating: ***<br>\u00a38.99 </p> <p> Booker Ervin, an American saxophonist of the same period as Tubby Hayes, who lent a characteristically rough gravitas to some Charles Mingus bands, was working within the same bop-based framework as Hayes. But Ervin's intonation is more wilful and raw, his texture more bluesy and impassioned. An entangling of graceful and unlovely sounds is a natural balance for him. This 1966 quintet set finds Ervin joined by Charles Tolliver on trumpet and John Hicks on piano, on a mixture of standards, originals, and soon-to-be-standards such as Oliver Nelson's Stolen Moments. It's a classic Blue Note set of the era in its directness and robustness, and hard bop is its dominant mode, despite strong infusions of Coltrane-quartet McCoy Tyner into Hicks's playing. Ervin is strongly reminiscent of later Sonny Rollins (both saxophonists owed some of their inspiration to Dexter Gordon) in the pugnacious shaking of long notes by the throat, and a bleary, shrugging, phlegmatic way of resolving phrases. Oliver Nelson's Stolen Moments gets a familiar delivery of the theme (Ervin catches the right hot, shimmery tenor sound for it) with a powerful series of variations with emphatic funk overtones. John Hicks plays with thumping chordal momentum on Tolliver's uptempo Franess, and Ervin crashes into his break on Shiny Stockings as if battering his way into a locked room. Even White Christmas has a laconic quality. Vintage hard bop on the cusp of things to come. </p> <p>\u0095 To order any CD call Guardian CultureShop on 0800 3166 102.</p>",

At times it's like listening to a Keith Jarrett or Bill Evans trio, but with those pianists' vocabularies eerily rewritten. </p> <p>For two decades, Marilyn Crispell has been one of the most highly regarded pianists at the sharp end of contemporary jazz. This Baltimore-raised musician went to the New England Conservatory to study classical music, and then became diverted by the work of Cecil Taylor and John Coltrane. She eventually became keyboard partner for the fearsome multi-instrumentalist and composer Anthony Braxton, with whom she could share enthusiasms from Coltrane to Hildegard of Bingen. Crispell's subsequent recordings for the Leo label in the 1980s and 1990s revealed that a new improvising piano giant had arrived, with such exquisite explorations of new landscapes as For Coltrane and Gaia (both 1987). </p> <p>This set has Crispell investigating a more lyrical and less awesomely pianistic music. Four of the pieces were improvised from the off, but sound like compositions, such is their conviction and clarity of phrasing. The ruminative opening passages, initially draped around Gary Peacock's plummy, luxurious bass sound, reflect the atmosphere of the whole set. Paul Motian, one of the closest things to a sound-painter in jazz drumming, rustles around Crispell, scattering offbeat snare sounds and brief shimmers of cymbals, occasionally hinting at distantly martial tattoos that cajole and fade. </p> <p>Marilyn Crispell has grown more intrigued by the late Bill Evans in recent years, and the connection is clear in the voicings of some chords, even if there is little of Evans's urgent orthodox swing. Requiem, a piece that echoes Crispell's baroque-music origins, also recalls the dolorous harmonies of Annette Peacock - a composer to whom Crispell devoted an earlier trio disc. </p> <p>Not all the music is reflective - December Greenwings has a folksy, countryfied line and a playfully skippy feel in Crispell's improvising, and on the fast, liquid Rounds Crispell plays a devastating solo of tidal energies and hurtling precision. Maybe it is too close to contemporary classical music (in texture and pacing) for some jazz listeners, but this represents the continuing evolution of a remarkable force, in an ideal context. </p> <p>\u0095 To listen to this CD call 09068 626 828 and use code 2088*.

Four of the pieces were improvised from the off, but sound like compositions, such is their conviction and clarity of phrasing. The ruminative opening passages, initially draped around Gary Peacock's plummy, luxurious bass sound, reflect the atmosphere of the whole set. Paul Motian, one of the closest things to a sound-painter in jazz drumming, rustles around Crispell, scattering offbeat snare sounds and brief shimmers of cymbals, occasionally hinting at distantly martial tattoos that cajole and fade. Marilyn Crispell has grown more intrigued by the late Bill Evans in recent years, and the connection is clear in the voicings of some chords, even if there is little of Evans's urgent orthodox swing. Requiem, a piece that echoes Crispell's baroque-music origins, also recalls the dolorous harmonies of Annette Peacock - a composer to whom Crispell devoted an earlier trio disc. Not all the music is reflective - December Greenwings has a folksy, countryfied line and a playfully skippy feel in Crispell's improvising, and on the fast, liquid Rounds Crispell plays a devastating solo of tidal energies and hurtling precision. Maybe it is too close to contemporary classical music (in texture and pacing) for some jazz listeners, but this represents the continuing evolution of a remarkable force, in an ideal context. \u0095 To listen to this CD call 09068 626 828 and use code 2088*.

The compromise has the backing of senior Labour ministers on both sides of the \"fair votes\" argument, as well as Kennedy loyalists. Some opponents of reform claimed that further delay will help them. A despondent Charter 88 called it a setback. After weeks of speculation that Labour would ditch its half-hearted commitment to a referendum on proportional representation (PR) it emerged last night that Mr Blair and the Liberal Democrat leader met on Tuesday and found a face-saving formula that will encourage tactical anti-Tory voting on polling day. As a result, Labour's manifesto will be far less hostile than many MPs expected to the \"AV-Plus\" version of PR suggested by Lord Jenkins in his 1998 royal commission report - shelved in the face of active pressure on Mr Blair by the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, the chancellor, Gordon Brown, and a majority of Labour MPs and activists. Noting that the government has \"introduced major innovations in electoral systems used in the UK, for the Scottish and European parliaments and Welsh and London assemblies\", the draft formula for Labour's manifesto commitment goes on to promise to \"review the experience of the new systems and the Jenkins report to assess whether changes may be made to the electoral system for the House of Commons\". Though it will also confirm that the referendum which Mr Blair promised Paddy Ashdown in 1997 \"remains the right way to agree any change at Westminster\" the imposition of a review is a vehicle for further delay in exactly the same way that Mr Brown's \"five economic tests\" have delayed the referendum on whether to join the euro. In reality it means that Mr Blair wants to wait until after the PR systems introduced since 1997 - a \"top-up\" system for Scotland and Wales, regional lists for Europe and a second vote in the election for London mayor - bed down over a full cycle.

The commentator invoked the warnings not to fulminate against the Brits but to explain an apparent fall in education standards closer to home. </p> <p>His column was published in the wake of the Ontario government's recently released test scores showing that almost one of every three grade ten students in the nation's most populous province is unable to pass a basic literacy test.</p> <p>In Australia, where falling educational standards are an editorial potboiler, a leader article published in the <strong>Sydney Morning Herald</strong> bemoaned a national survey showing that over half of the country's academics believe their growing dependence on private sector money prevents them criticising organisations on which their university depends. </p> <p>\"The sorts of financial squeeze now being applied to universities will inevitably put pressure on an intellectual culture,\" said the Herald. \"In an environment where the attraction and retention of fee-paying students becomes the measure of success, adequate safeguards are needed more than ever to ensure that slippage of standards does not occur.\"</p> <p>Another commentary on educational standards appeared in South Africa's <strong>Sunday Times</strong>.

      "bodyText": "\"It has become the fashion in Britain to affect to distrust or disdain the arts of speaking and writing so far as they are concerned with ordinary everyday life,\" John Ibbitson, an educator and sometime commentator, observed in a tart opinion piece published last weekend in Canada's Globe and Mail. The nation's classrooms, he added, \"have made themselves a ready agent of this crippling process\". Mr Ibbitson's words ought to have had a familiar ring for British readers: Winston Churchill first spoke them in 1924. The commentator invoked the warnings not to fulminate against the Brits but to explain an apparent fall in education standards closer to home. His column was published in the wake of the Ontario government's recently released test scores showing that almost one of every three grade ten students in the nation's most populous province is unable to pass a basic literacy test. In Australia, where falling educational standards are an editorial potboiler, a leader article published in the Sydney Morning Herald bemoaned a national survey showing that over half of the country's academics believe their growing dependence on private sector money prevents them criticising organisations on which their university depends. \"The sorts of financial squeeze now being applied to universities will inevitably put pressure on an intellectual culture,\" said the Herald. \"In an environment where the attraction and retention of fee-paying students becomes the measure of success, adequate safeguards are needed more than ever to ensure that slippage of standards does not occur.\" Another commentary on educational standards appeared in South Africa's Sunday Times. Op-ed columnist Cornia Pretorius examined the issue of the status of Afrikaans as a teaching language, even while insisting that it was time for the national debate to be brought to an end. The subject had surfaced again last week when verbal blows were exchanged between the country's education minister, Kader Asmal, and Andreas van Wyk, the vice chancellor of the University of Stellenbosch, who said that English appeared to be \"more equal\" than other languages, despite the constitutional equality of all official languages in South Africa. The commentator said, \"The government and historical Afrikaans universities cannot allow the debate about language to drag on. The time and energy they have wasted on the topic over the past few years should rather have been spent on producing a maximum number of graduates.\" The Russia Journal, a weekly business newspaper, said this week that any opposition to standardised university entrance examinations on the part of local educators was entirely understandable. \"After all,\" it noted, with a cough, \"if there are no entrance exams to hold and no grades to assign, who will be willing to bribe the universities' admissions boards?\" On a less ironic note, the article said that what perhaps needed to be first attended to in the Russian education system \"are the infrastructure and ethics of test-taking\".

Two universities - the University of Lagos and the Enugu State University of Technology - have recently been shut down for an indefinite period following clashes involving the two sides, and the Guardian had no hesitation in taking the side of the overdogs.

      "body": "<p>I first met the critic and writer Elizabeth Young, who has died aged 50, at a reading by the novelist Iain Sinclair in the old operating theatre of St Thomas's hospital, London, a sinister relic of the Victorian fascination with surgery as a spectator sport. It was the perfect environment for Liz - seriously literary and distinctly Gothic.</p> <p>It is often said that people have a love affair with books; with Young, it seemed literally true. After a difficult period in the early 1980s, she emerged as one of the most brilliant literary critics of her generation.</p> <p>She combined an extraordinary breadth of reading with the kind of dedication to her craft that if, by any chance, she was asked to review a novel by someone she had not read before, she would make sure to read everything they had previously published first. Above all, she knew what she liked. Her reviewing showed a fierce commitment to truthfulness as the key to literary value.</p> <p>She was an extraordinarily un-snobbish reader, as happy to rave about the talent of a little-feted horror writer like Graham Masterton as to discuss her (slightly) more predictable and critically respectable favourites, such as Hubert Selby or Djuna Barnes, the Greenwich Vill- age avant-gardist whose eccentricities were a particular inspiration. It was scarcely surprising that she was the first critic to notice Irvine Welsh's Trainspotting.</p> <p>Young looked for truth in strange places, both in reading and in life. Her vast book collection contained mini- libraries on the literature of drugs and of true crime - the more sensationalist the better. The issue of drugs, in particular, was always close to her heart. She wrote several powerful features for the Guardian on the mess of hypocrisy and sadism of British drugs policy.</p> <p>Elizabeth Young was born in Lagos, Nigeria, the daughter of Scottish missionaries. She grew up largely in British boarding schools, then studied in London, Paris and York, where she eventually gained a B Phil. Mostly though, she educated herself through reading.</p> <p>In the 1970s, she worked in London's finest alternative bookstore, the late-lamented Compendium Books, in Camden Town. More than simply a bookshop, Compendium was also a cultural centre for the punk-rock scene. And punk rock, with its dark humour, utopian nihilism and fondness for black clothing suited Young better than the hippie ethos ever had. The Clash, in particular, were regular visitors, writing The Prisoner about the shop's patriarch Nick Rochford. Young later made her only acting appearance in their feature film, Rude Boy.</p> <p>The 80s were a hard decade for her, as dabblings with drugs became more serious. Late in the decade, however, with the support of her husband Pete Mannheim, she cleaned up her act and began reviewing for the left-wing London listings magazine, City Limits, encouraged by another Compendium alumnus, Nick Kimberley. She soon moved on to the New Statesman and then, in 1992, published her first book, Shopping In Space (co-written with Graham Caveney).</p> <p>This was ostensibly a study of the new wave of American writers spearheaded by the likes of Bret Easton Ellis, Jay McInerney and Tama Janowitz. However, Young's essays, which made up more than half the book, roamed over the literary dark stuff, spiralling off from meditations on contemporary trans gressives like Dennis Cooper or Ellis's much-maligned masterpiece American Psycho. They also garnered her immediate attention on both sides of the Atlantic, and she was soon reviewing for the nationals here, especially for the Guardian when James Wood was chief literary critic, and for magazines like Spin in the United States.</p> <p>She also found time for her own writing. It was a pain- stakingly slow and self-critical process - and it is a great loss that she never completed the novel she was working on for some years - but she did finish a number of very fine short stories scattered among various anthologies, often commissioned by Nicholas Royle.</p> <p>As her health began to fail in the late 90s, Young refused to simply succumb. Instead, she wrote long articles for Guardian Weekend on the under-researched curse of the hepatitis C from which she suffered. She once wrote a memoir of her great friend Peter Lawson (Loz), a bibliophile and jailbird, for a collection of short stories on the theme of death. It was a tribute to the exoticism of her social circle and the imaginative strength of her work - fiction and criticism alike - that several editors compli- mented her on such a marvellous short story.</p> <p>Young, too, was like that. It is hard to write about her without feeling as if you are describing a character from fiction. Her life was like a work of fiction; in her descriptions of it on the phone - she loved the phone - her stories often seemed fevered, exaggerated, almost unreal, and yet would always turn out to be true. It was the same with her appearance; on anyone else, the look would have been over the top - Miss Havisham goes goth - but on Young it just seemed right.</p> <p>Perhaps she would have been happier if only life had been more like literature. Certainly, it was a great relief to her to have finally submitted the expanded collection of literary essays she had been working on for five years, Pandora's Handbag, to her publishers just months before she died. It was also a great comfort to her when, two years ago, she bought a flat in the remote Scottish village her family came from. This return seemed to provide a certain completion to an often troubled life, and it is there she will be buried.</p> <p><b> John Williams </b></p> <p><b> Deborah Orr writes:</b> Liz's arrival at City Limits, where I first met her in the late 1980s, was preceded by her glamorously countercultural reputation. She was rightly feted by the magazine's literary editor, Jenny Turner, who was uncharacteristically awed by her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, but initially, I found her to be the weirdest, most outlandish, scariest creature I had ever clapped eyes on.</p> <p>She had been the gorgeous girl giving a blow job in the public lavatory in the movie Rude Boy. She was a friend of Kathy Acker, and - astoundingly - entirely understood Ms Acker's challenging literary agenda. She was a disinherited daughter of the Rown- tree confectionery dynasty. She had a vast knowledge of voodoo. Most perverse of all, she didn't drink or smoke dope.</p> <p>She also looked unbelievable; her beautiful face was white and matte, her dark purple hair was streaked with vivid colour. Her clothes, all black, trailed and wisped around her, and her hands were weighed down with gothic jewellery. Most bizarrely, she wore huge platform trainers, then by no means a fashion item.</p> <p>She even smelt uniquely weird. Later, these scents would become familiar to advocates of aromatherapy. On her, in the 1980s, they recalled the whiff of an old-fashioned sweet shop. Some people smell of their family's money; Liz had contrived to cut out the middle-man.</p> <p>The other great shock about Liz was her terrible shyness and lack of self-confidence. She stammered when talking to people she didn't feel at ease with - a situation she would go to great lengths to avoid. She was a gentle and unassuming soul, entirely unaware of the intimidating figure she cut, and shocked and frightened - like a maiden aunt - by the world at large.</p> <p>She lived her life in the retreat of an oddly fictional existence, fuelled by novels and literary theory, sustained by her own writing, and supported by her husband and soulmate, Pete. The thing that gave her character, and her work, its strange, unearthly force was the distance she had built, while remaining largely in denial of it, between herself and life.</p> <p>In this sense, while Liz was indisputably a sort of apotheosis of the counter-culture, she also lived a little beyond even that common society. The singularity shone in her work for Guardian Weekend, to which she was a regular contributor throughout the mid- to late-1990s. As editor, I always wanted to publish whatever she was prepared to write. Mainly, she confined herself to literary profiles, the breadth of her subjects standing testament to her roving intelligence as a reader, writer and critic.</p> <p>One of her first pieces was a profile of Terry Pratchett, a writer whose growing mainstream popularity did nothing to blunt her heightened appreciation. She considered him a genius, and stands as one of his most passionate and shrewd early critics.</p> <p>Other writers she championed were less surprising. She spotted immediately the importance of Dennis Cooper, the American writer whose exposure of the cruel, dark underbelly of gay life, made him persona non grata for most critics. Cooper makes sense of the world in ways we would rather not know about, but Liz believed - correctly - that this wilful blindness was an awful dereliction.</p> <p>On a couple of occasions, she wrote on other subjects - articles, for those who knew her at all well, containing the part of her life she kept hidden, and which so cruelly hampered her engagement with the world. She wrote a pair of long pieces about government policy on hard-drug addiction, condemning the narrow and punitive array of help available to addicts.</p> <p>She was particularly ang- ered by the irony that \"the British method\", whereby addicts can be weaned off hard drugs slowly and under medical supervision, was now illegal here. She loathed the alternative treatment, using the more toxic and addictive methodone.</p> <p>These articles, alongside the vast body of her critical writing, contain a rounded truth about Liz's brave, brilliant, touching, and troubled life and death, something she never had the self-pity to reveal straightforwardly.</p> <p><b> Pete Ayrton writes:</b> It was a rare privilege to be given the opportunity to publish Liz Young - she possessed, in large quantities, empathy, intellectual curiosity and a sustained sense of humour.</p> <p>Because the English tend to only value someone when they are dead, I don't doubt that Pandora's Handbag will be received with the attention it deserves. But I would like to think that this intellectual autobiography, which both warns off and seduces the reader into a life devoted to books, would have been noticed had Liz been there to enjoy its publication. And those of us close to her would not be left with the sense of having lost something very rare - an intellectual who was both sharp and compassionate.</p> <p>\u0095 Elizabeth Jesse Young, writer and critic, born June 6 1950; died March 18 2001.</p>",

Her clothes, all black, trailed and wisped around her, and her hands were weighed down with gothic jewellery. Most bizarrely, she wore huge platform trainers, then by no means a fashion item. She even smelt uniquely weird. Later, these scents would become familiar to advocates of aromatherapy. On her, in the 1980s, they recalled the whiff of an old-fashioned sweet shop. Some people smell of their family's money; Liz had contrived to cut out the middle-man. The other great shock about Liz was her terrible shyness and lack of self-confidence. She stammered when talking to people she didn't feel at ease with - a situation she would go to great lengths to avoid. She was a gentle and unassuming soul, entirely unaware of the intimidating figure she cut, and shocked and frightened - like a maiden aunt - by the world at large. She lived her life in the retreat of an oddly fictional existence, fuelled by novels and literary theory, sustained by her own writing, and supported by her husband and soulmate, Pete. The thing that gave her character, and her work, its strange, unearthly force was the distance she had built, while remaining largely in denial of it, between herself and life. In this sense, while Liz was indisputably a sort of apotheosis of the counter-culture, she also lived a little beyond even that common society. The singularity shone in her work for Guardian Weekend, to which she was a regular contributor throughout the mid- to late-1990s. As editor, I always wanted to publish whatever she was prepared to write. Mainly, she confined herself to literary profiles, the breadth of her subjects standing testament to her roving intelligence as a reader, writer and critic. One of her first pieces was a profile of Terry Pratchett, a writer whose growing mainstream popularity did nothing to blunt her heightened appreciation. She considered him a genius, and stands as one of his most passionate and shrewd early critics. Other writers she championed were less surprising. She spotted immediately the importance of Dennis Cooper, the American writer whose exposure of the cruel, dark underbelly of gay life, made him persona non grata for most critics. Cooper makes sense of the world in ways we would rather not know about, but Liz believed - correctly - that this wilful blindness was an awful dereliction. On a couple of occasions, she wrote on other subjects - articles, for those who knew her at all well, containing the part of her life she kept hidden, and which so cruelly hampered her engagement with the world. She wrote a pair of long pieces about government policy on hard-drug addiction, condemning the narrow and punitive array of help available to addicts. She was particularly ang- ered by the irony that \"the British method\", whereby addicts can be weaned off hard drugs slowly and under medical supervision, was now illegal here. She loathed the alternative treatment, using the more toxic and addictive methodone. These articles, alongside the vast body of her critical writing, contain a rounded truth about Liz's brave, brilliant, touching, and troubled life and death, something she never had the self-pity to reveal straightforwardly. Pete Ayrton writes: It was a rare privilege to be given the opportunity to publish Liz Young - she possessed, in large quantities, empathy, intellectual curiosity and a sustained sense of humour. Because the English tend to only value someone when they are dead, I don't doubt that Pandora's Handbag will be received with the attention it deserves. But I would like to think that this intellectual autobiography, which both warns off and seduces the reader into a life devoted to books, would have been noticed had Liz been there to enjoy its publication. And those of us close to her would not be left with the sense of having lost something very rare - an intellectual who was both sharp and compassionate. \u0095 Elizabeth Jesse Young, writer and critic, born June 6 1950; died March 18 2001.",

In a speech to headteachers which may help to lift the gloom caused by industrial action, Mr Blunkett will set out details of how they will be able to use their discretion to reward exceptionally good young teachers, as well as longer serving managers such as heads of department and deputy heads. The government wants heads and governing bodies to have the flexibility to reward staff through the new direct grants, for which \u00a3100m has been set aside for the next financial year (2002-03) and \u00a3150m for the subsequent year. Addressing the annual conference of the Secondary Heads Association in Newport, south Wales, Mr Blunkett will reveal that more than 150,000 teachers are set to pass the \"threshold\" which will give them an automatic pay rise of \u00a32,000 as well as access to a new, higher payscale. Those rises will be funded separately by the government to the tune of \u00a3400m a year, and backdated to last September. But for the first time, heads will be able to reward exceptionally good young teachers not yet eligible for performance-related pay, by giving them double increments. They will also be able to give extra money to so-called advanced skills teachers; teachers with a management role such as deputy heads; and senior teachers. A teacher working outside London with seven years' classroom experience who had successfully crossed the threshold would expect to earn \u00a331,000 with extra money from the direct grant - or \u00a334,000 in London - while those with a management role would get \u00a341,000 outside London and \u00a344,000 in the capital. Of some 200,000 teachers deemed eligible to apply to cross the threshold, about 180,000 applied and more than 150,000 are likely to be successful.

      "bodyText": "A 94-year-old man refused funding for his nursing home care has won the right to take his case to a judicial review, in a case with major implications for thousands of elderly people forced to sell their homes to fund residential care. The court hearing followed Dorset county council's decision to discontinue paying residential care fees for Christopher Beeson, who had \"gifted\" his home to his only son, Michael, just two years before being taken into care. The review will examine whether a council can legitimately host an appeal against its own decision to refuse to pay for nursing home care, or whether a genuinely independent appeals body should be set up. In what is being seen by lawyers as a landmark case, Mr Beeson's legal team argued at the high court in London that he had been denied the right to a fair trial under article 6 of the Human Rights Act. \"The case is not principally about the right to be placed or looked after by a local authority but how the authority makes the decisions about your care; particularly, in this case, about who is to fund that care. At the moment there is no independent right of appeal against a decision by the local authority,\" said Conrad Haley, a solicitor from the Public Law Project, who is acting for Mr Beeson. \"We are arguing that the decision that was made here was in breach of our client's human rights because they don't allow him to take his case and have it reheard by an independent body.\" He added: \"The only tribunal available was the social services complaints panel, which is made up of two local authority councillors, and we are saying that cannot be described as independent.\" The way has now been opened for a full judicial review after the high court ruled there was an \"arguable\" case to answer. Mr Beeson, who is now cared for at a residential home in Bridgwater, gave his home to his son, Michael, in April 1997. The court was told that Mr Beeson senior was concerned that his son would be homeless after the break-up of his marriage.

What a strange, kaleidoscopic world there is down there: multi-coloured coral with waving pink and orange tentacles, huge blue clams that open and close, little purple flower-like things that pop back into the rock if you come near, and bright fish of all shapes, sizes and colours - butterfly, angel, damsel, boxfish, snappies and a huge Napoleon Maori Wrasse, to name but a few identified from the chart I bought...

The was sea calm and there was not a cloud in the sky. I had a go at snorkelling first, and was not too proud to use the buoyancy vest as Katy had suggested in her email. The whole day I was impressed by how attentive the crew were, continuously counting bodies and snorkels to make sure everyone was safe and well. When it was time to do the introductory dive I was so nervous that they gave me an instructor all to myself. He was very patient, going down very slowly and making me give the OK sign every couple of minutes. Poor bloke, his hand must have been sore from my tight grip.

On Saturday evening I had a delicious meal with Peter and Sally, my real Australians, and picked their brains on the subject of where to go next.

It was a lovely drive with sugar cane fields and forested hills on one side and the sea on the other. Port Douglas is a smart holiday town for the rich and beautiful - there wasn't a backpacker in sight. At Daintree a decision had to be made: should I take a trip down the river or continue to Cape Tribulation, where Captain Cook landed? I decided to press on along the winding road, broken in places by flood water. The Cape is beautiful: rainforest and mango swamps come down to meet the sea, and the reef, empty of people (the odd tour bus can be avoided with a car) was still much as it would have been when Cook landed. Here I was again able to capture one of those delicious moments of feeling at one with nature. </p> <p>Thursday I was ready for more sand, sea and reef, so I caught the ferry out to Fitzroy Island for a bit of walking, swimming and a final snorkel. My batteries are definitely feeling recharged. </p> <p>In yet another of life's coincidences, a young couple who had also won a trip around the world with HMV, and were financing it by writing on a website, had moved in next door. They were doing a very similar route and we swapped travel stories. I am green with envy at their lap-top. I have been in the same hostel for nearly a week - a record. Why change, when the pool even has a jacuzzi at one end? The other people in my six-bed dorm have changed though - one lot of young girls for another.

      "body": "<p>One of the more disheartening pieces of recent music news was the announcement that the Beach Boys would be touring the UK this summer, as a support act to Status Quo. The Beach Boys now boast only one original member, singer Mike Love; what was once America's Favourite Band today consists of a bald man in his 60s bellowing sun-and-surfing oldies, surrounded by hired hands. A depressing sight, but after years of lawsuits and bizarre public arguments, it seems Mike Love is no longer on speaking terms either with the other surviving Beach Boys, Al Jardine and Brian Wilson, or with the concept of dignity. </p> <p>As if to highlight the reduced circumstances of the current line-up, EMI has remastered and reissued the Beach Boys' 1960s back catalogue: 16 albums on eight CDs, including the dispensable Beach Boys Concert/Live in London ( ** ) and the contract-filling Beach Boys Party!/Stack O' Tracks ( * ). Unlike the bullish debuts of their British rivals the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, Surfin' Safari/Surfin' USA ( ** ) both sound tentative and awkward, a collection of songs knocked together to cash in on a teenage fad. By the time of Surfer Girl/Shut Down Volume 2 ( *** ) and Little Deuce Coupe/All Summer Long ( *** ), songwriter and producer Brian Wilson - surely the fastest learner in rock history - was already capable of crafting such sublime pop moments as Don't Worry Baby or I Get Around, but the albums still suffer from the indecent haste with which they were created. In the early 1960s, the Beach Boys were averaging an album every four months, and it shows. The CDs are padded out with teeth-gritting comedy skits, while Surfer Girl suffers from a lyrical monomania that tests the patience (Surfer Moon, Rocking Surfer, Surfers Rule, South Bay Surfer). Far better is the coupling of Beach Boys Today!/Summer (Days and Summer Nights!) ( ***** ), the one essential CD here, a startlingly mature collection of exquisitely arranged, beautifully sung tracks, as inspired as any music produced in the mid-1960s. </p> <p>The remainder of the CDs hail from the era following the Beach Boys' artistic high-water mark Pet Sounds, and Wilson's drug-induced breakdown during the making of the doomed psychedelic epic Smile. Smiley Smile/Wild Honey ( *** ) and Friends/20-20 ( *** ) are disjointed and uneven: Wilson's genius only flickered intermittently - on Friends's lovely Time to Get Alone or Smiley Smile's chilling, acid-damaged Wind Chimes - as he struggled with his ruined psyche. </p> <p>Brian Wilson wasn't the only Hollywood resident who spent 1967 going slowly insane while trying to create a psychedelic masterpiece. Up in Laurel Canyon, the already peculiar Arthur Lee was becoming more peculiar by the day, ingesting hopeless quantities of drugs and working on his band Love's third album, the remarkable Forever Changes (Warners/Rhino, ***** ). Now remastered, Forever Changes sounds both more gorgeous and more unsettling than ever. Few records so awash with strings and Mariachi trumpets sound this sinister, but then few records offer such a heady cocktail of impeccable pop songwriting, lavish orchestration and sweetly crooned lyrics about isolation and mental illness. It's a far cry from the buttercup-sandwich whimsy of most psychedelia: Wonder People, one of six outtakes added to the CD, was dropped from Forever Changes for sounding carefree. After the album flopped, it was all downhill for Love: the band broke up, two members were reduced to robbing doughnut stands to finance their addictions, and Arthur Lee - a zealous consumer of LSD - survived an overdose, briefly changed his name to Arthur Ex-Lax and currently resides in prison. </p> <p>Another drawback of becoming a musical acid casualty is that future generations mistake your distress for charmingly dotty creativity and spend their own careers aping you. Take English singer-songwriter Robyn Hitchcock, who has spent the past 25 years as a kind of ersatz Syd Barrett, offering jangly psychedelia, deadpan vocals and look-at-me-I'm-nutty lyrics without the anguish or terror of the Pink Floyd founder's oeuvre. Largely ignored at home, Hitchcock has influential American fans: REM are sometime collaborators, Jonathan Demme made a film about him. Accordingly, the US label Matador has seen fit to add a boggling 26 extra tracks to Underwater Moonlight ( *** ), a 1980 album by Hitchcock's first band, the Soft Boys. Now a double CD, it's maddeningly inconsistent: great when it escapes its influences and delivers songs gleaming with harmonies and a pastoral eccentricity all of their own, irritating when it piles on the Monty Python rhymes and undergrad smuggery. </p> <p>Drug-influenced rock of a less contrived and more disturbing nature is to be found on Royal Trux (Domino, * ), the eponymous 1988 debut of now-split alt-blues couple Jennifer Herrema and Neil Hagerty. During the album sessions, the duo's celebrated Keith Richard obsession stretched to cultivating ruinous - and audible - heroin habits: Royal Trux sounds exactly like two hopeless junkies in a cheap studio making up a horrid squall of off-key guitars, out-of-time drums, and tuneless moaning in lieu of vocals as they go along. More endurance test than album, it captures the desolation of acute smack addiction perfectly and is therefore no fun whatsoever. </p> <p>Royal Trux is one of several albums from the American art-rock underground being reissued by UK label Domino. No less dolorous, but considerably more enjoyable, is Smog's 1992 mini-album Burning Kingdom ( **** ), which pits a gothic, Velvet Underground-derived guitar-and-viola grind against songwriter Bill Callahan's beguilingly mordant sense of humour. \"Mother's smoking pot in bathroom,\" he gloomily observes on My Family, \"I can hear her butt squeaking on the tub.\" A more mischievous wit is evident on Chicago post-rock pioneer Jim O'Rourke's Bad Timing ( *** ). A collection of lengthy acoustic guitar and piano instrumentals, Bad Timing is rescued from ponderous indulgence by self-deprecating musical flourishes, best sampled on the closing track, which meanders quietly for several minutes before its contemplative mood is disturbed by the incongruous arrival of a jaunty jazz combo. </p> <p>With the compilation of early singles that comprises Pavement's Westing by Musket and Sextant ( ** ) proving only that Pavement became a lot more enjoyable when they eased up on the arty posturing and started writing songs instead, the true jewel of Domino's reissue project is There Is No One What Will Take Care of You ( ***** ), the first album by the Palace Brothers. These days, the Palace Brothers' leader Will Oldham goes under the name Bonnie Prince Billy and has his songs covered by Johnny Cash, fitting recognition for his role in rehabilitating country and western as a subversive musical force. Heartbreakingly stark and driven by Oldham's raw, cracked voice, the songs on There Is No One What Will Take Care of You strip away decades of Nashville gloss to reveal an unexpected vulnerability and tenderness. Desperate sadness has rarely sounded so wonderful.</p>",

A short-form version of the agreement, which is expected to see 40 live PPV games per season offered by all four pay-TV operators over three years, has already been put before the Premier League chairmen. The broadcasters and Premier League are now thrashing out the long-form version. The Premier League has been seeking to put together a new PPV deal since its initial agreement with NTL was torn up by the US-owned cable TV operator in October. That deal was worth \u00a3327m for 40 matches a year over three years. BSkyB, which paid \u00a31.1bn to hold onto its Premier League pay-TV contract last year, was barred from the bidding for PPV rights under the rules of the original rights auction.

It accused Nato of failing to quash what it called terrorist activities in Kosovo, southern Serbia and Macedonia. The statement comes as the UN high commissioner for refugees estimated that more than 22,000 Macedonians have left their homes since fighting broke out last week. Today, ethnic Albanian rebels engaged Macedonian government forces in isolated skirmishes, and the US military in Kosovo said that seven explosions were heard near the village of Tanusevci, on the border with Kosovo. There were unconfirmed reports that the Macedonian army was trying to clear border villages because people there were suspected of having sympathised with the rebels. \"These developments are a direct outcome of Nato aggression against Yugoslavia and the subsequent new, misguided steps the Western countries have taken in Kosovo,\" the Russian foreign ministry said. \"The policy of wooing the Albanian separatists and using them in fighting (former Yugoslav president) Slobodan Milosevic has led to an intractable and dangerous situation.\" According to the statement, the problems in Kosovo have persisted after Mr Milosevic's departure from office because of the activities of Albanian rebels in northern Macedonia seeking to form an independent ethnic Albanian state. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, was to meet with the Macedonian president, Boris Trajkovski, at the EU meeting in Stockholm today, the ITAR-Tass news agency said. It was expected that Mr Trajkovski would seek the support of European leaders to help resolve the crisis. Russia has historic and religious ties with the Serbs who dominate Yugoslavia, and strongly opposed Nato's airstrikes on Yugoslavia in 1999.

The clapped-out old sod hardly ever plays these days, and has flown out to Colorado to see if Dr Richard Steadman, a specialist in pensioner ailments, can sort out his rusty old knee. Ee, it's been giving him gyp since, ooh, let me think, December. Yes, December. Anyway, the nice young doctor's taken a look, and told him to put his feet up, get some rest, and take frequent naps for at least the next four weeks. That might sort it without having to go under the knife.</p> <p>However, despite this good news, Ye Alan is looking on the dark side (which, to be fair, is the prerogative of the senior citizen). \"He told me that the surgery I had in December and the rehabilitation programme were both fine and there is a chance that rest will resolve the problem,\" he grumbled, as he shooed away a nurse who was approaching with a flannel and a bucket of soapy water. \"If not, I might need additional minor surgery which would probably keep me out for the rest of the season,\" he harumphed, clearly unimpressed by the chap next to him who was having a little accident.</p> <p>But you can't just put the elderly in a home and leave them to rot. So hooray for young Bobby Robson, who dutifully bounded in for a natter with his old warhorse. \"He's such a valuable player, we need to get him absolutely right and top-deck,\" chirruped Bobby. \"It's a slight worry to us, so we decided to go for a second opinion with full approval from our own surgeon,\" the Toon boss could be heard to explain, before he was totally drowned out by his captain's semi-coherent ramblings regarding varicose veins, recent episodes of Countdown, and the Blitz.</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"Many people in England don't like me.

Brown, whose vice-chairman Paul Grafton has also resigned, claims he has quit because the club's reputation was suffering from charges of financial irregularities made against him. But he insisted: \"This in no way should be seen as me trying to run away from the current situation as nothing would have given me more satisfaction than to prove certain people wrong.\" And as he made his way down the M1, he added: \"This decision is made purely in the best interests of Chesterfield Football Club.\"</p> <p>Not surprisingly, it wasn't long before Chesterfield manager Nicky Law popped up with a string of footballing clich\u00e9s. \"I was shocked,\" he said. \"It's news to us all and it's a shame for the chairman.

The families, collectively known as the Marchioness Action Group, which represents survivors and the families of those who died, welcomed today's report by Lord Justice Clarke and asked for its recommendations to be acted upon immediately. Their determination to see the fight through to the bitter end was plain on the faces of the handful of relatives who spoke after the report's publication. They welcomed the completion of the inquiry, which placed blame for the tragedy in the hands of the managers and owners of the Bowbelle and Marchioness, and vowed to pursue those responsible. Eileen Dallaglio, who lost her 19-year-old daughter Francesca Guila Maria in the tragedy, said: \"We are emotionally crippled and we have been emotionally crippled and emotionally raped over the last 12 years.\" Ms Dallaglio, mother of England rugby union star Lawrence Dallaglio, added: \"It is time now for us to pick up the pieces in our lives and go forward, but first we have to see what can be done to tackle those people responsible.\" Billy Gorman, who lost his sister-in-law, 41-year-old Carmella Ann Marie Lennon-Gorman, in the 1989 tragedy, said the report was the first time in 12 years that anyone had been blamed. Earlier Mr Gorman presented the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, with a picture showing Mr Prescott with members of the Marchioness Action Group outside No 10 Downing Street.

      "bodyText": "The prime minister, Tony Blair, today ordered the precautionary \"firebreak\" cull to be extended to all parts of Britain as a government report warned that more than 4,000 cases of foot and mouth disease could be recorded in the UK by June. Mr Blair's action will see all animals within a one mile radius of an infected farm slaughtered. Today's study predicts that there may soon be 70 outbreaks a day and recommends drastic action to bring the disease under control. In answer, Mr Blair also called for all infected animals to be slaughtered within 24 hours of diagnosis. The government report said the number of cases will rise steeply, with rapid expansion in the infected areas. The speedier slaughter of infected animals will help to reduce the spread of the virus but the cull needs to include the immediate slaughter of all susceptible species around infected farms, it said. The report, compiled for the ministry of agriculture by foot and mouth specialists, warned that, without such drastic action, the disease will become firmly established in Britain. Speaking at the EU summit in Stockholm, Mr Blair said the leaders of other member states had been sympathetic to Britain's plight and had offered help in the form of veterinary expertise. But Mr Blair refused to be drawn on whether he will postpone the May 3 local elections. \"Everyone keeps asking me about elections, but my priority has to be getting this disease under control,\" he said. Experts from the institute of animal health and veterinary laboratories agency, who helped to compile today's report, also said that the UK's last major epidemic, in 1967, was \"quite different\". This time, they warned, more of the country was infected with the spread of the disease by sheep. The total number of outbreaks has risen to 480, including the case in Northern Ireland. The number of animals condemned for slaughter has risen to 435,491, which is already more than the 433,987 killed in the eight-month outbreak in 1967/8, with more to come. What's going on?

Deutsche Telekom will keep the existing consumer brands in each of its markets, such as One2One in the UK and Max.Mobil in Austria. But the T-Mobile brand will begin to appear on the UK high street as the company launches international products under the brand name.

Deutsche Telekom is in the process of formulating a global advertising strategy for T-Mobile. The advertising is scheduled to begin in the summer but an advertising agency has yet to be appointed. The brand will be \"distinct but complementary to\" the existing T-Mobile brand, which is used in Germany. The decision to keep separate consumer brands in different markets goes against moves by rival telecoms companies, which are busy establishing global brands.

      "body": "<p>There are 60m cattle, sheep and pigs in the United Kingdom. That is slightly more than one beast for every man, woman and child. But the proportion is set to drop sharply: already, a quarter of a million animals have been slaughtered, and hundreds of thousands more are condemned to premature death.</p> <p>The Ministry of Agriculture and the National Farmers' Union do not always see eye to eye, but on this issue they are as one. The only way to contain and then eradicate foot and mouth is, they insist, the mass slaughter of not only already affected animals, but those vulnerable to the disease.</p> <p>Opponents of the policy, including some farmers, animal \"rights\" activists and those simply sickened by the televised sight of burning or rotting carcasses, have come up with at least three other options: vaccination, preventive medicine, and simply allowing affected animals to recover.</p> <p><b>Vaccination</b></p> <p>Many people simply can't make sense of the authorities' refusal to contemplate vaccination, which was widely and effectively carried out in continental Europe until the early 1990s, when the practice was banned by the EU.</p> <p>Vaccination is expensive and complex. There are seven main varieties of the foot and mouth virus, and dozens of sub-types. The present epidemic in Britain involves the particularly virulent pan-Asiatic O type. Animals can be protected by vaccination, but the treatment does not invariably work, and has to be repeated every six months or so - and in every new generation.</p> <p>Because the vaccine produces antibodies, it would be impossible to distinguish between treated animals and those which have contracted foot and mouth disease. In effect, this would result in the loss of disease-free status for British animals, and kill the meat export trade stone dead. The NFU says bleakly: \"With the annual value of UK exports totalling \u00a3576m, the loss of our disease-free status would spell the death of the UK livestock industry.\"</p> <p>The counter-argument, of course, is that the accumulated loss to British farming and to the rural economy in general is set to dwarf that figure.</p> <p>Moreover, if the EU reintroduced vaccination throughout the community, all member states would compete on a level playing field - though exports beyond the EU would certainly be severely curtailed.</p> <p><b>Preventive measures</b></p> <p>There is a rising clamour among farmers and others who remember the borax treatment widely used during the 1967 outbreak. Proponents believe that the preparation, easily administered in the animals' drinking water, provided cheap and effective protection against foot and mouth.</p> <p>Not so, says the Ministry of Agriculture: \"We are aware that some pharmacies have advertised a homeopathic product called Borax 30 as a preventative measure against foot and mouth disease. However this product has not been authorised under these regulations. We have received no scientific evidence to demonstrate its effectiveness against foot and mouth disease and we have not assessed its safety or quality.\"</p> <p><b>Allowing animals to recover</b></p> <p>Foot and mouth is not generally a killer disease. It is distressing for the animals affected, but most recover in two to three weeks. So why, as many people are asking, don't we simply leave the poor beasts alone?</p> <p>The answer may sound ruthless, but it is logical. When animals recover from infection by one foot and mouth virus, they have little or no immunity against attack from any other variety. They are vulnerable to secondary infections, lose weight, and give lower milk yields. In short, they become unproductive. In addition, the virus can survive in the respiratory tract of recovered animals, which could go on to infect other animals.</p> <p><a href=\"MAIL TO:DBROWN445@AOL.COM\">dbrown445@aol.com</a></p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,443686,00.html\">Full list: outbreaks </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,460510,00.html\">Full list: closed &amp; cancelled</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\">Causes and effects</a></p> <p><b>Cartoon</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/countdown/graphic/0,7367,461820,00.html\">Steve Bell on royal involvement in the crisis</a></p> <p><b>The front line</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,461969,00.html\">23.03.2001: Small beer in the tourist trade</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,459872,00.html\">20.03.2001: Looking forward to Easter, nervously</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,457805,00.html\">16.03.2001: Watching, waiting and hoping</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,451194,00.html\">13.03.2001: The town is 'uncannily quiet'</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html\">05.03.2001: Creeping ever closer</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html\">06.03.2001: The front line</a><br>What is the situation on the ground?

      "bodyText": "There are 60m cattle, sheep and pigs in the United Kingdom. That is slightly more than one beast for every man, woman and child. But the proportion is set to drop sharply: already, a quarter of a million animals have been slaughtered, and hundreds of thousands more are condemned to premature death. The Ministry of Agriculture and the National Farmers' Union do not always see eye to eye, but on this issue they are as one. The only way to contain and then eradicate foot and mouth is, they insist, the mass slaughter of not only already affected animals, but those vulnerable to the disease. Opponents of the policy, including some farmers, animal \"rights\" activists and those simply sickened by the televised sight of burning or rotting carcasses, have come up with at least three other options: vaccination, preventive medicine, and simply allowing affected animals to recover. Vaccination Many people simply can't make sense of the authorities' refusal to contemplate vaccination, which was widely and effectively carried out in continental Europe until the early 1990s, when the practice was banned by the EU. Vaccination is expensive and complex. There are seven main varieties of the foot and mouth virus, and dozens of sub-types. The present epidemic in Britain involves the particularly virulent pan-Asiatic O type. Animals can be protected by vaccination, but the treatment does not invariably work, and has to be repeated every six months or so - and in every new generation. Because the vaccine produces antibodies, it would be impossible to distinguish between treated animals and those which have contracted foot and mouth disease. In effect, this would result in the loss of disease-free status for British animals, and kill the meat export trade stone dead. The NFU says bleakly: \"With the annual value of UK exports totalling \u00a3576m, the loss of our disease-free status would spell the death of the UK livestock industry.\" The counter-argument, of course, is that the accumulated loss to British farming and to the rural economy in general is set to dwarf that figure. Moreover, if the EU reintroduced vaccination throughout the community, all member states would compete on a level playing field - though exports beyond the EU would certainly be severely curtailed. Preventive measures There is a rising clamour among farmers and others who remember the borax treatment widely used during the 1967 outbreak. Proponents believe that the preparation, easily administered in the animals' drinking water, provided cheap and effective protection against foot and mouth. Not so, says the Ministry of Agriculture: \"We are aware that some pharmacies have advertised a homeopathic product called Borax 30 as a preventative measure against foot and mouth disease. However this product has not been authorised under these regulations. We have received no scientific evidence to demonstrate its effectiveness against foot and mouth disease and we have not assessed its safety or quality.\" Allowing animals to recover Foot and mouth is not generally a killer disease. It is distressing for the animals affected, but most recover in two to three weeks. So why, as many people are asking, don't we simply leave the poor beasts alone? The answer may sound ruthless, but it is logical. When animals recover from infection by one foot and mouth virus, they have little or no immunity against attack from any other variety. They are vulnerable to secondary infections, lose weight, and give lower milk yields. In short, they become unproductive. In addition, the virus can survive in the respiratory tract of recovered animals, which could go on to infect other animals. dbrown445@aol.com What's going on?

      "body": "<b>First past the post</b> <p>First past the post (FPTP) is the electoral system used in UK general elections. Electors vote for one individual (usually representing a political party) in single-member constituencies. The candidate with the most votes wins a seat in the House of Commons.</p> <p><b>Strengths:</b> <br>\u0095 The only system ever used in British general elections - producing strong, decisive governments with an overall majority in parliament, despite the fact that no post-war British political party has won more than 50% of the popular vote. <br>\u0095 With every voter represented by one MP, it provides a clear democratic link between the people and parliament. <br>\u0095 It is quick and simple for the voters.</p> <p><b>Weaknesses:</b> <br>\u0095 It is unfair and not remotely proportional, distorting election results so one party almost always forms the government: In 1997, Labour won 44.33% of the vote, which FPTP translated into 419 Commons seats - 63.58% of the total. <br>\u0095 It disenfranchises the millions of voters who don't back the winner in their constituency: their votes are, in effect, useless; their democratic voice unheard.</p> <p> <b>Where used:</b> UK, USA, Canada and India.</p> <p><b>The Alternative Vote (AV)</b></p> <p>The same FPTP constituency boundaries are used and voters again return one MP from their constituency to parliament. But instead of voting for one candidate, preferences are recorded on the ballot paper. If no one candidate wins an overall majority, the candidate who received the least first-choice votes is eliminated and the second choices of the voters who backed them are allocated to the other candidates. This process continues until one candidate obtains an overall majority.</p> <p><b>Strengths:</b> <br>\u0095 It retains the single member constituency system and its advantages: it is likely to produce one clearly victorious party which can form government and keeps a clear and simple line of accountability between voters and their MP. <br>\u0095 It ensures all MPs are credible, having been elected by an absolute majority of their constituents. <br>\u0095 It makes individual votes less likely to be wasted: if your first-choice candidate isn't chosen, your second or third choice probably will be.</p> <p><b>Weaknesses:</b> <br>\u0095 It would not necessarily make the party composition of parliament more in proportion with votes cast across the country: research by Democratic Audit in 1997 discovered that results could be more distorting than under FPTP. <br>\u0095 The thousands who don't wish to back the one of the major political parties still remain disenfranchised.</p> <p><b>Where used:</b> The Australian House of Representatives.</p> <p><b>The Alternative Vote Plus (AV+) </b></p> <p>This mixed system, combining constituencies and a top-up vote, was proposed by the highly respected Jenkins Commission on the voting system in 1998. Voters have two votes. With one they elect a constituency MP by AV. These MPs form four-fifths of the House of Commons. With the other they vote for a candidate on a region list produced by the political parties. These \"top-up\" candidates are used to correct imbalances in the AV system, electing candidates from parties whose share of the national vote merits a greater share of seats in parliament than they had won with the first vote.</p> <p><b>Strengths:</b> <br>\u0095 Michael White calls it a \"<a href=\"http://www.newsunlimited.co.uk/pr/article/0,2763,119138,00.html\">clever compromise</a>\". <br>\u0095 It retains the constituency link between people and parliament and yet its top-up formula helps correct imbalances in any FPTP or AV voting system.</p> <p><b>Weaknesses:</b> <br>\u0095 It is a new, untried and untested system: as it hasn't been used in any country in the world, it is hard to assess what teething troubles may emerge. <br>\u0095 Reducing the number of constituency MPs increases constituency size, meaning people may feel less close to their MPs. <br>\u0095 Two categories of MPs are created and, as they are elected in different ways, they may come to have different status. Those picked from a regional list may have less constituency work and be considered slavish party loyalists as they have, in effect, been chosen by parties' central offices.</p> <p><b>The Single Transferable Vote (STV)</b></p> <p>STV is a preferential voting system (as AV) in multi-member constituencies. Voters rank the candidates according to their preference, and each constituency elects between three and five MPs, depending on its size. Those candidates reaching a certain quota of votes are elected. Surplus votes for the elected candidates and the votes for the least supported candidate are redistributed on the basis of voters' second choices. This process continues until the required number of MPs reach the necessary quota and are returned to parliament.</p> <p><b>Strengths:</b> <br>\u0095 STV is one of the most proportional systems, producing a result which closely reflects the distribution of votes. <br>\u0095 In Britain, a government would almost certainly have to be a coalition of parties, which could end destructive adversarialism (opposition for opposition's sake) and produce consensual and moderate government, better reflecting the wishes of the people. <br>\u0095 It retains a constituency link and, compared to other voting systems, ensures that many more voters are likely to have a meaningful vote which helps select an MP from their constituency who represents their views.</p> <p><b>Weaknesses:</b> <br>\u0095 Opponents of STV argue that the coalition governments it is likely to produce in Britain would be weak, divided and indecisive. <br>\u0095 Coalition governments tend to be created by political deals in \"smoke-filled rooms\" which the voters have no control over. <br>\u0095 The government which emerges bears no relation to the individual parties most voters support. <br>\u0095 STV is also a complex system which could confuse voters and take several days to calculate. <br>\u0095 The large, multi-member constituencies erode the clear and direct link between voters and their MP in single-member constituencies.</p> <p><b>Where used:</b> The Australian Senate, the Republic of Ireland, Tasmania, Malta and for elections to the European Parliament.</p> <p><b>Additional Member System (AMS)</b></p> <p>Like AV+, AMS is a mixed system, combining simple constituency elections and a directly elected proportional component. Voters cast two votes - one for a constituency MP and one party vote.</p> <p><b>Strengths:</b> <br>\u0095 It retains the advantages of a simple single-member constituency system and helps balance the disproportionate results this can produce. <br>\u0095 By providing for a party vote it best reflects the reality of modern voting: that electorates back parties rather than individual candidates. <br>\u0095 A \"threshold\" qualification on the party vote ensures that extremists, who win less than 5% of the vote for instance, are still excluded from parliament.</p> <p><b>Weaknesses:</b> <br>\u0095 Half the MPs are, in effect, picked by their party leadership and remain unaccountable to any individual voters. The undemocratic power of party patronage is massively increased and two very different types of MPs are returned to parliament. <br>\u0095 The two votes are separate, so the second, purely proportional vote only mitigates, rather than corrects, the imbalances of the simple constituency election. <br>\u0095 In Germany, it has created strong, stable administrations, but these have never been single party governments. <br>\u0095 As with other coalition-forming PR systems, it tends to give a small, centrist party massive deal-making power, because larger parties need their support to form a majority government.</p> <p><b>Where used:</b> Germany.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://ElectionResources.org/europe.html#UK\">Election resources on the internet</a><br><a href=\"http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/\">Electoral reform society</a><br><a href=\"http://www.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm40/4090/glossary.htm\">Jenkins Commission on the main electoral systems</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "First past the post First past the post (FPTP) is the electoral system used in UK general elections. Electors vote for one individual (usually representing a political party) in single-member constituencies. The candidate with the most votes wins a seat in the House of Commons. Strengths: \u0095 The only system ever used in British general elections - producing strong, decisive governments with an overall majority in parliament, despite the fact that no post-war British political party has won more than 50% of the popular vote. \u0095 With every voter represented by one MP, it provides a clear democratic link between the people and parliament. \u0095 It is quick and simple for the voters. Weaknesses: \u0095 It is unfair and not remotely proportional, distorting election results so one party almost always forms the government: In 1997, Labour won 44.33% of the vote, which FPTP translated into 419 Commons seats - 63.58% of the total. \u0095 It disenfranchises the millions of voters who don't back the winner in their constituency: their votes are, in effect, useless; their democratic voice unheard. Where used: UK, USA, Canada and India. The Alternative Vote (AV) The same FPTP constituency boundaries are used and voters again return one MP from their constituency to parliament. But instead of voting for one candidate, preferences are recorded on the ballot paper. If no one candidate wins an overall majority, the candidate who received the least first-choice votes is eliminated and the second choices of the voters who backed them are allocated to the other candidates. This process continues until one candidate obtains an overall majority. Strengths: \u0095 It retains the single member constituency system and its advantages: it is likely to produce one clearly victorious party which can form government and keeps a clear and simple line of accountability between voters and their MP. \u0095 It ensures all MPs are credible, having been elected by an absolute majority of their constituents. \u0095 It makes individual votes less likely to be wasted: if your first-choice candidate isn't chosen, your second or third choice probably will be. Weaknesses: \u0095 It would not necessarily make the party composition of parliament more in proportion with votes cast across the country: research by Democratic Audit in 1997 discovered that results could be more distorting than under FPTP. \u0095 The thousands who don't wish to back the one of the major political parties still remain disenfranchised. Where used: The Australian House of Representatives. The Alternative Vote Plus (AV+) This mixed system, combining constituencies and a top-up vote, was proposed by the highly respected Jenkins Commission on the voting system in 1998. Voters have two votes. With one they elect a constituency MP by AV. These MPs form four-fifths of the House of Commons. With the other they vote for a candidate on a region list produced by the political parties. These \"top-up\" candidates are used to correct imbalances in the AV system, electing candidates from parties whose share of the national vote merits a greater share of seats in parliament than they had won with the first vote. Strengths: \u0095 Michael White calls it a \"clever compromise\". \u0095 It retains the constituency link between people and parliament and yet its top-up formula helps correct imbalances in any FPTP or AV voting system. Weaknesses: \u0095 It is a new, untried and untested system: as it hasn't been used in any country in the world, it is hard to assess what teething troubles may emerge. \u0095 Reducing the number of constituency MPs increases constituency size, meaning people may feel less close to their MPs. \u0095 Two categories of MPs are created and, as they are elected in different ways, they may come to have different status. Those picked from a regional list may have less constituency work and be considered slavish party loyalists as they have, in effect, been chosen by parties' central offices. The Single Transferable Vote (STV) STV is a preferential voting system (as AV) in multi-member constituencies. Voters rank the candidates according to their preference, and each constituency elects between three and five MPs, depending on its size. Those candidates reaching a certain quota of votes are elected. Surplus votes for the elected candidates and the votes for the least supported candidate are redistributed on the basis of voters' second choices. This process continues until the required number of MPs reach the necessary quota and are returned to parliament. Strengths: \u0095 STV is one of the most proportional systems, producing a result which closely reflects the distribution of votes. \u0095 In Britain, a government would almost certainly have to be a coalition of parties, which could end destructive adversarialism (opposition for opposition's sake) and produce consensual and moderate government, better reflecting the wishes of the people. \u0095 It retains a constituency link and, compared to other voting systems, ensures that many more voters are likely to have a meaningful vote which helps select an MP from their constituency who represents their views. Weaknesses: \u0095 Opponents of STV argue that the coalition governments it is likely to produce in Britain would be weak, divided and indecisive. \u0095 Coalition governments tend to be created by political deals in \"smoke-filled rooms\" which the voters have no control over. \u0095 The government which emerges bears no relation to the individual parties most voters support. \u0095 STV is also a complex system which could confuse voters and take several days to calculate. \u0095 The large, multi-member constituencies erode the clear and direct link between voters and their MP in single-member constituencies. Where used: The Australian Senate, the Republic of Ireland, Tasmania, Malta and for elections to the European Parliament. Additional Member System (AMS) Like AV+, AMS is a mixed system, combining simple constituency elections and a directly elected proportional component. Voters cast two votes - one for a constituency MP and one party vote. Strengths: \u0095 It retains the advantages of a simple single-member constituency system and helps balance the disproportionate results this can produce. \u0095 By providing for a party vote it best reflects the reality of modern voting: that electorates back parties rather than individual candidates. \u0095 A \"threshold\" qualification on the party vote ensures that extremists, who win less than 5% of the vote for instance, are still excluded from parliament. Weaknesses: \u0095 Half the MPs are, in effect, picked by their party leadership and remain unaccountable to any individual voters. The undemocratic power of party patronage is massively increased and two very different types of MPs are returned to parliament. \u0095 The two votes are separate, so the second, purely proportional vote only mitigates, rather than corrects, the imbalances of the simple constituency election. \u0095 In Germany, it has created strong, stable administrations, but these have never been single party governments. \u0095 As with other coalition-forming PR systems, it tends to give a small, centrist party massive deal-making power, because larger parties need their support to form a majority government.

      "body": "<p>A day after Israeli women's activists celebrated the landmark legal verdict that convicted a former general and cabinet minister of sexual harrassment, there came a sobering reminder of what life can be like for the female population.</p> <p>Today's front page story is about two women killed by their partners. Brascova Kaiserman, aged 82, was bludgeoned to death with a hammer by her 90-year-old husband because he was upset with the lunch she had cooked for him in their flat in an old-peoples' home in the central town of Gedera.</p> <p>A few hours earlier, and a short drive away to the south, Olga Karrol, aged 30, was stabbed to death by her former partner in full view of the neighbours outside her home in Ashdod.</p> <p>On March 8 - International Women's Day - she had filed her second police complaint against Shliko Hundashvili in a month, accusing him of battery. Police said yesterday they had been hunting Hundashvili before the murder, but had failed to locate him.</p> <p>The juxtaposition of events has punctured the mood of euphoria that had greeted the conviction of a man once seen as a potential prime minister - Yitzhak Mordechai - for indecently assaulting a woman soldier under his command when he was a leading general in 1992, and for sexually harassing a party activist when he was the country's defence minister in 1996.</p> <p>Under Israeli law, Mordechai faces a maximum sentence of 10 years although, in practise, prison terms are far lower. Women's activists said the verdict was an important step in placing the issue of sexual harassment onto the public agenda.</p> <p>\"The verdict in the Mordechai case has finally buried an old and loathsome world in which sexual harassment was called legitimate courting, and sexual assault was accepted with understanding,\" said a front-page comment in the Ma'ariv newspaper.</p> <p>The fall from grace of so prominent a figure as Mordechai began making an impact well before his verdict was announced. Israel's network of sexual assault crisis centres received 15,000 complaints last year - nearly double the 8,000 cases reported in 1999 - as women drew courage about challenging what had once been accepted practice in the workplace and in the army, which has been accused of tolerating abuses of young women soldiers by generals and senior officers.</p> <p>But the gruesome murders 24 hours later have highlighted the contradictory nature of Israeli society, and the limitations of progressive laws in bringing social change.</p> <p>Women's activists say Israel is becoming an increasingly violent society - quite apart from the military's efforts to snuff out a six-month Palestinian uprising against its occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</p> <p>A report this week declared Israeli schools to be among the most violent in the world, and figures released last year say that one in five women suffer some form of domestic abuse, physical as well as verbal.</p> <p>During several weeks in the six-month intifada - including this one - more Israeli civilians have died as a result of domestic violence than drive-by shootings in the West Bank, or bombing attacks inside the borders of the Jewish state.</p> <p>\"Israel is a place of contradictions,\" said Shulamit Aloni, a veteran civil rights activist and founder of the leftwing Meretz political party. \"On the one hand, the sky is the limit for women in civil life, but we also live in a patriarchal and macho society - patriarchal because in personal status we are under the direction of the clergy which is very backward, and macho because of the army.

      "bodyText": "A day after Israeli women's activists celebrated the landmark legal verdict that convicted a former general and cabinet minister of sexual harrassment, there came a sobering reminder of what life can be like for the female population. Today's front page story is about two women killed by their partners. Brascova Kaiserman, aged 82, was bludgeoned to death with a hammer by her 90-year-old husband because he was upset with the lunch she had cooked for him in their flat in an old-peoples' home in the central town of Gedera. A few hours earlier, and a short drive away to the south, Olga Karrol, aged 30, was stabbed to death by her former partner in full view of the neighbours outside her home in Ashdod. On March 8 - International Women's Day - she had filed her second police complaint against Shliko Hundashvili in a month, accusing him of battery. Police said yesterday they had been hunting Hundashvili before the murder, but had failed to locate him. The juxtaposition of events has punctured the mood of euphoria that had greeted the conviction of a man once seen as a potential prime minister - Yitzhak Mordechai - for indecently assaulting a woman soldier under his command when he was a leading general in 1992, and for sexually harassing a party activist when he was the country's defence minister in 1996. Under Israeli law, Mordechai faces a maximum sentence of 10 years although, in practise, prison terms are far lower. Women's activists said the verdict was an important step in placing the issue of sexual harassment onto the public agenda. \"The verdict in the Mordechai case has finally buried an old and loathsome world in which sexual harassment was called legitimate courting, and sexual assault was accepted with understanding,\" said a front-page comment in the Ma'ariv newspaper. The fall from grace of so prominent a figure as Mordechai began making an impact well before his verdict was announced. Israel's network of sexual assault crisis centres received 15,000 complaints last year - nearly double the 8,000 cases reported in 1999 - as women drew courage about challenging what had once been accepted practice in the workplace and in the army, which has been accused of tolerating abuses of young women soldiers by generals and senior officers. But the gruesome murders 24 hours later have highlighted the contradictory nature of Israeli society, and the limitations of progressive laws in bringing social change. Women's activists say Israel is becoming an increasingly violent society - quite apart from the military's efforts to snuff out a six-month Palestinian uprising against its occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. A report this week declared Israeli schools to be among the most violent in the world, and figures released last year say that one in five women suffer some form of domestic abuse, physical as well as verbal. During several weeks in the six-month intifada - including this one - more Israeli civilians have died as a result of domestic violence than drive-by shootings in the West Bank, or bombing attacks inside the borders of the Jewish state. \"Israel is a place of contradictions,\" said Shulamit Aloni, a veteran civil rights activist and founder of the leftwing Meretz political party. \"On the one hand, the sky is the limit for women in civil life, but we also live in a patriarchal and macho society - patriarchal because in personal status we are under the direction of the clergy which is very backward, and macho because of the army. In this kind of society, whenever someone is not pleased with his life, or whenever he has a problem, the victim of his rage and disgust will be a woman.\" Others argue the exigencies of daily life in Israel, and the pressures on a society which has absorbed 1m new immigrants in the last decade, are also a factor in domestic violence. \"I think there is an enormous increase in violence within the family in Israel,\" said Frances Rady, a law professor at Jerusalem's Hebrew university. The increase may well be the result of various pressures: the pressure of the ongoing conflict in the West Bank and in Gaza, and the massive immigration. \"It is of course known that disorientation and economic difficulties in transition do probably increase violence.\" Both women acknowledge the Mordechai verdict as an important landmark because it has criminalised behavior that was once deemed forgivable. The question remains, will the Israeli legal system prove as effective in combatting domestic abuse? \"There was a tendency for a long time to regard family violence as not being a real crime,\" said Ms Rady. \"I am not talking so much about murder of a partner, but other forms of abuse. But now I think that is changing.\" Related special reports Israel and the Middle East Other articles More articles by Suzanne Goldenberg Useful links Government of Israel Palestinian National Authority Ehud Barak's office Yasser Arafat's office Jerusalem Post Ha'aretz Jerusalem Report US Secretary of State's office Hamas Egyptian presidency",

      "body": "<p>An unlikely juxtaposition appeared in the news pages of the Sun last week. Sandwiched between sexy shots of model-turned-singer Caprice and a story headlined 'Vice girls eaten by cannibals' peered the besuited, bespectacled image of advertising boss Martin Sorrell. Or, as Sun readers know him: 'Mr \u00a335 million'.</p> <p>The Sun told its army of loyal readers that the chief executive of the British advertising group, WPP, is set to receive the biggest bonus in business history.</p> <p>Last week's reports provided an inevitable cue for renewed discussion of fat cattery and adland excess conveniently side-stepping the more obvious question: who is he, what exactly does he do and is he worth it? </p> <p>Sorrell, 54, is chief executive of the world's third-largest marketing and communication company, which owns two of the world's biggest advertising agencies J Walter Thompson and Ogilvy &amp; Mather. It also owns a string of design, branding, PR, media, information and communication consultancies. </p> <p>More telling is the fact that Sorrell has been widely credited with revolutionising media communications and redefining notions of the traditional adman. Oh, and under his stewardship, at a time when traditional advertising agencies have faced many challenges to their business, WPP's pre-tax profits rose 20% year on year to \u00a3112.6m. </p> <p>The funny thing is that Sorrell isn't an adland creative whizz - he's never written a word of advertising copy in his life. Nor is he the 'bean counter' some critics have dismissed him as he's no accountant. What he is, however, is a business strategist, a fact which has delivered ample return to his shareholders in recent years, but which has provoked cynical rivals to sniff that his pursuit of stock market performance has downgraded the importance of creativity and advertising pedigree.</p> <p>Talk to Sorrell about his vision for the future and it's not hard to see why traditionalists might feel, well, a little peeved. </p> <p>'I prefer to use the term 'marketing communication services provider' rather than 'advertising agency',' he explains. </p> <p>'Those companies that have positioned themselves as doing more than advertising are better prepared to deal with the challenges that lie ahead. In today's business climate, clients must have a whole panoply of weapons at their disposal, and that applies to those supplying them with these services, too.' </p> <p>Much of the advertising industry is too conservative, he believes. 'Our industry's image is a modern one. We are thought of as being at the cutting edge of progress, focusing on new trends, fads, and fashions and youth. In truth we are probably more conservative than bankers or accountants or lawyers.' </p> <p>Sorrell's success has come from applying lessons learned by his agencies' clients to WPP's own business. When describing what sets WPP's approach apart from that of its competitors, he draws parallels with brand-owning businesses such as Procter &amp; Gamble and Nestle. </p> <p>'The challenges we face are the challenges faced by our clients,' he explains.'An over-capacity of brands in the marketplace, the explosion of new channels of distribution and the need for effective internal communications.'</p> <p>He is a hands-on manager, constantly touring the far reaches of an empire which extends to 92 countries and employs 33,000 staff. </p> <p>'It's no good sitting in New York or Chicago - you've got to feel the excitement,' he said recently. 'You have got to develop new ways of doing things, and new ways of thinking about things.' A key challenge, he says, is cultivating the identities of WPP's constituent companies to fuel innovation and creative thinking. </p> <p>As advertisers have grown disenchanted by the relative cost of TV airtime and new technology has offered alternatives to traditional advertising, Sorrell believes ad agencies can no longer assume theirs are the only solutions. But as he admits, many still do. </p> <p>'He recognised before many the changing demands of clients and the importance of developing an integrated, rather than advertising-led approach to brand communication,' one agency executive observes. </p> <p>Cambridge and Harvard-educated (he studied economics before taking the Harvard Business School MBA), Sorrell sounds more management consultant than adman. In fact, after completing his studies he did work as a management consultant in America, then for sports marketer Mark McCormack in London before joining Saatchi &amp; Saatchi as chief financial officer. </p> <p>By the mid-80s, he was widely credited for the Saatchis' success with his focus on the bottom line and cost control. Saatchis, however, was not his. So he decided to go it alone, acquiring a stake in Wire and Plastic Products - a small, listed company that made shopping baskets. This gave him a platform to acquire advertising and marketing businesses; initially small ones, such as direct marketing agencies, and eventually adland giants JWT and O&amp;M. </p> <p>Unfortunately, Sorrell bought O&amp;M at the worst possible time just before recession struck, bringing WPP to the brink of insolvency in the early 90s with debts of around \u00a3500m. It was at this time that he negotiated the now famous incentive scheme which required a significant investment of his own money for an eventual return linked to the company's future performance. He re-built the business. And he made a personal fortune, too - \u00a335m in bonuses over the past five years - and maybe a further \u00a330m over the next five under a new senior executives' bonus scheme proposed last week. </p> <p>Critics paint Sorrell as an adland philistine, interested only in the bottom line with little passion for the art itself. And indeed, he has described himself self-deprecatingly as 'a dull, boring little clerk'. </p> <p>Married with three children, he has homes in Hampstead and the South of France. 'He's a money man. Full stop,' one senior executive at a London ad agency sniffs. 'He might just as well be running a chain of shops, or a bank.' </p> <p>One recent report concerning the sorry state of Marks &amp; Spencer named him a possible contender for the retailer's top job. Flattering, but inaccurate, is Sorrell's response. 'Although I did once work behind the cheese counter during business school for a project.' </p> <p>Sorrell insists he is hooked on advertising and marketing. True, he ended up in it by chance. 'But as an industry, it's very similar to investment banking, or management consultancy,' he says. </p> <p>'Firstly, because it's fun. Secondly, because it's a business where virtually every commercial situation you read about in the newspapers we are involved in, with one tentacle or another. It can be any industry, any country in any part of the world, political or social issues. It's what makes it interesting and keeps you fresh. Like entertainment, or sport, you're only as good as your last campaign.' </p> <p>And as technology increases opportunities for would-be media owners, he looks forward to fresh challenges. 'We've had proposals to partner in overseas TV channels where our involvement would not be restricted, as it is in the UK. We've not done so yet. I'd not rule it out. But we would consider opportunities to invest in highly targeted, specialist media opportunities. There are tremendous opportunities with new media. With the web, everybody's a media owner. Life has changed.' </p> <p>Well to a point. For Sorrell admits: 'I'm not as wired as I should be.' And of his own media habits, he observes: 'Given the amount of travelling I now do, I'd have to say I'm consistent with anyone else in my demographic group.' By which he means he's a voracious consumer of business media, watches little TV but enjoys humorous British commercials when he can. </p> <p>'I couldn't single out any one campaign for fear of causing offence - my life wouldn't be worth living,' he says. But he does know a good ad campaign when he sees one. 'David Ogilvy (the late founder of O&amp;M) always said he didn't like humorous advertising because advertising should be there primarily to sell. Well, like [him] I believe that the best ads are the most effective ads.' </p> <p>It's common sense, after all. For even the most precious adland traditionalist would have to admit that good advertising communication makes more money than bad.</p>",

      "bodyText": "London shares rallied by nearly 100 points today, staging a comeback from yesterday's massive losses as tech and telecoms stocks shot ahead. After just an hour's trading this morning, the FTSE-100 index of leading shares jumped 94.2 points ahead to 5409. Telecom shares sparked following gains made on the US Nasdaq exchange last night, with Vodafone, Colt Telecom and BT all surging. Yesterday saw the FTSE suffer its worst percentage fall since October 1992, with billions of pounds wiped off the value of shares. The Index closed down 225.9 points at 5314.8, as investors rushed to sell off telecoms, techs and banks. But last night Wall Street staged a late recovery, closing down less than 100 points after having fallen 380 at its lowest point. The Nasdaq closed ahead by 67 points. Far Eastern markets also helped, with both the Nikkei and the Hang Seng posting overnight gains. Shares have been falling because of worries over a United States recession, jitters about the Japanese economy, and bad news updates from a number of companies. The recent plunge in stocks was seen by some as being sparked by the decision of the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, to shave just 0.5% off American interest rates - rather than the more aggressive 0.75% for which the markets had hoped. Analysts have commented that the markets are so jittery at the moment that the slightest hint of bad news is sending shares plummeting. Today was a quiet day for corporate announcements, and with no blue-chip profit warnings announced in early trading, the FTSE gained confidence. In London, the biggest movers and shakers after an hour's trading included Telewest Communications, up 13%, telecoms equipment firm Energis, posting a 9% hike, computer services firm Logica, rising 11%, and chip designer Arm, sparking 6%. Among the smaller shares, hand-held computer firm Psion rose 5%, telecoms group Thus sparked 12% ahead and software firm Autonomy was up 7%.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It never rains but it pours - or in our case this week, it snows. On Tuesday and Wednesday this week, the town was partly white, partly slushy, and almost wholly deserted. Most of the traders in the weekly open air market didn't even bother to turn out. And although the sun is shining again now, there isn't much of a silver lining behind the clouds of economic gloom.</p> <p><b>The restaurateur</b></p> <p>Brian Galbraith and partner Jan Blackburn, who run the bar-restaurant Stones in the town centre, have escaped to Lanzarote for a couple of weeks, leaving a business which is, at best, ticking over.</p> <p>On Wednesday there were a handful of customers at the bar. Yesterday there was something of a bonanza: three lunch tables occupied.</p> <p>Roy Sparry, who is looking after Stones, is more usually found at a hotel in Burford, one of the main tourist hotspots in the Cotswolds even at this time of year. But not this year: the tourists and trippers have deserted in droves, and the hotels are letting rooms at any price they can get.</p> <p>The closure of Blenheim Palace, the biggest single attraction in this part of Oxfordshire, has had a huge impact. More ominous still is the reluctance of couples and families from the cities to come into the countryside.</p> <p>Before they left, Brian and Jan's friend David Smith popped into Stones to buy them a send-off drink. He runs the Red Lion in the small somnolent village of Little Compton, between Chipping Norton and Moreton-in-Marsh.</p> <p>The pub has a deserved reputation for good food and fine beer, but no local trade to speak of. It depends on the passing trade, and on regulars who are normally more than willing to drive fair distances.</p> <p>That's all gone for the moment. Like most catering businesses around here, the Red Lion lost out badly when the Cheltenham Festival was postponed. There are no bookings for its three letting bedrooms, and scant prospects for the upcoming Mother's Day weekend - usually a time of handsome takings in the restaurant.</p> <p>David's beer order last week was his smallest in 12 years, and that is yet another ripple in the outflowing tide of lost trade: the Red Lion is tied to Donnington brewery, an old family concern with a tiny estate of just 15 countryside pubs, all presumably suffering in the tourism drought.</p> <p>Everyone has a story to tell about the depressed state of the local economy. There is the haulier who used to specialise in moving livestock, but now has utterly no business, and a brand new \u00a3250,000 truck on his hands.</p> <p>There are the caterers specialising in farm fairs and the like, whose bookings for spring and summer have evaporated.</p> <p>There are the hotel workers who are being laid off or put on part time working.</p> <p><b>The butcher </b></p> <p>Just occasionally, you hear of the handful of people actually benefiting from the crisis, like the straw contractor who is working flat out to locate and transport the material needed to fuel the ghastly animal pyres in infected districts.</p> <p>More modest, but still encouraging, is the steady increase of new customers at John Kench the butcher's shop.</p> <p>Even better, from his point of view, are the small reductions in the wholesale prices of lamb, pork and bacon, which have allowed him to restore his squeezed profit margins.</p> <p>John welcomes the new business, of course, and the changing attitudes which it portends. Customers are more conscious of quality, and want to know exactly where their food is coming from.</p> <p>But there is a downside: \"To be honest, I'm getting a bit fed up of answering the same questions all the time,\" he says ruefully. \"When it's a busy day, and you have 150 people all saying the same thing, it gets a bit wearing.\"</p> <p><b>The supermarket manager </b></p> <p>Trade is also healthy at the town's Co-op supermarket. \"Everything is running along on an even keel. We are able to offer a full range of products. Our sales are not depressed in any way, but we are not seeing any panic-buying. Prices are stable, although there has been a bit of pressure on cooked meats. On the whole, things are much as normal,\" says manager Tony Hatch.</p> <p>The Co-op, like all other local businesses, normally looks ahead to Easter and the start of the tourism season proper, for increased trade.</p> <p>This year Easter holds no such promise. The hoteliers and guest house keepers are already counting the cost of business which is lost forever, and looking ahead to the summer with apprehension.</p> <p>But at least in Chipping Norton itself there is a resident population of some 6000 people who will need food and other supplies. For them, Tony has come up with a neat little slogan: \"Stay local, and stay spending!\" <b>The farmer</b></p> <p>It's a slogan which will appeal to Marilyn Ivings, who is constantly urging consumers to support local produce. Her small herd of suckler cows at Mill Farm in Church Enstone will not be contributing to the human food chain until August, which puts Marilyn in the relatively privileged position among farmers of not having to move her animals for at least four months.</p> <p>Still, the restriction on movement is uncomfortably close to home, in a quite literal sense: the latest official boundary is the road along the side of Mill Farm. And as if that is not enough to worry about, Marilyn has received some new advice from the National Farmers Union, of which she is a stalwart member and spokeswoman.</p> <p>\"They're telling us to be aware of any unexpected packages which may arrive, and not to open them if we have any doubts.

      "bodyText": "It never rains but it pours - or in our case this week, it snows. On Tuesday and Wednesday this week, the town was partly white, partly slushy, and almost wholly deserted. Most of the traders in the weekly open air market didn't even bother to turn out. And although the sun is shining again now, there isn't much of a silver lining behind the clouds of economic gloom. The restaurateur Brian Galbraith and partner Jan Blackburn, who run the bar-restaurant Stones in the town centre, have escaped to Lanzarote for a couple of weeks, leaving a business which is, at best, ticking over. On Wednesday there were a handful of customers at the bar. Yesterday there was something of a bonanza: three lunch tables occupied. Roy Sparry, who is looking after Stones, is more usually found at a hotel in Burford, one of the main tourist hotspots in the Cotswolds even at this time of year. But not this year: the tourists and trippers have deserted in droves, and the hotels are letting rooms at any price they can get. The closure of Blenheim Palace, the biggest single attraction in this part of Oxfordshire, has had a huge impact. More ominous still is the reluctance of couples and families from the cities to come into the countryside. Before they left, Brian and Jan's friend David Smith popped into Stones to buy them a send-off drink. He runs the Red Lion in the small somnolent village of Little Compton, between Chipping Norton and Moreton-in-Marsh. The pub has a deserved reputation for good food and fine beer, but no local trade to speak of. It depends on the passing trade, and on regulars who are normally more than willing to drive fair distances. That's all gone for the moment. Like most catering businesses around here, the Red Lion lost out badly when the Cheltenham Festival was postponed. There are no bookings for its three letting bedrooms, and scant prospects for the upcoming Mother's Day weekend - usually a time of handsome takings in the restaurant. David's beer order last week was his smallest in 12 years, and that is yet another ripple in the outflowing tide of lost trade: the Red Lion is tied to Donnington brewery, an old family concern with a tiny estate of just 15 countryside pubs, all presumably suffering in the tourism drought. Everyone has a story to tell about the depressed state of the local economy. There is the haulier who used to specialise in moving livestock, but now has utterly no business, and a brand new \u00a3250,000 truck on his hands. There are the caterers specialising in farm fairs and the like, whose bookings for spring and summer have evaporated. There are the hotel workers who are being laid off or put on part time working. The butcher Just occasionally, you hear of the handful of people actually benefiting from the crisis, like the straw contractor who is working flat out to locate and transport the material needed to fuel the ghastly animal pyres in infected districts. More modest, but still encouraging, is the steady increase of new customers at John Kench the butcher's shop. Even better, from his point of view, are the small reductions in the wholesale prices of lamb, pork and bacon, which have allowed him to restore his squeezed profit margins. John welcomes the new business, of course, and the changing attitudes which it portends. Customers are more conscious of quality, and want to know exactly where their food is coming from. But there is a downside: \"To be honest, I'm getting a bit fed up of answering the same questions all the time,\" he says ruefully. \"When it's a busy day, and you have 150 people all saying the same thing, it gets a bit wearing.\" The supermarket manager Trade is also healthy at the town's Co-op supermarket. \"Everything is running along on an even keel. We are able to offer a full range of products. Our sales are not depressed in any way, but we are not seeing any panic-buying. Prices are stable, although there has been a bit of pressure on cooked meats. On the whole, things are much as normal,\" says manager Tony Hatch. The Co-op, like all other local businesses, normally looks ahead to Easter and the start of the tourism season proper, for increased trade. This year Easter holds no such promise. The hoteliers and guest house keepers are already counting the cost of business which is lost forever, and looking ahead to the summer with apprehension. But at least in Chipping Norton itself there is a resident population of some 6000 people who will need food and other supplies. For them, Tony has come up with a neat little slogan: \"Stay local, and stay spending!\" The farmer It's a slogan which will appeal to Marilyn Ivings, who is constantly urging consumers to support local produce. Her small herd of suckler cows at Mill Farm in Church Enstone will not be contributing to the human food chain until August, which puts Marilyn in the relatively privileged position among farmers of not having to move her animals for at least four months. Still, the restriction on movement is uncomfortably close to home, in a quite literal sense: the latest official boundary is the road along the side of Mill Farm. And as if that is not enough to worry about, Marilyn has received some new advice from the National Farmers Union, of which she is a stalwart member and spokeswoman. \"They're telling us to be aware of any unexpected packages which may arrive, and not to open them if we have any doubts. It seems they have been told that anyone speaking out in favour of the cordon sanitaire operation (the culling of healthy animals in areas vulnerable to infection) could be getting some unwelcome attention,\" she said. It seems extraordinary that now, of all times, farmers should be obliged to think about the potential threat from animal 'welfare' extremists. But then these are extraordinary times in the countryside. dbrown445@aol.com What's going on?

      "bodyText": "John Major, the former prime minister, today laid down an ultimatum to Tony Blair over the timing of a general election, telling the current premier not to go to the country unless he was sure the foot and mouth epidemic was under control. In a move designed to turn up the political pressure on Mr Blair as he decides whether or not to go for a May 3 poll - the same date as the local elections - the former PM pleaded that two stringent tests must be met if a general election is called. The tests are that the foot and mouth disease is under control, and that Labour ministers will be able to devote as much time to tackling the epidemic as if there were no campaigning. Mr Major said: \"The prime minister still seems determined to proceed as if all were serene in the countryside. \"The government and its spin doctors are now advancing the truly ludicrous notion that, were the planned local elections for May 3 to be delayed , it would highlight the crisis and thereby damage the tourism industry.\" Although Mr Major - who will himself retire as an MP at the next election - falls short of calling for the general election to be postponed indefinitely, his demands would appear designed to rule out a May 3 date. He adds: \"I look at the blank, fearful faces of the farmers and my heart bleeds for them: it seems malign fate is forever lying in wait for to bat them around the ears.\" Mr Major's voice of concern is added to that of the newly-formed Electoral Commission, whose job is to ensure elections are carried out in a \"free and fair\" manner. Sam Younger, the chairman of the commission, yesterday expressed concern that postal services would be functioning properly across rural areas, for those voters who have chosen to use a postal vote. Although technically the prime minister does not need to call an election until the end of May 2002, all three parties have geared up so-called \"war rooms\" at their London head offices for a May 3 contest. The last date for announcing a May 3 general election would be April 5.

Up to 40 tonnes of debris from the space station safely plunged into the sea hundreds of miles south-east of Fiji at 5.58am UK time. The space station made a spectacular display in the sky as it burned up in the atmosphere, with a golden light show above Fiji. Nobody was thought to have been injured at sea as Mir made its final descent. Most of the 150-tonne spacecraft had already burned up as it re-entered Earth's atmosphere, while the remainder broke up into as many as 1,500 chunks, some as big as a small car. Two planes carrying people who had paid a total of \u00a31.4m to see the re-entry were thought to be the closest to the splash-down site, although as many as 30 fishing boats were also in the area. Mir's watery grave ended a journey of more than 2bn miles, which had seen it play host to 104 cosmonauts from around the world, and set the record for the longest space stay, at 438 days. It had been seen by eyewitnesses on Fiji 15 minutes before the end in a display which CNN reporter Hugh Williams said was \"unbelievable\". \"The Mir came streaking across the horizon in five, six, seven, maybe nine pieces making a huge golden trail,\" he said. \"The people here were just in awe.

Pop Idol is similar to Popstars in that a panel of experts will choose a shortlist from open auditions across the UK that are expected to draw thousands of hopefuls looking for fame. But after that the public will get to vote on which individual gets a shot at pop stardom. The winner will be offered a deal with former Spice Girls manager Simon Fuller's 19 Management and a recording contract with RCA. \"After the phenomenal success of Popstars it will be wonderful to give our viewers the chance to decide who should be next for pop stardom,\" said Claudia Rosencrantz, ITV controller of entertainment. Pop Idol will be made by Pearson Television and 19 TV, a subsidiary of Mr Fuller's 19 Group. The format was created by Mr Fuller, who now manages S Club 7 and Annie Lennox, and Simon Cowell, the RCA A&amp;R executive responsible for Westlife, Five and Robson and Jerome. The pair will be closely involved in choosing the shortlist for Pop Idol. The programme will be supported by a multimedia marketing campaign across TV, radio, press and the internet. Pearson TV chief executive of UK production Alan Boyd will executive produce the show. Related story Mar 19: Popstars on song with 7m viewers",

His career began at Procter &amp; Gamble where he worked on brands including Ariel, Fairy Liquid and Pampers.

The brewer has now restructured its board, with Mr Gilliland replacing Miles Templeman, who will continue to advise Interbrew UK as an external consultant. The new board comprises Whitbread and Interbrew executives because Interbrew is being forced by the UK competition authorities to sell off the Bass business it acquired for \u00a32.3bn last June.

      "body": "<p>Sandy Bruce-Lockhart, the leader of Kent county council, prides himself on being a thinking politician. That is why - purely in the spirit of intellectual inquiry - he enlivened a meeting of the Local Government Association by asking Peter Mandelson how ministers could be either convincing or consistent if they were not guided by a coherent ideology.</p> <p>The former Northern Ireland secretary replied that he was not prepared to answer that, or any other question, from so prejudiced a source. But, despite feeling \"bruised\" by the rebuff, Mr Bruce-Lockhart remained a seeker after truth. When Hillary Armstrong, the minister for local government, visited the south-east of England regional assembly last July, he invited her to define \"economic, social and environmental well-being\" - the happy state which the white paper on local government requires councils to encourage.</p> <p>According to Mr Bruce-Lockhart's paraphrase, Ms Armstrong replied that the meaning of the phrase was \"in the head of the beholder\" - a view which he decided, after some careful thought, he shared. He has worked out how he wants it to be beheld in Kent. At a time when the old certainties - church, royalty, family - no longer hold society together, local government must engender \"a sense of purpose, a sense of order, a sense of community and a sense of belonging\". That aspiration is not in the down-to-earth tradition of local government. But Mr Bruce-Lockhart can provide a practical example of how his objective is being achieved.</p> <p>\"There are already places around the United Kingdom where regeneration - city development - has brought a vitality, a vibrancy into town centres and created a sense of civic pride which is tangible.\"</p> <p>That - as Mr Bruce-Lockhart, \"a great admirer of Albert Bore\", gladly concedes - is an exact description of what the City of Birmingham, whose council Mr Bore leads, hopes it has achieved in its urban renewal initiative. When the Tory leader of England's largest county council endorses the municipal philosophy of the Labour leader in England's second city, the idea of \"new local government\" creating its own agenda for general \"improvement\" has to be taken seriously. But the pattern of change cannot be the same in town and country.

Councillor Cheryl Hall, the leader of Kent's Labour minority, attributes the crisis to a combination of financial incompetence and doctrinal prejudice. She cites, as her example of the second failing, the decision to privatise 92 of Kent's 96 link services centres, or residential homes as they might be called in other counties. A consultation on their future produced a vast majority of the 30,000 people polled for continued public ownership. Two letters said sell. The council sold. It seemed an easy way to save money. Wages are lower in the private sector. Unfortunately for the council, they were not low enough to avoid a financial crisis.</p> <p><b> Conflict</b><br></p> <p>There are 18,000 residential care beds in Kent. Peter Gilroy, the county director of social services, speaks of them in the language of the market. One third are \"bought\" privately. An equal number is \"purchased\" by neighbouring local authorities. Kent county council \"procures\" the rest. That in itself puts the county council in a seller's market. Minimum wage legislation and the European Union's working time directive began to bite just as he was \"reletting his contracts\". As wages have risen, so have the cost of both beds and domiciliary care and Mr Gilroy complains that the Treasury's insistence on \"best value\" makes no allowances for the high wage levels of the south-east. His success is judged against 100 \"performance indicators\" - most of which, he says, are \"not performance driven\". That is to say the Treasury is interested in price not product. He is left to resolve the conflict between cost and quality.</p> <p>That difficulty of reconciling savings and service is not exclusive to the provision of residential care. Many of the grants, which Kent receives, are \"hypothecated\" for spending on specific schemes. \"The grant rules are highly prescriptive,\" says Mr Bruce-Lockhart. As a result, the council is denied the flexibility which would allow it to shuttle payments between projects and it loses \"the capacity to innovate and develop improved ways of providing service\".</p> <p>The only way Kent could reduce its social services deficit was to change the \"eligibility criteria\" - some needy people received less, others nothing at all. The implication is that, left to itself, Kent would have done more and better. That is by no means certain. The Next Five Years contained assurances that Kent county council is \"committed to assisting those who need our help\". The government, in reply, will argue that public sector agreements are intended to transform the platitudes of local propaganda into real improvement in services.</p> <p>For Kent, there is no real alternative to dancing at least to some of the government's tunes. Its future prosperity depends in great part on the completion of the high speed rail link between London and the Channel Tunnel. East and north Kent are nothing like as prosperous as the south of the county. The east Kent coalfield has closed. The navy's decision to abandon Chatham dockyard cost 20,000 jobs in a single day. All hopes are now built around the completion of the Thames gateway project which will, in the council's estimate, attract 50,000 jobs to Kent and justify the building of 30,000 houses at Ebbsfleet in what will then amount to a new town just outside Dartford.</p> <p>Everybody wants phase two of the rail link to begin as promised in 2002 - a year before phase one is finished. In mid-January ministers renewed their assurance that it would start on time and that the council would be allowed to increase its contingent debt by borrowing part of the cost for whatever related infrastructure projects were needed.</p> <p>Even co-operation in schemes which are essentially part of a national programme is likely to come accompanied by what Mr Bruce-Lockhart calls \"strings\". He lists five different types of restraint - \"planning, guidance, regulation, inspection and prescribed bidding\", the process by which councils compete to win government grants for special schemes.</p> <p>Kent feels particularly oppressed by the need to take part in a whole series of planning exercises. The local transport plan \"has to be completed in a high degree of detail, right down to the traffic calming scheme in Folkestone\". The education asset management survey required officers to measure classrooms in pursuit of 560,000 separate pieces of information. That work cost the council \u00a3150,000 and took 20 hours to email to the Department for Education (DfEE). It is an exercise of that sort which the Kent council leader believes is \"diminishing diversity in local government\". But he cannot be surprised by the DfEE's desire to keep a watchful eye on Kent schools. Kent education is at the centre of a long-running controversy.</p> <p>Arguments about the quality of Kent secondary schools are embittered by the failure of two attempts to end selective education in the county. During the coalition years, the Lib-Lab majority submitted a proposal for the introduction of comprehensive education. It was turned down by the Tory government. Then, when Labour won the 1997 election, campaigners took the promise to \"let parents decide\" at its face value - only to discover that the regulations governing the parental ballot were too heavily biased in favour of the status quo to make change possible.</p> <p>A year ago, the Sunday Times published a table of what it called the top education authorities. It was based on the location of the 250 schools which achieved the best GCSE results. Kent headed the list with 32. Nick Henwood, the county's education officer, dismisses the claim to supremacy as \"about as valid as comments about the number of schools in the bottom 250\" - a category in which Kent also figures prominently. In 20% of Kent secondary schools, less than a quarter of the students achieve five or more A* to C GCSE passes. Mr Henwood describes the county average as \"the best indicator I know\". In 2000, a little more than 50% of the secondary students who were entered for the examination obtained five or more GCSEs at grade C or above. The national average was 49.2%. Almost 96% achieved at least one GCSE at Grade C or above. The national average was 94%. But comparisons of percentage passes are not a wholly reliable guide. They are influenced by the decision of some counties to enter everybody in the appropriate age group for the examination while others avoid future embarrassment by eliminating no-hopers. On the basis of Mr Henwood's chosen indicator, Kent's achievement is statistically just about adequate.</p> <p>However, the county's critics claim Kent should do better. John Studley, head of Our Lady of Hartley, the top performing primary school in the county, says: \"There are some good grammar schools in Kent. But with their staff and resources you would expect them to produce far better results than they achieve.\" In any case: \"The problem is for the 75% of pupils who do not get a grammar school place. He is not alone in his concern. Although the number of \"failing schools\", subject to Ofsted \"special measures\", has fallen from 11 to seven, Kent tops the league in the calculation of second order failure. Last year, education minister Baroness Blackstone told the House of Lords that Kent had \"the highest number of schools in the country with serious weaknesses\". Her comment was based on the Ofsted report which revealed, in its general examination of the whole education authority, that \"the number of schools which have serious weaknesses have risen from 12 to 33\". Clearly, the DfEE still believes Kent has special problems. When a couple of months ago it distributed extra funds to improve \"weaker schools\", Kent received more than any other authority. It works out at almost \u00a320 per pupil, almost twice as much as comparable counties.</p> <p><b> Class divide</b><br></p> <p>Professor David Jesson, of York University, has produced the one objective analysis of Kent's examination results. He concludes that \"in comparison with similar schools\" some Kent grammar schools are \"quite strikingly underperforming\". He adds that \"Kent already has more than its fair share of failing schools\". His judgment that \"selective education systems fail to deliver the same levels of performance as those organised on comprehensive lines\" will remain a matter of dispute within the county. But one thing is certain about the selective system as it works in Kent. It deepens the class divide. In some of the county's high schools (secondary modern in fact, if not in name) over 40% of the students qualify for free school meals. There is not one grammar school in which the free school meal entitlement totals 5%.</p> <p>The Ofsted report - dealing with the allegation that \"selection has adverse effects\" on the county's education observes that \"the inspection team cannot comment on the principle of selection which is the council's policy and beyond our remit\". That conclusion - correct as a question of fact though it may be - implies that the council has the power to decide how its secondary schools are organised. In fact, that is no longer so. The pattern of secondary education is in theory decided by parents. In practice, it is determined by DfEE decisions to create specialist schools and to allow individual heads to introduce an element of selection into their entrance criteria. Kent remains selective because that is Whitehall's wish.</p> <p>Robbed of their traditional powers, Kent councillors cast about to find ways in which they can pursue the diversity which is the essence of local government. Some of the policies which the Tory group hopes will emphasise the county's unique character will be regarded as idiosyncratic in other authorities.</p> <p>Kent county council announced that, if clause 28 were repealed, it would devise its own method of preventing the dissemination of \"homosexual propaganda\" in schools, and it refused to take part in a pilot scheme to test the demand for \"baby-naming\" as an alternative to christening.</p> <p>Council officials reported that the authority was ready and able to be one of the 12 pioneer authorities who tested the popularity of the secular ceremony. But the ruling Conservative group first said that costs were too high, then added that it was still uncertain if the Westminster government would contribute towards the additional expenditure and finally ex plained: \"We feel the government is gradually nibbling away at all the institutions of our country and we are destroying some of them, which is sad.\" The \"sense of purpose, sense of order and sense of community\" in which Mr Bruce-Lockhart believes is built on traditional values.</p> <p>There is no doubt that those values are shared by much of the county. And that ethos makes Kent an inhospitable refuge for the asylum seekers who land there. Mr Bruce-Lockhart puts the objectors' case in moderate terms. It was, he says, unfair that Kent should bear so much of the financial burden. Even now that the Home Office has agreed to meet the \u00a350m that accommodating the refugees costs each year, the money will be refunded in arrears. So Kent council taxpayers will be have to pay the interest on the borrowed money. The essential reasonableness of his approach is emphasised by an expression of concern about juvenile asylum seekers who travel without adult companions. \"Humanity requires them to be dealt with more quickly.\" But his compassion does not characterise the attitude for all his colleagues.</p> <p>Councillor Keith Ferrin, Mr Bruce-Lockhart's deputy, expresses the county's concern rather differently. \"By far the greatest number of asylum seekers in Kent are brought in by highly organised criminal gangs. It's also quite likely that there are a number of young women among them, being brought into Britain to act as sex slaves and prostitutes. Welcome to Tony Blair's Britain. It may not be everybody's idea of heaven but it is for another 200 asylum seekers in Kent alone every month.\" Mr Bruce-Lockhart says the Ferrin outburst resulted in \"a great deal of straight talking\" - by which, we must assume, he meant a dressing-down. But it is not the only subject on which Councillor Ferrin chooses to argue with his leaders.</p> <p>Mr Bruce-Lockhart, sensitive to the suggestion that he leads a divided party, emphasises that he has only lost one vote in the \"cabinet\" which acts as Kent's executive authority. But there was clearly a great deal of private agonising over the decision to sign the public service agreements with the Whitehall government. And the creation of a \"cabinet system\" - as advocated in the local government white paper - was only formally endorsed after a strange procedure which suggests that arms had to be twisted, if not actually broken. Tory councillors who attacked the idea at the May council meeting voted to adopt it in July.</p> <p>Rhetorical questions are now being asked far beyond Kent. \"We used to have committees responsible for policies and recommendations - what is wrong with that?\" The government's answer that \"there is a strong argument for separating the executive and representational functions\" is far too theoretical a justification to appeal to most councillors - particularly in Kent where there is a strong feeling that the urge \"to be a leading edge authority on every subject\" is tying county hall too tightly to Whitehall's \"modernising agenda\". But Kent is not always at the leading edge. When the cabinet system was agreed, the council determined that it should meet in private.</p> <p>Perhaps Mr Bruce-Lockhart believes that willing acquiescence to the \"modernising agenda\" is the price that the county council has to pay for its survival. When Kent's future was last examined, the local government commissioner initially favoured the creation of seven new \"all purpose\" authorities made up of amalgamated districts - Dartford and Gravesend in the north, the Medway Towns of Rochester, Chatham and Gillingham, and Folkestone with Dover on the coast. In the end only one new metropolitan district, the Medway Towns, was carved out of the county. Kent, and the Tory majority on its county council, were saved.</p> <p>Satisfaction with how the council works and what is done is hard to measure. Four years ago local and national elections were held on the same day, producing a turnout in the council poll of over 70%. The council's own polls show no enthusiasm for the council itself but approval of much of what the council has achieved and is attempting.</p> <p>The only sensible assumption is that in Kent, as in the rest of the country, most people hardly think about local government at all - until they are directly affected by one of its failures.</p> <p><b> Kent facts &amp; figures</b><br></p> <p>\u0095 The population is 1,332,000</p> <p>\u0095 Kent covers an area of 352,296 hectares</p> <p>\u0095 It is the largest county council in the UK.

      "bodyText": "Sandy Bruce-Lockhart, the leader of Kent county council, prides himself on being a thinking politician. That is why - purely in the spirit of intellectual inquiry - he enlivened a meeting of the Local Government Association by asking Peter Mandelson how ministers could be either convincing or consistent if they were not guided by a coherent ideology. The former Northern Ireland secretary replied that he was not prepared to answer that, or any other question, from so prejudiced a source. But, despite feeling \"bruised\" by the rebuff, Mr Bruce-Lockhart remained a seeker after truth. When Hillary Armstrong, the minister for local government, visited the south-east of England regional assembly last July, he invited her to define \"economic, social and environmental well-being\" - the happy state which the white paper on local government requires councils to encourage. According to Mr Bruce-Lockhart's paraphrase, Ms Armstrong replied that the meaning of the phrase was \"in the head of the beholder\" - a view which he decided, after some careful thought, he shared. He has worked out how he wants it to be beheld in Kent. At a time when the old certainties - church, royalty, family - no longer hold society together, local government must engender \"a sense of purpose, a sense of order, a sense of community and a sense of belonging\". That aspiration is not in the down-to-earth tradition of local government. But Mr Bruce-Lockhart can provide a practical example of how his objective is being achieved. \"There are already places around the United Kingdom where regeneration - city development - has brought a vitality, a vibrancy into town centres and created a sense of civic pride which is tangible.\" That - as Mr Bruce-Lockhart, \"a great admirer of Albert Bore\", gladly concedes - is an exact description of what the City of Birmingham, whose council Mr Bore leads, hopes it has achieved in its urban renewal initiative. When the Tory leader of England's largest county council endorses the municipal philosophy of the Labour leader in England's second city, the idea of \"new local government\" creating its own agenda for general \"improvement\" has to be taken seriously. But the pattern of change cannot be the same in town and country. Kent county council, in the new century as in the old, will have to share what power local government retains, with the 12 borough and district councils within its boundaries. Partnerships This year the Kent county council plans to spend \u00a31,267m - basically in three areas. Education (together with libraries) will account for more than half, social services for more than a quarter and strategic planning (which includes the management of the roads programme) for something like 10%. The boroughs and districts - from Dover, through leafy Sevenoaks to the virtual London suburb of Dartford - provide the other local services. They also collect the 25% of the county council's income which is directly contributed by local citizens. The Treasury contributes twice as much.

Its future prosperity depends in great part on the completion of the high speed rail link between London and the Channel Tunnel. East and north Kent are nothing like as prosperous as the south of the county. The east Kent coalfield has closed. The navy's decision to abandon Chatham dockyard cost 20,000 jobs in a single day. All hopes are now built around the completion of the Thames gateway project which will, in the council's estimate, attract 50,000 jobs to Kent and justify the building of 30,000 houses at Ebbsfleet in what will then amount to a new town just outside Dartford. Everybody wants phase two of the rail link to begin as promised in 2002 - a year before phase one is finished. In mid-January ministers renewed their assurance that it would start on time and that the council would be allowed to increase its contingent debt by borrowing part of the cost for whatever related infrastructure projects were needed. Even co-operation in schemes which are essentially part of a national programme is likely to come accompanied by what Mr Bruce-Lockhart calls \"strings\". He lists five different types of restraint - \"planning, guidance, regulation, inspection and prescribed bidding\", the process by which councils compete to win government grants for special schemes. Kent feels particularly oppressed by the need to take part in a whole series of planning exercises. The local transport plan \"has to be completed in a high degree of detail, right down to the traffic calming scheme in Folkestone\". The education asset management survey required officers to measure classrooms in pursuit of 560,000 separate pieces of information. That work cost the council \u00a3150,000 and took 20 hours to email to the Department for Education (DfEE). It is an exercise of that sort which the Kent council leader believes is \"diminishing diversity in local government\". But he cannot be surprised by the DfEE's desire to keep a watchful eye on Kent schools. Kent education is at the centre of a long-running controversy. Arguments about the quality of Kent secondary schools are embittered by the failure of two attempts to end selective education in the county. During the coalition years, the Lib-Lab majority submitted a proposal for the introduction of comprehensive education. It was turned down by the Tory government. Then, when Labour won the 1997 election, campaigners took the promise to \"let parents decide\" at its face value - only to discover that the regulations governing the parental ballot were too heavily biased in favour of the status quo to make change possible. A year ago, the Sunday Times published a table of what it called the top education authorities. It was based on the location of the 250 schools which achieved the best GCSE results. Kent headed the list with 32. Nick Henwood, the county's education officer, dismisses the claim to supremacy as \"about as valid as comments about the number of schools in the bottom 250\" - a category in which Kent also figures prominently. In 20% of Kent secondary schools, less than a quarter of the students achieve five or more A* to C GCSE passes. Mr Henwood describes the county average as \"the best indicator I know\". In 2000, a little more than 50% of the secondary students who were entered for the examination obtained five or more GCSEs at grade C or above. The national average was 49.2%. Almost 96% achieved at least one GCSE at Grade C or above. The national average was 94%. But comparisons of percentage passes are not a wholly reliable guide. They are influenced by the decision of some counties to enter everybody in the appropriate age group for the examination while others avoid future embarrassment by eliminating no-hopers. On the basis of Mr Henwood's chosen indicator, Kent's achievement is statistically just about adequate. However, the county's critics claim Kent should do better. John Studley, head of Our Lady of Hartley, the top performing primary school in the county, says: \"There are some good grammar schools in Kent. But with their staff and resources you would expect them to produce far better results than they achieve.\" In any case: \"The problem is for the 75% of pupils who do not get a grammar school place. He is not alone in his concern. Although the number of \"failing schools\", subject to Ofsted \"special measures\", has fallen from 11 to seven, Kent tops the league in the calculation of second order failure. Last year, education minister Baroness Blackstone told the House of Lords that Kent had \"the highest number of schools in the country with serious weaknesses\". Her comment was based on the Ofsted report which revealed, in its general examination of the whole education authority, that \"the number of schools which have serious weaknesses have risen from 12 to 33\". Clearly, the DfEE still believes Kent has special problems. When a couple of months ago it distributed extra funds to improve \"weaker schools\", Kent received more than any other authority. It works out at almost \u00a320 per pupil, almost twice as much as comparable counties. Class divide Professor David Jesson, of York University, has produced the one objective analysis of Kent's examination results. He concludes that \"in comparison with similar schools\" some Kent grammar schools are \"quite strikingly underperforming\". He adds that \"Kent already has more than its fair share of failing schools\". His judgment that \"selective education systems fail to deliver the same levels of performance as those organised on comprehensive lines\" will remain a matter of dispute within the county. But one thing is certain about the selective system as it works in Kent. It deepens the class divide. In some of the county's high schools (secondary modern in fact, if not in name) over 40% of the students qualify for free school meals. There is not one grammar school in which the free school meal entitlement totals 5%. The Ofsted report - dealing with the allegation that \"selection has adverse effects\" on the county's education observes that \"the inspection team cannot comment on the principle of selection which is the council's policy and beyond our remit\". That conclusion - correct as a question of fact though it may be - implies that the council has the power to decide how its secondary schools are organised. In fact, that is no longer so. The pattern of secondary education is in theory decided by parents. In practice, it is determined by DfEE decisions to create specialist schools and to allow individual heads to introduce an element of selection into their entrance criteria. Kent remains selective because that is Whitehall's wish. Robbed of their traditional powers, Kent councillors cast about to find ways in which they can pursue the diversity which is the essence of local government. Some of the policies which the Tory group hopes will emphasise the county's unique character will be regarded as idiosyncratic in other authorities. Kent county council announced that, if clause 28 were repealed, it would devise its own method of preventing the dissemination of \"homosexual propaganda\" in schools, and it refused to take part in a pilot scheme to test the demand for \"baby-naming\" as an alternative to christening. Council officials reported that the authority was ready and able to be one of the 12 pioneer authorities who tested the popularity of the secular ceremony. But the ruling Conservative group first said that costs were too high, then added that it was still uncertain if the Westminster government would contribute towards the additional expenditure and finally ex plained: \"We feel the government is gradually nibbling away at all the institutions of our country and we are destroying some of them, which is sad.\" The \"sense of purpose, sense of order and sense of community\" in which Mr Bruce-Lockhart believes is built on traditional values. There is no doubt that those values are shared by much of the county. And that ethos makes Kent an inhospitable refuge for the asylum seekers who land there. Mr Bruce-Lockhart puts the objectors' case in moderate terms. It was, he says, unfair that Kent should bear so much of the financial burden. Even now that the Home Office has agreed to meet the \u00a350m that accommodating the refugees costs each year, the money will be refunded in arrears. So Kent council taxpayers will be have to pay the interest on the borrowed money. The essential reasonableness of his approach is emphasised by an expression of concern about juvenile asylum seekers who travel without adult companions. \"Humanity requires them to be dealt with more quickly.\" But his compassion does not characterise the attitude for all his colleagues. Councillor Keith Ferrin, Mr Bruce-Lockhart's deputy, expresses the county's concern rather differently. \"By far the greatest number of asylum seekers in Kent are brought in by highly organised criminal gangs. It's also quite likely that there are a number of young women among them, being brought into Britain to act as sex slaves and prostitutes. Welcome to Tony Blair's Britain. It may not be everybody's idea of heaven but it is for another 200 asylum seekers in Kent alone every month.\" Mr Bruce-Lockhart says the Ferrin outburst resulted in \"a great deal of straight talking\" - by which, we must assume, he meant a dressing-down. But it is not the only subject on which Councillor Ferrin chooses to argue with his leaders. Mr Bruce-Lockhart, sensitive to the suggestion that he leads a divided party, emphasises that he has only lost one vote in the \"cabinet\" which acts as Kent's executive authority. But there was clearly a great deal of private agonising over the decision to sign the public service agreements with the Whitehall government. And the creation of a \"cabinet system\" - as advocated in the local government white paper - was only formally endorsed after a strange procedure which suggests that arms had to be twisted, if not actually broken. Tory councillors who attacked the idea at the May council meeting voted to adopt it in July. Rhetorical questions are now being asked far beyond Kent. \"We used to have committees responsible for policies and recommendations - what is wrong with that?\" The government's answer that \"there is a strong argument for separating the executive and representational functions\" is far too theoretical a justification to appeal to most councillors - particularly in Kent where there is a strong feeling that the urge \"to be a leading edge authority on every subject\" is tying county hall too tightly to Whitehall's \"modernising agenda\". But Kent is not always at the leading edge. When the cabinet system was agreed, the council determined that it should meet in private. Perhaps Mr Bruce-Lockhart believes that willing acquiescence to the \"modernising agenda\" is the price that the county council has to pay for its survival. When Kent's future was last examined, the local government commissioner initially favoured the creation of seven new \"all purpose\" authorities made up of amalgamated districts - Dartford and Gravesend in the north, the Medway Towns of Rochester, Chatham and Gillingham, and Folkestone with Dover on the coast. In the end only one new metropolitan district, the Medway Towns, was carved out of the county. Kent, and the Tory majority on its county council, were saved. Satisfaction with how the council works and what is done is hard to measure. Four years ago local and national elections were held on the same day, producing a turnout in the council poll of over 70%. The council's own polls show no enthusiasm for the council itself but approval of much of what the council has achieved and is attempting. The only sensible assumption is that in Kent, as in the rest of the country, most people hardly think about local government at all - until they are directly affected by one of its failures.

But he insisted that generous help must be matched by willingness to restructure that last great bastion of subsidy.</p> <p>Slowly, farming is indeed restructuring. Britain is taking the lead in switching spending from food production - frequently, overproduction - which consumes half the EU budget, to supporting the broader rural economy.</p> <p>This is becoming far more important to the countryside than agriculture - although the hysterical overreaction to the foot and mouth outbreak makes you wonder where priorities lie in Whitehall when panic sets in. Tourism, which stands to lose\u00a3250m a week, is on its knees. The Youth Hostels Association, that pillar of budget travel for the young and cash-strapped, is facing its biggest crisis. Small businesses are approaching bankruptcy.</p> <p>The localised impact of foot and mouth - a personal tragedy for farmers involved - should not be underestimated. But our view of farming is often locked in a romantic time-warp of Clydesdales leisurely pulling a plough, smiling shepherds coaxing herds of sheep along narrow lanes, cows grazing contentedly in the pasture and milk churns (long since disappeared) awaiting collection at the farm gate.</p> <p>When the story of this latest crisis is finally told, the reality might dawn that some livestock, particularly pigs fed on swill from questionable sources, might have been kept in conditions (how can we put it?) far from ideal. The agencies supposed to monitor animal welfare, their ranks currently depleted, might have some explaining to do. But in the wider context, this disease outbreak is certain to stimulate a serious debate about the kind of farming we want on the countryside we apparently hold so dear.</p> <p>Labour has been plagued by protesting farmers who seemed strangely absent during the final years of the last administration. On the back of the clash over hunting, this government has been blamed for so many rural ills that you would think no farms went bankrupt, village schools, bus services or post offices closed - and, most importantly, no council houses were given away at rock bottom prices in areas desperately short of low cost homes - under John Major or Margaret Thatcher.</p> <p>In truth the rapid growth of out of town superstores in the 80s and 90s, courtesy of a free-market planning regime, did more to damage country high streets and undermine village shops than any high-handed action by Tony Blair.</p> <p>Farmers, sure, have had a rough time with collapsing incomes on the back of the BSE crisis, the big supermarket chains squeezing margins, and now foot and mouth. What the industry rarely tells you, however, is that this recession followed the bonanza years of the mid-90s when takings were at a near-record high, ranking alongside the early 70s when Britain joined the then Common Market and an over-generous subsidy regime kicked in. From this high, the much-quoted 70% fall in farming incomes since the mid-90s (the reason for Tony Blair's largesse a year ago) seems less severe.</p> <p>Most analysts seem to agree that agriculture's overwhelming problem has not been the BSE crisis (largely paid for by the taxpayer), or greedy superstores, but the strength of the pound against the euro which has undermined exports and - more importantly - effectively reduced the EU subsidy, which is set in euros; when the pound was weak in the early to mid-90s, these subsidies - and consequently farming incomes - soared.</p> <p>None of this, of course, helps farming out of its present plight; since the mid-90s alone, about 20,000 farmers have left the land, bringing their numbers to about 353,000. We can be sure that, in the next year or so, many more will disappear - to do what?</p> <p>Well, maybe diversify, with more cash from a much despised common agricultural policy being diverted into the wider rural economy - and the real world. Fifteen months' ago, the Cabinet Office produced a lengthy report urging the government to get real and sweep away a price support framework developed after the last war which had little relevance to the new century.</p> <p>After the present turmoil, a radical government might finally address that last bastion of statism which has somehow remained aloof from the realities of the market place. By then, however, a lot more government cash will have flowed from Whitehall to bail out the victims of this latest crisis.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:peter.hetherington@theguardian.com\">peter.hetherington@theguardian.com</a><br><br><b>What's going on?</b><br><a href=\"     http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,443686,00.html\">Full list: outbreaks </a><br> <a href=\"     http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,460510,00.html\">Full list: closed &amp; cancelled</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html  \">Causes and effects</a></p> <p><b>The front line</b><br> <a href=\"     http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,459872,00.html\">20.03.2001: Looking forward to easter, nervously</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html  \">06.03.2001: Meet our panel</a><br>What is the situation on the ground?

Small businesses are approaching bankruptcy. The localised impact of foot and mouth - a personal tragedy for farmers involved - should not be underestimated. But our view of farming is often locked in a romantic time-warp of Clydesdales leisurely pulling a plough, smiling shepherds coaxing herds of sheep along narrow lanes, cows grazing contentedly in the pasture and milk churns (long since disappeared) awaiting collection at the farm gate. When the story of this latest crisis is finally told, the reality might dawn that some livestock, particularly pigs fed on swill from questionable sources, might have been kept in conditions (how can we put it?) far from ideal. The agencies supposed to monitor animal welfare, their ranks currently depleted, might have some explaining to do. But in the wider context, this disease outbreak is certain to stimulate a serious debate about the kind of farming we want on the countryside we apparently hold so dear. Labour has been plagued by protesting farmers who seemed strangely absent during the final years of the last administration. On the back of the clash over hunting, this government has been blamed for so many rural ills that you would think no farms went bankrupt, village schools, bus services or post offices closed - and, most importantly, no council houses were given away at rock bottom prices in areas desperately short of low cost homes - under John Major or Margaret Thatcher. In truth the rapid growth of out of town superstores in the 80s and 90s, courtesy of a free-market planning regime, did more to damage country high streets and undermine village shops than any high-handed action by Tony Blair. Farmers, sure, have had a rough time with collapsing incomes on the back of the BSE crisis, the big supermarket chains squeezing margins, and now foot and mouth. What the industry rarely tells you, however, is that this recession followed the bonanza years of the mid-90s when takings were at a near-record high, ranking alongside the early 70s when Britain joined the then Common Market and an over-generous subsidy regime kicked in. From this high, the much-quoted 70% fall in farming incomes since the mid-90s (the reason for Tony Blair's largesse a year ago) seems less severe. Most analysts seem to agree that agriculture's overwhelming problem has not been the BSE crisis (largely paid for by the taxpayer), or greedy superstores, but the strength of the pound against the euro which has undermined exports and - more importantly - effectively reduced the EU subsidy, which is set in euros; when the pound was weak in the early to mid-90s, these subsidies - and consequently farming incomes - soared. None of this, of course, helps farming out of its present plight; since the mid-90s alone, about 20,000 farmers have left the land, bringing their numbers to about 353,000. We can be sure that, in the next year or so, many more will disappear - to do what? Well, maybe diversify, with more cash from a much despised common agricultural policy being diverted into the wider rural economy - and the real world. Fifteen months' ago, the Cabinet Office produced a lengthy report urging the government to get real and sweep away a price support framework developed after the last war which had little relevance to the new century. After the present turmoil, a radical government might finally address that last bastion of statism which has somehow remained aloof from the realities of the market place. By then, however, a lot more government cash will have flowed from Whitehall to bail out the victims of this latest crisis. peter.hetherington@theguardian.com What's going on?

The leaders of business organisations are coming together in a joint assault on the government before the election: the CBI and Institute of Directors are joining the Chambers of Commerce annual conference next week, addressed by William Hague. These are threatening battalions, as frightening to the government as the unions once were - and every bit as over-mighty in their pretensions to power. If Labour once cowered before union barons, now they blench when business bellows.</p> <p>Yesterday the Institute for Public Policy Research published some damning research, commissioned by the employment department, showing how low-paid workers are being denied new rights the government has introduced. Many are forced to sign a \"voluntary\" waiver from the 48-hour maximum working time law as a condition of employment. Britain was the only country to insist on a loophole making the 48-hour rule voluntary: the idea was that high-powered people should work as long as they liked. But as many predicted at the time, the reality is that the low-paid are now forced to work the longest hours in Europe. The survey found serious violations of new rights to sick pay and holidays: some knew their rights but dared not demand them. It proved beyond doubt the need for an enforcement agency which workers can call in when their rights were denied.</p> <p>The IPPR - the think tank created within New Labour - has been laying out a far more radical agenda than the government currently looks inclined to adopt. But Labour should be considering it carefully - in particular, their ideas on work. Here is fertile territory for a profound policy difference with the Tories. Hague and Portillo may promise to match all Labour's spending plans, but they carve their own niche in cutting red tape and regulation. Here is a chance for Labour to take the \"red tape\" and wrap it round the Tories' necks. (It is unfortunate that Labour has so often itself played the \"red tape\" card in Europe, trying to woo the business lobby by resisting quite reasonable EU proposals.)</p> <p>The CBI's \"red tape challenge\" and the Chambers of Commerce \"burdens barometer\" campaigns all follow identical themes. The CBI claim \u00a312.3bn extra is paid out by industry for Labour's new employment rights. (This turns out to be notional, and not an annual sum but an arbitrary three years' worth rolled up together). They list billions they say the working time regulations cost - that is the 48-hour week, and four weeks' holiday for the first time given as a right to every worker, with pro-rata holiday rights for every part-timer too. They add in the minimum wage and other \"burdens\" to create a portrait of a country weighed down by socialism.</p> <p>There is no truth in any of this. The OECD - conservative economists - finds Britain has the least market regulation, the lowest corporation tax (lower than any time in its history), and the lowest employment costs - not just lower than the rest of Europe - but, when everything is added in (including US employers' health insurance), lower than the US too. Social insurance and labour taxes average 24% in Europe, 21% in the US and only 13% in Britain.</p> <p>And it feels like it in this under-taxed and over-worked island. Yesterday's Warwick University research showed how British workers' stress levels had risen and job satisfaction plummeted in the last decade. The IPPR's focus groups found a weary acceptance of bad working conditions among middle and lower-level workers, little expectation of anything much better. Adair Turner, previous head of the CBI, writing in the Financial Times this week, praises a high productivity and success in European countries unaffected by their high taxes and tough employment regulation. \"The Dutch economy has performed better than the US over the past 10 years in spite of regulatory and tax burdens that are anathema to a simplistic ultra-liberal creed.\" Britons, he finds, work 25% hours longer than workers in Europe and the US.</p> <p>So in the manifesto the government should rebut all this \"red tape\" talk. The bosses' red tape is most people's decent pay and conditions. It is time for a great leap forward in the way Labour talks about work and people's aspirations. Employment minister Tessa Jowell was (without firm commitments) reaching out in that direction in a speech to the IPPR yesterday. \"Quality of work and equality of opportunity are the important challenges for the next stage. Quality of work is about employees - whatever their income - achieving four key factors: a feeling they are in control, employment rights, training and development and work-life balance.\" Better work, better conditions and an upward ladder for all, not just any old job, but a better job. Will employers be forced to deliver evidence of equal pay and non-age discrimination policies? John Monks at the TUC waits to see if Britain will fight in the EU against a right for employees to be consulted before mergers and closures affecting their lives. The IPPR points out that Gordon Brown's full employment is unachievable without something he has always refused - job-creation in the worst areas - gardeners, caretakers, bus-conductors - doing useful work that improves neighbourhoods.</p> <p>Hard tests lie ahead. There is a fierce battle going on for the right for new mothers to return to work as part-timers. If even this minimal demand is thrown out, then Labour will have missed a chance to enthuse voters with a new political agenda.</p> <p>The big idea is to reconnect politics with what really matters in people's lives - quality of life, happiness, family, freedom and control over their time. Ask people what matters most to their lives, and often it is the chance to take half a day off work for something special, control over their time without feeling chained to a desk or bench. It might be the right to start work later or leave work earlier. It might be a right for all to work part-time if they wanted to train for a better job, spend more time with children, or pursue some richer aspect of their lives. This would be subject to feasibility - but the onus would be on the employer to prove why it couldn't be done. It is quite remarkable how resistant virtually all employers are to job-sharing, even though research shows that two part-timers work harder and better. Many employees could not afford to work less, but knowing they could vary the pace of their work would give them a new control over their lives. In this time of plenty, giving people back their time is easily affordable.

But he lost his last argument too, when MPs approved the introduction of a secret ballot by the narrow margin of two votes.</p> <p>The current procedure - in use for hundreds of years - led to what were widely condemned as shambolic proceedings when it took seven hours for MPs to elect Michael Martin to replace Betty Boothroyd last October. Mr Benn, Labour MP for Chesterfield, led the attack on the system which provoked an all-party inquiry and the recommended changes, including a secret ballot, which were approved yesterday.</p> <p>Under the new system, candidates will need the support of 12 candidates - three from other parties - to avoid the charge of party prejudice. The successful candidate will have to get more than half the vote: if that does not happen on the first ballot, the procedure will be repeated the next day.</p> <p>The idea of a secret ballot - a breach of the tradition of open, recorded votes - was introduced in an attempt to ensure the Speaker's independence. Both government and opposition whips notoriously try to fix the election. It will also mean that the Speaker will not know who did not support them.</p> <p>The Speaker is regarded as guarantor of the rights of backbench MPs.

      "bodyText": "Veteran leftwinger Tony Benn won half of probably his final parliamentary battle last night when MPs voted to reform the way the Speaker of the Commons is elected. But he lost his last argument too, when MPs approved the introduction of a secret ballot by the narrow margin of two votes. The current procedure - in use for hundreds of years - led to what were widely condemned as shambolic proceedings when it took seven hours for MPs to elect Michael Martin to replace Betty Boothroyd last October. Mr Benn, Labour MP for Chesterfield, led the attack on the system which provoked an all-party inquiry and the recommended changes, including a secret ballot, which were approved yesterday. Under the new system, candidates will need the support of 12 candidates - three from other parties - to avoid the charge of party prejudice. The successful candidate will have to get more than half the vote: if that does not happen on the first ballot, the procedure will be repeated the next day. The idea of a secret ballot - a breach of the tradition of open, recorded votes - was introduced in an attempt to ensure the Speaker's independence. Both government and opposition whips notoriously try to fix the election. It will also mean that the Speaker will not know who did not support them. The Speaker is regarded as guarantor of the rights of backbench MPs. Betty Boothroyd let it be known that she resigned from the job early to make sure her successor was elected by MPs with some experience of the Commons rather than potentially more impressionable members of a post-election house. Mr Benn, who has spent years in opposition establishing himself as the champion of parliament against the executive, chose yesterday's debate on the changes to make what will almost certainly be his last speech before he retires at the forthcoming election. \"The role of the Speaker today is that you are protecting us from the triple powers of Buckingham Palace, Millbank Tower and Central Office which in combination represent a serious challenge to our role,\" he said, taking a final swipe at the party headquarters he sees as a serious threat to democracy.

His critics, who these days outnumber his supporters by a large margin, say he should have been sent off already.

The ECB's permanent problem is marrying the monetary needs of Germany - for which recent signs of decline in money supply are bad news - with those of France, Spain and the Netherlands where expansion is still on course. Those three account for 36% of euroland's GDP compared with Germany's 32%. Meanwhile Finland, Greece and the Irish Republic are growing by 4% to 8%. How far the bank should bother with minnows which could benefit from monetary tightening is another question to darken the Frankfurt skies. A rate cut of 0.25% off the main ECB rate of 4.75% is being tipped for the bank's April meeting. If it moves when it meets at the end of next week, Mr Duisenberg's recent assurances that euroland would be largely immune from American recession would look hollow and his credibility further diminish.</p> <p>The other people who hold Europe's economic future in their hands are the policy makers now assembled in Stockholm. In Lisbon a year ago Tony Blair, aided by his pal Jose-Maria Aznar of Spain (a friendship that stops at Gibraltar, however) set out a neo-liberal vision for making the EU \"the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010\". Europe would prosper if government got off people's backs, labour and capital markets freed and a concerted move made towards the IT-based new economy. The Centre for European Reform has just published its (Britocentric) score card on what has happened since.* The European commission gets good marks for pushing the agenda - Romano Prodi's enthusiasm absolves Mr Blair from the charge that is all an Anglo-American plot. Germany has liberalised telecoms and plugged away at research. (The Germans invented the MP3 music transfer technology but though they spend longest online in hours per week of all the EU countries and have an impressive ISDN network, by general consent they lack techno-zest.)</p> <p>But the Germans have joined with the French to block de-regulation of energy and France has, by this account, stuck in the statist mud. Never mind that the French taxpayer subsidises UK electricity consumption...</p> <p>Lionel Jospin notes that the Lisbon protocol also mentioned \"social cohesion\". He would not have to search too hard (power cuts in California, British Telecom's crisis) to find examples of the shortcomings of deregulation and private enterprise, either. Economic theory as under stood by Mr Blair has no room for the German sense that banking arrangements are part of an integrated national culture - Germany has been standing out against the recommendations of the Lamfalussy committee in favour of lighter and Europe-wide financial services regulation.</p> <p>If the EU agreed a new liberalisation package in Stockholm that would not of itself impede what has started to look like euroland's inevitable slide down the growth curve. Which leaves Labour with a political problem, in addition to the grief it would experience if the UK economy lost track. Joining the blossoming eurozone while the Americans were in the doldrums would be a lot easier than major currency adjustment at a time of gloom all round.</p> <p>*Edward Bannerman, The Lisbon Scorecard, <a href=\"http://www.cer.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.cer.org.uk</a><br><br><a href=\"mailto:david.walker@theguardian.com\">david.walker@theguardian.com</a></p>",

The other people who hold Europe's economic future in their hands are the policy makers now assembled in Stockholm. In Lisbon a year ago Tony Blair, aided by his pal Jose-Maria Aznar of Spain (a friendship that stops at Gibraltar, however) set out a neo-liberal vision for making the EU \"the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010\". Europe would prosper if government got off people's backs, labour and capital markets freed and a concerted move made towards the IT-based new economy. The Centre for European Reform has just published its (Britocentric) score card on what has happened since.* The European commission gets good marks for pushing the agenda - Romano Prodi's enthusiasm absolves Mr Blair from the charge that is all an Anglo-American plot. Germany has liberalised telecoms and plugged away at research. (The Germans invented the MP3 music transfer technology but though they spend longest online in hours per week of all the EU countries and have an impressive ISDN network, by general consent they lack techno-zest.) But the Germans have joined with the French to block de-regulation of energy and France has, by this account, stuck in the statist mud. Never mind that the French taxpayer subsidises UK electricity consumption... Lionel Jospin notes that the Lisbon protocol also mentioned \"social cohesion\". He would not have to search too hard (power cuts in California, British Telecom's crisis) to find examples of the shortcomings of deregulation and private enterprise, either. Economic theory as under stood by Mr Blair has no room for the German sense that banking arrangements are part of an integrated national culture - Germany has been standing out against the recommendations of the Lamfalussy committee in favour of lighter and Europe-wide financial services regulation. If the EU agreed a new liberalisation package in Stockholm that would not of itself impede what has started to look like euroland's inevitable slide down the growth curve. Which leaves Labour with a political problem, in addition to the grief it would experience if the UK economy lost track. Joining the blossoming eurozone while the Americans were in the doldrums would be a lot easier than major currency adjustment at a time of gloom all round. *Edward Bannerman, The Lisbon Scorecard, www.cer.org.uk david.walker@theguardian.com",

Cumbria is going to be wiped out. Mr Blair doesn't care tuppence about the north of England,\" he said. \"He should have been here three weeks ago. He didn't even look at us. He hasn't even got the guts to tell us it's out of control. Get yourself out on to the farms, Mr Blair, it's carnage.\" Cumbria has one third of the country's foot and mouth cases. The number of confirmed cases in the county yesterday rose to 162. Farming is losing \u00a35m a week. At least 50 people a day lose their jobs in the tourist industry as knock-on effect. Tens of thousands of diseased cattle are awaiting slaughter. Tens of thousands of carcasses are lying rotting out side farmers' kitchens. Marian Burnip, a publican from Keswick, stood holding a banner saying \"Cumbria in crisis\". Her pub had lost \u00a31,500 revenue this week. \"I have just driven up the M6 past four or five burning pyres. Blair's visit is too late,\" she said. Philip Chappelhow, who is standing as a Conservative councillor in the May 3 local elections, held a banner asking Mr Blair to postpone the elections. \"He has just come up here for a photocall. We have been ignored,\" he said. Inside the pub, Peter Allen of the National Farmers' Union, who met Mr Blair, said: \"I wish we could have had this meeting two weeks ago. We have been pushing for it for two weeks.\" Nick Utting, from the NFU, said the meeting was productive and farmers felt they had impressed upon Mr Blair the serious organisational and bureaucratic \"sticking points\" that had allowed the disease to get out of control. Eric Matlew, the local Labour MP, who earlier this week said the government had been clueless as to the reality of the north, maintained that there would have to be a public inquiry into the handling of the crisis. After the meeting, the prime minister said the government would do anything that was necessary to overcome the disease. Mr Blair said red tape would be removed and every resource would be made available. \"Whatever practical resources in the area to get the thing and get it done properly we will do.\" He said it was a \"terrible situation for the farming community and the tourist industry\". Responding to criticism that the slaughtering was not happening fast enough, he said: \"Speed is of the essence.\" He added: \"I understand all the criticisms, I simply say there was a fear a week ago that we were over-reacting with the slaughter policy. But now I would think people would say 'We want that policy carried out and carried out quickly'.\" He said the agriculture minister, Nick Brown, had done \"a superb job in extremely difficult circumstances\". Commenting on the reason for the Carlisle visit, a Downing Street spokesman said: \"Essentially, Mr Blair wants to hear from the people at the sharp end how the logistical operation in particular is going.

But the statement seems only to have pulled the shares back marginally, after a fall yesterday of 16%.

      "byline": "Martin Kettle",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Late yesterday afternoon I realised, with a not unpleasant shock, that I had not read about Bill Clinton for days. Well, maybe that is not exactly right. I know he has been in Holland or somewhere, giving a lecture, but the point still stands.</p> <p>Right now, he is marginal. All of a sudden it seems to be over.</p> <p>He has been off the screen, out of the headlines, not even in my mind, for almost a week now. I feel a bit like I felt when I gave up smoking many years ago. Hey, I can do without it. Well, maybe.</p> <p>But now I am nagged by another question. Is the feeling the same for the Democratic party? Now that Clinton is gone - at least for a while - does his party feel bereaved or liberated? Answer: probably a bit of both.</p> <p>Have they seriously begun to contemplate life after Clinton? Answer: not systematically, but there are signs that a kind of process is beginning.</p> <p>Time is cruel to ex-leaders. They slip - or in Clinton's case, they crash and blunder - off the stage and then, quite without one noticing, they become forgotten. Today, and not before time, Clinton is in the past.</p> <p>It is George Bush who commands the airwaves and the daily attention of the media today, as Clinton did for so long. If the Democrats have a figurehead today, it is not Clinton and it certainly is not Al Gore, who has disappeared with far greater grace than his former boss.</p> <p>As a result, right now, the effective leader of the party is Tom Daschle. If you want a sign that things are moving on, then this week's appearance of an article in the New Republic magazine putting the case for Daschle as the Democratic nominee against Bush in 2004 was as good as any.</p> <p>Two months ago, it was hard to believe that anyone outside the Daschle household had even given a passing thought to the possibility of President Daschle. Now the quietly spoken Democratic senate leader from South Dakota - a state Bush carried, by the way - is being described in print as his party's \"last, best hope\".</p> <p>Well, perhaps he is and perhaps he isn't. If you are looking for a Democratic dark horse in the 2004 stakes, I would be inclined to offer John Edwards of North Carolina myself. But what is important at this stage is that people are beginning to think about things like this.</p> <p>Nevertheless, before the Democrats can choose a nominee, they need to do a bit more work on deciding what kind of party they are in the post-Clinton era.</p> <p>Clinton's one-time friend Robert Reich, his first-term labour secretary, penned a devastating little op-ed piece on this subject in the Washington Post earlier this month. Taking his theme from the Monty Python \"dead parrot\" sketch, Reich took over the John Cleese role in the sketch and pronounced: \"This political party - the Democratic party - it's dead.\"</p> <p>Just consider the past eight years, Reich argued. The Democrats have lost the presidency, lost both houses of Congress, lost almost all their state legislative majorities, and lost most governorships. Most judges on the supreme court have been appointed by Republicans and there are clearly more to come.</p> <p>The party, like the parrot, has been nailed on its limited perch, wrote Reich. \"Clinton is utterly disgraced. Gore ran a lousy campaign\". Instead, why doesn't the party insist that the budget surplus is spent on health care - and child care - and new schools? Why doesn't it challenge the $300bn that the US spends on the military each year? Why does it play dead on the environment?</p> <p>Answer, says Reich, because it is dead.</p> <p>That may seem excessive.

      "bodyText": "Late yesterday afternoon I realised, with a not unpleasant shock, that I had not read about Bill Clinton for days. Well, maybe that is not exactly right. I know he has been in Holland or somewhere, giving a lecture, but the point still stands. Right now, he is marginal. All of a sudden it seems to be over. He has been off the screen, out of the headlines, not even in my mind, for almost a week now. I feel a bit like I felt when I gave up smoking many years ago. Hey, I can do without it. Well, maybe. But now I am nagged by another question. Is the feeling the same for the Democratic party? Now that Clinton is gone - at least for a while - does his party feel bereaved or liberated? Answer: probably a bit of both. Have they seriously begun to contemplate life after Clinton? Answer: not systematically, but there are signs that a kind of process is beginning. Time is cruel to ex-leaders. They slip - or in Clinton's case, they crash and blunder - off the stage and then, quite without one noticing, they become forgotten. Today, and not before time, Clinton is in the past. It is George Bush who commands the airwaves and the daily attention of the media today, as Clinton did for so long. If the Democrats have a figurehead today, it is not Clinton and it certainly is not Al Gore, who has disappeared with far greater grace than his former boss. As a result, right now, the effective leader of the party is Tom Daschle. If you want a sign that things are moving on, then this week's appearance of an article in the New Republic magazine putting the case for Daschle as the Democratic nominee against Bush in 2004 was as good as any. Two months ago, it was hard to believe that anyone outside the Daschle household had even given a passing thought to the possibility of President Daschle. Now the quietly spoken Democratic senate leader from South Dakota - a state Bush carried, by the way - is being described in print as his party's \"last, best hope\". Well, perhaps he is and perhaps he isn't. If you are looking for a Democratic dark horse in the 2004 stakes, I would be inclined to offer John Edwards of North Carolina myself. But what is important at this stage is that people are beginning to think about things like this. Nevertheless, before the Democrats can choose a nominee, they need to do a bit more work on deciding what kind of party they are in the post-Clinton era. Clinton's one-time friend Robert Reich, his first-term labour secretary, penned a devastating little op-ed piece on this subject in the Washington Post earlier this month. Taking his theme from the Monty Python \"dead parrot\" sketch, Reich took over the John Cleese role in the sketch and pronounced: \"This political party - the Democratic party - it's dead.\" Just consider the past eight years, Reich argued. The Democrats have lost the presidency, lost both houses of Congress, lost almost all their state legislative majorities, and lost most governorships. Most judges on the supreme court have been appointed by Republicans and there are clearly more to come. The party, like the parrot, has been nailed on its limited perch, wrote Reich. \"Clinton is utterly disgraced. Gore ran a lousy campaign\". Instead, why doesn't the party insist that the budget surplus is spent on health care - and child care - and new schools? Why doesn't it challenge the $300bn that the US spends on the military each year? Why does it play dead on the environment? Answer, says Reich, because it is dead. That may seem excessive. This is, after all, the party whose presidential candidate won some 50m votes, which holds half the seats in the senate and which, if the traditional midterm patterns repeat themselves, could win the house of representatives in 2002. Moreover, it is a party which mobilised its core voters more successfully than many thought possible last November. It is also a party which, in the eyes of at least some of its centrist supporters, for whom Reich reserved some of his cruelest barbs, has successfully reinvented itself as a potential majority party rather than as a collection of minorities that can never quite oust the Republicans. This is a huge subject, the stuff of many columns. But the point that needs to be made right now is that Reich speaks for more people at the moment than he would have done four years ago. It is a case that demands to be answered seriously, as the Ralph Nader campaign showed. The Democrats have lost more than they have gained at the end of the Clinton years, and they need to rally behind something much greater than the ability to raise as much soft money as their rivals. A certain humility - and not just about Clinton's personal failings - is in order from the centrists who led for so long. Right now, the Democratic party needs a cause more than it needs a leader.

The compromise has the backing of senior Labour ministers on both sides of the \"fair votes\" argument, as well as Kennedy loyalists. Some opponents of reform claimed that further delay will help them. A despondent Charter 88 called it a setback. After weeks of speculation that Labour would ditch its half-hearted commitment to a referendum on proportional representation (PR) it emerged last night that Mr Blair and the Liberal Democrat leader met on Tuesday and found a face-saving formula that will encourage tactical anti-Tory voting on polling day. As a result, Labour's manifesto will be far less hostile than many MPs expected to the \"AV-Plus\" version of PR suggested by Lord Jenkins in his 1998 royal commission report - shelved in the face of active pressure on Mr Blair by the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, the chancellor, Gordon Brown, and a majority of Labour MPs and activists. Noting that the government has \"introduced major innovations in electoral systems used in the UK, for the Scottish and European parliaments and Welsh and London assemblies\", the draft formula for Labour's manifesto commitment goes on to promise to \"review the experience of the new systems and the Jenkins report to assess whether changes may be made to the electoral system for the House of Commons\". Though it will also confirm that the referendum which Mr Blair promised Paddy Ashdown in 1997 \"remains the right way to agree any change at Westminster\" the imposition of a review is a vehicle for further delay in exactly the same way that Mr Brown's \"five economic tests\" have delayed the referendum on whether to join the euro.

Barry's had a heart attack,\" he shrieked. \"You'd better come and stay with me,\" he added once Barry had got the all-clear from the hospital. \"Who are you?\" asked Oliver when he went to Barry's flat to get his clothes. \"I'm Carla.\" Oliver felt a lump in his trousers. \"Er... would you like to go out with me?\" \"Sure. Why not?\" \"You've fallen for Carla, haven't you?\" laughed Barry. \"She's a call-girl. Too expensive for you.\" \"Wah, wah,\" wailed Oliver. \"Why am I such a wetty that I misread every social situation?\" The phone rang. \"I've lost my weekly column,\" Barry said quietly. \"Maybe it's time I stopped drinking heavily and started treating people a little better.\" \"You can have the house, Barry,\" said Oliver. \"I'm going to live in your flat.\" Sophie took Oliver under her wing and introduced him to her expensive friends. Within days he had become an osteopath to many and a shag to some. Suddenly he was brimming with self-confidence. Life was good. And if you really are pressed: The digested read, digested: Oliver and Barry plod their way through 184 pages of mind-numbing self-discovery",

      "body": "<p>Ismail Merchant has a winning smile that he can turn on like a light bulb - a feature that came in very handy when he was directing the new Merchant-Ivory production of VS Naipaul's novel, The Mystic Masseur. Because, having decided to shoot the film in Naipaul's native Trinidad, Merchant-Ivory Productions couldn't possibly have chosen a worse time to arrive. </p> <p>The cast and crew - travelling from New York, London and Bombay - landed three months ago, jetlagged, in the middle of the furore surrounding Trinidad and Tobago's general election. The country's predominantly Indian-Trinidadian party, the United National Congress, had just scraped to a contentious election victory. Allegations of large-scale gerrymandering and fraud filled the newspapers, while the prime minister, Basdeo Panday, and President Robinson were engaged in a constitutional mud-slinging contest. </p> <p>Robinson had refused to sign documents allowing Panday to appoint seven ministers who lost their seats in the election. Panday had been presented with a libel suit for calling someone a \"pseudo racist\", and added further fuel to the fire by claiming that the islands were being threatened by an impending coup. </p> <p>It was a warning that many took seriously. In 1990, after all, there had been a real coup attempt, in which several people were killed near the parliament building. However, those responsible for that particular drama now said they knew nothing about this latest scare. Nor had the chief of defence staff heard any whisper of danger. Perhaps the prime minister, having only narrowly won the election, wanted to create a little tension so that he could be seen as a safe pair of hands. </p> <p>Another possible explanation was simple scaremongering - Panday's way of making the president see things his way over the constitutional impasse. The two are old sparring partners and they don't call Panday, former union leader and actor of no mean repute, the \"Silver Fox\" for nothing. He insisted that Robinson - a physically sick man - was no longer fit to hold office. The president, in return, described the prime minister's rule as a \"creeping dictatorship\". </p> <p>At first, none of this swordplay perturbed the film's producers. They assumed, quite reasonably, that it was none of their affair. \"You've got to be a supreme optimist in this business or you never get anywhere,\" said Merchant, smiling. \"Maybe the government, or someone, will be interested in investing in the film.\" With that in mind, he instructed his young nephew - Nayeem Hafizka, who was leading the production team - to seek out some useful contacts. </p> <p>Nayeem is his uncle's clone: same charming smile, same soft manner of speaking, same tenacious approach to wheeling and dealing until he gets a discount on everything - from meals in restaurants to rented property for himself, the cast and crew. And he is very good at his job. Before long, the prime minister himself had handed over his mobile phone number. And the cameras had barely started rolling on the island's lush north-western peninsular when a local industrialist announced that he would be putting in half a million US dollars in return for a credit as executive producer. </p> <p>However, Nayeem's smooth approach did not wash with BWIA, the national airline. The press officer was adamant: \"We can't even consider giving discounts to film people.\" From Nayeem's point of view, though, it was worth a try: \"It's very important to keep a close watch on the budget all the time.\" </p> <p>Indeed, Merchant-Ivory had come to the tiny Caribbean state with a tight budget, believing that, as in Bollywood, they would be able shoot the movie for under $3m - a sum that would hardly have paid the food bill on some of their more lavish productions. Here, chicken and rice were the order of the day, with a few local vegetables and a slab of currant cake for dessert (although on the day Basdeo Panday took a break from his various crises to pop in for lunch on the set, they had shrimp). </p> <p>Despite Nayeem's efforts, the purse-strings were at times pulled a little too tight. Om Puri, star of East Is East and City of Joy, who plays the scheming village storekeeper Ramlogan in the film, is prone to backache. After a few days and nights, he was in need of rest, but all he could find to to lie down on were some planks of wood. \"There were only six chairs between 60 people,\" he said. \"Not even a nurse or doctor handy on the set - which is usually the case.\" He spent much of his first day off from filming receving much-needed treatment from a Trinidadian masseuse. </p> <p>Actor James Fox, who flew 4,000 miles from London on a Saturday to play a spiritual recluse in a single scene, found himself filming the next morning and flying back to England the following Tuesday. Merchant wasn't about to subsidise a leisurely break on a palm-fringed beach. \"He really is quite mean,\" said Fox. </p> <p>But it took just one frenetic day to vindicate Merchant's frugality. While filming in the island's old capital, Port-of-Spain, the crew cordoned off a street to traffic. They had chosen as their location an old printing works with a hand press - just the sort of place used in the novel by its protagonist, Ganesh Ramsumair, mystic healer and aspiring writer of books (played by Aasif Mandvi). </p> <p>Suddenly, as they were preparing for the first take, a commotion broke out in the street. A family sitting outside their house refused to budge out of shot until they been properly compensated. \"We want 1,500 [Trinidadian] dollars [about \u00a3150] ... and put it in writing,\" they said. Nayeem and Ismail turned on the smiles. No go; the locals claimed that no one had warned them that the street would be closed for two days. The police were called. Still no go. </p> <p>Sensing an opportunity, a barber and a barkeeper decided to join in. Both complained that they would lose so much trade, they would not be able to pay the rent at the end of the week. The family, meanwhile, who were now squatting on the pavement, were opening up to the idea of negotiation. If three of them were taken on as extras, they said, they might reconsider. For the first time that day, Nayeem and Ismail lost their smiles, and capitulated. Finally, filming got under way. </p> <p>Opportunism was not the only problem facing the crew. Naipaul's story - that of a simple faith-healer who becomes a successful diplomat - describes an honest man's struggle against ignorance, greed and big-city corruption in the 1950s, a time when Trinidad was struggling for independence. Accordingly, some of the period props proved very hard to track down. Top of the wanted list were a 1937 Vauxhall and a 1952 Rolls-Royce; then there were the pre-war bicycles and all the stock for the specially built village store and various wooden houses. As the film-makers soon realised, Trinidad has little in the way of film infrastructure; no storehouse of historic treasures saved for posterity. Long before the first roll of film was completed, the two Englishwomen responsible for set design and dressing were exhausted. Fortunately, a Trinidadian woman with a lot of contacts and energy stepped into the breach and worked miracles. </p> <p>One local producer, who had spent weeks hunting for suitable locations, quit the film in exasperation over the terms of her contract. So much was expected of her so quickly, and for so little reward, she said, that she felt she was being exploited. </p> <p>A local film director, Tony Maharaj, brought in as associate producer to help Merchant \"fix things\", said: \"It's been a nightmare of leaving things until the last minute. When we needed a rain scene, they only asked for the fire brigade the night before filming.\" </p> <p>The Mystic Masseur was Merchant's fourth film as director - James Ivory has taken the helm on most of their previous collaborations - but it was his first film in Trinidad, and he was having to learn the ways of the island by trial and error. He arrived in the country with the impression that the Pulitzer prize-winning Naipaul was a local hero, and that the locals would be only too happy to cooperate. But it was not to be so. It soon emerged that the relationship between the author and his countrymen is something of a love-hate affair: Naipaul's fiction captures every twist and turn in the Trinidadian psyche, and many do not appreciate his candour. </p> <p>Some locals, however, were more sympathetic, and keen to play some small part in the making of the movie. Although as the producers admit, they might not have been quite so keen if they had known what they were letting themselves in for. </p> <p> When it came to the filming of the Governor's Ball scene, for example, 60 or so Trinidadians were hired as extras. They arrived on the Saturday evening full of enthusiasm, chattering excitedly as they were dressed for the shoot. Soon afterwards, however, they discovered what being an extra really entails: endless hours of waiting around for something to happen. </p> <p>The first attempts at filming were catastrophic. Someone had forgotten to hire the string quartet; the lighting was not quite right; the choreography wasn't coming together. At 2am they abandoned the set, and told everyone to come back on Sunday afternoon. </p> <p>The long-suffering extras were paid just 100 Trinidadian dollars a day [just under \u00a310] for their pains. Fortunately, the majority were not in it for the money. Most were thrilled simply to be involved in the film - especially in such a grand scene as the governor's dinner, filmed in prime minister Panday's newly refurbished offices. Some of those at the colonial bash, seated at the long dinner table, resplendent with cut glass and silver, came from old Trinidad plantation families whose grandparents would have attended such affairs in the past. Being from the country, like the film's hero Ganesh, they didn't have a clue about codes of dress or the parade of wine glasses and cutlery glinting at them from the snow-white linen. </p> <p>However, the novelty and grandeur of the occasion had long worn off by the time filming ended. Further complications meant that the scene was finally wrapped at 5am - only an hour before the prime minister wanted his office back. Ivory, who had flown in from New York to escape the cold and cast a back-seat eye over the production, laconically referred to the night-long filming ordeal as all part of \"the degradation of being an extra\". </p> <p>In spite of such stressful days, all concerned are agreed that the experience of filming The Mystic Masseur has ultimately been a useful one - as much for Trinidad as for the Merchant-Ivory team. The government's tourist office, for example, is hoping to leave the little village of Mount Pleasant, created by the film-makers in Chaguaramas, just as it is, as part of a heritage site.</p>",

      "body": "<p>I am writing in response to your excellent series on the state of our public sector (The Common Good, March 20 and 21). I am a staff nurse at the children's hospital here in Bristol and much of the debate and discussion gave me new insight into my position and of those unsung heroes up and down the country. </p> <p>It dismays me to read that the public (our clients) demand higher standards, shorter waiting lists and cleaner hospitals, and at the same time agreeing that we should be better paid, but refusing to pay for it from higher taxes. (Remember I am a tax-payer too.) Society today is self-centred and losing its altruism in return for money, mobile phones, more foreign holidays etc. In the recent referendum held by Bristol council asking us to decide on the level of council tax, a majority voted for a freeze in bills for the third year in a row - despite the council's stark outline of the consequences of a freeze for local schools (the sacking of teachers, fewer classes, fewer books). </p> <p>People must accept responsibility for the society we live in, rather than the self-centred attitude that has become the accepted norm. Maybe your articles will open people's eyes to the state of our nation, which worships footballers, yet has no respect for those caring for their own elders. <br><strong>Sebastian deGange</strong><br>Bristol </p> <p>I longed to believe Tony Blair's commitment to the provision of \"good public services\" (March 20). However, in Oxfordshire, \"we've made a good start\" is so demonstrably inaccurate. The city and county can hardly be called a deprived area, yet such is the state of our public services that accident victims are waiting 10 hours for \"emergency treatment\" in the casualty department of John Radcliffe hospital.

      "bodyText": "I am writing in response to your excellent series on the state of our public sector (The Common Good, March 20 and 21). I am a staff nurse at the children's hospital here in Bristol and much of the debate and discussion gave me new insight into my position and of those unsung heroes up and down the country. It dismays me to read that the public (our clients) demand higher standards, shorter waiting lists and cleaner hospitals, and at the same time agreeing that we should be better paid, but refusing to pay for it from higher taxes. (Remember I am a tax-payer too.) Society today is self-centred and losing its altruism in return for money, mobile phones, more foreign holidays etc. In the recent referendum held by Bristol council asking us to decide on the level of council tax, a majority voted for a freeze in bills for the third year in a row - despite the council's stark outline of the consequences of a freeze for local schools (the sacking of teachers, fewer classes, fewer books). People must accept responsibility for the society we live in, rather than the self-centred attitude that has become the accepted norm. Maybe your articles will open people's eyes to the state of our nation, which worships footballers, yet has no respect for those caring for their own elders. Sebastian deGange Bristol I longed to believe Tony Blair's commitment to the provision of \"good public services\" (March 20). However, in Oxfordshire, \"we've made a good start\" is so demonstrably inaccurate. The city and county can hardly be called a deprived area, yet such is the state of our public services that accident victims are waiting 10 hours for \"emergency treatment\" in the casualty department of John Radcliffe hospital. In the county council, we are upwards of 20 workers short in our children and families section, and in Oxford city, schools are covering for two dozen seemingly unfillable teacher vacancies. Further, we have had to reduce the number of children taken into care, not because families in Oxfordshire are treating their children better, but because we haven't the money to provide for them. All this and much more imposes huge strains on staff (and councillors for that matter). Recruitment and retention of staff is increasingly difficult because of the low wages paid to those who serve the public and the high cost of living in this area. The position is further exacerbated by the lack of social housing. The huge sums mentioned in Mr Blair's article are meaningless to the many people working in hospitals, schools and social services in Oxfordshire who are desperate for decent working conditions and affordable accommodation and surroundings for themselves and their families. Cllr Tom Richardson Oxfordshire county council The problem in the public sector is one of money, but also of trust. In the belief that we will do our jobs badly unless we are bullied to do them well, the government has imposed an audit culture which produces so much work of its own that increasingly little time is left to do the job which is being audited. In AuditWorld the only incentives are fear and suspicion, and the effects on motivation are corrosive.

      "bodyText": "Elisabeth Murdoch has unveiled further details of her new production company Shine, including a two-year TV and film output deal with BSkyB worth at least \u00a310m. Ms Murdoch is the company's chairman and chief executive, with Lord Waheed Alli coming on board as executive director, with an equity stake. \"We intend to be the home for the best creative talent in the industry, which we will combine with a strong commercial infrastructure,\" said Ms Murdoch. Shine has four operating divisions, encompassing TV, films, rights management and venture programming, which will act as a broker between TV producers and brand owners looking to develop content. Shine venture programming, which is headed by former managing partner of St Luke's advertising agency David Pemsel, has already signed a deal with IPC Media to develop a daytime TV format. The TV and film production arms will be boosted by the two-year BSkyB output agreement, which is said to have formed part of the deal Ms Murdoch negotiated when she left her job as managing director of Sky Networks in May last year. The BSkyB deal is understood to be worth a minimum of \u00a35m a year. Ms Murdoch has hired Sally Anne Howard, whose production credits include Trisha, This Morning, Vanessa and Jerry Springer, as executive producer of lifestyle. Former BBC controller of documentaries and history Paul Hamann is joining Shine as creative director, factual. Mr Hamann has a remit to develop long running factual series for broadcasters including Sky One and Channel 4, rather than one-off documentaries. Ms Murdoch has already hired Royle Family producer Kenton Allen as creative director, entertainment and comedy. She is also looking to hire a head of drama, or link up with an existing independent drama producer. Other Shine appointments include Andrew Hill as director of planning. Like Mr Pemsel, Mr Hill is joining the firm from St Luke's, where he was communications director. Shine has appointed William Morris to handle the US distribution of its programming and formats.

The capital markets have virtually closed to the sector which borrowed to the hilt to finance the bids for next generation mobile phone licences. </p> <p>The company has not issued its full quota of commercial paper that the facility supports and BT is considering reducing the debt, according to reports. </p> <p>The renegotiation of the loan is likely to lead to BT paying higher terms. At present it is spread between 12 banks which are expected to ask for the risk to be spread further. </p> <p>BT has been caught out by the slide in equity markets which has thrown its plans to reduce debt into disarray.

      "bodyText": "BT shares continued their slide into ignominy yesterday, losing another 5% of their value to close at 469p. The fall came amid reports that the beleaguered company has begun discussing means of refinancing its \u00a318bn syndicated loan. Negotiations with bankers are part of the company's wider attempt to get a handle on its debts which have mounted to \u00a330bn. BT's \u00a318bn loan facility does not mature until August but increasingly difficult borrowing conditions for telecoms companies have prompted the group to begin renegotiating early. The capital markets have virtually closed to the sector which borrowed to the hilt to finance the bids for next generation mobile phone licences. The company has not issued its full quota of commercial paper that the facility supports and BT is considering reducing the debt, according to reports. The renegotiation of the loan is likely to lead to BT paying higher terms. At present it is spread between 12 banks which are expected to ask for the risk to be spread further. BT has been caught out by the slide in equity markets which has thrown its plans to reduce debt into disarray. The company had hoped to seek stock market flotations for up to 25% of BT Wireless and Yell, its directories business. Earlier this week the group called off a meeting with key investors. Directors of the company had hoped to explore the levels of support for alternative options. In return for supporting a massive cash call some investors are calling for the heads of senior BT executives including chief executive Sir Peter Bonfield and chairman Sir Iain Vallance. The meeting was cancelled because of claims that it had descended into a \"media circus\" according to a BT insider.",

      "body": "<p>Capital Radio yesterday became the latest casualty of the downturn in advertising when its shares fell by 24% on a warning that growth in revenues had ground to a halt in the past two months. </p> <p>Unless conditions improve the radio group's full-year profits are likely to be 10% lower than last year, the company said in a statement. </p> <p>Advertising growth across the first half to the end of March will be 2% ahead of last year, compared with a forecast of 4% in December. </p> <p>But Capital chief executive David Mansfield said revenues had worsened during February and March, with growth falling away to nothing. </p> <p>The warning continued a bruising week for Capital which saw its share price hit on Monday by a downgrade from the investment bank UBS Warburg. The price fell 212.5p yesterday to 665p, bringing the total decline since the beginning of the week to almost 37%. The shares are at a two-year low. </p> <p>Evidence of a sharper slowdown in the advertising market than analysts had forecast is now inescapable. </p> <p>RTL, Europe's largest commercial television and radio group, similarly warned earlier this week that full-year earnings would be flat. RTL shares fell a further 9% yesterday in Brussels. </p> <p>The Capital statement dragged other radio stocks down in its wake. GWR fell 16% to 422.5p and Chrysalis dropped 11% to 259p. </p> <p>Mr Mansfield said it was \"very difficult\" to predict what would happen to the advertising market this year.

      "bodyText": "Capital Radio yesterday became the latest casualty of the downturn in advertising when its shares fell by 24% on a warning that growth in revenues had ground to a halt in the past two months. Unless conditions improve the radio group's full-year profits are likely to be 10% lower than last year, the company said in a statement. Advertising growth across the first half to the end of March will be 2% ahead of last year, compared with a forecast of 4% in December. But Capital chief executive David Mansfield said revenues had worsened during February and March, with growth falling away to nothing. The warning continued a bruising week for Capital which saw its share price hit on Monday by a downgrade from the investment bank UBS Warburg. The price fell 212.5p yesterday to 665p, bringing the total decline since the beginning of the week to almost 37%. The shares are at a two-year low. Evidence of a sharper slowdown in the advertising market than analysts had forecast is now inescapable. RTL, Europe's largest commercial television and radio group, similarly warned earlier this week that full-year earnings would be flat. RTL shares fell a further 9% yesterday in Brussels. The Capital statement dragged other radio stocks down in its wake. GWR fell 16% to 422.5p and Chrysalis dropped 11% to 259p. Mr Mansfield said it was \"very difficult\" to predict what would happen to the advertising market this year. He has, he added, lived through these conditions before. \"Advertising is a cyclical business and we will come out the other side. The markets are hugely sensitive at the moment and there's nothing we can do about that. \"We have arguably the best portfolio of analogue radio stations, we are a very focused company with great brands and a strong management team. The growth will come back.\" The group's London stations have suffered most severely after taking a large chunk of the dot.com and telecoms adver tising which accounted for rapid growth last year and has fallen away in 2001. Revenues including acquisitions for the first half are likely to be 8% higher. Analysts have downgraded their full-year profit forecasts from around \u00a340m to a range of \u00a334m-\u00a336m. The UBS Warburg note changed its recommendation from \"reduce\" to \"sell\". The note said Capital's maturing portfolio of assets set the com pany apart from other, younger radio businesses and suggested it no longer warranted a similar valuation. It noted that the uncertainties still surrounding ownership restrictions in Britain and the problems faced by potential international suitors such as RTL meant there was little chance of Capital playing a part in industry consolidation. \"Investors need to differentiate between winners and losers in this sector,\" said Warburg media analyst Simon Mays-Smith. \"Things are tough for Capital.

      "body": "<p><strong> Geoffrey Rush</strong> </p> <p>\u0095 Won best actor for Shine in 1997, nominated best actor this year for Quills </p> <p>Inevitably, I was flying completely blind. But somewhere in the back of my head there was the absurd notion that, should my name be called, I'd know what to do because I've seen people do it from childhood onward. There are those almost mental, Arthur Murray-type dance steps that say: \"Walk up that staircase, go to the middle, turn to face front.\" So somehow, you get to do that. </p> <p>That was the year that independent film was knocking very loudly at the mainstream door. The Elton John Aids benefit bash afterwards was a great place to be because it was in honour of all the independent films. So there was a lot to celebrate. This year, Giorgio Armani has kindly offered to prepare something. </p> <p>It's a huge event, so that's always nerve-wracking, exciting and bewildering. But I have no anticipation about getting it. It's a cliche to say it's an honour to be nominated - and there are 10 or 20 other performances that should have been in there. People will go into an outrage and a tailspin that their favorites aren't. But the nominations are a good cross-section of what's out there in movieland at the moment. If I've learned anything, having been there twice before and presenting one year, it's to have a couple of soft, poached eggs with a bit of toast at about 2pm because you're not going to get anything in your stomach until about 10. </p> <p>That's a practical tip - if anyone ever wants to write the book What to Do on Oscar Morning. </p> <p> <strong> Timothy Everest</strong> </p> <p>\u0095 Tom Cruise's tailor </p> <p>Lauren Scott, who looks after Tom Cruise, was appointed Oscars 2000 style director, vetting the clothes of everyone onstage. She asked me to assist. So a week later I was in LA, heading to the ceremony, but I missed my driver and couldn't get anywhere near the Shrine because of the police and security and the fact that my Access All Areas pass had expired at 1pm. My afternoon and evening passes were in our limo. So I was running down the road in black tie looking for the car, which was stuck in the limo-lock, but each time I got near, it pulled another 20 yards further forward. It was like running for a bus. I eventually jumped in just as it was pulling up to the entrance and almost immediately had to get out the other side, red-faced and sweating. </p> <p>We came out on to the red carpet and I did the whole Ronald Reagan thing, saluting and pointing to strangers in the crowd and waving while they all tried to work out who I was. The red carpet is actually really tatty and should probably have been thrown out years ago. </p> <p>The first thing I noticed in the auditorium was that they have all these lookalike seat-filler stand-ins in case someone gets up to receive an award or have a pee or something. I was sitting behind Angelina Jolie and her brother - and they had a gothic-looking stand-in for her and a peroxided double-pierced-ear stand-in for him. I had to keep running out the back and checking clothes and it was like Gerry Cottle's circus. Everyone has their own caravan and some had filled them with flowers and fruit; others just had gigantic bowls of M&amp;Ms. During the commercial breaks everyone just gets up and starts networking. The front row is where the main action is. Clint Eastwood was chatting to Tom Cruise, and Billy Crystal was trying to calm Jack Nicholson down. He's shouting \"Billy, I love you!\" and turning to Erykah Badu behind and going \"I love your headdress!\" and Billy's saying \"I love you too, Jack, but please sit down 'cos we're coming back live in 10, 9, 8 ...\" </p> <p>It's not really a feverish atmosphere; everyone's trying to be very controlled. It's more like a glammed-up works outing. At the Vanity Fair party after, you have these fans checking people off as they go in the door, shouting \"Val!\" and ticking his name off as he waves and goes in, then \"Jude!\" then \"Ethan!\" then \"Uma!\" It's like trainspotting. They all wind up early and I suppose everyone then goes home and has a cup of cocoa. It was a very surreal experience. </p> <p> <strong> Tom Hanks</strong> </p> <p>\u0095 Won best actor for Philadelphia in 1994 and for Forrest Gump in 1995. Nominated best actor for Big in 1989 and Saving Private Ryan in 1999. Nominated this year for Cast Away </p> <p>My joke the first time I won was that if you're nominated and you don't win, everybody forgets it after a week; if you're nominated and you win, everybody pretty much forgets it after two weeks. I don't think about it any more. We all do it because we love movies and because it's our job and it's also one of the barometers for how you're doing. It's like having a baby. The day you have a baby it's just the greatest thing in the world. Well, the next day you have this baby to take care of and you have the memory of that baby coming out, but other than that, now you're into the nuts and bolts of that one damn thing after another that life seems to be and that's what this is. </p> <p>The day itself is a very personal experience because the family is supercharged, people are stopping by. It's like a wedding. There's a spirit of excitement that lasts about 18 hours and you're exhausted at the end of it. I'm lucky enough to be able to say you're exhausted whether you win or lose. My attention is so splayed in the course of the day that I don't remember what I do from one minute to the next. </p> <p>I don't think it's possible to stick to a prepared script. I always have five things to say and I always screw up one of them, and forget another one completely and then replace the other three with other things that entered my head at the last moment. So, it's not something you can control. It's like suddenly jumping out of an airplane. </p> <p> <strong> Billy Crystal</strong> </p> <p>\u0095 Host in 1990-93, 1997-8, 2000 </p> <p>The third year I was presenting was perfect for me, what with Jack Palance winning. I tell you, it was the greatest running gag in the history of the Oscars. </p> <p>When Jack won, I came back on and said: \"Jack's now on a Stairmaster backstage - he may enter the Iron Man competition.\" Then I said: \"We'll keep you posted.\" That's when the light really went on. We went to commercial and I said to the two or three writers backstage: \"We're going to run with this. Next time I come out, what will I tell them he's done?\" We started pitching lines. When I came back out of commercial break, I said: \"Jack Palance just bungee-jumped off the Hollywood sign.\" The audience went nuts. The next time I came on was after a big production number with 50 kids from the film Hook. I turned to the audience and said: \"You know, Jack's the father of all of these children.\" And I just kept running it the whole night, right until I said: \"I won't be your host next year, it'll be Jack Palance. Goodnight.\" </p> <p>The other moment I would pick out was when Hal Roach didn't have the microphone on and the show stopped dead. It looked like he was talking to nobody. I said: \"Well, it's appropriate because he got his start in silent films.\" And the place went nuts. At that point, I was really a good comedian, as good as I've ever been. I saved the moment. If I never do any stand-up again, that moment, that little millisecond of that moment, is like a great thing and I felt great about it. </p> <p>I needed to stop presenting the Oscars. I was burnt out on doing award shows. So I stayed home, a guy brought a pizza over, and I watched it and said what everybody who watches the Oscars says: \"Why is this so long?\" </p> <p> <strong> Angelina Jolie</strong> </p> <p>\u0095 Won best supporting actress for Girl, Interrupted in 2000 </p> <p>My dad [Jon Voight] kept his Oscar in a goldfish bowl on his mother's mantel piece in New York. I've never held it. I grew up thinking it was just this strange thing in grandma's house. </p> <p>My parents came over to the hotel when I was getting ready [for last year's ceremony]. They both surprised me and brought gifts. My dad gave me something from my whole family that said: \"We love you and we're proud of you.\" That's all that mattered. There are other actors and actresses that I admire so much and I'm so happy to be in a room with them. That they would think it was OK to put me on stage for a minute is, you know, I just feel like, you know, those moments where you feel OK. It's like you may be living your life right, you know. </p> <p>I really didn't expect [to win]. We grew up in this business and, you know, dad has an Oscar and it's like the big thing you try to attain as an actor. We've always watched it and so we both were sitting there and I think we were both going: \"Can you believe we're here and they let us in?\" I don't think he could really move. He stayed in his seat. </p> <p> <strong> Jenny Shircore</strong> </p> <p>\u0095 Make-up artist who won an Oscar for Elizabeth in 1999 </p> <p>On the day of the Oscars, I woke up with a very bad hangover. Our lot got round the pool at the Four Seasons and had breakfast. Everybody stays there. I remember seeing Andie MacDowell. Then you go and get some free sunglasses. Calvin Klein or somebody like that gives them to you so you're seen walking in with them on. The limos arrive - each nominee has one - at about four, and it takes ages to get to the place because there are about 2,000 limos. But it's OK because you get a bottle of champagne in the limo. </p> <p>The whole thing takes about four or five hours and it's great fun. Whoopi Goldberg was very entertaining. But the strange thing was, when we got to the auditorium, I saw a crowd of people waiting outside. I imagined that they were waiting for free tickets. But, in fact, if you leave your seat at any time, immediately it's filled by one of these people, so the camera never passes an empty seat. You come back from the loo and find someone in your seat. </p> <p>People tend to keep their speeches short, but Gwyneth Paltrow went on and on and on. She thanked her parents, her brother, her grandparents, her great-grandparents, everyone. Cate Blanchett looked the most wonderful - I really think she should have won best actress for Elizabeth. The amazing thing is that everybody wants to hold the Oscar - people grab you in the street and have their photograph taken with it. </p> <p> <strong> Jack Nicholson</strong> </p> <p>\u0095 Won best actor for One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest in 1976 and As Good as It Gets in 1998. Won best supporting actor for Terms of Endearment in 1984. Has been nominated on eight other occasions </p> <p>I dropped about three quarts of water the minute they said my name. Up until then I was numb, very nervous. Usually I just come out because I like seeing movie stars, having a good time and all that, but I was real nervous. </p> <p>I find it a little bit strange. I'm looking around at stars, like you are, and I feel almost like I shouldn't be here. You know, when I saw my picture come up on the television set, I was kind of shocked. I looked real on there. </p> <p>Having a career that covers three decades is nice. Won one in the 70s, one in the 80s, and one the 90s. I'm really happy. You know, one of the things I meant to say in my speech was if you have young children, you always wish they get to see you do something big, you know. So I know they were sitting home having a ball. They don't know the difference between this and bowling, but they know dad won and that was great for me. </p> <p>All comparisons are odious, as my mother told me. I always have a good time working. I suppose those of you who know anything about me know I've always worked with good directors. I choose material well and after that I think I'm lucky.\" </p> <p> <strong> Freddie Francis</strong> </p> <p>\u0095 Cinematographer who won Oscars for Sons and Lovers in 1961 and Glory in 1990. He is the only person in history to win Oscars for a B&amp;W and colour film </p> <p>The first time I won an Oscar, they didn't send lowly people like cinematographers out there. So, as I was working at the time, I didn't go. It came slightly out of the blue as well. I read that I was nominated in American Cinematographer magazine, then they notified me. </p> <p>With Glory, the company looked after me royally - limousines pick you up to take you to the awards ceremony, and people are always giving lunches and dinners and you're invited to them in the meantime. It's really like showbusiness should be. The ceremony itself seems to go on for ever, although I must say it's a very exciting ceremony - by the time I got the second Oscar I'd been in the business a hell of a long time, but I was still excited to be there. If I said everybody was there, I'd be right. The terrible thing is I can't remember offhand who even presented it. </p> <p>I've been in movies since I left school, but once you're at the Oscars, you feel that the whole thing has been worthwhile. You feel that you're equal to the rest of them - mind you, I'd always thought that. It's instilled into you not to say too much, and there's very little you can say, really. Some people go through a list saying I want to thank this and that, which is nonsense, because if you're serious about it you've won it with your own talent. </p> <p>It's like going to the theatre - all the seats are allocated, and you just sit down and have a pleasant evening. It was getting on a bit by the time it was over, and I think we just went to bed. Obviously, you stand around for a while and people come up and admire the statuette, but other than that, I didn't do anything afterwards. Lots of people go off to party, but I'm not a party bird really, so I had a few pleasant conversations and went to bed. </p> <p> <strong> Michael Caine</strong> </p> <p>\u0095 Won best supporting actor for Hannah and Her Sisters in 1987 and The Cider House Rules in 2000. Nominated best actor for Alfie in 1967, Sleuth in 1973 and Educating Rita in 1984 </p> <p>It is very, very, very nerve-wracking. I thought that every single person in my category could have won. So I didn't feel that there was any real winner, I was just there to collect it for all of us. I'm a survivor, that's why they gave it to me. I'm still here after all these years. </p> <p>When you see all the performances on the enormous screen in there, it's quite astonishing. We were all just as good as each other, so why should one of us win? I pointed out that they don't say \"The winner is ...\" any more. They say \"The Oscar goes to ...\" and that was when I decided. I turned around and saw Michael [Clarke Duncan] and Tom [Cruise], then I saw little Haley [Joel Osment] and I didn't know where Jude Law was sitting - and I thought: \"This can't go by without mentioning their performances.\" So I did. </p> <p>I went up the steps and turned. That's when I sort of went. The standing ovation threw me, 'cos it's not something you expect. I could hardly believe it. I'm very difficult to throw and they did it. To be held in such regard in a town so full of talent is an incredible compliment. </p> <p>I thought [Billy Crystal's tribute] was wonderful. He sang that song and had everybody going: \"Caine!\" I thought: \"This is the cream of Hollywood here, singing my name!\" I mean, I thought: \"It's OK if I don't win, you know, it's OK, it's OK.\" But it's not OK, I won. I didn't win. See, you say win. Even I'm doing it. </p> <p> <strong> Rachel Portman</strong> </p> <p>\u0095 Composer who won for Emma in 1997, was nominated for The Cider House Rules in 2000 and Chocolat this year </p> <p>You have to drive about 10 miles and it takes two hours, then you hang around, and the whole thing starts at around 5.30 and ends about 10. Then you go to the ball, then you start going off to all the parties. It's funny - if you've won you get this elation, but of course four-fifths of all the people at the parties haven't won. You can't pretend that it isn't nice to have won. On the one hand it doesn't mean anything, on the other it means a lot. It's the only event in which you're nominated by your peers, after all. </p> <p>People do let their hair down and enjoy themselves at the parties, and you're bound to see massively famous actors which is quite fun too. The parties aren't particularly cliquey, although some are harder to get into than others. The most extraordinary aspect of the whole thing is that there is such a big build-up, and then it's over in a flash, completely forgotten, and everything goes back to normal. </p> <p>I was glad Michael Caine won best actor last year, but it was annoying: if you go to the bathroom you aren't allowed back to your seat until the commercial break, and while I was gone I missed three in a row, including his. The corridors outside are full of people not allowed to go back to their seat. The acceptance speeches are the most entertaining part, but they're very strict now about how much time you've got. When I went up there, the minute I started talking I was aware of this man in my sightline, looking at me and waving, saying: \"10, 9, 8, 7 ...\" </p> <p>But nobody pays much notice. The guy who won best supporting actor for Jerry Maguire - Cuba Gooding Jr - went on and on and on, started jumping up and down, and was a real star. He was genuinely, really thrilled. </p> <p>People wear the most extraordinary things - spray-on dresses. Julia Roberts stood out for having so much grace and style, but what most people wear is fascinating rather than beautiful. The Oscars couldn't be more glamorous. I'm taking my sister this year, who lives a very quiet life up in Scotland and she can't believe it. I think it's more exciting for her than it is for me. </p> <p> <strong> Martin Childs</strong> </p> <p>\u0095 Art director, won an Oscar for Shakespeare in Love in 1999 and is nominated for Quills this year </p> <p>The day starts with a nervous breakfast around the pool as soon as the LA Times comes out, which has predictions of who will win the awards. It was a surprise that Shakespeare in Love was top - we all thought it was going to be Saving Private Ryan. Then I realised that I was the favourite. Up until then I had no idea. </p> <p>The limo turns up filled with champagne at about 3.30. When we got in we realised that the driver didn't know her way around LA so we arrived very late. We were quite literally locked out. Luckily Judi Dench was in the car with us and they recognised her. So we said, \"We're nominees too!\" and managed to get in. If you watch the video you can see these people quietly stomping over to their seats with bended knees just as James Coburn is announced as best supporting actor. Then within five minutes someone came up to me and said: \"Are you Martin Childs? You're up next.\" </p> <p>Before I knew it I was doing my acceptance speech, nervous as a cat, and this huge monitor in front of me said \"Wrap up\" almost as soon as I'd begun. You don't think about the millions of people looking at you, but you do look down to see Warren Beatty and Annette Bening lightly clapping a few feet away. Then you have to go up to a room to talk to the press, who make it very clear that they'd rather be talking to a big star and not some speccy bloke from England who's won an award for drawing some pictures. </p> <p>The year I went, there were all these people with banners outside protesting against Elia Kazan getting a lifetime achievement award because of his involvement with the House Un-American Activities Committee. Then when he went up to collect it, Susan Sarandon and Ed Harris pointedly didn't applaud. It was very silly - just because he did a bad thing it doesn't meant that his films weren't good. I did the British thing and clapped politely while hiding behind a chair, just in case Susan Sarandon saw me. </p> <p>I also remember Sophia Loren looking absolutely stunning. This year I hope Penelope Cruz will be there - she's already won for most glamorous actress as far as I'm concerned. After the Governor's Ball we went to the Miramax party, which is a legendary one. There was no getting out of it for me, considering I had won an award for Shakespeare in Love [a Miramax production]. This year I probably won't be invited to anything. </p> <p> <strong> Stephen Frears</strong> </p> <p>\u0095 Nominated as best director for The Grifters in 1991 </p> <p>They go on for hours. You get dressed up at three o'clock in the afternoon so you feel like a waiter shortly after lunch. Ten years ago, people didn't get as excited about these things as they do now - I got home one day and there were a lot of messages on the phone from people congratulating me on my nomination. I didn't even know I was up for it. Nowadays people go out and campaign to win but I was actually in California at the time preparing Accidental Hero for Columbia studios. </p> <p>The night before the Oscars I was told that with The Grifters I'd won a prize for best independent film of the year. I said: \"I see the prize for best independent film is that you get to give up your independence.\" There's an enormous traffic jam while long cars filled with famous people inch down the spider's web to a building in Los Angeles. Once you are inside you soon discover that you can go to the bar with impunity because people fill your seat if you leave it empty. </p> <p>I don't remember anyone making spectacular idiots of themselves. Joe Pesci won a prize that year and his acceptance speech was: \"Thank you very much. I'm honoured.\" Hats off for brevity. It's changed because the British press have got over-excited about the whole event but it's only jerks like me who are the voters. Pauline Collins was funny. She said: \"I'm only here for the beer.\" And Danny Boyle came out and said: \"We wuz robbed.\" </p> <p>Kevin Costner had won as best director for Dances With Wolves the year I went, beating Scorsese, who was there with GoodFellas. Scorsese was sitting there very depressed and I remember saying to him: \"Surely you knew that you weren't going to win.\" When Billy Wilder won the second of the three Oscars he won for The Apartment, Moss Hart handed him the trophy saying: \"Quit while you're ahead.\" And it was good advice; that was the peak of Wilder's career. </p> <p>I imagine it's always a cruel evening. Afterwards there's a do called the Governor's Ball, then a lot of famous people hang around, waiting for their limos to be brought. That year it was raining. </p> <p> <strong> Russell Crowe</strong> </p> <p>\u0095 Nominated best actor for The Insider in 2000 and this year for Gladiator </p> <p>It's great, man, what can I say? It's the highest acknowledgement in my profession. So, I don't have any glib lines about it. I'm not cynical about it at all. I was blown away last year and this year even more so. I don't have the time, funnily enough, to kind of come in and really enjoy the process of it because I always seem to be working. But maybe that's actually a good thing. The food's not as fancy as my mum's cooking, mate. She's a damn fine cook. She was a caterer for film and TV shows from the late 60s for about six or seven years and, in 1969, we had bean curd, which is tofu, in the refrigerator and I was the only kid that had that. I couldn't eat it, but we had it. </p> <p> <strong> Alisandra M Rand</strong> </p> <p>\u0095 Producer/writer, Fast Track Pictures; 1994 Oscar attendee </p> <p>I was invited by a friend. Actually I forced him (and it wasn't so easy) to take me, his friend, rather than use it as a way to get laid on some hot date. I wore a black sequinned dress, a flapper dress. The one formal dress I'd brought from Boston because as mom said: \"You just never know.\" And this time she was right. </p> <p>I ran to the guy who cuts my hair, a crazy Frenchman, Didier, who's got a shop on Main Street in Santa Monica called Scissors. He gave me big hair, even though he told me it was out that year. Of course that just added to my jitters. And he did my make-up. Even gave me a lipstick. </p> <p>I'll never forget being all dressed up in the middle of the afternoon in that crazy southern California heat, trying to get close to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in a borrowed convertible with all the fans flocking to catch a glimpse of the stars. And the red carpet - my God! This was before I'd been to a million and one premieres. I was still a grad student for Christ's sake, and though I was embarrassed to admit it, at the time, I'd probably only seen the show once on TV. The red carpet was pretty overwhelming. </p> <p>Everywhere, I looked there was someone famous. Funny thing about famous people - you have the same reaction you do to people you haven't seen since high school. You're excited to see them, and then you think: \"Huh, do I really have anything to say to them?\" And then you follow the code - give them their space, pretend they're just normal people dressed up for the opera - and kick yourself later for not having thought of something clever to say because, had you introduced yourself, who knows, maybe you would have made it in Hollywood. </p> <p>The only thing I really remember about the show itself was running back and forth to the bar, hanging out with the celebrities, having drinks, because, trust me, everyone was bored. It's endless. We weren't, of course, invited to the fancy schmancy ball afterwards. And, though we've since gotten pretty good at getting into parties we have no business being at, that was a bit too intimidating even for us. We went to Le Dome, a famous old bar on Sunset, and watched the after parties on TV, just like everybody else. </p> <p>And after the event, we actually talked to a little-known kid named Leo DiCaprio, who had just been nominated for his performance in What's Eating Gilbert Grape. We told him how impressed we'd been with his work. He told us this was a dream for him, too. He grew up in the area, and Oscar day was always a little like a snow day; everything shut down. He used to watch the limousines pull up to the Oscars, and now he was in one of them. </p> <p>It's funny to think about now. He wasn't big enough then to keep us from keeping protocol and giving him space. Now we couldn't get near him.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Geoffrey Rush \u0095 Won best actor for Shine in 1997, nominated best actor this year for Quills Inevitably, I was flying completely blind. But somewhere in the back of my head there was the absurd notion that, should my name be called, I'd know what to do because I've seen people do it from childhood onward. There are those almost mental, Arthur Murray-type dance steps that say: \"Walk up that staircase, go to the middle, turn to face front.\" So somehow, you get to do that. That was the year that independent film was knocking very loudly at the mainstream door. The Elton John Aids benefit bash afterwards was a great place to be because it was in honour of all the independent films. So there was a lot to celebrate. This year, Giorgio Armani has kindly offered to prepare something. It's a huge event, so that's always nerve-wracking, exciting and bewildering. But I have no anticipation about getting it. It's a cliche to say it's an honour to be nominated - and there are 10 or 20 other performances that should have been in there. People will go into an outrage and a tailspin that their favorites aren't. But the nominations are a good cross-section of what's out there in movieland at the moment. If I've learned anything, having been there twice before and presenting one year, it's to have a couple of soft, poached eggs with a bit of toast at about 2pm because you're not going to get anything in your stomach until about 10. That's a practical tip - if anyone ever wants to write the book What to Do on Oscar Morning. Timothy Everest \u0095 Tom Cruise's tailor Lauren Scott, who looks after Tom Cruise, was appointed Oscars 2000 style director, vetting the clothes of everyone onstage. She asked me to assist. So a week later I was in LA, heading to the ceremony, but I missed my driver and couldn't get anywhere near the Shrine because of the police and security and the fact that my Access All Areas pass had expired at 1pm. My afternoon and evening passes were in our limo. So I was running down the road in black tie looking for the car, which was stuck in the limo-lock, but each time I got near, it pulled another 20 yards further forward. It was like running for a bus. I eventually jumped in just as it was pulling up to the entrance and almost immediately had to get out the other side, red-faced and sweating. We came out on to the red carpet and I did the whole Ronald Reagan thing, saluting and pointing to strangers in the crowd and waving while they all tried to work out who I was. The red carpet is actually really tatty and should probably have been thrown out years ago. The first thing I noticed in the auditorium was that they have all these lookalike seat-filler stand-ins in case someone gets up to receive an award or have a pee or something. I was sitting behind Angelina Jolie and her brother - and they had a gothic-looking stand-in for her and a peroxided double-pierced-ear stand-in for him. I had to keep running out the back and checking clothes and it was like Gerry Cottle's circus. Everyone has their own caravan and some had filled them with flowers and fruit; others just had gigantic bowls of M&amp;Ms. During the commercial breaks everyone just gets up and starts networking. The front row is where the main action is. Clint Eastwood was chatting to Tom Cruise, and Billy Crystal was trying to calm Jack Nicholson down. He's shouting \"Billy, I love you!\" and turning to Erykah Badu behind and going \"I love your headdress!\" and Billy's saying \"I love you too, Jack, but please sit down 'cos we're coming back live in 10, 9, 8 ...\" It's not really a feverish atmosphere; everyone's trying to be very controlled. It's more like a glammed-up works outing. At the Vanity Fair party after, you have these fans checking people off as they go in the door, shouting \"Val!\" and ticking his name off as he waves and goes in, then \"Jude!\" then \"Ethan!\" then \"Uma!\" It's like trainspotting. They all wind up early and I suppose everyone then goes home and has a cup of cocoa. It was a very surreal experience. Tom Hanks \u0095 Won best actor for Philadelphia in 1994 and for Forrest Gump in 1995. Nominated best actor for Big in 1989 and Saving Private Ryan in 1999. Nominated this year for Cast Away My joke the first time I won was that if you're nominated and you don't win, everybody forgets it after a week; if you're nominated and you win, everybody pretty much forgets it after two weeks. I don't think about it any more. We all do it because we love movies and because it's our job and it's also one of the barometers for how you're doing. It's like having a baby. The day you have a baby it's just the greatest thing in the world. Well, the next day you have this baby to take care of and you have the memory of that baby coming out, but other than that, now you're into the nuts and bolts of that one damn thing after another that life seems to be and that's what this is. The day itself is a very personal experience because the family is supercharged, people are stopping by. It's like a wedding. There's a spirit of excitement that lasts about 18 hours and you're exhausted at the end of it. I'm lucky enough to be able to say you're exhausted whether you win or lose. My attention is so splayed in the course of the day that I don't remember what I do from one minute to the next. I don't think it's possible to stick to a prepared script. I always have five things to say and I always screw up one of them, and forget another one completely and then replace the other three with other things that entered my head at the last moment. So, it's not something you can control. It's like suddenly jumping out of an airplane. Billy Crystal \u0095 Host in 1990-93, 1997-8, 2000 The third year I was presenting was perfect for me, what with Jack Palance winning. I tell you, it was the greatest running gag in the history of the Oscars. When Jack won, I came back on and said: \"Jack's now on a Stairmaster backstage - he may enter the Iron Man competition.\" Then I said: \"We'll keep you posted.\" That's when the light really went on. We went to commercial and I said to the two or three writers backstage: \"We're going to run with this. Next time I come out, what will I tell them he's done?\" We started pitching lines. When I came back out of commercial break, I said: \"Jack Palance just bungee-jumped off the Hollywood sign.\" The audience went nuts. The next time I came on was after a big production number with 50 kids from the film Hook. I turned to the audience and said: \"You know, Jack's the father of all of these children.\" And I just kept running it the whole night, right until I said: \"I won't be your host next year, it'll be Jack Palance. Goodnight.\" The other moment I would pick out was when Hal Roach didn't have the microphone on and the show stopped dead. It looked like he was talking to nobody. I said: \"Well, it's appropriate because he got his start in silent films.\" And the place went nuts. At that point, I was really a good comedian, as good as I've ever been. I saved the moment. If I never do any stand-up again, that moment, that little millisecond of that moment, is like a great thing and I felt great about it. I needed to stop presenting the Oscars. I was burnt out on doing award shows. So I stayed home, a guy brought a pizza over, and I watched it and said what everybody who watches the Oscars says: \"Why is this so long?\" Angelina Jolie \u0095 Won best supporting actress for Girl, Interrupted in 2000 My dad [Jon Voight] kept his Oscar in a goldfish bowl on his mother's mantel piece in New York. I've never held it. I grew up thinking it was just this strange thing in grandma's house. My parents came over to the hotel when I was getting ready [for last year's ceremony]. They both surprised me and brought gifts. My dad gave me something from my whole family that said: \"We love you and we're proud of you.\" That's all that mattered. There are other actors and actresses that I admire so much and I'm so happy to be in a room with them. That they would think it was OK to put me on stage for a minute is, you know, I just feel like, you know, those moments where you feel OK. It's like you may be living your life right, you know. I really didn't expect [to win]. We grew up in this business and, you know, dad has an Oscar and it's like the big thing you try to attain as an actor. We've always watched it and so we both were sitting there and I think we were both going: \"Can you believe we're here and they let us in?\" I don't think he could really move. He stayed in his seat. Jenny Shircore \u0095 Make-up artist who won an Oscar for Elizabeth in 1999 On the day of the Oscars, I woke up with a very bad hangover. Our lot got round the pool at the Four Seasons and had breakfast. Everybody stays there. I remember seeing Andie MacDowell. Then you go and get some free sunglasses. Calvin Klein or somebody like that gives them to you so you're seen walking in with them on. The limos arrive - each nominee has one - at about four, and it takes ages to get to the place because there are about 2,000 limos. But it's OK because you get a bottle of champagne in the limo. The whole thing takes about four or five hours and it's great fun. Whoopi Goldberg was very entertaining. But the strange thing was, when we got to the auditorium, I saw a crowd of people waiting outside. I imagined that they were waiting for free tickets. But, in fact, if you leave your seat at any time, immediately it's filled by one of these people, so the camera never passes an empty seat. You come back from the loo and find someone in your seat. People tend to keep their speeches short, but Gwyneth Paltrow went on and on and on. She thanked her parents, her brother, her grandparents, her great-grandparents, everyone. Cate Blanchett looked the most wonderful - I really think she should have won best actress for Elizabeth. The amazing thing is that everybody wants to hold the Oscar - people grab you in the street and have their photograph taken with it. Jack Nicholson \u0095 Won best actor for One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest in 1976 and As Good as It Gets in 1998. Won best supporting actor for Terms of Endearment in 1984. Has been nominated on eight other occasions I dropped about three quarts of water the minute they said my name. Up until then I was numb, very nervous. Usually I just come out because I like seeing movie stars, having a good time and all that, but I was real nervous. I find it a little bit strange. I'm looking around at stars, like you are, and I feel almost like I shouldn't be here. You know, when I saw my picture come up on the television set, I was kind of shocked. I looked real on there. Having a career that covers three decades is nice. Won one in the 70s, one in the 80s, and one the 90s. I'm really happy. You know, one of the things I meant to say in my speech was if you have young children, you always wish they get to see you do something big, you know. So I know they were sitting home having a ball. They don't know the difference between this and bowling, but they know dad won and that was great for me. All comparisons are odious, as my mother told me. I always have a good time working. I suppose those of you who know anything about me know I've always worked with good directors. I choose material well and after that I think I'm lucky.\" Freddie Francis \u0095 Cinematographer who won Oscars for Sons and Lovers in 1961 and Glory in 1990. He is the only person in history to win Oscars for a B&amp;W and colour film The first time I won an Oscar, they didn't send lowly people like cinematographers out there. So, as I was working at the time, I didn't go. It came slightly out of the blue as well. I read that I was nominated in American Cinematographer magazine, then they notified me. With Glory, the company looked after me royally - limousines pick you up to take you to the awards ceremony, and people are always giving lunches and dinners and you're invited to them in the meantime. It's really like showbusiness should be. The ceremony itself seems to go on for ever, although I must say it's a very exciting ceremony - by the time I got the second Oscar I'd been in the business a hell of a long time, but I was still excited to be there. If I said everybody was there, I'd be right. The terrible thing is I can't remember offhand who even presented it. I've been in movies since I left school, but once you're at the Oscars, you feel that the whole thing has been worthwhile. You feel that you're equal to the rest of them - mind you, I'd always thought that. It's instilled into you not to say too much, and there's very little you can say, really. Some people go through a list saying I want to thank this and that, which is nonsense, because if you're serious about it you've won it with your own talent. It's like going to the theatre - all the seats are allocated, and you just sit down and have a pleasant evening. It was getting on a bit by the time it was over, and I think we just went to bed. Obviously, you stand around for a while and people come up and admire the statuette, but other than that, I didn't do anything afterwards. Lots of people go off to party, but I'm not a party bird really, so I had a few pleasant conversations and went to bed. Michael Caine \u0095 Won best supporting actor for Hannah and Her Sisters in 1987 and The Cider House Rules in 2000. Nominated best actor for Alfie in 1967, Sleuth in 1973 and Educating Rita in 1984 It is very, very, very nerve-wracking. I thought that every single person in my category could have won. So I didn't feel that there was any real winner, I was just there to collect it for all of us. I'm a survivor, that's why they gave it to me. I'm still here after all these years. When you see all the performances on the enormous screen in there, it's quite astonishing. We were all just as good as each other, so why should one of us win? I pointed out that they don't say \"The winner is ...\" any more. They say \"The Oscar goes to ...\" and that was when I decided. I turned around and saw Michael [Clarke Duncan] and Tom [Cruise], then I saw little Haley [Joel Osment] and I didn't know where Jude Law was sitting - and I thought: \"This can't go by without mentioning their performances.\" So I did. I went up the steps and turned. That's when I sort of went. The standing ovation threw me, 'cos it's not something you expect. I could hardly believe it. I'm very difficult to throw and they did it. To be held in such regard in a town so full of talent is an incredible compliment. I thought [Billy Crystal's tribute] was wonderful. He sang that song and had everybody going: \"Caine!\" I thought: \"This is the cream of Hollywood here, singing my name!\" I mean, I thought: \"It's OK if I don't win, you know, it's OK, it's OK.\" But it's not OK, I won. I didn't win. See, you say win. Even I'm doing it. Rachel Portman \u0095 Composer who won for Emma in 1997, was nominated for The Cider House Rules in 2000 and Chocolat this year You have to drive about 10 miles and it takes two hours, then you hang around, and the whole thing starts at around 5.30 and ends about 10. Then you go to the ball, then you start going off to all the parties. It's funny - if you've won you get this elation, but of course four-fifths of all the people at the parties haven't won. You can't pretend that it isn't nice to have won. On the one hand it doesn't mean anything, on the other it means a lot. It's the only event in which you're nominated by your peers, after all. People do let their hair down and enjoy themselves at the parties, and you're bound to see massively famous actors which is quite fun too. The parties aren't particularly cliquey, although some are harder to get into than others. The most extraordinary aspect of the whole thing is that there is such a big build-up, and then it's over in a flash, completely forgotten, and everything goes back to normal. I was glad Michael Caine won best actor last year, but it was annoying: if you go to the bathroom you aren't allowed back to your seat until the commercial break, and while I was gone I missed three in a row, including his. The corridors outside are full of people not allowed to go back to their seat. The acceptance speeches are the most entertaining part, but they're very strict now about how much time you've got. When I went up there, the minute I started talking I was aware of this man in my sightline, looking at me and waving, saying: \"10, 9, 8, 7 ...\" But nobody pays much notice. The guy who won best supporting actor for Jerry Maguire - Cuba Gooding Jr - went on and on and on, started jumping up and down, and was a real star. He was genuinely, really thrilled. People wear the most extraordinary things - spray-on dresses. Julia Roberts stood out for having so much grace and style, but what most people wear is fascinating rather than beautiful. The Oscars couldn't be more glamorous. I'm taking my sister this year, who lives a very quiet life up in Scotland and she can't believe it. I think it's more exciting for her than it is for me. Martin Childs \u0095 Art director, won an Oscar for Shakespeare in Love in 1999 and is nominated for Quills this year The day starts with a nervous breakfast around the pool as soon as the LA Times comes out, which has predictions of who will win the awards. It was a surprise that Shakespeare in Love was top - we all thought it was going to be Saving Private Ryan. Then I realised that I was the favourite. Up until then I had no idea. The limo turns up filled with champagne at about 3.30. When we got in we realised that the driver didn't know her way around LA so we arrived very late. We were quite literally locked out. Luckily Judi Dench was in the car with us and they recognised her. So we said, \"We're nominees too!\" and managed to get in. If you watch the video you can see these people quietly stomping over to their seats with bended knees just as James Coburn is announced as best supporting actor. Then within five minutes someone came up to me and said: \"Are you Martin Childs? You're up next.\" Before I knew it I was doing my acceptance speech, nervous as a cat, and this huge monitor in front of me said \"Wrap up\" almost as soon as I'd begun. You don't think about the millions of people looking at you, but you do look down to see Warren Beatty and Annette Bening lightly clapping a few feet away. Then you have to go up to a room to talk to the press, who make it very clear that they'd rather be talking to a big star and not some speccy bloke from England who's won an award for drawing some pictures. The year I went, there were all these people with banners outside protesting against Elia Kazan getting a lifetime achievement award because of his involvement with the House Un-American Activities Committee. Then when he went up to collect it, Susan Sarandon and Ed Harris pointedly didn't applaud. It was very silly - just because he did a bad thing it doesn't meant that his films weren't good. I did the British thing and clapped politely while hiding behind a chair, just in case Susan Sarandon saw me. I also remember Sophia Loren looking absolutely stunning. This year I hope Penelope Cruz will be there - she's already won for most glamorous actress as far as I'm concerned. After the Governor's Ball we went to the Miramax party, which is a legendary one. There was no getting out of it for me, considering I had won an award for Shakespeare in Love [a Miramax production]. This year I probably won't be invited to anything. Stephen Frears \u0095 Nominated as best director for The Grifters in 1991 They go on for hours. You get dressed up at three o'clock in the afternoon so you feel like a waiter shortly after lunch. Ten years ago, people didn't get as excited about these things as they do now - I got home one day and there were a lot of messages on the phone from people congratulating me on my nomination. I didn't even know I was up for it. Nowadays people go out and campaign to win but I was actually in California at the time preparing Accidental Hero for Columbia studios. The night before the Oscars I was told that with The Grifters I'd won a prize for best independent film of the year. I said: \"I see the prize for best independent film is that you get to give up your independence.\" There's an enormous traffic jam while long cars filled with famous people inch down the spider's web to a building in Los Angeles. Once you are inside you soon discover that you can go to the bar with impunity because people fill your seat if you leave it empty. I don't remember anyone making spectacular idiots of themselves. Joe Pesci won a prize that year and his acceptance speech was: \"Thank you very much. I'm honoured.\" Hats off for brevity. It's changed because the British press have got over-excited about the whole event but it's only jerks like me who are the voters. Pauline Collins was funny. She said: \"I'm only here for the beer.\" And Danny Boyle came out and said: \"We wuz robbed.\" Kevin Costner had won as best director for Dances With Wolves the year I went, beating Scorsese, who was there with GoodFellas. Scorsese was sitting there very depressed and I remember saying to him: \"Surely you knew that you weren't going to win.\" When Billy Wilder won the second of the three Oscars he won for The Apartment, Moss Hart handed him the trophy saying: \"Quit while you're ahead.\" And it was good advice; that was the peak of Wilder's career. I imagine it's always a cruel evening. Afterwards there's a do called the Governor's Ball, then a lot of famous people hang around, waiting for their limos to be brought. That year it was raining. Russell Crowe \u0095 Nominated best actor for The Insider in 2000 and this year for Gladiator It's great, man, what can I say? It's the highest acknowledgement in my profession. So, I don't have any glib lines about it. I'm not cynical about it at all. I was blown away last year and this year even more so. I don't have the time, funnily enough, to kind of come in and really enjoy the process of it because I always seem to be working. But maybe that's actually a good thing. The food's not as fancy as my mum's cooking, mate. She's a damn fine cook. She was a caterer for film and TV shows from the late 60s for about six or seven years and, in 1969, we had bean curd, which is tofu, in the refrigerator and I was the only kid that had that. I couldn't eat it, but we had it. Alisandra M Rand \u0095 Producer/writer, Fast Track Pictures; 1994 Oscar attendee I was invited by a friend. Actually I forced him (and it wasn't so easy) to take me, his friend, rather than use it as a way to get laid on some hot date. I wore a black sequinned dress, a flapper dress. The one formal dress I'd brought from Boston because as mom said: \"You just never know.\" And this time she was right. I ran to the guy who cuts my hair, a crazy Frenchman, Didier, who's got a shop on Main Street in Santa Monica called Scissors. He gave me big hair, even though he told me it was out that year. Of course that just added to my jitters. And he did my make-up. Even gave me a lipstick. I'll never forget being all dressed up in the middle of the afternoon in that crazy southern California heat, trying to get close to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in a borrowed convertible with all the fans flocking to catch a glimpse of the stars. And the red carpet - my God! This was before I'd been to a million and one premieres. I was still a grad student for Christ's sake, and though I was embarrassed to admit it, at the time, I'd probably only seen the show once on TV. The red carpet was pretty overwhelming. Everywhere, I looked there was someone famous. Funny thing about famous people - you have the same reaction you do to people you haven't seen since high school. You're excited to see them, and then you think: \"Huh, do I really have anything to say to them?\" And then you follow the code - give them their space, pretend they're just normal people dressed up for the opera - and kick yourself later for not having thought of something clever to say because, had you introduced yourself, who knows, maybe you would have made it in Hollywood. The only thing I really remember about the show itself was running back and forth to the bar, hanging out with the celebrities, having drinks, because, trust me, everyone was bored. It's endless. We weren't, of course, invited to the fancy schmancy ball afterwards. And, though we've since gotten pretty good at getting into parties we have no business being at, that was a bit too intimidating even for us. We went to Le Dome, a famous old bar on Sunset, and watched the after parties on TV, just like everybody else. And after the event, we actually talked to a little-known kid named Leo DiCaprio, who had just been nominated for his performance in What's Eating Gilbert Grape. We told him how impressed we'd been with his work. He told us this was a dream for him, too. He grew up in the area, and Oscar day was always a little like a snow day; everything shut down. He used to watch the limousines pull up to the Oscars, and now he was in one of them. It's funny to think about now. He wasn't big enough then to keep us from keeping protocol and giving him space. Now we couldn't get near him.",

Yet why should it be? Why should the film not invest soap with the same cultural supercharge that Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger gave the kung-fu serial? And why should it not harness some of the power that soap has, which sophisticated critical opinion now readily and enthusiastically concedes? </p> <p>It's got everything: a Peyton Place-ish location in small-town Scottsville, NY, and an involved family drama: a single mother, an absent father, covert sexual shenanigans, a Prodigal Son, and the fraught dual existences of home and office.

In one Crossroads-ish moment, the microphone appears at the top of frame, perhaps the most blatant invasion in recent memory. The fluffy boom practically comes down and musses up Linney's hair-do: you can get this sort of accidental alienation effect in any feature film, but removing it in post-production costs money - so in it stays. </p> <p>Linney gives a thoroughly credible performance as single mother Sammy, holding down a white-collar job in a bank and looking after her son, Rudy. The boy's role is given to Rory Culkin, brother of the egregious Macaulay and a fine example of the way in which child acting has developed since the young Home Alone prince bestrode the world. Then it was big and brash; now, since Haley Joel Osment's success in The Sixth Sense, it's de rigueur for boys to do this sensitive, quiet little voice, a teeny-weeny voice emanating from somewhere within the recesses of his T-shirt. Sammy is bright, chipper, community-minded, a church-going, priest-consulting sort of woman who lives in the house where she was brought up (parents killed in a car crash long since), but combines these wholesome attributes with a matter-of-fact meeting of her bedroom needs with an on-off boyfriend. Linney plays all these aspects adroitly - it's an accessible, unassuming performance, far from her opaque and intimidating Bertha Dorset in Terence Davies's The House of Mirth. </p> <p>When her sloppy, whiny and clearly druggy brother Terry (Mark Ruffalo) turns up out of the blue, Linney pulls off the considerable feat of conveying anger, relief and love: she's been worried about him; she's delighted to have him back; she's furious that he wants to touch her for another loan. But he comes in useful for looking after young Rudy, while she pursues an affair with her new boss, played by Matthew Broderick. </p> <p>This is great stuff from Broderick, a hugely enjoyable development of his uptight teacher-figure in Alexander Payne's classic Election. He is prissy, anally retentive and an appalling control freak: he and Linney have so much in common. They rub each other up the wrong way, and yet end up having a raunchy scene in a motel room - a scene made all the hotter for being so real. Broderick has an extraordinary knack of portraying lasciviousness with pomposity, self-pity and self-congratulation - he appears, post-Ferris, to have hit a rich seam with this archetypal middle-American middle-class male. </p> <p>Linney and Ruffalo as brother and sister turn in actorly, masterclass performances that perhaps owe more to the techniques of the stage than the cinema. Their relationship gives meaning to the phrase emotional intelligence. It is premier league screen acting and Ruffalo's final \"goodbye\" speech to his sister will live on as an audition piece for the next few decades, I predict, as well as enforcing quite a few sniffles in the cinema. They demonstrate an acute and responsive approach to Lonergan's writing - a script that sets out to hit a lot of emotional buttons, coming sometimes quite close to the melodrama of the daytime small-screen. But the two principals, happily cast and directed, shape it back into a dramatic piece of clarity and force. </p> <p>It is a film with the virtues of classic American furniture: sturdy, unfussy, pleasingly substantial. And the star, Laura Linney, has it all. She can do a steamy sex scene, she can get laughs, she can provoke tears - and most importantly of all she is loyal to the American small town. It's the kind of sentiment and range that the Academy loves, and she surely deserves to beat Julia Roberts to that statuette next week.</p>",

Sammy is bright, chipper, community-minded, a church-going, priest-consulting sort of woman who lives in the house where she was brought up (parents killed in a car crash long since), but combines these wholesome attributes with a matter-of-fact meeting of her bedroom needs with an on-off boyfriend. Linney plays all these aspects adroitly - it's an accessible, unassuming performance, far from her opaque and intimidating Bertha Dorset in Terence Davies's The House of Mirth. When her sloppy, whiny and clearly druggy brother Terry (Mark Ruffalo) turns up out of the blue, Linney pulls off the considerable feat of conveying anger, relief and love: she's been worried about him; she's delighted to have him back; she's furious that he wants to touch her for another loan. But he comes in useful for looking after young Rudy, while she pursues an affair with her new boss, played by Matthew Broderick. This is great stuff from Broderick, a hugely enjoyable development of his uptight teacher-figure in Alexander Payne's classic Election. He is prissy, anally retentive and an appalling control freak: he and Linney have so much in common. They rub each other up the wrong way, and yet end up having a raunchy scene in a motel room - a scene made all the hotter for being so real. Broderick has an extraordinary knack of portraying lasciviousness with pomposity, self-pity and self-congratulation - he appears, post-Ferris, to have hit a rich seam with this archetypal middle-American middle-class male. Linney and Ruffalo as brother and sister turn in actorly, masterclass performances that perhaps owe more to the techniques of the stage than the cinema. Their relationship gives meaning to the phrase emotional intelligence. It is premier league screen acting and Ruffalo's final \"goodbye\" speech to his sister will live on as an audition piece for the next few decades, I predict, as well as enforcing quite a few sniffles in the cinema. They demonstrate an acute and responsive approach to Lonergan's writing - a script that sets out to hit a lot of emotional buttons, coming sometimes quite close to the melodrama of the daytime small-screen. But the two principals, happily cast and directed, shape it back into a dramatic piece of clarity and force. It is a film with the virtues of classic American furniture: sturdy, unfussy, pleasingly substantial. And the star, Laura Linney, has it all. She can do a steamy sex scene, she can get laughs, she can provoke tears - and most importantly of all she is loyal to the American small town. It's the kind of sentiment and range that the Academy loves, and she surely deserves to beat Julia Roberts to that statuette next week.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Keeping the Faith</strong><br> Rental and DVD rental Buena Vista Cert 12<br></p> <p>A romantic comedy with an IQ, which already makes it a bit of a rarity. Edward Norton and Ben Stiller are the boyhood friends who grow up to be a Catholic priest and a rabbi in New York. Jenna Elfman is the childhood friend turned high-powered businesswoman who causes emotional chaos during a visit. Keeping the Faith benefits from a smart and eccentric script by Stuart Blumberg, a debutant in director Norton, and good pacing and timing from its reliable leads. It feels like friends having fun together and letting us in on the joke. It also shows a fond regard for New York's great ethnic diversity - the plot unfolds as a drunk Norton's confession to a barman who turns out to be a Sikh Catholic Muslim with Jewish in-laws. In one of the film's most warmly funny scenes, Stiller imports a black choir into his synagogue in despair at the standard of the congregation's singing. Norton and Stiller treat preaching as a form of stand-up comedy while they consider a joint Jewish and Irish religious centre. Phrases like \"kosher nostra\" get flung around and for an hour or so, this is a breath of fresh air in the rather fetid ambience we call rom-com. So it's a big disappointment when Norton allows it a very orthodox (if not Orthodox) ending. </p> <p><strong>Dancer in the Dark</strong><br> VCI/FilmFour Retail and DVD (\u00a319.99) Cert 15<br></p> <p>Perhaps the most controversial Cannes winner ever - the announcement that it had won the Golden Palm was met with a storm of booing - and it's easy to see why. In the first place, Lars von Trier's Dogme style (wobbly camerawork and apparent improvisation) is all wrong for a musical. In the second, our heroine, Bj\u00f6rk, has to fight against the kind of manipulative plotting you thought had gone out with weepies in the silent cinema era. She's going blind, her son's going blind and she is horribly mistreated by people she thought were her friends. Director von Trier pulled off the greatest heartbreaker of the last decade in Breaking the Waves, which makes you wonder how he could get it so spectacularly wrong here. If we are supposed to be sobbing at the plight of our plucky heroine trapped in Robin Day specs and big Pauline Fowler cardigans, the natural reaction is to laugh at the Danish director's outrageous manipulation, Dickensian sentimentality and careless plotting. \"In a musical, nothing dreadful ever happens,\" says Ms Gudmundsdottir. In this one, it's all so dreadful you wonder if the enigmatic director is having a joke at our expense, especially in the shock ending. It's especially a shame for Bj\u00f6rk, (who has showed she can dominate a camera with no props in the video for Big Time Sensuality and did her own little mini-musical in It's Oh So Quiet) and for Catherine Deneuve, once the star of a stylish musical, The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, and here lumbered with a ludicrous best friend/fairy godmother role. For incongruous musical numbers, stick to Always Look on the Bright Side of Life, which, come to think of it, would have worked rather well with the finale here. </p> <p><strong>Freeway II</strong><br> Rental High Fliers Cert 18<br> </p> <p>Aka Confessions of a Trickbaby. Gleefully trashy and outrageous road movie in which Crystal (armed robber, sexual psychopath, drug dealer, car thief and bulimic daughter of a crack addict) busts out of prison with Cyclona (just your basic delusional serial killer lesbian). They hit the road and make for Tijuana to see Cyclona's favourite nun, Sister Gomez. Crystal is played by the magisterially stroppy Natasha Lyonne and Sister Gomez, surprisingly turns out to be the great lost auteur Vincent Gallo. John Landis also turns up as a judge. Huge amounts of violence and throwing up ensue and it's sporadically very funny. Stylistically, this is like a Roger Corman 1970s exploitation film, or a twisted sister to Gregg Araki's recent trilogy of doomed kids. It's \"based on Hansel and Gretel\" (as the bloody Freeway, starring Reese Witherspoon, was based on Little Red Riding Hood) but only a contracts lawyer could spot the similarity. Good original soundtrack too: Surf Trio and Veruca Salt, we salute you. </p>",

The Albanian dropped to his knees and threw the grenade in the direction of the running policeman. It landed at his feet but failed to explode. At the moment the grenade was thrown, a cordon of Macedonian troops, positioned behind sandbags, unleashed a volley of gunfire at the Albanian. At first he slumped against the car, then fell on the kerb, dead. His fellow Albanian was also shot a few yards away. The Tetevo area was braced for further violence last night as news of the killings spread. What's going on? The fighting in Macedonia explained Map: where is Tetovo?

Many of the extremists, including Macedonian Albanians, fought with the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) during Nato's bombing campaign in 1999 and were advised by the SAS, special forces from other Nato countries and the CIA. \"They are very clearly KLA-linked,\" a well-placed Whitehall source said, referring to Albanian guerrillas who have been infiltrating Macedonia.

Some were simply after territory, others were mafia groups or smugglers. They will present a \"long-term problem\", said the sources who added: \"You cannot disinvent a mind-set.\" British military officials described the attacks across the Macedonia border as a \"limited insurgency\" involving between 300 and 800 guerrilla fighters. They were \"well consolidated\" in the hills above Tetovo, Macedonia's second city. British troops have adopted a more robust approach to Albanian extremists than others, notably, until very recently, American soldiers. Defence sources said that all K-For peacekeepers would now adopt a more aggressive presence on the Kosovo side of the Macedonian border.

Significantly, for the first time this week, Robin Cook and Javier Solana, the UN's security supremo, described Albanian guerrillas as \"terrorists\", a term previously used by Russia. In an implicit defence of the KLA's activities during the Kosovo war - and Nato's support for it - Mr Cook argues that there is a huge difference between the \"brutal\" government of the former Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, and the multi-ethnic democratic government of Macedonia. \"This is not Kosovo,\" said a senior defence official.

      "bodyText": "Hopes of racing resuming in Ireland next month have been thrown into grave doubt by the first confirmed case of foot and mouth disease in the Irish Republic. Racing in Ireland had been suspended on February 27 but with only one outbreak, in Northern Ireland, hopes were high for a resumption on April 14. Following yesterday's confirmation of foot and mouth disease at County Louth, that date looks certain to be put back by at least a fortnight. Leading trainer Ted Walsh said: \"Prospects for an early restart look bleak.\" Willie Mullins, president of the Irish Racehorse Trainers' Association, said: \"We are waiting to hear from the Ministry of Agriculture. Hopefully, we can still go ahead on April 14, but it looks as though there might be a further delay.\" Professor Joe Quinn, who is on the minister's team of advisors, said: \"We must continue to take things very carefully. I would imagine racing would be very much in doubt now. The sport has been hit pretty bad, but I suppose it's only a small price when you consider what some people are having to pay.\" Any chance of Irish horses coming over for the Grand National or the Cheltenham Festival are even more remote than before, while the four-day Punchestown Festival, starting April 24, looks certain to be cancelled. Further delay would put paid to the Irish National Hunt season and also throw preparations for their Flat into turmoil. Martin Heffernan of the Irish agricultural ministry press office, said: \"The view of the department's expert group is that horse racing still remains a category 3 event (high risk). \"It is up to the horse racing authorities to decide if they wish to race, but in light of the confirmed foot and mouth outbreak, the agriculture ministry may impose a ban on all horse movement which would prevent a resumption of racing on April 14. \"There is already a ban on transport of horses except under permit.\" \u0095Today's National Hunt card at Newbury is under threat from waterlogging.

The ministry concluded it was the safest way to control the virulent type O virus after watching the fraught British experience where the authorities were unable to keep up with the outbreaks and failed to control the rapid spread of the disease round the country.</p> <p>The new Dutch policy was developed in the past few days but the ministry yesterday said that it followed \"intense\" discussions with all parties, including vets and farmers.</p> <p>Many European countries are now preparing similar \"Plan B\" type policies which combine rapid slaughter with vaccination. But although vaccination is superficially attractive, it is not foolproof .It must be of the right type, it must be administered quickly, it can take several days to kick in, and crucially, depending on whether the vaccinated animals are later slaughtered, it can take up to a year after the last case before the country resumes its exports.</p> <p>The Irish government, which confirmed its first case yesterday, dismissed vaccination. \"We are not considering it for the moment\", an embassy agriculture spokesman said. This is partly for geographical reasons, because they believe the outbreak can be relatively easily contained, but mainly for economic reasons. Ireland exports \u00a35bn of meat a year, compared to Britain's \u00a3400m, and the fear of a loss of exports worth 10% of GNP for up to a year is too great to take.</p> <p>Spain has indicated that it would vaccinate if outbreaks were found in Portugal. In Germany, where several states said yesterday that they were \"expecting\" outbreaks, the environment minister of the North Rhine Westphalia state urged the federal government to drop its opposition to vaccination. Hesse state has already said that it was preparing plans for emergency vaccinations.</p> <p>The US veterinary service, which last year ran a mock outbreak to test its preparedness, concluded that slaughter alone, its first option, might not be enough to contain a major outbreak.</p> <p>The British experience has been closely watched in all countries. The lessons learned, said one European government spokesman yesterday, is that you have to act extremely fast. \"It seems that Britain did not go fast enough. In just a few days the virus can spread far and wide. Vaccination may be an option but only if you move quickly.\"</p> <p>Yesterday in London, the Soil Association, which represents many of Britain's organic farmers called for emergency vaccination to be used. \"The time has come for a rethink on the slaughter-only policy, said broadcaster Jonathan Dimbleby, the organisation's president.</p> <p>\"There should be a wide debate. Vaccination is a tool we should be thinking of using. A slaughter-only policy only works if you deal with the outlying areas, which has not happened. It has been demonstrated to be effective in a number of outbreaks in the 1980s and 1990s.\"</p> <p>Britain has so far strongly resisted vaccination for veterinary reasons, but some observers say it may be that the virus has now spread too far to be able to be contained by vaccination. It would be logistically difficult if not impossible to ring vast areas in Cumbria and the Scottish borders, and the West country, though a consensus is building that it could be worth trying to inoculate around some of the more isolated outbreaks.</p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br><a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,443686,00.html\">Full list: outbreaks </a><br> <a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,460510,00.html\">Full list: closed &amp; cancelled</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html  \">Causes and effects</a></p> <p><b>The front line</b><br> <a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,459872,00.html\">20.03.2001: Looking forward to easter, nervously</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html  \">06.03.2001: Meet our panel</a><br>What is the situation on the ground?

Every TA centre in Britain has an instructor from the regular army.

Then in conjunction with Maff and the vets, we come up with the best plan of how to dispose of the animals.

To all intents and purposes, life on this farm goes on, but underneath the monotony of our day-to-day chores, the reality is very different.</p> <p>We all feel like sitting ducks, waiting to be the next farm to go. Two more of our friends have had their holdings confirmed as infected and the disease is travelling much too fast. Now it has reached a farm just north of Haltwhistle and Peter is very worried it will simply rip along the Roman Wall corridor from west to east and annihilate us.</p> <p>Meanwhile the preparations for lambing continue: I have a long list of medicines to collect from the vet and one for the agricultural merchants. The freezers and cupboards must be full, as there is no time to shop when the lambing starts. Every year we have two extra casual staff who help us. Archie Hall (a retired shepherd) comes for four or five weeks, and Ian Todd will be coming for three weeks.</p> <p>Ian is taking holiday from his normal office-based job to come. As he is worried about bringing infection in to the farm he will move in with us next week. We'll have to do some furniture-moving this weekend to give him his own bedroom and bathroom suite. We'll be six for every meal, and in order to cope with the immense physical work and long hours the meals must be big and nourishing.</p> <p>Margaret Addison farms near Penrith. I spoke to her at the beginning of the week and although she was anxious (as we all are) all was well. But now their animals have contracted foot and mouth and they are to be killed (probably today).

      "bodyText": "Our second new calf of the season has been safely delivered, and Peter and Graham (our shepherd cum stockman) are cleaning out the big cow shed. To all intents and purposes, life on this farm goes on, but underneath the monotony of our day-to-day chores, the reality is very different. We all feel like sitting ducks, waiting to be the next farm to go. Two more of our friends have had their holdings confirmed as infected and the disease is travelling much too fast. Now it has reached a farm just north of Haltwhistle and Peter is very worried it will simply rip along the Roman Wall corridor from west to east and annihilate us. Meanwhile the preparations for lambing continue: I have a long list of medicines to collect from the vet and one for the agricultural merchants. The freezers and cupboards must be full, as there is no time to shop when the lambing starts. Every year we have two extra casual staff who help us. Archie Hall (a retired shepherd) comes for four or five weeks, and Ian Todd will be coming for three weeks. Ian is taking holiday from his normal office-based job to come. As he is worried about bringing infection in to the farm he will move in with us next week. We'll have to do some furniture-moving this weekend to give him his own bedroom and bathroom suite. We'll be six for every meal, and in order to cope with the immense physical work and long hours the meals must be big and nourishing. Margaret Addison farms near Penrith. I spoke to her at the beginning of the week and although she was anxious (as we all are) all was well. But now their animals have contracted foot and mouth and they are to be killed (probably today). The nearest other case to their holding is five miles away and Margaret blames the seagulls swooping in from the Solway, drawn in by newly ploughed fields. Their 350 ewes are in the middle of lambing, and all their stock including a pedigree Simmental cattle herd, built up over many years, is to be destroyed. The vet came quite quickly to look at their sick cow, and the diagnosis didn't take long. The problem is still the disposal. Margaret has been told there will be a wait of 10 to 12 days for a pyre.

Fewer than 24 hours after the US told 50 alleged Russian spies to pack their bags in the wake of the arrest of the suspected FBI spy Robert Hanssen, the Russian foreign ministry was reported to be preparing to expel an unspecified number of alleged US agents from Moscow. Russia's foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, telephoned the US secretary of state, Colin Powell, and told him that Russia did not want to get rid of the American diplomats but that \"adequate measures\" had to be taken after Wednesday's action by the US. None of Washington's expulsions was justified, Mr Ivanov told Mr Powell. The exact number of Americans being expelled was not immediately clear, but Reuters reported Mr Ivanov as confirming that 50 would be involved. The ministry of foreign affairs, in a statement to the Interfax news agency last night, denied that Mr Ivanov had said 50 Americans were involved. \"Russia will respond adequately. You will not have to wait long,\" the ministry quoted Mr Ivanov as saying. President Bush and his top advisers battled to present their action as only a temporary chill in relations with Russia brought on by the Hanssen case. Mr Bush said he expected to have \"a good working relationship\" with Moscow.

Russian anger at the news had been predicted in Washington, but Moscow seemed to be opting for a tone of injured dignity rather than outrage. High-ranking anonymous Kremlin sources said the move to expel such a large number of diplomats would have \"inevitable consequences\" for Russian-US relations.

      "bodyText": "The CIA has abandoned its efforts to persuade Israel and the Palestinians to renew security cooperation, further removing the Bush administration from the Middle East dispute. The agency appears to have arrived at its decision to stop serving as messenger and mediator for two reasons: the six-month uprising which has destroyed Palestinian security cooperation with Israel; and the general resolve of the Bush administration to step back from the conflict. \"We continue to believe the resumption of direct discussions, including the bilateral security cooperation, is a realistic step towards restoring trust and confidence between the parties,\" a US embassy spokesman in Tel Aviv said yesterday. Despite President George Bush's comments this week to the visiting Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, that his administration would facilitate deals, and not impose them, there is deep frustration with the failure to enforce the agreements the CIA helped broker. \"They decided this would not work - being the middle men in security cooperation - so long as neither side, particularly the Palestinians, is keeping deals,\" a US official in Washington said. \"Why would they want the responsibility for two cats that are trying constantly to scratch each other's eyes out?\" The US, Israel and the Palestinians formally entered into a three-way security arrangement in the autumn of 1998, after the Wye Plantation agreement. But the agency began training Palestinian policemen, in an effort to turn guerrilla fighters into a professional force, from 1996. For a time, the arrangements worked, with Palestinian police serving as the frontline of Israel's defence against Islamic militants by jailing hundreds of Islamic Jihad and Hamas activists. Efforts to round up illegal weapons inside the West Bank and Gaza, however, were an utter failure - with only a few dozen guns, many of them antiques, turned in. Although the CIA is stepping back from local security arrangements, its role in the region will not come to an end; it will continue contacts with Israeli intelligence. However, while the uprising continues, it seems unlikely that it can go on with its training programme. The three-way security arrangement had begun to falter even before the Palestinian uprising erupted, with the former prime minister, Ehud Barak, eager to bypass the CIA and barrel ahead into negotiations with the Palestinians. But when the intifada erupted, the CIA took an extraordinarily high-profile role to try to get security cooperation on track. The agency's director, George Tenet, turned up at an emergency summit in the Egyptian resort of Sharm al-Sheikh last October, which provided the guidelines for successive ceasefires that never lasted more than a few days. It was uncertain yesterday what effect the CIA's withdrawal would have on the ground. Joint security cooperation, after all, ended six months ago. But despite the rhetoric of Mr Sharon, who has again taken to referring to the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, as a terrorist, there have been some encouraging signs. Israeli and Palestinian security chiefs met one week ago, and an Israeli army spokesmen said yesterday that Mr Arafat's Palestinian administration recently arrested some of the Islamic militants Israel blames for bombings inside the borders of the Jewish state. However, the military official said the most important members of Hamas and Islamic Jihad remained at large. For the Israeli government, the CIA's withdrawal is unlikely to be seen as a setback. But for the Palestinians, the CIA's decision cuts another of its ties to the corridors of power in Washington. For Mr Arafat - the most frequent official foreign visitor to the White House during the Clinton years - the CIA's involvement was a crucial way of maintaining ties with the US. Last month, Mr Arafat appealed directly to the US secretary of state, Colin Powell, who was on a visit to Ramallah, for the CIA to resume an active role. Mr Powell refused.",

      "body": "<p>Now it's official. The Dow Jones index - symbol of blue-chip America - is in a bear market. A month ago the stock market carnage was confined to the over-hyped bubble stocks of the new economy. Yesterday it was stocks of companies in the real economy that were being caned. </p> <p>The spread of the contagion from the new to the old economy marks a new phase in the stock market decline of the past year. Until now, it had been possible to say that this was simply a case of over-exuberance in one specific sector, and that when the Nasdaq was going down the Dow was going up. No longer. </p> <p>Three questions need to be answered: why is this happening, how much further have the markets got to fall, and what sort of damage will falling share prices do to the real economy around the world? </p> <p>The answer to the first question is pretty simple. Despite all the guff about the dawn of a new golden age in the US, the truth has been much more prosaic. Yes, there has been a surge in productivity since the mid-1990s, but a large chunk of the improvement has been the result of an economy growing unsustainably fast. Britain experienced something similar in the late 1980s, when there was the same loose talk about the economy reaching a new plateau of achievement. </p> <p>The boom, amplified by the laxity of monetary policy in the US to counter the non-existent threat of the millennium bug, turned to bust once the Federal Reserve started to jack up interest rates last year. </p> <p>Growth is slowing down rapidly in the US, consumer and business confidence has fallen sharply, and there has been a blizzard of profits warnings from all parts of the economy.

      "bodyText": "Now it's official. The Dow Jones index - symbol of blue-chip America - is in a bear market. A month ago the stock market carnage was confined to the over-hyped bubble stocks of the new economy. Yesterday it was stocks of companies in the real economy that were being caned. The spread of the contagion from the new to the old economy marks a new phase in the stock market decline of the past year. Until now, it had been possible to say that this was simply a case of over-exuberance in one specific sector, and that when the Nasdaq was going down the Dow was going up. No longer. Three questions need to be answered: why is this happening, how much further have the markets got to fall, and what sort of damage will falling share prices do to the real economy around the world? The answer to the first question is pretty simple. Despite all the guff about the dawn of a new golden age in the US, the truth has been much more prosaic. Yes, there has been a surge in productivity since the mid-1990s, but a large chunk of the improvement has been the result of an economy growing unsustainably fast. Britain experienced something similar in the late 1980s, when there was the same loose talk about the economy reaching a new plateau of achievement. The boom, amplified by the laxity of monetary policy in the US to counter the non-existent threat of the millennium bug, turned to bust once the Federal Reserve started to jack up interest rates last year. Growth is slowing down rapidly in the US, consumer and business confidence has fallen sharply, and there has been a blizzard of profits warnings from all parts of the economy. Alan Greenspan has cut interest rates three times since the start of the year, but - like Nigel Lawson - he is in danger of going from hero to zero in a matter of months. There are those in the market who say this is a good time to buy. With the Nasdaq down more than 60% and the Dow off 20%, the smart investor should be prepared to stick it out for the long haul. The performance of the Nasdaq this week gives some support to this theory, since it has remained fairly stable as the Dow has plunged. However, this assumes that the Nasdaq will bounce back from its current bombed-out levels rather than remain in the doldrums for years to come.

On the other hand, if they are heading toward a more difficult passage in their joint affairs, it can be used to trigger quarrels and stage humiliations that will make things worse. This is not to say that spying and foreign policy are the same thing, but only that they intersect in ways that can be illuminating.</p> <p>The expulsion of the Russians is part of a longer story which probably began late last year with the defection of two senior Russian agents, one at the United Nations in New York, and one in Ottawa. The best guess is that these two provided information that led to the arrest last month of Robert Hanssen, the long time FBI mole whose traitorous career rivalled that of Aldrich Ames at the CIA. Further information from them, as well as the interrogation of Hanssen, may have helped identify some of the 50 now ordered to leave America. Or, more likely, the Americans already knew all or most of these men, but felt they needed a grand expulsion to offset the Hanssen affair.</p> <p>The Hanssen arrest, in any case, may well have been the espionage equivalent of checkmate - a final move compromising everybody on both sides, and therefore making it necessary that the pieces be cleared from the board in preparation for a new game. Still, that could have been done both more gradually and more discreetly.</p> <p>There can be no disputing the value to governments of good intelligence in the broadest sense. The debate over secret intelligence, however, revolves around the question of whether it is an expensive way of providing and protecting vital information or an expensive way of providing and protecting mediocre information.</p> <p>There is the additional liability that intelligence agencies can skew their product to suit the prejudices of politicians or the needs of defence establishments. As far as human intelligence or \"humint\" is is concerned, the modern picture is often not encouraging. The former CIA agent Edward Shirley has written of American spies virtually confined to embassies, rarely walking the streets of the cities to which they are posted, and often without the language or other skills they need to interpret what little they do pick up. He has accused colleagues of pinching their \"intelligence\" from newspapers and pretending it was obtained covertly. But even where both human and other kinds of intelligence, from electronic eavesdropping and surveillance, are both good, there is the problem of interpretation. The history of secret intelligence notoriously shows many cases of good information being ignored or misinterpreted.</p> <p>Counter-intelligence carries special political dangers, since it can become at once an instrument of domestic control and a permanent irritant in foreign relations. The \"foreign enemy\" and the \"internal enemy\" are concepts which feed and grow on each other. In Russia there are some signs of a worrying reversion to the bad habits of Soviet days, with a number of cases under way in which Russians have been accused of espionage for passing along information which was not secret in any military sense.</p> <p>Sometimes the information has been controversial or embarrassing to the Russian state, like revelations about radioactive pollution. Sometimes it has simply been well-organised factual material, all on the public record, supplied to western businesses. Either way, a government run by a former KGB man and which now includes many ex-intelligence people among its officials seems to be signalling that it expects to control information and will punish those who break its rules.</p> <p>Why are Russia and America, and perhaps other western countries as well, still pointing so many of their intelligence big guns at each other? Russia, the Americans say, normally has 450 agents in the United States. The Russians recently claimed to have identified 350 Russians working as spies for foreign states, presumably most of them Nato countries. It is admittedly important to Nato countries, for example, whether Russia is or is not cheating on arms control treaties by conducting nuclear tests in Novaya Zemla, and the state of the national missile defence project in America is unavoidably of interest to Russians.</p> <p>But there are other critical matters around. Intelligence chiefs might reply that, in addition to keeping an eye on each other, they have reorganised to focus on new dangers such as nuclear proliferation, other weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, environmental threats, and organised crime. There is no shortage of grand mission statements on these lines. The trouble here is that it is not evident that secret intelligence should be in a lead role across this whole spectrum, nor that it has so far delivered much of value. There is a consensus that governments need to be better at forecasting risk, identifying conflicts before they erupt, and trying to alleviate the conditions that give rise to conflict. But, if this ambition is to be fulfilled, it will be by a concerted effort by many organisations, inside and outside government.</p> <p>One of the ways intelligence services can best help is by sharing information, not something they find easy to do even when their governments are close allies. Policemen involved in the hunt for Balkan war criminals have described agonising sessions in which western intelligence agencies placed scraps of information on the table like poker players guarding their hands.

      "body": "<p>It would make a compelling opening scene for a spy movie. The head of the FBI, attending mass with his family on a typical Sunday morning at his local Catholic church. A few rows away another FBI agent, his wife and their six children, also regular worshippers at St Catherine of Siena. Elsewhere in the congregation, a Republican senator, an outspoken Supreme Court justice, and a former quarterback for the Washington Redskins. The Latin mass. Bach organ music. An eloquent priest whose weekly sermons enshrined an implacable view of what is right and wrong. Conservative America incarnate.</p> <p>Louis Freeh, the FBI director, and FBI special agent Robert Hanssen worshipped the same god in the same church. But the two men, it seems, served very different secular masters. For six years, Freeh has ruled the bureau with a rod of conservative iron that often riled the Clinton administration and made him a darling of the Republicans. But for 15 years, until he was arrested near his home in Virginia last month, Hanssen is said to have had spied for Russia.</p> <p>On Wednesday afternoon, after weeks of intense argument at the highest levels of George Bush's administration, the Americans unveiled a dramatic response to the 56-year-old family man's alleged treachery.</p> <p>The US secretary of state Colin Powell summoned the Russian ambassador in Washington, Yuri Ushakov, to his offices on the top floor of the state department. Curtly, Powell told Ushakov that the US was expelling six Russians said to have been directly involved with Hanssen. Two had already left, including the embassy press attache Vladimir Frolov. Four more were to leave within days. And Powell announced that Washington wanted another 46 other named Russian diplomats to pack their bags and leave by July 1.</p> <p>\"It was the right thing to do,\" Bush told reporters yesterday, making it clear that he was directly responsible for the move. \"I was presented with the facts. I made the decision. It was the right thing to do.\" In Moscow, Russian foreign minister Igor Ivanov has said the same number of American diplomats will be sent home.</p> <p>The American purge is easily the largest expulsion of alleged spies in the decade since the collapse of the Soviet Union. It posts a wide range of big questions about the Bush administration's attitude to Russia, about its foreign policy and about the future of US-Russian relations. But it is important to remember that the expulsions almost certainly would not have taken place had it not been for the Hanssen case, which appears on course to be easily the most significant case of treachery in the 90s.</p> <p>The scale of Hanssen's suspected betrayal is spectacular. Over 15 years he is said to have passed more than 6,000 pages of documents and 27 computer discs to his handlers from Moscow. A succession of immensely sensitive jobs made Hanssen a priceless espionage asset. He worked in FBI counter-intelligence for two thirds of the time he was spying for Moscow, while for five years he was the bureau's liaison man with the state department itself.</p> <p>Perhaps the most spectacular piece of information that Hanssen is said to have passed to his handlers was the fact that the Americans had dug a secret surveillance tunnel underneath the newly built Soviet embassy - now the Russian embassy - that was erected on a hill above Washington's Georgetown in the 1980s. The tunnel remained in active use until well into the 90s, ostensibly enabling the Americans to eavesdrop on secret Soviet and Russian conversations and communications. Now, however, it appears the Russians knew what was going on beneath their embassy all along.</p> <p>All this is classic secret-world stuff. Hanssen reportedly told his interrogators that he was led into spying through a fascination for the career of the British double agent Kim Philby. But while Philby and the spies of his generation took up treachery because of their ideological commitment to communism, Hanssen was allegedly in it for the money. He is accused of selling his secrets for an estimated $1.4m.</p> <p>Fifteen years ago, round about the time that Hanssen allegedly began his career as an agent, the Reagan administration threw out more than 80 Soviet diplomats in an action known as Operation Famish. But that was then. This is now. And it raises all kinds of questions, not just about the continuing secret conflict between Washington and Moscow, but about the world in which such espionage still thrives.</p> <p>Russian spying in the US and the west has \"increased dramatically\" in the past five years after a post-Soviet lull, according to Stranislav Lunev, a former spy who is the highest-ranking Russian defector ever to flee to the US. Its aim is \"the restoration of power and influence\", and above all, of industrial competitiveness, Lunev says. He estimates there were 450 Russian agents in the US before the new purge.</p> <p>\"If you are asking me whether this means we are going back to the cold war, then the answer is no,\" said Bill Clinton's former national security adviser, Tony Lake, yesterday. \"There's no Soviet Union. You could not recreate those times.\"</p> <p>Lake's response to the Bush administration's dramatic action was typical of the instant assessments being made elsewhere in the US and western Europe yesterday. In Moscow, Sergei Prikhodko, a foreign policy aide to President Vladimir Putin, may have condemned Washington's moves as a \"campaign of spy mania\" and as \"a fallback to the cold war epoch\", but the general response among foreign policy analysts is that the Bush administration is still shaping its strategy towards post-Soviet Russia.</p> <p>\"There is an instinct in every new administration to distinguish itself from the last,\" said Lake. \"But there is almost always a swing back to pragmatism as the realities of the world intrude. Just because we've elected a new American president, it doesn't mean that we've elected new American interests.\"</p> <p>In the cold war years when many of the officials around Bush cut their teeth as foreign policy specialists, the realities of the world were straightforward.

      "bodyText": "It would make a compelling opening scene for a spy movie. The head of the FBI, attending mass with his family on a typical Sunday morning at his local Catholic church. A few rows away another FBI agent, his wife and their six children, also regular worshippers at St Catherine of Siena. Elsewhere in the congregation, a Republican senator, an outspoken Supreme Court justice, and a former quarterback for the Washington Redskins. The Latin mass. Bach organ music. An eloquent priest whose weekly sermons enshrined an implacable view of what is right and wrong. Conservative America incarnate. Louis Freeh, the FBI director, and FBI special agent Robert Hanssen worshipped the same god in the same church. But the two men, it seems, served very different secular masters. For six years, Freeh has ruled the bureau with a rod of conservative iron that often riled the Clinton administration and made him a darling of the Republicans. But for 15 years, until he was arrested near his home in Virginia last month, Hanssen is said to have had spied for Russia. On Wednesday afternoon, after weeks of intense argument at the highest levels of George Bush's administration, the Americans unveiled a dramatic response to the 56-year-old family man's alleged treachery. The US secretary of state Colin Powell summoned the Russian ambassador in Washington, Yuri Ushakov, to his offices on the top floor of the state department. Curtly, Powell told Ushakov that the US was expelling six Russians said to have been directly involved with Hanssen. Two had already left, including the embassy press attache Vladimir Frolov. Four more were to leave within days. And Powell announced that Washington wanted another 46 other named Russian diplomats to pack their bags and leave by July 1. \"It was the right thing to do,\" Bush told reporters yesterday, making it clear that he was directly responsible for the move. \"I was presented with the facts. I made the decision. It was the right thing to do.\" In Moscow, Russian foreign minister Igor Ivanov has said the same number of American diplomats will be sent home. The American purge is easily the largest expulsion of alleged spies in the decade since the collapse of the Soviet Union. It posts a wide range of big questions about the Bush administration's attitude to Russia, about its foreign policy and about the future of US-Russian relations. But it is important to remember that the expulsions almost certainly would not have taken place had it not been for the Hanssen case, which appears on course to be easily the most significant case of treachery in the 90s. The scale of Hanssen's suspected betrayal is spectacular. Over 15 years he is said to have passed more than 6,000 pages of documents and 27 computer discs to his handlers from Moscow. A succession of immensely sensitive jobs made Hanssen a priceless espionage asset. He worked in FBI counter-intelligence for two thirds of the time he was spying for Moscow, while for five years he was the bureau's liaison man with the state department itself. Perhaps the most spectacular piece of information that Hanssen is said to have passed to his handlers was the fact that the Americans had dug a secret surveillance tunnel underneath the newly built Soviet embassy - now the Russian embassy - that was erected on a hill above Washington's Georgetown in the 1980s. The tunnel remained in active use until well into the 90s, ostensibly enabling the Americans to eavesdrop on secret Soviet and Russian conversations and communications. Now, however, it appears the Russians knew what was going on beneath their embassy all along. All this is classic secret-world stuff. Hanssen reportedly told his interrogators that he was led into spying through a fascination for the career of the British double agent Kim Philby. But while Philby and the spies of his generation took up treachery because of their ideological commitment to communism, Hanssen was allegedly in it for the money. He is accused of selling his secrets for an estimated $1.4m. Fifteen years ago, round about the time that Hanssen allegedly began his career as an agent, the Reagan administration threw out more than 80 Soviet diplomats in an action known as Operation Famish. But that was then. This is now. And it raises all kinds of questions, not just about the continuing secret conflict between Washington and Moscow, but about the world in which such espionage still thrives. Russian spying in the US and the west has \"increased dramatically\" in the past five years after a post-Soviet lull, according to Stranislav Lunev, a former spy who is the highest-ranking Russian defector ever to flee to the US. Its aim is \"the restoration of power and influence\", and above all, of industrial competitiveness, Lunev says. He estimates there were 450 Russian agents in the US before the new purge. \"If you are asking me whether this means we are going back to the cold war, then the answer is no,\" said Bill Clinton's former national security adviser, Tony Lake, yesterday. \"There's no Soviet Union. You could not recreate those times.\" Lake's response to the Bush administration's dramatic action was typical of the instant assessments being made elsewhere in the US and western Europe yesterday. In Moscow, Sergei Prikhodko, a foreign policy aide to President Vladimir Putin, may have condemned Washington's moves as a \"campaign of spy mania\" and as \"a fallback to the cold war epoch\", but the general response among foreign policy analysts is that the Bush administration is still shaping its strategy towards post-Soviet Russia. \"There is an instinct in every new administration to distinguish itself from the last,\" said Lake. \"But there is almost always a swing back to pragmatism as the realities of the world intrude. Just because we've elected a new American president, it doesn't mean that we've elected new American interests.\" In the cold war years when many of the officials around Bush cut their teeth as foreign policy specialists, the realities of the world were straightforward. There was a well-armed enemy, and everything was judged in the context of the struggle with communism. Today, the picture is far more fragmented and subtle. \"Many Russian futures are possible, ranging from political resurgence to dissolution,\" a Central Intelligence Agency assessment concluded late last year. \"The general drift, however, is toward authoritarianism, although not to the extreme extent of the Soviet period. Russia will focus its foreign policy goals on reestablishing lost influence in the former Soviet republics to the south, fostering ties to Europe and Asia, and presenting itself as a significant player vis-a-vis the United States.\" In the decade since the Soviet system collapsed, US-Russia relations have suffered far more setbacks than the confident mood at the start of the decade suggested.

Rice's hand can be seen behind this week's expulsions. One thing, though, is already clear about the Bush administration's approach to the new Russia.

He said any damages awarded Mr Costello would probably not be large because the car was \"a shell\".</p> <p>The case illustrates the old legal maxim that \"possession is nine points of the law\". The rule is that the person in possession of goods is deemed to be entitled to them unless someone with a better claim to them comes forward.</p> <p>The owner of the Ford Fiesta could not be traced because the car's identification number had been obliterated and a new one welded on, and its engine number had been ground off.</p> <p>\"Possession is entitled to the same legal protection whether or not it has been obtained lawfully or by theft or other unlawful means,\" said Mr Justice Lightman after a review of previous court decisions.</p> <p>\"It vests in the possessor a possessory title which is good against the world, save against anyone claiming under a better title,\" said the judge, sitting with lords justices Robert Walker and Keene.</p> <p>Earlier cases include one in which money was found in the public part of a jeweller's shop and another in which a bracelet was picked up at Heathrow airport. When the true owners failed to come forward, the finders were allowed to keep the goods.</p> <p>Seeking permission to appeal against the decision to the Lords, Fiona Barton, for the chief constable of Derbyshire, said the judgment placed the police in real difficulty. It meant that it was in the interests of thieves and handlers to obliterate the identity numbers of stolen items so they could claim the goods back in the absence of the true owner.</p> <p>Lord Justice Walker said the court was \"not wholly unsympathetic\" with police concerns.

      "bodyText": "Police hope to appeal against a ruling yesterday that a \"highly suspect\" driver arrested in possession of a stolen car was entitled to have it returned to him, plus damages for its wrongful detention by police since 1997. In what Derbyshire police say amounts to a \"thieves' charter,\" three judges ruled that because the car's identity had been changed it was impossible to trace the legal owner and therefore the person found in possession of it was entitled to keep it. The three judges backed an appeal by Jason Costello against a decision by Derby county court not to return the car to him on the grounds that he knew it was stolen. A spokesman for Derbyshire police said the force would be meeting next week to discuss an appeal. He said any damages awarded Mr Costello would probably not be large because the car was \"a shell\". The case illustrates the old legal maxim that \"possession is nine points of the law\". The rule is that the person in possession of goods is deemed to be entitled to them unless someone with a better claim to them comes forward. The owner of the Ford Fiesta could not be traced because the car's identification number had been obliterated and a new one welded on, and its engine number had been ground off. \"Possession is entitled to the same legal protection whether or not it has been obtained lawfully or by theft or other unlawful means,\" said Mr Justice Lightman after a review of previous court decisions. \"It vests in the possessor a possessory title which is good against the world, save against anyone claiming under a better title,\" said the judge, sitting with lords justices Robert Walker and Keene. Earlier cases include one in which money was found in the public part of a jeweller's shop and another in which a bracelet was picked up at Heathrow airport. When the true owners failed to come forward, the finders were allowed to keep the goods. Seeking permission to appeal against the decision to the Lords, Fiona Barton, for the chief constable of Derbyshire, said the judgment placed the police in real difficulty. It meant that it was in the interests of thieves and handlers to obliterate the identity numbers of stolen items so they could claim the goods back in the absence of the true owner. Lord Justice Walker said the court was \"not wholly unsympathetic\" with police concerns. But the judges refused permission to appeal, leaving it to the police to ask the law lords themselves whether they will allow an appeal. Mr Costello was stopped after a short chase in Derby and another man in the car was arrested and later convicted of stealing a different vehicle. Mr Costello was never charged. Police retained the car under the 1984 Police and Criminal Evidence Act. A \"ringing\" kit - used to \"ring the changes\" in a car's identity - was found under the back seat. Mr Costello claimed there could have been an honest and innocent explanation for the number changes - such as a change of body shell or engine - but the Derby county court judge who originally dismissed his claim to have the car returned in 1999 held that the car was stolen and that Mr Costello knew this. Mr Justice Lightman said the judge had been fully entitled to reach that conclusion. Mr Costello's behaviour when the car was seized was, at its lowest, \"highly suspicious\", and he gave false evidence to the county court. But the 1984 act gave police only a temporary right to retain goods for the purposes of a criminal investigation, for use as evidence at a trial or to establish lawful ownership. The limited right of the police to retain property and their obligation to return it to the \"owner\" after completing their inquiries were \"unaffected by any perceived public policy consideration that the fruits of his criminal activities ought to be withheld from a criminal\", said the judge. This conclusion was in accord with a principle\"that even a thief is entitled to the protection of the criminal law against the theft from him of that which he has stolen\". The judges ruled that damages should be assessed by the county court.",

      "bodyText": "Politicians in Pakistan vowed last night to go ahead with a large protest rally today despite the arrests of hundreds of party workers by the military regime. In the biggest crackdown on political activity since the military took power in October 1999, troops this week rounded up 1,600 activists including 28 senior politicians ahead of the planned gathering. Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan, who leads a broad opposition movement, the Alliance for the Restoration of Democracy, said the protest would go ahead despite the mass detentions. \"We believe in non-violence and have always demonstrated for the restoration of democracy,\" said Mr Khan, who was himself briefly arrested on Wednesday. \"To ban this kind of peaceful political activity does not inspire confidence among the people.\" Few people expected the rally, to be held at Mochi Gate in Lahore, a traditional site of protest during British rule, to attract large crowds and international attention. The protest was timed to coincide with Pakistan Day, when the military parades tanks, heavy artillery and missiles through the streets of Islamabad to commemorate the day in 1940 when Muslim politicians in India decided to work for a separate Islamic homeland. But now the sudden military crackdown has brought the regime under renewed pressure to explain how exactly it intends to return Pakistan to democracy by October next year in line with a supreme court ruling. The military has already banned public political meetings and has come down hard on any attempts to lead mass protest rallies, apparently concerned that it could appear weak. \"The government says this kind of political activity detracts from the agenda,\" said Rifaat Hussain, a political scientist at Quaid-i-Azam University in Islamabad. \"When the military is in charge weakness in law and order doesn't go down well for their image.\" Last July Kulsoom Sharif, the wife of the deposed prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, was detained for 10 hours and her car towed away while she sat inside after she tried to lead a similar anti-government rally. The arrests overshadowed the second round of voting on Wednesday in local elections, the first to be held in Pakistan since 1987. In staggered polls, which run until August, Pakistanis will be able to elect local councillors who will have unprecedented powers under reforms by the military.",

After reversing into an inspection bay, Wacker said that he helped the officers open one of the doors, which was stiff.</p> <p>The court has heard the 58 bodies and two survivors, were found behind a screen of tomato pallettes, allegedly installed to conceal the real cargo.</p> <p>\"Were you concerned about what they might find?\" asked Mr Lawson. \"No.\"</p> <p>\"Did you know what the lorry contained?\"</p> <p>\"No. When a load is sealed you can't check the load itself. All you can do is check the seal mark.\"</p> <p>Wacker told the court he was unconcerned when he was stopped because it had happened 25 or 26 times before. He said he was surprised when a customs officer climbed a ladder at the rear of the trailer and started looking for people inside the container.</p> <p>Wacker said that the first he knew of his real cargo was when he was arrested and charged with murder - later reduced to manslaughter - and people trafficking.</p> <p>\"They [the police and customs] told me they found people in the back of the lorry ...

      "bodyText": "A Dutch driver who arrived at Dover with 58 dead Chinese illegal immigrants in his lorry yesterday denied knowing they were on board. Perry Wacker, 33, told a jury at Maidstone crown court that the discovery of the bodies had left him speechless. Under questioning from his counsel, Michael Lawson QC, Wacker said in English that he had not seen the lorry loaded and, having examined the documentation, believed he was transporting tomatoes to Bristol. He was stopped at Dover by customs officers around midnight on June 18. After reversing into an inspection bay, Wacker said that he helped the officers open one of the doors, which was stiff. The court has heard the 58 bodies and two survivors, were found behind a screen of tomato pallettes, allegedly installed to conceal the real cargo. \"Were you concerned about what they might find?\" asked Mr Lawson. \"No.\" \"Did you know what the lorry contained?\" \"No. When a load is sealed you can't check the load itself. All you can do is check the seal mark.\" Wacker told the court he was unconcerned when he was stopped because it had happened 25 or 26 times before. He said he was surprised when a customs officer climbed a ladder at the rear of the trailer and started looking for people inside the container. Wacker said that the first he knew of his real cargo was when he was arrested and charged with murder - later reduced to manslaughter - and people trafficking. \"They [the police and customs] told me they found people in the back of the lorry ... I had no words, none at all. It was a heavy impact,\" he said. Wacker said he had collected the lorry at 3pm that day from an industrial estate in Waalhaven in Rotterdam docks. Accompanied by his friend, Leo Nijveen, Wacker had found the keys under the bumper, and in a toolbox he found a mobile phone, the seal mark documentation which indicated the load was tomatoes, a map, and cash for the trip. The court heard that Wacker was engaged to drive the lorry to the UK after a chance meeting with a friend, Wilhelm Jansen, a week before the fatal journey. Wacker told Jansen he was out of work and Jansen said he might be able to help. Jansen introduced Wacker to a Mr Van Der Speck, who said he was starting a lorry company and that he would like Wacker to drive for him. Wacker said he had known Nijveen, also a lorry driver, since 1995 and that they had driven for a company owned by Wacker's uncle, Ronald. In April last year Nyveen had been stopped at Dover driving a vehicle for Ronald Wacker, and 50 Chinese had been found in the back. Nyveen was fined \u00a3100,000. Wacker acknowledged he knew about this, but said that his friend did not tell him how the Chinese came to be in the back of the lorry. He revealed he had a criminal record for theft and insurance and welfare fraud. Wacker denies 58 charges of manslaughter and four of conspiracy to facilitate the entry of illegal immigrants. Ying Guo 29, a translator from South Woodford, London, denies conspiracy to facilitate illegal entry.",

One month after the overthrow of Mr Milosevic last October, the Bank of England, in line with the rest of the EU, lifted most of the economic sanctions against Yugoslavia; it did not lift those placed on suspected Milosevic family assets and the accounts of indicted war criminals. Last night a Bank of England spokeswoman declined to say whether any bank accounts belonging to Yugoslavs in Britain were monitored or frozen. Yugoslav assets worth more than $200m (\u00a3140m) are still frozen in the US. Cyprus, long the hub for the regime's financial wheeler-dealing, has recently provided Mr Dinkic with some information. It has also transferred crates of documents on the regime's financial scheming to the international war crimes tribunal in the Hague. About $38m (\u00a327m) has been frozen in Swiss bank accounts, including the personal accounts of 35 Yugoslav citizens. Investigators have failed to turn up any evidence that Mr Milosevic himself has secret bank accounts abroad, but Mr Dinkic returned from Cyprus last week declaring that he had discovered the details of a secret account belonging to a close relative of the indicted war criminal. Mr Dinkic appears frustrated that there has been no concerted international effort to trace the missing money. Senior government officials in Belgrade complain that, in contrast to Germany, France, or Italy, Britain is being less than helpful to the new Serbian and Yugoslav governments. Mr Dinkic estimates that there may be as much as $4bn ($2.8bn) missing from the Milosevic era. It is clear that the bulk of that money did not go towards enriching individuals in the regime; rather it is thought to have funded some elaborate sanctions-busting schemes throughout the 90s which kept Yugoslavia trading, despite the economic embargo. Nonetheless, it is thought that hundreds of millions of dollars have been purloined into private accounts abroad. Mr Dinkic is expected to arrive at the Bank of England today with specific requests for information on bank accounts, perhaps supplied to him by the US Treasury's office for foreign assets control, which has been tracking the sophisticated global currency operations and transactions of the Milosevic inner circle for years. British officials say they are in the dark as to the specifics of Mr Dinkic's interest in accounts in Britain. A well-placed source in Belgrade, however, said assets worth tens of millions of pounds were frozen in Britain in the mid-90s as a result of the UN sanctions imposed on Yugoslavia because of the Kosovo war. Those sanctions were lifted in 1996, but financial sanctions were reapplied in 1998, when Mr Milosevic launched his campaign in Kosovo. Given the prominence of the City of London in international finance, experts do not doubt that ample volumes of Yugoslav money moved through Britain in the 90s. But London is not believed to have been a major centre for the regime's operations.",

A spokesman said the company had not changed its policy on severance pay for more than a year. He refused to elaborate. </p> <p>Whitbread this week agreed to sell its pubs and bars to Morgan Grenfell Private Equity, which wants to convert all the outlets to arms-length tenancies, with likely job losses among salaried pub managers. </p> <p>Several hundred tenants want to buy their own pubs but Whitbread has refused, saying individual sales would be expensive and time-consuming. </p> <p>A letter leaked to the Guardian yesterday reveals that the company took a different view in 1991. The letter, from field operations director PJ Carter, advises the landlord of the Old Coach House in Canterbury that his pub is to be put on the market. </p> <p>Inviting the landlord to make a bid, Mr Carter wrote: \"It is our usual practice to offer the existing licensee the first opportunity to purchase the house.\" </p> <p>Former Whitbread chairman Sir Charles Tidbury has expressed support for the publicans' campaign to buy their own houses, as has Labour MEP Brian Simpson.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Whitbread was accused of being cheap and disloyal by a trade union yesterday, following claims that the leisure group had changed its policy on redundancy payouts shortly before selling its 3,000-strong pub estate. Pressure on the company to offer its tenants the right to buy their pubs increased with the release of a 1991 letter from management describing this as Whitbread's \"usual practice\". The National Association of Licensed House Managers alleged that the company recently reduced pub managers' entitlement to severance pay for the first time in 20 years. Peter Love, the union's national officer, said: \"This company had a redundancy severance policy which went back as far as 1981.\" He said the association, which is part of the Transport &amp; General Workers' Union, was told by Whitbread just over a month ago that this policy was no longer in force: \"Without any consultation with ourselves or with managers, they've changed the policy to something which is not as generous.\" This was disputed by Whitbread, which described the allegation as outrageous. A spokesman said the company had not changed its policy on severance pay for more than a year. He refused to elaborate. Whitbread this week agreed to sell its pubs and bars to Morgan Grenfell Private Equity, which wants to convert all the outlets to arms-length tenancies, with likely job losses among salaried pub managers. Several hundred tenants want to buy their own pubs but Whitbread has refused, saying individual sales would be expensive and time-consuming. A letter leaked to the Guardian yesterday reveals that the company took a different view in 1991. The letter, from field operations director PJ Carter, advises the landlord of the Old Coach House in Canterbury that his pub is to be put on the market. Inviting the landlord to make a bid, Mr Carter wrote: \"It is our usual practice to offer the existing licensee the first opportunity to purchase the house.\" Former Whitbread chairman Sir Charles Tidbury has expressed support for the publicans' campaign to buy their own houses, as has Labour MEP Brian Simpson.",

      "body": "<p>Technology stocks may generally be in free fall without a parachute, but a few in niche segments, maintain propulsion. Take Cobham, a defence and aerospace group which yesterday proved the adage: in a bear market turn to the military. </p> <p>Cobham's stock rose 2.5% on the back of a 24.2% rise in pretax profits for 2000 to \u00a390.2m - and, critically, the prospect of future earnings growth from stakes in potentially lucrative projects. </p> <p>Gordon Page, chief executive, could also point to a war chest worth several hundred millions to finance acquisitions out of own resources and without damaging the company's cash-generative performance. </p> <p>Cobham has positioned itself as a relatively small but key player in some of the most vital civil and military aerospace projects, with a record \u00a31.3bn order book. </p> <p>\"We are well-placed in technologies which are required even though there's pressure on defence budgets,\" Mr Page said. Cobham has more than \u00a3750,000 of equipment on each of the 600-plus Eurofighters being built, with hopes that Greece will buy a further 90. </p> <p>George Bush may have called in the Joint Strike Fighter programme for review but Mr Page is confident it will be built and that Cobham technology will be present with its fuelling systems. And US military spending - Cobham's biggest market - will rise. </p> <p>The company has joined up with French group Thales, pan-European group EADS, Rolls-Royce et al to bid against a BAE Systems-led consortium for the \u00a313bn RAF in-flight refuelling tanker service. </p> <p>Airbus is due to choose the supplier of fuel and oxygen systems for its A380 superjumbo, with Cobham again in the frame. It all enables Mr Page, due to step up to chairman, to say: \"We wish to remain independent and see long-term growth; if anyone wants to buy in they will have to do so with a vengeance.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Technology stocks may generally be in free fall without a parachute, but a few in niche segments, maintain propulsion. Take Cobham, a defence and aerospace group which yesterday proved the adage: in a bear market turn to the military. Cobham's stock rose 2.5% on the back of a 24.2% rise in pretax profits for 2000 to \u00a390.2m - and, critically, the prospect of future earnings growth from stakes in potentially lucrative projects. Gordon Page, chief executive, could also point to a war chest worth several hundred millions to finance acquisitions out of own resources and without damaging the company's cash-generative performance. Cobham has positioned itself as a relatively small but key player in some of the most vital civil and military aerospace projects, with a record \u00a31.3bn order book. \"We are well-placed in technologies which are required even though there's pressure on defence budgets,\" Mr Page said. Cobham has more than \u00a3750,000 of equipment on each of the 600-plus Eurofighters being built, with hopes that Greece will buy a further 90. George Bush may have called in the Joint Strike Fighter programme for review but Mr Page is confident it will be built and that Cobham technology will be present with its fuelling systems. And US military spending - Cobham's biggest market - will rise. The company has joined up with French group Thales, pan-European group EADS, Rolls-Royce et al to bid against a BAE Systems-led consortium for the \u00a313bn RAF in-flight refuelling tanker service. Airbus is due to choose the supplier of fuel and oxygen systems for its A380 superjumbo, with Cobham again in the frame. It all enables Mr Page, due to step up to chairman, to say: \"We wish to remain independent and see long-term growth; if anyone wants to buy in they will have to do so with a vengeance.\"",

Psychologists and politicians fear that the increase in the number of children who apparently kill for kicks is a sign that the strong moral bonds of Spain's traditionally tight-knit families and close communities are beginning togive way. \"I think we are, in some way, all to blame,\" Clara's father, Jose Antonio Garcia, said. Figures show that the number of murders, many of them similarly brutal and motiveless, carried out by under-18s has increased by 60% in the past six years. The killers had collected press clippings about recent murders in Spain, especially those committed by young people. They had also written a fan letter to a 16-year-old from Murcia, south-east Spain, who last year used a samurai sword to hack to death his parents and his 11-year-old sister, who had Down's syndrome. The youth, who will appear in court soon, has admitted his crime but has also shown no remorse for what police said was a brutal and carefully-planned, night-time attack. \"The cause of juvenile violence is a society which educates children as to their rights but not as to their obligations,\" said a forensic psychologist, Javier Urra. \"Society has lost its moral strength.\"",

      "bodyText": "East Germany's last communist leader, Egon Krenz, yesterday saw his controversial attempt to claim that he was not responsible for the death of four people shot trying to scale the Berlin Wall quashed once and for all. The judgment was greeted in some quarters as a message to the world's dictators that they cannot pay lip service to human rights while simultaneously abusing them, and that they will be held to account by successor governments. Others claimed, however, that the ruling set a utopian precedent that would be impossible to enforce and which, if properly applied, would see Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, dragged before the European Court of Human Rights for atrocities allegedly committed by his troops in Chechnya. The Strasbourg court unanimously rejected Krenz's appeal against a manslaughter verdict handed out by a German court after reunification. Krenz, 63, will now have to serve the remainder of his six-and-a-half year prison sentence. Together with two former senior members of the country's politburo and a border guard, he had tried to argue that stopping people fleeing the now defunct communist state using \"proportionate force\" was perfectly legal under East German law. It would be unreasonable, they claimed, to convict them retrospectively under today's federal laws. But the court cleverly skirted the murky legal waters of whether federal German law supersedes East German law when the 17 judges ruled that the behaviour of Krenz and his two subordinates was illegal under the German Democratic Republic's (GDR) laws anyway. It was true, the court said, that the GDR had a policy of protecting its border \"at all costs\", but the need to preserve human life was also enshrined in the country's constitution, and that was more important. \"Because of the very senior positions they occupied in the state apparatus, they evidently could not have been ignorant of [East Germany's] constitution and legislation, or of its international obligations and the criticisms of its border-policing regime that had been made internationally.\" But Piers Gardner, the British barrister representing the four defendants, argued that the court's finding that shooting people on the wall was unlawful under East German law was questionable. \"It is difficult to agree that the law of the GDR was as the court found it,\" he said. \"This judgment should make everyone think from here to Vladivostock.\" More than 200 people are estimated to have been shot while trying to clamber over the Berlin Wall during the cold war. Prosecutors argued that Krenz, as a leading politburo member responsible for security issues from 1983, was directly responsible. A defiant Krenz disdainfully dismissed yesterday's ruling: \"They took the West German historic point of view rather than the legal reality.\" \"For me, it will be interesting how the German government deals with the politicians from Russia who had responsibility for the Soviet Union. There my military commander was [Mikhail] Gorbachev.\" The victims' families took a different view of the judgment. \"It is a relief and a huge weight off my shoulders,\" said Karin Gueffroy, whose son was gunned down as he and a friend tried to scale the wall in 1989. Krenz \"understood nothing\", she said. One legal source said last night, however, that the ruling had damaged the court's credibility and set a precedent that could not be followed. If Krenz, a former politician, can be charged with man- slaughter, the source argued, then so can the prime minister at the time of the Bloody Sunday massacre and politicians from Russia to Ukraine. And that, he said, simply is not going to happen.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It was on the eve of his 300th operation that Danny Bond decided he wanted to die. The 20-year-old's chest looked like an Ordnance Survey map: a collision of scars drawn from 18 colostomies, 19 ileostomies, 150 septicaemic infections, a dozen haemorrhages and the sharp contours of malnutrition - a summary of Danny's life in ward E7 of Southampton general hospital. His mother Beverley, a nurse, held his hand over the rim of the bed. \"I've had enough, mum,\" he said, and she nodded.</p> <p>A fortnight ago, Danny submitted to his 301st operation, a procedure to untwist his bowel. He is suffering from a rare condition called chronic pseudo obstruct, which prevents the nerves between the brain and the digestive system communicating. When Danny tries to digest, his brain tells his gut to clench then forgets to release it. The result is permanent obstruction: he is attached to a feeding machine 10 hours a day, has had the pain in his gut likened by doctors to childbirth and has never been able to empty his bowel. For now, however, Danny's decision to refuse further treatment has been suspended.</p> <p>Since appearing on a BBC2 documentary last month, Danny has been flooded with letters praising his courage and urging him to seek treatment from a pioneering American bowel specialist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. \"It's $5,000 just to sit on Dr Camilleri's couch,\" says Danny's mother. Before he gives up, her son would like to exhaust this final possibility.</p> <p>While the money is being raised, Danny must undergo the sickening routine of more surgery. In a side room of Southampton hospital's west wing, he awaits the latest round with mounting distress. \"How are you with vomit?\" his mum asks brightly, and explains that Danny has become so terrified of the operating table that he starts throwing up 12 hours before surgery and doesn't stop until he has been knocked out.</p> <p>\"Hello,\" he whispers, lifting an eyelid and shutting it again. He is the colour of milk, protecting himself in these hours before surgery by withdrawing from the world and letting Beverley speak, largely, for him. Even at his weakest, however, he manages to communicate a healthy intolerance of his mother. \"I like sport,\" he croaks, when asked about his interests. \"I'm good at all of them.\" \"He's a natural mimic,\" interjects Beverley, \"so if he sees someone swing a golf cue, he's got the rhythm straight off.\"</p> <p>Under his lids, Danny's eyes roll. \"Golf club, not cue,\" he corrects, witheringly.</p> <p>Danny Bond was born 20 years ago, 12 weeks prematurely, and had to be resuscitated immediately. He is the second of Beverley Dodds's three children, the eldest of whom, a 23-year-old daughter, is presently three beds down from Danny with suspected appendicitis. His stepfather, Mike, is a hostage negotiator with the police force. After Danny was ventilated and placed in a special baby unit, he had a haemorrhage and developed an infection in his bowel lining. At five weeks, he underwent heart surgery. Since then, he has never spent more than a couple of months out of hospital and has only celebrated two birthdays and two Christmases at home.</p> <p>The biggest problem for Danny's family was that until the age of 12, nobody knew what was wrong with him. \"We were told he was anorexic,\" says Beverley. \"We were told it was all in his head - or in my head. They sent him to a residential home to get him away from mother for a week, as if it were a nervous disorder.\" At one stage, Danny had 21 exploratory operations in six months. \"In the end we said, if this is in his head then he's very good at it, seeing as whenever you open him up his guts are all twisted.\"</p> <p>At 11, Danny's weight plummeted to two stones and he was admitted to Great Ormond Street hospital, where he was finally diagnosed with chronic pseudo obstruct.</p> <p>The pain that followed was unimaginable. \"Have you ever seen [the film] Alien?\" he asks. \"It's like one of these little creatures inside your stomach trying to pop out.\"</p> <p>The disruptions ruled out regular school and although there was a school in the hospital, he was always too ill to attend. When he won a place at a higher education college, he was only there for 11 weeks and had to forfeit his tuition fees. The strength of the drugs he was on made his mind cloudy and unfit for exams.</p> <p>Worst of all, says his family, was the psychological damage done by wave after wave of frustrated expectations. \"Every time you meet a new surgeon they always say: 'I've got a knack, I've got this way you've never had before, it will work,' \" says Beverley. \"This is what he hates, don't you Dan? We now say to them, don't do that. Just be honest. Because every time they say it, a little bit of you hopes they're right, and then you feel let down and betrayed.\"</p> <p>The two disagree over just how many operations he has had. Only including the major procedures, Beverley has counted 300, mention of which makes Danny grimace and exhale loudly. \"Dan thinks it's in the 500s, don't you? But we've stopped counting the nips and tucks.\" Three years ago, Danny contracted the penicillin-resistant superbug, MRSA, which raised the tally of operations by repeatedly infecting the line in his chest.</p> <p>The constant in all this turmoil has been Beverley's good humour: while Danny is unwell, she is ferociously upbeat for him, so utterly in his corner that, she says, his siblings have all felt jealous, then they feel guilty for feeling jealous.</p> <p>The minute Danny enters one of his short-lived periods of stability, Beverley and her husband deflate. \"Dad and I keep on going day in, day out and when he has a couple of weeks of feeling better, we go to pieces. It's during the quiet times that your brain has time to think.\"</p> <p>During a quiet time two months ago, Beverley thought Danny had come to the end of the line. Nerve damage was making his operations increasingly painful and the more disheartened he grew, the less able he was to cope. His bones hurt, his muscles hurt, he became clinically depressed.</p> <p>Twice, he gained access to the pill box and tried to commit suicide. \"There are times when you just sit there and don't know what to say or think,\" his mother says. \"There are times when you wonder if you should put a pillow over his head.

      "bodyText": "It was on the eve of his 300th operation that Danny Bond decided he wanted to die. The 20-year-old's chest looked like an Ordnance Survey map: a collision of scars drawn from 18 colostomies, 19 ileostomies, 150 septicaemic infections, a dozen haemorrhages and the sharp contours of malnutrition - a summary of Danny's life in ward E7 of Southampton general hospital. His mother Beverley, a nurse, held his hand over the rim of the bed. \"I've had enough, mum,\" he said, and she nodded. A fortnight ago, Danny submitted to his 301st operation, a procedure to untwist his bowel. He is suffering from a rare condition called chronic pseudo obstruct, which prevents the nerves between the brain and the digestive system communicating. When Danny tries to digest, his brain tells his gut to clench then forgets to release it. The result is permanent obstruction: he is attached to a feeding machine 10 hours a day, has had the pain in his gut likened by doctors to childbirth and has never been able to empty his bowel. For now, however, Danny's decision to refuse further treatment has been suspended. Since appearing on a BBC2 documentary last month, Danny has been flooded with letters praising his courage and urging him to seek treatment from a pioneering American bowel specialist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. \"It's $5,000 just to sit on Dr Camilleri's couch,\" says Danny's mother. Before he gives up, her son would like to exhaust this final possibility. While the money is being raised, Danny must undergo the sickening routine of more surgery. In a side room of Southampton hospital's west wing, he awaits the latest round with mounting distress. \"How are you with vomit?\" his mum asks brightly, and explains that Danny has become so terrified of the operating table that he starts throwing up 12 hours before surgery and doesn't stop until he has been knocked out. \"Hello,\" he whispers, lifting an eyelid and shutting it again. He is the colour of milk, protecting himself in these hours before surgery by withdrawing from the world and letting Beverley speak, largely, for him. Even at his weakest, however, he manages to communicate a healthy intolerance of his mother. \"I like sport,\" he croaks, when asked about his interests. \"I'm good at all of them.\" \"He's a natural mimic,\" interjects Beverley, \"so if he sees someone swing a golf cue, he's got the rhythm straight off.\" Under his lids, Danny's eyes roll. \"Golf club, not cue,\" he corrects, witheringly. Danny Bond was born 20 years ago, 12 weeks prematurely, and had to be resuscitated immediately. He is the second of Beverley Dodds's three children, the eldest of whom, a 23-year-old daughter, is presently three beds down from Danny with suspected appendicitis. His stepfather, Mike, is a hostage negotiator with the police force. After Danny was ventilated and placed in a special baby unit, he had a haemorrhage and developed an infection in his bowel lining. At five weeks, he underwent heart surgery. Since then, he has never spent more than a couple of months out of hospital and has only celebrated two birthdays and two Christmases at home. The biggest problem for Danny's family was that until the age of 12, nobody knew what was wrong with him. \"We were told he was anorexic,\" says Beverley. \"We were told it was all in his head - or in my head. They sent him to a residential home to get him away from mother for a week, as if it were a nervous disorder.\" At one stage, Danny had 21 exploratory operations in six months. \"In the end we said, if this is in his head then he's very good at it, seeing as whenever you open him up his guts are all twisted.\" At 11, Danny's weight plummeted to two stones and he was admitted to Great Ormond Street hospital, where he was finally diagnosed with chronic pseudo obstruct. The pain that followed was unimaginable. \"Have you ever seen [the film] Alien?\" he asks. \"It's like one of these little creatures inside your stomach trying to pop out.\" The disruptions ruled out regular school and although there was a school in the hospital, he was always too ill to attend. When he won a place at a higher education college, he was only there for 11 weeks and had to forfeit his tuition fees. The strength of the drugs he was on made his mind cloudy and unfit for exams. Worst of all, says his family, was the psychological damage done by wave after wave of frustrated expectations. \"Every time you meet a new surgeon they always say: 'I've got a knack, I've got this way you've never had before, it will work,' \" says Beverley. \"This is what he hates, don't you Dan? We now say to them, don't do that. Just be honest. Because every time they say it, a little bit of you hopes they're right, and then you feel let down and betrayed.\" The two disagree over just how many operations he has had. Only including the major procedures, Beverley has counted 300, mention of which makes Danny grimace and exhale loudly. \"Dan thinks it's in the 500s, don't you? But we've stopped counting the nips and tucks.\" Three years ago, Danny contracted the penicillin-resistant superbug, MRSA, which raised the tally of operations by repeatedly infecting the line in his chest. The constant in all this turmoil has been Beverley's good humour: while Danny is unwell, she is ferociously upbeat for him, so utterly in his corner that, she says, his siblings have all felt jealous, then they feel guilty for feeling jealous. The minute Danny enters one of his short-lived periods of stability, Beverley and her husband deflate. \"Dad and I keep on going day in, day out and when he has a couple of weeks of feeling better, we go to pieces. It's during the quiet times that your brain has time to think.\" During a quiet time two months ago, Beverley thought Danny had come to the end of the line. Nerve damage was making his operations increasingly painful and the more disheartened he grew, the less able he was to cope. His bones hurt, his muscles hurt, he became clinically depressed. Twice, he gained access to the pill box and tried to commit suicide. \"There are times when you just sit there and don't know what to say or think,\" his mother says. \"There are times when you wonder if you should put a pillow over his head. Then you take a deep breath and cope with the next onslaught.\" Eventually, Danny told his family he didn't want to have any more surgery. They supported him, a decision for which they expected to be vilified. On the night that the documentary was screened, they left the house. As it turned out, the family didn't get one crank letter. Someone sent Danny some cut-outs of the Virgin Mary, but he reckoned they couldn't do him any harm. As the encouragement rolled in, something in his outlook began to change. \"He said that the response from the public made him feel like there was some hope out there. There are so many nice people rooting for him that maybe it wasn't time to give up.\" He still has the pain and the utter boredom to deal with - Danny's main diversion is a Playstation 2 - but during the worst periods he retreats into the memory of his only three months of normal life. When he was 17, Danny rallied enough to live on his own in a flat he rented from his aunt. \"Parties, late nights, no parents. You were wild, weren't you Dan?\" He smiles, weakly. \u0095 To make donations to the charity Danny's Decision, visit any branch of Lloyds TSB and quote account number 00501249.",

After I found this out from his mobile phone bill, he admitted that he has used them since he was a teenager. He also said that it is a gender thing - men need cheap thrills. We're in our late 20s and I'm an attractive woman who loves sex. Why am I not enough? I made him understand how I felt about him calling these lines by describing myself getting off on what a man might say to me on a sex line.

I need some honest answers from both men and women - must I just get used to it?</b> <p><b> Consider counselling</b><br> </p> <p> Your partner's problem is neither a universal fact nor something you have to get used to. There are two separate issues here: his behaviour and your feelings about it. You feel diminished by your discovery; you should not. This is not about you or your desirability; it is rooted in your partner's behaviour. Decide what it is about this issue that upsets you: discovery or exclusion. In my own life it was not the discovery that upset me, it was the time devoted by my partner to something which is merely a fantasy. Your partner probably finds it impossible to discuss his true feelings with you. </p> <p>This predates your relationship and, although many people find this subject difficult, he is avoiding it completely. Since he feels secure with phone sex, perhaps he could call you instead of a stranger. </p> <p>The disgust your partner displayed at your description of role reversal is an indication of his intimidation by real sex. If you cannot accommodate this in your relationship, I recommend that you obtain counselling. Do not postpone acting, nor allow your partner to. My partner claimed it was \"a phase\" and that she did not require help to resolve it. It has all but ended our relationship. Sex is the glue that bonds people. You only come unstuck if you want to. <br><b>Name and address withheld </b></p> <p><b> Uncover his fantasies</b><br> </p> <p> What sort of idiot is this guy? Does he have nothing better to do with his money than waste it talking to strangers? Is he not brave enough to tell you what it is that he wants? Telling you what he likes, fantasises about, is the best thing he could do. It opens up so many possibilities and would certainly be more interesting than listening to some remote \"sex goddess\" babble on about some nonsense that she has told so many other blokes, it has become an utterly boring, non-interactive experience for her. </p> <p>If he's not willing to tell you what goes on in his head, get rid of him.<br><b>Name and address withheld </b></p> <p><b> Men are not all like him</b><br> </p> <p> No, all men do not need cheap sexual thrills. All men do not use chat lines or similar forms of stimulation. Most men perhaps succumb to their curiosity about such things occasionally. Most men want their partner to be the primary focus of their sexual interest. Their minds will wander - some will be unfaithful - but the ambition at heart is to have a relationship where the sex is good and intrinsic to how well they get on. </p> <p>He defends his use of sex lines by making generalisations which he must know aren't true. Would he tell his male friends he uses chat lines? I doubt it. But if all men needed cheap thrills, they would be the first to understand, wouldn't they? </p> <p>Most men, if in a good relationship, masturbate as a corollary to the relationship. Many fantasise about their own partners. All relationships have fallow periods of sexual interest. Sometimes it is less fuss to nip into the spare room for a quick yank of nature's stress reliever. <br><b>John O'Halloram, Belfast </b></p> <p><b> Turn the tables</b><br> </p> <p> A man I knew bought porn mags regularly, which caused immense distress to his wife. Whenever she expressed her unhappiness he would say: \"Don't be like that. It's only a bit of harmless fun. All the chaps at the office do it.\" </p> <p>One night hubby got home and found his wife ogling photos of naked men with enormous penises and licking her lips. Hubby was absolutely devastated. \"Don't be like that,\" she said, \"It's only a bit of harmless fun. All the girls at the office do it.\" That put an end to his top-shelf purchases. </p> <p>Try similar tactics with sex lines. Tell your partner you are sorry you made such a fuss about his sex lines, that they are terrific fun and that you understand fully why he finds them so addictive. When forced to confront the reality of his actions he will probably mend his ways. If not, a young, attractive and sexy woman like you should have no problem finding a replacement.<br><b>Claude Shields, Bucks </b></p> <p> <b> Next week </b><br> </p> <p>I can't decide whether to divorce. I'm 45, have been married for 20 years and have children of 16,13 and five. I care for but don't love my husband - as he has aged he has become miserable and pedantic. I think it's partly genetic (members of his family are the same), but made worse by work problems and my lack of love for him.

I've spent years dithering about whether to go. I'm nervous about being lonely, hard up, unable to cope and unable to find a new partner, and fear that I'll regret leaving. And, of course, it would devastate the children as well as my husband. He says he'd fight for custody. Neither of us could bear to lose them.

But if all men needed cheap thrills, they would be the first to understand, wouldn't they? Most men, if in a good relationship, masturbate as a corollary to the relationship. Many fantasise about their own partners. All relationships have fallow periods of sexual interest. Sometimes it is less fuss to nip into the spare room for a quick yank of nature's stress reliever. John O'Halloram, Belfast Turn the tables A man I knew bought porn mags regularly, which caused immense distress to his wife. Whenever she expressed her unhappiness he would say: \"Don't be like that. It's only a bit of harmless fun. All the chaps at the office do it.\" One night hubby got home and found his wife ogling photos of naked men with enormous penises and licking her lips. Hubby was absolutely devastated. \"Don't be like that,\" she said, \"It's only a bit of harmless fun. All the girls at the office do it.\" That put an end to his top-shelf purchases. Try similar tactics with sex lines. Tell your partner you are sorry you made such a fuss about his sex lines, that they are terrific fun and that you understand fully why he finds them so addictive. When forced to confront the reality of his actions he will probably mend his ways. If not, a young, attractive and sexy woman like you should have no problem finding a replacement. Claude Shields, Bucks Next week I can't decide whether to divorce. I'm 45, have been married for 20 years and have children of 16,13 and five. I care for but don't love my husband - as he has aged he has become miserable and pedantic. I think it's partly genetic (members of his family are the same), but made worse by work problems and my lack of love for him. He is a good person with many qualities, an excellent father, he loves me, is 100% supportive of my ideas and thinks the marriage is good. I want to meet someone I feel passionate about and give us both the chance for a new start. I've spent years dithering about whether to go. I'm nervous about being lonely, hard up, unable to cope and unable to find a new partner, and fear that I'll regret leaving. And, of course, it would devastate the children as well as my husband. He says he'd fight for custody. Neither of us could bear to lose them. I feel guilty even contemplating breaking up the family, but the prospect of growing old with a man who irritates more than excites me fills me with depression. \u0095 Private Lives appears every Friday.

Later, he developed a pocket-sized, battery-powered syringe driver, which allowed children with thalassaemia (a hereditary haemoglobin disorder) to receive lengthy infusion treatments while going about their daily lives. It has since been used in a wide range of other conditions, from providing slow injections on neo-natal intensive care units to the continuous infusions of pain-relieving drugs to terminally-ill patients, with 150,000 syringe drivers sold to date.</p> <p>Wright's training and rapport with the medical profession, coupled with entirely self-taught engineering skills and flair for design, allowed him to produce simple, compact pieces of precision engineering that could be manufactured economically, applied on a large scale, and became design classics in the medical world.</p> <p>Born in Dulwich, the second son of a clergyman, he was educated at Winchester and Trinity College, Cambridge. He had wanted to study engineering, but was dissuaded on the grounds that it was an unsuitable profession. Graduating with first-class honours in physiology, he went on to St Bartholomew's hospital, London, with an exhibition, and qualified as a doctor in 1938.</p> <p>Like so many of his generation, the outbreak of war altered his career path. After working at Bart's as a medical registrar, in 1942 he enlisted in the Royal Army Medical Corps as a pathologist. This took him into research on the physiological effects of tank warfare, then to Freetown, Sierra Leone and, at the end of the war, to Singapore, where he rose to the rank of colonel, while reconstructing medical laboratory services there. These experiences, requiring maximum improvisation with minimum equipment, gave him his first opportunity to develop his technical talent.</p> <p>By demobilisation, Wright had become a pathologist largely by default, and, in this capacity, was recruited by the Medical Research Council (MRC) for a pioneering unit at Llandough hospital, South Wales, studying the miners' disease, pneumoconiosis, through a range of scientific disciplines.</p> <p>It soon became apparent that the unit needed specialised equipment, which Wright developed himself, starting with machines to produce experimental dust conditions for his own research. He was soon serving as inventor-in-residence, and, in response to the need for a standard measure of lung function, he developed his most influential instrument, the peak flow meter.</p> <p>The device's invention in 1956 was followed by publication of results in 1959, and peak flow rapidly became a standard measure of respiratory function in most lung disease, particularly in the assessment of asthma and bronchitis. The miniature, plastic version developed in the 1970s can now be found in every medical bag and consulting room, as well as in the homes of many asthmatics. Seven million peak flow meters have been distributed since production began.</p> <p>In 1957, recognising his unique skills, the MRC employed Wright to work solely on instrument development at the National Institute for Medical Research, Mill Hill, London. There, he was actively involved in the study of breath alcohol, and advised the government on the implementation of the 1967 drink-driving laws.</p> <p>In 1969, he went to the MRC's Hampstead laboratories, in preparation for a further move in 1971 to the new clinical research centre, at Northwick Park hospital, Harrow. Here, he particularly valued the opportunity to work closely with clinicians. Like the peak flow meter, his most successful machines were developed as solutions to specific practical problems, but subsequently proved to have much wider applications.</p> <p>Wright had a constant stream of good ideas, many of which were never commercially produced. His inventions spanned many disciplines: epidemiologists remember him for his random zero blood-pressure machine, anaesthetists for his Wright respirometer, and paediatricians for his apnoea (temporary inability to breathe) alarm, the MR10.</p> <p>This was developed in re sponse to two tragic deaths in Northwick Park's special-care nursery. Previous alarms designed to detect that a baby had stopped breathing were cumbersome and unreliable. The new alarm detected breath movements via a small capsule taped to the abdomen, and is still widely used for monitoring babies born prematurely or at risk from cot death.</p> <p>Wright was also a daring ocean-going yachtsman, but gave up his more adventurous exploits when, in 1952, he married Sheila Smith, then working at the MRC head office. The arrival of three sons and two daughters put his experience to good use in various contraptions with which to amuse his children, including an aerial railway that conveyed a bathtub and a bicycle. He loved all machines and mechanical devices, and was never happier than when a washing machine reached the end of its useful life, so he could reuse its moving parts.</p> <p>Although his workshop often appeared similarly improvised, the final instruments were simple, but superbly elegant, solutions to most complex technical problems.</p> <p>Wright cared little about financial gain or professional advancement, had no postgraduate or formal professional qualifications, and assiduously avoided committee and administrative work. The MRC held his patents and received the lion's share of their royalties, employing him, in return, for a happy lifetime doing what he most enjoyed.

He also received a prize from the Institute of Mechanical Engineers to add to the two design awards and the gold medal he had won at the international inventors' fair.</p> <p>Wright's one ambition - that his inventions should be widely used and respected - has been realised abundantly.

      "bodyText": "Scientists today offer an explanation as to why women who smoke and sunbathe look old before their time. They suggest these habits make a \"double whammy\" attack on their skin. Smoking helps to activate an enzyme, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-1), that breaks down collagen, the connective tissue that maintains the skin's elasticity, researchers at the St John's institute of dermatology at St Thomas's hospital, London, suggest in the Lancet. Sunlight is already known to have an ageing effect, especially on parts of the body most exposed to ultraviolet rays, but there may be new understanding of how its effects in combination with smoking make matters worse. The researchers believe that smoking helps to generate genes reponsible for MMP-1. The study, involving 14 smokers and 10 non-smokers, revealed that the smokers had far more genetic material associated with MMP-1. Antony Young, who led the research, said this was unlikely to be down to chance. \"Smoking exerts a noticeable effect on the skin. Smokers have more wrinkles, and their skin tends to have a greyish pallor compared to non-smokers.\" His team had been investigating the effects of sunlight by examing skin from the buttocks of volunteers irradiated with ultraviolet light to see if this encouraged the formation of MMP-1. They found some volunteers who were not exposed to radiation nevertheless had unusual amounts of genetic material linked to the enzyme. These participants were smokers, had an average age of 30 and had smoked 10-20 cigarettes a day for between three and 25 years. Professor Young suggested they had had a double dose of MMP-1 from the action of sunlight and tobacco. The enzyme usually helped tissue rebuilding, but a natural inhibitor within the body that regulated its performance had not increased in the same way. Amanda Sandford, research director for Action on Smoking and Health, said it was ironic that teenagers took up smoking to look more mature. \"For smokers, middle age starts in their early 30s as the tell-tale wrinkles around the mouth and eyes begin to appear. \"Young female smokers are likely to be wasting money on anti-wrinkle creams if they continue to smoke.

She stood to gain more, Anthony Donne QC suggested, from a \"dead husband\" than a \"dead marriage.\"</p> <p>Mr Cangardel told the court: \"All I felt was the bag being held down over my mouth. I thought I was going to die. I was running out of air. I was in a complete panic. I screamed: 'You are trying to kill me!' She said: 'Yes, I am. If that doesn't work, I will shoot you with your gun'.\"</p> <p>But the jury eventually accepted a different version of events, in which Mrs Cangardel, trapped in an unhappy marriage, suffering from depression and driven to distraction by her husband's taunts and criticisms, had entered a dissociative state and placed the bag over her husband's head only to frighten him. She had secretly crushed the tablets into his cereal, they found, to treat fleabites from a family dog she knew he did not like.</p> <p>Joanna Trollope, a friend of Mrs Cangardel, told the court how, accompanying the couple at a dinner in Kensington last year, she had seen Mr Cangardel object to his wife wearing a tweed jacket. To Miss Trollope's \"great embarrassment\", he had indicated the author and said to his wife: \"Why can't you dress like that? I wouldn't want to be seen in the street with you looking like this.\"</p> <p>When the two women met four days before the alleged murder attempt, Miss Trollope said, her friend had wept because of \"intimate and sexual\" insults Mr Cangardel had made.</p> <p>Mrs Cangardel, a graduate of Oxford University, described how she had initially been \"thunderstruck\" by Jean Marc, a widower who made his fortune in computers, and married him in 1998. But relations soured, she told the court, until one day she had found her husband in bed during the day.</p> <p>\"I thought, I've not been sleeping, and does he understand just how worn out and exhausted I am by having to bear the burdens of all the problems?\" she said.</p> <p>\"I don't know where I picked up the bag - I was sort of in a dream. I didn't pick up a knife or a hammer, I didn't want to hurt him, but how else can you shock someone without hurting them? The awful thing is, I think he thinks I wanted to kill him, but I didn't at all.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "A garden designer was acquitted yesterday of attempting to murder her millionaire husband by adding drugs to his breakfast cereal and then trying to suffocate him using a plastic bag. The jury at Winchester crown court took 51 minutes to find that 41-year-old Melanie Cangardel did not intend to kill her husband Jean Marc, 50, at the couple's \u00a31.2m manor house in Dorset last September. In a trial notable for tales of high society intrigue and testimony from the novelist Joanna Trollope, the prosecution argued that Mrs Cangardel had crushed antihistamine tablets into her husband's Weetabix in order to knock him out. She then attempted to suffocate him with a bag from the shoe chain Shelly's, it was claimed, because their marriage was falling apart and she did not want to give up her luxurious life at their home in Cheselbourne. She stood to gain more, Anthony Donne QC suggested, from a \"dead husband\" than a \"dead marriage.\" Mr Cangardel told the court: \"All I felt was the bag being held down over my mouth. I thought I was going to die. I was running out of air. I was in a complete panic. I screamed: 'You are trying to kill me!' She said: 'Yes, I am. If that doesn't work, I will shoot you with your gun'.\" But the jury eventually accepted a different version of events, in which Mrs Cangardel, trapped in an unhappy marriage, suffering from depression and driven to distraction by her husband's taunts and criticisms, had entered a dissociative state and placed the bag over her husband's head only to frighten him. She had secretly crushed the tablets into his cereal, they found, to treat fleabites from a family dog she knew he did not like. Joanna Trollope, a friend of Mrs Cangardel, told the court how, accompanying the couple at a dinner in Kensington last year, she had seen Mr Cangardel object to his wife wearing a tweed jacket. To Miss Trollope's \"great embarrassment\", he had indicated the author and said to his wife: \"Why can't you dress like that? I wouldn't want to be seen in the street with you looking like this.\" When the two women met four days before the alleged murder attempt, Miss Trollope said, her friend had wept because of \"intimate and sexual\" insults Mr Cangardel had made. Mrs Cangardel, a graduate of Oxford University, described how she had initially been \"thunderstruck\" by Jean Marc, a widower who made his fortune in computers, and married him in 1998. But relations soured, she told the court, until one day she had found her husband in bed during the day. \"I thought, I've not been sleeping, and does he understand just how worn out and exhausted I am by having to bear the burdens of all the problems?\" she said. \"I don't know where I picked up the bag - I was sort of in a dream. I didn't pick up a knife or a hammer, I didn't want to hurt him, but how else can you shock someone without hurting them? The awful thing is, I think he thinks I wanted to kill him, but I didn't at all.\"",

      "bodyText": "Three appeal judges yesterday took the unusual step of stressing that a man released after serving 17 years for a double murder was totally innocent, and had not been freed on just a technicality. Peter Fell, 39, spent nearly all his adult life behind bars after confessing to the murder of two women who were walking their dogs. The judges branded as \"reprehensible\" Hampshire police's denial of a solicitor to Mr Fell, who was held incommunicado by detectives for 54 hours, during which time he made a confession that has been found to be unsafe. \"We believe that he was innocent of these terrible murders, and he should be entitled to have us say so,\" said Lord Justice Waller, sitting with Mr Justice Garland and Mr Justice Sachs. Mr Fell, who was freed on bail last December pending the hearing of his fresh appeal, had his convictions quashed earlier this month. The former Bournemouth hospital porter was jailed for life in August 1984 for murdering Ann Lee, 44, wife of a retired army major, and Margaret \"Peggy\" Johnson, 65, wife of a banking director. They were repeatedly stabbed at Aldershot Common, Hampshire, in May 1982. Defence lawyers had told the appeal judges that Mr Fell was a victim of \"oppressive\" police interrogation during which he was denied access to a solicitor. Psychiatric evidence showed he was vulnerable to suggestion and a \"serial confessor\", they argued. Mr Fell had phoned police while he was drunk and depressed, and named himself as the killer. A month later he was arrested and detained for three days. Eventually he admitted hitting the women with his fists. Once the police had his admission to making the calls, the pressure on him gradually built up until it became overwhelming. \"The length of the interviews, the non-communication for 54 hours other than with the police, the lack of food and the method in interrogation all contributed,\" said Lord Justice Waller. \"Constantly he asked for a solicitor, and constantly that request was ignored. He asked for a doctor and that too was ignored. \"Finally, under the impression he may have gained that time was running out and that he was bound to be charged with something, it seems he sought the compromise of seeking to admit to manslaughter, not murder.\" Yet, when he did so the account he gave was inaccurate in many respects. The judges said the decision of the police not to allow Fell access to a solicitor was \"reprehensible\". Lord Justice Waller added: \"They allowed their quest for a conviction to override their responsibilities to an accused, and particularly to a vulnerable accused. If that fundamental right had not been denied, a false confession would not have been made.\" After the judgment Mr Fell said: \"I am relieved and happy. It's nice to know their reasons were not just technical but that the convictions were quashed because I am innocent. \"The police will now have to reopen the murder inquiry. They have no alternative.\" Hampshire police refused to say whether they would reopen the murder investigation or issue an apology to Mr Fell, who is waiting for news of compensation.",

Literature, for long the Cinderella of the subsidised sector, was the biggest winner from the extra \u00a321m shareout announced yesterday by the Arts Council, with core funding increased by 75%. A large chunk of that will go to the most impoverished writers of all - poets - through the Poetry Society, the Poetry Book Society and the Arvon Foundation. The still more impecunious world of performance poetry was given a lift with a fivefold rise so the Apples and Snakes group could expand its \"slams\" (performances) nationally. The visual arts also did well with grants up by nearly a third, while dance stands to gain an extra 17 % from 2002. More significantly, 50 organisations, led by the Centre for Children's Books and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, whom the Arts Council admitted had previously had a \"hand to mouth existence\", were also given the security of guaranteed three year funding. The extra money, which follows \u00a325m to help revive battered producing theatres and a further \u00a340m for the arts-in-education Creative Partnerships scheme, comes as the culture secretary, Chris Smith, floated the idea of more money to help individual artists by reviving state commissioning. Mr Smith believes that money should be set aside to help the \"lost generation\" of young artists who missed out on money to develop their talent through the barren Conservative years of the early 1990s when subsidy was slashed and bureaucracy stifled experiment. Mr Smith said he would like to see these young and not-so-young artists, writers and directors given medium term bursaries or fellowships and being \"allowed to get on and do what they do best\". He also wants to revive the tradition of greater state commissioning of the type which the Arts Council pioneered in its early years after the second world war. Peter Hewitt, Arts Council chief executive, described the funding round as \"the best for the arts in many, many years\". Of the big national institutions, the Royal Shakespeare Company did best, with its budget increased by a quarter from next year, while the National Theatre got a much more modest 7.6 % rise. However, Mr Hewitt denied they were punishing the National, which has come in for sustained criticism during the early years of Trevor Nunn's term as artistic director. There were similar large-scale rises across the regional arts boards. However, there were also a few losers, led by the London International Festival of Mime and the Visions theatre festival in Brighton, which will not be receiving any extra funding.",

A bomb exploded at the premises of a political party led by Mr Cavallo, appointed on Tuesday as Argentina's third economy minister in as many weeks - a man seen by Wall Street as a white knight but by much of the population as promising more hardship. </p> <p><strong> The new Thailand</strong><br> </p> <p> \"We don't see the slightest chance that Cavallo's policies will bring relief to those who really need it,\" Hugo Moyano said at a gathering of his powerful CGT labour federation. \"But we do know that Cavallo's first measure was to confirm De la Rua as president,\" the trade union boss quipped. </p> <p>Yet a lot is now riding on Mr Cavallo, and not just in Argentina. The fear is that the country could become the new Thailand, where the rush to the exit by international investors in the summer of 1997 precipitated the financial crisis across south-east Asia and beyond in 1997 and 1998. The Economist Intelligence Unit yesterday warned of a possible downgrade to its rating for Argentina, and with global stock markets in the middle of a prolonged nose dive and the world's biggest economy, the United States, standing on the brink of recession, the risk is that a collapse in Argentina could prove contagious. </p> <p>Latin American finance ministers have already expressed concern that the crisis in Latin America's second-biggest economy could scare investors and push up their borrowing costs. \"It affects the credit ratings of the whole region,\" Peru's economy minister, Javier Silva Ruete, said at the close of this week's Inter-American Development Bank annual meeting. \"With Cavallo's experience, we trust he will be able to take adequate action to overcome Argentina's problems and avert contagion to our countries.\" </p> <p>Not everybody is so confident. Gerard Lyons, chief economist at Standard Chartered Bank, is compiling a league table of those countries' crash resistance. \"Argentina is currently in bottom position, he said. \"Contagion is a real concern.\" </p> <p>Argentina is by no means a carbon copy of Thailand or Indonesia in 1997. There, the problem was an excess of liquidity. Banks borrowed massively in dollars but lent in local currency, relying on the Thai baht maintaining its peg against the greenback. The Argentinian peso is also pegged against the dollar, but at a one-for-one exchange rate which has kept the economy deep in the doldrums for years. </p> <p>As such, it is not just a case of the new finance minister announcing a package of austerity measures to choke off excess demand and put the economy back on the straight and narrow. Argentina has been in recession for nigh on three years. At 10%, real interest rates are crippling, unemployment is running at around 15%, prices are falling in the shops, living standards are declining. All this at a time when the rest of the world has been growing steadily. </p> <p>Yet Mr Cavallo's first act will not be to announce a Keynesian reflation programme involving cheaper money and increases in spending. Instead, he will have to try to ram a $3bn package of cuts through parliament. Why? Because Argentina has been the beneficiary of a massive support package from the International Monetary Fund, and the only way to keep the men from Washington on side is to stick to the tight exchange rate regime. Abandoning the dollar peg would make it far more expensive to finance Argentina's debt, and raise fears of a relapse into the years of hyper-inflation, which Mr Cavallo brought to an end in the first half of the 1990s. </p> <p>Argentina, in other words, is caught in the same dilemma as Britain was in 1992, when the weakness of the real economy was crying out for lower interest rates and a devaluation of sterling, but the government's commitment to the exchange rate mechanism deprived it of the flexibility it needed. </p> <p>So what happens now? The problem is that the economic crisis has sparked a political one. Attempts by Mr Cavallo's predecessor, Ricardo L\u00f3pez Murphy, to address the country's economic difficulties split the ruling coalition, and few politicians seem to have the appetite for the unpopularity that forcing through yet more austerity will almost certainly bring. The opposition Peronists have already rejected calls for a national government, and unrest has spilled on to the streets. </p> <p>As the thousands of workers protesting against the government flooded the Plaza de Mayo and marched through the country's other main cities, blocking avenues and attacking public buildings, university students in Buenos Aires brought their desks and benches out of the lecture halls and held class on the city's main avenues, creating traffic chaos throughout the week. </p> <p>\"He's not going to last,\" said 46-year-old architect Mariano G\u00f3mez, \"one man alone is not enough to fix this situation.\" </p> <p>Businesswoman Cora Iriart, walking past a group of students holding class on the wide avenue in front of the city's law faculty, agreed. \"Can Cavallo pull off this miracle? I don't think so. He's a face from the past.\" </p> <p>If the social upheaval were not traumatic enough, more than 20 cases of foot-and-mouth disease were this week confirmed in the worst outbreak since the cattle-exporting country was declared free of the highly contagious virus. The country of 36m people that is almost the size of India has also been hit by a high-profile money-laundering scandal. </p> <p>Yet, for all the difficulties, Mr Cavallo is seen as the one man with a chance of pulling off what would be little short of a miracle. His handling of the economy in the early 90s won him admirers at home and among the international investment community. What he would like to do is tough it out, hoping that a show of strength will keep the IMF and its $40 bn of support on board. </p> <p><strong> Risk categories</strong><br> </p> <p> If that proves impossible, if he is unable to forge the political consensus necessary to get his painful measures through parliament, he has only three options: devaluation, dollarisation or default. None appeals. Devaluation might allow the domestic economy some breathing space but would make paying Argentina's debt more expensive and wreck Mr Cavallo's own credibility. Dollarisation would tie Argentina's policy to that of the US at a time when the Americans are struggling to keep their own house in order. In the last resort, default is preferable to a prolonged economic slump but it would blow the country's credit rating out of the water and scare off foreign investors. </p> <p>It could also prompt holders of emerging market debt to rush for the exit. When panic sets in, lenders are often inclined to lump countries into risk categories rather than consider them on an individual basis. If Argentina goes, Brazil - where interest rates were raised to defend the real yesterday - will be next in the spotlight, even though the country has recovered impressively from its own financial crisis in early 1999. </p> <p>According to Mr Lyons, the likes of Indonesia and South Africa would feel a chill wind, too. \"At the moment, Argentina is rooted to the bottom of my league table,\" he said. \"But there are other strugglers.\"</p>",

The opposition Peronists have already rejected calls for a national government, and unrest has spilled on to the streets. As the thousands of workers protesting against the government flooded the Plaza de Mayo and marched through the country's other main cities, blocking avenues and attacking public buildings, university students in Buenos Aires brought their desks and benches out of the lecture halls and held class on the city's main avenues, creating traffic chaos throughout the week. \"He's not going to last,\" said 46-year-old architect Mariano G\u00f3mez, \"one man alone is not enough to fix this situation.\" Businesswoman Cora Iriart, walking past a group of students holding class on the wide avenue in front of the city's law faculty, agreed. \"Can Cavallo pull off this miracle? I don't think so. He's a face from the past.\" If the social upheaval were not traumatic enough, more than 20 cases of foot-and-mouth disease were this week confirmed in the worst outbreak since the cattle-exporting country was declared free of the highly contagious virus. The country of 36m people that is almost the size of India has also been hit by a high-profile money-laundering scandal. Yet, for all the difficulties, Mr Cavallo is seen as the one man with a chance of pulling off what would be little short of a miracle. His handling of the economy in the early 90s won him admirers at home and among the international investment community. What he would like to do is tough it out, hoping that a show of strength will keep the IMF and its $40 bn of support on board. Risk categories If that proves impossible, if he is unable to forge the political consensus necessary to get his painful measures through parliament, he has only three options: devaluation, dollarisation or default. None appeals. Devaluation might allow the domestic economy some breathing space but would make paying Argentina's debt more expensive and wreck Mr Cavallo's own credibility. Dollarisation would tie Argentina's policy to that of the US at a time when the Americans are struggling to keep their own house in order. In the last resort, default is preferable to a prolonged economic slump but it would blow the country's credit rating out of the water and scare off foreign investors. It could also prompt holders of emerging market debt to rush for the exit. When panic sets in, lenders are often inclined to lump countries into risk categories rather than consider them on an individual basis. If Argentina goes, Brazil - where interest rates were raised to defend the real yesterday - will be next in the spotlight, even though the country has recovered impressively from its own financial crisis in early 1999. According to Mr Lyons, the likes of Indonesia and South Africa would feel a chill wind, too. \"At the moment, Argentina is rooted to the bottom of my league table,\" he said. \"But there are other strugglers.\"",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The \"That just about takes the biscuit award\" this week goes to the British car firm whose boss sent a memo to staff on cost-cutting that included recommendations on going to the loo before they leave home, rather than weeing during company time, and raising the height of the cubicle doors so that workers who do get caught short can be identified by their shoes.</p> <p>This outlandish act is extreme but not - unfortunately - a one-off. As companies across the UK become increasingly cost-conscious the workplace perk is fast vanishing from corporate culture. The company car - once one of the super-perks for most jobs - is now a huge tax liability. Boozy business lunches have gone the same way, to be replaced by filling-station sarnies.</p> <p>Prices in most staff canteens are almost up to Pret-A-Manger levels. Free tea and coffee is a thing of the past. Even the humble biscuit - the greatest symbol of the valued and nurtured employee - has been banished to Bourbon heaven.</p> <p>Currently the only place to find a freebie is on a training course. Glacier mints are commonly available in bowls, alongside bottles of fruit cordial and the odd free pencil or two. No wonder delegates fill their pockets like hibernating squirrels when they leave. God knows what the tax implications would be if the inland revenue started frisking them on the way out.</p> <p>Perks are a useful tool in business life. Their usefulness in terms of staff loyalty and motivation far outweighs their cost. The same can be true for corporate image. One very bland factory I toured recently suddenly looked perceptibly more up-market and employee-friendly when I spotted the huge bowls of miniature Mars Bars in the training room, and the large pots of freshly ground, luxury-brand coffee in the canteen.</p> <p>Another impressed me when they put out free slabs of home made fruit cake with the afternoon tea. I felt instantly in love with one recruitment firm I visited when the boss went to what he called \"the goodie drawer\" during a meeting and passed around individual-size boxes of Smarties to everyone present.</p> <p>When I was a kid the kudos of any job was mainly defined by the perks that were brought home at the end of the day. The lady from the cake shop was the most envied high-flier locally because she got bags full of left-over doughnuts and chocolate eclairs. My uncle got computer paper for us to crayon on. My friend's dad got tins of broken biscuits. Another friend's father was an accountant and we all felt sorry for her because there were no free bunts.</p> <p>Never take a perk-cull lying down. Today's free chocolate biscuit is tomorrow's toilet paper and tap water. Never ask if the fight is worth it, understand that it is.

      "bodyText": "The \"That just about takes the biscuit award\" this week goes to the British car firm whose boss sent a memo to staff on cost-cutting that included recommendations on going to the loo before they leave home, rather than weeing during company time, and raising the height of the cubicle doors so that workers who do get caught short can be identified by their shoes. This outlandish act is extreme but not - unfortunately - a one-off. As companies across the UK become increasingly cost-conscious the workplace perk is fast vanishing from corporate culture. The company car - once one of the super-perks for most jobs - is now a huge tax liability. Boozy business lunches have gone the same way, to be replaced by filling-station sarnies. Prices in most staff canteens are almost up to Pret-A-Manger levels. Free tea and coffee is a thing of the past. Even the humble biscuit - the greatest symbol of the valued and nurtured employee - has been banished to Bourbon heaven. Currently the only place to find a freebie is on a training course. Glacier mints are commonly available in bowls, alongside bottles of fruit cordial and the odd free pencil or two. No wonder delegates fill their pockets like hibernating squirrels when they leave. God knows what the tax implications would be if the inland revenue started frisking them on the way out. Perks are a useful tool in business life. Their usefulness in terms of staff loyalty and motivation far outweighs their cost. The same can be true for corporate image. One very bland factory I toured recently suddenly looked perceptibly more up-market and employee-friendly when I spotted the huge bowls of miniature Mars Bars in the training room, and the large pots of freshly ground, luxury-brand coffee in the canteen. Another impressed me when they put out free slabs of home made fruit cake with the afternoon tea. I felt instantly in love with one recruitment firm I visited when the boss went to what he called \"the goodie drawer\" during a meeting and passed around individual-size boxes of Smarties to everyone present. When I was a kid the kudos of any job was mainly defined by the perks that were brought home at the end of the day. The lady from the cake shop was the most envied high-flier locally because she got bags full of left-over doughnuts and chocolate eclairs. My uncle got computer paper for us to crayon on. My friend's dad got tins of broken biscuits. Another friend's father was an accountant and we all felt sorry for her because there were no free bunts. Never take a perk-cull lying down. Today's free chocolate biscuit is tomorrow's toilet paper and tap water. Never ask if the fight is worth it, understand that it is. Any perk that has ever been a historical part of the culture should be fought for tooth and nail, even if no-one has ever taken it up, from the Oxtail soup option on the coffee machine to the plastic hygiene seat covers in the toilet. Holding on to the freebies is not a sign of poverty or meanness. The Clintons cannot be short of money but look at the furore they caused when they were accused of de-perking the White House. Bosses love freebies as much as lower-level workers. I once passed a millionaire businessman leaving his firm's annual staff buffet with a Tupperware box filled with leftover sausage rolls. I'm sure from his delighted expression that they meant more to him at that moment than lunch at The Ivy.

      "body": "<p> It is strange seeing Coward's Semi-Monde in the same week as Wedekind's Lulu. Both view human beings as caged animals driven by sexual desire. The key difference is that No\u00ebl Coward's creatures camouflage their erotic itch under a savage politesse, and the author himself views them with a mixture of voyeuristic glee and puritanical disdain. But then Coward always carefully kept a foot in both camps. </p> <p>Written in 1926 and unperformed until the Glasgow Citizens revived it in 1977, the play now gets its London premiere in another sumptuous Philip Prowse production. We are in the Paris Ritz lounge and bar, where we are offered a glittering kaleidoscope of dressy decadence. Rich women find ingenious ways to deceive their menfolk. An ageing novelist seduces a young bride while the dullish groom goes off with the writer's daughter. Meanwhile, a callow youth hovers between the sexes while elderly gays make witty remarks with feline intensity, and promiscuous lesbians quarrel with their partners. This is Grand Hotel seen through a glass darkly. </p> <p>As a young dramatist, Coward has problems handling 28 characters in a seething social panorama. Everyone, of whatever gender, tends to speak with His Master's Voice. A waspish Sapphist describes an unfortunate prima donna as \"the most constipated Carmen I've ever heard\" while the hetero novelist dislikes Rapallo because \"it's filled with double-breasted American matrons\". Yet the play constantly intrigues because of Coward's equivocal attitude to this opulent menagerie. He was always a mixture of cosmopolitan sophisticate and Teddington maiden aunt, and here you feel he both admires the characters' verbal style and deplores their sexual intemperance. The giveaway comes when the novelist remarks of a group of epicene gigglers that \"they're not even real of their kind\", as if gay sex should always be closeted under good manners. </p> <p>It's not a great play but it offers a revealing portrait of Coward's divided self. And Prowse's design and production make it a feast for the eye. Under an ornate golden cupola black-clad couples come and go while Derwent Watson picks out Coward standards mixed with Tristan and Isolde on the piano, and Nichola McAuliffe flashes her sensational legs and drily intones Parisian Pierrot. </p> <p>Prowse's one mistake is to project the action forwards, in the final act, into the fascist 1930s, with swastika leaflets descending from the flies. Coward was offering a panorama of hedonism rather than a prophecy of Nazism. </p> <p>The vast cast contains some memorable cameos. McAuliffe turns plausibly from chanteuse to errant nymph, John Carlisle is excellent as a dessicated novelist. There is good work from Benedick Bates as a wandering bisexual, and Frances Tomelty as an angry lesbian. You never get to know any of the characters very well, but this is Coward acting as the Daumier of 1920s decadence and, through his lightning cartoons, revealing more of his own moral confusion than he realised. </p> <p>\u0095 Booking until April 28. Box office: 020-7494 5045. A version of this review appeared in later editions of yesterday's paper.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It is strange seeing Coward's Semi-Monde in the same week as Wedekind's Lulu. Both view human beings as caged animals driven by sexual desire. The key difference is that No\u00ebl Coward's creatures camouflage their erotic itch under a savage politesse, and the author himself views them with a mixture of voyeuristic glee and puritanical disdain. But then Coward always carefully kept a foot in both camps. Written in 1926 and unperformed until the Glasgow Citizens revived it in 1977, the play now gets its London premiere in another sumptuous Philip Prowse production. We are in the Paris Ritz lounge and bar, where we are offered a glittering kaleidoscope of dressy decadence. Rich women find ingenious ways to deceive their menfolk. An ageing novelist seduces a young bride while the dullish groom goes off with the writer's daughter. Meanwhile, a callow youth hovers between the sexes while elderly gays make witty remarks with feline intensity, and promiscuous lesbians quarrel with their partners. This is Grand Hotel seen through a glass darkly. As a young dramatist, Coward has problems handling 28 characters in a seething social panorama. Everyone, of whatever gender, tends to speak with His Master's Voice. A waspish Sapphist describes an unfortunate prima donna as \"the most constipated Carmen I've ever heard\" while the hetero novelist dislikes Rapallo because \"it's filled with double-breasted American matrons\". Yet the play constantly intrigues because of Coward's equivocal attitude to this opulent menagerie. He was always a mixture of cosmopolitan sophisticate and Teddington maiden aunt, and here you feel he both admires the characters' verbal style and deplores their sexual intemperance. The giveaway comes when the novelist remarks of a group of epicene gigglers that \"they're not even real of their kind\", as if gay sex should always be closeted under good manners. It's not a great play but it offers a revealing portrait of Coward's divided self. And Prowse's design and production make it a feast for the eye. Under an ornate golden cupola black-clad couples come and go while Derwent Watson picks out Coward standards mixed with Tristan and Isolde on the piano, and Nichola McAuliffe flashes her sensational legs and drily intones Parisian Pierrot. Prowse's one mistake is to project the action forwards, in the final act, into the fascist 1930s, with swastika leaflets descending from the flies. Coward was offering a panorama of hedonism rather than a prophecy of Nazism. The vast cast contains some memorable cameos. McAuliffe turns plausibly from chanteuse to errant nymph, John Carlisle is excellent as a dessicated novelist. There is good work from Benedick Bates as a wandering bisexual, and Frances Tomelty as an angry lesbian. You never get to know any of the characters very well, but this is Coward acting as the Daumier of 1920s decadence and, through his lightning cartoons, revealing more of his own moral confusion than he realised. \u0095 Booking until April 28. Box office: 020-7494 5045. A version of this review appeared in later editions of yesterday's paper.",

The LSO's principal viola player, Paul Silverthorne, turns in an admirable performance, beautifully restrained and free from self-indulgence, but no amount of fine playing warrants the piece's inclusion when some of Martinu's greatest scores (Lidice, the Field Mass and the Sixth Symphony) are absent from the series as a whole. </p> <p>No one could have any doubts about Dvorak's Seventh on this occasion, however. Far from dithering over the work's debt to Brahms, Davis plays it up, achieving an almost ideal balance between Romantic feeling and classical concision that sweeps you away.

The telecoms group had come under intense scrutiny in the run-up to flotation last month after some analysts expressed concern that the group's growth momentum had stalled and that the offer price was too high. Answering the company's critics, chief executive Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Pontal said: \"At the time of the flotation, we announced that we were going to grow faster than the market as a whole, and that is what we are doing.\" He added: \"Of course, we cannot help falling victim to exaggerated market scepticism.\" In the UK and French markets, which together account for almost 80% of Orange's business, the group has maintained it strong market shares. Juliet Telford, an analyst at JP Morgan, said Orange - which is majority owned by France T\u00e9l\u00e9com - was now poised to take a clear lead over BT as Britain's second largest mobile telecoms provider behind Vodafone. \"Orange is widely recognised as having the most reliable network and they have a great brand - Orange phones are very popular,\" she said. However, she added that, while earnings growth was in line or above expectations, Orange still needed to prove it could continue to reduce losses, in order to reach profitability targets. It recorded pretax losses for last year of \u00a3409m, and the company is not expected to make a profit until 2004. Mr Pontal said the plan to extend the Orange brand to operations in 20 European countries was still on course. \"We expect that this will give us a competitive advantage in newer markets,\" he said. The group also hopes to have a presence in about 50 countries by 2005. Last year Orange's telecoms interests in Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark and Slovakia performed particularly well, Mr Pontal said. \"This year, we shall build on our momentum, rolling out the Orange brand and GPRS,\" he said. The group aims to launch GPRS - the intermediate stage before the third generation of mobile phones - in July or August though is unlikely to have a strong impact until 2002. There will be a range of between 10 and 15 GPRS handsets available by 2001, the group said. Yesterday, shares in Orange closed down 16.5p at 536.5p. Meanwhile, parent company France T\u00e9l\u00e9com reported marginally weaker than expected results for 2000, with net profit up 32% to \u20ac3.66bn. Its internet service provider Wanadoo turned in a net loss of \u20ac102m, but this was better than the market had been expecting.",

Analysts said yesterday's sell-off in global stock markets reflected deep-seated anxiety that Tuesday's half point cut in interest rates by the US Federal Reserve was too timid to prevent the world's biggest economy sliding into recession. \"This is about a market that is forecasting a recession,\" said Gary Kaltbaum of First Union Securities. \"It's a dangerous situation,\" said Dan Ascani, president of the market research firm, GMSTechstreet.com \"It's dangerous to the economy, because the markdown in asset values on such broad levels marks down the net worth of consumers.\" In Britain, the engineering group Invensys became the latest UK company to fall victim to the US slowdown. Its stock plummeted 10% after issuing its second profit warning in six months and saying it would cut an extra 2,000 jobs. The news follows a series of warnings from European companies whose business relies on a healthy US economy. Banks as a group sliced 50 points off the FTSE-100 with Barclays down 5.8% and HSBC off 5.2%. Telecoms took 41 points off the FTSE as Vodafone lost 5.2% and BT 5%. In New York, Charles Schwab, the online broker which doubled its workforce on the back of the boom in US share trading, announced 3,400 job cuts, or between 11% and 13% of its staff. Shares in Schwab have fallen 61% in the past year. After rallying on Tuesday in the wake of the Bank of Japan's decision to effectively reduce interest rates to zero, the benchmark Nikkei 225 average ended down 1.91% yesterday at 12,855.98.",
