But there was no disguising the fact that he has not fully settled into his new job. Referring to Stuart Ripley as Paul suggested it was time for a name game: \"Hello, I'm Glenn and I like God.\" </p> <p>Ripley, it should be said, is out injured, and the most important introductions of the week have been of a different kind. The players, Hoddle explained, have been getting to know his \"principles\". Tactical rather than religious, one assumes. </p> <p>Whichever, Hoddle is back in the swing and loving it. He started yearning for the training ground and the match-day buzz after \"six or seven months\" of his year-long exile. Today, when West Ham visit the Dell for his first match in charge, he expects the exciting sensation of butterflies to return. </p> <p>\"If I don't have that then I've probably made the wrong decision,\" he said. \"Normally you have that.

      "bodyText": "Glenn Hoddle looked relaxed enough yesterday, perched on a barrier at Southampton's training ground. But there was no disguising the fact that he has not fully settled into his new job. Referring to Stuart Ripley as Paul suggested it was time for a name game: \"Hello, I'm Glenn and I like God.\" Ripley, it should be said, is out injured, and the most important introductions of the week have been of a different kind. The players, Hoddle explained, have been getting to know his \"principles\". Tactical rather than religious, one assumes. Whichever, Hoddle is back in the swing and loving it. He started yearning for the training ground and the match-day buzz after \"six or seven months\" of his year-long exile. Today, when West Ham visit the Dell for his first match in charge, he expects the exciting sensation of butterflies to return. \"If I don't have that then I've probably made the wrong decision,\" he said. \"Normally you have that. But I'll sleep. I always sleep well.\" No danger of sweat-drenched pyjamas, Graham Taylor-style, then. Hoddle has a confidence in his ability which no criticism of his beliefs or mocking of Eileen Drewery can disrupt.

I do believe I can go on and achieve more. It has all happened very quickly for me and now it is a case of handling the experiences that come my way.\" </p> <p>Others may be a little more surprised. Only 18 months ago Gerrard - who was raised on a council estate in the scally playground of Liverpool's Huyton district - was playing his football in the Liverpool youth team, dreaming of a tap on the shoulder from the first-team manager. </p> <p>When the break came, however, things did not pan out quite as anticipated. After a brief appearance as a substitute against Blackburn Rovers last season, he was pitched in from the start against Tottenham Hotspur and asked to mark David Ginola. \"It didn't go well at all,\" Gerrard reflects with endearing honesty. \"He was too good.\" </p> <p>Gerrard has shown a marked improvement in his handful of senior games since then. But despite developing a preference for the centre of midfield, if he wins Keegan's approval it will almost certainly be as a full-back. </p> <p>\"I have seen Kevin Keegan at a couple of our recent games,\" Gerrard says. \"He was here when I played at right-back against Coventry. I did quite well and I heard afterwards he was pleased with me. If he was to bring me into the England squad as a right-back I'd try my best. If that is the best chance for me to get in, so be it. </p> <p>\"But the right-back thing only came about because of injuries to others. The boss [G\u00e9rard Houllier] asked me to mark Harry Kewell against Leeds United at Elland Road, and I did quite well.\" </p> <p>Already Gerrard has played right-back, left-back, on the right side of midfield and in central midfield for Liverpool. \"I'm just waiting for one more injury up front and I'll be in there, scoring goals,\" he says, a reference to the enduring absence of his injured, long-time friend Michael Owen. </p> <p>\"But I do prefer being in the middle. It helps being versatile, though, because when we have both Dietmar Hamann and Jamie Redknapp fit I will be behind them in the midfield pecking order. If I do want to make a career in central midfield at Liverpool, I may have to be very patient.\" </p> <p>Gerrard joined Liverpool as a tin can-kicking eight-year-old, but is now one of the Merseyside club's most versatile and valuable players. </p> <p>\"I grew up on a council estate and loved every minute of it; that's where I learned to play football. Loads of my friends are unemployed and doing nothing with themselves, so I thank God I had something to aim for, a target.\" </p> <p><strong> The jealousy bit</strong><br> The result, it appears, is a realistic outlook on his chosen profession. While hardly oblivious to its attractions, Gerrard - like Owen - is a reluctant participant in football's after-hours fame game. </p> <p>\"I'm getting noticed more now when I'm out shopping or in town,\" he says. \"I do still get a buzz out of people stopping me in the street. You have to be prepared and ready for things, though. Things have happened to me off the field that I really never expected. </p> <p>\"After I was sent off against Everton earlier this season, I had people being aggressive towards me and spreading stories about me doing different things. If you play for Liverpool or Everton and live local, I think you will get people spreading rumours and doing the jealousy bit. </p> <p>\"Robbie Fowler has made mistakes but he's learned from it. He deals with it very well and he'll be a good role model if it does start happening to me in the same way he got it.\" </p> <p>Gerrard clearly also draws strength from Houllier, a manager who in his eyes has found a neat compromise between local lads made good and expensive foreign imports. </p> <p>\"G\u00e9rard is very concerned that the young lads - me, Jamie Carragher, David Thompson, Michael Owen - have a good life on the field and away from it,\" he says. \"He takes a big interest in where we live; he is very much a father figure to us and that's something we appreciate. </p> <p>\"Certainly some of us were concerned when he brought in all the foreign lads. I hadn't even heard of most of them - then again, they probably hadn't heard of me. But they've all settled in and they're a good laugh. We are mixing well and learning from each other. </p> <p>\"There is no division: in the canteen you won't ever see the local boys on one table and the foreign lads on another. We share everything.\" </p> <p>And so, if Gerrard's progress is indeed rewarded with a call from his country in 12 days' time, he will resist the temptation to celebrate in the manner of the so-called Spice Boys - the pre-Houllier clique of Liverpool players whose fondness for the high life tarnished the club's reputation. </p> <p>\"I didn't really know much about all that Spice Boys business,\" he admits. \"But I'm made up that I wasn't part of it.\"</p>",

If you play for Liverpool or Everton and live local, I think you will get people spreading rumours and doing the jealousy bit. \"Robbie Fowler has made mistakes but he's learned from it. He deals with it very well and he'll be a good role model if it does start happening to me in the same way he got it.\" Gerrard clearly also draws strength from Houllier, a manager who in his eyes has found a neat compromise between local lads made good and expensive foreign imports. \"G\u00e9rard is very concerned that the young lads - me, Jamie Carragher, David Thompson, Michael Owen - have a good life on the field and away from it,\" he says. \"He takes a big interest in where we live; he is very much a father figure to us and that's something we appreciate. \"Certainly some of us were concerned when he brought in all the foreign lads. I hadn't even heard of most of them - then again, they probably hadn't heard of me. But they've all settled in and they're a good laugh. We are mixing well and learning from each other. \"There is no division: in the canteen you won't ever see the local boys on one table and the foreign lads on another. We share everything.\" And so, if Gerrard's progress is indeed rewarded with a call from his country in 12 days' time, he will resist the temptation to celebrate in the manner of the so-called Spice Boys - the pre-Houllier clique of Liverpool players whose fondness for the high life tarnished the club's reputation. \"I didn't really know much about all that Spice Boys business,\" he admits. \"But I'm made up that I wasn't part of it.\"",

In fact, their laughter is in danger of lifting off the workhouse roof. </p> <p>Coppell began his last team-talk by telling his players that none of them was to play well \"or you'll be sold by five o'clock\". He says: \"This is the tightest set of players I've ever been involved with and it's because of our situation.

If he were to write \"centre-forward\" on one of the dockets, the administrator would send for the men in white coats. At least, following Mathias Svensson's recent \u00a3600,000 move to Charlton, no more players need to be sold this season. </p> <p>Like his players, Coppell has found the threat of extinction a liberating experience.

But if your players are not good enough, can you make them any better?\" </p> <p>There is another rich reward from being in football penury.

But it is just another misapprehension even though, at their first meeting, Goldberg told Coppell he was buying the club and replacing him with Terry Venables. </p> <p>\"We were going well in the Premiership at the time but at least he was up-front. Did I believe in Mark? I think that's the wrong word but it was hard not to be enthused by him. He is such an upbeat person and he didn't hide behind limited liability. Okay, in the end he did a shit deal but it was a shit deal done with his money.\" </p> <p>A would-be purchaser named Jerry Lim is hovering in the wings. But pie in the sky is the worst diet for a club in Palace's situation, and the threat of closure is still real. First Division clubs are the most vulnerable to closure, says Coppell, \"because everyone is taking a gamble. You have to be in Division One to get to the Premiership so clubs at the bottom say, 'we've got to stay in'; they take a gamble on wages and if the gamble fails, they have nowhere to go. </p> <p>\"The First Division is such a bitch of a division. The teams at the top have already lost six or seven games and by the end of the season they will have lost 10, one game in four. And that's success.\" </p> <p>Coppell admits to being on the steepest learning curve of his 14 years in management. He says: \"People think I know about economics but I'm just learning about voluntary administration, bankruptcy and insolvency laws, phrases that used to fly over my head. </p> <p>\"But I see this as the ultimate managerial challenge; it's modern-day management at the cutting edge.

Negri scored a phenomenal 23 goals in his first 10 matches for Rangers and even if the standard of the opposition rarely rose above the pedestrian, it was the highest goal-per-game tally in Europe. </p> <p>The fans, of course, loved him but even then there were hints that the affection was not shared. A goal might be acknowledged with the briefest of handshakes with a few team-mates but even if he felt some joy it was not shared with the supporters. Right from the start Negri gave the impression that he would have preferred to be elsewhere. </p> <p>That alienation had been illustrated even before the scoring run started. Rangers' first match that season was a Champions League qualifier in the Faroe Islands. Waiting for an incoming plane in the sparse terminal on that rocky outcrop in the Atlantic is not exactly the most glamorous of events. While the rest of a gregarious squad swapped jokes and played cards, Negri sat at the other end of the lounge, talking to no one. </p> <p>At the time it was assumed that his unfamiliarity with the English language made him shy and after a few dressing-room japes he would become one of the lads. The other players thought so and in the meantime they were happy to let him secure the win bonuses. But Negri stubbornly resisted all invitations to join the players' club. </p> <p>By December he had scored 30 goals and had made friends with another Italian, the full-back Sergio Porrini. The two men went to play squash and Negri got hit, seriously it was said, in the eye. He was out injured for weeks and the rumour factory worked overtime. He played little after recovering, adding only two goals, and during that period Smith seemed to give up on him. </p> <p>Smith was replaced by Dick Advocaat, the ultimate pragmatist. The Dutchman may have made overtures to Negri but he now sees him as the man who never was. To recoup Rangers' outlay, Negri was shipped to Vicenza on loan but returned with a back injury at the same time as the Italian media was reporting a fall-out. </p> <p>Last month Rangers took him to Florida for their midwinter break and very briefly Advocaat enthused.

The club's manager John Barnes and the captain Tom Boyd both ridiculed the idea, particularly as slo-mo video evidence suggests Dallas's hand was several inches north of the Van Bronkhorst rear end at the time in question. </p> <p>Meanwhile the Scottish press has had a romp at the club's expense, suggesting McDonald's behaviour fits a pattern of Celtic paranoia, the lingering assumption that the Scottish football establishment is out to do them down. </p> <p>This fear of institutionalised anti-Celticism led a branch of the supporters' club back in 1990 to hire a pair of private detectives to follow the referee Jim McCluskey. Their brief was to establish that McCluskey was a member of an Orange Lodge and thus inclined to Rangers.

      "body": "<p>Everybody is always planning to go travelling. It is one of those activities, like writing a book, that is filed under for \"one day\". In the 18th century, it was fashionable to do the Grand Tour of Europe. Today, it can be anywhere, and increasing numbers of people are taking the radical step of reinventing themselves as temporary nomads. </p> <p>Budget travelling over an extended period is an established phenomenon, with its own stereotypes - everyone hates a smug backpacker - its own literature (Alex Garland et al ) and even a specialised menu, headed by banana pancakes. On the road, there are travellers from Japan, America, Europe, Australasia, Korea and anywhere else that can wield the necessary economic might. The only thing the travellers have in common is that all of them have translated \"one day\" into \"today\". </p> <p>The first stop for the would-be backpacker is a travel agent, unless you are planning to travel overland, in which case you just need a ticket to Dover. I spent hours with a preternaturally patient consultant at Bridge the World, whose reassurance that I could travel alone, without meeting a lonely or dramatic end (probably), was worth at least as much as his practical advice. Think of somewhere you've always wanted to visit, on any continent, and take it from there. </p> <p>If I was planning my round-the-world trip again, I would visit fewer places and see them in greater detail. Some countries, needless to say, are easy (but comparatively expensive) for the western traveller; places such as America and New Zealand. Some are entirely alien, and there are always surprises. In general, the further removed you are from your normal context, the more rewarding the experience. I love Asia; Africa and South America grip people in the same way, and lead them to go back time and time again. </p> <p>It can be comforting, after making the decision to go away, and acting on the decision with a certain amount of trepidation, to discover that what you have done is nowhere near as unusual as you'd thought. Plenty of people arrive in somewhere like Bangkok, go to the Khao San Road, and slip into a comfort zone. Areas set up to meet travellers' needs such as this can help with battery recharging between adventures, but it would be all too easy to spend weeks drinking with compatriots, watching Hollywood movies and laughing at the freaks. It is, I think, important to hold on to the sense of adventure, to throw away the Lonely Planet from time to time and get off the well-worn circuit. You have the entire world to escape to, and absolute freedom. </p> <p>The next pre-departure stop is the doctor. When everyone else in the waiting room has flu or a bawling baby, and you are there because you're heading for the tropics, you have to smile. Some countries, such as Brazil, insist on seeing a yellow fever vaccination certificate, while for most developing countries you should be innoculated against typhoid, tetanus, polio and hepatitis A, and talk to a doctor about malaria pills (this is not, of course, an exhaustive list). On Ko Poda, a spectacular Thai island, I swam into some spiky underwater coral, and 20 needles snapped off, embedding themselves in my fingers and thigh. I crawled out of the sea, blood pouring down my leg. As I performed amateur surgery, with an earring sterilised in vodka, I was glad of my tetanus jab. </p> <p>The chances of theft are probably smaller than people think. It is, however, important to have good insurance. The cheaper one-year policies only cover trips of up to six weeks. If you're away for longer, and try to claim, they will find out. Of course they will. They're an insurance company. </p> <p>A diary and a camera will ensure you have something to gaze at wistfully when you get home. A travelling e-mail address, from yahoo, hotmail, england.com or countless others, is handy for keeping in touch with everyone at home, although it takes away much of the remoteness of the experience. Daily contact with home is not really the point of chucking it all in to see the world, but the odd e-mail session can be extremely comforting. </p> <p>Beyond all this, you just need a certain amount of energy. The unexpected lurks at every turn. There is humour in the least likely places. People in developing countries are fascinated by us, particularly if we are fascinated by them. Meanwhile, there is ignorance in the most \"developed\" of places. On an American train, a Texan girl asked where I was from. \"England,\" I said. \"Can you speak French?\" she wondered. I spoke a few words for her entertainment. \"Did you learn English at school?\" she asked. \"You speak it quite well.\" </p> <p><strong> Top 10 for 2000</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> 1</strong> Cambodia <br> <strong> 2</strong> Cuba <br> <strong> 3</strong> Ghana <br> <strong> 4</strong> Lebanon <br> <strong> 5</strong> Hong Kong <br> <strong> 6</strong> Ukraine <br> <strong> 7</strong> Argentina <br> <strong> 8</strong> Las Vegas <br> <strong> 9</strong> Libya <br> <strong> 10</strong> Kerala, India<br> </p> <p><strong>Footprints on The Beach</strong><br> Young travellers are becoming increasingly adventurous and travelling to more far-flung destinations, with many looking for the experiences highlighted in Alex Garland's novel The Beach. </p> <p>Research commissioned by Visa and STA Travel especially for Student Travel Week and to tie in with the release of the film The Beach on Friday, shows that 18-30-year-olds believe that independent travel is an essential rite of passage before embarking on a career or university course. </p> <p>Despite Leonardo DiCaprio's on-screen appeal, only 7% of young women would choose to be shipwrecked with him. Favourite was Brad Pitt, with Ewan McGregor second, followed by Johnny Vaughan. Jennifer Lopez topped men's wish-list, followed by Boddington's ad girl Melanie Sykes and MTV presenter Cat Deeley. </p> <p><strong> Backpacker's tips</strong> </p> <p>\u0095 Keep small amounts of money in different places. <br> \u0095 To avoid carrying a lot of cash around with you, make use of ATMs. <br> \u0095 Carry a credit card for emergencies. <br> \u0095 Note emergency contact numbers for your bank and/or card issuers. <br> \u0095 Photocopy front and back of cards in case of emergency. </p>",

Think of somewhere you've always wanted to visit, on any continent, and take it from there. If I was planning my round-the-world trip again, I would visit fewer places and see them in greater detail. Some countries, needless to say, are easy (but comparatively expensive) for the western traveller; places such as America and New Zealand. Some are entirely alien, and there are always surprises. In general, the further removed you are from your normal context, the more rewarding the experience. I love Asia; Africa and South America grip people in the same way, and lead them to go back time and time again. It can be comforting, after making the decision to go away, and acting on the decision with a certain amount of trepidation, to discover that what you have done is nowhere near as unusual as you'd thought. Plenty of people arrive in somewhere like Bangkok, go to the Khao San Road, and slip into a comfort zone. Areas set up to meet travellers' needs such as this can help with battery recharging between adventures, but it would be all too easy to spend weeks drinking with compatriots, watching Hollywood movies and laughing at the freaks. It is, I think, important to hold on to the sense of adventure, to throw away the Lonely Planet from time to time and get off the well-worn circuit. You have the entire world to escape to, and absolute freedom. The next pre-departure stop is the doctor. When everyone else in the waiting room has flu or a bawling baby, and you are there because you're heading for the tropics, you have to smile. Some countries, such as Brazil, insist on seeing a yellow fever vaccination certificate, while for most developing countries you should be innoculated against typhoid, tetanus, polio and hepatitis A, and talk to a doctor about malaria pills (this is not, of course, an exhaustive list). On Ko Poda, a spectacular Thai island, I swam into some spiky underwater coral, and 20 needles snapped off, embedding themselves in my fingers and thigh. I crawled out of the sea, blood pouring down my leg. As I performed amateur surgery, with an earring sterilised in vodka, I was glad of my tetanus jab. The chances of theft are probably smaller than people think. It is, however, important to have good insurance. The cheaper one-year policies only cover trips of up to six weeks. If you're away for longer, and try to claim, they will find out. Of course they will. They're an insurance company. A diary and a camera will ensure you have something to gaze at wistfully when you get home. A travelling e-mail address, from yahoo, hotmail, england.com or countless others, is handy for keeping in touch with everyone at home, although it takes away much of the remoteness of the experience. Daily contact with home is not really the point of chucking it all in to see the world, but the odd e-mail session can be extremely comforting. Beyond all this, you just need a certain amount of energy. The unexpected lurks at every turn. There is humour in the least likely places. People in developing countries are fascinated by us, particularly if we are fascinated by them. Meanwhile, there is ignorance in the most \"developed\" of places. On an American train, a Texan girl asked where I was from. \"England,\" I said. \"Can you speak French?\" she wondered. I spoke a few words for her entertainment. \"Did you learn English at school?\" she asked. \"You speak it quite well.\" Top 10 for 2000 1 Cambodia 2 Cuba 3 Ghana 4 Lebanon 5 Hong Kong 6 Ukraine 7 Argentina 8 Las Vegas 9 Libya 10 Kerala, India Footprints on The Beach Young travellers are becoming increasingly adventurous and travelling to more far-flung destinations, with many looking for the experiences highlighted in Alex Garland's novel The Beach. Research commissioned by Visa and STA Travel especially for Student Travel Week and to tie in with the release of the film The Beach on Friday, shows that 18-30-year-olds believe that independent travel is an essential rite of passage before embarking on a career or university course. Despite Leonardo DiCaprio's on-screen appeal, only 7% of young women would choose to be shipwrecked with him. Favourite was Brad Pitt, with Ewan McGregor second, followed by Johnny Vaughan. Jennifer Lopez topped men's wish-list, followed by Boddington's ad girl Melanie Sykes and MTV presenter Cat Deeley. Backpacker's tips \u0095 Keep small amounts of money in different places. \u0095 To avoid carrying a lot of cash around with you, make use of ATMs. \u0095 Carry a credit card for emergencies. \u0095 Note emergency contact numbers for your bank and/or card issuers. \u0095 Photocopy front and back of cards in case of emergency.",

      "body": "<p>I t was in 1880 that the Nice Mardi Gras carnival broke free of its masked-ball confinement and took to the streets, pasting the populace with flour, eggs and confetti. But progress and the \"free\" market must have its way and, by the 1980s, under the ubiquitous hand of Mayor Jacques M\u00e9decin, it was conducted in the modern way: fenced-off places and promenades fitted with commercial sentry boxes at each entry. But you can still get a bit of the carnival - running this year from February 10-March 7 - free in the side streets. </p> <p>(By the way don't mention Jacques M\u00e9decin when you are in Nice. Never you mind why, just don't mention him). </p> <p>So you have brassy bands and leggy parades, floats and big heads, giant representations of the theme of the year. And the battle of the flowers as the procession comes down the avenue Jean M\u00e9decin ( Jean , his father, not Jacques) and for a day takes over from the cars on the Promenade des Anglais. </p> <p>But Nice, founded by the Phoenicians, owned in turn by Italy and France, has more to it than parades. There is the radiant Cours Saleya, a sunny Italianate space resplendent with stalls of crystallised fruit, cheese and sausages surrounded by caf\u00e9s. </p> <p>For those who yearn for the days when counts and princesses arrived at the Riviera with refugee status and hardly a tiara to their name (the Russians were co-founders with the English of \"modern\" Nice), there is the touching Russian Orthodox Cathedral. </p> <p>Inside, it is a jewel- and icon-encrusted bazaar as much as a church. It was built by the Tsar as an offering for the health of his haemophilic son. Now it's a kind of Aladdin's cave of pious and pathetic relics carrying the patina of aristocratic grief. </p> <p>But if the soul must (and should) be satisfied, there is the Mus\u00e9e Matisse. Conventional museums are, in a sense, the scaffolding that holds high, and a little out of emotional reach, the works that made an artist great. The Mus\u00e9e is mostly of works that did not make Matisse famous. Most are from his home, objects that he lived among all his life. </p> <p>Here is Matisse's very first painting, a still life of books executed with painful earnestness while this 20-year-old law student was living through a long convalescence. It is a sombre work: two piles of dark books on a newspaper. The gravity of the application is obvious; there is an endearing suggestion that he was seeking conventional solutions to this new craft (so different from the fabricated certainties of law). It has a touching conformity that contrasts with the wild free fantasy of his Jazz series one room away. </p> <p>Or for a more sedentary morning, you can just sit in a caf\u00e9, eat splendid ice cream and see what the local newspaper, Nice-Matin, has to say for itself. </p> <p>Oh damn, I'm going to have to mention Jacques M\u00e9dicin. His ex-wife chose this very day to inexplicably return to Nice after a six-year absence and has been instantly nabbed by the flics and tossed in the clink on some fiscal matter. There was an old warrant waiting for her from the days in 1990 when Mayor Jacques - who had for 25 years presided over what was called \"a cocktail of clannism and clientism\"-felt it prudent to take off for Argentina. His suitcases, when opened at Orly airport, turned out to be full of used notes. </p> <p>He returned eventually to pay a few months' debt to society and then went off last year to Uruguay, where, the French tell us, he \"flows the happy days\". The unfortunate ex-Mme M\u00e9dicin was just temporarily caught by a stale warrant. </p> <p>That's Nice for you. I wanted to spare the town its blushes, but there it is, M\u00e9dicin front page news again. But Nice is a broad . . . well, I wouldn't say church exactly; more a broad casino, and they don't blush easily. </p> <p>However, none of this affects the casual visitor, the one with a taste for historical relics, sea breeze and good food. </p> <p>If you want to feel you are part of a spectacle when you eat, there is the splendid Brasserie Flo on rue Sacha Guitry. It was once a theatre and now the cooks, in full view on stage, perform behind a glass panel, eternally Waiting for Wesker. </p> <p>And if you are yearning to pretend you have broken the bank at Monte Carlo, stop off for tea on the Hotel Negresco on the Promenade des Anglais. Then on to Menton by the Grande Corniche. Originally an old Roman road, this is a spectacular ride in and out of tunnels to resplendent views familiar from car chases in To Catch a Thief to The Persuaders. If you are delicate, vertigo-wise, you can throttle down to the Moyenne Corniche or, if a downright coward, there is the Corniche Inf\u00e9rieure. </p> <p>Menton, the lemon town, has a particular charming feature: you toil up the steep, angled streets of the old town, up and up, past the Eglises des P\u00e9nitents Blancs and Noirs, and, rising above the living, you visit the dead. Right on top is the the graveyard, the Cimeti\u00e8re du Vieux Chateau. Angels of the muscular and rather skinhead type obstinately try flapping their stone wings over the weedy tombs, while the wide, washed blue sky suggests an escape highway to eternity for the righteous.

      "bodyText": "I t was in 1880 that the Nice Mardi Gras carnival broke free of its masked-ball confinement and took to the streets, pasting the populace with flour, eggs and confetti. But progress and the \"free\" market must have its way and, by the 1980s, under the ubiquitous hand of Mayor Jacques M\u00e9decin, it was conducted in the modern way: fenced-off places and promenades fitted with commercial sentry boxes at each entry. But you can still get a bit of the carnival - running this year from February 10-March 7 - free in the side streets. (By the way don't mention Jacques M\u00e9decin when you are in Nice. Never you mind why, just don't mention him). So you have brassy bands and leggy parades, floats and big heads, giant representations of the theme of the year. And the battle of the flowers as the procession comes down the avenue Jean M\u00e9decin ( Jean , his father, not Jacques) and for a day takes over from the cars on the Promenade des Anglais. But Nice, founded by the Phoenicians, owned in turn by Italy and France, has more to it than parades. There is the radiant Cours Saleya, a sunny Italianate space resplendent with stalls of crystallised fruit, cheese and sausages surrounded by caf\u00e9s. For those who yearn for the days when counts and princesses arrived at the Riviera with refugee status and hardly a tiara to their name (the Russians were co-founders with the English of \"modern\" Nice), there is the touching Russian Orthodox Cathedral. Inside, it is a jewel- and icon-encrusted bazaar as much as a church. It was built by the Tsar as an offering for the health of his haemophilic son. Now it's a kind of Aladdin's cave of pious and pathetic relics carrying the patina of aristocratic grief. But if the soul must (and should) be satisfied, there is the Mus\u00e9e Matisse. Conventional museums are, in a sense, the scaffolding that holds high, and a little out of emotional reach, the works that made an artist great. The Mus\u00e9e is mostly of works that did not make Matisse famous. Most are from his home, objects that he lived among all his life. Here is Matisse's very first painting, a still life of books executed with painful earnestness while this 20-year-old law student was living through a long convalescence. It is a sombre work: two piles of dark books on a newspaper. The gravity of the application is obvious; there is an endearing suggestion that he was seeking conventional solutions to this new craft (so different from the fabricated certainties of law). It has a touching conformity that contrasts with the wild free fantasy of his Jazz series one room away. Or for a more sedentary morning, you can just sit in a caf\u00e9, eat splendid ice cream and see what the local newspaper, Nice-Matin, has to say for itself. Oh damn, I'm going to have to mention Jacques M\u00e9dicin. His ex-wife chose this very day to inexplicably return to Nice after a six-year absence and has been instantly nabbed by the flics and tossed in the clink on some fiscal matter. There was an old warrant waiting for her from the days in 1990 when Mayor Jacques - who had for 25 years presided over what was called \"a cocktail of clannism and clientism\"-felt it prudent to take off for Argentina. His suitcases, when opened at Orly airport, turned out to be full of used notes. He returned eventually to pay a few months' debt to society and then went off last year to Uruguay, where, the French tell us, he \"flows the happy days\". The unfortunate ex-Mme M\u00e9dicin was just temporarily caught by a stale warrant. That's Nice for you. I wanted to spare the town its blushes, but there it is, M\u00e9dicin front page news again. But Nice is a broad . . . well, I wouldn't say church exactly; more a broad casino, and they don't blush easily. However, none of this affects the casual visitor, the one with a taste for historical relics, sea breeze and good food. If you want to feel you are part of a spectacle when you eat, there is the splendid Brasserie Flo on rue Sacha Guitry. It was once a theatre and now the cooks, in full view on stage, perform behind a glass panel, eternally Waiting for Wesker. And if you are yearning to pretend you have broken the bank at Monte Carlo, stop off for tea on the Hotel Negresco on the Promenade des Anglais. Then on to Menton by the Grande Corniche. Originally an old Roman road, this is a spectacular ride in and out of tunnels to resplendent views familiar from car chases in To Catch a Thief to The Persuaders. If you are delicate, vertigo-wise, you can throttle down to the Moyenne Corniche or, if a downright coward, there is the Corniche Inf\u00e9rieure. Menton, the lemon town, has a particular charming feature: you toil up the steep, angled streets of the old town, up and up, past the Eglises des P\u00e9nitents Blancs and Noirs, and, rising above the living, you visit the dead. Right on top is the the graveyard, the Cimeti\u00e8re du Vieux Chateau. Angels of the muscular and rather skinhead type obstinately try flapping their stone wings over the weedy tombs, while the wide, washed blue sky suggests an escape highway to eternity for the righteous. The rest of us can sip our Pernod and wait for the charabanc to the nether region. Despite massive real-estate development, the Riviera preserves very convincing fragments of its mythical past. We stayed at the Hotel Aiglon, a luxurious little mansion on the Ave de la Madone. It has been family run since 1925.

Centred entirely on the minute detail of one man's life, the book's painstaking and often painful unfolding of his haphazard progress through life demonstrated her determination to transform banality into something remarkable, to commemorate the complexity and strange beauty of the everyday. </p> <p>This attachment to ordinary life is not something that the author is above satirising in this superlative collection, going so far as to spell it out in one story, \"Soup du Jour\": \"Everyone is coming out these days for the pleasures of ordinary existence. Sunsets. Dandelions. Fencing in the backyard and staying at home. 'The quotidian is where it's at,' Herb Rhinelander wrote last week in his nationwide syndicated column. 'People are getting their highs on the level rollercoaster of everydayness, dipping their daily bread in the soup of common delight and simple sensation.' \" </p> <p>In the topsy-turvy, thrill-fleeing world of this story, \"adolescent girls stare into ditches where rainwater collects and mirrors the colours of passion, their young men study the labels of soup cans\", and we learn that \"there is no stone, shrub, chair, or door that does not offer arrows of implicit meaning or promises of epiphany\". </p> <p>But for Carol Shields there is more to an epiphany than looking at a sunset or a soup can. Dressing Up for the Carnival, far from being an inventory of the quotidian, is crammed full of oddity and downright peculiarity, stories of outlandish inventiveness jostling with pieces of sly, knowing comedy and tender, pathos-filled tales of loss and grief. </p> <p>Often, Shields goes all out for an impression of whimsy and cuteness, before veering off wildly into unknown and unpredictable territory. \"Invention\" begins with the wholesome sentence \"My grandmother, as everyone knows, was the inventor of the steering wheel muff\", but this brief resum\u00e9 soon yields to a whole litany of blatantly fabricated forebears, from the grammarian who invented the hyphen to the Greek shepherd boy who, finding himself overcome with boredom on an ancient hillside, happened across the daydream. The creator of this unlikely roll-call of achievement perversely laments his own lack of inventiveness, while at the same time mounting a spirited defence of those who must simply keep the records, \"interpret, analyse, speculate\". </p> <p>Each of these 22 stories is a self-contained unit, and yet there is a sense in which the entire collection has been assembled in such a way as to set up mirrors, parallels and opposites. Unlike many other assortments of short fiction, there is no feeling of random gathering, nor of any stilted coercion of pieces made to dance to an arbitrary theme. The stories that echo one another do so subtly and quietly, similarities suggesting themselves in an unshowy manner. </p> <p>In \"Windows\", two artists find themselves the subject of a new and unwelcome window tax that deprives them of natural light and compels one of them to undertake a mammoth project - painting a slab of plywood to recreate the peculiar effect of window glass, \"a steaming liquid that has been frozen into a solid plane\".</p> <p>The process of creation is vexing, glassiness eluding her, until the moment at which it suddenly arrives, yielding \"not real light, but the idea of light - infinitely more alluring than light itself\". It is an artistic triumph that owes much to \"illusion, accident, meticulous attention\", and results in the creation of a simulacrum much more satisfying than its real counterpart, providing a window \"that would rest in the folds of the mind as all that was ideal and desirable in the opening, beckoning, sensuous world\". </p> <p>That beckoning, sensuous world is held firmly at bay in another story, \"Mirrors\", in which a middle-aged couple deny themselves the pleasure and pain of mirrors at their country cottage, consigning themselves each year to a period of self-sightlessness. Shields undercuts the apparent high-mindedness of this sacrifice - its notion of renouncing vanity and superficiality - with a sad description of the narcissism and opacity of married life, in which the husband is moved to detect \"something theatrical and childish about cultivated denial, something stubbornly wilful and self-cherishing\". These are two people who know each other so well that they can assume each other's identity, yet who survive by the deliberate suppression of secrets. </p> <p>Throughout, Shields extends a humane and sympathetic hand to her characters, many of them intent on eking out their lives, on creating something lasting or valuable in the face of loss and absence. This compassion survives the most brutal and unsparing comic treatment, as in the delightfully irreverent story \"Ilk\".</p> <p>Here a literary theorist, injured by criticism of her \"atemporal paradigms\" in the spring issue of Ficto-Factions, trades theories of narrative with a colleague at a conference. As their talk of fictive modules and micro-discourses progresses, or fails to, she is fixated by the one strand of narrative that will never be broached: the suicide of her colleague's wife. What could the one-word note she left behind have said? That word - \"the central modality... the narrational heart\" - resists discovery, and leaves these two slightly ridiculous characters exactly where they began, fighting over the last shrimp on a tray of canap\u00e9s. </p> <p>But where Shields ridicules, she also repairs; she is a writer who pays extraordinary attention to the importance of reparation and recuperation. The fragility of her characters' lives, \"their cycles of consolation and enhancement\", provides her with a narrative toughness, an ability to catalogue without falling into clich\u00e9 or cuteness. </p> <p> Several of the stories are narrated by writers; one is run ragged in old age by the perverse attentions of a biographer, another tormented by the lack of a letter \"I\" on her keyboard.

      "body": "<p>Watchtowers, ramparts, a suicidal sea smashing itself below the fortress walls. Elsinore? No Essaouira. Orson Welles could have filmed Hamlet here. Perhaps sensibly, he went for Othello, altogether more suited to the medina and the mosques. But Essaouira is a chameleon town, quite capable of adapting to the wiles and guiles of Hollywood. </p> <p>The more familiar in-your-face Morocco can be a turn off as well as an allure. But hassle-free Essaouira is literally set apart from the rest of the country. Three hours' drive north from Agadir or west from Marrakech, it's ideal as a 48-hour side trip if you're staying at either of the larger centres. </p> <p>Access by road isn't as difficult as it used to be by sea. But the place has always been selective about those it admitted to its port and portals. Historically, traders were welcome; pirates not. Now, it's mostly individual tourists and couples who come to stay in its small hotels; the lack of huge hotels discourages packaged holiday invaders. The small-scale accommodation on offer ranges from the backpacking to the bijou. </p> <p>You arrive dustily in a shared sky-blue Mercedes taxi, or humped and bumped along in a bus to a buggy debouching point just outside the town walls that does nothing to prepare you for the surprise lying within. Through the gate, a street spreads out. The market runs through it, and along it: fruit and veg and chickens in the first section; then, through a second portal, to bolts of cloth and cheap clothes - traditional robes and mostly western sports kit; then there's a side order of souks offering jewellery and silverware. Another portal opens on to a section of really useful things: pots and pans and bottled water. A final section takes you inside the town walls, past the clocktower and the palms. Little hotels and craft shops lurk here; alleyways hung with carpets on the warm town walls. Aladdin's caves of carvings and lamps beckon from dark shops. And beyond this, through a final arch, is the boat-building yard and fishing harbour, pincered and protected by the arms of the sea-wall, giving it the appropriate shape of a lobster's claw. Turn left, and you're at the start of the broad promenade that parallels the beach, which stretches for miles. But we'll come back to that. </p> <p>What's special is the scale and neatness of the place. The market street you've just come along is shadily arcaded on either side and traffic-free except for porters' barrows and bikes. With its white walls and blue-shuttered windows, it's a sort of Moorish Toytown. Forget the labyrinthine bazaars of other Moroccan towns: the souks here seem to have been laid out on a grid by a logical Frenchman. </p> <p>And indeed they were. An 18th-century local ruler, Sultan Sidi Mohammed had the good fortune to capture a French vessel. On board was one Theodore Cournut who was persuaded to use his architectural and engineering skills to rebuild parts of the town and to construct walls, with cannons mounted between the battlements, to deter marauders. </p> <p>Essaouira is one of history's hand-me-downs: Phoenecian sailors were said to be here in the 7th century BC; the Portuguese had the port in their sights off and on from the 11th to the 16th century. There was a large and thriving Jewish community - you can still see now dilapidated mellah where they lived - but only a handful now remain. There was a mass exodus when Israel was founded. </p> <p>Over the decades, Essaouira has managed to grind down the conflicts of the past, rather than be ground down by them. The walls, in the pinkish light of sunset, don't look terribly threatening now. Maybe they never were very fearsome, for the name Essaouira means \"the little ramparts\". In recent, less belligerent, times, the locals have put them to good use. The series of barrel- shaped cellars on the town-side are tenanted by an army of woodworkers who handcraft marquetry boxes and small pieces of furniture inlaid with different coloured woods and mother of pearl. The collective resonance of their tapping is part of the gentle soundtrack of Essaouira. In the port, it's the echo of adzes: the fishing boats, by which another portion of the community earns its bread, are built here. Amazingly, it's another hand-crafted activity; the timbers cut and planed by hand, without the whir of an electric saw to be heard. </p> <p>Other activities are silent. Outside the walls, the sea may be booming and threshing, but in the sheltered lanes, looms are seamlessly and soundlessly weaving bright fabrics. A reminder, all this, that Essaouira is used to working for its living. That little boy ahead of you with a tray on his head is taking his mum's loaf to the baker's oven. Follow the thread from the bobbin held by a young girl and, yards later, it will lead you to a working loom. </p> <p>From cockcrow to dusk, Essaouira works at weaving a sort of web that manages to involve everyone. And through the night, punctuated only by the calls to prayer from the mosques, fishing boasts slip in and out of the harbour. </p> <p>If Lady Thatcher still believes there's no such thing as society, she ought to drop by - briefly. She'd learn that the single-cigarette sellers, the shoe-shine boys, the musicians who waggle their heads and beat gentle drums all have a role. So do the beggars, who ask modestly for \"one dirham, monsieur\" (\u00a31 is worth between 15 and 16 dirhams). Gradually, the thought occurs that maybe it's not so much you being generous enough to give something to a beggar, but that the beggar is being gracious enough to recognise you as part of the scene. </p> <p>Fanciful, perhaps, but even the hardest of haggling tourists here is thrown by a joke or a generous gesture by a local. There are waiters in the caf\u00e9s in the Place Moulay el Hassan who'll bring you fresh orange juice, a milky coffee and a baguette with butter and apricot jam for around \u00a31. From lunch to early evening, you can sit at the fish stalls between the Place and the port and have a plate of sardines grilled for you. With bread and a salad of chopped tomatoes and onions, it's 80 pence. A sole will cost around \u00a32; seabass \u00a33 or \u00a34. The freshness factor - given the incredibly short distance between trawler and open-air grill - can't be higher anywhere. </p> <p> Some of the joys of Essaouira are best experienced on an empty stomach, however. The Altantic besieging the fortress walls is only half the story. Turn towards the beach, and you have an ocean (relatively) becalmed. Not quite, for there is always a stiff breeze. It deters long-term sunbathers, but it is paradise for wind surfers. March and April are the months when Windy City, Africa, as the stickers on the backpacks say, most comes into its own. Then, the two or three \u00e9coles de voile on the beach are thronged. No motors, no towlines. Just perfect peace, even if you are doing no more than dawdling over a soft drink in a beachside caff. </p> <p>Now it's mostly the French and German bourgeoisie who commune with the waves. A generation ago, hippies rather than dippies were most in evidence. Cat Stevens found Allah here, and Jimi Hendrix wrote Castles in the Sand, puffing, strumming and shagging for several golden summers. There are occasional faint echoes of that (if you're lucky enough to spot them). But you're far more likely to encounter the fine-upstanding rather than the horizontally inclined. </p> <p><strong>5 of the best</strong></p> <p><strong> Places to eat</strong><br> 1<strong> The fish stalls,</strong> just outside the gateway to the port. Plain grilled only - but the fish couldn't be fresher or cheaper. <br> 2<strong> Chez Sam</strong> . On the quayside. Piscatorial delights in a expensive nautical setting. <br> 3 <strong> Restaurant Le Coquillage</strong> , just inside the port area. If Chez Sam is full, this will do nicely. <br> 4 <strong> Restaurant Essalam,</strong> Place Prince Moulay Hassan. Go for the tajines - slow-cooked meat or fish stews. <br> 5<strong> Patisserie Driss,</strong> Place Prince Moulay Hassan. Driss is French bliss. </p> <p><strong> If you've any energy left over...</strong><br> 1<strong> Go windsurfing.</strong> Try an \u00e9 cole de voile by the beach. <br> 2<strong> Fly a kite.</strong> It's almost always windy. <br> 3<strong> Join in the football on the beach. </strong> Players of all standards welcome. <br> 4<strong> Try to find a new bar.</strong> There are not that many. <br> 5<strong> Keep right on to the end of the beach.</strong> It's inexhaustable - even if you're not. <br> </p> <p> <strong> The practicals</strong><br> Simply Cities &amp; Short Breaks (020-8541 2222) has three nights' B&amp;B in Marrakech at the four-star Hotel Tichka Salamb from \u00a3454pp, including return scheduled flights from Gatwick and transfers (\u00a3377 for two nights). Essaouira is four hours by bus from Marrakech (about \u00a31), or three hours in a communal taxi (\u00a33 ). Villa Maroc, Rue Abdallah ben Yassin, costs from \u00a330pp per night. Several budget places cost \u00a310-\u00a315pp.</p>",

Fanciful, perhaps, but even the hardest of haggling tourists here is thrown by a joke or a generous gesture by a local. There are waiters in the caf\u00e9s in the Place Moulay el Hassan who'll bring you fresh orange juice, a milky coffee and a baguette with butter and apricot jam for around \u00a31. From lunch to early evening, you can sit at the fish stalls between the Place and the port and have a plate of sardines grilled for you. With bread and a salad of chopped tomatoes and onions, it's 80 pence. A sole will cost around \u00a32; seabass \u00a33 or \u00a34. The freshness factor - given the incredibly short distance between trawler and open-air grill - can't be higher anywhere. Some of the joys of Essaouira are best experienced on an empty stomach, however. The Altantic besieging the fortress walls is only half the story. Turn towards the beach, and you have an ocean (relatively) becalmed. Not quite, for there is always a stiff breeze. It deters long-term sunbathers, but it is paradise for wind surfers. March and April are the months when Windy City, Africa, as the stickers on the backpacks say, most comes into its own. Then, the two or three \u00e9coles de voile on the beach are thronged. No motors, no towlines. Just perfect peace, even if you are doing no more than dawdling over a soft drink in a beachside caff. Now it's mostly the French and German bourgeoisie who commune with the waves. A generation ago, hippies rather than dippies were most in evidence. Cat Stevens found Allah here, and Jimi Hendrix wrote Castles in the Sand, puffing, strumming and shagging for several golden summers. There are occasional faint echoes of that (if you're lucky enough to spot them). But you're far more likely to encounter the fine-upstanding rather than the horizontally inclined. 5 of the best Places to eat 1 The fish stalls, just outside the gateway to the port. Plain grilled only - but the fish couldn't be fresher or cheaper. 2 Chez Sam . On the quayside. Piscatorial delights in a expensive nautical setting. 3 Restaurant Le Coquillage , just inside the port area. If Chez Sam is full, this will do nicely. 4 Restaurant Essalam, Place Prince Moulay Hassan. Go for the tajines - slow-cooked meat or fish stews. 5 Patisserie Driss, Place Prince Moulay Hassan. Driss is French bliss. If you've any energy left over... 1 Go windsurfing. Try an \u00e9 cole de voile by the beach. 2 Fly a kite. It's almost always windy. 3 Join in the football on the beach. Players of all standards welcome. 4 Try to find a new bar. There are not that many. 5 Keep right on to the end of the beach. It's inexhaustable - even if you're not. The practicals Simply Cities &amp; Short Breaks (020-8541 2222) has three nights' B&amp;B in Marrakech at the four-star Hotel Tichka Salamb from \u00a3454pp, including return scheduled flights from Gatwick and transfers (\u00a3377 for two nights). Essaouira is four hours by bus from Marrakech (about \u00a31), or three hours in a communal taxi (\u00a33 ). Villa Maroc, Rue Abdallah ben Yassin, costs from \u00a330pp per night. Several budget places cost \u00a310-\u00a315pp.",

      "bodyText": "An influential shareholder in NatWest yesterday publicly backed Royal Bank of Scotland's \u00a323bn bid and urged his fellow investors to follow quickly to prevent the beleaguered bank escaping either of the Scottish bidders. The plea was made by Glasgow-based Britannic Asset Management, which controls just under 1% - worth \u00a3158m. Peter Reid, chief investment officer at Britannic, said: \"If a bandwagon is going to start, it's got to start early. It might be too late and that would increase the risk of NatWest independence.\" Britannic also owns 4% of Bank of Scotland, which he said would continue to deliver good value to shareholders as an individual entity. The intervention came amid new concerns, from its predators, about the way NatWest has been axing staff as part of its defence strategy, which involves 15,000 job cuts, against the competing bids by the Royal Bank and Bank of Scotland. \"What really strikes us is that the good people as often as the bad people [are being let go]. It's indiscriminate,\" said Johnny Cameron, managing director of corporate banking at Royal Bank of Scotland. He said concerns about backing the Royal's bid because of potential risks, overlooked the risks which NatWest itself might be taking. NatWest admitted that it had \"reassessed\" its acquisition finance department but denied it had installed a blanket 50% cut to consultancies across the group. All three banks face a tortuous weekend during which major investors in NatWest are expected to decide whether to back either of the Scottish bids or give the bank's new management another chance. The most important shareholders, such as Prudential, Mercury Asset Management, Schroders and Phillips &amp; Drew, have yet to reveal their decisions although P&amp;D said yesterday it would make its decision public early next week. Major shareholders are being urged to take action to stem concerns that NatWest could escape either bidders by a split in the vote, preventing either reaching the 50% barrier. The City continued to struggle to understand the movement in all three bank's shares although noted share dealings by CGU, the insurance company which is backing Royal Bank's bid. The insurer was seen to be buying Royal Bank's shares and selling Bank of Scotland.",

Shop around, as the proportion of seats sold at the lowest fare varies according to the airline and route. Ryanair, which began the no-frill budget flights in 1991, guarantees to sell 70% of its seats at its bottom two fares. Buzz sells 20% at the lowest fare.

If you book by phone, there is inevitably a short wait while the recorded message tells you to book by internet followed by a long wait for someone to reply. </p> <p><strong> Lyon</strong></p> <p> <strong> Car: </strong> There are 40 ski resorts within 2\u20ac hours drive of Lyon Satolas airport. The road to the Tarentaise Valley, home to Val d'Is\u00e8re and Tignes, was much improved for the 1992 Albertville Olympics. Head south-west via Grenoble to the Valle des Oisans for Alpe d'Huez and Les Deux Alpes, and north via Annecy for the Aravis Valley with its linked resorts of Morzine and Avoriaz. </p> <p><strong> Bus:</strong> Satobus (+33 4 72 35 94 96) run coaches to 40 resorts from the central hall, Level 1 at Lyon Satolas. There are two departures a day weekdays and up to four on a Saturday. Some routes require changing coach, and transfers vary between three hours to five hours. </p> <p><strong> Train: </strong> The TGV goes leaves Lyon Satolas at 11.50am, arriving at Chamb\u00e9ry at 12.55am. From there, connecting trains go to Albertville and Moutier, or you can take the bus. Trains run from Lyon Part-Dieu to Albertville every two hours and the journey takes 2\u20ac hours. Most require changing trains at Chamb\u00e9ry. </p> <p><strong> Milan </strong></p> <p> <strong> Car: </strong> There are more than 10 resorts within 3\u20ac hours' drive. Malpensa airport is 48km north-west of the city, making western resorts like Cervinia, Courmayeur and La Thuile easy to reach. Take the motorway towards Gattinara and Santhia. For north-east resorts like Livigno, Bormio, Madonna di Campiglio and Madesimo, turn towards Milan, then Bergamo. </p> <p><strong> Train: </strong> The Malpensa Express from the airport to the Cadorna train station leaves every 30 minutes and takes 40 minutes. None of the ski resorts have train stations, but you can get quite close and then carry on by bus. For Courmayeur and La Thuile, take the train to Aosta. For Cervinia, go to Chatillon. For Livigno and Bormio, go to Tirano. For Madonna di Campiglio, go to Trento or Mezzolombardo. </p> <p><strong> Bus:</strong> Buses leave every 30 minutes from the airport to Stazione Centrale (main bus station). Buy your tickets at the Shuttle Bus office in the Terminal (single ticket L13,000/\u00a34) and the journey takes about 50 minutes. </p> <p><strong> Munich </strong></p> <p> <strong> Car: </strong> The easiest way to access the northern Tirolean resorts and some of those in Salzburgland, with more than 50 resorts within 3\u20ac hours' drive. Drive towards the city on the A92 until you join the motorway. For resorts east of Innsbruck, like Kitzb\u00fchel, S\u00f6ll, Mayrhofen, Zell am See, turn towards Rosenheim and Kufstein on the A8 motorway. For resorts west and north of Innsbruck, like Seefeld in Austria and Garmisch Partenkirchen in Germany, take the motorway A95. </p> <p>Austrian motorways are subject to toll - a vignette can be bought at the border. Check with the car-hire company if it is included. Take snow chains if you are travelling to higher resorts like Obergurgl or to the Arlberg. </p> <p><strong> Train:</strong> From the airport to the Hauptbahnhof and the Ostbahnhof. The more direct service to the ski resorts to the east of Innsbruck is via the Ostbahnhof. S-Bahn trains depart every 20 minutes and take 40 minutes. Tickets costs DM14/\u00a34.40 (single). Very frequent services from Innsbruck to resorts like Kitzb\u00fchel, Innsbruck and Seefeld. </p> <p><strong> Bus: </strong> Take the Lufthansa Bus from the airport to the Hauptbahnhof. Buses leave every 20 minutes and take 45 minutes. Tickets cost DM15 (single) or DM25 (return). </p> <p><strong> Venice</strong></p> <p> <strong> Driving:</strong> Cortina is 160km from the airport. There is 95km of motorway on the A27 to Belluno, where it turns into a two-lane road. Parking is difficult in the resort's traffic-free centre, and hotels often charge extra for a parking space. </p> <p><strong> Rail and bus:</strong> Take the bus from the airport to the railway station at Mestre. The train to Calalzo takes 2\u20ac hours and you have to change here to the bus for Cortina which takes a further hour. </p> <p><strong> Zurich </strong></p> <p> <strong> Car: </strong> Zurich is the gateway to Swiss ski resorts and the Austrian Vorarlberg. From here to Lech is just 2\u20ac hours. </p> <p><strong> Train:</strong> Trains run direct from the airport.

The final amount of nudity after the editing process was minimal. The film received a fitting 15 certificate in Ireland and an R rating in the US which allows anyone under the age of 17 to attend a screening if accompanied by an adult.</p> <p>The movie was never conceived with teenagers specifically in mind. And as Greene is one of the most respected and widely read authors of the 20th century, I wouldn't be surprised to find the novel appearing on an A-level syllabus sometime soon.

      "bodyText": "Dear Antony, I believe censorship in various forms is an important element in the education of children, and the responsibility we all share as parents and teachers alike cannot be shirked or taken lightly, which is why I am so appalled at the BBFC's decision to grant The End of the Affair an 18 certificate. As a faithful adaptation of Graham Greene's most critically acclaimed novel, I expected an authorisation of 15, as I was aware of two scenes illustrating the intimate physical passion that ignited the fictional affair between Bendrix and Sarah that are not suitable for young children. The final amount of nudity after the editing process was minimal. The film received a fitting 15 certificate in Ireland and an R rating in the US which allows anyone under the age of 17 to attend a screening if accompanied by an adult. The movie was never conceived with teenagers specifically in mind. And as Greene is one of the most respected and widely read authors of the 20th century, I wouldn't be surprised to find the novel appearing on an A-level syllabus sometime soon. Prohibiting 16-year-olds in Britain from seeing it is doubly frustrating as the novel and movie are mirrors of the social, cultural and psychological upheavals that English people, and in particular Greene himself, underwent between 1939 and 1946 in London. I believe that the censor is not working on behalf of responsible parents but against them. Yours sincerely, Stephen Woolley, Producer, The End of the Affair Dear Mr Woolley, As a headmaster and teacher, I am delighted we agree that censorship in various forms is important.

Ruskin's ideas on wealth and welfare were far too radical for men who believed not just in a fair day's pay for a fair day's output of skill, but also in the very tooth-and-claw laws of political economy that Ruskin decried. </p> <p>So embarrassed was the future Liberal prime minister William Gladstone at a grand meeting of the Social Science Association he chaired before a distinguished audience in London in 1858, that he walked out. Embarrassed by what? By Ruskin's full-blooded assault on \"the natural law of wages\". Ruskin, however, although his ideas verged on being dangerous at the time was - because of his eloquence, breeding, wealth, fame and intellect - treated on such occasions as a pet dragon. It was best to let him roar, and then either ignore or attempt to belittle him. It was not until the 1880s and 90s that Ruskin's writings reached a mass audience. By then, the British economy had been battered by cyclical trade depressions and the onset of large-scale unemployment. Large parts of the countryside had suffered economic collapse; there was mass migration from rural hovels to city slums; and finance capital had expanded massively (away from the nose-to-grindstone manufacturing that working men knew and understood), as explained by Jose Harris in her essay, Ruskin And Social Reform. His books, published by George Allen, a disciple whom Ruskin had set up in business (latterly at Ruskin House, Museum Street, Bloomsbury), sold in their hundreds of thousands. The tragedy is that at the very point at which Ruskin had become hugely popular, the man himself had retreated to Brantwood and into a near silent madness. </p> <p>From 1889 he was all but out of sight, except through the carefully-posed photographs of the white-bearded prophet of the Lakes - the Old Man Of Coniston personified - sent out by his cousin Joan and her husband, the second-rate painter Arthur Severn, to journals and Ruskin societies that had been founded worldwide by liberal intellectuals and the working men who had come to see him as a prophet. As early as 1854 he was lecturing at FD Maurice's Working Men's College in Red Lion Square, Bloomsbury, and this led eventually to the establishment of Ruskin College, Oxford, where working men of future generations, sponsored by the trades union movement, gained diplomas and degrees. John Prescott, deputy prime minister in Tony Blair's New Labour government, is a late-flowering beneficiary of Ruskin's interest in adult education. Ruskin worked, too, with Octavia Hill, encouraging the advance of her Working Ladies' Guild established in 1853. He donated \u00a310,000 to Hill's \"improved working class housing\" schemes. As Slade Professor at Oxford in the 1870s and again in the 80s (Robert Hewison takes up the post this year), when he took rooms at Corpus Christi, he publicly denounced the \"great 800-year-old Picnic Party of the Upper Classes\". He spoke of public service and public welfare and intelligent, artistic undergraduates were drawn to him like pilgrims to their chosen saint. </p> <p> Young aesthetes, including Oscar Wilde, helped Ruskin labour to build a model road to benefit the village of Hinksey outside Oxford. In London, the professor paid three men to sweep the streets in exemplary fashion at Seven Dials in Covent Garden. In Paddington, he established an \"ethical tea house\". And in 1871 he endowed his new St George's Fund with 10% of his income (very few of his friends who promised to do the same came up with the cash) to fund good causes, including the, admittedly rather disastrous, buying up of redundant land for the yeoman craftsman of the idyllic Ruskinian future to sew, till and reap. </p> <p>These good deeds may seem risible - Ruskin described them as \"mere raft-making amidst irrecoverable wreck\" - but he wanted to demonstrate that theory must be matched by action. Significantly, a number of young Oxford Ruskinians rose to become senior civil servants who encouraged governments to push through, bit by bit, the social welfare legislation that Ruskin had first set out coherently as a programme in Unto This Last. The keenest of all Ruskinites was John Howard Whitehouse, a companion of Ruskin's Guild of St George and editor of its journal. Whitehouse was elected a Liberal MP in 1910 and worked as one of Lloyd George's principal private secretaries during the passage of the National Insurance Act - pure Ruskin - of 1911. He later founded Bembridge School on the Isle of Wight (since closed), modelled on Ruskinian principles. Later still, he bought Brantwood, thus saving it for posterity after the death of Joan Severn in the 30s, and amassed an unrivalled collection of Ruskiniana that is today housed in the Ruskin Library, Lancaster, and at Brantwood itself. </p> <p>A later contributor to \"St George\" until its demise in 1911 was William Beveridge, to whom we owe the famous Education Act of 1944, which led, as Ruskin had once dreamed of, to universal, state-funded education - now increasingly abandoned by the very middle classes who have so benefited from it. As for his influence on architecture and design, this was very much for better or worse. His love of Venice led to a spate of rash, pseudo-Venetian building in Britain in the 1860s and 70s; Ruskin detested it. More importantly, his belief that architecture and morality were inseparable, that the walls of an \"honest\" building were to be raised up from a plan that reflected the function of that building, was to have a profound effect on architects of the Arts &amp; Crafts movement, on the Bauhaus, on Le Corbusier and on practitioners of the Modern Movement. Today, many architects, not least Richard MacCormac, designer of the Ruskin Library, are clearly affected by Ruskin. (He had ungraciously adopted this idea from Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin, 1812-52, father of the archaeologically-correct Gothic Revival. Pugin was a Catholic, whom Ruskin described as one of the \"smallest or littlest architects\", which simply wasn't true). </p> <p>At the turn of the century, Ruskin was the main inspiration behind the superb Arts &amp; Crafts Queen Anne housing developments designed by young socialist architects of the London County Council. His was the principal inspiration for Frank Pick (1878-1941), the man who gave the London Passenger Transport Board, created in 1933, its world famous and hugely influential modern and democratic design image. This list could be as long as those in Ruskin's paragraphs in Modern Painters. As for painters, he was both wise and foolish. In 1877, he famously libelled James Whistler, accusing the cocky young American of \"flinging a pot of paint in the public's face\" with his Nocturne In Black And Gold. Odd, given Ruskin's worship of Turner. He was found against, and ordered to pay Whistler a farthing (the smallest coin). Clearly the judge sympathised with Ruskin, but libel was libel. And as a critic? Ruskin was in many ways the founder and exemplar of the school of descriptive criticism that so characterises the best British writing on art and architecture - think of John Summerson and Ian Nairn. His way of thinking so very different from the art world structuralists for whom criticism was reduced to a pseudo-science, as if books on art and architecture could be written that were 100% rational and objective. </p> <p>Ruskin argued with his eye and his feeling for what paintings and buildings told him. He remembered to look as well as to read. Since the 40s, so many art world academics appear, as the sculptor Canova once said of his critics, to \"see with their ears\". Ruskin would not have been employed by the Courtauld in the second half of the century. </p> <p>Ruskin - angry, roaring, holistic, libellous, a damaged archangel - has influenced all our daily lives. He is far from being simply an odd man who worshipped Turner and had difficulties with women. If only his biographies were filled with salacious sex scenes, he would be much read and studied. Who, after all, in our hyper-materialistic, burger-chomping New Britain, is interested in the idea of raising the sights of working men and women to the stars when they can have McDonald's, Channel 5 and the Greenwich Dome instead of beauty, imagination and responsible work? </p> <p>He wanted to think about, know, debate and discuss everything that was knowable, debatable or discussable, and would lead to people being as happy as he never really was - except among his rocks and stones, and with Bramble, his favourite dog, asleep at his feet in his study at Brantwood. No wonder his mind gave up the ghost. \"I's a wide world,\" he said to his friend Charles Norton in 1866, \"and there's a great deal in it, and one head is but a poor little room to study in after all.\" But what a study, and what a room. Ruskin lives. Give me a cigarette.</p>",

And in 1871 he endowed his new St George's Fund with 10% of his income (very few of his friends who promised to do the same came up with the cash) to fund good causes, including the, admittedly rather disastrous, buying up of redundant land for the yeoman craftsman of the idyllic Ruskinian future to sew, till and reap. These good deeds may seem risible - Ruskin described them as \"mere raft-making amidst irrecoverable wreck\" - but he wanted to demonstrate that theory must be matched by action. Significantly, a number of young Oxford Ruskinians rose to become senior civil servants who encouraged governments to push through, bit by bit, the social welfare legislation that Ruskin had first set out coherently as a programme in Unto This Last. The keenest of all Ruskinites was John Howard Whitehouse, a companion of Ruskin's Guild of St George and editor of its journal. Whitehouse was elected a Liberal MP in 1910 and worked as one of Lloyd George's principal private secretaries during the passage of the National Insurance Act - pure Ruskin - of 1911. He later founded Bembridge School on the Isle of Wight (since closed), modelled on Ruskinian principles. Later still, he bought Brantwood, thus saving it for posterity after the death of Joan Severn in the 30s, and amassed an unrivalled collection of Ruskiniana that is today housed in the Ruskin Library, Lancaster, and at Brantwood itself. A later contributor to \"St George\" until its demise in 1911 was William Beveridge, to whom we owe the famous Education Act of 1944, which led, as Ruskin had once dreamed of, to universal, state-funded education - now increasingly abandoned by the very middle classes who have so benefited from it. As for his influence on architecture and design, this was very much for better or worse. His love of Venice led to a spate of rash, pseudo-Venetian building in Britain in the 1860s and 70s; Ruskin detested it. More importantly, his belief that architecture and morality were inseparable, that the walls of an \"honest\" building were to be raised up from a plan that reflected the function of that building, was to have a profound effect on architects of the Arts &amp; Crafts movement, on the Bauhaus, on Le Corbusier and on practitioners of the Modern Movement. Today, many architects, not least Richard MacCormac, designer of the Ruskin Library, are clearly affected by Ruskin. (He had ungraciously adopted this idea from Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin, 1812-52, father of the archaeologically-correct Gothic Revival. Pugin was a Catholic, whom Ruskin described as one of the \"smallest or littlest architects\", which simply wasn't true). At the turn of the century, Ruskin was the main inspiration behind the superb Arts &amp; Crafts Queen Anne housing developments designed by young socialist architects of the London County Council. His was the principal inspiration for Frank Pick (1878-1941), the man who gave the London Passenger Transport Board, created in 1933, its world famous and hugely influential modern and democratic design image. This list could be as long as those in Ruskin's paragraphs in Modern Painters. As for painters, he was both wise and foolish. In 1877, he famously libelled James Whistler, accusing the cocky young American of \"flinging a pot of paint in the public's face\" with his Nocturne In Black And Gold. Odd, given Ruskin's worship of Turner. He was found against, and ordered to pay Whistler a farthing (the smallest coin). Clearly the judge sympathised with Ruskin, but libel was libel. And as a critic? Ruskin was in many ways the founder and exemplar of the school of descriptive criticism that so characterises the best British writing on art and architecture - think of John Summerson and Ian Nairn. His way of thinking so very different from the art world structuralists for whom criticism was reduced to a pseudo-science, as if books on art and architecture could be written that were 100% rational and objective. Ruskin argued with his eye and his feeling for what paintings and buildings told him. He remembered to look as well as to read. Since the 40s, so many art world academics appear, as the sculptor Canova once said of his critics, to \"see with their ears\". Ruskin would not have been employed by the Courtauld in the second half of the century. Ruskin - angry, roaring, holistic, libellous, a damaged archangel - has influenced all our daily lives. He is far from being simply an odd man who worshipped Turner and had difficulties with women. If only his biographies were filled with salacious sex scenes, he would be much read and studied. Who, after all, in our hyper-materialistic, burger-chomping New Britain, is interested in the idea of raising the sights of working men and women to the stars when they can have McDonald's, Channel 5 and the Greenwich Dome instead of beauty, imagination and responsible work? He wanted to think about, know, debate and discuss everything that was knowable, debatable or discussable, and would lead to people being as happy as he never really was - except among his rocks and stones, and with Bramble, his favourite dog, asleep at his feet in his study at Brantwood. No wonder his mind gave up the ghost. \"I's a wide world,\" he said to his friend Charles Norton in 1866, \"and there's a great deal in it, and one head is but a poor little room to study in after all.\" But what a study, and what a room. Ruskin lives. Give me a cigarette.",

Embarrassed by what? By Ruskin's full-blooded assault on \"the natural law of wages\". Ruskin, however, although his ideas verged on being dangerous at the time was - because of his eloquence, breeding, wealth, fame and intellect - treated on such occasions as a pet dragon. It was best to let him roar, and then either ignore or attempt to belittle him. It was not until the 1880s and 90s that Ruskin's writings reached a mass audience. By then, the British economy had been battered by cyclical trade depressions and the onset of large-scale unemployment. Large parts of the countryside had suffered economic collapse; there was mass migration from rural hovels to city slums; and finance capital had expanded massively (away from the nose-to-grindstone manufacturing that working men knew and understood), as explained by Jose Harris in her essay, Ruskin And Social Reform. His books, published by George Allen, a disciple whom Ruskin had set up in business (latterly at Ruskin House, Museum Street, Bloomsbury), sold in their hundreds of thousands. The tragedy is that at the very point at which Ruskin had become hugely popular, the man himself had retreated to Brantwood and into a near silent madness. </p> <p>From 1889 he was all but out of sight, except through the carefully-posed photographs of the white-bearded prophet of the Lakes - the Old Man Of Coniston personified - sent out by his cousin Joan and her husband, the second-rate painter Arthur Severn, to journals and Ruskin societies that had been founded worldwide by liberal intellectuals and the working men who had come to see him as a prophet. As early as 1854 he was lecturing at FD Maurice's Working Men's College in Red Lion Square, Bloomsbury, and this led eventually to the establishment of Ruskin College, Oxford, where working men of future generations, sponsored by the trades union movement, gained diplomas and degrees. John Prescott, deputy prime minister in Tony Blair's New Labour government, is a late-flowering beneficiary of Ruskin's interest in adult education. Ruskin worked, too, with Octavia Hill, encouraging the advance of her Working Ladies' Guild established in 1853. He donated \u00a310,000 to Hill's \"improved working class housing\" schemes. As Slade Professor at Oxford in the 1870s and again in the 80s (Robert Hewison takes up the post this year), when he took rooms at Corpus Christi, he publicly denounced the \"great 800-year-old Picnic Party of the Upper Classes\".

The BBC first identified the risk to its staff in early December, after reports of chemical hazards in Mozdok, and agreed to equip and train journalists. Although there is no embargo to prevent the suits being shipped, the DTI insisted on an export licence because the equipment is linked with defence against nuclear, chemical and biological hazards. Leaked documents seen by the Guardian show a paper trail through numerous government departments as the DTI requested further information and called several meetings with the foreign office and MoD, despite the urgency stressed by the BBC. Senior BBC news executives are angry at what one termed the \"hair-tearing frustration of Whitehall bureaucracy gone mad\". A spokesman for the DTI said the application was still under consideration and blamed difficult security issues. A BBC spokesman said: \"The safety of our correspondents in the field is our top priority. We are not sure why this application is taking so long to process.\"",

      "body": "<p>Our boatman, Ponty, was steering a broad-based barge expertly along the sea-streams and around the sandbanks that form the Awaroa estuary in the Abel Tasman National Park on the South Island. The journey across takes 10 minutes, clients are delivered to the Awaroa Lodge and then he goes back again. </p> <p>Boring? Not to Ponty, who keeps the Lodge ticking over in this isolated place: for this is where weary walkers on the 51km Abel Tasman Trail stop for rest and relaxation. \"Every morning these sandbanks have changed shape, even if only minutely,\" he says, unconsciously echoing the words of the 19th-century American writer Henry David Thoreau, author of Walden, who wrote: \"The true harvest of my daily life is somewhat as intangible and indescribable as the tints of morning, or evening. It is a little stardust caught, a segment of the rainbow I have clutched.\" </p> <p>Ponty's barge is a vital link for walkers on the Tasman Trail, for the estuary is the only part of the five-day walk where you could be held up for a considerable time - you can walk across sometimes, but not always. And if you are trying desperately to get to the Lodge, that would be a very real frustration. </p> <p>Awaroa Lodge is a remarkable place. There is a notice above the food and bar counter that says: \"Please don't think we're expensive - remember where we are.\" And where you are is miles from anywhere; hours, days even, of walking from the trailhead, or an hour or more by water-taxi. </p> <p>Everything at Awaroa has to be brought in by boat and that includes the staff. They do four days on, four days off, but the days on are done with a vengeance: there is, after all, little else to do in the wilderness but work. </p> <p>People mostly walk to and from Awaroa and they do so from around the world - the three entries before us in the Lodge's register were from Sweden, America and Japan. The Abel Tasman Trail covers some of the most spectacularly scenery anywhere: a mixture of steeply-wooded hills and valleys combined with estuaries, inlets and a coastline of bays and beaches. From Awaroa to Totaranui, for instance, is a short two hours, with lunch and rest stops included. The grades are easy, the narrow bits negotiable, with nothing to worry about and a great deal to glory over. Fantastic scenery keeps appearing suddenly out of the dense rainforest - a white sand beach here, an offshore island there, a range of mountains a distance away. </p> <p>We stopped to rest at Skinner's Point, a rocky outcrop overlooking two lovely bays and, as we did, along came Charnya, from Kenya via Nottingham, who had water-taxied out to Totaranui and was now backpacking to Marahau, two-to-three days away. You can walk the Tasman Trail from a dozen different points, in differing directions and be in delightful places whichever way you do it. </p> <p>The Lodge, the only human refuelling point on the trail, is up for sale, however - the owner having had enough of wilderness after 10 or more years. He's asking \u00a31 million. If you buy it, you have only to ask and I'll come along and rip out the wires to the infernal Muzak machine that infests the dining room - the only discordant note in an otherwise peaceful experience. </p> <p>If most people walk to Awaroa, you can also get there - and to many other extraordinary places on this incredible coastline - by sea-kayak. If you are a novice, it is best to go with a guide from the Ocean River Adventure Company, who, after giving you a paddling lesson on dry land, will then accompany you on the water. </p> <p>The sophistication of modern kayaks ensures stability and almost complete dryness, too. In our double kayak, we were a man and woman with a combined age of just over 100, and yet not even our clumsy beginners' antics ever threatened to capsize us. </p> <p> The seas in these parts are mostly sheltered, though you do get the odd swell and, on our day, the wind was a factor, making it a little strenuous for the unfit middle-aged. But for anyone reasonably fit, it would be a doddle, and a hugely rewarding doddle at that. A more peaceful way of exploring the coastline of the park would be difficult to imagine, while at the same time there is an invigoration of the senses, with the sea literally at your fingertips. </p> <p>There are a series of bays stretching away from the company's base at Marahau Beach, all of which offer easy landing opportunities and, eventually, after we had covered a meagre 5km, lunch. This was an amazing outdoor experience. From the unsuspected depths of our kayak, our guide, Simon, hauled out a small camping stove, followed by plates, cups, knives, forks and spoons and then plastic containers of food, one of which was chunks of marinaded lamb. </p> <p>If you paddled in to Awaroa, you could also paddle out, although the company won't mind if you don't. You could, instead, leave your kayak on the beach and fly. At first, the thought of doing this seems like cheating: an easy way out of the wilderness. But the flight from Awaroa to Nelson is one of life's great bargains, a scenic flight to end all scenic flights. </p> <p>Seen from above, all that sensational stuff you have so recently been walking and wading through now has an air of enchantment about it, recalling times when you have flown over somewhere and thought how wonderful it would be to be down there walking. Only this time, of course, you have. </p> <p><strong>All Blacks economy - a nation's obsession with rugby</strong></p> <p>You know you're going to New Zealand when the plane that arrives to take you there has giant figures painted on its fuselage: three of the world's best rugby players lining up for a scrum. You know you're in New Zealand when you step off the plane and into a vision of black and silver in the airport shopping area. Everything, it seems, is black, with a sliver of silver represented by the famous fern that adorns the shirts of the legendary All Blacks. </p> <p>The fervour for rugby is such in this country that you could, if you wished, be dressed from head to foot, and all the way through, in articles of All Blacks clothing. And, yes, that includes either knickers or underpants, according to sex. There are hats, shirts, ties, sweaters, shorts and socks and, while wearing them, you could entertain yourself by watching a video of Legendary All Blacks Moments. Need some refreshment? Suck a sweet from a tin of Blackballs. </p> <p>There are penknives and pens, baby bootees and bibs, a diary to keep a note of the fixtures and some black writing paper for that letter home - written in silver ink, of course. So all-pervading is the name All Blacks that the men's basketball team is known as the Tall Blacks and the women's as the Gal Blacks. </p> <p>Long for culture? Buy a T-shirt with the maori words to the famous war dance, the Haka, performed by the All Blacks before every match. Helpfully, there is also the English translation, which goes: \"Tis Death, Tis Death/Tis Life, Tis Life/ Tis Death, Tis Death/Tis Life, Tis Life/ This is the man, the fierce powerful man/It was he who captured the Sun and caused it to shine/ It rises and sets/It rises and sets/The Sun Shines.\" </p> <p>If such a concentration on a rugby team seems excessive, bear in mind that the shops selling these things were doing so in the aftermath of the All Blacks finishing fourth in the rugby World Cup. There is simply no knowing what might have happened had they won. </p> <p>There was, though, one small sign of disenchantment. In a field well away from the airport, there was a scarecrow, dressed in the usual tatters, except for a pair of All Blacks tracksuit bottoms. Such lese majesty would have been unthinkable before the World Cup. </p> <p><strong>What a corker - maturing of the Kiwi grape</strong></p> <p>There is a wine shop in Cupar - a small town not far from St Andrews, in Fife - that sells Cloudy Bay Sauvignon Blanc. But it operates a strict sales policy of one bottle per customer; the type of policy that has made Cloudy Bay a legend in its short lifetime. </p> <p>In the space of around 10 years, Cloudy Bay has not only become a cult wine, it has helped establish New Zealand, in general, and the Marlborough area of South Island, in particular, as the producer of the world's finest Sauvignon Blanc. </p> <p>Consider the opinion of Tom Stevenson, author of The New Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia, printed in 1997: \"Almost 10 years ago, I wrote that New Zealand's Sauvignon Blanc competes on equal terms with the very best that Sancerre and Pouilly Fume have to offer, but this is no longer true. New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc now surpasses anything the French could possibly produce.\" </p> <p>Cloudy Bay, certainly as far as the wider world is concerned, has led this explosion of quality. In the 1990s, there was an eight-fold increase in wine exports from New Zealand, largely because of the success of the Marlborough vineyards. </p> <p>Amazingly, the wine industry in this area only began in 1973, when someone realised that the intensity of flavour in the fruit already grown in New Zealand's sunniest region could well be replicated in grapes. Now wineries are springing up at the rate of 20 a year. </p> <p>There are so many that it becomes a problem deciding which wine tour to take, although you should, if possible, visit Cloudy Bay and, say, Jackson Estate before going for lunch, and a further tasting, at the Alan Scott Winery. </p> <p>Some fresh and beautifully-crafted Riesling at the newly on-stream Huia (pronounced \"who-ee-yuh\") should set you up for more Sauvignon Blanc, before finishing up at Mud House. </p> <p>Otherwise known as Le Grys Vineyard, Mud House is one of the more unlikely wineries in the world. It is owned by the John and Jennifer Joslin, who used to farm in Burnham-on-Crouch until they got fed up of building up beef and butter mountains in Europe. When they arrived in the Marlborough Valley, via a sailing expedition, they bought some land and built a house out of mud blocks -hence the name of the winery. </p> <p>Now they sell Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay to Harrods and Selfridges and Harvey Nicholls and can hardly believe their luck. </p> <p>* Wine trails are available in abundance in the Marlborough/Blenheim area. Individual visits to vineyards are possible as well as organised tours.

      "bodyText": "Our boatman, Ponty, was steering a broad-based barge expertly along the sea-streams and around the sandbanks that form the Awaroa estuary in the Abel Tasman National Park on the South Island. The journey across takes 10 minutes, clients are delivered to the Awaroa Lodge and then he goes back again. Boring? Not to Ponty, who keeps the Lodge ticking over in this isolated place: for this is where weary walkers on the 51km Abel Tasman Trail stop for rest and relaxation. \"Every morning these sandbanks have changed shape, even if only minutely,\" he says, unconsciously echoing the words of the 19th-century American writer Henry David Thoreau, author of Walden, who wrote: \"The true harvest of my daily life is somewhat as intangible and indescribable as the tints of morning, or evening. It is a little stardust caught, a segment of the rainbow I have clutched.\" Ponty's barge is a vital link for walkers on the Tasman Trail, for the estuary is the only part of the five-day walk where you could be held up for a considerable time - you can walk across sometimes, but not always. And if you are trying desperately to get to the Lodge, that would be a very real frustration. Awaroa Lodge is a remarkable place. There is a notice above the food and bar counter that says: \"Please don't think we're expensive - remember where we are.\" And where you are is miles from anywhere; hours, days even, of walking from the trailhead, or an hour or more by water-taxi. Everything at Awaroa has to be brought in by boat and that includes the staff. They do four days on, four days off, but the days on are done with a vengeance: there is, after all, little else to do in the wilderness but work. People mostly walk to and from Awaroa and they do so from around the world - the three entries before us in the Lodge's register were from Sweden, America and Japan. The Abel Tasman Trail covers some of the most spectacularly scenery anywhere: a mixture of steeply-wooded hills and valleys combined with estuaries, inlets and a coastline of bays and beaches. From Awaroa to Totaranui, for instance, is a short two hours, with lunch and rest stops included. The grades are easy, the narrow bits negotiable, with nothing to worry about and a great deal to glory over. Fantastic scenery keeps appearing suddenly out of the dense rainforest - a white sand beach here, an offshore island there, a range of mountains a distance away. We stopped to rest at Skinner's Point, a rocky outcrop overlooking two lovely bays and, as we did, along came Charnya, from Kenya via Nottingham, who had water-taxied out to Totaranui and was now backpacking to Marahau, two-to-three days away. You can walk the Tasman Trail from a dozen different points, in differing directions and be in delightful places whichever way you do it. The Lodge, the only human refuelling point on the trail, is up for sale, however - the owner having had enough of wilderness after 10 or more years. He's asking \u00a31 million. If you buy it, you have only to ask and I'll come along and rip out the wires to the infernal Muzak machine that infests the dining room - the only discordant note in an otherwise peaceful experience. If most people walk to Awaroa, you can also get there - and to many other extraordinary places on this incredible coastline - by sea-kayak. If you are a novice, it is best to go with a guide from the Ocean River Adventure Company, who, after giving you a paddling lesson on dry land, will then accompany you on the water. The sophistication of modern kayaks ensures stability and almost complete dryness, too. In our double kayak, we were a man and woman with a combined age of just over 100, and yet not even our clumsy beginners' antics ever threatened to capsize us. The seas in these parts are mostly sheltered, though you do get the odd swell and, on our day, the wind was a factor, making it a little strenuous for the unfit middle-aged. But for anyone reasonably fit, it would be a doddle, and a hugely rewarding doddle at that. A more peaceful way of exploring the coastline of the park would be difficult to imagine, while at the same time there is an invigoration of the senses, with the sea literally at your fingertips. There are a series of bays stretching away from the company's base at Marahau Beach, all of which offer easy landing opportunities and, eventually, after we had covered a meagre 5km, lunch. This was an amazing outdoor experience. From the unsuspected depths of our kayak, our guide, Simon, hauled out a small camping stove, followed by plates, cups, knives, forks and spoons and then plastic containers of food, one of which was chunks of marinaded lamb. If you paddled in to Awaroa, you could also paddle out, although the company won't mind if you don't. You could, instead, leave your kayak on the beach and fly. At first, the thought of doing this seems like cheating: an easy way out of the wilderness. But the flight from Awaroa to Nelson is one of life's great bargains, a scenic flight to end all scenic flights. Seen from above, all that sensational stuff you have so recently been walking and wading through now has an air of enchantment about it, recalling times when you have flown over somewhere and thought how wonderful it would be to be down there walking. Only this time, of course, you have. All Blacks economy - a nation's obsession with rugby You know you're going to New Zealand when the plane that arrives to take you there has giant figures painted on its fuselage: three of the world's best rugby players lining up for a scrum. You know you're in New Zealand when you step off the plane and into a vision of black and silver in the airport shopping area. Everything, it seems, is black, with a sliver of silver represented by the famous fern that adorns the shirts of the legendary All Blacks. The fervour for rugby is such in this country that you could, if you wished, be dressed from head to foot, and all the way through, in articles of All Blacks clothing. And, yes, that includes either knickers or underpants, according to sex. There are hats, shirts, ties, sweaters, shorts and socks and, while wearing them, you could entertain yourself by watching a video of Legendary All Blacks Moments. Need some refreshment? Suck a sweet from a tin of Blackballs. There are penknives and pens, baby bootees and bibs, a diary to keep a note of the fixtures and some black writing paper for that letter home - written in silver ink, of course. So all-pervading is the name All Blacks that the men's basketball team is known as the Tall Blacks and the women's as the Gal Blacks. Long for culture? Buy a T-shirt with the maori words to the famous war dance, the Haka, performed by the All Blacks before every match. Helpfully, there is also the English translation, which goes: \"Tis Death, Tis Death/Tis Life, Tis Life/ Tis Death, Tis Death/Tis Life, Tis Life/ This is the man, the fierce powerful man/It was he who captured the Sun and caused it to shine/ It rises and sets/It rises and sets/The Sun Shines.\" If such a concentration on a rugby team seems excessive, bear in mind that the shops selling these things were doing so in the aftermath of the All Blacks finishing fourth in the rugby World Cup. There is simply no knowing what might have happened had they won. There was, though, one small sign of disenchantment. In a field well away from the airport, there was a scarecrow, dressed in the usual tatters, except for a pair of All Blacks tracksuit bottoms. Such lese majesty would have been unthinkable before the World Cup. What a corker - maturing of the Kiwi grape There is a wine shop in Cupar - a small town not far from St Andrews, in Fife - that sells Cloudy Bay Sauvignon Blanc. But it operates a strict sales policy of one bottle per customer; the type of policy that has made Cloudy Bay a legend in its short lifetime. In the space of around 10 years, Cloudy Bay has not only become a cult wine, it has helped establish New Zealand, in general, and the Marlborough area of South Island, in particular, as the producer of the world's finest Sauvignon Blanc. Consider the opinion of Tom Stevenson, author of The New Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia, printed in 1997: \"Almost 10 years ago, I wrote that New Zealand's Sauvignon Blanc competes on equal terms with the very best that Sancerre and Pouilly Fume have to offer, but this is no longer true. New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc now surpasses anything the French could possibly produce.\" Cloudy Bay, certainly as far as the wider world is concerned, has led this explosion of quality. In the 1990s, there was an eight-fold increase in wine exports from New Zealand, largely because of the success of the Marlborough vineyards. Amazingly, the wine industry in this area only began in 1973, when someone realised that the intensity of flavour in the fruit already grown in New Zealand's sunniest region could well be replicated in grapes. Now wineries are springing up at the rate of 20 a year. There are so many that it becomes a problem deciding which wine tour to take, although you should, if possible, visit Cloudy Bay and, say, Jackson Estate before going for lunch, and a further tasting, at the Alan Scott Winery. Some fresh and beautifully-crafted Riesling at the newly on-stream Huia (pronounced \"who-ee-yuh\") should set you up for more Sauvignon Blanc, before finishing up at Mud House. Otherwise known as Le Grys Vineyard, Mud House is one of the more unlikely wineries in the world. It is owned by the John and Jennifer Joslin, who used to farm in Burnham-on-Crouch until they got fed up of building up beef and butter mountains in Europe. When they arrived in the Marlborough Valley, via a sailing expedition, they bought some land and built a house out of mud blocks -hence the name of the winery. Now they sell Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay to Harrods and Selfridges and Harvey Nicholls and can hardly believe their luck. * Wine trails are available in abundance in the Marlborough/Blenheim area.

      "body": "<p>Maybe inheritance inhibits you. If you want to be an actress it looks like beneficence to have a legendary film director as a father; and simple to ease yourself into the Hollywood echelons when you've played skittles with Brando and Scrabble with Mitchum. In fact, Anjelica Huston was 35 when, in 1985, she played her first significant screen role - in Prizzi's Honor, directed, of course, by her dad, John Huston, and starring her lover, Jack Nicholson. </p> <p>Everyone who meets her remarks on it, and it is true, that in the flesh Anjelica Huston is much gentler than you might expect. She is not the person her commanding screen presence suggests. Today, in the natural light of a damp Dublin afternoon, any solidity in the angled planes of her face, the big eyes, the proud nose, dissolves. She is animated, beautiful, feminine, direct. No evasiveness here. She speaks slowly, in a gravelly voice you might assume was the hallmark of 30-odd years of chain smoking - were it not that she is John Huston's daughter. She is dressed to perfection, no creases, in leather trousers, silk shirt. On her fingers are three rings, all cabochon emeralds, and one in particular, surrounded by rubies, commands the attention. She has slim white hands. </p> <p>There exudes from her an aura... of what? Call it wealth, money. Jack Nicholson once designated it \"class\", suggesting something innate in her, and this is probably right. But still there is no doubt that Ms Huston, in her life, has benefited from having every material want supplied. They are fascinating, these people, living their cotton-wool lives - stepping out of their perfumed bath, into their La Perla lingerie, picking up their Vuitton luggage. And how we need them and their fairy-tale existences. Until we realise, that is, that the fairy-tale can be picked apart as easily as even the best-made coat. And no matter how hard one tries, it can't be put back together again, or not in the same shape. </p> <p>We are talking about her life, 48 years. We'll never get through it, I say, not in the allotted time. No matter, she says. \"Make it up. But give it a happy ending. That's all I've ever wanted... Someone to say, 'And she lived happily ever after.' \" </p> <p>This is where it all begins, I think, with a middle-aged man's fantasy. John Huston, remember, directed his first film, The Maltese Falcon in 1941, aged 35 - he had to wait some time for his success. By then he was already three times married, no children. Anyway, John Huston, aged 43 in 1949, meets the beautiful Balanchine ballet dancer Enrica Soma, known as Ricky, aged 17. One year later, now married, they have a son, Anthony. The following year, 1951, while he is shooting The African Queen with Bogart and Hepburn, a daughter, Anjelica. </p> <p>It is two years after Anjelica's birth, while they are still living in California, that John Huston is invited \"on a hunting trip\" in Ireland - he had been in France shooting Moulin Rouge. \"He fell in love with Ireland,\" Anjelica says, \"and he felt that this was where he wanted to raise his children.\" It sounds great, until you realise that Huston intends to continue his life, a continent apart, in America. In 1954, after a year's renting in Co Wicklow, Huston buys a house, St Clarans, a grand, conspicuously remote Georgian manor just outside Co Galway. Ricky, now 21, and the children, retire to the country. And in this dreamy landscape, this fairy-tale scene - complete with dogs and horses and grooms - and bathed in granular light, because no one really believes this is paradise, they grow up. Or maybe \"grow up\" is a bit lazy here. In reality, they all atrophy, awaiting the return of the prodigal patriarch. </p> <p>\"My father would come for three weeks to a month at Christmas from wherever he had been on location, with all sorts of hampers of precious stones, or kimonos from Japan, or wonderful painted dolls and extraordinary Spanish dancing dresses. And he was like a god. He'd call me honey and darling and my little girl and the house would light up and really interesting people would come bearing gifts from America and we were very spoilt. And then he would leave and everything would fall back into shadow.\" For the kids, he was Santa Claus - he came but once a year. But for Ricky, this intimation of \"real\" life must have been torment. \"She loved him,\" Anjelica says. \"He was a big presence, and when he was around the rest of the world simply stopped. My mother followed him as much as she could for a while until it became untenable.\" </p> <p>You have to ask what was Huston up to. He had married Ricky, not much more than a child herself, and banished her from his reality - Hollywood. And put her and their children in a doll's house, filled up with exotic objects. \"They both had very good taste. It was a great mixture of beautiful things.\" He turned his marriage, his family, into a fantasy he could visit occasionally. \"I think he tried to hide her away. She was the mother of his children, and that was probably her place, at that time, in his estimation.\" For Ricky, Anjelica says, \"her life was my father\". Sure, they all missed him. \"Terribly.\" But for her mother, it was particularly lonely. \"She was very young, she was very, very beautiful.\" There was no social life for her in rural Ireland. \"I think it must have been painful for her.\" </p> <p>In 1962, when Anjelica was 11, her mother suddenly left St Clarans for good. Just picked up her bags and departed. She took her two children to London, lived for one year with her friends, the poet Stephen Spender, his wife Natasha and their family, and finally negotiated to buy a house in Little Venice. The children were given no explanation. \"Just vague things. The education. It's time you saw the outside world.\" I asked Anjelica what she now thought had prompted this decision, and she replied that she didn't really know. She didn't know who precipitated the break. What she didn't say is that that same year Huston's mistress, Zoe Sallis, gave birth to a boy, Danny. </p> <p>London was a kind of initiation rite. \"I was very backward, naive, uncynical. One year in London changed all that.\" She recalls on one occasion crying. Asking her mum why they weren't in Ireland any more. Why she wasn't with their father any more. \"And she explained that people grow apart.\" </p> <p>Then follows that odd thing where grown ups are allowed to behave as irresponsibly and as ludicrously as their desires dictate. And children aren't. Throughout her adolescence Anjelica avoided her father. In truth, he wasn't that difficult to avoid. As she explains, he was \"a rare visitor\" to their home, even rarer than before. At this age she was scared of him, he disapproved of everything. \"My father was an odd dichotomy of adventurous, racy, a hunter in every sense - and extremely conservative when it came to his family, and particularly to his daughter.\" She was as she characterises herself, \"A wild child.\"</p> <p> Smoking dope, wandering the streets of Notting Hill, all in black - \"black clothes, black make-up, black wellington boots\". Shiftless, restless. Moving from school to school. At the French Lyc\u00e9e, she was kept down for two years, \"and they were threatening to keep me back for a third\". She was unhappy, began to get ill, she broke one of her vertebrae in an accident. Her mother moved her to a small crammer in Hampstead called Town &amp; Country, and later on to Holland Park Comprehensive. She had dreams of becoming an actress, something her father had always frowned upon. Ricky, meanwhile, was having an affair with a married man. \"She wanted to get remarried. I don't think it made her happy.\" This relationship produced, in 1964, a daughter, Allegra. Anjelica was 13. </p> <p>And this is the misery of it. There wasn't enough time for the usual rites of passage - to resent the child, and then to get used to her. To fight for her mother's attention. Something was about to happen that would change everything. </p> <p>Come 1968, it must have been apparent to her parents that she wasn't going to stick it at school. That year she auditioned for the part of Juliet in Franco Zeffirelli's Romeo And Juliet and was immediately recalled by the director. Then, out of the blue, her father, who had always discouraged her from an acting career, offered her a lead part in his film, A Walk With Love And Death, a 15th- century romance with Moshe Dyan's son as her co-star, supposed to be filming in Paris. Anjelica wasn't allowed to refuse - which effectively blocked any chance of her being considered for the Zeffirelli. Years after, in an interview with Sofia Coppola, Anjelica recalled how much she resented her father's interference at this point. \"My father placed me in a film that I didn't want to do.\" How to interpret Huston's action? Protectiveness? Jealousy more like. Anjelica recalls going shopping with her mother. \"We had to find something for me to wear of which my father would approve. I remember we chose a yellow wool suit.\" </p> <p>The film was a disaster. The May revolution in Paris meant that the location had to be swapped to Vienna. Anjelica was still avoiding her father - not so easy when he is, as she points out, \"the director\". She didn't learn her lines. \"He dressed me down in front of the crew. I was hysterical and embarrassed.\" She was mercilessly panned by the critics. But the experience crystallised one thing for her. One day she was going to be an actress. She'd prove that to her father. \"School, the A-level thing, was water under the bridge.\" Back in London, Ricky got her a part understudying Marianne Faithfull in her friend Tony Richardson's production of Hamlet. Anjelica immediately started work. </p> <p>From the painstaking way she goes over this part of the story, I can only imagine how many times she has rehearsed it, looking for that link that was missed, that may perhaps have changed the whole picture. How do you make sense of your mother's premature death? </p> <p>You go to sleep one night, innocently imagining, if you think about it at all, that she is on her way to Venice with her exciting new young lover. And Anjelica slept well that night, she felt happy. The evening before leaving on her trip, her mother had come to her, \"she wanted to borrow some trashy magazines I had in my room\". She told her daughter that things would have to change between them. \"We are two women now living in the same house. We are going to have to be more honest with each other. You're going to want to know more about what's going on with me.\" It was a great talk, Anjelica says. \"A really fantastic talk. We hugged and kissed and cried. Thank God I had it.\" The next morning, her mother left. And the following morning Anjelica was woken by Allegra's godfather to be told that her mother had been killed in Strasbourg in a car crash. \"Are you awake? Your mother is dead.\" There is no gentle way. As she says, \"The most brutal thing that ever happened to me.\" I suppose after this degree of shock you become a kind of somnambulist, a sleepwalker. It takes a lot to wake you up after something like this. </p> <p>She didn't want to stay in the house surrounded by her mother's things. \"My mother's smell, my mother's closet.\" She didn't want to see her brother, \"look into his eyes\". And she didn't want to see her father. Not that he was there. Huston was in Rome shooting The Bible. He sent his assistant \"to pack up a lot of items\" and subsequently met Anjelica and her brother at Victoria Station - his emphysema meant he couldn't fly. \"We didn't discuss my mother's death. We didn't discuss anything.\" She says she was afraid at this time of what her father would do, \"That he might put me in a convent or something. I just wanted to get as far away as possible.\" Hamlet was about to open on Broadway and Tony Richardson offered to take her with the production. And little Allegra, only four when her mother died? She went to live with her godfather, then with her grandparents. \"Ultimately, my father adopted her.\" That was noble of him, I say, for want of something more adequate. \"My father was a Leo, a big lion,\" she says. \"It's true, he was a warrior. Very brave, courageous. He was a noble man.\" </p> <p>Was he, though? Or is this just another bit of the fairy-tale? It is true that, in every interview she gives, Anjelica Huston eulogises her father. \"I have always been proud of my father. He was unusual and special and he had that voice and his presence was very big. He lit up a room when he walked into it.\" It is also true that he broke her mother's heart - her words. And his own heart? \"No,\" she says flatly. And then: \"I can't say that her death didn't break his heart on some level. He kept the house. St Clarans was there for years, long into the 70s.\" He only sold it after he remarried, for the fifth time. \"I don't think his new wife wanted to be there. It was damp and cold.\" Damp and cold and empty. </p> <p>The next part of the story has an eerie predictability about it. She wanted to be her own agent, free now to make decisions about her life. \"I wanted to be free.\" She wanted to work, and started modelling. That was easy, she was John Huston's daughter - a good provenance - and she has a great face. Andy Warhol's Interview magazine, Harper's Bazaar, Vogue - all queued up. Maybe it was a lazy decision, but she was entitled to be lazy, she can't have had the energy for anything else. And then, she walked straight into the arms of fashion photographer Bob Richardson. They were the identical ages that her parents had been when they met. Richardson, 42, Huston, 18. </p> <p>And, of course, her father loathed him. Richardson had a reputation. \"He was volatile, problematic, manic depressive. My father didn't like the idea of his daughter with a man with that history.\" Unlike her father, he had no money; she kept him. They lived in the Chelsea Hotel in New York when it was on its uppers - \"Got mugged in our room.\" Four years later, her father invited them on to his yacht in Mexico. \"It was meant to be a rapprochement.\" But it was, she says, the holiday from hell and ended with her leaving Richardson at Los Angeles airport. And Los Angeles is where she remained, because it is at this point she went to live with her father. Having never known him or lived with him as a child, in a kind of inversion of reality, she now met him as an adult. </p> <p>It was her father - she called him dad, \"never daddy\" - who introduced her to Jack Nicholson. It would be, wouldn't it? You can see exactly why her father would like him - Nicholson so charismatic, powerful, a man like himself who had come to success late and entirely through his own talent. It was 1972-73 and Nicholson was moving towards the height of his powers. He had made Easy Rider, Five Easy Pieces, the sort of independent films that Huston would admire and the two men were now working together on Roman Polanski's Chinatown. Huston was playing Noah Cross, the demonic father who has an incestuous relationship with his daughter; Nicholson, the private eye Jake Gittes. There is a disquieting scene, in the film in which the two men lock horns over Cross's daughter - played by Faye Dunaway. The dialogue runs something like this. </p> <p>Cross/Huston: Are you sleeping with my daughter? </p> <p>Gittes/Nicholson: If you want an answer to that question I'll put one of my men on it. </p> <p>Cross: You are dealing with a disturbed woman who has just lost her husband . . . </p> <p>Of course the script is Bob Towne's and Polanski's, but it's hard not to feel a shiver of distaste at the real-life parallel. </p> <p>Anjelica moved in with Jack in 1973, when she was 22, and they remained together for 17 years. For the first seven years she worked hardly at all - just walk-ons - a bit part in Kazan's The Last Tycoon, or tiny cameos in films such as The Postman Always Rings Twice, in which Nicholson starred. As she approached 30, almost over the hill in terms of a romantic lead, she had no reputation of her own. Who was she? She was the daughter of a legend and the live-in girlfriend of the most successful actor in Hollywood. </p> <p>Then, in 1980, she moved out, \"ran off\" with the actor Ryan O'Neal. The affair lasted 18 months - he was a pretty boy, but not much more. As she quaintly puts it, \"The problem with Ryan was that, although horizontally everything was lovely, vertically we didn't get along.\" Nicholson, \"took it very badly\". But then, as she also says, \"Jack isn't the most faithful of people. Fidelity is not his strong point. Living with him, I wasn't getting the affection I wanted, the attention I needed.\" Though she and Nicholson got back together, she never moved in with him again. </p> <p>It was now the early 80s, and still she was getting no work. \"I felt like an appendage and I am not much of an appendage person. When the phone rang, it was always for Jack. It was his life I was living. I was not living my own life.\" She was envious of his career. \"Extremely.\" Here she was suspended between these two powerful men. She knew it. \"I wanted a career and I had this strong feeling that I'd never get up and do it unless I was on my own.\" </p> <p>Maybe it was trying to hang on to her - for himself and for Jack - that Huston directed Prizzi's Honor in 1985, starring them both. It was the film that began her career. In it she plays Maerose, the mob moll out for revenge; and, as almost everyone observed at the time, it would have been a much better film if it had been about Maerose. She was callous, evil even, but equipped with courage, and a vampiric sense of fun. There was a lewdness there, that derives directly from her unconventional looks and gives a sensuality to everything she does. As one reviewer put it, \"You resented every scene she wasn't in.\" She was rewarded with an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. There are pictures of both her father and Nicholson tearful as she makes her acceptance speech. </p> <p>Another family film followed, The Dead, her father's last film, made just before his death in 1987 and scripted by her brother, Tony. It showed a softer side - lyrical, quiet - and tuned to the ensemble music of the story. It was the directness, the clarity in her acting, the lack of sentimentality that was beginning to distinguish her work and which makes her so very moving. And suddenly directors became more ambitious about using her, suddenly it didn't seem to matter that her striking looks made her difficult to cast.

The diamond-tough exterior, simple self-protection, becomes a form of self-destruction. The Witches and The Addams Family, both family films, merely caricatured her dark looks and witchy beauty, but did nothing to show her substantialness. And then, it was as though her acting career was over as soon as it had begun. She is naturally a more serious actress than the Hollywood world in which she moves allows her to be. In England, she would have been playing Lady Macbeth, Gertrude, Tamora Queen of the Goths from Titus Andronicus, those \"middle-aged\" roles, but there's no obvious place in American movies for an actress of her maturity and range. And the few there are go to Meryl Streep. And if you aren't in movies in America, as an actress you are nowhere. Last year, Huston was back to playing opposite Jack Nicholson in Sean Penn's The Crossing Guard, in which they play divorcees. </p> <p>She left Nicholson in 1990, after his relationship with the waitress Rebecca Broussard produced a child. I remember interviewing him about four years after this - the wistfulness with which he talked of Anjelica and their relationship. \"She betrayed me first,\" he said, and I had the strong impression that he regretted the split. She thinks so, too. \"I don't think Jack wanted things to change. I think he was kidding himself, but he wasn't kidding me. There was no possibility that I would stay with him after he got someone pregnant.\" There was a \"potent\" conversation, she says, in which she asked him: \"Are you going to be a father to the child?\" And he answered Yes, he was going to be a father to the child. And that was that. You have to listen to this question and remember that it is being asked by someone who, as a child, scarcely had a father. A father who was felt by his absence. And, it is being asked by someone whose mother left her husband, when he made his mistress pregnant. As Anjelica says, \"This was the ultimate betrayal. If he thought I would stay after that...\" </p> <p>He didn't think she would stay. He also probably knew that she had to go - as she says, she would never achieve anything until she was on her own. All her life had been dominated by this fantasy figure, her father. Maybe she had thought that Jack would be a way of sorting out the thing with her father, that he would stand between her and her father. Whatever, there was clear admiration between the two men. Anjelica and Nicholson split up the year after Huston died. John Huston adored Jack. \"Yes,\" she says, \"and rightly so.\" And Jack adored her father? \"Yes.\" </p> <p> Iasked her if the two men were alike. Actually, she said, \"Jack is more like my mother. Physical in the same way, the same grounded feel - feet on the earth. He is emotional, extremely intelligent, has a loony sense of humour. Is brilliant, special, beautiful, luminous. Like her. An old soul.\" It sounds soft, but I still think he let her go. </p> <p>She looks happy. That's because she is happy, she says. She directed her new film, Agnes Brown, in which she also plays the lead and which she describes as \"a lovely fairy-tale\". \"Sweet-natured and uncynical\", just like the remembered Ireland of her childhood. In the film, which opens next month, she plays a mother of seven, a portrait she modelled on her own nanny. Agnes's husband dies suddenly and she works on a stall to support her children while trying to hang on to some sense of self. Huston is always sensual, and in this you feel you can almost touch her. But it's a hopelessly sentimentalised vision of Irish working-class life, full of raven-haired Irish women of flinty resolve. She describes it as \"sort of Snow White with the children as the seven dwarfs\". Which is funny because, in that story, natural casting would have her as the wicked stepmother. Far more complex, mysterious, full of hidden drives than the dreary Snow White. </p> <p>But this is where this story would have ended - Anjelica happy ever after, with her husband, the sculptor Robert Graham, whom she met six months after she left Jack and married one year later. \"He is fantastic. Deep, kind, understanding, a wonderful artist.\" They have no children, and now, most likely, will not have. But that's all right she says. \"It's no big regret. I can have other people's children.\" </p> <p>In the taxi on the way to the airport, the Dublin driver is bemoaning the rising house prices. Sure, no one can afford to buy anything any more, he says.

      "bodyText": "Maybe inheritance inhibits you. If you want to be an actress it looks like beneficence to have a legendary film director as a father; and simple to ease yourself into the Hollywood echelons when you've played skittles with Brando and Scrabble with Mitchum. In fact, Anjelica Huston was 35 when, in 1985, she played her first significant screen role - in Prizzi's Honor, directed, of course, by her dad, John Huston, and starring her lover, Jack Nicholson. Everyone who meets her remarks on it, and it is true, that in the flesh Anjelica Huston is much gentler than you might expect. She is not the person her commanding screen presence suggests. Today, in the natural light of a damp Dublin afternoon, any solidity in the angled planes of her face, the big eyes, the proud nose, dissolves. She is animated, beautiful, feminine, direct. No evasiveness here. She speaks slowly, in a gravelly voice you might assume was the hallmark of 30-odd years of chain smoking - were it not that she is John Huston's daughter. She is dressed to perfection, no creases, in leather trousers, silk shirt. On her fingers are three rings, all cabochon emeralds, and one in particular, surrounded by rubies, commands the attention. She has slim white hands. There exudes from her an aura... of what? Call it wealth, money. Jack Nicholson once designated it \"class\", suggesting something innate in her, and this is probably right. But still there is no doubt that Ms Huston, in her life, has benefited from having every material want supplied. They are fascinating, these people, living their cotton-wool lives - stepping out of their perfumed bath, into their La Perla lingerie, picking up their Vuitton luggage. And how we need them and their fairy-tale existences. Until we realise, that is, that the fairy-tale can be picked apart as easily as even the best-made coat. And no matter how hard one tries, it can't be put back together again, or not in the same shape. We are talking about her life, 48 years. We'll never get through it, I say, not in the allotted time. No matter, she says. \"Make it up. But give it a happy ending. That's all I've ever wanted... Someone to say, 'And she lived happily ever after.' \" This is where it all begins, I think, with a middle-aged man's fantasy. John Huston, remember, directed his first film, The Maltese Falcon in 1941, aged 35 - he had to wait some time for his success. By then he was already three times married, no children. Anyway, John Huston, aged 43 in 1949, meets the beautiful Balanchine ballet dancer Enrica Soma, known as Ricky, aged 17. One year later, now married, they have a son, Anthony. The following year, 1951, while he is shooting The African Queen with Bogart and Hepburn, a daughter, Anjelica. It is two years after Anjelica's birth, while they are still living in California, that John Huston is invited \"on a hunting trip\" in Ireland - he had been in France shooting Moulin Rouge. \"He fell in love with Ireland,\" Anjelica says, \"and he felt that this was where he wanted to raise his children.\" It sounds great, until you realise that Huston intends to continue his life, a continent apart, in America. In 1954, after a year's renting in Co Wicklow, Huston buys a house, St Clarans, a grand, conspicuously remote Georgian manor just outside Co Galway. Ricky, now 21, and the children, retire to the country. And in this dreamy landscape, this fairy-tale scene - complete with dogs and horses and grooms - and bathed in granular light, because no one really believes this is paradise, they grow up. Or maybe \"grow up\" is a bit lazy here. In reality, they all atrophy, awaiting the return of the prodigal patriarch. \"My father would come for three weeks to a month at Christmas from wherever he had been on location, with all sorts of hampers of precious stones, or kimonos from Japan, or wonderful painted dolls and extraordinary Spanish dancing dresses. And he was like a god. He'd call me honey and darling and my little girl and the house would light up and really interesting people would come bearing gifts from America and we were very spoilt. And then he would leave and everything would fall back into shadow.\" For the kids, he was Santa Claus - he came but once a year. But for Ricky, this intimation of \"real\" life must have been torment. \"She loved him,\" Anjelica says. \"He was a big presence, and when he was around the rest of the world simply stopped. My mother followed him as much as she could for a while until it became untenable.\" You have to ask what was Huston up to. He had married Ricky, not much more than a child herself, and banished her from his reality - Hollywood. And put her and their children in a doll's house, filled up with exotic objects. \"They both had very good taste. It was a great mixture of beautiful things.\" He turned his marriage, his family, into a fantasy he could visit occasionally. \"I think he tried to hide her away. She was the mother of his children, and that was probably her place, at that time, in his estimation.\" For Ricky, Anjelica says, \"her life was my father\". Sure, they all missed him. \"Terribly.\" But for her mother, it was particularly lonely. \"She was very young, she was very, very beautiful.\" There was no social life for her in rural Ireland. \"I think it must have been painful for her.\" In 1962, when Anjelica was 11, her mother suddenly left St Clarans for good. Just picked up her bags and departed. She took her two children to London, lived for one year with her friends, the poet Stephen Spender, his wife Natasha and their family, and finally negotiated to buy a house in Little Venice. The children were given no explanation. \"Just vague things. The education. It's time you saw the outside world.\" I asked Anjelica what she now thought had prompted this decision, and she replied that she didn't really know. She didn't know who precipitated the break. What she didn't say is that that same year Huston's mistress, Zoe Sallis, gave birth to a boy, Danny. London was a kind of initiation rite. \"I was very backward, naive, uncynical. One year in London changed all that.\" She recalls on one occasion crying. Asking her mum why they weren't in Ireland any more. Why she wasn't with their father any more. \"And she explained that people grow apart.\" Then follows that odd thing where grown ups are allowed to behave as irresponsibly and as ludicrously as their desires dictate. And children aren't. Throughout her adolescence Anjelica avoided her father. In truth, he wasn't that difficult to avoid. As she explains, he was \"a rare visitor\" to their home, even rarer than before. At this age she was scared of him, he disapproved of everything. \"My father was an odd dichotomy of adventurous, racy, a hunter in every sense - and extremely conservative when it came to his family, and particularly to his daughter.\" She was as she characterises herself, \"A wild child.\" Smoking dope, wandering the streets of Notting Hill, all in black - \"black clothes, black make-up, black wellington boots\". Shiftless, restless. Moving from school to school. At the French Lyc\u00e9e, she was kept down for two years, \"and they were threatening to keep me back for a third\". She was unhappy, began to get ill, she broke one of her vertebrae in an accident. Her mother moved her to a small crammer in Hampstead called Town &amp; Country, and later on to Holland Park Comprehensive. She had dreams of becoming an actress, something her father had always frowned upon. Ricky, meanwhile, was having an affair with a married man. \"She wanted to get remarried. I don't think it made her happy.\" This relationship produced, in 1964, a daughter, Allegra. Anjelica was 13. And this is the misery of it. There wasn't enough time for the usual rites of passage - to resent the child, and then to get used to her. To fight for her mother's attention. Something was about to happen that would change everything. Come 1968, it must have been apparent to her parents that she wasn't going to stick it at school. That year she auditioned for the part of Juliet in Franco Zeffirelli's Romeo And Juliet and was immediately recalled by the director. Then, out of the blue, her father, who had always discouraged her from an acting career, offered her a lead part in his film, A Walk With Love And Death, a 15th- century romance with Moshe Dyan's son as her co-star, supposed to be filming in Paris. Anjelica wasn't allowed to refuse - which effectively blocked any chance of her being considered for the Zeffirelli. Years after, in an interview with Sofia Coppola, Anjelica recalled how much she resented her father's interference at this point. \"My father placed me in a film that I didn't want to do.\" How to interpret Huston's action? Protectiveness? Jealousy more like. Anjelica recalls going shopping with her mother. \"We had to find something for me to wear of which my father would approve. I remember we chose a yellow wool suit.\" The film was a disaster. The May revolution in Paris meant that the location had to be swapped to Vienna. Anjelica was still avoiding her father - not so easy when he is, as she points out, \"the director\". She didn't learn her lines. \"He dressed me down in front of the crew. I was hysterical and embarrassed.\" She was mercilessly panned by the critics. But the experience crystallised one thing for her. One day she was going to be an actress. She'd prove that to her father. \"School, the A-level thing, was water under the bridge.\" Back in London, Ricky got her a part understudying Marianne Faithfull in her friend Tony Richardson's production of Hamlet. Anjelica immediately started work. From the painstaking way she goes over this part of the story, I can only imagine how many times she has rehearsed it, looking for that link that was missed, that may perhaps have changed the whole picture. How do you make sense of your mother's premature death? You go to sleep one night, innocently imagining, if you think about it at all, that she is on her way to Venice with her exciting new young lover. And Anjelica slept well that night, she felt happy. The evening before leaving on her trip, her mother had come to her, \"she wanted to borrow some trashy magazines I had in my room\". She told her daughter that things would have to change between them. \"We are two women now living in the same house. We are going to have to be more honest with each other. You're going to want to know more about what's going on with me.\" It was a great talk, Anjelica says. \"A really fantastic talk. We hugged and kissed and cried. Thank God I had it.\" The next morning, her mother left. And the following morning Anjelica was woken by Allegra's godfather to be told that her mother had been killed in Strasbourg in a car crash. \"Are you awake? Your mother is dead.\" There is no gentle way. As she says, \"The most brutal thing that ever happened to me.\" I suppose after this degree of shock you become a kind of somnambulist, a sleepwalker. It takes a lot to wake you up after something like this. She didn't want to stay in the house surrounded by her mother's things. \"My mother's smell, my mother's closet.\" She didn't want to see her brother, \"look into his eyes\". And she didn't want to see her father. Not that he was there. Huston was in Rome shooting The Bible. He sent his assistant \"to pack up a lot of items\" and subsequently met Anjelica and her brother at Victoria Station - his emphysema meant he couldn't fly. \"We didn't discuss my mother's death. We didn't discuss anything.\" She says she was afraid at this time of what her father would do, \"That he might put me in a convent or something. I just wanted to get as far away as possible.\" Hamlet was about to open on Broadway and Tony Richardson offered to take her with the production. And little Allegra, only four when her mother died? She went to live with her godfather, then with her grandparents. \"Ultimately, my father adopted her.\" That was noble of him, I say, for want of something more adequate. \"My father was a Leo, a big lion,\" she says. \"It's true, he was a warrior. Very brave, courageous. He was a noble man.\" Was he, though? Or is this just another bit of the fairy-tale? It is true that, in every interview she gives, Anjelica Huston eulogises her father. \"I have always been proud of my father. He was unusual and special and he had that voice and his presence was very big. He lit up a room when he walked into it.\" It is also true that he broke her mother's heart - her words. And his own heart? \"No,\" she says flatly. And then: \"I can't say that her death didn't break his heart on some level. He kept the house. St Clarans was there for years, long into the 70s.\" He only sold it after he remarried, for the fifth time. \"I don't think his new wife wanted to be there. It was damp and cold.\" Damp and cold and empty. The next part of the story has an eerie predictability about it. She wanted to be her own agent, free now to make decisions about her life. \"I wanted to be free.\" She wanted to work, and started modelling. That was easy, she was John Huston's daughter - a good provenance - and she has a great face. Andy Warhol's Interview magazine, Harper's Bazaar, Vogue - all queued up. Maybe it was a lazy decision, but she was entitled to be lazy, she can't have had the energy for anything else. And then, she walked straight into the arms of fashion photographer Bob Richardson. They were the identical ages that her parents had been when they met. Richardson, 42, Huston, 18. And, of course, her father loathed him. Richardson had a reputation. \"He was volatile, problematic, manic depressive. My father didn't like the idea of his daughter with a man with that history.\" Unlike her father, he had no money; she kept him. They lived in the Chelsea Hotel in New York when it was on its uppers - \"Got mugged in our room.\" Four years later, her father invited them on to his yacht in Mexico. \"It was meant to be a rapprochement.\" But it was, she says, the holiday from hell and ended with her leaving Richardson at Los Angeles airport. And Los Angeles is where she remained, because it is at this point she went to live with her father. Having never known him or lived with him as a child, in a kind of inversion of reality, she now met him as an adult. It was her father - she called him dad, \"never daddy\" - who introduced her to Jack Nicholson. It would be, wouldn't it? You can see exactly why her father would like him - Nicholson so charismatic, powerful, a man like himself who had come to success late and entirely through his own talent. It was 1972-73 and Nicholson was moving towards the height of his powers. He had made Easy Rider, Five Easy Pieces, the sort of independent films that Huston would admire and the two men were now working together on Roman Polanski's Chinatown. Huston was playing Noah Cross, the demonic father who has an incestuous relationship with his daughter; Nicholson, the private eye Jake Gittes. There is a disquieting scene, in the film in which the two men lock horns over Cross's daughter - played by Faye Dunaway. The dialogue runs something like this. Cross/Huston: Are you sleeping with my daughter? Gittes/Nicholson: If you want an answer to that question I'll put one of my men on it. Cross: You are dealing with a disturbed woman who has just lost her husband . . . Of course the script is Bob Towne's and Polanski's, but it's hard not to feel a shiver of distaste at the real-life parallel. Anjelica moved in with Jack in 1973, when she was 22, and they remained together for 17 years. For the first seven years she worked hardly at all - just walk-ons - a bit part in Kazan's The Last Tycoon, or tiny cameos in films such as The Postman Always Rings Twice, in which Nicholson starred. As she approached 30, almost over the hill in terms of a romantic lead, she had no reputation of her own. Who was she? She was the daughter of a legend and the live-in girlfriend of the most successful actor in Hollywood. Then, in 1980, she moved out, \"ran off\" with the actor Ryan O'Neal. The affair lasted 18 months - he was a pretty boy, but not much more. As she quaintly puts it, \"The problem with Ryan was that, although horizontally everything was lovely, vertically we didn't get along.\" Nicholson, \"took it very badly\". But then, as she also says, \"Jack isn't the most faithful of people. Fidelity is not his strong point. Living with him, I wasn't getting the affection I wanted, the attention I needed.\" Though she and Nicholson got back together, she never moved in with him again. It was now the early 80s, and still she was getting no work. \"I felt like an appendage and I am not much of an appendage person. When the phone rang, it was always for Jack. It was his life I was living. I was not living my own life.\" She was envious of his career. \"Extremely.\" Here she was suspended between these two powerful men. She knew it. \"I wanted a career and I had this strong feeling that I'd never get up and do it unless I was on my own.\" Maybe it was trying to hang on to her - for himself and for Jack - that Huston directed Prizzi's Honor in 1985, starring them both. It was the film that began her career. In it she plays Maerose, the mob moll out for revenge; and, as almost everyone observed at the time, it would have been a much better film if it had been about Maerose. She was callous, evil even, but equipped with courage, and a vampiric sense of fun. There was a lewdness there, that derives directly from her unconventional looks and gives a sensuality to everything she does. As one reviewer put it, \"You resented every scene she wasn't in.\" She was rewarded with an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. There are pictures of both her father and Nicholson tearful as she makes her acceptance speech. Another family film followed, The Dead, her father's last film, made just before his death in 1987 and scripted by her brother, Tony. It showed a softer side - lyrical, quiet - and tuned to the ensemble music of the story. It was the directness, the clarity in her acting, the lack of sentimentality that was beginning to distinguish her work and which makes her so very moving. And suddenly directors became more ambitious about using her, suddenly it didn't seem to matter that her striking looks made her difficult to cast. Woody Allen was the first - he showed her flinty-plain, unequivocal and unafraid as the mistress who is murdered in Crimes And Misdemeanours (1989). She was tough as nails as Lily in Stephen Frears' The Grifters (1990), opposite an emotionally plump John Cusack, balancing maternal instincts against survival - and allowing survival, tragically, to triumph. The diamond-tough exterior, simple self-protection, becomes a form of self-destruction. The Witches and The Addams Family, both family films, merely caricatured her dark looks and witchy beauty, but did nothing to show her substantialness. And then, it was as though her acting career was over as soon as it had begun. She is naturally a more serious actress than the Hollywood world in which she moves allows her to be. In England, she would have been playing Lady Macbeth, Gertrude, Tamora Queen of the Goths from Titus Andronicus, those \"middle-aged\" roles, but there's no obvious place in American movies for an actress of her maturity and range.

The plaintiff is David Irving, pre-eminent historian of the Third Reich or respectable face of international extremism, depending who you ask.

He has nothing - no tenured professor's job to feed his young family, he protests, no pension - while Lipstadt enjoys the financial support of several affluent Jews. To the plaintiff this is further evidence of that hoary anti-semitic notion, a world Jewish conspiracy - in general and to silence him in particular. To those rooting for the defence, it is proof of the moral gravity of this trial: the Jewish people is uniting to defend the truth of its experience. They could not save their fellow Jews 60 years ago: now they will at least save their memory. </p> <p><strong> Shocking images</strong><br> </p> <p> Irving insists he is not a denier of the Holocaust outright. He admits that some Jews were treated badly by the Nazis and that quite a few died. Beyond that, he says, he is not a Holocaust historian and the subject \"bores\" him. His real specialism is Adolf Hitler. Nevertheless, he reckons he knows enough to deny three key, defining aspects of the Holocaust: first, that Jews were killed in gas chambers at Auschwitz, second, that Hitler directly ordered their slaughter and third that there was any systematic plan to destroy European Jewry. The defence will have to prove Irving wrong. Not to a jury - both sides agreed to dispense with that - but to the satisfaction of Charles Gray, former libel lawyer and now high court judge. </p> <p>You would think that would be a simple enough task. We've all seen the archive footage of the camps, the shocking images of human skeletons bulldozed into pits. Surely that evidence settles the matter? Not quite. For Irving looks at those bodies and sees the victims of typhus, an epidemic that thrived in what he admits were the \"ghastly\" conditions of the concentration camps. He claims these victims were not gassed, but died of \"natural causes.\" </p> <p>What of the countless volumes of testimony provided by the survivors of the Holocaust, the Primo Levis, Elie Weisels and Hugo Gryns who, along with thousands of others, described the same, deathly process? They all witnessed the train rides that ended in \"selection,\" with those deemed unfit to work herded away for \"delousing,\" into showers that proved to be gas chambers. What of them? No, Irving would say, the Jews have made it all up. Either these accounts are \"a matter for psychiatric evaluation\" - the witnesses were out of their minds - or the more sinister fruit of a worldwide Jewish plot to guilt-trip the human race. </p> <p>So the defence offers the evidence of the Nazi themselves. On Wednesday, Rampton raised Hans Almeyer, the second highest-ranking Nazi officer at Auschwitz. In his interrogation by British intelligence Almeyer, too, corroborated the witnesses' account of the extermination process. </p> <p>But that is not good enough for Irving either. \"British Army officers ... had ways of making people talk,\" the plaintiff said, happily reversing the clich\u00e9. If a Nazi confesses to the Holocaust then, according to Irving, his words were obviously beaten out of him. They are worthless. </p> <p>That leaves two types of evidence, physical and documentary. Physical evidence is hard, since the Nazis took great pains to destroy the death camps - completely in the case of Treblinka, Chelmno and So bibor - or at least to detonate the gas chambers, as they did at Auschwitz. The ones there are intact, but their ceilings have collapsed, allowing Irving to deny their purpose. Since we cannot see them, cannot examine the ceiling holes through which the gas seeped, we cannot prove they were what thousands of witnesses said they were. </p> <p>All that remains are the documents. Here Irving, acknowledged as a near-obsessive student of Nazi paperwork, takes over. This week he took great delight in cross-examining Robert Jan van Pelt, a Dutch architectural historian who is an authority on the gas chambers. Van Pelt's testimony was crucial to the defence, because he has studied architects' drawings - recently made available - which leave little doubt as to the chambers' function. </p> <p>Irving grilled van Pelt on one document in particular, questioning its authenticity. He rattled off questions: about a serial number out of sequence, an incorrect rank for the signing officer, the initials of the typist (which Irving said exist on no other document), even the precise location of the margin. All these discrepancies, bragged Irving, suggested a forgery. </p> <p>This is where Irving is happiest, rolling around in swastika-embossed paper. He knows these documents so well, he knows their mannerisms. On this terrain, Irving can be frighteningly convincing. </p> <p>It is left to the defence to prove that, despite Irving's intimacy with the Nazi paper mountain, he has deliberately ignored the bits that don't fit his thesis. So they present rebutting documents, an endless supply of them. But Irving either rubbishes these as forgeries or insists he has never seen them. That way he can't be accused of suppressing or distorting them, as Lipstadt wrote. This results in the bizarre spectacle, repeated this week, of Irving claiming never to have read books he owns, even books he has discussed and criticised in public. If occasionally he is forced to admit he has read an authentic document which contradicts his \"revisionism\" entirely, he simply pleads an innocent, historian's mistake. </p> <p>The Lipstadt team must prove otherwise: that Irving is a man with an agenda, a motive. To that end, Rampton spent much of this week confronting the plaintiff with his own words, building up a portrait of what he called a \"perverted racist.\" </p> <p>There was the headline-grabbing ditty Irving sang to his nine-month old daughter: \"I am a baby Aryan/not Jewish or sectarian/I have no plans to marry an/Ape or Rastafarian.\" There was his wish that Trevor McDonald be confined to reading news of drugs busts and muggings, his reflections on God using Aids as \"a Final Solution\" to wipe out \"the blacks and homosexuals.\" The court listens to all this, the Jewish students and pensioners in the public gallery staring straight ahead, the occasional Irvingite letting out a laugh at one of their hero's racist excuses for a joke. </p> <p>In diary entries, video tapes and speech transcripts the evidence has been overwhelming: Irving is a man who regards black people as a different \"species\" and describes Jews as \"the traditional enemies of the truth,\" a people whose elderly would tattoo their own arms in order to make a few bucks in compensation. </p> <p>Irving tries to slip out of all this, too. An anti-semitic comment is not really that, he says: it's just what he imagines an anti-semite might say. At one point, he explained away a long rant against the Jews as his attempt to put \"himself in the skin\" of a Jew-hater. Not him, you understand. </p> <p><strong> Dismisses evidence</strong><br> </p> <p> The overall effect is maddeningly frustrating. \"I'm hacked off,\" sighed Rampton, tugging off his barrister's wig at the end of a long afternoon's questioning. Wrestling with an opponent who will not recognise the prejudice in a phrase like \"hideous Jewish face\" had finally pushed Rampton, who cultivates a manner of curmudgeonly irascibility, into a foul mood. </p> <p>The trouble with Irving is that he refuses to accept the basic rules of evidence. Show him a videotape of a Florida rally by the far right National Alliance, and he'll deny he's ever heard of the organisation - even though the court can see their banner hanging in the very room where Irving was speaking. Irving carries on regardless - denying, denying, denying. </p> <p>This is how he approaches the entire topic. He dismisses the evidence of the witnesses' own eyes: whether Jew or Nazi, they made it all up. He sets a standard of proof for his enemies which no human event could ever fully satisfy. And this is a challenge not only to Deborah Lipstadt. </p> <p>As Martin Gilbert, Churchill biographer and Holocaust historian, who has sat in on the trial throughout, puts it: \"It's not every day that history itself gets its day in court.\" He's right. It is history itself which is on trial here, the whole business of drawing conclusions from evidence. If Irving is able to dismiss the testimony of tens of thousands of witnesses, where does that leave history? If we can't know this, how can we know that Napoleon fought at Waterloo or that Henry VIII had six wives? How can we know anything? </p> <p>This is a challenge to the law. For if witness evidence is always unreliable, where does that leave the courts or justice? But it is also a challenge to us. If we start to doubt corroborated facts, how can we prevent ourselves being swallowed up in doubt, unable to trust anything we see? It might all be a conspiracy, a legend, a hoax. This is the bizarre, never-never world inhabited by David Irving. Now the court has to decide: is this our world too?</p>",

Yet here, everyday from 10.30 till 4, the talk is dark and ancient: of 3,000 years of suffering and of the greatest crime in human history. For Britain's high court is witnessing a trial like no other. In court 73, from now until mid-April at the earliest, truth itself is on trial. Officially, the defendant is the American academic Deborah Lipstadt and her publisher, Penguin Books. The plaintiff is David Irving, pre-eminent historian of the Third Reich or respectable face of international extremism, depending who you ask. He is fighting a one-man libel action against Lipstadt, over her 1993 book Denying the Holocaust, in which she branded Irving \"one of the most dangerous\" of the men who call themselves \"revisionists.\" \"Familiar with historical evidence,\" she wrote, \"he bends it until it conforms with his ideological leanings and political agenda.\" He says that is not only a slur on his reputation; it is also untrue. The result is a daily performance of extraordinary theatre. Moved to one of the high court's largest rooms to accommodate the press and public, Lipstadt sits surrounded by a team of 11, among them solicitor Anthony Julius - who won fame as the divorce lawyer to Princess Diana - and barrister Richard Rampton. Their opponent sits alone. David Irving, florid in pinstripe suit and bouffant hair, has a PC for company but no-one else. He is acting for himself, a struggle, he likes to believe, of the English David against the Goliath of world Jewry. He has nothing - no tenured professor's job to feed his young family, he protests, no pension - while Lipstadt enjoys the financial support of several affluent Jews.

      "body": "<p>Much has changed on the isle of Eigg since my last visit. Fourteen years ago, this tiny Hebridean island, 8km long and 5km wide, had been under the ownership of an eccentric millionaire whose patriarchal attitude towards land administration had won him few friends among the islanders. They held even less admiration for the next landlord, a German businessman who visited the island twice and did nothing to pull it out of a spiral of environmental and social decline. </p> <p>Then in June 1997, the 78 inhabitants of Eigg made history by buying the island themselves. Having successfully raised \u00a3800,000 with the help of the Scottish Wildlife Trust and the Highland Council, the Eiggites are now masters of their own affairs, working as crofters, preserving the environmental balance and running the island's tourist industry. They have even built a tea-room, shop and community centre by the harbour, something the old Eigg never came close to having. </p> <p>Eigg will always have a dose of discord threatening its tranquillity, however. While the neighbouring island of Muck - less than half the size of Eigg and with a population of 20 - has an air of calm and respectability with its quaint tea-rooms and working farms, Eigg is more anarchic. The islanders find it hard to remember how much they're meant to charge you for the rental of their cottages and one can only imagine how they feel when they hand over money to the people of Muck for organic vegetables they could surely grow themselves. </p> <p>But despite their laissez-faire attitude, the Eiggites have succeeded in making the island far more welcoming to visitors than it once was. The bothies, - sturdy stone houses with one room and no electricity that are available for weekly rental - had fallen into decline pre-June 1997. Now all the bothies boast that most basic of luxuries, as well as new roofs, hot water through Calor gas heaters, and huge fireplaces that make these old stone structures the cosiest places you could hope to be in. </p> <p>It is the foreboding pitchstone ridge that is the Sgirr that dominates the island's landscape. At first appearance, this jagged rock looks impossible to conquer, but a two-hour walk along its length takes you past its sheer faces to a point at its back, where a hard but manageable scramble over rocks leads to the grassy verge at the top of the Sgirr, 1,000ft above sea level and with an incredible view that takes in the neighbouring islands of Rum, Muck and Canna. </p> <p>Eigg has a wild, uncontrollable nature, reflected in the diversity of its landscape. Much of it is heather moorland traversed by wet seepages, rocky crags, and scores of timid sheep, but there are also open fields and lichen-encrusted forests, and this, along with a temperate climate, accounts for the variety of the wildlife found here. There are golden eagles that nest within the crevices of the Sgirr, corncrakes in the forest and seals and otters along the shores. </p> <p>The wildness of the island is reflected in the turbulent history of its human population, which dates back to the early 7th century when the Pictish saint St Donnan brought a Christian population to Eigg and founded a monastery, only to be slaughtered along with 52 others by the warrior women of the Pagan queen of Moidart. In the early 16th century, the entire population - 395 members of the Celtic MacDonald clan - were suffocated by the MacLeod clan, who lit a fire at the mouth the cave where the MacDonalds were hiding. In 1588, there was another massacre, when Maclean of Duart raided and pillaged the small isles of the Hebrides with the help of sailors from the Spanish Armada. </p> <p> The events of recent decades, with the islanders negotiating development grants and becoming embroiled in legal manoeuvres, are somewhat pedestrian in comparison. Now that the Eiggites are in charge of their island's administration, a new confidence is coming to Eigg, but there's no danger of the islanders becoming too businesslike. When I enquired of the Lodge, the beautiful 1920s country house that has served as home to a series of landlords and now stands empty, I was told: \"Oh, that old thing. We really must get round to doing something about it sooner or later.\" </p> <p><strong> The practicals</strong><br> For details of accomodation on Eigg, or general information, call Mairi Kirk on 01687 482416. Eigg is reached from the mainland by ferry from Mallaig or Arisaig, which can be reached by coach or train from Fort William. Caledonian Macbraine runs a scheduled ferry from Eigg five times a week. Murdo Grant runs the Shearwater ferry daily, except Thursdays, from Arisaig to Eigg, as well as cruises to Muck and Rum with time ashore (01687 450224).<br> Eigg website: <a href=\"http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/EiggTrust/homepage.htm\">EiggTrust/homepage.htm</a></p>",

Having successfully raised \u00a3800,000 with the help of the Scottish Wildlife Trust and the Highland Council, the Eiggites are now masters of their own affairs, working as crofters, preserving the environmental balance and running the island's tourist industry. They have even built a tea-room, shop and community centre by the harbour, something the old Eigg never came close to having. Eigg will always have a dose of discord threatening its tranquillity, however. While the neighbouring island of Muck - less than half the size of Eigg and with a population of 20 - has an air of calm and respectability with its quaint tea-rooms and working farms, Eigg is more anarchic. The islanders find it hard to remember how much they're meant to charge you for the rental of their cottages and one can only imagine how they feel when they hand over money to the people of Muck for organic vegetables they could surely grow themselves. But despite their laissez-faire attitude, the Eiggites have succeeded in making the island far more welcoming to visitors than it once was. The bothies, - sturdy stone houses with one room and no electricity that are available for weekly rental - had fallen into decline pre-June 1997. Now all the bothies boast that most basic of luxuries, as well as new roofs, hot water through Calor gas heaters, and huge fireplaces that make these old stone structures the cosiest places you could hope to be in. It is the foreboding pitchstone ridge that is the Sgirr that dominates the island's landscape. At first appearance, this jagged rock looks impossible to conquer, but a two-hour walk along its length takes you past its sheer faces to a point at its back, where a hard but manageable scramble over rocks leads to the grassy verge at the top of the Sgirr, 1,000ft above sea level and with an incredible view that takes in the neighbouring islands of Rum, Muck and Canna. Eigg has a wild, uncontrollable nature, reflected in the diversity of its landscape. Much of it is heather moorland traversed by wet seepages, rocky crags, and scores of timid sheep, but there are also open fields and lichen-encrusted forests, and this, along with a temperate climate, accounts for the variety of the wildlife found here. There are golden eagles that nest within the crevices of the Sgirr, corncrakes in the forest and seals and otters along the shores. The wildness of the island is reflected in the turbulent history of its human population, which dates back to the early 7th century when the Pictish saint St Donnan brought a Christian population to Eigg and founded a monastery, only to be slaughtered along with 52 others by the warrior women of the Pagan queen of Moidart. In the early 16th century, the entire population - 395 members of the Celtic MacDonald clan - were suffocated by the MacLeod clan, who lit a fire at the mouth the cave where the MacDonalds were hiding. In 1588, there was another massacre, when Maclean of Duart raided and pillaged the small isles of the Hebrides with the help of sailors from the Spanish Armada. The events of recent decades, with the islanders negotiating development grants and becoming embroiled in legal manoeuvres, are somewhat pedestrian in comparison. Now that the Eiggites are in charge of their island's administration, a new confidence is coming to Eigg, but there's no danger of the islanders becoming too businesslike. When I enquired of the Lodge, the beautiful 1920s country house that has served as home to a series of landlords and now stands empty, I was told: \"Oh, that old thing. We really must get round to doing something about it sooner or later.\" The practicals For details of accomodation on Eigg, or general information, call Mairi Kirk on 01687 482416. Eigg is reached from the mainland by ferry from Mallaig or Arisaig, which can be reached by coach or train from Fort William. Caledonian Macbraine runs a scheduled ferry from Eigg five times a week. Murdo Grant runs the Shearwater ferry daily, except Thursdays, from Arisaig to Eigg, as well as cruises to Muck and Rum with time ashore (01687 450224). Eigg website: EiggTrust/homepage.htm",

      "bodyText": "US-based relatives of Elian Gonzalez, the boy at the centre of a tug of war with Havana, are outraged by his Cuban grandmother's account of how she playfully bit the 6-year-old's tongue and unzipped his trousers during their recent reunion. \"The family is shocked and disturbed,\" said Armando Gutierrez, a spokesman for the relatives, yesterday. \"That is not a Cuban custom.\" In an interview on Cuban television, the boy's paternal grandmother, Mariela Quintana, said she had \"played jokes\" with the boy during a meeting in Florida last month. Ms Quintana said the boy was reserved at the start of the meeting, so she joked that he might have lost his tongue. \"I took his tongue out of his mouth,\" she said, gesturing with her hand as if she was pulling her own tongue from her mouth. \"I bit it.\" \"I even opened up his zipper,\" she said, making an unzipping gesture. \"I told him, 'Let me see, let me see ... if it has grown.\"' In Cuba, few people found her behaviour strange, but a the channel which broadcast the interview in Miami was flooded with calls from outraged viewers. \"Everyone we have talked to, everyone who saw the tape, thought this was inappropriate behaviour for grandmothers,\" said Maria Lewis, managing editor at Telemundo's WSCV-TV. Uva de Aragon, the assistant director of the Cuban research institute at Florida international university, said Ms Quintana's behaviour might seem odd to people in the US but was probably innocent. \"The way the woman said it on national television shows it wasn't something perverted. She was joking with a little kid, trying to get him to respond, the same as if she were tickling him.\" She said that most Hispanic cultures have a different concept of personal space. Elian, who fled Cuba with his mother, was rescued after clinging to an inner tube for two days, the sole survivor of a shipwreck. His father in Cuba is pressing for his return.",

      "bodyText": "A former auditor of TransTec, the collapsed engineering group founded by the former treasury minister, Geoffrey Robinson, is to testify to department of trade and industry officials investigating allegations of falsified applications for government grants, the Guardian has learned. The accountant - who has not been named - is expected to support the allegations, at least in part. Meanwhile, creditors of the crashed group, owed about \u00a3200m, are to meet in Birmingham on Monday to discuss possible courses of action to protect their position. The gathering will include both creditors and \"creditors of creditors\" - some of whom are on the brink of bankruptcy themselves as a result of TransTec's collapse. This presages the full-blown creditors' meeting to be called by the end of March by receivers Arthur Andersen, who, while positive about the future of those who work for most of TransTec's operating units, are thought to find the outlook for creditors far less certain. Some TransTec creditors are \"feeling bruised\", an Andersens spokesman said. Elsewhere, further details have emerged about one of TransTec's major shareholders, the offshore Ducroire company, which has a 6.1% holding. Ducroire has shifted its offices from Madrid to Grand Canary and gives its chief activity as \"development and selling of real estate\". Ducroire is controlled by a Dutch company, First Britannia Mezzanine, one of whose directors is Keith Harris, the former chief executive of HSBC investment bank. First Britannia is run from a London company, Mezzanine Management, 50% of whose shares are registered to seven companies, all based in a for mer presbytery in Alderney in the Channel Islands. At the peak of TransTec's stock market value, the Ducroire shares were worth some \u00a313.5m. The two independent inspectors who were appointed last month by the trade and industry secretary, Stephen Byers, to report on TransTec's collapse in December are looking into the tangled ownership structure of some shares. Meanwhile, the internal department of trade and industry team examining the allegations relating to government grants is to hear from one of the accountants who conducted external audits on TransTec in the late 1980s. The auditor is no longer working for the same company and does not wish to speak to the media. On Wednesday, the DTI heard from Max Ayriss, the former TransTec accountant who first alleged that grants from the department of trade and industry for technical innovation had been obtained by the company between 1986 and 1988 - in part by submitting invoices which produced inflated totals for spending on DTI-approved objectives. Mr Robinson has denied absolutely Mr Ayriss's claims. Mr Ayriss said, however, that the meeting had been \"constructive and positive\". TransTec collapsed after it emerged the company had, some time after Mr Robinson's departure for government office, concealed a \u00a312m claim against it from car group Ford, and had also hidden the fact it had repaid \u00a38m. \u0095 The United States-based scientific and environmental services group, EA Engineering, said last night that it would be restating its profit figures after \"accounting irregularities\" had come to light. Earnings per share would be reduced by about 14 cents, said the Maryland company.",

      "body": "<p>Who was Thomas Griffiths Wainewright? He often asked the same question himself, and in the end decided \"Nobody\". In a sense he was right: today he's not much more than a shadow flickering through the footnotes to Romantic studies. In his own time, though, he was a remarkable Somebody: a renowned painter and author, and a flamboyant man-about-town, who was also a forger and a murderer. His story sheds an eerie light on the famous names around him: Keats and Hazlitt, Lamb and Clare, Fuseli and Blake. Its combination of high culture and low crime dramatises their fascination with the Self, and with the link between vice and virtue. As a victim and as a villain, let alone as an artist and critic, Wainewright caught the spirit of his age. </p> <p>He was born the year before Keats (1794) in Chiswick. His mother died in childbirth, and when his father disappeared shortly afterwards, he was taken in by his maternal grandfather, Ralph Griffiths. Griffiths was an impressive fellow: the founder, and then for 50 years the editor, of England's first modern literary magazine, the Monthly Review. This made him a reasonable living, but most of his money came from another source. He was the original publisher of Fanny Hill and the proceeds bought a grand mansion on Chiswick High Road: Linden House. </p> <p>Wainewright was raised in Linden House and educated in Greenwich by the famous Classicist Charles Burney (brother of Fanny, and son of the well-known musician), where he discovered a flair for drawing. When the time came for him to enter the wide world, he was apprenticed to established painters: John Linnell (Blake's friend) first, then Thomas Phillips, the society portraitist who is probably best remembered today for his portrait of Byron wearing Albanian national costume. </p> <p>Wainewright didn't get on brilliantly well with Phillips. He thought he was too flattering to his sitters. Which is why, when he painted Byron himself (the picture now hangs in Newstead Abbey) he went out of his way to make him look frankly voluptuous. Indeed, the whole business of painting soon lost its appeal for Waine-wright, so he chucked it in and joined the army. By this time, he had shaken off the stern influence of his grandfather and become the most ostentatious kind of dandy: fancy moustaches, frock coat, spurs. </p> <p>This was largely why the 16th Foot appealed to him: they had a uniform which put Beau Brummell in the shade. But not even this was enough to keep him in the military for long. After a year he gave up the army as well , came back to London, had a nervous breakdown, cured himself by reading Wordsworth's poems, got married and went back to painting, exhibiting at the Royal Academy and elsewhere. This was when he met Blake and others in his circle, and also became close friends with Fuseli, to whose dungeon-apartments under Somerset House he often took his wife's two half-sisters to pose for the \"god of his worship\". </p> <p>His life was glamorous, but expensive. He collected prints; he rented smart rooms in Great Marlborough Street; he gave lavish dinners for the London Magazine set: all things which couldn't easily be financed by the little money he earned as a painter and journalist, or by the interest he received from the small trust fund which had been set up for him by his grandfather. By the early 1820s he was reduced to forging the deeds governing this trust (which he knew was a capital offence), in order to continue on his merry way. </p> <p>When that money was spent, he devised a more desperate remedy. In the late 1820s and early '30s at least three of his nearest and dearest died in highly suspicious circumstances, and as a result of each death Wainewright made large financial gains. He never admitted to murder, but the circumstantial evidence against him is overwhelming, and he is known to have had several books on poison in his library. He was especially interested in strychnine, which had been developed only recently, and could not be reliably detected at autopsy. </p> <p> What seems to have happened is this: first he killed his uncle and inherited the big house out at Chiswick; then he bumped off his mother-in-law to sever his links with her money-grubbing relations; and then he set up a complicated insurance scam with Helen Abercrombie, a half-sister of his wife. The original idea was to fake her death and run away to France with the loot, but things got too complicated. In the end, he poisoned Helen as well. </p> <p>When Wainewright unwisely returned to London in the mid-1830s after five wretched years in France, he was immediately arrested, put in Newgate, where he was visited by Dickens, among others, and tried for forgery. (Not for murder, which was mentioned during his trial but could not be proved.) He was transported to Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania), the most brutal of all the penal colonies. </p> <p>After a gruelling year on the chain gang, Wainewright got back his freedom by degrees: as a hospital orderly, then as someone who was allowed to practice painting again. Many of the local worthies sat for him (about 50 of these elegant portraits survive), but Wainewright never became part of respectable society, even after gaining his ticket-of-leave and, eventually, a conditional pardon. When he died in Hobart in 1847, his body was seized by the hospital and used to demonstrate methods of dissection. He has no grave. </p> <p>It took two years of library-hopping, as well as a visit to Tasmania, to sort out the basic chronology of Wainewright's story. (Though a biography of him had been published in the 1930s, and another in Australia in the '50s). But when I was ready to start writing, it was obvious that certain vital elements had vanished for ever. As his friends learned of his disgrace, they destroyed all evidence of their connection with him: only a handful of his letters survive, and his petition for a ticket of leave. When he disappeared from public records he vanished from the face of the earth. </p> <p>This meant that I was simply not in a position to write a complete orthodox biography, but by now I didn't want to, anyway. Initially, I'd supposed that whatever was experimental about my book would have to do with Wainewright's obscurity. During my research, I realised that I had good reasons for going on a formal adventure as well. I'd been pre- occupied for years by the problems which dog all biographers: how to combine objective views with subjective judg-ments; how to breathe life back into people who don't leave a mass of papers behind them. Maybe, I thought, by allowing Wainewright to tell his own story - by writing his Confessions (19th-century sense) - I could frame these questions in dramatic rather than just theoretical ways. And at the same time I could reveal things about his personality. I could make a virtue of unavoidable ignorance by presenting it as his own plausible evasion. I could suggest things about his devious nature by mingling extracts from his own writing, with others from contemporaries like Lamb and Hazlitt, and embed them all in my own ventriloquising invention. </p> <p>This, I reckoned, would make Wainewright at once elusive and plausible - as he was. But I was still anxious to preserve a reliable kind of control over the material. In order that readers should know what they were dealing with, and to let hard facts emerge clearly, I decided to augment his text with notes which would supply background information, include mini-essays on relevant topics (from print collecting to poisoning), and wherever necessary correct the lies or misinformation in Wainewright's own account. </p> <p>And this is how the book ended up: 21 chapters in which Wainewright tells his story from cradle to (almost) grave, and which purport to have been written in Van Diemen's Land the year before he died. They combine elements we normally associate with novels, prose poems, rants, ravings, self-justifications, the whole caboodle. And at the end of each chapter, there's a parcel of notes which contain the \"orthodox biography\". </p> <p>The book is an experiment. But its mixture of different forms all share a common purpose. They are dedicated to rescuing Waine-wright from obscurity, to enjoying his achievements as an artist and critic, to exploring his career as a criminal, and to investigating his self. The voice that I have given him is a confection, but it is nothing more or less than the one I would have tried to characterise by more conventional means, had I decided to write a more familiar sort of biography. Exactly the same applies to my treatment of his personality. </p> <p>\u0095 To order a copy of Wainewright the Poisoner, by Andrew Motion (Faber, rrp \u00a320) at the discount price of \u00a317 plus 99p UK p&amp;p, freephone 0800 316 6102 or send a cheque, payable to Guardian CultureShop, to 250 Western Avenue, London W3 6EE</p>",

Wainewright didn't get on brilliantly well with Phillips. He thought he was too flattering to his sitters. Which is why, when he painted Byron himself (the picture now hangs in Newstead Abbey) he went out of his way to make him look frankly voluptuous. Indeed, the whole business of painting soon lost its appeal for Waine-wright, so he chucked it in and joined the army. By this time, he had shaken off the stern influence of his grandfather and become the most ostentatious kind of dandy: fancy moustaches, frock coat, spurs. This was largely why the 16th Foot appealed to him: they had a uniform which put Beau Brummell in the shade. But not even this was enough to keep him in the military for long. After a year he gave up the army as well , came back to London, had a nervous breakdown, cured himself by reading Wordsworth's poems, got married and went back to painting, exhibiting at the Royal Academy and elsewhere. This was when he met Blake and others in his circle, and also became close friends with Fuseli, to whose dungeon-apartments under Somerset House he often took his wife's two half-sisters to pose for the \"god of his worship\". His life was glamorous, but expensive. He collected prints; he rented smart rooms in Great Marlborough Street; he gave lavish dinners for the London Magazine set: all things which couldn't easily be financed by the little money he earned as a painter and journalist, or by the interest he received from the small trust fund which had been set up for him by his grandfather. By the early 1820s he was reduced to forging the deeds governing this trust (which he knew was a capital offence), in order to continue on his merry way. When that money was spent, he devised a more desperate remedy. In the late 1820s and early '30s at least three of his nearest and dearest died in highly suspicious circumstances, and as a result of each death Wainewright made large financial gains. He never admitted to murder, but the circumstantial evidence against him is overwhelming, and he is known to have had several books on poison in his library. He was especially interested in strychnine, which had been developed only recently, and could not be reliably detected at autopsy. What seems to have happened is this: first he killed his uncle and inherited the big house out at Chiswick; then he bumped off his mother-in-law to sever his links with her money-grubbing relations; and then he set up a complicated insurance scam with Helen Abercrombie, a half-sister of his wife. The original idea was to fake her death and run away to France with the loot, but things got too complicated. In the end, he poisoned Helen as well. When Wainewright unwisely returned to London in the mid-1830s after five wretched years in France, he was immediately arrested, put in Newgate, where he was visited by Dickens, among others, and tried for forgery. (Not for murder, which was mentioned during his trial but could not be proved.) He was transported to Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania), the most brutal of all the penal colonies. After a gruelling year on the chain gang, Wainewright got back his freedom by degrees: as a hospital orderly, then as someone who was allowed to practice painting again. Many of the local worthies sat for him (about 50 of these elegant portraits survive), but Wainewright never became part of respectable society, even after gaining his ticket-of-leave and, eventually, a conditional pardon. When he died in Hobart in 1847, his body was seized by the hospital and used to demonstrate methods of dissection. He has no grave. It took two years of library-hopping, as well as a visit to Tasmania, to sort out the basic chronology of Wainewright's story. (Though a biography of him had been published in the 1930s, and another in Australia in the '50s). But when I was ready to start writing, it was obvious that certain vital elements had vanished for ever. As his friends learned of his disgrace, they destroyed all evidence of their connection with him: only a handful of his letters survive, and his petition for a ticket of leave. When he disappeared from public records he vanished from the face of the earth. This meant that I was simply not in a position to write a complete orthodox biography, but by now I didn't want to, anyway. Initially, I'd supposed that whatever was experimental about my book would have to do with Wainewright's obscurity. During my research, I realised that I had good reasons for going on a formal adventure as well. I'd been pre- occupied for years by the problems which dog all biographers: how to combine objective views with subjective judg-ments; how to breathe life back into people who don't leave a mass of papers behind them. Maybe, I thought, by allowing Wainewright to tell his own story - by writing his Confessions (19th-century sense) - I could frame these questions in dramatic rather than just theoretical ways. And at the same time I could reveal things about his personality. I could make a virtue of unavoidable ignorance by presenting it as his own plausible evasion. I could suggest things about his devious nature by mingling extracts from his own writing, with others from contemporaries like Lamb and Hazlitt, and embed them all in my own ventriloquising invention. This, I reckoned, would make Wainewright at once elusive and plausible - as he was. But I was still anxious to preserve a reliable kind of control over the material. In order that readers should know what they were dealing with, and to let hard facts emerge clearly, I decided to augment his text with notes which would supply background information, include mini-essays on relevant topics (from print collecting to poisoning), and wherever necessary correct the lies or misinformation in Wainewright's own account. And this is how the book ended up: 21 chapters in which Wainewright tells his story from cradle to (almost) grave, and which purport to have been written in Van Diemen's Land the year before he died. They combine elements we normally associate with novels, prose poems, rants, ravings, self-justifications, the whole caboodle. And at the end of each chapter, there's a parcel of notes which contain the \"orthodox biography\". The book is an experiment. But its mixture of different forms all share a common purpose. They are dedicated to rescuing Waine-wright from obscurity, to enjoying his achievements as an artist and critic, to exploring his career as a criminal, and to investigating his self. The voice that I have given him is a confection, but it is nothing more or less than the one I would have tried to characterise by more conventional means, had I decided to write a more familiar sort of biography. Exactly the same applies to my treatment of his personality. \u0095 To order a copy of Wainewright the Poisoner, by Andrew Motion (Faber, rrp \u00a320) at the discount price of \u00a317 plus 99p UK p&amp;p, freephone 0800 316 6102 or send a cheque, payable to Guardian CultureShop, to 250 Western Avenue, London W3 6EE",

      "body": "<p>January 1900. Henry Wilson, the Arts &amp; Crafts architect, was sitting in his London club when he learned from a fellow member that John Ruskin had died. \"Ruskin is dead?\" he asked, rhetorically. A pause. \"Thank God. Give me a cigarette.\" Stephen Wildman, curator of the Ruskin Library at Lancaster University, tells this story with a somewhat perverted relish. Ruskin bestrode the Victorian worlds of art, architecture, culture, political economy and morality like some supremely elegant, if fiery, colossus. Wildman is a Ruskinite dedicated to conserving the memory of this misunderstood and thoughtlessly maligned genius. Yet his charge was admired and reviled in equal measures. In any case, as everyone in the know knew, the great prophet, seer, critic - what had you - was, for the last decade of his life, mad. His flame had long burned out by the time Henry Wilson lit his celebratory gasper. And yet, curiously, even while metropolitan arty-smarties sneered, Ruskin was being hailed as a champion and prophet by aspiring left-wing politicians and working men up and down the country in institutes and clubs that bore his name. </p> <p>Today, John Ruskin, who died on January 20, 1900, is known, if he is known at all, as champion of Turner, patron of the Pre-Raphaelites, but mostly as the ultra-refined aesthete who proved incapable, for whatever reason, of consummating his ill-starred marriage to Euphemia Chalmers Gray. She was the society beauty who eventually ran off with John Everett - later Sir John - Millais, painter of such sudsy stuff as Bubbles and The Soldier's Farewell. Ruskin is, however, about to be resurrected through a major exhibition of his life and work curated by Stephen Wildman, Robert Hewison and Ian Burrell at the freshly reconstituted Tate Britain on London's Millbank. </p> <p>By the end of this year, Ruskin's name might just become familiar to a generation for whom he means little or nothing. Yet how can anyone get the measure of a man whose hugely influential writings are as obscure today as those of the anonymous authors of the Dead Sea scrolls were until unearthed? But, like those ancient authors, Ruskin, for all his loquaciousness and encyclopaedic breadth of thought, had ultimately one simple and life-affirming message to leave behind him: \"There is no wealth but life,\" he wrote, an aphorism of great simplicity and equal profundity, and crafted with passionate economy by one of the most eminent Victorians of all, one who sought neither fame nor honour. </p> <p>He was admired by Gandhi, Tolstoy and Proust. His ideas on political economy, which gradually became more important to him than his prolific writing on art, became gospel for the Labour Party in Britain between 1900 and 1950; they were put into action by William Beveridge (universal education) and Nye Bevan (a national health service). He was a champion, albeit in a gallant, white-knight-on-a-horse manner, of women's rights. He wrote one of the most inspiring and effective of all political and economic manifestos, Unto This Last, published in book form in 1862. </p> <p>Ruskin's was a complex and massive genius. He was neither an academic nor a specialist, nor wanted to be either. He represented, perhaps, the very last of a generation for whom everything connected - poetry, prose, geology, ancient myths, art, architecture, science, politics - and which was pushed into the shadows by the 20th century's mechanistic need for specialisms and pseudo-sciences. A precursor of the welfare state, and inspiration to liberal socialists around the globe, Ruskin described himself as a \"violent Tory of the old school\". He could be contrary, at once radical and conservative, brilliant and absurd; perhaps this is to be expected of a man who was fundamentally an artist with an eagle's eye, a secular prophet who wrote like an archangel might, if only an archangel could. </p> <p>In our own demeaning new age of deregulation, privatisation, commercial sponsorship, globalisation, of \"brands\", dumbing down, the de-skilling of workforces, private finance initiatives, the rise of a mass, US-inspired culture, our cultural mandarins' obsession with \"accessibility\" (for which read \"bread and circuses\"), Ruskin, who wanted us to aim for the stars, seems unhappily irrelevant. Even so, every squeaky-clean young member of the New Labour government ought to be given a copy of Unto This Last to read - via the net or email, if they find books too old a concept - before they consider legislation brought before them in parliament. </p> <p>They will certainly get to hear something of Ruskin in the coming year as he emerges from behind the cloud of Wilson's cigarette smoke. Every member of Clement Attlee's cabinet in the Labour governments of 1945-51 would have been aware of Ruskin, and most probably have read him, too. </p> <p>Given his colossal influence and intriguing genius, where has Ruskin been this past century - save in the names of south London streets, of a few down-at-heel working-men's clubs in an age when we're all supposed to be middle class, and of that outgrowth of prickly late-Victorian red-brick buildings forever boarded up and due to be replaced any moment by a drive-thru McDonald's or anonymous distribution depot? </p> <p>Ruskin's memory, however, has also lived on in the minds of those who have discovered this extraordinary man and original thinker for themselves. They include the likes of Hewison, Wildman and Warrell, and a core of dedicated Ruskinites harumphing around the globe. My own voyage around this uncategorisable Victorian began as a teenager when walking in the Lake District. I imagined myself following in the footsteps of Coleridge, Wordsworth and Southey, of Hazlitt and De Quincey, when I came across Brantwood, Ruskin's picturesque home on the banks of Coniston Water, without knowing who Ruskin was. Unlike Coleridge and Wordsworth, he wasn't taught at school, and figured neither in my local nor my school libraries. I took Brantwood, with its then overgrown gardens and general state of shabby yet pleasing decay, to be either an old person's home or the sort of windy, rattly house to which Catholic children are sent on retreats by well-meaning priests. </p> <p>Inside, a man in damp tweeds and a beard sold me a red clothbound copy of Unto This Last for 40p. I sat in the slanting, slate chair Ruskin had made for himself beside a stuttering waterfall among the ferns that brushed the forlorn gardens, and read that book from cover to cover. It had been a Johannine conversion on the road to Coniston. Unto This Last explained, in language far greater than that of Wordsworth or Southey, and the equal of Coleridge, how it was possible to reconcile a Christian upbringing with a belief in radical politics, equal opportunities for all and a love of art. Only connect . . . and did Ruskin make the connections. </p> <p>At university, I bought as many second-hand copies of Ruskin's works as my grant would allow, which was ultimately far more than a shelf-full. Wonderful tomes such as The Seven Lamps Of Architecture, The Stones Of Venice and Sesame And The Lilies went for 25, 30, and very occasionally 60 pence in a green George Allen hardback edition. In my third year, I was sold the handsome Cook &amp; Wedderburn library edition of Ruskin for approximately 38 <sup>1</sup>/2 pence a volume (there are 39 of them). The bookseller had just cleared a houseful of unwanted books. Here came that odd undergraduate looking for Ruskin again. Just take them . . . 15 quid the job lot. </p> <p>Just before Christmas last year, I visited Brantwood for the first time in a long while. Lottery grants have seen the house Ruskin bought in 1871 come to life under the care of its knowledgeable and likeable curator, Howard Hull, and the Ruskin Foundation. The gardens promise to blossom healthily this spring, to become again the botanical laboratory Ruskin wanted them to be: he was an early champion of ecology and conservation. Just inside the back door (main entrance for the public; 35,000 visitors a year, with a further 15,000 rambling up and through the steep-sided 250-acre Brantwood estate alone) is a healthily-stocked bookshop. Those green Ruskin editions are on sale today for up to \u00a335 each. A complete set of Cook &amp; Wedderburn goes, I learn, usually in auctions, for upwards of \u00a32,000. A pantheon of biographies has been published over the past decade, Tim Hilton's two-parter perhaps the best. Clearly there are people who value Ruskin - I met a couple of dozen at a Ruskin seminar held in the New Town-style architecture of Lancaster University last December - and each of them appears to have undergone much the same conversion on the road to Coniston as I did. </p> <p> At Brantwood, Ruskin's beginning and end meet. I lay on the bed in the small, fire-lit room in which he died. Beyond the window and across the darkness of the long lake loomed the snow-capped peak of the Old Man of Coniston. Holding his cousin Joan Severn's hand, this was the last sight Ruskin saw - this and floor-to-ceiling, wall-to-wall Turner watercolours (sadly, long since gone). The bedroom he retreated to in the decade of his largely silent madness connected the reality of the Lake peaks with the spirited drama of Turner's Alpine landscapes. </p> <p>It had been as an eloquent defender of Turner's reputation that the young Ruskin made his mark as author of the first volume of Modern Painters in 1843, and began his grand intellectual tour of art, architecture, politics, economics and social welfare. Ruskin was aged 24 then, and only recently down from Christ Church. He had taken more than a year out in the middle of his studies to travel across Europe, by carriage, with his devoted and evangelical parents, John James and Margaret. These two, married late, were first cousins. Scots, they met in Edinburgh. John James went on to make a fortune in the sherry trade as a partner of Ruskin, Telford &amp; Domecq. He bought books and paintings. John - born in Bloomsbury in 1819, and brought up in Herne Hill and Denmark Hill in what was once sylvan south London - was their only son. Margaret hoped he would enter the church and ultimately, so John said, become an archbishop. Always a great preacher - in later life, his lectures on art, life, the universe etc were highly animated and enthusiastically attended - he was to question the orthodoxies of the Christian religion in which he had been so assiduously brought up. His religious doubts were later to contribute to the loss of the love of his life, the young Anglo-Irish evangelical Rose La Touche (1848-1875), which loss led to madness. </p> <p>Ruskin's time off from Oxford was occasioned by the news that his first love, Ad\u00e8le Domecq, one of the three beautiful Parisian daughters of his father's Spanish business partner, had married a rich French count. Rejection hit Ruskin hard. He took love seriously and fell dangerously ill. Yet what was the gorgeous, cosmopolitan Catholic Ad\u00e8le to make of this thin, if handsome, and awkward Protestant intellectual? He must have been as remote to her as later he proved to be to his wife. His sanity and health were ultimately restored through a trip to the Alps - he was to become an eminent amateur geologist, and resorted to sorting rocks and stones whenever unreason or unwanted guests threatened - and then to his beloved Venice. By this time, he had met JMW Turner. The miserly and misanthropic Cockney artist accepted the adulation and generosity of the Oxford-educated dandy, and brought him, at first a little grudgingly, into the extraordinary worlds of his London house in Queen Anne Street - crowded with his \"children\", his own paintings - and of his imagination. Inspired by Turner's watercolours, the Ruskins would travel, as far as their old-fashioned carriage weighed down with improving books allowed, to each and every site, many around Chamonix, where Turner had established his easel. </p> <p>In 1841, John met the young Euphemia Gray, and wrote for her his popular and delightful fairytale, King Of The Golden River. His life was essentially happy at this point. He sat in his study at his parents' grand and well-staffed new house in its own grounds, with cats and dogs, at Denmark Hill and wrote the first volume of Modern Painters, a defence of Turner, comparing his hero to the masters of the Renaissance. The author was \"A Graduate of Oxford\", for Ruskin felt that his youth would prejudice critics. In fact, Modern Painters was well reviewed. The complete work, a magisterial and occasionally baffling incursion into many aspects of art and society, was to cover five volumes and not to be completed until 1860. </p> <p>By this time, Ruskin, always a prodigious and tireless author, had also written his hugely influential and best-selling The Seven Lamps Of Architecture (1849), The Stones Of Venice (first volume, 1851, the year of the Great Exhibition at the Crystal Palace), The Political Economy Of Art and the essays, published in Cornhill Magazine, that formed his greatest book, Unto This Last. In 1844, John James, proud of his son's new reputation as a top-drawer author, bought him Turner's turbulent oil painting Slavers, a 250-guinea New Year's present (this ended up in Princeton, New Jersey, and can be seen here for the first time in a very long while at Tate Britain this spring). The next year, he made his first trip abroad without his parents. He travelled with two varsity pals overland to Venice; characteristically, he was upset by the new railway bridge crossing the lagoon from Mestre to La Serenissima, complaining in a letter to his father that the Grand Canal below Rialto was \"adorned with gas lamps! in grand new iron posts of the last Birmingham fashion\". He was learning to thunder as well as to reason. </p> <p>And then came marriage to Effie Gray. Was it a mistake from the outset, the wealthy and successful young intellectual and author wedded in 1848 to a cute and ambitious Edinburgh society fledgling in need of a fortune? In hindsight, maybe. Ruskin's friend, the Pre-Raphaelite painter, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, described Effie as \"a young, lively party, rather shrewd and rather hard\", and \"snobbish\" to boot. Many years later, Ruskin wrote to Kathleen Olander, a London art student and the last of his loves, \"I may tell you that the girl who bore my name was never my wife - I found two days before the marriage that her father had forced her to take me for my fortune - and I kept separate - thinking that in time she would come to care for me, but she would not - and left me as the world knows.\" </p> <p>The truth is a matter for conjecture. John was always wrapped up in his protean labours, which must have seemed more than strange to the party-loving Effie. On holiday in Venice for the first time together, she wanted to shop - her greatest passions were frocks and jewellery - while John clambered over the front of St Mark's making accurate measurements of the fabulous Byzantine basilica. She shone most of all at Venetian soir\u00e9es, as long as there were plenty of handsome young Austrian army officers to flirt with. At home, for the most part with John's parents in Denmark Hill, she was bored. The marriage lasted six years. There has been much unkind nonsense talked about the Ruskins' honeymoon. All we know for sure is that both John and Effie were sexual innocents. Neither had seen an adult naked before. Effie had her period, and John had a rotten headcold. Whatever didn't happen on their first night naked together, they agreed to try again in three years' time. However odd this seems to us post the Lady Chatterley trial and the Beatles' first LP, they seemed, despite everything (or not quite everything), to be rather happy with one another. </p> <p>John, though, was more married to his work than to Effie, who had nothing much to do. In 1854, they went with the impish and ambitious young painter, John Everett Millais, on what proved to be an ill-fated trip to Scotland. At Glenfinlas falls, Ruskin posed for Millais. The commission, a portrait in oils, was to help establish one of the group of young radical painters, who included Rossetti and Holman-Hunt and who called themselves the Pre-Raphaelites. Not unprofitably, they had chosen Ruskin as their mentor. Ruskin taught Millais much about how to see and how to draw: Millais had eyes only for Effie, with whom he fell in love. His ardour was appreciated. Shortly afterwards, Effie sued for divorce, won on the grounds of non-consummation and her husband's \"impotence\". Effie married Millais the following year. Ruskin was, as his parents knew, rather relieved. He had never really been in love with his wife. Now, he could get back to his work without disturbance. </p> <p>Tragically, the consequences of the divorce came to haunt Ruskin some years later, after he had fallen deeply in love with Rose La Touche. The La Touche parents admired Ruskin and invited him often to their grand home at Harristown in Ireland, and Mrs La T fell rather in love with John, too, as many women did - Kate Greenaway was probably the last - but for her he felt nothing more than friendship. She was herself five or six years younger than Ruskin, and determined to separate the lovers before their relationship went too far. John had, in fact, proposed to Rose in 1866. She was just 18, and said she would give her 47-year-old suitor an answer when she was 21. The long wait caused Ruskin no end of mental anguish. Meanwhile, Mrs La Touche wrote to Effie Millais asking for details of her divorce. </p> <p>By then, Effie was a hardened woman, in love with fame and money, who liked nothing better, says Stephen Wildman, than to attend some of John's lectures with Millais. Spitefully, the money-crazed couple sat in the front row, glaring at the extraordinary man in front of them and hoping, in vain, to put him off his stride. Effie - who knows why? - wrote back to Mrs La Touche, describing her former husband as \"unnatural\". </p> <p>It was an odd business. If Ruskin was indeed potent, was Effie then a bigamist and her many children with Millais technically bastards? Or, from the La Touche perspective, might it also mean that if John produced children with Rose, they would be illegitimate? </p> <p>Ruskin, meanwhile, insisted to his friends that he was far from impotent, that he was in these matters a \"follower of Rousseau\": he masturbated. Where he had not loved Effie, he clearly loved Rose, and not just the idea of her, as unfeeling biographers have suggested: just look at the beautiful drawings he made of her. Mrs La Touche, with help from Mrs Millais, poisoned Rose's troubled mind. Rose rejected John, only to ask for him again and then again over several years as she grew increasingly sick in mind and heart. He rushed to Ireland when she was very ill to cradle her in his arms. She haunted his dreams. He took to painting roses (he was always a very fine painter). Rose died in 1875, and although Ruskin tried even quite late in life to find a romantic young woman to replace her in his heart, he never really did. Rose became the thorn in his side that hurt him to the point where he crossed the border of sanity to escape the pain. </p> <p>Ruskin's problem with women lay partly in the fact that he never met his match. Perhaps as a precocious only child, he was self-absorbed and quietly egotistical. Yet what woman ever really challenged him, or offered back the powerful love he offered them? Year by year, he retreated into a world of ever younger women, the strange \"vice\" of Victorian men of Alician taste. Even so, during these tumultuous years, Ruskin wrote many of his greatest letters, essays and books, gave his greatest lectures, and became one of the truest as well as the greatest radicals of his day. An unlikely revolutionary, his increasing fascination with the workings of society and the political economy, and what he did with that fascination, affects us to this day.</p> <p> Of the four essays that comprise Unto This Last, he wrote, justly, \"I believe them to be the best, that is to say, the truest, rightest-worded, and the most serviceable things I have ever written; and the last of them, having had especial pains spent on it, is probably the best I shall ever write.\" What was so special about Unto This Last? What it did was to set out a \"logical definition of wealth\". Because there is ultimately no wealth but life, he argued the case for universal education \"at government cost\", for the establishment of \"government manufacturies to compete honestly alongside private enterprise\" (ie nationalised industries), for social security for the unemployed, and also provision for their education and training. He argued for the provision of \"comfort and home for the old and destitute\" (state pensions, sheltered housing). These were shocking, even unnatural demands, in laissez- faire, free-trade Britain. The rules of the economy were governed by the self-interest of Adam Smith's entrepreneurs, all working to the laws of supply and demand. Darwin's laws of natural selection, fully developed in The Origin Of The Species (1859), reinforced the message that an unbridled capitalist ordering of society was exactly as Nature intended. </p> <p>Ruskin and Darwin had a great respect for one another, and visited each other's homes at Brantwood and Downe, Surrey. Yet, for Ruskin, the so-called laws of political economy were a clever, unfeeling nonsense. The political economy, argues Ruskin, is not so much a mechanism as an organism: \"Observe, I neither impugn nor doubt the conclusions of the science, if its terms are accepted. I am simply uninterested in them, as I should be in those of a science of gymnastics which assumed that men had no skeletons.\" Modern political economy, he reasoned, assumes \"not that the human being has no skeleton, but that it is all skeleton\", and thus it \"founds an ossifiant theory of progress on this negation of a soul; and having shown the utmost that may be made of bones, and constructed a number of interesting geometric figures with death's-heads and humeri, successfully proves the inconvenience of the reappearance of a soul among these corpuscular structures.\" The theory, then, may be true in its own terms, says Ruskin, but is irrelevant to human life.</p> <p>Continue reading... <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/departments/artsandentertainment/story/0,6000,132685,00.html\">Only connect part 2</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "January 1900. Henry Wilson, the Arts &amp; Crafts architect, was sitting in his London club when he learned from a fellow member that John Ruskin had died. \"Ruskin is dead?\" he asked, rhetorically. A pause. \"Thank God. Give me a cigarette.\" Stephen Wildman, curator of the Ruskin Library at Lancaster University, tells this story with a somewhat perverted relish. Ruskin bestrode the Victorian worlds of art, architecture, culture, political economy and morality like some supremely elegant, if fiery, colossus. Wildman is a Ruskinite dedicated to conserving the memory of this misunderstood and thoughtlessly maligned genius. Yet his charge was admired and reviled in equal measures. In any case, as everyone in the know knew, the great prophet, seer, critic - what had you - was, for the last decade of his life, mad. His flame had long burned out by the time Henry Wilson lit his celebratory gasper. And yet, curiously, even while metropolitan arty-smarties sneered, Ruskin was being hailed as a champion and prophet by aspiring left-wing politicians and working men up and down the country in institutes and clubs that bore his name. Today, John Ruskin, who died on January 20, 1900, is known, if he is known at all, as champion of Turner, patron of the Pre-Raphaelites, but mostly as the ultra-refined aesthete who proved incapable, for whatever reason, of consummating his ill-starred marriage to Euphemia Chalmers Gray. She was the society beauty who eventually ran off with John Everett - later Sir John - Millais, painter of such sudsy stuff as Bubbles and The Soldier's Farewell. Ruskin is, however, about to be resurrected through a major exhibition of his life and work curated by Stephen Wildman, Robert Hewison and Ian Burrell at the freshly reconstituted Tate Britain on London's Millbank. By the end of this year, Ruskin's name might just become familiar to a generation for whom he means little or nothing. Yet how can anyone get the measure of a man whose hugely influential writings are as obscure today as those of the anonymous authors of the Dead Sea scrolls were until unearthed? But, like those ancient authors, Ruskin, for all his loquaciousness and encyclopaedic breadth of thought, had ultimately one simple and life-affirming message to leave behind him: \"There is no wealth but life,\" he wrote, an aphorism of great simplicity and equal profundity, and crafted with passionate economy by one of the most eminent Victorians of all, one who sought neither fame nor honour. He was admired by Gandhi, Tolstoy and Proust. His ideas on political economy, which gradually became more important to him than his prolific writing on art, became gospel for the Labour Party in Britain between 1900 and 1950; they were put into action by William Beveridge (universal education) and Nye Bevan (a national health service). He was a champion, albeit in a gallant, white-knight-on-a-horse manner, of women's rights. He wrote one of the most inspiring and effective of all political and economic manifestos, Unto This Last, published in book form in 1862. Ruskin's was a complex and massive genius. He was neither an academic nor a specialist, nor wanted to be either. He represented, perhaps, the very last of a generation for whom everything connected - poetry, prose, geology, ancient myths, art, architecture, science, politics - and which was pushed into the shadows by the 20th century's mechanistic need for specialisms and pseudo-sciences. A precursor of the welfare state, and inspiration to liberal socialists around the globe, Ruskin described himself as a \"violent Tory of the old school\". He could be contrary, at once radical and conservative, brilliant and absurd; perhaps this is to be expected of a man who was fundamentally an artist with an eagle's eye, a secular prophet who wrote like an archangel might, if only an archangel could. In our own demeaning new age of deregulation, privatisation, commercial sponsorship, globalisation, of \"brands\", dumbing down, the de-skilling of workforces, private finance initiatives, the rise of a mass, US-inspired culture, our cultural mandarins' obsession with \"accessibility\" (for which read \"bread and circuses\"), Ruskin, who wanted us to aim for the stars, seems unhappily irrelevant. Even so, every squeaky-clean young member of the New Labour government ought to be given a copy of Unto This Last to read - via the net or email, if they find books too old a concept - before they consider legislation brought before them in parliament. They will certainly get to hear something of Ruskin in the coming year as he emerges from behind the cloud of Wilson's cigarette smoke. Every member of Clement Attlee's cabinet in the Labour governments of 1945-51 would have been aware of Ruskin, and most probably have read him, too. Given his colossal influence and intriguing genius, where has Ruskin been this past century - save in the names of south London streets, of a few down-at-heel working-men's clubs in an age when we're all supposed to be middle class, and of that outgrowth of prickly late-Victorian red-brick buildings forever boarded up and due to be replaced any moment by a drive-thru McDonald's or anonymous distribution depot? Ruskin's memory, however, has also lived on in the minds of those who have discovered this extraordinary man and original thinker for themselves. They include the likes of Hewison, Wildman and Warrell, and a core of dedicated Ruskinites harumphing around the globe. My own voyage around this uncategorisable Victorian began as a teenager when walking in the Lake District. I imagined myself following in the footsteps of Coleridge, Wordsworth and Southey, of Hazlitt and De Quincey, when I came across Brantwood, Ruskin's picturesque home on the banks of Coniston Water, without knowing who Ruskin was. Unlike Coleridge and Wordsworth, he wasn't taught at school, and figured neither in my local nor my school libraries. I took Brantwood, with its then overgrown gardens and general state of shabby yet pleasing decay, to be either an old person's home or the sort of windy, rattly house to which Catholic children are sent on retreats by well-meaning priests. Inside, a man in damp tweeds and a beard sold me a red clothbound copy of Unto This Last for 40p. I sat in the slanting, slate chair Ruskin had made for himself beside a stuttering waterfall among the ferns that brushed the forlorn gardens, and read that book from cover to cover. It had been a Johannine conversion on the road to Coniston. Unto This Last explained, in language far greater than that of Wordsworth or Southey, and the equal of Coleridge, how it was possible to reconcile a Christian upbringing with a belief in radical politics, equal opportunities for all and a love of art. Only connect . . . and did Ruskin make the connections. At university, I bought as many second-hand copies of Ruskin's works as my grant would allow, which was ultimately far more than a shelf-full. Wonderful tomes such as The Seven Lamps Of Architecture, The Stones Of Venice and Sesame And The Lilies went for 25, 30, and very occasionally 60 pence in a green George Allen hardback edition. In my third year, I was sold the handsome Cook &amp; Wedderburn library edition of Ruskin for approximately 38 1/2 pence a volume (there are 39 of them). The bookseller had just cleared a houseful of unwanted books. Here came that odd undergraduate looking for Ruskin again. Just take them . . . 15 quid the job lot. Just before Christmas last year, I visited Brantwood for the first time in a long while. Lottery grants have seen the house Ruskin bought in 1871 come to life under the care of its knowledgeable and likeable curator, Howard Hull, and the Ruskin Foundation. The gardens promise to blossom healthily this spring, to become again the botanical laboratory Ruskin wanted them to be: he was an early champion of ecology and conservation. Just inside the back door (main entrance for the public; 35,000 visitors a year, with a further 15,000 rambling up and through the steep-sided 250-acre Brantwood estate alone) is a healthily-stocked bookshop. Those green Ruskin editions are on sale today for up to \u00a335 each. A complete set of Cook &amp; Wedderburn goes, I learn, usually in auctions, for upwards of \u00a32,000. A pantheon of biographies has been published over the past decade, Tim Hilton's two-parter perhaps the best. Clearly there are people who value Ruskin - I met a couple of dozen at a Ruskin seminar held in the New Town-style architecture of Lancaster University last December - and each of them appears to have undergone much the same conversion on the road to Coniston as I did. At Brantwood, Ruskin's beginning and end meet. I lay on the bed in the small, fire-lit room in which he died. Beyond the window and across the darkness of the long lake loomed the snow-capped peak of the Old Man of Coniston. Holding his cousin Joan Severn's hand, this was the last sight Ruskin saw - this and floor-to-ceiling, wall-to-wall Turner watercolours (sadly, long since gone). The bedroom he retreated to in the decade of his largely silent madness connected the reality of the Lake peaks with the spirited drama of Turner's Alpine landscapes. It had been as an eloquent defender of Turner's reputation that the young Ruskin made his mark as author of the first volume of Modern Painters in 1843, and began his grand intellectual tour of art, architecture, politics, economics and social welfare. Ruskin was aged 24 then, and only recently down from Christ Church. He had taken more than a year out in the middle of his studies to travel across Europe, by carriage, with his devoted and evangelical parents, John James and Margaret. These two, married late, were first cousins. Scots, they met in Edinburgh. John James went on to make a fortune in the sherry trade as a partner of Ruskin, Telford &amp; Domecq. He bought books and paintings. John - born in Bloomsbury in 1819, and brought up in Herne Hill and Denmark Hill in what was once sylvan south London - was their only son. Margaret hoped he would enter the church and ultimately, so John said, become an archbishop. Always a great preacher - in later life, his lectures on art, life, the universe etc were highly animated and enthusiastically attended - he was to question the orthodoxies of the Christian religion in which he had been so assiduously brought up. His religious doubts were later to contribute to the loss of the love of his life, the young Anglo-Irish evangelical Rose La Touche (1848-1875), which loss led to madness. Ruskin's time off from Oxford was occasioned by the news that his first love, Ad\u00e8le Domecq, one of the three beautiful Parisian daughters of his father's Spanish business partner, had married a rich French count. Rejection hit Ruskin hard. He took love seriously and fell dangerously ill. Yet what was the gorgeous, cosmopolitan Catholic Ad\u00e8le to make of this thin, if handsome, and awkward Protestant intellectual? He must have been as remote to her as later he proved to be to his wife. His sanity and health were ultimately restored through a trip to the Alps - he was to become an eminent amateur geologist, and resorted to sorting rocks and stones whenever unreason or unwanted guests threatened - and then to his beloved Venice. By this time, he had met JMW Turner. The miserly and misanthropic Cockney artist accepted the adulation and generosity of the Oxford-educated dandy, and brought him, at first a little grudgingly, into the extraordinary worlds of his London house in Queen Anne Street - crowded with his \"children\", his own paintings - and of his imagination. Inspired by Turner's watercolours, the Ruskins would travel, as far as their old-fashioned carriage weighed down with improving books allowed, to each and every site, many around Chamonix, where Turner had established his easel. In 1841, John met the young Euphemia Gray, and wrote for her his popular and delightful fairytale, King Of The Golden River. His life was essentially happy at this point. He sat in his study at his parents' grand and well-staffed new house in its own grounds, with cats and dogs, at Denmark Hill and wrote the first volume of Modern Painters, a defence of Turner, comparing his hero to the masters of the Renaissance. The author was \"A Graduate of Oxford\", for Ruskin felt that his youth would prejudice critics. In fact, Modern Painters was well reviewed. The complete work, a magisterial and occasionally baffling incursion into many aspects of art and society, was to cover five volumes and not to be completed until 1860. By this time, Ruskin, always a prodigious and tireless author, had also written his hugely influential and best-selling The Seven Lamps Of Architecture (1849), The Stones Of Venice (first volume, 1851, the year of the Great Exhibition at the Crystal Palace), The Political Economy Of Art and the essays, published in Cornhill Magazine, that formed his greatest book, Unto This Last. In 1844, John James, proud of his son's new reputation as a top-drawer author, bought him Turner's turbulent oil painting Slavers, a 250-guinea New Year's present (this ended up in Princeton, New Jersey, and can be seen here for the first time in a very long while at Tate Britain this spring). The next year, he made his first trip abroad without his parents. He travelled with two varsity pals overland to Venice; characteristically, he was upset by the new railway bridge crossing the lagoon from Mestre to La Serenissima, complaining in a letter to his father that the Grand Canal below Rialto was \"adorned with gas lamps! in grand new iron posts of the last Birmingham fashion\". He was learning to thunder as well as to reason. And then came marriage to Effie Gray. Was it a mistake from the outset, the wealthy and successful young intellectual and author wedded in 1848 to a cute and ambitious Edinburgh society fledgling in need of a fortune? In hindsight, maybe. Ruskin's friend, the Pre-Raphaelite painter, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, described Effie as \"a young, lively party, rather shrewd and rather hard\", and \"snobbish\" to boot.

John was always wrapped up in his protean labours, which must have seemed more than strange to the party-loving Effie.

An unlikely revolutionary, his increasing fascination with the workings of society and the political economy, and what he did with that fascination, affects us to this day. Of the four essays that comprise Unto This Last, he wrote, justly, \"I believe them to be the best, that is to say, the truest, rightest-worded, and the most serviceable things I have ever written; and the last of them, having had especial pains spent on it, is probably the best I shall ever write.\" What was so special about Unto This Last?

      "body": "<p><strong> The World History Of Beekeeping and Honey Hunting</strong><br>Eva Crane <br>Duckworth, \u00a385, 720pp</p> <p>Reading this book with great pleasure and profit over the past month, I was reminded of Watson in Conan Doyle's His Last Bow. \"But you had retired, Holmes. We heard of you as living the life of a hermit among your bees and your books on a small farm.\" Sherlock replies: \"Exactly, Watson. Here is the fruit of my leisured ease, the magnum opus of my latter years, The Practical Handbook of Bee Culture.\" </p> <p>I have been a beekeeper in Hawaii, on the north shore of the island of Oahu, for six years, but I am still learning the trade. I started with four hives and now have close to 80, on different parts of the island. Farmers and fruit-growers welcome the siting of my hives on their land - for pollination, to increase their yield. </p> <p>My curiosity about beekeeping was aroused when I read that Sherlock Holmes story. So one could just retire to the country and keep bees, eh? After years of entertaining this fantasy I found myself in Hawaii and thought: surely this is the perfect place - 12 months of sunshine and plenty of flowers. I made enquiries and found that indeed there were many beekeepers in Hawaii, most of them elderly hobbyists, with some serious bee businesses on the Big Island of Hawaii, where there are lehua and kiawe blossoms which produce delicious honey. </p> <p>As Eva Crane indicates in her section on Australian beekeeping, the different varieties of eucalyptus produce many flowers, and bees flock to them, converting the nectar into a dark, pleasant honey. We have eucalyptus here, and when those flowers are over, there are lots of others. Bees range widely and can find blossoms that are hardly visible - and they keep to them until the flowers are exhausted, for \"flower fidelity\" is a bee characteristic. (I am speaking of Apis mellifera, the honeybee associated with the Mediterranean that has been introduced all over the world; my first-hand knowledge of other varieties is scanty.) </p> <p>The unfortunate fact is that beekeeping is heavy work (lots of fetching and carrying, arduous spinning of the honey-filled frames) and not very profitable. A pound of honey wholesales for about a quid, which is why I still need to supplement my income by doing a bit of writing now and then. </p> <p>Bees have a long history. Chimpanzees hunt honey in Africa in the same way that people do: following the honeyguide bird, the males going up the tree first - they even use tools. The Egyptians believed the first bee to have been created from a teardrop of Ra, the sun god. The Mayans worshipped a bee god named Ah Mucan Cab. The bee was regarded as sacred by the hairy forest dwellers of old Europe (7000-3500 BC), too. </p> <p>Bees and honey have had a profound influence upon Christianity - the beeswax candle was specified in Christian rituals. I recall these candles' peculiar stickiness and pungency from my days as an altar boy, especially on the Feast of St Blaise, when they were used to ward off neck ailments. The Paschal Candle comes straight from pagan bee-obsession, as (perhaps) does Candlemas. Many other religions involve bees. </p> <p>Honey itself is an ancient offering in the cultures of Persia, Egypt and Greece. David Livingstone noted that a honey tribute was demanded by the chiefs along the Zambezi. The Dead Sea Scrolls prohibit the eating of bee brood. Honey is a feature in the Hebrew promised land, the Norse Valhalla, the paradise of the Muslims and of the Celts in northern Europe; while \"in Southern Africa, San people believed that after death 'they will find great feasting on locusts and honey'.\" The hive has been regarded a model of Christianity and a model of civilisation. Greeks believed that bees were generated from the carcass of an ox. </p> <p>Honey lasts for thousands of years: it contains distinct anti-microbial systems. In the mating flight, the queen might be fertilised by six or eight drones before returning to earth with their torn-off genitals attached to her. Stingless bees occur all over southeast Asia. Bees communicate through sound (Apis mellifera has sound receptors); by dance (the round dance, the wagtail); by taste (sampling nectar from an incoming bee); but most of all by scent. </p> <p>Bees have a phenomenal ability to detect smells. The queen controls the hive with her pheromones, and the sting itself gives off a scent of aggression that attracts flights of warrior bees from the hive. </p> <p>And much, much more. Eva Crane's book is the classic that everyone interested in bees, beekeeping or honey in human history has been waiting for. There are many of us, and now we have our encyclopedic work. A whole library of slighter books exists on this and related subjects, but this is the masterwork - for its enormous scope and exhaustiveness, for being a treasure house of apiaristic facts as well as totally up-to-date. </p> <p>Some 37 books, articles, scholarly papers and pamphlets on bees, honey and history bear Eva Crane's name, from The Book of Honey to the essay \"Traditional management systems for Apis dorsata in the submerged forests of southern Vietnam and central Kalimantan\". But this book is Eva Crane's magnum opus (Sherlock Holmes would covet a copy).</p> <p>It is also clear - as the Apis dorsata article implies - that Crane is a traveller, for her book abounds with references to beekeeping in many countries. It is a characteristic of travelling beekeepers to notice the peregrinations of bees, in whatever country - what variety of bees, what sort of flowers, and how intrepid the honey hunters. On a trip to the Philippines, paddling off the island of Palawan last year, I did a bunk one day and went honey-hunting with some local people just for the fun of it. I now know that the bees I saw must have been Apis dorsata. </p> <p>In a warm climate, bees flourish to such an extent that hives proliferate in geometric progression. An instructive part of Eva Crane's book concerns the diseases which have eliminated wild bees in many parts of the mainland US and decimated the hives. Two thousand miles from the nearest land, Hawaii has remained free of these diseases, which is why my initial four hives were soon eight, and then 16. And my bees do not have to endure the winter that reduces the hive population in freezing places. Look into an English hive in February and you will see a ball of huddled bees trying to keep warm, living on their stored honey. As soon as the weather becomes clement, the hive's population increases and at its height can number as many as 40,000. </p> <p>That is why, if you make them cross, you might end up with enough stings to kill you. Africanised bees have become a problem as - since 1957, when just 26 colonies, brought from Africa, got loose - they have crept from Brazil to the southeastern US. The bees were programmed to be tough, hyper-alert and aggressive, since they lived in the open in Africa and so had many natural enemies. Until someone is able to convince them that they are now in a happier land, they will go on making a nuisance of themselves. </p> <p>Another excellent section of this book deals with stings. Bees have been a military weapon from the earliest times, and were effectively deployed by the Viet Cong against Americans in Vietnam. Bee stings have been known to alleviate the symptoms of arthritis; as for the benefits of royal jelly, seen as a life-lengthener and libido-enhancer, you need look no further than the life and career of Barbara Cartland. </p> <p>The absence of Ms Cartland's rhapsodies about royal jelly is not a serious omission in this book, however, and though there are some gaps, my mentioning them is just pedantry and niggling. I was not able to find any reference to Holmes. Nothing about Thomas Hardy - quite a few bees there. Lots of buzzing in the unnamed Tolstoy too, and I did not see anything about Napoleon's love of bees as his personal insignia (though Corsica gets an entry as a bee-friendly island). There is no mention of WH Hudson, who in The Crystal Age (1887) recommended the hive as a blueprint for a Utopia in which the sexual impulse would cease to exist; nothing of Yeats's bee-loud glade. </p> <p>When Flaubert went to Egypt, he rejoiced in finding the celebrated woman who, naked (the musicians were blindfolded), did the \"Dance of the Bee\". No allusion to this event here - and for anyone who thinks, \"Oh, the bee must be a reference to displaying her genitals\", the answer is: probably not. Egyptian slang for clitoris is \"hornet\" (zembur), not bee (nahlah). </p> <p>Arabic is rich in expressions based on honey (asal), using \"a month of honey\" to describe the post-nuptial weeks; an afternoon nap is ta'sila, which can roughly be translated as \"a taste of honey\". </p> <p>This is a greatly satisfying book in which one discovers the whole world and almost every culture to be linked by the great unifying bee, its imagery and industry, and the sweetness of honey.</p> <p>#149; Paul Theroux's new book, Fresh-Air Fiend, is published later this month (Hamish Hamilton, \u00a320).</p>",

Bee stings have been known to alleviate the symptoms of arthritis; as for the benefits of royal jelly, seen as a life-lengthener and libido-enhancer, you need look no further than the life and career of Barbara Cartland. The absence of Ms Cartland's rhapsodies about royal jelly is not a serious omission in this book, however, and though there are some gaps, my mentioning them is just pedantry and niggling. I was not able to find any reference to Holmes. Nothing about Thomas Hardy - quite a few bees there. Lots of buzzing in the unnamed Tolstoy too, and I did not see anything about Napoleon's love of bees as his personal insignia (though Corsica gets an entry as a bee-friendly island). There is no mention of WH Hudson, who in The Crystal Age (1887) recommended the hive as a blueprint for a Utopia in which the sexual impulse would cease to exist; nothing of Yeats's bee-loud glade. When Flaubert went to Egypt, he rejoiced in finding the celebrated woman who, naked (the musicians were blindfolded), did the \"Dance of the Bee\". No allusion to this event here - and for anyone who thinks, \"Oh, the bee must be a reference to displaying her genitals\", the answer is: probably not. Egyptian slang for clitoris is \"hornet\" (zembur), not bee (nahlah). Arabic is rich in expressions based on honey (asal), using \"a month of honey\" to describe the post-nuptial weeks; an afternoon nap is ta'sila, which can roughly be translated as \"a taste of honey\". This is a greatly satisfying book in which one discovers the whole world and almost every culture to be linked by the great unifying bee, its imagery and industry, and the sweetness of honey. #149; Paul Theroux's new book, Fresh-Air Fiend, is published later this month (Hamish Hamilton, \u00a320).",

In Dixon's song, the reference was to America's slave heritage - a legacy that has now slipped, musically, from blues to reggae. It is a beat heavy with myth, heavy with history, binding Rastafarianism's confused roots in the Ethiopian church with the legend of Prester John - the medieval warrior king who would come out of the East in God's defence - and the country's fabled possession of the Ark of the Covenant. </p> <p>As he traces Bruce's travels through Abyssinia (as Ethiopia was then known), it is Miles Bredin's contention that as well as searching for the source of the Nile, he was looking for the lost Ark. There is circumstantial evidence for this: Bruce was a Mason, a member of the Canongate Kilwining Lodge No 2. The most powerful lodge in Britain, its members in Bruce's time included Johnson's biographer Boswell and many other important figures. \"The Craft\", as Masonry styled itself, had its roots in the medieval Templars. They had their own links with Abyssinia, and the Ark and the lost biblical Book of Enoch - which Bruce would bring back with him - were important to both organisations. </p> <p>Bredin admits he can't really prove his thesis, but the mystic lure of the Ark certainly adds to the excitement of what is essentially a quest narrative. The real object, however, was a spring. Although no mystery to those who lived around it, the riddle of the source of the Nile had perplexed scholars and explorers from Ptolemy to Prince Henry the Navigator. It was this \"opprobrium of geographers\" which led Bruce to set off to Abyssinia in 1762, via a consulship in Algiers and an exploration of the Red Sea, in search of it. </p> <p>It took him seven years to get there, and he cut quite a figure along the way - a man, in the words of the historian Nimmo, \"of Herculean physique and more than ordinary strength of mind\". But Bruce was not just a giant physically (six foot four, with dark red hair, he stood seven feet tall in the armour he later wore as an Abyssinian captain of horse); he was a giant of the Enlightenment, too. His exploits marked him out, along with Hume, Watt and Boswell, as \"one of the first of an extraordinary concentration of Scots who would transform the country and, with the outward looking attitude of which Bruce was pioneer, the world\". </p> <p>Predominantly self-taught (by the time he eventually reached his destination, he was master of some 14 languages, including Geez, the - even then - fast-disappearing liturgical language of Ethiopia), he was an expert shot and horseman. He became knowledgeable in tropical medicine. He was a proficient painter. His funds for the journey had something of the Enlightenment about them, too: they came from a rich seam of coal on his estate that was used to smelt iron in a new scientific process. </p> <p>The equipment Bruce took with him was a fantastic mixture of ancient and modern: measuring rods, three telescopes, quadrants, charts of the stars, three ship's blunderbusses, several pistols, a variety of swords - and, to ease the pain of travel, medicine, tobacco and wine. He was, indeed, \"as well-prepared as Evelyn Waugh's William Boot in Scoop in all but one respect: he had no cleft sticks, for it was Bruce who discovered that they are used in the Ethiopian highlands by message bearers\". </p> <p>The blunderbusses included one with a joint in the stock (Bredin later sees it in the home of Bruce's descendant Lord Elgin), which could be clicked into place and produced, Clint Eastwood-like, from under a cloak. Bruce's life, ever under threat from attacks by bandits and local chieftains, would be saved by exactly such a strategy. </p> <p>Abyssinia was ruled by a treacherous, shifting series of alliances.

The most important of these was with the beautiful Ozoro Esther, Michael's wife. Abyssinian sexual mores appear to have been very liberated: far from being angry, the Ras seemed to encourage the liaison. This bedroom diplomacy nearly always seemed to improve the big Scot's standing. </p> <p>In late 1770, with Bruce's arrival at the source of the river - a swamp with two fountains in it, it is now a lump of concrete with a metal pump emerging from it - came another sexual conquest.

It's a measure of Igor Stravinsky's domination for almost half the 20th century that since his death in 1971 his significance has never been doubted. </p> <p>Yet for all that has been written about Stravinsky and his music, both during his long lifetime and afterwards, his character continues to be an enigma. Geographically and musically we know where he came from - Russia - and where he took himself and his work, in a chameleon-like creative development that spanned more than 60 years, but that is about all. </p> <p>For the rest we've had to fall back on flimsily supported anecdote or the composer's own embroidered versions of his life story, beginning with the autobiography in French in the 30s and developing in the series of conversations (in English) with his assistant and subsequent chronicler Robert Craft, which began to appear in 1959. In those books Stravinsky reinvented himself and his history as resourcefully as he reoriented his musical language throughout his career. </p> <p>That carefully constructed mythology has blurred the image of one of the supreme artists of our time, and Stephen Walsh's meticulously researched and scrupulously detailed biography sets out to bring it all into focus. This hefty first volume takes Stravinsky from birth in St Petersburg in 1882 to celebrity in Paris, via the grounding he received in the Russian tradition embodied in his teacher Rimsky-Korsakov, and the dazzling success of the early ballets composed for Diaghilev's Ballets Russes: The Firebird, Petrushka and The Rite of Spring, which spectacularly kick-started his international reputation and defined his position in the vanguard of modernism. </p> <p>It moves on to the peripatetic life in western Europe forced upon him by the first world war, and finally to the years in which he settled more or less in France. Here he combined composition with the role of an itinerant musician, conducting and playing his own works with leading orchestras in Europe and the US, while his private life - wife and children in the south of France, mistress in Paris - became increasingly complicated. </p> <p>Walsh has done a wonderful job documenting those physical transformations, and in an entirely non-analytical but remarkably perceptive way he has also drawn out the significance of the musical development. His detailing of Stravinsky's upbringing, much of it taken from letters which have never appeared in English before, is the most compelling part of his book: it provides a corrective to Stravinsky's own revisionism, which was at its most ruthless when it came to his parents' role in his musical training. It is as if the composer wanted to project the image of his genius as materialising from nowhere, succeeding in spite of, rather than because of, his parents. </p> <p>But, as Walsh shows, Stravinsky's parents encouraged his musicality to the extent of organising piano lessons, even if his authoritarian father Fyodor, a singer at the Maryinsky Theatre in St Petersburg and the leading Russian bass of his time, insisted his son study law at university rather than composition. But Igor's genius had a slow-burning fuse anyway: there were no teenage masterpieces, indeed no work of real substance until he was in his early 20s. From that point, though, he developed frighteningly fast: just 10 years separate the conservative Piano Sonata from the cataclysm of The Rite of Spring. </p> <p>Walsh's declared unwillingness to speculate, or to write anything that might be construed as psychobiography, means that he does not attempt to explain that very rapid evolution in extra-musical terms. But the decaying imperial world of St Petersburg is brought vividly to life, and the broader context in which Stravinsky matured is carefully detailed. </p> <p>When the story reaches Paris, and everything opens up for the composer in a spectacularly chic way, this tight focus becomes more frustrating. The world in which Stravinsky moved was as culturally rich as at any time in the 20th century, and largely thanks to Diaghilev he became part of it, meeting Picasso and Braque, Gide, Proust and the young Cocteau, as well as Ravel and Debussy.</p> <p>It is not just idle curiosity that makes one long to know more about Stravinsky's relationship with some of those figures, but their involvement is confined to walk-on parts; even the legendary occasion on which Debussy and Stravinsky played through The Rite of Spring on two pianos before its premiere is mentioned only in passing. Most curious of all, the description of the genesis of the Symphonies of Wind Instruments, one of Stravinsky's most original works, makes no mention of Debussy, although a chorale written in his memory was the starting point for the score. </p> <p>It would have good, too, to have been given a bit more about Nadia Boulanger, who seems just to materialise in Stravinsky's circle around 1930. You would hardly guess from this book how influential Boulanger's role in spreading the gospel of Stravinskian neo-classicism was on both sides of the Atlantic, any more than you would realise that Vera Sudeykina would become the second Mrs Stravinsky in the 1940s, in what will be the second volume of Walsh's book. </p> <p>The facts presented here are copious, but instead of minute details of Stravinsky's endless wrangling over fees and royalties, and the programmes of every conducting engagement, a broader impression of the man himself and the impression he made on those around him would have been welcome. Stravinsky's admiration for Mussolini in the early 30s, and his apparently unthinking anti-semitism, are reported with relatively little fuss. Reading between the lines (though Walsh is occasionally censorious), Stravinsky was probably a pretty dislikeable man, but we're never given enough evidence to make up our own minds.</p>",

When you're doing lengths, you end up \"swimming back through your own wake\", sometimes experiencing the \"realm of pure spirit\". </p> <p>When our precocious swimmer retires, the story relinquishes its urgency.

      "body": "<p>Isabel Allende divides her life starkly into two: before and after the 1973 coup in Chile that brought General Augusto Pinochet to power and precipitated an exile from which she has never fully returned. \"I never imagined such a thing was possible in Chile, which had such a solid, 160-year-old democracy - it was called the 'England' of Latin America,\" she says. \"It was a revelation that there were concentration camps and torture centres all over the country. It had been there in the shadows, the brutality and violence, but for me, it was like waking into a nightmare.\" </p> <p>The military coup toppled her \"uncle\" - strictly, her second cousin - and godfather Salvador Allende, the world's first freely elected Marxist president, who committed suicide - or was murdered - in the burning presidential palace in Santiago. (That his daughter, now a Socialist politician, is also called Isabel still results in juxtaposed portraits in the British press, a confusion that the author, who sometimes fancies she was switched with another infant at birth, might relish.) </p> <p>Yet while her family, like a million other Chilean exiles, was scattered by the coup, she is convinced that had she not fled across the mountains, eventually making her way to Venezuela, where she stayed until 1987, she would not have become a writer. That vocation not only helped her break the junta's \"chain of hatred\" in her own soul, but later eased her recovery from the death, seven years ago, of her 28-year-old daughter Paula, who had lain comatose for 12 months with the rare genetic disorder, porphyria. For Allende, writing has in part been a tenacious reflex to loss, whether of exile or bereavement. </p> <p>Now 57, she wrote her first novel when she was almost 40, in Venezuela. The House Of The Spirits (1982), tracing four generations of Chilean women up to the aftermath of the coup, became an international bestseller. With its English translation in 1985, she became the first of many women writing in Latin America to join the fraternity enjoying worldwide acclaim since the so-called Latin literary boom of the 1960s and 70s - most notably the 1982 Nobel laureate Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, Carlos Fuentes and Mario Vargas Llosa. </p> <p>Her books - five novels, a collection of stories and two non-fiction works - have sold millions in 27 languages across the world. They have inspired plays and films, including, in 1993, Bille August's The House Of The Spirits, starring Jeremy Irons and Meryl Streep, and in 1994 Betty Kaplan's Of Love And Shadows, starring Antonio Banderas. There was even a musical in Iceland based on The House Of The Spirits. </p> <p>Her appeal to her compatriots lies partly in the Allende name and her vocal opposition to the junta. But the allure of her writing is far wider. Ilan Stavans, professor of Spanish at Amherst College in Massachusetts, says: \"She came late to the banquet but achieved an international reputation that exceeded many men. She brings feelings to the fore in a way male writers don't, with a panoramic view of politics and history that illuminates the connection with individual lives.\" </p> <p>Yet her critical reception has been mixed. While Fay Weldon called The House Of The Spirits the \"perfect novel - now that's written the rest of us can all go home\", others lament that the early \"spell\" has been broken, complaining of shallow romance and potboilers, of sentiment that tips into sentimentality. Some bemoan a north American influence on her fiction since she moved to the United States in 1987. </p> <p>\"There's an ambivalence towards her even among Latin American critics,\" Prof Stavans says. \"She revived a tradition of melodrama and the light women's novel - la novela rosa , as serialised in newspapers across the Spanish-speaking world - and turned it around in a more sophisticated way to bring to mind 'magical realism'. She's called derivative by those who saw The House Of The Spirits as a revamp of [M\u00e1rquez's] One Hundred Years Of Solitude from the point of view of women. But what infuriates them is the bridge she forms between popular culture and the highbrow, and that she's so successful.\" </p> <p>Alberto Manguel, who edited Other Fires, an anthology of work by Latin American women writers less fortunate in attracting English translators (for which Allende wrote a warm preface), says: \"She is fascinated by melodrama, the romanticised, the sentimental. But she's much more interesting stylistically, and is able to tell these stories without forgetting political angles. She asserts the right of her women characters to live their own lives and speak in their own language - which can verge on purple prose, though there's no such thing in Spanish.\" Of her popularity in the English-speaking world, he adds: \"Her fiction does correspond to the stereotypical vision of what Latin America might be: the passionate, dark-eyed heroine; the cool, male, governor - you are in the world of El Zorro. But that overlap is not a fault in the writing.\" </p> <p>Poised and very funny, though more serious in private, Allende appears to mirror her books' vivacious if volatile mix of hard realism and playfully-edged romanticism. She was shortlisted for the Literary Review's Bad Sex Award for Daughter Of Fortune, her first novel in eight years, and read out the \"offending\" passages at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London during her recent visit - she hadn't been to Britain for a decade - with amusement and aplomb, her tone underlining their deflating irony. </p> <p>A California bookseller and friend, Elaine Petrocelli, calls her \"very forthright and transparent. There aren't two Isabels; there's only one.\" But while Allende declares dramatically that all the women in her family run headlong after men - as she did in emigrating from Venezuela to California (\"The second move was by choice; I fell in lust with a guy\") - she has been adamant about earning her own living since she was 17. </p> <p>Daughter Of Fortune began, she says, as a book about passion and ended up being about freedom. Set amid the Californian goldrush of the mid 19th century, its main characters are Chileans and Chinese who followed the trail for reasons of their own. Yet the lover whom the heroine Eliza follows from Chile fades from the plot, leaving only traces of a mythic Latino bandit. Eliza, disguised as a boy, grows too fond of her new-found liberty to relinquish it even for the most seductive man. </p> <p>\"When Eliza is sleeping outdoors, surrounded by snakes, bears, Indians, bandits, for the first time in her life she's not afraid, not restrained in a corset,\" says Allende. \"It's an epiphany I had: the self-sufficiency she has now she can't give up. I belonged to the first generation of organised feminists in Chile, though by no means the first - my grandmother struggled for the vote. Going out into a man's world, like Eliza, to do things their mothers would never have dreamt of doing, to conquer that space, is what my generation of women did.\" </p> <p>Isabel Allende was born during the second world war in Lima, Peru. Her father Tom\u00e1s Allende (Salvador's cousin) was a Chilean diplomat who absconded in an \"unsolved mystery\" from both his job and his family when Isabel was three. She now thinks he may have been bisexual and embroiled in a scandal. She never saw him again (her mother cut his face out of all family photographs) until called upon to identify his body after he suffered a heart attack in the street. She was unable to recall what he had looked like. Allende sees herself as marked by his disappearance. </p> <p>\"Until very recently, I didn't trust men,\" she says. \"I thought they weren't reliable; if you wanted something done, you had to do it yourself - including raising the kids. I never allowed anyone else to pay the bills because I understood that economic independence created the rest; I started working early and I've worked all my life. I never surrendered to a relationship with a man the way I did to my children and my mother.\" </p> <p>She returned to Chile with her mother to live with her maternal grandparents and two uncles in Santiago. While the grandly conservative Catholic household left the poor-relation Isabel prone to rebellion and mixing with the Amerindian servants, its anglophilia later found ironic expression in the English expatriates of Daughter Of Fortune. \"My grandfather was Basque and my grandmother Castilian, but everything from England was good - including the soap. I was born in the middle of the second world war, and practically everyone in the country had pro-German sympathies; the Chilean armed forces were trained by the Prussians. But my grandparents were knitting socks for the British troops.\" </p> <p>After she was 10, and her mother remarried another diplomat, Allende lived in Bolivia and Lebanon, attending a Beirut school run by British Quakers, before being sent home at 15 (her grandfather enrolled her in an English finishing school), and starting work two years later. She had a spell translating Barbara Cartland into Spanish (\"I couldn't resist making improvements\"), then became a successful journalist, working for a magazine, Paula, that campaigned for divorce and abortion in the staunchly Catholic country, and penning \"humorous\" feminist columns, including one called \"Civilise Your Caveman\". In the 1960s - sporting long, dyed-blonde hair and driving a car painted with giant flowers - she had her own TV chat show. </p> <p>\"I was a lousy journalist,\" she insists. \"I had no problem exaggerating or making up quotes. My colleagues thought they were being objective, but I never thought they were and I didn't even pretend.\" Flattered by a lunch invitation from Chile's Nobel poet laureate Pablo Neruda, she supposed she had been summoned to interview him. \"He laughed and said he would never allow himself to be interviewed by me; that I was the worst journalist and I only ever wrote about myself. But he was amused by my columns.\" </p> <p>At 19, Allende married an Anglo-Chilean engineering student with whom she lived for 25 years and had two children. She says she served him \"like a geisha\". \"It was the way a Latin American woman served a man, but I exaggerated, because all my life is about exaggeration. I had three jobs. We had a car; he'd take it, and I'd go on the bus with the grocery, then come running home to serve him a drink. I thought I was a feminist, but I was raising the children alone; my husband never changed a diaper. I never applied the theory to my practical life.\" </p> <p> Though not \"political\" like her Allende cousins, she chaffed against not only male prerogatives (\"I'd wanted to be a man since I was five\") but an impervious hierarchy that was partly racial: the more Indian the blood, the lower the class. \"I'm fascinated with how you can break a system, defy and challenge it. As a woman, that's determined my life,\" she says. \"I was brought up seeing the injustice of a class system; the poor didn't have a chance. The people who had control for generations had impunity. It was very hard to change society when I was growing up, though it happened with Salvador Allende.\" </p> <p>While she regrets not having done more for her uncle's short-lived regime, the military coup when she was 31 awoke her to \"the amount of evil that was possible\". \"I was a very frivolous person; involved in women's issues and feminism but not politics. In my humorous columns or TV programme I was always looking for the ironic and funny; I failed to see the tragedy brewing in my country.\" But in the first 48 hours after the coup, her \"perpetual innocence, extended adolescence\" were shattered. \"My husband, who was in the construction business, had to take food to workers stranded by the curfew. We went out slowly in the car, with a white flag, and were stopped 10 or 20 times. Driving through the streets, I could see corpses, and books being burned, and people dragged into trucks, running with blood.\" </p> <p>Partly because she was an Allende and a familiar face on television, she found herself called on to help the resistance. \"Through friends in the church, I smuggled information and hid people in my house before they could be taken to the border or, when that became unsafe, to asylum in embassies.\" The experience is most closely reflected in her second novel, Of Love And Shadows, in which a fashion journalist is drawn into the resistance after falling for a photographer. Though Allende had initially refused safe passage offered by the Mexican embassy, after 14 months of the terror she fled. \"By then I'd been fired from my job, and I was on a list. I couldn't take the fear for my family any more.\" Her husband joined her in Caracas when it became clear she could not return. </p> <p>Despite hardship, Venezuela was liberating. \"I'd come from a country where we dress in grey and pretend we're British, to a place enjoying the oil boom, where there was an erotic charge in the streets.\" The House Of The Spirits was begun on January 8 (Allende has since started all her books on the same date) as a letter to her dying grandfather, the model for its landowner and conservative senator Esteban Trueba, who backs the coup but becomes sickened by its brutality. His wife Clara was modelled on Allende's grandmother, a disciple of Madame Blavatsky who experimented with telepathy (\"she didn't trust the mail\"). While her daughter Blanca has a taboo romance with a young worker on El Patr\u00f3n's estate, her granddaughter Alba smuggles dissidents to sanctuary. </p> <p>\"I've worked with and for woman all my life and have known very few weak women,\" says Allende. \"In Latin American literature of the 60s and 70s boom, female protagonists were stereotypes, cliches - the prostitute, bride, mother - because that generation of men were brought up segregated from women.\" </p> <p>First published in Spain, the novel has elements of a style more associated with the Caribbean tropics - Alejo Carpentier's Cuba or Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's Colombian coast - than the Andes. Yet Allende has long ceased to be flattered by comparisons with the Nobel laureate - made, she says, only by anglophone critics. \"This always happens to women when they do anything creative; they need a male model to validate them. If I were a man, no one would be comparing me to anybody.\" </p> <p>For her, magical realism has been present across the world, from African and Arab tales, to Scandinavian sagas and Gothic novels. \"In the literary world of white males, the restrictive, rational literature written lately in industrialised nations, reality needs to be explained, controlled. With women of the same period there's a sense of magic, because we can't control things. As a writer I accept everything is possible; layers of truth and belief and the subjective - dreams, coincidences, fears, obsessions. All that gives texture to writing.\" </p> <p>Manguel, who dismisses the notion of a Latin American boom as \"an illiterate critical movement in the Anglo-Saxon world when everyone was read through the filter of Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\", rejects the view of Allende as derivative. \"The whole of literature written in Spanish either has an element of fantasy or is documentary, and these borders were crossed. Allende reflects the reality she knows, with an element that is not logical or rational, in a playful way.\" </p> <p>In The House Of The Spirits, myth and fact are fused (Salvador Allende appears as The Candidate and Pablo Neruda as The Poet), Allende blurring memory and imagination to overcome homesickness. \"I do invent memories. My grandmother died when I was so young, but people have told me I had a need to have a grandmother, so I used imagination and wishful thinking.\" The fantasy is seldom literal. (Of the film, shot in Denmark, Allende says: \"I missed the book's sense of humour, the irony - the movie had a Scandinavian gloom.\") </p> <p>She abandoned fantasy in Of Love And Shadows, which chronicled the real discovery of bodies of some of the \"disappeared\" in a disused mineshaft in 1978, and was written \"out of anger\". Yet in Eva Luna, about an Amerindian Sheherazade turned scriptwriter, and \"a celebration of being a woman and a storyteller\", she restored it with elements of kitsch borrowed from Latin soap opera, the telenovela . </p> <p>Antonio Sk\u00e1rmeta, the Chilean author on whose novel the film Il Postino was based, is writing a screenplay of Eva Luna for the same director, Michael Radford. \"Isabel makes fun of the telenovela, like all intellectuals do,\" Sk\u00e1rmeta says. \"But she has a tenderness towards the genre because people love and follow it.\" </p> <p>Allende's marriage faltered as she was succeeding as a writer. She went off on an affair with a musician in Madrid, but after three months she returned to Caracas. She divorced in 1987. \"Maybe I grew in a different direction. I wanted passion in my life. It wasn't infidelity or fights. We never slammed a door.\" Within months, she had met her second husband while on a book tour in California. William Gordon, an Irish-American lawyer contesting insurance companies for the \"small man\", grew up in the Los Angeles barrio (\"He thinks he speaks Spanish,\" Allende sniffs). He became the model for Gregory Reeves in her California-set novel The Infinite Plan, about a post-Vietnam generation \"defeated by the American dream\". </p> <p>While Allende was promoting the book in Spain her daughter Paula fell ill with porphyria, a hormonal disorder that is rarely fatal, but which left her in a coma. After six months in intensive care, she seemed strong enough to breathe without life support. \"She started breathing on her own, so we took her home to California and then western medicine gave up on her. For the six months till she died we tried everything: acupuncture, herbs, psychics, magnets, Shamanism, anything that might make her comfortable and that was not invasive. She'd already had enough pain.\" </p> <p>Alternative medicine is explored in Daughter Of Fortune, through the character of the Chinese physician Tao Chi'en, with whom Eliza slowly falls in love. But the book was halted by Paula's illness and death in December 1992. \"I thought I was never going to write again,\" Allende says. \"I had to pull myself out of a writer's block and very dark depression. I just went to hell; it's a moment of grief you can't avoid and can't make better. I tried Prozac; it didn't work - I'd rather be in pain. Nothing helps except time, but you start drawing from an inside strength, a resilience you didn't know you had.\" </p> <p>While her daughter was ill, Allende wrote an extended letter to her, in the diminishing hope that she would one day read it. The letter grew into her memoir Paula, which she calls \"the most important book I will ever write, which has the greatest truth. Writing is exorcism. It deals with the demons of the past, sorts out the confusion. Life happens so fast there's no time to see the connections or consequences; there's too much noise everywhere. But in my work, there is no noise. Everything has a ripple effect in a book; in the years of introspection, I grow. For me, it's like meditation or prayer.\" </p> <p>While her mother was aghast at the disclosure of \"family secrets\", Allende even added snatches of love letters between Paula and her husband of only a year, Ernesto. He consented to Isabel's taking Paula home to California because she was better able to care for her, with nurses. \"Ernesto called me on the phone, crying, saying 'Paula was different, you only knew her as a mother'. He sent me love letters they'd exchanged, revealing aspects of my daughter I didn't suspect. To me she was mainly intellectual, a brain. But she was emotionally immature, very dependent and - I was embarrassed - very passionate sexually.\" </p> <p>Austere yet full of lyrical flights of memory, interspersed with bulletins from her daughter's bedside, Paula has been seen as Allende's masterpiece and brought her a new readership. For her, \"it saved my life\". Yet she was unable to return to fiction, convinced \"that the world had lost its colour and that a universal greyness had spread inexorably over every surface\". </p> <p>She also had an experience mirrored in Eliza's asexual disguise. \"I turned 50 when Paula fell sick. Grief and menopause shut me down sexually and emotionally. I look at pictures and see I aged 10 years. I couldn't laugh. To me, sensuality is related to humour, and if I can't laugh, I can't make love. Maybe I felt that my daughter had all the right to be healthy and have sex. It was so hard to think of myself making love when she couldn't.\" </p> <p>It took three years for her to emerge from a tunnel of mourning. Aphrodite: A Memoir Of The Senses signalled a reviving interest in the sensual (she had erotic dreams about a \"salsa-smeared Antonio Banderas rolling naked on a tortilla\"). A playful meditation on aphrodisiacs - the \"bridge between gluttony and lust, interspersed with recipes\" - it helped her return to life and to fiction, though she reflects: \"I've changed because I have a sort of detachment now; I know how little I can control in my life or of others' safety and happiness, though to learn to love without trying to control the environment is hard.\" </p> <p>Her husband's daughter from a previous marriage - she had been a drug addict - also died around the time of Paula's death, a double blow that threatened to push them apart. \"We were so wounded we both retreated because we were vulnerable.\" Therapy helped. She says: \"Till recently a husband to me was an addendum who didn't share anything important - my work, insecurities, grief. With my second husband I've learned what love in a partnership is; to surrender, rely on and receive from another person - though I'm not dumping myself in anyone's lap.\" </p> <p>Settled in San Rafael, in northern California's affluent Marin county (she works in an office in a tower at her husband's law firm), Allende has attacked an \"apartheid\" where Latinos exist \"to care for children and wash cars, but people want them to disappear like ghosts at night\". In Daughter Of Fortune she explores people's impulse to reinvent themselves in a new land while tracing incipient hostilities between Yanquis and Latinos after the war in 1846-8 that forced Mexico to cede to the US territory where gold had been found only days before. \"I'm an immigrant myself. I live in an area with a large immigrant population - though I'm privileged: I'm legal and speak some English; I'm married to an American and can support myself.\" </p> <p>While some see her as having opened doors in the US for other Latina writers - Laura Esquival, Cristina Garc\u00eda, Sandra Cisneros - Allende senses changes in her own fiction. \"I speak less Spanish and my writing is becoming less baroque; I use fewer adjectives.\" Her mother, now 79, remains her editor, referring to her daughter's works as \"ours\", and rooting out the Spanglish words creeping into her prose (\"Her first comments are horrible, very negative\"). She lives in Chile where Allende often visits her. They have kept up an almost daily correspondence for 35 years. \"She's becoming smarter with age. I can't imagine what it will be like without her.\" </p> <p>Allende has now found a \"sisterhood\" in other US writers, such as Amy Tan, Barbara Kingsolver, Alice Walker and Louise Erdrich. At last, she says she feels settled. \"It was hard the first time [in Venezuela] because we didn't have the right state of mind. We were always looking south and never quite unpacked; I never expected the dictatorship to last 17 years.\" </p> <p>Since the amnesty of 1988, Allende has visited Chile often, where she is top of the bestseller lists, and says that even if Pinochet is freed by Britain after 15 months house arrest, and never faces trial, \"justice has been done; he's a pariah and an embarrassment, even to the right\" - though she adds with a shrewd stab of irony: \"I only hope he doesn't make a miraculous recovery and go back to sitting in the senate.\" </p> <p>She asks emotionally why his medical record should be kept secret when women raped under his regime were stripped of this privacy. Yet she also insists she no longer hates Pinochet. \"I realised 20 years ago that hatred is a very heavy burden. I'd still fight for what's truthful, but this is not about him but about grief that needs to be acknowledged for true reconciliation to take place.\" </p> <p>Her writing has sought to recover a place lost not only through exile but through childhood separation from Chile as a diplomat's daughter. \"In Chile I realise I'm a foreigner, even though I understand the codes and can speak with my own accent, and it's very sad for me to confront that,\" Allende says. \"I'm a foreigner in the US, too, and always will be. But my roots are more in my books now than in a place; my home will be in my writing.\" </p> <p><strong> Life at a glance: Isabel Allende </strong></p> <p><strong>Born: </strong> August 8 1942, Lima, Peru. </p> <p><strong> Education: </strong> Schools in Chile; Bolivia and Lebanon. </p> <p><strong> Married: </strong> 1962-87 Miguel Frias (one son, one daughter); 1988 William Gordon. </p> <p><strong> Domicile: </strong> Went into exile in Caracas, Venezuela, after 1973 Chilean coup.

      "bodyText": "Isabel Allende divides her life starkly into two: before and after the 1973 coup in Chile that brought General Augusto Pinochet to power and precipitated an exile from which she has never fully returned. \"I never imagined such a thing was possible in Chile, which had such a solid, 160-year-old democracy - it was called the 'England' of Latin America,\" she says. \"It was a revelation that there were concentration camps and torture centres all over the country. It had been there in the shadows, the brutality and violence, but for me, it was like waking into a nightmare.\" The military coup toppled her \"uncle\" - strictly, her second cousin - and godfather Salvador Allende, the world's first freely elected Marxist president, who committed suicide - or was murdered - in the burning presidential palace in Santiago. (That his daughter, now a Socialist politician, is also called Isabel still results in juxtaposed portraits in the British press, a confusion that the author, who sometimes fancies she was switched with another infant at birth, might relish.) Yet while her family, like a million other Chilean exiles, was scattered by the coup, she is convinced that had she not fled across the mountains, eventually making her way to Venezuela, where she stayed until 1987, she would not have become a writer. That vocation not only helped her break the junta's \"chain of hatred\" in her own soul, but later eased her recovery from the death, seven years ago, of her 28-year-old daughter Paula, who had lain comatose for 12 months with the rare genetic disorder, porphyria. For Allende, writing has in part been a tenacious reflex to loss, whether of exile or bereavement. Now 57, she wrote her first novel when she was almost 40, in Venezuela. The House Of The Spirits (1982), tracing four generations of Chilean women up to the aftermath of the coup, became an international bestseller. With its English translation in 1985, she became the first of many women writing in Latin America to join the fraternity enjoying worldwide acclaim since the so-called Latin literary boom of the 1960s and 70s - most notably the 1982 Nobel laureate Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, Carlos Fuentes and Mario Vargas Llosa. Her books - five novels, a collection of stories and two non-fiction works - have sold millions in 27 languages across the world. They have inspired plays and films, including, in 1993, Bille August's The House Of The Spirits, starring Jeremy Irons and Meryl Streep, and in 1994 Betty Kaplan's Of Love And Shadows, starring Antonio Banderas. There was even a musical in Iceland based on The House Of The Spirits. Her appeal to her compatriots lies partly in the Allende name and her vocal opposition to the junta. But the allure of her writing is far wider. Ilan Stavans, professor of Spanish at Amherst College in Massachusetts, says: \"She came late to the banquet but achieved an international reputation that exceeded many men. She brings feelings to the fore in a way male writers don't, with a panoramic view of politics and history that illuminates the connection with individual lives.\" Yet her critical reception has been mixed. While Fay Weldon called The House Of The Spirits the \"perfect novel - now that's written the rest of us can all go home\", others lament that the early \"spell\" has been broken, complaining of shallow romance and potboilers, of sentiment that tips into sentimentality. Some bemoan a north American influence on her fiction since she moved to the United States in 1987. \"There's an ambivalence towards her even among Latin American critics,\" Prof Stavans says. \"She revived a tradition of melodrama and the light women's novel - la novela rosa , as serialised in newspapers across the Spanish-speaking world - and turned it around in a more sophisticated way to bring to mind 'magical realism'.

She was shortlisted for the Literary Review's Bad Sex Award for Daughter Of Fortune, her first novel in eight years, and read out the \"offending\" passages at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London during her recent visit - she hadn't been to Britain for a decade - with amusement and aplomb, her tone underlining their deflating irony. A California bookseller and friend, Elaine Petrocelli, calls her \"very forthright and transparent. There aren't two Isabels; there's only one.\" But while Allende declares dramatically that all the women in her family run headlong after men - as she did in emigrating from Venezuela to California (\"The second move was by choice; I fell in lust with a guy\") - she has been adamant about earning her own living since she was 17. Daughter Of Fortune began, she says, as a book about passion and ended up being about freedom. Set amid the Californian goldrush of the mid 19th century, its main characters are Chileans and Chinese who followed the trail for reasons of their own. Yet the lover whom the heroine Eliza follows from Chile fades from the plot, leaving only traces of a mythic Latino bandit. Eliza, disguised as a boy, grows too fond of her new-found liberty to relinquish it even for the most seductive man. \"When Eliza is sleeping outdoors, surrounded by snakes, bears, Indians, bandits, for the first time in her life she's not afraid, not restrained in a corset,\" says Allende. \"It's an epiphany I had: the self-sufficiency she has now she can't give up.

While the grandly conservative Catholic household left the poor-relation Isabel prone to rebellion and mixing with the Amerindian servants, its anglophilia later found ironic expression in the English expatriates of Daughter Of Fortune. \"My grandfather was Basque and my grandmother Castilian, but everything from England was good - including the soap. I was born in the middle of the second world war, and practically everyone in the country had pro-German sympathies; the Chilean armed forces were trained by the Prussians. But my grandparents were knitting socks for the British troops.\" After she was 10, and her mother remarried another diplomat, Allende lived in Bolivia and Lebanon, attending a Beirut school run by British Quakers, before being sent home at 15 (her grandfather enrolled her in an English finishing school), and starting work two years later. She had a spell translating Barbara Cartland into Spanish (\"I couldn't resist making improvements\"), then became a successful journalist, working for a magazine, Paula, that campaigned for divorce and abortion in the staunchly Catholic country, and penning \"humorous\" feminist columns, including one called \"Civilise Your Caveman\". In the 1960s - sporting long, dyed-blonde hair and driving a car painted with giant flowers - she had her own TV chat show. \"I was a lousy journalist,\" she insists. \"I had no problem exaggerating or making up quotes. My colleagues thought they were being objective, but I never thought they were and I didn't even pretend.\" Flattered by a lunch invitation from Chile's Nobel poet laureate Pablo Neruda, she supposed she had been summoned to interview him. \"He laughed and said he would never allow himself to be interviewed by me; that I was the worst journalist and I only ever wrote about myself. But he was amused by my columns.\" At 19, Allende married an Anglo-Chilean engineering student with whom she lived for 25 years and had two children. She says she served him \"like a geisha\". \"It was the way a Latin American woman served a man, but I exaggerated, because all my life is about exaggeration. I had three jobs. We had a car; he'd take it, and I'd go on the bus with the grocery, then come running home to serve him a drink. I thought I was a feminist, but I was raising the children alone; my husband never changed a diaper. I never applied the theory to my practical life.\" Though not \"political\" like her Allende cousins, she chaffed against not only male prerogatives (\"I'd wanted to be a man since I was five\") but an impervious hierarchy that was partly racial: the more Indian the blood, the lower the class. \"I'm fascinated with how you can break a system, defy and challenge it. As a woman, that's determined my life,\" she says. \"I was brought up seeing the injustice of a class system; the poor didn't have a chance. The people who had control for generations had impunity. It was very hard to change society when I was growing up, though it happened with Salvador Allende.\" While she regrets not having done more for her uncle's short-lived regime, the military coup when she was 31 awoke her to \"the amount of evil that was possible\". \"I was a very frivolous person; involved in women's issues and feminism but not politics. In my humorous columns or TV programme I was always looking for the ironic and funny; I failed to see the tragedy brewing in my country.\" But in the first 48 hours after the coup, her \"perpetual innocence, extended adolescence\" were shattered. \"My husband, who was in the construction business, had to take food to workers stranded by the curfew. We went out slowly in the car, with a white flag, and were stopped 10 or 20 times. Driving through the streets, I could see corpses, and books being burned, and people dragged into trucks, running with blood.\" Partly because she was an Allende and a familiar face on television, she found herself called on to help the resistance. \"Through friends in the church, I smuggled information and hid people in my house before they could be taken to the border or, when that became unsafe, to asylum in embassies.\" The experience is most closely reflected in her second novel, Of Love And Shadows, in which a fashion journalist is drawn into the resistance after falling for a photographer. Though Allende had initially refused safe passage offered by the Mexican embassy, after 14 months of the terror she fled. \"By then I'd been fired from my job, and I was on a list. I couldn't take the fear for my family any more.\" Her husband joined her in Caracas when it became clear she could not return. Despite hardship, Venezuela was liberating. \"I'd come from a country where we dress in grey and pretend we're British, to a place enjoying the oil boom, where there was an erotic charge in the streets.\" The House Of The Spirits was begun on January 8 (Allende has since started all her books on the same date) as a letter to her dying grandfather, the model for its landowner and conservative senator Esteban Trueba, who backs the coup but becomes sickened by its brutality. His wife Clara was modelled on Allende's grandmother, a disciple of Madame Blavatsky who experimented with telepathy (\"she didn't trust the mail\"). While her daughter Blanca has a taboo romance with a young worker on El Patr\u00f3n's estate, her granddaughter Alba smuggles dissidents to sanctuary. \"I've worked with and for woman all my life and have known very few weak women,\" says Allende. \"In Latin American literature of the 60s and 70s boom, female protagonists were stereotypes, cliches - the prostitute, bride, mother - because that generation of men were brought up segregated from women.\" First published in Spain, the novel has elements of a style more associated with the Caribbean tropics - Alejo Carpentier's Cuba or Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's Colombian coast - than the Andes. Yet Allende has long ceased to be flattered by comparisons with the Nobel laureate - made, she says, only by anglophone critics. \"This always happens to women when they do anything creative; they need a male model to validate them. If I were a man, no one would be comparing me to anybody.\" For her, magical realism has been present across the world, from African and Arab tales, to Scandinavian sagas and Gothic novels. \"In the literary world of white males, the restrictive, rational literature written lately in industrialised nations, reality needs to be explained, controlled. With women of the same period there's a sense of magic, because we can't control things. As a writer I accept everything is possible; layers of truth and belief and the subjective - dreams, coincidences, fears, obsessions. All that gives texture to writing.\" Manguel, who dismisses the notion of a Latin American boom as \"an illiterate critical movement in the Anglo-Saxon world when everyone was read through the filter of Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\", rejects the view of Allende as derivative. \"The whole of literature written in Spanish either has an element of fantasy or is documentary, and these borders were crossed. Allende reflects the reality she knows, with an element that is not logical or rational, in a playful way.\" In The House Of The Spirits, myth and fact are fused (Salvador Allende appears as The Candidate and Pablo Neruda as The Poet), Allende blurring memory and imagination to overcome homesickness. \"I do invent memories. My grandmother died when I was so young, but people have told me I had a need to have a grandmother, so I used imagination and wishful thinking.\" The fantasy is seldom literal. (Of the film, shot in Denmark, Allende says: \"I missed the book's sense of humour, the irony - the movie had a Scandinavian gloom.\") She abandoned fantasy in Of Love And Shadows, which chronicled the real discovery of bodies of some of the \"disappeared\" in a disused mineshaft in 1978, and was written \"out of anger\". Yet in Eva Luna, about an Amerindian Sheherazade turned scriptwriter, and \"a celebration of being a woman and a storyteller\", she restored it with elements of kitsch borrowed from Latin soap opera, the telenovela . Antonio Sk\u00e1rmeta, the Chilean author on whose novel the film Il Postino was based, is writing a screenplay of Eva Luna for the same director, Michael Radford. \"Isabel makes fun of the telenovela, like all intellectuals do,\" Sk\u00e1rmeta says. \"But she has a tenderness towards the genre because people love and follow it.\" Allende's marriage faltered as she was succeeding as a writer. She went off on an affair with a musician in Madrid, but after three months she returned to Caracas. She divorced in 1987. \"Maybe I grew in a different direction. I wanted passion in my life. It wasn't infidelity or fights. We never slammed a door.\" Within months, she had met her second husband while on a book tour in California. William Gordon, an Irish-American lawyer contesting insurance companies for the \"small man\", grew up in the Los Angeles barrio (\"He thinks he speaks Spanish,\" Allende sniffs). He became the model for Gregory Reeves in her California-set novel The Infinite Plan, about a post-Vietnam generation \"defeated by the American dream\". While Allende was promoting the book in Spain her daughter Paula fell ill with porphyria, a hormonal disorder that is rarely fatal, but which left her in a coma. After six months in intensive care, she seemed strong enough to breathe without life support. \"She started breathing on her own, so we took her home to California and then western medicine gave up on her. For the six months till she died we tried everything: acupuncture, herbs, psychics, magnets, Shamanism, anything that might make her comfortable and that was not invasive. She'd already had enough pain.\" Alternative medicine is explored in Daughter Of Fortune, through the character of the Chinese physician Tao Chi'en, with whom Eliza slowly falls in love. But the book was halted by Paula's illness and death in December 1992. \"I thought I was never going to write again,\" Allende says. \"I had to pull myself out of a writer's block and very dark depression. I just went to hell; it's a moment of grief you can't avoid and can't make better. I tried Prozac; it didn't work - I'd rather be in pain. Nothing helps except time, but you start drawing from an inside strength, a resilience you didn't know you had.\" While her daughter was ill, Allende wrote an extended letter to her, in the diminishing hope that she would one day read it. The letter grew into her memoir Paula, which she calls \"the most important book I will ever write, which has the greatest truth. Writing is exorcism. It deals with the demons of the past, sorts out the confusion. Life happens so fast there's no time to see the connections or consequences; there's too much noise everywhere. But in my work, there is no noise. Everything has a ripple effect in a book; in the years of introspection, I grow. For me, it's like meditation or prayer.\" While her mother was aghast at the disclosure of \"family secrets\", Allende even added snatches of love letters between Paula and her husband of only a year, Ernesto. He consented to Isabel's taking Paula home to California because she was better able to care for her, with nurses. \"Ernesto called me on the phone, crying, saying 'Paula was different, you only knew her as a mother'. He sent me love letters they'd exchanged, revealing aspects of my daughter I didn't suspect. To me she was mainly intellectual, a brain. But she was emotionally immature, very dependent and - I was embarrassed - very passionate sexually.\" Austere yet full of lyrical flights of memory, interspersed with bulletins from her daughter's bedside, Paula has been seen as Allende's masterpiece and brought her a new readership. For her, \"it saved my life\". Yet she was unable to return to fiction, convinced \"that the world had lost its colour and that a universal greyness had spread inexorably over every surface\". She also had an experience mirrored in Eliza's asexual disguise. \"I turned 50 when Paula fell sick. Grief and menopause shut me down sexually and emotionally. I look at pictures and see I aged 10 years. I couldn't laugh. To me, sensuality is related to humour, and if I can't laugh, I can't make love. Maybe I felt that my daughter had all the right to be healthy and have sex. It was so hard to think of myself making love when she couldn't.\" It took three years for her to emerge from a tunnel of mourning. Aphrodite: A Memoir Of The Senses signalled a reviving interest in the sensual (she had erotic dreams about a \"salsa-smeared Antonio Banderas rolling naked on a tortilla\"). A playful meditation on aphrodisiacs - the \"bridge between gluttony and lust, interspersed with recipes\" - it helped her return to life and to fiction, though she reflects: \"I've changed because I have a sort of detachment now; I know how little I can control in my life or of others' safety and happiness, though to learn to love without trying to control the environment is hard.\" Her husband's daughter from a previous marriage - she had been a drug addict - also died around the time of Paula's death, a double blow that threatened to push them apart. \"We were so wounded we both retreated because we were vulnerable.\" Therapy helped. She says: \"Till recently a husband to me was an addendum who didn't share anything important - my work, insecurities, grief. With my second husband I've learned what love in a partnership is; to surrender, rely on and receive from another person - though I'm not dumping myself in anyone's lap.\" Settled in San Rafael, in northern California's affluent Marin county (she works in an office in a tower at her husband's law firm), Allende has attacked an \"apartheid\" where Latinos exist \"to care for children and wash cars, but people want them to disappear like ghosts at night\". In Daughter Of Fortune she explores people's impulse to reinvent themselves in a new land while tracing incipient hostilities between Yanquis and Latinos after the war in 1846-8 that forced Mexico to cede to the US territory where gold had been found only days before. \"I'm an immigrant myself. I live in an area with a large immigrant population - though I'm privileged: I'm legal and speak some English; I'm married to an American and can support myself.\" While some see her as having opened doors in the US for other Latina writers - Laura Esquival, Cristina Garc\u00eda, Sandra Cisneros - Allende senses changes in her own fiction. \"I speak less Spanish and my writing is becoming less baroque; I use fewer adjectives.\" Her mother, now 79, remains her editor, referring to her daughter's works as \"ours\", and rooting out the Spanglish words creeping into her prose (\"Her first comments are horrible, very negative\"). She lives in Chile where Allende often visits her. They have kept up an almost daily correspondence for 35 years. \"She's becoming smarter with age. I can't imagine what it will be like without her.\" Allende has now found a \"sisterhood\" in other US writers, such as Amy Tan, Barbara Kingsolver, Alice Walker and Louise Erdrich. At last, she says she feels settled. \"It was hard the first time [in Venezuela] because we didn't have the right state of mind. We were always looking south and never quite unpacked; I never expected the dictatorship to last 17 years.\" Since the amnesty of 1988, Allende has visited Chile often, where she is top of the bestseller lists, and says that even if Pinochet is freed by Britain after 15 months house arrest, and never faces trial, \"justice has been done; he's a pariah and an embarrassment, even to the right\" - though she adds with a shrewd stab of irony: \"I only hope he doesn't make a miraculous recovery and go back to sitting in the senate.\" She asks emotionally why his medical record should be kept secret when women raped under his regime were stripped of this privacy. Yet she also insists she no longer hates Pinochet. \"I realised 20 years ago that hatred is a very heavy burden. I'd still fight for what's truthful, but this is not about him but about grief that needs to be acknowledged for true reconciliation to take place.\" Her writing has sought to recover a place lost not only through exile but through childhood separation from Chile as a diplomat's daughter. \"In Chile I realise I'm a foreigner, even though I understand the codes and can speak with my own accent, and it's very sad for me to confront that,\" Allende says. \"I'm a foreigner in the US, too, and always will be. But my roots are more in my books now than in a place; my home will be in my writing.\" Life at a glance: Isabel Allende Born: August 8 1942, Lima, Peru.

The leader of Austria's far right Freedom party wants to offer an olive branch to opponents by acknowledging and apologising for Nazi crimes, said Roberto Antonione, an ally and president of Italy's Friuli-Venezia-Giulia region. Mr Haider may travel this month to Risiera di San Sabba, where the Nazis murdered 5,000 people and disposed of their bodies in a crematorium. \"I see it as an important occasion, not only for relations with a good neighbour but as sending a conciliatory signal and a clear message of peace with the community of Friuli-Venezia-Giulia,\" Mr Haider wrote to Mr Antonione. However, Umberto Piperno, the chief rabbi for Trieste, the region's capital, said the presence of a man who has praised the Waffen SS and Hitler's em ployment policies was unacceptable. Mr Piperno denied reports that he had invited Mr Haider to visit the site. Local media had misquoted him and right-wing politicians had manipulated the confusion to entice Mr Haider, he said. \"What I said is that Haider should tell his supporters and the youth of Austria about Nazi crimes such as the ones committed at the extermination camp at the Risiera di San Sabba. I never said he should visit Trieste, and certainly not San Sabba, where his presence would be unacceptable.\" An apology for war crimes would no longer be welcome, Mr Piperno said. \"No, not now.\" No confirmation of the visit has come from Mr Haider, but Mr Antonione insisted that the Freedom party leader had faxed a letter expressing a \"sincere interest\" in coming. The controversy fuelled an increasingly bitter row in Italy about how to respond to the new Austrian government. The centre-left government of the prime minister, Massimo D'Alema, has taken a hardline stance against Austria, but opposition groups have split. Police broke up a protest in support of Mr Haider in front of Mr D'Alema's office in Rome on Thursday. Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate and leader of the centre-right opposition, has attempted to put clear blue water between himself and Mr Haider, who shares his hostility to immigration. Mr Berlusconi has condemned Mr Haider but has been unable to control his fractious coalition's enthusiasm, especially that of the leader of the Northern League, Umberto Bossi. To Mr Berlusconi's mortification, senior members of his own Forza Italia party have joined the league in praising Mr Haider. So far he has resisted pressure to disown them.

Twenty-five police were injured.</p> <p>President Thomas Klestil appealed for calm in a country which has rarely seen such anger. He called on the world to \"give the new government a chance and judge it by what it does\". But he warned the chancellor, Wolfgang Sch\u00fcssel, and his coalition partner, the populist Freedom party leader J\u00f6rg Haider, that if it strayed from guidelines he had made it underwrite \"it would have a serious impact at home and abroad\".</p> <p>The US joined European nations in limiting contact with the new administration, but the secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, said further judgement would be made \"on deeds not words\". Her colleague, the defence secretary, William Cohen, sounded a more ominous note. On a tour of Germany, he said the new government \"might be a step back into a very dark past\".</p> <p>Mr Klestil delivered his warning after Mr Haider, who will hold the government's fate in his hands, had questioned the need for the commitment he and the new chancellor had signed. It pledged Austria to respect basic human rights and to re-examine its Nazi past. \"It is an affront to the public that such matters of course have to be signed,\" Mr Haider said.</p> <p>The high emotions were highlighted at a ceremony at which the outgoing Social Democrat chancellor bade farewell. Viktor Klima appeared to be on the verge of tears and several of his staff openly wept.</p> <p>Outside the imperial palace, while ministers were taking their oaths of office, demonstrators were baton-charged. They later stormed the social affairs ministry, demanding to see the new Freedom party minister.</p> <p>There was little evidence, however, that the more moderate elements in the government had grasped the reasons for the fury. The foreign minister, Benita Ferrero-Waldner, said: \"There is nothing in Austria which justifies this, apart from a couple of unpleasant comments by Mr Haider.\"</p> <p>Contrary to early reports that the Freedom party had secured most seats in cabinet, agriculture went to the conservatives, giving them an equal share . However, Mr Haider's supporters will control the key spending departments.</p> <p>Mr Haider, who is not in the government but can bring it down when he likes, has praised Hitler's \"orderly employment policies\" and lauded Waffen SS veterans. He has since apologised for the remarks \"which were attributed to me\"; yesterday, though, he was in defiant mood. \"I have no intention of wandering around world apologising for all kinds of things,\" he said.</p> <p>The most extreme reprisal came from Israel, whose ambassador, Nathan Meron, left Austria yesterday on the orders of the prime minister, Ehud Barak. Finland suspended relations andBelgium put its ties on a lower footing. France's defence minister postponed a meeting with his Austrian counterpart and his depart ment struck the first economic blow by cancelling an order for six Austrian ambulances.</p> <p>Austria's president meanwhile took every opportunity to stress his dismay. He barely looked at Mr Sch\u00fcssel as he swore him in and kept eye contact with the new ministers to a minimum, giving the briefest of handshakes.</p> <p>In a letter to the Los Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal centre, which tracks down Nazi war criminals, Mr Klestil insisted he had no choice but to appoint the coalition, whose members had won a majority in the lower house.</p> <p>Mr Haider said his party had achieved an historic change \"despite the attempted influence from abroad and violence on the streets\". He expected the protests to calm down soon.</p>",

President Thomas Klestil appealed for calm in a country which has rarely seen such anger. He called on the world to \"give the new government a chance and judge it by what it does\". But he warned the chancellor, Wolfgang Sch\u00fcssel, and his coalition partner, the populist Freedom party leader J\u00f6rg Haider, that if it strayed from guidelines he had made it underwrite \"it would have a serious impact at home and abroad\". The US joined European nations in limiting contact with the new administration, but the secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, said further judgement would be made \"on deeds not words\". Her colleague, the defence secretary, William Cohen, sounded a more ominous note. On a tour of Germany, he said the new government \"might be a step back into a very dark past\". Mr Klestil delivered his warning after Mr Haider, who will hold the government's fate in his hands, had questioned the need for the commitment he and the new chancellor had signed. It pledged Austria to respect basic human rights and to re-examine its Nazi past. \"It is an affront to the public that such matters of course have to be signed,\" Mr Haider said. The high emotions were highlighted at a ceremony at which the outgoing Social Democrat chancellor bade farewell. Viktor Klima appeared to be on the verge of tears and several of his staff openly wept. Outside the imperial palace, while ministers were taking their oaths of office, demonstrators were baton-charged. They later stormed the social affairs ministry, demanding to see the new Freedom party minister. There was little evidence, however, that the more moderate elements in the government had grasped the reasons for the fury. The foreign minister, Benita Ferrero-Waldner, said: \"There is nothing in Austria which justifies this, apart from a couple of unpleasant comments by Mr Haider.\" Contrary to early reports that the Freedom party had secured most seats in cabinet, agriculture went to the conservatives, giving them an equal share . However, Mr Haider's supporters will control the key spending departments. Mr Haider, who is not in the government but can bring it down when he likes, has praised Hitler's \"orderly employment policies\" and lauded Waffen SS veterans. He has since apologised for the remarks \"which were attributed to me\"; yesterday, though, he was in defiant mood. \"I have no intention of wandering around world apologising for all kinds of things,\" he said. The most extreme reprisal came from Israel, whose ambassador, Nathan Meron, left Austria yesterday on the orders of the prime minister, Ehud Barak. Finland suspended relations andBelgium put its ties on a lower footing. France's defence minister postponed a meeting with his Austrian counterpart and his depart ment struck the first economic blow by cancelling an order for six Austrian ambulances. Austria's president meanwhile took every opportunity to stress his dismay. He barely looked at Mr Sch\u00fcssel as he swore him in and kept eye contact with the new ministers to a minimum, giving the briefest of handshakes. In a letter to the Los Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal centre, which tracks down Nazi war criminals, Mr Klestil insisted he had no choice but to appoint the coalition, whose members had won a majority in the lower house. Mr Haider said his party had achieved an historic change \"despite the attempted influence from abroad and violence on the streets\". He expected the protests to calm down soon.",

      "body": "<p>BSkyB's managing director, Elizabeth Murdoch, and Manchester United's chief executive, Martin Edwards, head a list of nine individuals who were last night celebrating making paper millions from the first day of trading in the shares of internet incubator fund Oxygen Holdings. </p> <p>Shares in Oxygen soared to 65p by mid-morning yesterday, a 3,250% increase on the 2p placement price. It valued the Aim-listed company at around \u00a3240m. The shares eventually closed at 57.5p. </p> <p>Oxygen aims to invest in early stage internet companies. So far it has spent around \u00a31m on stakeholdings in five start-ups, investing around \u00a3200,000 each time. </p> <p>The jump in the share price was driven by strong demand among private investors desperate to buy the very small amount of stock Oxygen made available to outside parties. </p> <p>By the end of trading Ms Murdoch, daughter of News Corporation owner Rupert Murdoch and a member of Oxygen's investment committee, found the 3m share options she has been granted notionally worth \u00a31.7m. </p> <p>However, she is unable to exercise her options for at least three years. Mr Edwards' 3.7% stake was worth \u00a38m. </p> <p>Oxygen is chaired by Michael Edelson and advisers to the company said the performance of Mr Edelson's last vehicle, Knutsford, had partly prompted the dash for shares. </p> <p>Knutsford made stock market news last year when Archie Norman, Nigel Wray, Julian Richer and Nick Leslau announced they were going to use it as a base from which to bid for a large retail company. </p> <p>The shares soared from 5p to 240p on the news but have since slipped back to 140p after a failed takeover bid and negative comment. </p> <p>A spokesman for Oxygen said: \"The company is obviously delighted by today's performance but it hasn't affected in any way what they intend to do or the amount of money available to them.\" </p> <p>She added that dozens of students drop out of university each year to run businesses, and Oxygen's aim was to provide them with the capital and expertise to allow them to complete their studies. </p> <p>The Edelson family were the largest beneficiaries of yesterday's rise, with the combined holdings of Mr Edelson and his two daughters Emma, 26, and Laura, 22, worth \u00a339m. Emma, a Cambridge graduate, is to co-ordinate Oxygen's attempts to search out investments from campuses across the country. </p> <p>She and three colleagues, all 26 or under, will submit the best ideas to the investment committee and Oxygen's other directors Keith Harris and Matthew Freud. </p> <p>Mr Freud, Ms Murdoch's partner and a PR executive who acts for singer Geri Halliwell, has shares in Oxygen worth \u00a311m while former corporate financier Mr Harris has the largest individual stake of \u00a322m. Former footballers Alan Hansen and Steve Bruce are also stock owners. Three other investors also found their stakes worth over \u00a31m.</p>",

      "bodyText": "BSkyB's managing director, Elizabeth Murdoch, and Manchester United's chief executive, Martin Edwards, head a list of nine individuals who were last night celebrating making paper millions from the first day of trading in the shares of internet incubator fund Oxygen Holdings. Shares in Oxygen soared to 65p by mid-morning yesterday, a 3,250% increase on the 2p placement price. It valued the Aim-listed company at around \u00a3240m. The shares eventually closed at 57.5p. Oxygen aims to invest in early stage internet companies. So far it has spent around \u00a31m on stakeholdings in five start-ups, investing around \u00a3200,000 each time. The jump in the share price was driven by strong demand among private investors desperate to buy the very small amount of stock Oxygen made available to outside parties. By the end of trading Ms Murdoch, daughter of News Corporation owner Rupert Murdoch and a member of Oxygen's investment committee, found the 3m share options she has been granted notionally worth \u00a31.7m. However, she is unable to exercise her options for at least three years. Mr Edwards' 3.7% stake was worth \u00a38m. Oxygen is chaired by Michael Edelson and advisers to the company said the performance of Mr Edelson's last vehicle, Knutsford, had partly prompted the dash for shares. Knutsford made stock market news last year when Archie Norman, Nigel Wray, Julian Richer and Nick Leslau announced they were going to use it as a base from which to bid for a large retail company. The shares soared from 5p to 240p on the news but have since slipped back to 140p after a failed takeover bid and negative comment. A spokesman for Oxygen said: \"The company is obviously delighted by today's performance but it hasn't affected in any way what they intend to do or the amount of money available to them.\" She added that dozens of students drop out of university each year to run businesses, and Oxygen's aim was to provide them with the capital and expertise to allow them to complete their studies. The Edelson family were the largest beneficiaries of yesterday's rise, with the combined holdings of Mr Edelson and his two daughters Emma, 26, and Laura, 22, worth \u00a339m. Emma, a Cambridge graduate, is to co-ordinate Oxygen's attempts to search out investments from campuses across the country. She and three colleagues, all 26 or under, will submit the best ideas to the investment committee and Oxygen's other directors Keith Harris and Matthew Freud. Mr Freud, Ms Murdoch's partner and a PR executive who acts for singer Geri Halliwell, has shares in Oxygen worth \u00a311m while former corporate financier Mr Harris has the largest individual stake of \u00a322m. Former footballers Alan Hansen and Steve Bruce are also stock owners. Three other investors also found their stakes worth over \u00a31m.",

      "bodyText": "The following is an edited version of the report by the Conservative ethics and integrity committee which last night led to Lord Archer's suspension from the party for five years 1. On November 22 1999 the party leader William Hague referred to the committee the complaint that Lord Archer had brought the party into disrepute. The complaint was based on the assurance given by Lord Archer to the party chairman on June 22 1999 that there were \"no new, substantial and damaging allegations\" which could be made against him which would merit referral to the committee. 2. The committee was asked to consider Lord Archer's apparent admission that he had fabricated a false alibi for possible use in court: the evidence provided by Ted Francis in the form of a letter to Lord Archer's solicitors for possible use in Lord Archer's libel action against the Daily Star in 1987. 3. The context in which the reference was made by the leader is the resignation of Lord Archer as the party's mayoral candidate on November 18 1999. 4. The ethics and integrity committee has concluded: (1) Lord Archer has engaged in conduct which brought the party into disrepute. (2) The appropriate sanction which should be imposed is expulsion from the party for five years. In reaching these conclusions the committee has take into account the evidence which Lord Archer gave and the submissions made on his behalf. On January 28 2000 the committee invited representations from Lord Archer's legal advisers. These were received on February 1 2000. The committee has carefully considered these representations, but does not consider that there is any basis for changing its conclusions. 5. Since Lord Archer has admitted to the committee that he did procure the fabrication of a false alibi by Mr Ted Francis, that particular issue, namely, whether Lord Archer \"apparently\" fabricated a false alibi has been resolved. 6. The significance to the committee of this admission was its timing, and the weight to be given to the submission made by Lord Archer's legal advisers, that conduct which occurred so long ago was stale and should not be entertained by the committee under its own rules of procedure. 7. First, timing. The admission which was made by Lord Archer was made in November 1999. It was not prompted by any pang of conscience, but by the prospect of his imminent disgrace by the public disclosure of conduct which had never before been revealed. Lord Archer was at the relevant time the party's adopted mayoral candidate. He had, prior to adoption as the party's candidate, given the assurance sought by the party chairman on June 22 1999. But for the assurance that he gave, he would not have passed the particular vetting stage which ultimately led to his selection. 8. Secondly, the submission that the conduct complained of was too old or stale. The critical difference to be drawn is between conduct which has been in the public domain and conduct which has not. The fabrication of a false alibi was conduct which had been concealed by Lord Archer. It had not been in the public domain. It consequently was not conduct which was stale or old. 9. The conduct which Lord Archer had engaged in was conduct which, once revealed, was new and damaging to the party. It was not conduct which could be dismissed merely because it was stale. The critical point, overlooked by Lord Archer's advisers, is that conduct whenever engaged in, which has been concealed, becomes new conduct when revealed publicly. It is the element of concealment which also makes what Lord Archer had done in order to promote his personal ambitions the more reprehensible. 10. On June 22 1999 Lord Archer assured the party chairman that no new, substantial and damaging allegations could be made against him which would merit referral to the committee. 11. The committee is satisfied that the categoric assur ance given by Lord Archer to the party chairman was untrue. The committee is also satisfied that Lord Archer knew or must have known when he gave the categoric assurance which he did, that if it was disclosed the party would be brought into disrepute. 12. The fabrication of a false alibi for possible use in court was conduct engaged in by Lord Archer, which was dishonest and disreputable and would be regarded as such by the party. It would be so regarded by any right-minded person. It is immaterial that the evidence was not used. 13. The committee notes that Lord Archer, on November 4 1999, when he was alerted by Mr Ted Francis to the possibility that his conduct would be made public, did not make a clean breast of it. Instead he took steps to ensure that this would remain hidden. He only resigned on November 19 1999 when he knew that disclosure was inevitable. 14. The committee is in no doubt that the revelation that Lord Archer had procured the fabrication of a false alibi, his admission that he had done so and his resignation as the party's mayoral candidate brought the party into disrepute. 15. On November 4, 9 and 12 1999 there were a number of conversations between Lord Archer and Mr Ted Francis on the subject of the false alibi. The transcripts of those conversations, which were published in the News of the World on November 28 1999, were accepted by Lord Archer as an accurate record of what was said. Lord Archer revealed, in the committee's view, a vivid recollection of those events. The fabrication of false evidence would not be a matter which an ordinary man would be likely to forget. Lord Archer proved to be no exception, although he sought to deny any recollection of what he had done when he gave his assurance to the party chairman on 22 June 1999 that he had nothing to hide. 16. The principal explanation proffered by Lord Archer for the fabrication of a false alibi was to protect the identity of a lady companion. On behalf of Lord Archer it was suggested that while this conduct was not excusable, it was understandable because of the intrusion by the press into every aspect of Lord Archer's life. This was not accepted by the committee. 17. The matters which were urged on the committee on behalf of Lord Archer as ameliorating the consequences of his conduct to the party served merely to emphasise the prominence which Lord Archer had achieved in the party and, consequently, to highlight the extent to which Lord Archer had brought the party into disrepute. 18. The committee has had in mind the principle of proportionality, namely that in the exercise of its powers, the committee should reflect the nature and blameworthiness of the conduct which brought the party into disrepute by imposing appropriate sanction. The committee had taken full account of all the matters which have been urged on it on Lord Archer's behalf. But for Lord Archer's long record of service, the committee would have been prepared to impose a longer period of expulsion. The determination of the committee, having addressed the leader's reference dated November 22 1999, is that Lord Archer did engage in conduct which brought the party into disrepute and that he should be expelled from the party for five years.",

His hands shaking with grief, Umar Tashayev was unable to talk, instead writing on a scrap of paper about what happened when a rebel column blundered into the minefield as it tried to escape from Grozny this week after months of fighting in the Chechen capital. \"I saw dreadful things during fighting in Grozny, but that massacre was beyond comparison,\" he wrote of Monday's breakout of some 2,000 rebels from Grozny. Khamzat Tisayev, wounded in the foot, said some fighters sacrificed themselves to clear a path, running ahead to deliberately set off mines. \"The boys marched on mines and shouted to us: 'Meet you in paradise!'\" The carnage, which left some 600, including several prominent warlords, dead or badly wounded, was the bloodiest loss for the rebels since Russian forces moved into Chechnya in September. The Russians claim they lured the rebels into a trap by pretending to sell them safe passage out of Grozny for $100,000, and finished most of them off with artillery barrages. The limited rebel escape was a setback for the Russian military, who had based their strategy on wiping out the insurgents in Grozny and ending the war. The remaining rebels are determined to fight on. Before venturing out of Grozny, rebel commanders sent a party ahead. It never returned, but Aslanbek Ismailov, who was in charge of Grozny defences, decided to leave anyway. He and other leaders decided to lead the column. Lyoma Dadayev, a fighter who survived the march, said one commander, Shamil Basayev, turned to his men and said: \"Women often tell us, 'You let our sons be killed while you stay alive.' Well, we shall go first.\" Ismailov died in the first explosions. After the first mines exploded, Russian artillery shells and rockets screamed into the rebel column, killing scores. The rebels pressed on, leaving their dead and wounded behind, contrary to custom. Some still shudder at the memory. \"I was pulling my comrade on a sledge, and then was hit in my leg by a fragment,\" Mr Dadayev said. \"I had to leave him behind, because otherwise I would have died too.\" Mr Tashayev wrote: \"Our wounded comrades pleaded with us not to leave them, but we had to keep going.\" It was late on Monday morning when rebels, clad in winter camouflage, reached Alkhan-Kala, south-west of Grozny.

Baiyev, the hospital chief, conducted amputations with a hacksaw and no painkillers or antiseptics. Villagers quickly took most of the wounded to their homes, where the fighters lay without any medicine to ease the pain of their wounds. A smell of rotting flesh filled a room in house where two rebels were lying, their feet amputated. \"These people don't know that they have gangrene and are doomed,\" Dr Malika Sabiyeva whispered, turning away from the wounded men. \"We don't know what to do, we have nothing to help them.\"",

      "body": "<p>My friend's pregnant again. Fifth time in six years, all by the same man, and she's already chosen her next abortionist. Last time, it took 50 minutes from anaesthetic to home-time, and she felt so chirpy afterwards that she walked home and called me as she passed an Italian deli to see if I wanted anything. She is also half of the most devoted couple I know: six years, never a cross word that's not easily solved with a pen and thesaurus, and marriage on the cards. They go on holiday one hell of a lot - and I'm speaking as someone who took five last year. They've been together longer than anyone I know. Why? \"Because we don't have children. I know it sounds odd, but it's like every abortion brings us closer.\" </p> <p>\"Don't you ever feel sort of weird, not even when you see really adorable babies in prams? Don't you ever feel sorry you had the last abortion, say?\" Predictably, having turned 40 and buried my mother, I can't think of anything I'd like more than another baby. Women! </p> <p>\"No, but I'll tell you one thing for sure: there isn't a day that passes that I don't see at least one child who makes me thank God I've had four abortions, and vow to have four more, if I have to. When did all children start acting as if they're auditioning for The Exorcist?\" </p> <p>\"What about X?\" X is her boyfriend, a mature dreamboat with no apparent horn-buds or cloven hooves. \"Doesn't he ever feel regretful?\" </p> <p>\"Don't be silly! I told you, X has three grown-up children from his first marriage. He said they're the reason it broke up. He was mad about his wife, then the children ruined everything. He says he's not in a hurry to lose another woman he loves that way.\" Her pretty face clouded. \"I was feeling a bit wavery, actually. Then we went to Barbados. There were loads of families there. It was horrible, all these couples sitting there for hours, not speaking a word to each other, and the kids, like little jailers, demanding things non-stop. It was incredible to think that these people had originally been drawn together through attraction and sex. X just smiled at me sort of sadly and said, 'See?' When we came back, it was my New Year's resolution to start reading newspapers, not magazines.\" </p> <p>She shuddered. \"And I remembered that thing Sharon Stone said when reporters wouldn't stop asking if she was pregnant: 'Climb out of my uterus, will ya?'\" My friend shook her head. \"It seems to me that when you have a relationship it's private; it's your business. But the moment you're pregnant, suddenly everybody thinks it's their business. It's public. And everyone knows that public relationships never last.\" </p> <p>She's got a point. It's like the whole world, led by the media, has become one big interfering mother-in-law, forever coming forward and putting their oar in. We have all but abolished socialised childcare and the nanny state, but the organs of right-wing opinion have decided that women's bodies, once they have conceived, are nevertheless public property. </p> <p>The fact that having children is a real laugh - I still think back to the infanthood of my second son as the happiest days of my life - has been totally lost in the static of censure. Everyone's got an opinion, especially those who don't have a womb. I wouldn't trust any of them, especially that alleged \"feminist\", Dr Michel Odent, who recently suggested that men should stay out of the delivery room. Yeah, so male doctors feel free to deprive the putative mother of the pain-killing drugs that the Odent tendency consider so wicked! This is the same Odent, don't forget, who last year suggested that women should devote themselves utterly to their children for the first few years after birth, while encouraging their husbands to pursue sex with other women! Funny, I didn't know that that was being a feminist; I thought it was being a Frenchman. </p> <p>Women who work damage their children, says Panorama. Women who have affairs damage their children, says the Guardian. Women who drink even one glass of wine damage their children, say the doctors. Women who use technology to defer childbirth until they are settled and solvent damage their children, says the Mail in a fascinating about-face from a newspaper that previously prized social responsibility and self-reliance above all else, and spent decades demonising \"natural\" teenage single mothers. (The Mail is extremely keen on Bad Mothers, which must be why, after calling me \"The Worst Mother In Britain\" last year, it is now paying me \u00a32 per word - must be those Wages Of Sin you hear about.) </p> <p>On the other hand, says the equally strident evidence, simply by being born, children damage their mothers. Mothers are twice as likely to be depressed as non-mothers, and were recently discovered to be far less optimistic about the future. In a final, ironic twist, it appears that Mother Nature - since time immemorial the final authority to which the Family Values brigade resort - actually programmes women sexually to shut down on their husbands four years after the first child has been produced, and to stray elsewhere. If that doesn't happen, a third child will finish a marriage more often than not, anyway. DNA testing, meanwhile, has revealed that one in 10 children is sending the card to the wrong man on Father's Day. </p> <p>But if the organs of the silent majority - Panorama, the Mail and the rest - really want women to start enthusiastically replenishing and caring for the nation's stock once more, I suggest they call a moratorium on the Bad Mother issue. Otherwise, the number of very young women asking to be sterilised will continue to rise and rise. The fact that having a baby in the house is, under the right circumstances, about as much fun as you can have while someone's throwing up on you, is being lost in the maelstrom of wagging fingers. </p> <p> You won't get girls to behave like adults - to reproduce - simply by treating them like children, scolding them and lecturing them, over and over, until they decide to shut down out of sheer mulish stubbornness. Having a baby, at the end of the day, remains a young woman's own personal decision. No newspaper or government, no matter how mad and reactionary, would ever dare suggest a programme of mass rape, or even financial reward, as the monumentally sexist French did just after the war in order to replenish the stock. </p> <p>If we don't stop making young women of child- bearing age feel that motherhood is a permanent test that they will never measure up to, these women will simply stop reproducing. There are, after all, so many other things for women to do these days. In seeking to guide the cream of child-bearing women into the ways of righteousness, we will instead have killed the goose that lays that shiniest of golden eggs: the future.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Some of the things Greg Dyke said in his first pep talk as director general of the BBC were music to the ears of those many members of staff who are disenchanted with Sir John Birt's management reforms. Dyke promised to cut down the number of the BBC's outside consultants by up to a half, to abolish various layers of management and administration, to eliminate the pointless internal bazaar in which producers are required to haggle with each other over the rental of things such as props and costumes, and to spend a much larger proportion of the corporation's \u00a32.8 billion income on making programmes. While Dyke insisted he would not be unpicking the Birtist reforms, he sounded very much as if that is just what he will be doing. The only part of Sir John's legacy that he seems genuinely to admire is the BBC's website, BBC Online, which he describes as \"well ahead of the field\".</p> <p>But the part of his talk that rightly made the headlines was his ultimatum to staff to stop moaning or leave. \"Please don't stay at the BBC and moan,\" he said. \"It damages the morale of the BBC internally and the reputation of the BBC outside. If you genuinely don't like the BBC, or don't think you'll like what it's going to be, please take control of your own life and go somewhere else.\" I was surprised to read that this was greeted with warm applause by his audience, for moaning has always been a British national pastime and should be enshrined in a Bill of Rights if we ever have one. How would most of us get through life if we weren't allowed to moan about the weather, about the traffic, about the railways, about the postal service, about the inland revenue, about everything in fact, and especially about the people who give us our living?</p> <p>As someone who has spent most of his life moaning, I feel most strongly about this. Moaning is what makes people feel free even when they are not. It nurtures individualism. It bestows dignity on the humblest wage slave. I am told that the employees of the Microsoft Corporation assemble once a year in a stadium somewhere and chant \"I love this company\". This, apparently, makes them feel good. But what distinguishes the British from most Americans and Japanese is that we shudder at such displays of corporate loyalty. Most of us are loyal in what we do - trying to serve the interests of our company and performing to the best of our ability at work - but we reserve the right to complain in private as much as we want. So we should. It is what makes us proper, independent people.</p> <p>It is possible, I admit, that journalists moan too much. They are egotists by nature and resent any attempts to clip their wings or cut them down to size. So they often complain unfairly about their editors, even about editors they admire. But I know of no evidence to suggest that moaning journalists are any less hard-working or any less good at their jobs than the non-moaning ones. It may even be the other way round. And I would venture to suggest that the sharp decline in the opportunities to moan caused by the disbandment of the old Fleet Street community, whose members used to gather regularly in pubs to slag off their bosses to each other, has had a dampening effect on general journalistic vitality.</p> <p>Greg Dyke, of course, is a supporter of New Labour, and he seems to be at one with Tony Blair in his belief that the country will only be successful if we all pull together in common cause. Their first error is to confuse moaning with a reluctance to do this, and their second error is to believe that they have a right to dictate what the cause should be. Blair made the great mistake of trying to depict early critics of the Millennium Dome as moaning ninnies without courage or vision. He wanted them to be thought of as petty and envious. But the moaners were right, and the prime minister was wrong. They ignored his threats, stuck to their guns, and have been thoroughly vindicated. The Dome is one of the great triumphs of British moaning.</p> <p>The other silly thing about Dyke's attack on moaning at the BBC is that he should imagine he has any power to stop it. We can be confident that his employees will carry on moaning as much as they ever did. They need to. It keeps them cheerful, and it fosters a spirit of worker solidarity. The more they moan, the more contented they will feel and the harder they will work. The more Dyke tries to stop them moaning, the more they are likely to want to take control of their own lives, as he puts it, and go somewhere else.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Some of the things Greg Dyke said in his first pep talk as director general of the BBC were music to the ears of those many members of staff who are disenchanted with Sir John Birt's management reforms. Dyke promised to cut down the number of the BBC's outside consultants by up to a half, to abolish various layers of management and administration, to eliminate the pointless internal bazaar in which producers are required to haggle with each other over the rental of things such as props and costumes, and to spend a much larger proportion of the corporation's \u00a32.8 billion income on making programmes. While Dyke insisted he would not be unpicking the Birtist reforms, he sounded very much as if that is just what he will be doing. The only part of Sir John's legacy that he seems genuinely to admire is the BBC's website, BBC Online, which he describes as \"well ahead of the field\". But the part of his talk that rightly made the headlines was his ultimatum to staff to stop moaning or leave. \"Please don't stay at the BBC and moan,\" he said. \"It damages the morale of the BBC internally and the reputation of the BBC outside. If you genuinely don't like the BBC, or don't think you'll like what it's going to be, please take control of your own life and go somewhere else.\" I was surprised to read that this was greeted with warm applause by his audience, for moaning has always been a British national pastime and should be enshrined in a Bill of Rights if we ever have one. How would most of us get through life if we weren't allowed to moan about the weather, about the traffic, about the railways, about the postal service, about the inland revenue, about everything in fact, and especially about the people who give us our living? As someone who has spent most of his life moaning, I feel most strongly about this. Moaning is what makes people feel free even when they are not. It nurtures individualism. It bestows dignity on the humblest wage slave. I am told that the employees of the Microsoft Corporation assemble once a year in a stadium somewhere and chant \"I love this company\". This, apparently, makes them feel good. But what distinguishes the British from most Americans and Japanese is that we shudder at such displays of corporate loyalty. Most of us are loyal in what we do - trying to serve the interests of our company and performing to the best of our ability at work - but we reserve the right to complain in private as much as we want. So we should. It is what makes us proper, independent people. It is possible, I admit, that journalists moan too much. They are egotists by nature and resent any attempts to clip their wings or cut them down to size. So they often complain unfairly about their editors, even about editors they admire. But I know of no evidence to suggest that moaning journalists are any less hard-working or any less good at their jobs than the non-moaning ones. It may even be the other way round. And I would venture to suggest that the sharp decline in the opportunities to moan caused by the disbandment of the old Fleet Street community, whose members used to gather regularly in pubs to slag off their bosses to each other, has had a dampening effect on general journalistic vitality. Greg Dyke, of course, is a supporter of New Labour, and he seems to be at one with Tony Blair in his belief that the country will only be successful if we all pull together in common cause. Their first error is to confuse moaning with a reluctance to do this, and their second error is to believe that they have a right to dictate what the cause should be. Blair made the great mistake of trying to depict early critics of the Millennium Dome as moaning ninnies without courage or vision. He wanted them to be thought of as petty and envious. But the moaners were right, and the prime minister was wrong. They ignored his threats, stuck to their guns, and have been thoroughly vindicated. The Dome is one of the great triumphs of British moaning. The other silly thing about Dyke's attack on moaning at the BBC is that he should imagine he has any power to stop it. We can be confident that his employees will carry on moaning as much as they ever did. They need to. It keeps them cheerful, and it fosters a spirit of worker solidarity. The more they moan, the more contented they will feel and the harder they will work. The more Dyke tries to stop them moaning, the more they are likely to want to take control of their own lives, as he puts it, and go somewhere else.",

The Mail has been the most monarchist of British publications. Yet the recent coverage of the couple would have fitted a republican publication. And the specific charge against them - that they are arrogant and privileged and fail to live like ordinary people - is a fascinating back-flip. What, after all, would be the point of monarchy, except to have more money, less humility and a more rarefied existence than other people?</p> <p>What's interesting about this week's pieces is that they had the effect of reading about a film star who you'd thought for some time was dead. In a way which seems astonishing even in comparison with 20 years ago, it is possible to go about your business for weeks or even months now in Britain without noticing there's a throne or a family on it. The only articles which bring them into the papers are carping ones. The Queen's golden jubilee in the year 2002 may be used to try to increase their visibility, but the royals could find themselves celebrating age and continuity in a culture increasingly devoted to youth and change.</p> <p>There have been four factors in this eclipse. The first is that Tony Blair has co-opted many of the ceremonial roles once entrusted to the throne and particularly in the areas of openings, mournings and symbolic utterances. His unusual youth has even allowed him to be the first prime minister to challenge the royals in breeding babies for the media and nation to adore.</p> <p>The loss of Diana - the show's one star - has also been significant, though not in the way predicted. It seemed briefly that the celebration of her might provide a platform for hostility to the monarchy. In fact, the reaction has been more like apathy. Finding the stage looking bare, many of the audience have simply torn up their tickets and left.</p> <p>Devolution has also played a part, as its architects in Scotland and Wales always knew it would but Tony Blair felt obliged to deny. A shrinking kingdom diminishes the monarch. It could logically have no other effect.</p> <p>And finally there is the problem - which Diana's death exacerbates - of the age and relative dullness of the central characters. The great and governing agony of the Prince of Wales's life is at a lesser level the difficulty for all monarchists. They are almost certainly in a long period - which may last for up to another 20 years - of waiting for something to happen. This is a problem which afflicts all systems which depend on posthumous succession in an age of sophisticated medical care.</p> <p>None of this means that an actual republic is close. At a time when political skill is defined as caution, the question is not going to be asked. Even if it were, there are at least two living British generations who grew up with enough flag-waving and commemorative crockery to vote a loud No in any poll. Indeed, the moment in the mid-90s - with the divorces and the concession on tax and the refusal to use public funds to rebuild Windsor Castle - when there seemed to be a momentum towards republicanism has now passed. There are no front pages now as terrifying as that time, and will not be until one of the young princes is caught doing something anti-social or illegal.</p> <p>The point is that Britain feels less and less like a monarchy. Such shifts are subjective and hard to define but, just as Scotland did seem to have a new atmosphere in the weeks after the opening of its new parliament, so England feels subtly different: in its newspapers and television stations and the conversations in its streets.</p> <p>The feeling is similar to the spell in an American presidency when he can no longer run for re-election but his successor is being lengthily selected. A lame-duck presidency, they say. The American electorate suffers that inconvenience for at most two years. British voters may put up with this one for a hundred or so, but the atmosphere of valedictory ceremonial is now the same: a lame-duck monarchy.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.newsunlimited.co.uk/theissues/\">The dispute explained</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.cjsims.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">CJ Sims Building Company</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.royal.gov.uk/family/edward.htm\" target=\"_new\">HRH The Earl of Wessex</a><br></p>",

And the specific charge against them - that they are arrogant and privileged and fail to live like ordinary people - is a fascinating back-flip. What, after all, would be the point of monarchy, except to have more money, less humility and a more rarefied existence than other people? What's interesting about this week's pieces is that they had the effect of reading about a film star who you'd thought for some time was dead. In a way which seems astonishing even in comparison with 20 years ago, it is possible to go about your business for weeks or even months now in Britain without noticing there's a throne or a family on it. The only articles which bring them into the papers are carping ones. The Queen's golden jubilee in the year 2002 may be used to try to increase their visibility, but the royals could find themselves celebrating age and continuity in a culture increasingly devoted to youth and change. There have been four factors in this eclipse. The first is that Tony Blair has co-opted many of the ceremonial roles once entrusted to the throne and particularly in the areas of openings, mournings and symbolic utterances. His unusual youth has even allowed him to be the first prime minister to challenge the royals in breeding babies for the media and nation to adore. The loss of Diana - the show's one star - has also been significant, though not in the way predicted. It seemed briefly that the celebration of her might provide a platform for hostility to the monarchy. In fact, the reaction has been more like apathy. Finding the stage looking bare, many of the audience have simply torn up their tickets and left. Devolution has also played a part, as its architects in Scotland and Wales always knew it would but Tony Blair felt obliged to deny. A shrinking kingdom diminishes the monarch. It could logically have no other effect. And finally there is the problem - which Diana's death exacerbates - of the age and relative dullness of the central characters. The great and governing agony of the Prince of Wales's life is at a lesser level the difficulty for all monarchists. They are almost certainly in a long period - which may last for up to another 20 years - of waiting for something to happen. This is a problem which afflicts all systems which depend on posthumous succession in an age of sophisticated medical care. None of this means that an actual republic is close. At a time when political skill is defined as caution, the question is not going to be asked. Even if it were, there are at least two living British generations who grew up with enough flag-waving and commemorative crockery to vote a loud No in any poll. Indeed, the moment in the mid-90s - with the divorces and the concession on tax and the refusal to use public funds to rebuild Windsor Castle - when there seemed to be a momentum towards republicanism has now passed. There are no front pages now as terrifying as that time, and will not be until one of the young princes is caught doing something anti-social or illegal. The point is that Britain feels less and less like a monarchy. Such shifts are subjective and hard to define but, just as Scotland did seem to have a new atmosphere in the weeks after the opening of its new parliament, so England feels subtly different: in its newspapers and television stations and the conversations in its streets. The feeling is similar to the spell in an American presidency when he can no longer run for re-election but his successor is being lengthily selected. A lame-duck presidency, they say. The American electorate suffers that inconvenience for at most two years. British voters may put up with this one for a hundred or so, but the atmosphere of valedictory ceremonial is now the same: a lame-duck monarchy.

Some commentators like to imagine that living in constant fear of arrest or death is a way of life that's hard to give up. I suppose that being on the run gives you an excuse for not doing much around the house, but most of us find in our 30s that we quite like staying in at night. I have not done extensive (any) research into this, nor would I presume, as the newsmen say, to \"enter the mindset of the IRA\", because it doesn't do to stare at people too intently in Belfast pubs, and apart from anything else, it's rude. But it seems to me that, if being an urban guerrilla were that much fun, there wouldn't be so many of them who are now doing other things.</p> <p>But despite the fact that this veteran had hung up his gun, he could have mentioned my suggestion to someone on the army council if he had thought that the musings of an English media tart might be put on the agenda at their next meeting.</p> <p>Today, the IRA is snowed under with exhortations to decommission some weapons. One wonders when one sees and hears these pronouncements exactly who is meant to be impressed by them. Fair enough, we are all paid to fill space, but should we British not remember that an amount of discord has resulted from our history of telling Irish people what to do?</p> <p>Of course, many people are calling for decommissioning, not just British commentators and politicians. People want peace. But peace and the peace process are not necessarily the same thing. The peace process, we hear, is in crisis. Not the peace, just the process. But this does not mean that a war process is beginning.</p> <p>The IRA leadership has held together and has prevented a significant split, partly because of internal discipline and partly because there has been no decommissioning. Would we all be cheering if there were a gesture of decommissioning this afternoon and, tomorrow, another Omagh?</p> <p>An alarming number of people say that there has to be a split sooner or later. Many of them would like this because it would mean IRA volunteers killing one another. It seems unlikely that there would be no ramifications for anyone else.</p> <p>Yes, these are worrying days, but at the moment the thing that is under threat is the agreement, not the peace. Very few republicans want war. Very many are unhappy with the agreement because it represents the best deal unionists could possibly have won. It's not a great read, but it does, remarkably, recognise the grandiose piece of ballot-rigging that is partition. In fact, our government has renounced our right to decolonise if we so wish, which makes a mockery of our history. What on earth's the point of over-running places if we then have to stay there when we're fed up with them?</p> <p>If unionists get the token gesture they demand, they will soon dismiss it as tokenism. If anything had been handed in at any stage it would have been said that it was no guarantee that the IRA are serious about peace. Now Peter Mandelson recognises that they are serious about peace but says they have to be serious about decommissioning. However did this ludicrous precondition come to dog the whole process? Oh yes, the British government has allowed it to - funny how we keep messing things up for Ireland.</p>",

I suppose that being on the run gives you an excuse for not doing much around the house, but most of us find in our 30s that we quite like staying in at night. I have not done extensive (any) research into this, nor would I presume, as the newsmen say, to \"enter the mindset of the IRA\", because it doesn't do to stare at people too intently in Belfast pubs, and apart from anything else, it's rude. But it seems to me that, if being an urban guerrilla were that much fun, there wouldn't be so many of them who are now doing other things. But despite the fact that this veteran had hung up his gun, he could have mentioned my suggestion to someone on the army council if he had thought that the musings of an English media tart might be put on the agenda at their next meeting. Today, the IRA is snowed under with exhortations to decommission some weapons. One wonders when one sees and hears these pronouncements exactly who is meant to be impressed by them. Fair enough, we are all paid to fill space, but should we British not remember that an amount of discord has resulted from our history of telling Irish people what to do? Of course, many people are calling for decommissioning, not just British commentators and politicians. People want peace. But peace and the peace process are not necessarily the same thing. The peace process, we hear, is in crisis. Not the peace, just the process. But this does not mean that a war process is beginning. The IRA leadership has held together and has prevented a significant split, partly because of internal discipline and partly because there has been no decommissioning. Would we all be cheering if there were a gesture of decommissioning this afternoon and, tomorrow, another Omagh? An alarming number of people say that there has to be a split sooner or later. Many of them would like this because it would mean IRA volunteers killing one another. It seems unlikely that there would be no ramifications for anyone else. Yes, these are worrying days, but at the moment the thing that is under threat is the agreement, not the peace. Very few republicans want war. Very many are unhappy with the agreement because it represents the best deal unionists could possibly have won. It's not a great read, but it does, remarkably, recognise the grandiose piece of ballot-rigging that is partition. In fact, our government has renounced our right to decolonise if we so wish, which makes a mockery of our history. What on earth's the point of over-running places if we then have to stay there when we're fed up with them? If unionists get the token gesture they demand, they will soon dismiss it as tokenism. If anything had been handed in at any stage it would have been said that it was no guarantee that the IRA are serious about peace. Now Peter Mandelson recognises that they are serious about peace but says they have to be serious about decommissioning. However did this ludicrous precondition come to dog the whole process? Oh yes, the British government has allowed it to - funny how we keep messing things up for Ireland.",

      "bodyText": "The trial of the Lockerbie bombing suspects is to be broadcast to victims' families in the UK and America via closed circuit TV. Pictures from the court, in the Netherlands, will be relayed to Dumfries, London, Washington and New York to allow families of those killed in the 1988 outrage to follow proceedings when they start in May. Plans for CCTV links were announced last year but required court approval, which has now been given by the trial judge, Lord Sutherland. A live TV feed has already been arranged for journalists in the court complex. The Scottish Executive said yesterday that the decision to allow families to see CCTV pictures of the trial was reached after a request by the US office for victims of crime (OVC), which is representing the needs of the relatives. But the decision has provoked a row with broadcasters, who have been barred from filming the trial. Some claim that the US government has effectively bought the TV rights to the trial. \"A substantial amount of money is being paid by the US to the British government, who are funding this trial,\" claimed one broadcast source yesterday. However, a spokeswoman for the OVC in Washington said: \"We are sharing some funds in order to set up the CCTV sites. It would be wrong to suggest we had bought the TV rights. Everything we do goes towards helping the victims' families.\" A spokesman for the Scottish Executive said the OVC was funding the CCTV sites, not the cameras in the court. He said there was no financial deal with the Scottish courts. A number of networks are interested in showing the trial. Next week, a group of leading broadcasters, led by the BBC, will attempt to get their cameras allowed into the court. Under 1925 legislation, cameras are prohibited from British courts, but guidelines drawn up in 1992 by Lord Hope, then head of the Scottish judiciary, permitted a procedure for allowing cameras into Scottish courts. The BBC's Scottish legal expert, Alistair Bonnington, said yesterday: \"If it is being filmed then we must be allowed to film as well.\" But a Scottish Executive spokesman said CCTV feeds, which enhanced the working of the court, and the televising of the trial were two completely different issues. Earlier this week, the two accused, Abdel-basset Ali Mohmed al-Megrahi and Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah, formally pleaded not guilty to the charges against them. The two men were handed over by Libya in April 1999. Lockerbie Trial Briefing Lockerbie Accident Investigation League of Arab States: Libya",

Wolfit's Lear was unarguably one of the greatest of the century. I suspect that Hoggart did not see it; I did and I have never seen its equal. Please read the reviews of his Lear and the astonishing reviews of his performances in Tamburlaine the Great and The Clandestine Marriage at the Old Vic - two other performances which I have never forgotten. Read James Agate on the young Wolfit at Stratford in the 1930s. Wolfit's defect was not that he could not act; it was that he was self-centred, arrogant, opinionated, selfish, and rode roughshod over others. I can see what Hoggart has in mind, but it has nothing to do with Wolfit's acting ability. Prof Les Allen Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk",

BT grabbed the headlines this week with the grim news that it is to slash 3,000 managerial jobs, M&amp;S is culling UK suppliers, threatening thousands of jobs losses, and British Airways is in a programme to cut 6,000 jobs.

Job advertising in the national broadsheet newspapers, after dipping at the start of 1999, rebounded in September, and is now climbing at a rate of 10-15% per month according to Media Monitoring Services.

Schools in West London are bussing in supply teachers daily from South Wales and hospitals are recruiting nurses from the Phillipines.</p> <p>Much of this is directly attributable to low pay - unqualified social care staff typically pick up around \u00a35 an hour, compared with \u00a36.25 an hour sitting at a Tesco's till. Even four-year qualified social workers start on not much more than \u00a317,000, while low-pay in nursing has landed the NHS in a near permanent recruitment crisis.</p> <p>Yet staff shortages are not just a feature of low-paid jobs.

Richard Watney of Elateral says that with unemployment in the Farnham area below 1%, it has had to cast its net wide for the 70 jobs it expects to create this year, and has just taken on a marketing manager from France. His only comfort is that it's even worse in the USA, where he has to pay software professionals 40-50% more than in the UK.</p> <p>The volume of jobs is allowing many applicants to pick and choose, says James Reed, chief executive of recruiters Reed Executive. \"If you've got the qualifications you can always be choosy, but particularly now,\" he says. In his experience if the job on offer is not attached to a prestigious brand such as Virgin or Sainsbury, it is unlikely to attract many candidates.</p> <p>It is not just corporates that are feeling the squeeze. The Armed Forces are suffering as highly-qualified personnel quit the service for highly-paid jobs elsewhere. Two weeks ago the Royal Air Force revealed that it is 20% short of its full complement of front-line fighter pilots.

These show there is a four out of five chance of equity money beating cash or government stocks over five years. With Isas there are no tax deductions, so what you see is what you get. The Edinburgh-based investment group calculates that the average 20th century investor would have turned \u00a35,000 into \u00a3200,000 in 18.7 years - often faster. The past is no promise of the future. But what the Standard Life findings show is that even buying at bad moments only increases the time needed to make a fortune by a few years.",

So if on January 31 you were owed a refund for 1998/99, you are safe from a penalty even if your return is late. And if you owed some tax, but less than \u00a3100, the penalty is reduced to that figure.

This quick guide should steer you through most of the problems.</p> <p><b> What is an Isa?</b></p> <p>It stands for individual savings account.</p> <p><b> What is special about it?</b></p> <p>Savers do not pay any tax on their dividends from shares or bonds or from their interest on savings accounts. It was created by the present government to encourage savings. And if they make gains on shares, there is no capital gains tax to pay, although losses on Isas cannot be offset against gains elsewhere.</p> <p><b> How much is the tax saving worth?</b></p> <p>Basic-rate taxpayers would receive \u00a380 for each \u00a3100 of interest in a taxed account and top-rate payers get \u00a360. In an Isa, they get the whole \u00a3100. These figures also apply to bond Isas.</p> <p>With shares, basic-rate taxpayers receive a special 10% tax credit and top-rate payers do even better.</p> <p><b> Can any individual have one?</b></p> <p>Yes - providing they are residents of the UK and aged 18 or over. Married couples can have an Isa each.</p> <p><b> How much can I invest?</b></p> <p>Up to \u00a37,000 in this tax year - to April 5 2000 - and up to \u00a35,000 in the nine subsequent tax years in which the government has promised that the scheme will run.</p> <p><b> Do I have to invest all my money in one go?</b></p> <p>Not necessarily. Most, though not all, product providers allow you to save monthly or to make payments when you can afford them. You cannot carry over unused Isa allowance from one tax year to the next.</p> <p><b> Where can I place my savings?</b></p> <p>There are literally thousands of variations of Isas. But there are three basic headings or \"components\":</p> <p>\u0095 stocks and shares</p> <p>\u0095 cash</p> <p>\u0095 insurance</p> <p><b> What are minis and maxis?</b></p> <p>A mini is where you can choose different product providers for different components. So you could buy one, two or three mini Isas. A maxi is where you buy one, two or three components from one product provider. You cannot hold a maxi Isa in the same tax year as a mini Isa.</p> <p><b> How much can I put into a maxi Isa?</b></p> <p>Every investor has an overall ceiling this year of \u00a37,000 -\u00a35,000 in subsequent years whether they go via the maxi or the mini route. You can invest up to your limit in a maxi Isa how you wish, providing that you do not exceed \u00a33,000 in the cash section (\u00a31,000 in subsequent years) and \u00a31,000 in the insurance component.</p> <p>Whatever is left over can then be invested in stocks and shares. If, for instance, you were to put \u00a3500 in cash and \u00a3600 in insurance, you could then invest up to \u00a35,900 in stocks and shares.</p> <p><b> What are the plus points of the maxi route?</b></p> <p>The maxi is for those who want to put the bulk of their annual allowance into equities or bonds - some Isa firms allow you to mix different types of stock and share investment.</p> <p>Many stock and share opportunities are only available with the maxi label. Discount brokers often give better deals to maxi investors who are prepared to put in the maximum amount.</p> <p><b> How much can I put into a mini Isa?</b></p> <p>You have the same overall \u00a37,000 limit (\u00a35,000 after this first year) but each component has its own ceiling as well. You can invest up to \u00a33,000 in stocks and shares, \u00a33,000 (\u00a31,000 after this year) in cash, and \u00a31,000 into insurance. But you cannot carry over an unused amount from one component to another. This could cut your overall tax free saving possibilities. Saving \u00a31 into a mini cash Isa puts you automatically on the mini-only route and limits your stocks and shares to \u00a33,000</p> <p><b> What are the advantages of the mini route?</b></p> <p>Choice is the main plus point. Most of the cash Isa providers only offer a mini version.</p> <p><b> How long do I have to keep my money in for?</b></p> <p>There is no minimum period, although the insurance Isa works best when kept for at least three years and equity Isas could fall in price.</p> <p>If you are dissatisfied with the Isa provider, you can switch to another within the same component category. If you make a withdrawal, you cannot replace the money later, so Isas are better suited to long-term saving than for those who need ready access.</p>",

Up to \u00a37,000 in this tax year - to April 5 2000 - and up to \u00a35,000 in the nine subsequent tax years in which the government has promised that the scheme will run. Do I have to invest all my money in one go? Not necessarily. Most, though not all, product providers allow you to save monthly or to make payments when you can afford them. You cannot carry over unused Isa allowance from one tax year to the next. Where can I place my savings? There are literally thousands of variations of Isas. But there are three basic headings or \"components\": \u0095 stocks and shares \u0095 cash \u0095 insurance What are minis and maxis? A mini is where you can choose different product providers for different components. So you could buy one, two or three mini Isas. A maxi is where you buy one, two or three components from one product provider. You cannot hold a maxi Isa in the same tax year as a mini Isa. How much can I put into a maxi Isa? Every investor has an overall ceiling this year of \u00a37,000 -\u00a35,000 in subsequent years whether they go via the maxi or the mini route. You can invest up to your limit in a maxi Isa how you wish, providing that you do not exceed \u00a33,000 in the cash section (\u00a31,000 in subsequent years) and \u00a31,000 in the insurance component. Whatever is left over can then be invested in stocks and shares. If, for instance, you were to put \u00a3500 in cash and \u00a3600 in insurance, you could then invest up to \u00a35,900 in stocks and shares. What are the plus points of the maxi route? The maxi is for those who want to put the bulk of their annual allowance into equities or bonds - some Isa firms allow you to mix different types of stock and share investment. Many stock and share opportunities are only available with the maxi label. Discount brokers often give better deals to maxi investors who are prepared to put in the maximum amount. How much can I put into a mini Isa? You have the same overall \u00a37,000 limit (\u00a35,000 after this first year) but each component has its own ceiling as well. You can invest up to \u00a33,000 in stocks and shares, \u00a33,000 (\u00a31,000 after this year) in cash, and \u00a31,000 into insurance. But you cannot carry over an unused amount from one component to another. This could cut your overall tax free saving possibilities. Saving \u00a31 into a mini cash Isa puts you automatically on the mini-only route and limits your stocks and shares to \u00a33,000 What are the advantages of the mini route? Choice is the main plus point. Most of the cash Isa providers only offer a mini version. How long do I have to keep my money in for? There is no minimum period, although the insurance Isa works best when kept for at least three years and equity Isas could fall in price. If you are dissatisfied with the Isa provider, you can switch to another within the same component category. If you make a withdrawal, you cannot replace the money later, so Isas are better suited to long-term saving than for those who need ready access.",

      "body": "<p>On July 20, 1969, the collective imagination of the planet was captured by the grainy black-and-white images of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walking on the moon. On a family holiday in Bettystown, County Louth, my childish thoughts were focused not on the two indistinct figures beamed back from the planet's surface, but on the other guy; the one left behind in the spaceship circling above them, waiting in limbo for what must have seemed like an eternity for the safe return of his comrades. </p> <p>Michael Collins, the astronaut in question, occupied a special place in my adolescent imagination because he had the same name as the charismatic Irish civil-war hero, later immortalised on celluloid in Neil Jordan's film. The other Michael Collins, though, missed out on the great symbolic moment, yet his role in the unfolding drama seemed to me the most heroic, certainly the most lonely, of all. \"Collins moved through a continual succession of sun-drenched lunar day, soft earthlight, and unyielding blackness,\" writes Andrew Chaikin, in his extraordinarily detailed and evocative book about the Apollo missions, Man On The Moon. \"For 48 minutes out of each orbit, from Loss of Signal to Acquisition of Signal, he knew a solitude unprecedented in human history.\" </p> <p>Collins was alone in the Columbia spacecraft for 22 hours. In the event, he did not even get to hear the most famous words uttered in the 20th century. As Neil Armstrong stepped on to the lunar surface - \"That's one small step for man...\" then, that Shakespearian pause, \"...one giant leap for mankind\" - the Columbia had just slipped behind the far side of the moon and he had lost the moon-earth-moon link-up engineered by mission control for his benefit. By the time he reappeared, Armstrong and Aldrin were planting the American flag on the Sea of Tranquillity, but a technical fault kept him cut off. While an estimated 600 million people on planet earth watched and listened, transfixed, the man closest to those momentous events could, literally and symbolically, only imagine them. </p> <p>Reading Chaikin's book brought home to me the full responsibility and risk of the Apollo adventures: Apollo 1 caught fire and its crew - Grissom, White and Chaffee - had perished barely two years before the successful moon landing. It was a tragedy that had been all but expunged from America's collective memory, but one that must have haunted the astronauts who followed in their footsteps. If disaster had struck Apollo 11 - say, if the Eagle, the landing craft, had malfunctioned during its take-off from the moon, or if it had later failed to dock with the Columbia craft - Collins would have had to do the unthinkable: leave his partners behind and journey back to earth alone. For the rest of his life, he would have had to carry an impossibly heavy burden: the loss of his friends and fellow adventurers, and the death of the greatest of all American dreams. It would have been a disaster with implications we can barely imagine. </p> <p>Did he allow the unthinkable to cross his mind as he floated silently in space some 60 miles above the surface of the moon? Apparently not. Soon after the event, Collins published his diary of that time in limbo, fragments of which read like a work of almost metaphysical intensity, yet contain no traces of uncertainty regarding the precariousness of his mission: \"I am alone, now, truly alone, and absolutely isolated from any known life,\" he wrote. \"I am it. If a count were taken, the score would be three billion plus two over on the other side of the moon, and one plus God knows what on this side. I feel this powerfully - not as fear or loneliness - but as awareness, anticipation, satisfaction, confidence, almost exultation. I like.\" </p> <p>That, in essence, was what Tom Wolfe would later call the Right Stuff: self-belief, certitude and - \"I am it\" - pure ego. </p> <p>The photographer Steve Pyke grew up, like me, transfixed by America's great adventure in space. As the years passed and appreciation of that great adventure seemed to diminish in the collective consciousness, his curiosity about it - and the men who undertook it - grew. \"It has,\" he says, \"taken me 30 years to absorb what they did and to make sense of it, not just as a scientific achievement but as the last truly heroic human adventure. It was a singular moment when a few individuals carried the whole world's hopes and aspirations. I just wanted to meet these guys, as much as anything, because they were myth- makers, adventurers, pioneers. I think you can feel that off them, their sense of destiny, the sense that they were, and remain, part of an elect. It's a palpable energy - an aura, almost. They come into a room and the atmosphere changes. But there's also something else, something more elusive and almost sad. What they achieved was truly awe-inspiring, and, in a way, they have had to live in the shadow of that moment ever since. That's a heavy weight to carry.\" </p> <p>Pyke never got to meet Collins, who declined to be photographed for personal reasons - he had just lost his son - nor Armstrong, who now fiercely protects his privacy and has retreated to a remote home in native rural Ohio, but he did photograph and talk to the other Apollo 11 astronaut, Aldrin, as well as 10 other men who had been in outer space. He asked each of them what space meant to them and, unsurprisingly, garnered some interesting answers. </p> <p>\"I was ordered to Washington DC in 1959 to listen to overtures about going into space in a capsule on top of a rocket,\" replied Wally Schirra, whose career spanned both the Gemini and Apollo missions. \"I was not interested, and I lost interest completely when it was added that they would launch monkeys and chimpanzees first. Later, I realised that, as a fighter pilot, if I wanted to go higher, faster and farther, this was the way. I left earth three times and found no other place to go. Please take care of Spaceship Earth.\" </p> <p>To Pyke's surprise, he found that many of the space pioneers had, like Yuri Gagarin before them, been treated shabbily by the government that was, simultaneously, holding them up as the ultimate exemplars of the American dream. \"Armstrong was sent out on extraordinary meet-and-greet itineraries, doing maybe 15 interviews a day as well as speeches, but nobody really looked after him. He was booked into scuzzy hotels, often he didn't have time to eat all day.\" </p> <p>If Armstrong took his destiny in hand and retreated voluntarily from the glare of celebrity, Buzz Aldrin had an altogether more difficult time: he struggled with both manic depression and alcoholism before finding a new role as, according to Chaikin, \"a one-man think tank, designing everything from new launch vehicles to scenarios for returning to the moon\". Charlie Duke, the tenth man to walk on the moon, went the other way and set up his own church in Texas. In all there have been six successful missions to the moon, and 12 men have walked on it. </p> <p>\"They all have extraordinary egos,\" says Pyke, \"but that goes with the turf, I guess. Whatever, to me they are heroic men in the real sense of the word. They took extraordinary risks and what they did was, literally and metaphorically, out of this world. I've photographed enough celebrities to see first-hand how devalued and diminished the notion of heroism has become, but these guys were the real thing and they made me feel like a star-struck kid.\" </p> <p>Pyke also photographed the Nasa back-up teams and, in the process, uncovered a plethora of old technical instruments - some were gathering dust in cupboards, but all have acquired an almost talismanic quality not because of their often extraordinary functions but because of where they have been. There is the Apollo 11 sample box, for transporting moon rock, the hammer that astronaut Al Bean used to chip those samples from lunar craters and ridges, and a strange, vice-like tool that turned out to be Tom Stafford's water dispenser. </p> <p>Pyke also discovered that each astronaut was allowed to take into space a PPK - Personal Preference Kit - in which he could carry objects of his choice up to a certain weight. \"Many of them brought cheap rings and medals, rolls of dimes, books of stamps, things they could give away to their friends and family when they returned: small things invested with huge meaning because they'd been to the moon and back.\" </p> <p>Rusty Schweickart, known to his compatriots as \"the hippy astronaut\" because he preferred to listen to the Grateful Dead in space rather than the regulation country-and-western recordings, brought a collection of quotations by John and Robert Kennedy, the Dalai Lama, Walt Whitman and Elizabeth Barrett Browning. He secretly attached them to the inside of his spacesuit, and they were there with him when he walked out of Apollo 9 into space. </p> <p>Schweickart also experienced something that no other astronaut, before or since, has: because of a technical hitch that occurred just as he stepped outside the craft, he had to wait for five minutes while it was corrected. Instead of working at his tasks quickly and intensely, as he had been trained to, he suddenly had breathing space, time to try and take in where he was, what he was doing. He held on to the rail of Apollo 9 and - for five long minutes - glided through the vastness and silence of space. Below him he could see America drift by, and even, after a while, make out southern California, where he lived. It was a life-changing moment, and, like the rest of them, Schweickart has, to some degree, lived in the shadow of that moment ever since. </p> <p>In a whole other way, so have we. What strikes me, in retrospect, about the great lunar adventure is how quickly we - the human race - processed it and, more troublingly, lost interest in it. \"The whole Apollo mission was born of a time of great idealism and optimism,\" says Pyke, \"even though it was located within the political drama of the cold war. The country had a charismatic president, John F Kennedy, who voiced the dream, and also used it to bolster his own self image. But they went ahead and did it. That's the essential thing which maybe we have lost. By the time it came to pass, that reservoir of idealism had been used up, by the war in Vietnam, by the turmoil at home. By the time of Apollo 13, there were no more live broadcasts, unless there was trouble or impending tragedy. People were saying, 'We've been to the moon - so what?'

      "bodyText": "On July 20, 1969, the collective imagination of the planet was captured by the grainy black-and-white images of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walking on the moon. On a family holiday in Bettystown, County Louth, my childish thoughts were focused not on the two indistinct figures beamed back from the planet's surface, but on the other guy; the one left behind in the spaceship circling above them, waiting in limbo for what must have seemed like an eternity for the safe return of his comrades. Michael Collins, the astronaut in question, occupied a special place in my adolescent imagination because he had the same name as the charismatic Irish civil-war hero, later immortalised on celluloid in Neil Jordan's film. The other Michael Collins, though, missed out on the great symbolic moment, yet his role in the unfolding drama seemed to me the most heroic, certainly the most lonely, of all. \"Collins moved through a continual succession of sun-drenched lunar day, soft earthlight, and unyielding blackness,\" writes Andrew Chaikin, in his extraordinarily detailed and evocative book about the Apollo missions, Man On The Moon. \"For 48 minutes out of each orbit, from Loss of Signal to Acquisition of Signal, he knew a solitude unprecedented in human history.\" Collins was alone in the Columbia spacecraft for 22 hours. In the event, he did not even get to hear the most famous words uttered in the 20th century. As Neil Armstrong stepped on to the lunar surface - \"That's one small step for man...\" then, that Shakespearian pause, \"...one giant leap for mankind\" - the Columbia had just slipped behind the far side of the moon and he had lost the moon-earth-moon link-up engineered by mission control for his benefit. By the time he reappeared, Armstrong and Aldrin were planting the American flag on the Sea of Tranquillity, but a technical fault kept him cut off. While an estimated 600 million people on planet earth watched and listened, transfixed, the man closest to those momentous events could, literally and symbolically, only imagine them. Reading Chaikin's book brought home to me the full responsibility and risk of the Apollo adventures: Apollo 1 caught fire and its crew - Grissom, White and Chaffee - had perished barely two years before the successful moon landing. It was a tragedy that had been all but expunged from America's collective memory, but one that must have haunted the astronauts who followed in their footsteps. If disaster had struck Apollo 11 - say, if the Eagle, the landing craft, had malfunctioned during its take-off from the moon, or if it had later failed to dock with the Columbia craft - Collins would have had to do the unthinkable: leave his partners behind and journey back to earth alone. For the rest of his life, he would have had to carry an impossibly heavy burden: the loss of his friends and fellow adventurers, and the death of the greatest of all American dreams. It would have been a disaster with implications we can barely imagine. Did he allow the unthinkable to cross his mind as he floated silently in space some 60 miles above the surface of the moon? Apparently not. Soon after the event, Collins published his diary of that time in limbo, fragments of which read like a work of almost metaphysical intensity, yet contain no traces of uncertainty regarding the precariousness of his mission: \"I am alone, now, truly alone, and absolutely isolated from any known life,\" he wrote. \"I am it. If a count were taken, the score would be three billion plus two over on the other side of the moon, and one plus God knows what on this side. I feel this powerfully - not as fear or loneliness - but as awareness, anticipation, satisfaction, confidence, almost exultation. I like.\" That, in essence, was what Tom Wolfe would later call the Right Stuff: self-belief, certitude and - \"I am it\" - pure ego. The photographer Steve Pyke grew up, like me, transfixed by America's great adventure in space. As the years passed and appreciation of that great adventure seemed to diminish in the collective consciousness, his curiosity about it - and the men who undertook it - grew. \"It has,\" he says, \"taken me 30 years to absorb what they did and to make sense of it, not just as a scientific achievement but as the last truly heroic human adventure. It was a singular moment when a few individuals carried the whole world's hopes and aspirations. I just wanted to meet these guys, as much as anything, because they were myth- makers, adventurers, pioneers. I think you can feel that off them, their sense of destiny, the sense that they were, and remain, part of an elect. It's a palpable energy - an aura, almost. They come into a room and the atmosphere changes. But there's also something else, something more elusive and almost sad. What they achieved was truly awe-inspiring, and, in a way, they have had to live in the shadow of that moment ever since. That's a heavy weight to carry.\" Pyke never got to meet Collins, who declined to be photographed for personal reasons - he had just lost his son - nor Armstrong, who now fiercely protects his privacy and has retreated to a remote home in native rural Ohio, but he did photograph and talk to the other Apollo 11 astronaut, Aldrin, as well as 10 other men who had been in outer space. He asked each of them what space meant to them and, unsurprisingly, garnered some interesting answers. \"I was ordered to Washington DC in 1959 to listen to overtures about going into space in a capsule on top of a rocket,\" replied Wally Schirra, whose career spanned both the Gemini and Apollo missions. \"I was not interested, and I lost interest completely when it was added that they would launch monkeys and chimpanzees first. Later, I realised that, as a fighter pilot, if I wanted to go higher, faster and farther, this was the way. I left earth three times and found no other place to go. Please take care of Spaceship Earth.\" To Pyke's surprise, he found that many of the space pioneers had, like Yuri Gagarin before them, been treated shabbily by the government that was, simultaneously, holding them up as the ultimate exemplars of the American dream. \"Armstrong was sent out on extraordinary meet-and-greet itineraries, doing maybe 15 interviews a day as well as speeches, but nobody really looked after him. He was booked into scuzzy hotels, often he didn't have time to eat all day.\" If Armstrong took his destiny in hand and retreated voluntarily from the glare of celebrity, Buzz Aldrin had an altogether more difficult time: he struggled with both manic depression and alcoholism before finding a new role as, according to Chaikin, \"a one-man think tank, designing everything from new launch vehicles to scenarios for returning to the moon\". Charlie Duke, the tenth man to walk on the moon, went the other way and set up his own church in Texas. In all there have been six successful missions to the moon, and 12 men have walked on it. \"They all have extraordinary egos,\" says Pyke, \"but that goes with the turf, I guess. Whatever, to me they are heroic men in the real sense of the word. They took extraordinary risks and what they did was, literally and metaphorically, out of this world. I've photographed enough celebrities to see first-hand how devalued and diminished the notion of heroism has become, but these guys were the real thing and they made me feel like a star-struck kid.\" Pyke also photographed the Nasa back-up teams and, in the process, uncovered a plethora of old technical instruments - some were gathering dust in cupboards, but all have acquired an almost talismanic quality not because of their often extraordinary functions but because of where they have been. There is the Apollo 11 sample box, for transporting moon rock, the hammer that astronaut Al Bean used to chip those samples from lunar craters and ridges, and a strange, vice-like tool that turned out to be Tom Stafford's water dispenser. Pyke also discovered that each astronaut was allowed to take into space a PPK - Personal Preference Kit - in which he could carry objects of his choice up to a certain weight. \"Many of them brought cheap rings and medals, rolls of dimes, books of stamps, things they could give away to their friends and family when they returned: small things invested with huge meaning because they'd been to the moon and back.\" Rusty Schweickart, known to his compatriots as \"the hippy astronaut\" because he preferred to listen to the Grateful Dead in space rather than the regulation country-and-western recordings, brought a collection of quotations by John and Robert Kennedy, the Dalai Lama, Walt Whitman and Elizabeth Barrett Browning. He secretly attached them to the inside of his spacesuit, and they were there with him when he walked out of Apollo 9 into space. Schweickart also experienced something that no other astronaut, before or since, has: because of a technical hitch that occurred just as he stepped outside the craft, he had to wait for five minutes while it was corrected. Instead of working at his tasks quickly and intensely, as he had been trained to, he suddenly had breathing space, time to try and take in where he was, what he was doing. He held on to the rail of Apollo 9 and - for five long minutes - glided through the vastness and silence of space. Below him he could see America drift by, and even, after a while, make out southern California, where he lived. It was a life-changing moment, and, like the rest of them, Schweickart has, to some degree, lived in the shadow of that moment ever since. In a whole other way, so have we. What strikes me, in retrospect, about the great lunar adventure is how quickly we - the human race - processed it and, more troublingly, lost interest in it. \"The whole Apollo mission was born of a time of great idealism and optimism,\" says Pyke, \"even though it was located within the political drama of the cold war. The country had a charismatic president, John F Kennedy, who voiced the dream, and also used it to bolster his own self image. But they went ahead and did it. That's the essential thing which maybe we have lost. By the time it came to pass, that reservoir of idealism had been used up, by the war in Vietnam, by the turmoil at home. By the time of Apollo 13, there were no more live broadcasts, unless there was trouble or impending tragedy. People were saying, 'We've been to the moon - so what?' The stuff that was happening on earth had diminished our sense of wonder to that degree.\" Now, with the 20th century over, perhaps we can look back and sense how much history was being made back in the 60s, that most criticised decade. Some people still maintain that the Apollo adventure was simply a collective American ego trip in the context of the cold war; that it was an empty gesture, which, ultimately, did not benefit mankind in any real way. But for me and, I suspect, Steve Pyke, not to mention nearly everyone else who came of age at the time, that black-and-white view is both reductive and cynical when set against the lingering sense of wonder that neither time nor experience has diminished. The last word goes to Frank Borman, who journeyed into space on Apollo 8: \"My experience on Apollo 8 helped me to see how isolated and fragile our earth really is. It was also beautiful. It was the only object in the entire universe that was neither black nor white.\"",

I like the food - tremendously so. I like the unrepentantly all-Greek wine list. I like the service. I like the open-plan kitchen, the well-worn wooden floor, the comfort of the chairs, the cream-and-brown paintwork, and the frame to the big picture window looking out on to the calm of Hoxton Market. I like the way it balances between novelty chic and old-fashioned comfort. I like its prices. I even quite like Hoxton.</p> <p>I think that just about wraps things up, so you might want to ring up now and book right away, or pass on to something else. Oh, all right then: a word of explanation might be in order.</p> <p>Hoxton is one of those coming bits of London with which taxi drivers have a lot of trouble. Either they don't want to go there or, once they get you there, they are inclined to drop you off at one Hoxton Market, when you really want to go to the other Hoxton Market. Hoxton is unique, I think, in the British Isles, in having two markets, only one of which is really a market in the sense of selling things, but both of which appear to exist only to confuse taxi drivers and to confound the unwary. That was certainly the impression that Celimene got when she tried to make her way to The Real Greek. She was reduced to being talked in on her mobile from the Holiday Inn around the corner (down the road from Old Street underground station, for those of us more used to public transport).</p> <p>The moving spirit behind The Real Greek is Theodore Kyriakou, who has a bit of form behind him. He first came to general notice when he opened the splendid Livebait in Waterloo, which built up a formidable reputation for rather outr\u00e9 treatments of fish, before selling on to the Chez Gerard group (since when the standards have rather slipped). Theodore is Greek in antecedents. No surprise there. Hitherto, Greek cooking has not been terribly well served by most of its practitioners here. No, hitherto Greece figured just above Malta and Baffin Island at the bottom of my own personal league table of culinary cultures.</p> <p>No longer. Kyriakou has dipped into the treasure chest of Greek regional and domestic cooking, subjected his discoveries to the transforming power of his eye and technical skill, and come up with a sequence of aces. The menu is divided into four parts. Mezedes, which are not unlike the mezze of North Africa, being a series of nibbles, here grouped in combinations of three or four elements: tuna cured with eastern spices, lady's thighs meatballs, and bean stew cooked in the oven is one example; kalamata olives, pur\u00e9e of yellow split peas from Santorini, salami from Lefkes and mature feta cheese is another. You can take a selection of these, if you fancy, or just one grouping as a first course.</p> <p>Then there are small dishes - real first courses, if you like: Cretan-style octopus stifado with kritharaki-rice pasta and grated kefalotiri, or spinach and feta pie from Epirus. Then the main courses: roast neck of lamb, smoked pork and spicy beef sausages with a bean casserole or roast fillet of fish Spetsai-style with a warm salad of cauliflower and broccoli with ricotta dressing. And for pudding, how about rose-petal meringue roulade filled with blackberry-scented manouri to mop up whatever hunger you have left?</p> <p>I had, in fact, ordered by the time Celimene poled up and, out of a desire to keep things simple, I think, she ordered exactly the same as I had - that is, a mixed mezede of barbecued squid with olive oil and lemon juice, and home-salted fillet of cod with mashed-potato-and-garlic a\u00efoli and roast beetroot, followed by beef shin cooked in its own consomm\u00e9, with vegetables and potatoes in a mustard mayonnaise, olive oil and lemon juice dressing - striking out on her own only when it came to the pudding, which we will come to all in good time.</p> <p>The mixed mezede was a delight. The squid had that delicious hint of caramel and taut tenderness that comes only when you hit very fresh fish with exactly the right degree of fierce heat. The fat finger of salted cod was encased in a crisp, light batter, a kind of Greek tempura. The potato-laden a\u00efoli was heady with lemon juice, while a slab of golden beetroot and two smaller slices of the ordinary red variety added a note of earthy sweetness. This food wasn't the higher reaches of invention. It wasn't pushing back the boundaries of taste, or even laying down a challenge to the eater. It was just beautifully judged and a joy to eat.</p> <p>The same could be said of the shin of beef arrangement. The consomm\u00e9 was as clear and cleanly flavoured as the most exacting old-school chef could wish for, and generous hunks of beef shin floated in it, along with the veg. Beef shin is one of the cheaper cuts but, when braised long and slow, it takes on a gentle fibrous softness, a luscious floppiness, that I find quite irresistible.

But there's more to oxtail than muscle. There are the vertebrae, cushioned on both ends by a pad of collagen, about which more in a mo'. The details Since tails taper, pieces of oxtail range in size from thumb-like to fist-like. The biggest piece, where tail meets sacrum, is scrappy and irregular. Some tails are fat-free, others need a serious trim. Normally, you'll be sold a whole tail, or a selection of pieces in different sizes. No matter. They're all good. And the cooking's as easy as falling off a log - but a lot more rewarding. Brown in hot oil. Put in a heavy pot with plenty of fluid and whatever flavourings take your fancy. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat to a simmer (low oven by choice) and go to sleep. After a long time, the braised meat is tender and the collagen is lip-gluing gelatin. Yum. Oxtail is almost impossible to overcook, and likes being reheated and frozen. It also likes garlic, wine (any colour), bacon, tinned tomatoes, any dried herb, onions, citrus peel, Chinese things. Reserve plate-space for: something starchy to soak up the braising liquid. Reserve contempt for: recipes that want the oxtail boned. OTT recipe: Paul Heathcote's Char-Grilled Cutlet of Beef with Braised Oxtail Casserole, Horseradish Potatoes, Mustard Cream and Ale Sauce (see his Rhubarb And Black Pudding, Fourth Estate). Sensible recipe: Marcella Hazan's Oxtail alla Vaccinara (see her The Essentials of Italian Cooking, Macmillan). The easy way out You've already got it. Where to buy The butcher's your best bet - most supermarkets don't bother. Expect to pay \u00a31-2 a pound.",

      "body": "<p>The floral trials that take place at Wisley are of a selection of commonly-grown plants for which exciting developments are foreseen. I consider myself lucky to be on the committee that judges them through the seasons, but they are there for any visitor to examine. However, judging makes you really look, assess and criticise - and the more you look, the more you see.</p> <p>The trial of violas from seed a year ago was a real eye-opener; they had such an amazingly long season. From a July sowing, the plants started flowering in October and continued through to early summer. They made a terrific show, far greater than pansies would have done.</p> <p>Violas are generally smaller-flowered than pansies, but exceedingly prolific. Large-flowered pansies, for example, have problems with holding their petals in place: they are inclined, one or more of them, to fold forward under their own weight, which spoils the flower's symmetry. Pansies often have \"faces\" (violas generally not), which can be an attractive feature at close range, as in a window box, but from a distance create a confused overall impression.</p> <p>Of the violas in the trial, the Jewel series, bred in Japan, was the most impressive. 'Jewel Blue', 'Jewel Deep Blue' and 'Jewel Yellow' all won Awards of Merit. If you find these (or any other) hard to locate as seed or as plants, contact the RHS at Wisley for a source.</p> <p>Bellis, the highly developed versions of our common daisy, B. perennis, was the other over- wintering outside trial. Sown in July or thereabouts, these were flowering from January on, but were, overall, a disappointment, being susceptible to rust disease, a newly-arrived affliction, and despite regular sprayings. Potentially, they make a fine carpet beneath tulips, however, and if you want to have a go, the two Award of Garden Merit winners were 'Romi Red' and 'Roggli Red'. I shall give them a miss for a while.</p> <p>In the summer, there was a huge, brain-numbing trial of grandiflora petunias. The two main categories of petunia from seed are grandiflora and multiflora - the grandifloras are favourites in the US, having larger flowers and a more compact habit; and they are favoured by the hotter US summers, but are less weather-resistant in our climate. Physically, you can distinguish them from multifloras as their green calyx (behind the showy corolla) has short, narrow sepals, whereas the multifloras are broader and rounder. A number of entries in the trial were disqualified for being multifloras.</p> <p>But on the whole, I find them preferable, as their less compact, more rangy habit better suits the looser, shirt-sleeves style of gardening that I enjoy, and they produce plenty of colour. Also, they do not react so direly to hail or heavy rain. If rain or hail occurs in late June or early July, while the petunias are young though already in flower, they can stage a better recovery than if the elements turn against them in August, as they (inevitably) did last year. The trial of grandifloras never made more than a partial recovery.</p> <p>Among the most weather- resistant (and you can breed for this) was the Storm series: 'Storm Lavender', 'Storm Pink', 'Storm White' and so on. It was noticeable that white-flowered strains are the most susceptible to blemishes caused by weather. The whole trial - and this is a point often forgotten about petunias in general - was deliciously scented on the air, even by day, though it is even stronger at night and in the early morning.</p> <p>A veil must be quickly drawn over the cosmos trial, for which the soil was far too rich, so that the plants grew huge and leafy but never made a proper display. It also emphasised that the sulphurous types - those with orange or deep-yellow flowers - are the first to go mouldy and never recover if the weather turns against them. I discovered, years ago, that they are useless on my heavy clay soil, which is a shame, because their colour intensity can be a wonderful feature. I would still recommend them to any gardener with a hot, sandy soil and full exposure to sun.</p> <p>The trial of zonal pelargoniums - those popularly known as 'geraniums' - took place with the same varieties grown both as pot plants under glass and as bedding plants outside. They were all single-flowered types, with no more than five petals to a flower.</p> <p>Single-flowered 'geraniums' do not make quite the intense display of which doubles are capable, but neither do they succumb to wet weather so badly. Even so, they greatly benefit from the small attention that a gardener can readily give them, of rubbing out and removing the clusters of dead blooms that accumulate at the centre of each flower truss, long before the entire truss has finished flowering. We are always tidying up, particularly those grown in ornamental pots, tubs and window boxes, but it is not an unacceptable chore.</p> <p>I love the combination of magenta and carmine, or magenta and red, that you often find in a 'geranium' flower, as in 'Cardinalis', but my heart was really captured by 'Antik Violett Tikvio', a tall-growing magenta-and-violet variety. I liked its extra height. One wearies of everything being made compact. However, my fellow committee members were not too keen, so you might not be, either.</p> <p>Be sure to visit the trial of heuchera in early summer. It was already most interesting in 1999.</p> <p><b>Spadework</b><br>Celia Woolfrey</p> <p><b>Tom Tom Club</b> <br> My tomato crop was pants last year, so this year Organic Tomatoes: The Inside Story (Harris Associates, \u00a315.99), by Terry Marshall, will be obligatory reading. Marshall's tomato plants produce fruit from May through to November, and the green fruit that ripens in the house lasts him until the following February (and no, he doesn't live in the Canary Islands, but in West Yorkshire). An intriguing part of his technique includes 'reading the leaves', so plants get the right feed and growing conditions as and when they need them. The book is available through the Organic Gardening Catalogue (01932 253666, or email <a href=\"mailto:chaseorg@aol.com\">chaseorg@aol.com</a>).</p> <p><b>Time to ...</b> <br> Give birds a water supply and check that fish don't get frozen into ponds. A nifty method for the latter is to put a plastic ball on the surface, as the ball floats around in the least breeze and its movement stops the water freezing. What should be avoided is smashing the ice with a hammer: the sound waves reverberate through the water and can be enough of a shock to kill the fish.</p> <p><b>Plant of the week</b> <br> The name Asian buttercup doesn't convey the plushness of Ranunculus asiaticus . This is probably because it has been substantially bred from its weedy, wildflower origins - modern cultivars such as 'Accolade' have something pleasingly kitsch about them. The only drawback is that R. asiaticus isn't hardy: it will grow well enough outdoors in warm areas, but if in doubt, grow in pots and bring inside in winter, or grow under glass for cut flowers. Plant between now and spring. Weekend readers can buy a ranunculus collection for \u00a315.99, inc UK p&amp;p: the collection consists of five x 15 asiaticus bulbs, comprising 15 yellow, 15 white, 15 red, 15 pink and 15 orange.

Of the violas in the trial, the Jewel series, bred in Japan, was the most impressive. 'Jewel Blue', 'Jewel Deep Blue' and 'Jewel Yellow' all won Awards of Merit. If you find these (or any other) hard to locate as seed or as plants, contact the RHS at Wisley for a source. Bellis, the highly developed versions of our common daisy, B. perennis, was the other over- wintering outside trial. Sown in July or thereabouts, these were flowering from January on, but were, overall, a disappointment, being susceptible to rust disease, a newly-arrived affliction, and despite regular sprayings. Potentially, they make a fine carpet beneath tulips, however, and if you want to have a go, the two Award of Garden Merit winners were 'Romi Red' and 'Roggli Red'. I shall give them a miss for a while. In the summer, there was a huge, brain-numbing trial of grandiflora petunias. The two main categories of petunia from seed are grandiflora and multiflora - the grandifloras are favourites in the US, having larger flowers and a more compact habit; and they are favoured by the hotter US summers, but are less weather-resistant in our climate. Physically, you can distinguish them from multifloras as their green calyx (behind the showy corolla) has short, narrow sepals, whereas the multifloras are broader and rounder. A number of entries in the trial were disqualified for being multifloras. But on the whole, I find them preferable, as their less compact, more rangy habit better suits the looser, shirt-sleeves style of gardening that I enjoy, and they produce plenty of colour. Also, they do not react so direly to hail or heavy rain. If rain or hail occurs in late June or early July, while the petunias are young though already in flower, they can stage a better recovery than if the elements turn against them in August, as they (inevitably) did last year. The trial of grandifloras never made more than a partial recovery. Among the most weather- resistant (and you can breed for this) was the Storm series: 'Storm Lavender', 'Storm Pink', 'Storm White' and so on. It was noticeable that white-flowered strains are the most susceptible to blemishes caused by weather. The whole trial - and this is a point often forgotten about petunias in general - was deliciously scented on the air, even by day, though it is even stronger at night and in the early morning. A veil must be quickly drawn over the cosmos trial, for which the soil was far too rich, so that the plants grew huge and leafy but never made a proper display. It also emphasised that the sulphurous types - those with orange or deep-yellow flowers - are the first to go mouldy and never recover if the weather turns against them. I discovered, years ago, that they are useless on my heavy clay soil, which is a shame, because their colour intensity can be a wonderful feature. I would still recommend them to any gardener with a hot, sandy soil and full exposure to sun. The trial of zonal pelargoniums - those popularly known as 'geraniums' - took place with the same varieties grown both as pot plants under glass and as bedding plants outside. They were all single-flowered types, with no more than five petals to a flower. Single-flowered 'geraniums' do not make quite the intense display of which doubles are capable, but neither do they succumb to wet weather so badly. Even so, they greatly benefit from the small attention that a gardener can readily give them, of rubbing out and removing the clusters of dead blooms that accumulate at the centre of each flower truss, long before the entire truss has finished flowering. We are always tidying up, particularly those grown in ornamental pots, tubs and window boxes, but it is not an unacceptable chore. I love the combination of magenta and carmine, or magenta and red, that you often find in a 'geranium' flower, as in 'Cardinalis', but my heart was really captured by 'Antik Violett Tikvio', a tall-growing magenta-and-violet variety. I liked its extra height. One wearies of everything being made compact. However, my fellow committee members were not too keen, so you might not be, either. Be sure to visit the trial of heuchera in early summer. It was already most interesting in 1999. Spadework Celia Woolfrey Tom Tom Club My tomato crop was pants last year, so this year Organic Tomatoes: The Inside Story (Harris Associates, \u00a315.99), by Terry Marshall, will be obligatory reading. Marshall's tomato plants produce fruit from May through to November, and the green fruit that ripens in the house lasts him until the following February (and no, he doesn't live in the Canary Islands, but in West Yorkshire). An intriguing part of his technique includes 'reading the leaves', so plants get the right feed and growing conditions as and when they need them. The book is available through the Organic Gardening Catalogue (01932 253666, or email chaseorg@aol.com). Time to ... Give birds a water supply and check that fish don't get frozen into ponds. A nifty method for the latter is to put a plastic ball on the surface, as the ball floats around in the least breeze and its movement stops the water freezing. What should be avoided is smashing the ice with a hammer: the sound waves reverberate through the water and can be enough of a shock to kill the fish. Plant of the week The name Asian buttercup doesn't convey the plushness of Ranunculus asiaticus . This is probably because it has been substantially bred from its weedy, wildflower origins - modern cultivars such as 'Accolade' have something pleasingly kitsch about them. The only drawback is that R. asiaticus isn't hardy: it will grow well enough outdoors in warm areas, but if in doubt, grow in pots and bring inside in winter, or grow under glass for cut flowers. Plant between now and spring. Weekend readers can buy a ranunculus collection for \u00a315.99, inc UK p&amp;p: the collection consists of five x 15 asiaticus bulbs, comprising 15 yellow, 15 white, 15 red, 15 pink and 15 orange.

      "body": "<p>We are at Centerparcs for the weekend, courtesy of Great-Aunt Elspeth. This sorts out the Wets from the Dry. Ex-Spouse regards exposure to water in any form as torture. I love it. I can float on my back and gaze up at palm trees without the least frisson of post-colonial guilt. The brick paths, the villas discreetly stashed away among evergreens, the bicycling - why, it's almost like living in a Dutch suburb. The only thing missing is a chic little clinic with an Indonesian nurse dispensing sexual therapy, marijuana and euthanasia.</p> <p>\"It's a Designer Village!\" sneers ex-Spouse. \"A cross between Neighbours and Little Red Riding Hood.\" Secretly hope synthetic suburban wolf will slink out of the pinewoods and bite his arse.</p> <p>\"We're on the pull!\" says Harriet after lunch, and cycles off with her friend, Kate, to the Subtropical Swimming Paradise. They're old enough to rampage around the steaming pools in their bikinis without being in danger. Any boys young enough to be at Centerparcs with their parents are clearly going to take a lot of pulling, rather like unripe Bramley apples on a particularly overprotective tree.</p> <p>\"There's rugby on TV this afternoon,\" announces ex-Spouse defiantly, \"so I shall just slump in front of it, okay, just as if I was on planet earth?\" Agree readily. I might feed the two coots who haunt our patio, or I might just go for a brisk walk through the pinewoods.</p> <p>A weekend is not quite long enough, however. The stink of Homework Yet Undone hangs in the air, though Harriet and Kate have promised to hunker down this evening at 6pm sharp. Their homework is to design a biscuit. We never had design when I was a girl; we just muddled along with things being useful and ugly. But everything's designed these days. The February issue of House &amp; Garden contains pictures of a notebook designed to look like a sandwich, furry hot-water bottles and photograph albums covered with fleece, presumably to keep your pin-ups cosy in winter.</p> <p>So why not design a biscuit? For centuries, they've just been flat and brown. How boring! Biscuits should take comfort from the example of soap. For Christmas, somebody gave me a bar of transparent golden soap, in which a palm tree brooded over a sandy shore, like a Jamaican sunset in amber. I have seen heaven in a bar of soap.</p> <p>Why not literary biscuits? Not like Bront\u00eb biscuits - just flat and brown - but biscuits with poems on. A pink biscuit with O Rose Thou Art Sick on it in icing sugar, and a cute, jammy worm poking its head out at the top.</p> <p>Walking through the pine forest, my imagination reeling with exciting biscuits, I wonder why I never went into commerce. Biscuits to match your bathroom! Biscuits to reflect your star sign! I trudge on, but begin to feel cold. Darkness falls, and I realise I am lost - biscuits that bleep when you're near home. Wander through endless pitch-black lanes. Biscuits with a powerful searchlight. A biscuit that is also a mobile phone. The future's orange creams.</p> <p>A tall figure looms ahead. Wonder if Centerparcs is is really crime-free, or if I am about to become an unexpected statistic. Tall figure passes without murdering, though no doubt tempted. Locate villa and rush in hoping for John Inverdale and Jonah Lomu, preferably filled with chocolate and scattered with chopped nuts. Ex-Spouse reports that rugby was dull. Suits you, sir. Best idea of all: biscuit, from photograph supplied by long-suffering wives and ex-wives, bearing the likeness of their rotten husbands. Beyond Relate? Masticate! Bite his head off with your morning coffee.</p> <p>Girls return. \"I've thought of lots of biscuit ideas for you!\" I cry foolishly.</p> <p>\"Oh, we've just realised that we don't have to give it in till Wednesday,\" says Harriet, \"and this is a leisure break, so we're not going to do any homework at all.\" Homework is wasted on the young.</p> <p>Strange how all the things that one hated when young - mashed swede, homework, gardening, the singing of hymns - in time acquire a peculiar sweetness. Wonder if the opposite will happen to my relationship with ex-Spouse, which was quite tender 20 years ago and is now as dry and old as a ship's biscuit.</p>",

      "bodyText": "We are at Centerparcs for the weekend, courtesy of Great-Aunt Elspeth. This sorts out the Wets from the Dry. Ex-Spouse regards exposure to water in any form as torture. I love it. I can float on my back and gaze up at palm trees without the least frisson of post-colonial guilt. The brick paths, the villas discreetly stashed away among evergreens, the bicycling - why, it's almost like living in a Dutch suburb. The only thing missing is a chic little clinic with an Indonesian nurse dispensing sexual therapy, marijuana and euthanasia. \"It's a Designer Village!\" sneers ex-Spouse. \"A cross between Neighbours and Little Red Riding Hood.\" Secretly hope synthetic suburban wolf will slink out of the pinewoods and bite his arse. \"We're on the pull!\" says Harriet after lunch, and cycles off with her friend, Kate, to the Subtropical Swimming Paradise. They're old enough to rampage around the steaming pools in their bikinis without being in danger. Any boys young enough to be at Centerparcs with their parents are clearly going to take a lot of pulling, rather like unripe Bramley apples on a particularly overprotective tree. \"There's rugby on TV this afternoon,\" announces ex-Spouse defiantly, \"so I shall just slump in front of it, okay, just as if I was on planet earth?\" Agree readily. I might feed the two coots who haunt our patio, or I might just go for a brisk walk through the pinewoods. A weekend is not quite long enough, however. The stink of Homework Yet Undone hangs in the air, though Harriet and Kate have promised to hunker down this evening at 6pm sharp. Their homework is to design a biscuit. We never had design when I was a girl; we just muddled along with things being useful and ugly. But everything's designed these days. The February issue of House &amp; Garden contains pictures of a notebook designed to look like a sandwich, furry hot-water bottles and photograph albums covered with fleece, presumably to keep your pin-ups cosy in winter. So why not design a biscuit? For centuries, they've just been flat and brown. How boring! Biscuits should take comfort from the example of soap. For Christmas, somebody gave me a bar of transparent golden soap, in which a palm tree brooded over a sandy shore, like a Jamaican sunset in amber. I have seen heaven in a bar of soap. Why not literary biscuits? Not like Bront\u00eb biscuits - just flat and brown - but biscuits with poems on. A pink biscuit with O Rose Thou Art Sick on it in icing sugar, and a cute, jammy worm poking its head out at the top. Walking through the pine forest, my imagination reeling with exciting biscuits, I wonder why I never went into commerce. Biscuits to match your bathroom! Biscuits to reflect your star sign! I trudge on, but begin to feel cold. Darkness falls, and I realise I am lost - biscuits that bleep when you're near home. Wander through endless pitch-black lanes. Biscuits with a powerful searchlight. A biscuit that is also a mobile phone. The future's orange creams. A tall figure looms ahead. Wonder if Centerparcs is is really crime-free, or if I am about to become an unexpected statistic. Tall figure passes without murdering, though no doubt tempted. Locate villa and rush in hoping for John Inverdale and Jonah Lomu, preferably filled with chocolate and scattered with chopped nuts. Ex-Spouse reports that rugby was dull. Suits you, sir. Best idea of all: biscuit, from photograph supplied by long-suffering wives and ex-wives, bearing the likeness of their rotten husbands. Beyond Relate? Masticate! Bite his head off with your morning coffee. Girls return. \"I've thought of lots of biscuit ideas for you!\" I cry foolishly. \"Oh, we've just realised that we don't have to give it in till Wednesday,\" says Harriet, \"and this is a leisure break, so we're not going to do any homework at all.\" Homework is wasted on the young. Strange how all the things that one hated when young - mashed swede, homework, gardening, the singing of hymns - in time acquire a peculiar sweetness. Wonder if the opposite will happen to my relationship with ex-Spouse, which was quite tender 20 years ago and is now as dry and old as a ship's biscuit.",

      "body": "<p>So, you're driving due south through London on a wet Wednesday in winter. The lunchtime traffic has sludged into a grimy crawl. A few miles on, London loses the will to be London; roads ease up, green spaces become greener and, suddenly, end of journey. Balham. Or, more specifically, a locale dubbed Nappy Valley, Balham. Apparently, the capital boasts several Nappy Valleys, each gouged out in a geological trauma of the double-income mortgage kind, a geo-economic eruption that threw up a rubble of gurgling babies, overflowing skips, mountain-biking dads, Gap-fixated mums and Smeg-infested kitchens.</p> <p>This Nappy Valley is usually a contented place. But, seven weeks ago one family there became encased in misery. Just as Father Christmas was leafing through the south- London pages of his A-to-Z, Chris and Eva Niemyt and their progeny - three-year-old Theo and Louis, just three-and-a-half months - were singled out for special treatment by Dame Flu and her evil cohorts. Big festive family meal? Forget it. Biggish eating on New Year's Eve and Day? Nope. Celebration feast for Chris's birthday at the start of January? Think again. Boiled egg? Just about.</p> <p>Pretty grim. So many excellent excuses to stuff one's face, so little energy to do it. By mid-January, the backlog of blow-out meals was proving unbearable. Which is where Kitchen Doctor Rosie Sykes came in. For, on the wet Wednesday in question, the Niemyts had had enough and called in the KD to cook a belated multi-celebration meal. Now, Rosie Sykes KD - veteran of troubled larders and lauded eateries throughout the realm - is an accommodating and energetic operator.</p> <p>Within minutes of taking the call, she had set out on her mercy dash, via nearby Northcote Road, home of Northcote Fisheries and Dandelion Natural Foods. By midday, she had set up a makeshift intensive-care unit in the Niemyts' kitchen and her finely-honed blade was making the first incisions - across a wig-sized bunch of coriander and a fistful of spring onions. By 1pm, a medium-sized pan was doing its thing, containing dashi (Japanese soup stock based on bonito fish), the coriander stalks - \"I don't believe in waste,\" explains the Doc - the spring onions, a bit of ginger, lime leaves, white wine and lemongrass.</p> <p>This was to be the broth. Next, four red mullet were slashed with the knife and laid to rest in a marinade of basil, lemon, olive oil, salt and pepper. To call these mullet plain \"red\" is to do them a disservice. When fresh - and these were - they shimmer every hue from pale pink to deep, metallic burgundy. In the marinade, they sparkled like jewels.</p> <p>At this point, as the first wisps of salivation-inducing broth vapour began to permeate Niemyt Villas, the pallid Niemyts themselves had more or less scarpered. Whether this was out of respect for the good Doctor and her work, or a desire not to spread their lurgy to the relatively healthy visitors, or simply an urge to hide in the pub until the hard work was done is not clear. Whatever, the result was that, but for a simmering hiss from the stove, sporadic chopping and the occasional snap of a photographer's shutter, the kitchen was becalmed. End of round one.</p> <p>Before the next stage began, Doc Rosie set out the rationale behind her choice of dishes. \"I tried to think of healthy foods, things with clean, simple flavours, but the meal has also to be something vaguely celebratory. Also, Eva is breastfeeding, so ingredients had to be carefully chosen soas not to get any nasty, strong flavours coming through in her breast milk.\"</p> <p>Every corner of the house was by now suffused with a delicate fusion of smells, part oriental, part farmhouse-European. Barely an hour had passed between the lighting of the first gas ring and this higher state of culinary consciousness. Then, suddenly, the KD announced with gravitas, \"the steamed pudding must get underway.\" So it did - ginger cake crumbs, butter, eggs, flour, sugar and all. An hour later, however, the whole process seemed as if it might just be in some peril. Seizing a blender by the throat, Doc Rosie, never one to fluster, observed calmy, \"Um, things are betting a bit, um, mayhemmy now.\"</p> <p>Every few seconds, ingredients moved from one container to another, back and forth, mixing, multiplying, dividing as if trying to evade capture. The pace took off. Blender whirred aggressively, eggs cracked, pots bubbled, dysfunctional carrots jostled with streetwise courgettes, brown sugar squared up to chopped cucumber, the clock ticked, the sink overflowed with used pots and plates, the Japanese seaweed for the salad. The seaweed! The mash! The mash! The seaweed! The foil, the noodles, the prawns, the trade deficit, the phone! The doorbell! The horror. The horror! The garlic! And all the while two representatives of the Guardian hovered over proceedings like a pair of vultures.</p> <p>But only one Rosie to choreograph this chaos into a memorable meal? Did she do it? Fast forward to 4.30pm, and there's Chris, Eva, Louis, Theo and a series of exquisite, subtly aromatic, beautifully presented dishes, as sophisticated as they are simple. As flu remedies go, this one's hard to beat. All recipes serve four.</p> <p><b>Japanese seaweed salad and clear tiger-prawn broth</b><br> Dashi is a Japanese soup stock base, made from bonito. You can get it, and the seaweed, from Asian stores and some high-street supermarkets (health-food shops also sell dried seaweed).</p> <p><b>For the broth</b> <br> 1 packet dashi, dissolved in 750ml water <br> 6 spring onions <br> 16 tiger prawns, preferably uncooked, shells on <br> 1 thumb-sized piece fresh ginger <br> 3 tbsp soy sauce <br> Chinese five-spice powder <br> 6 lime leaves <br> Paprika <br> 1 stalk lemongrass <br> 1 bunch coriander, preferably with roots on <br></p> <p><b>For the seaweed salad</b><br> 200g mixed dried seaweed:<br> kombu, wakame, arame or nori <br> 150g glass noodles <br> 1 bunch chives <br> 1 cucumber <br> 55g mangetout <br> 1 tbsp vegetable oil <br> For the dressing <br> 4 tbsp soy sauce <br> 2 tbsp sesame oil <br> 2 tbsp rice vinegar <br> 1 tbsp sugar</p> <p>First, prepare the broth. Peel and slice the ginger, roughly chop the lemongrass, and put both into a pan, along with the soy sauce, lime leaves and the crushed stalks of the coriander. Add the dashi water. Place on a low flame with a lid on, and allow to infuse for 45 minutes or so. Take off the heat and set aside, covered, until needed.</p> <p>Peel the prawns and throw the shells into the still-warm, resting broth. Sprinkle the prawns with a little five-spice powder and paprika. Slice the spring onions. Wash a couple of leafy coriander branches and pick off the leaves.</p> <p>Ten minutes before serving, strain the broth through a fine sieve and return the pan to the boil. Turn down the heat to a gentle simmer, season the prawns and throw them into the broth - if they are uncooked, they should only take a few minutes to change colour and be ready; if they are already cooked, just give them time to heat through thoroughly.</p> <p>Pour the broth into warm serving bowls, garnish with spring onions and a few coriander leaves, and serve. It's a good idea to prepare the seaweed salad before you complete the final stages of making the broth. If you have kombu seaweed, wash and soak in water for around 30 minutes, drain and simmer gently in clean water until tender. This will take about an hour. For wakame, soak in cold water for 30 minutes. For arame, soak in cold water for 15 minutes. And for nori, simply cut into strips. Cover the glass noodles with boiling salted water and leave to soak for five to six minutes, until softened. Chop the chives, peel and deseed the cucumber, then cut into thin half-moons. Finely slice the mangetout, and saut* briefly in the oil.</p> <p>Finally, whisk together the ingredients for the dressing. Toss the salad mixture in a large bowl, then stir in the dressing. Serve on a small plate beside the soup. (It can be served cold, but is best warmish or at room temperature)</p> <p><b>Red mullet in parma ham, with garlic mash and roasted fennel and courgette</b></p> <p>10 slices Parma ham (or other cured ham, such as Jamon Serrano)<br> 4 red mullet, scaled, gutted, filleted and pin-boned (your fishmonger will do this)<br> 4 tbsp olive oil <br> 1 tbsp lemon juice <br> 1 bunch fresh basil <br> 1 shallot, finely chopped <br> 4 tbsp white wine <br> 4 tbsp fish stock</p> <p>Cut a couple of slits into the skin of each mullet fillet. In a bowl, make a marinade with three tablespoons of the oil, lemon juice, a little roughly chopped basil, salt and black pepper. Lay in the fish, and leave to steep for about 10 minutes. While the fish is marinating, saut* the shallot in half a tablespoon of olive oil for a few minutes until translucent, then pour in the wine. Whack up the heat, and reduce the liquid to a quarter of its original volume. Now add the stock, and reduce the liquor again, this time by half.</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Place a basil leaf on top of each fish fillet, then carefully wrap each one in a slice of ham. Heat an ovenproof frying pan until it is very hot, pour in half a tablespoon of olive oil and add the fish. Fry undisturbed until the ham has crisped up - this should take only a couple of minutes - then turn on to its other side and transfer the pan to the oven for about 10 minutes, or until the fish is cooked. At the same time, bring the winey fish stock back to the boil, gradually whisk in the marinade until you have a very light emulsion, and add a little more chopped basil.</p> <p>Place the fish on a warm dish, and pour the sauce over and around. Serve with the following vegetable dishes:</p> <p><b>For the garlic mash</b> <br> 450g floury potatoes <br> 150ml double cream <br> 10 cloves garlic <br> Salt and pepper</p> <p>Peel and chop the potatoes into evenly-sized pieces, pop them into a large pan of well-salted water, along with five unpeeled cloves of garlic. Bring the whole lot to the boil and simmer gently until the potatoes are tender. In a separate pan, combine the cream, the remaining five cloves of garlic, peeled this time, some salt and pepper. Bring this mixture carefully to the boil. Once boiled, remove the pan from the heat and leave the garlic flavour to infuse into the cream for at least 15 minutes, and preferably for a half-hour or even longer.</p> <p>Whizz up the cream mixture in a blender until it is completely smooth in texture, and then set to one side. Drain the cooked potatoes and garlic, squeezing the latter out of their skins, and then mash well together. When you are ready to serve, pour the garlic milk into a pan, add a couple of large tablespoonfuls of butter, bring to a simmer, season, then beat into the mash. Serve at once.</p> <p><b>For the roasted fennel and courgette</b> <br> 4 fennel bulbs <br> 4 courgettes <br> Olive oil <br> Salt and pepper</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/ gas mark 6. Cut the fennel bulbs into eighths, and the courgette into batons of a similar size. Toss the veg in olive oil, season, and bake until tender and crispy on the outside - for around 40 minutes, or so.</p> <p><b>Steamed ginger pudding with honey and honey custard</b><br> 5 tbsp honey <br> 150g crumbled fresh ginger cake <br> 25g self-raising flour <br> 100g soft brown sugar <br> 100g crystallised ginger, with its syrup <br> 125g butter <br> 3 large eggs <br> 1 level tsp bicarbonate of soda <br> 2 tbsp milk or lemon juice</p> <p>Melt 25g of the butter, brush a two-pint pudding basin with it. Pour the honey into the bottom of the basin. Combine the crumbled cake and flour in a mixing bowl. Put the remaining butter, and the ginger and syrup in a food processor, and pulse until the ginger is roughly chopped. Melt the resultant mixture in a small pan. In another bowl, whisk the eggs and sugar until frothy and slightly thickened. Stir the butter-and-ginger mixture into the crumb-and-flour bowl, then stir in the eggs. Dissolve the bicarb in the milk/ lemon juice, and amalgamate with the mixture in the bowl.</p> <p>Pour into the pudding basin, cover with greaseproof paper, pleated in the middle to let the pudding to rise. Fasten with an elastic band and wrap again with foil. Secure this with string, using enough to make a handle. Place the package in a large pan, pour in boiling water to come halfway up the sides of the basin, cover, and simmer gently for an an hour and three quarters. Top up the water as necessary. The pudding is ready when it is firm to the touch.</p> <p><b>For the honey custard</b> <br> 4 egg yolks <br> 8 tbsp honey <br> 150ml milk <br> 100ml cream</p> <p>Pour the milk and cream into a pan, bring to the boil and scald briefly. Beat together the egg yolks and honey, pour this into the milk-cream mixture and return to the heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until thickened. Pour through a sieve into a warmed jug</p> <p>\u0095 Do you have a culinary dilemma? Never got to grips with baking, say, or have fussy eaters coming to stay?

Peel and slice the ginger, roughly chop the lemongrass, and put both into a pan, along with the soy sauce, lime leaves and the crushed stalks of the coriander. Add the dashi water. Place on a low flame with a lid on, and allow to infuse for 45 minutes or so. Take off the heat and set aside, covered, until needed. Peel the prawns and throw the shells into the still-warm, resting broth. Sprinkle the prawns with a little five-spice powder and paprika. Slice the spring onions. Wash a couple of leafy coriander branches and pick off the leaves. Ten minutes before serving, strain the broth through a fine sieve and return the pan to the boil. Turn down the heat to a gentle simmer, season the prawns and throw them into the broth - if they are uncooked, they should only take a few minutes to change colour and be ready; if they are already cooked, just give them time to heat through thoroughly. Pour the broth into warm serving bowls, garnish with spring onions and a few coriander leaves, and serve. It's a good idea to prepare the seaweed salad before you complete the final stages of making the broth. If you have kombu seaweed, wash and soak in water for around 30 minutes, drain and simmer gently in clean water until tender. This will take about an hour. For wakame, soak in cold water for 30 minutes. For arame, soak in cold water for 15 minutes. And for nori, simply cut into strips. Cover the glass noodles with boiling salted water and leave to soak for five to six minutes, until softened. Chop the chives, peel and deseed the cucumber, then cut into thin half-moons. Finely slice the mangetout, and saut* briefly in the oil. Finally, whisk together the ingredients for the dressing. Toss the salad mixture in a large bowl, then stir in the dressing. Serve on a small plate beside the soup. (It can be served cold, but is best warmish or at room temperature) Red mullet in parma ham, with garlic mash and roasted fennel and courgette 10 slices Parma ham (or other cured ham, such as Jamon Serrano) 4 red mullet, scaled, gutted, filleted and pin-boned (your fishmonger will do this) 4 tbsp olive oil 1 tbsp lemon juice 1 bunch fresh basil 1 shallot, finely chopped 4 tbsp white wine 4 tbsp fish stock Cut a couple of slits into the skin of each mullet fillet. In a bowl, make a marinade with three tablespoons of the oil, lemon juice, a little roughly chopped basil, salt and black pepper. Lay in the fish, and leave to steep for about 10 minutes. While the fish is marinating, saut* the shallot in half a tablespoon of olive oil for a few minutes until translucent, then pour in the wine. Whack up the heat, and reduce the liquid to a quarter of its original volume. Now add the stock, and reduce the liquor again, this time by half. Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Place a basil leaf on top of each fish fillet, then carefully wrap each one in a slice of ham. Heat an ovenproof frying pan until it is very hot, pour in half a tablespoon of olive oil and add the fish. Fry undisturbed until the ham has crisped up - this should take only a couple of minutes - then turn on to its other side and transfer the pan to the oven for about 10 minutes, or until the fish is cooked. At the same time, bring the winey fish stock back to the boil, gradually whisk in the marinade until you have a very light emulsion, and add a little more chopped basil. Place the fish on a warm dish, and pour the sauce over and around. Serve with the following vegetable dishes: For the garlic mash 450g floury potatoes 150ml double cream 10 cloves garlic Salt and pepper Peel and chop the potatoes into evenly-sized pieces, pop them into a large pan of well-salted water, along with five unpeeled cloves of garlic. Bring the whole lot to the boil and simmer gently until the potatoes are tender. In a separate pan, combine the cream, the remaining five cloves of garlic, peeled this time, some salt and pepper. Bring this mixture carefully to the boil. Once boiled, remove the pan from the heat and leave the garlic flavour to infuse into the cream for at least 15 minutes, and preferably for a half-hour or even longer. Whizz up the cream mixture in a blender until it is completely smooth in texture, and then set to one side. Drain the cooked potatoes and garlic, squeezing the latter out of their skins, and then mash well together. When you are ready to serve, pour the garlic milk into a pan, add a couple of large tablespoonfuls of butter, bring to a simmer, season, then beat into the mash. Serve at once. For the roasted fennel and courgette 4 fennel bulbs 4 courgettes Olive oil Salt and pepper Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/ gas mark 6. Cut the fennel bulbs into eighths, and the courgette into batons of a similar size. Toss the veg in olive oil, season, and bake until tender and crispy on the outside - for around 40 minutes, or so. Steamed ginger pudding with honey and honey custard 5 tbsp honey 150g crumbled fresh ginger cake 25g self-raising flour 100g soft brown sugar 100g crystallised ginger, with its syrup 125g butter 3 large eggs 1 level tsp bicarbonate of soda 2 tbsp milk or lemon juice Melt 25g of the butter, brush a two-pint pudding basin with it. Pour the honey into the bottom of the basin. Combine the crumbled cake and flour in a mixing bowl. Put the remaining butter, and the ginger and syrup in a food processor, and pulse until the ginger is roughly chopped. Melt the resultant mixture in a small pan. In another bowl, whisk the eggs and sugar until frothy and slightly thickened. Stir the butter-and-ginger mixture into the crumb-and-flour bowl, then stir in the eggs. Dissolve the bicarb in the milk/ lemon juice, and amalgamate with the mixture in the bowl. Pour into the pudding basin, cover with greaseproof paper, pleated in the middle to let the pudding to rise. Fasten with an elastic band and wrap again with foil. Secure this with string, using enough to make a handle. Place the package in a large pan, pour in boiling water to come halfway up the sides of the basin, cover, and simmer gently for an an hour and three quarters. Top up the water as necessary. The pudding is ready when it is firm to the touch. For the honey custard 4 egg yolks 8 tbsp honey 150ml milk 100ml cream Pour the milk and cream into a pan, bring to the boil and scald briefly. Beat together the egg yolks and honey, pour this into the milk-cream mixture and return to the heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until thickened. Pour through a sieve into a warmed jug \u0095 Do you have a culinary dilemma? Never got to grips with baking, say, or have fussy eaters coming to stay?

Police hunt killer of MP's niece Police were yesterday hunting for the murderer of an SDLP MP's niece whose naked body was found on a beach in Londonderry. Julie Hamill, 28, was found stripped and strangled on Thursday morning at Portstewart. She had last been seen at a nightclub in Portrush, Co Antrim, where she lived. Ms Hamill was a niece of the South Down MP Eddie McGrady and originally came from Downpatrick, Co Down. The RUC said her body was found by a jogger. A postmortem showed she had been murdered. Detectives said they had discovered no motive for the killing, but said she had not been sexually assaulted. The woman's clothes have not been found.",

Detectives do not know why she was there, but believe she was murdered overnight. </p> <p><b> Masterpiece found in car</b><br> </p> <p> A stolen \u00a3400,000 masterpiece has been found by police in the back of a car. </p> <p>The miniature, entitled Portrait of Mary Clarke, by John Singleton Copley, was found after police stopped a car in Highbury, north London, yesterday. </p> <p>It was stolen from the Spink Leger gallery in Old Bond Street, central London, on January 5. A 62-year-old man was arrested.</p> <p><b> Pair killed in car park plunge</b><br> </p> <p>Two men died yesterday when their car plunged from the top of a five-storey car park in Bedford. Investigators will be considering whether the car's automatic gearbox contributed to the incident. A police spokesman said the car was travelling at a relatively slow speed when it toppled from the All Hallows car park. No one else was hurt in the incident. </p> <p>The victims have yet to be identified. </p> <p><b> Lottery to keep rollover limit</b><br> </p> <p> Lottery players were last night denied the hope of an unlimited jackpot when the lottery regulator refused to scrap the limit on the number of times the game's top prize can roll over. </p> <p>Under the game's original rules, there could be no more than three rollovers, where winner-less jackpots are added to the next draw. </p> <p>Culture secretary Chris Smith announced yesterday that he would allow the lottery commission to scrap the limit. </p> <p>However, the commission said it would keep Camelot, the lottery operator, tied to the restriction. </p> <p>\"We have no immediate plans to change the rules.\" a spokesman said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Death crash student jailed A former public schoolboy with links to the royal family has been jailed for four-and-a-half years for killing a student while drink-driving in Oxford. Student William Hobbs, 21, the son of Sir Michael Hobbs, a friend of the Duke of Edinburgh, was more than three times over the legal drink drive limit when he hit Sarah Westwood, 20, as she pushed her bicycle on April 25 last year. He pleaded guilty at Oxford crown court to causing death by dangerous driving. Police name murder girl Police have named a teenager found stabbed to death in a Liverpool street. Victoria O'Hara, 17, from the Walton area of the city, died from multiple stab wounds to the chest. Her body was found on Wednesday morning near a builder's yard in the city's Kirkdale area. Detectives do not know why she was there, but believe she was murdered overnight. Masterpiece found in car A stolen \u00a3400,000 masterpiece has been found by police in the back of a car. The miniature, entitled Portrait of Mary Clarke, by John Singleton Copley, was found after police stopped a car in Highbury, north London, yesterday. It was stolen from the Spink Leger gallery in Old Bond Street, central London, on January 5. A 62-year-old man was arrested. Pair killed in car park plunge Two men died yesterday when their car plunged from the top of a five-storey car park in Bedford. Investigators will be considering whether the car's automatic gearbox contributed to the incident. A police spokesman said the car was travelling at a relatively slow speed when it toppled from the All Hallows car park. No one else was hurt in the incident. The victims have yet to be identified. Lottery to keep rollover limit Lottery players were last night denied the hope of an unlimited jackpot when the lottery regulator refused to scrap the limit on the number of times the game's top prize can roll over. Under the game's original rules, there could be no more than three rollovers, where winner-less jackpots are added to the next draw. Culture secretary Chris Smith announced yesterday that he would allow the lottery commission to scrap the limit. However, the commission said it would keep Camelot, the lottery operator, tied to the restriction. \"We have no immediate plans to change the rules.\" a spokesman said.",

The four fields, which would be worth millions with planning consent, are on the outskirts of Henwick, near Thatcham, in one of the most desirable parts of the county's stockbroker belt. Mr Justice Neuberger ruled that the farmer's widow and her father were, as his personal representatives, entitled to possession of the land, which was bought more than 20 years ago by a property development company.

They kept the disputed acres because of their development potential. Managing director Graham Pye told the judge that he had always intended to keep the land until planning permission could be obtained.

The misses Gormenghast The lavish BBC2 drama has lost 40% of its viewers since its opening episode - with ratings falling from 4.2m to 2.5m. Rhodes An unprecedented flop. The \u00a310m BBC1 production about the story of Cecil Rhodes and the founding of Rhodesia boasted superb scenery and Martin Shaw as the star. The 1996 serial slumped to 4.8m viewers, from 7.6m, after just one episode. Hornblower Despite being - at \u00a312m - the most expensive TV dramatisation ever, ITV's seafaring saga drew in just 6m viewers. The cherubic Ioan Gruffudd in breeches was insufficient compensation for a lack of strong females. Nostromo \"Don't touch Conrad,\" the novelist and academic David Lodge warned BBC1 after they had commissioned this adaptation. The four-part 1997 serial flopped, drawing in less than 3m viewers. Vanity Fair Not an unmitigated disaster, but Andrew Davies' 1998 adaptation of Thackery's novel was initially dubbed \"Vanity Flop\" after the 7.8m who tuned into the first episode slumped to 6.8m a week later. It was beaten by the 9.9m who tuned in for the ITV detective series, Taggart.",

      "bodyText": "Areas of the City of London were brought to a standstill yesterday after bomb threats were issued by the Animal Liberation Front, which was protesting against a controversial animal laboratory. The hoax calls were made against major shareholders in Huntingdon Life Sciences, a Cambridgeshire laboratory condemned by the government three years ago and in which the Labour party's pension fund was recently found to have an investment. An ALF spokesman, while refusing to confirm that the organisation had threatened up to eight City institutions, said the action was probably timed to coincide with today's \"national campaign\" against shareholders in the laboratory. Among the firms whose offices were evacuated after yesterday's threats were Legal &amp; General and Phillips &amp; Drew, both highly-respected fund management groups. Police refused to confirm the identity of the companies, but said hoax calls at just before 11am from the ALF threatened a series of explosions between 11.15am and 11.30am. Evacuations saw thousands of office workers spilling out on to the streets of the City in Lombard Street, Aldgate and Cheapside. Barclays bank also received a hoax call and evacuated its head office for four hours. The Huntingdon laboratory first sparked controversy in April 1997 after conditions at the Cambridgeshire research centre were declared to be unsatisfactory. Its licence was revoked for six months. Phillips &amp; Drew said it was unaware that the threat was connected to Huntingdon, in which it still holds an 11% stake. Its holding was exposed a fortnight ago when it emerged that it had invested money for the Labour party's pension scheme in the company. The Labour party said last week that P&amp;D had since sold the 75,000 Huntingdon shares in which its pension fund had invested.

Speaking to the Institute of Irish Studies, in Liverpool, he said: \"I know the passions that an attempt to force decommissioning arouses. I am not naive.</p> <p>\"Surrendering long fought and hardline political ground is one thing. Appearing to be forced to surrender altogether is quite another.

      "bodyText": "Peter Mandelson launched a dramatic attempt to rescue the Northern Ireland peace process yesterday, by reassuring the IRA that it would not have to disarm by next week to prevent the reimposition of direct rule. Amid signs of government alarm at Sinn Fein's angry reaction to his statement in the Commons on Thursday night, Mr Mandelson made it clear that he was looking for words rather than actions. Speaking in Liverpool, the Northern Ireland secretary called for \"clear changes for the better to give confidence that decommissioning will happen\". His remarks fell well short of the Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble's demand for an actual start to IRA disarmament to allow him to continue in government with Sinn Fein. Mr Mandelson's conciliatory speech came only hours after Sinn Fein reacted furiously to his warning that direct rule would be restored next week if the IRA refused to make a gesture on decommissioning. The Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, condemned Mr Mandelson's commons statement as a \"disgrace\". He added: \"At the time when we were actually talking to the IRA, what does Peter Mandelson do? He accuses them of betraying the process. Spin-doctoring for Glengall Street [the Ulster Unionist Party headquarters] was not in Peter Mandelson's remit.\" Sinn Fein took particular exception to Mr Mandelson's criticism of the IRA for its \"totally unacceptable\" refusal to disarm which was a \"betrayal\" of everybody in Northern Ireland, including republicans. Yesterday, Mr Mandelson redressed the balance when he said he appreciated the difficulties republicans faced over decommissioning. Speaking to the Institute of Irish Studies, in Liverpool, he said: \"I know the passions that an attempt to force decommissioning arouses. I am not naive. \"Surrendering long fought and hardline political ground is one thing. Appearing to be forced to surrender altogether is quite another. That's why decommissioning is a voluntary contribution to the process of building trust. But it is also necessary in order to move forward.\" He warned that direct rule would be restored next week if the IRA fails to make a gesture on disarmament, but he made clear that arms would not have to be decommissioned by then. \"If there are no clear changes for the better to give confidence that decommissioning will happen, I will put on hold the operation of the institutions,\" he said. His remarks were echoed by Tony Blair, who called for guarantees that decommissioning would start. \"There has to be clarity. There has got to be certainty.\" The reassurance that the IRA will not have to disarm within the next week - which was stated implicitly in Mr Mandelson's commons statement, horrified sources close to Mr Trimble, who spent the day in crisis talks with senior members of his party. Mr Trimble was due to resign as first minister yesterday, but this appears to have been held off until next week. There was speculation last night that Mr Mandelson would settle for a timetable from the IRA, spelling out how it would disarm. Unionists made clear that this would be unacceptable. One unionist observer said last night: \"We could be in for another crisis this time next week, but this time all the pressure would be on David Trimble to accept a gesture from republicans.\" Mr Adams met the IRA yesterday, fuelling speculation that the provisionals might still be prepared to make a gesture within the next week. A Sinn Fein source said that Mr Adams was working \"day and night\" to reach a deal. Meanwhile, the government published the parliamentary bill which would reimpose direct rule if there is no movement on decommissioning. Under the bill, the Stormont assembly and all its committees would no longer be able to meet, and ministers would cease to hold office.",

The result was Labour's worst parliamentary performance in this large, rural constituency. Analysts believe the party's campaign was not helped by recent comments from the prime minister on the state of the rural economy. The victorious Plaid Cymru candidate, Simon Thomas, who comfortably held on to a seat the nationalists have controlled since 1992, said Plaid had won on a policy of \"fair play\" for farmers and public services, in particular the health service. Mr Thomas, who sports an earring, said Labour had turned its back on the constituency, which was a Liberal seat for most of the last century. Labour, which was pushed into fourth place by the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats, saw its share of the vote collapse from 24.3% at the last general election to 14.4% on a 46% turnout. It has historically come third in the seat and committed few national resources to the campaign this year. The party was second to Plaid in the 1997 general election landslide and again at last year's national assembly elections. Dafydd Trystan, an election trends analyst at the Institute of Welsh Politics in Aberystwyth, said the party's vote had disappeared in rural areas of the constituency and was poor even in its traditionally strong council estate areas. \"You can't tell overmuch about the pattern of Welsh politics from Ceredigion but it does suggest the way the wind is blowing. \"It is clearly not good news for Labour and it is not what they would have hoped for in the run-up to the potential vote of no confidence.\" Labour officials remained determined to put a brave face on the outcome which they described as disappointing but not devastating. There was some comfort that the party's share of the vote was down by no more than 1.3% on last year's Welsh assembly elections. \"We fought a hard campaign and had the best candidate,\" said a party spokesman. \"This was a parliamentary election. We never accepted that it was a referendum on the assembly or on the no-confidence vote.\" As Labour licked its wounds, there was a buoyant mood among the Liberal Democrats, who almost doubled their share of the vote. The Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, hailed the result as spectacular. \"It demonstrates we are on course to make substantial gains at the next general election. It is a timely shot across Labour's bows when the government is doing less than it promised for public services and rural areas.\" Mr Thomas, 36, a Welsh-speaking rural community development officer who was the co-author of Plaid Cymru's national assembly election manifesto, claimed the outcome was a vote of confidence in the future of Wales. The father of two said the result sent a clear message to Labour about the way it was running Wales. \"It is also a clear message for Alun Michael and the way the assembly is going. \"I had a lot of complaints as I went around town that the assembly is failing because of leadership.

Five days after Peter Kilfoyle resigned his ministerial office to concentrate on nurturing support for Labour's heartlands - and 24 hours after the party was pushed into fourth place in a rural Welsh byelection - Mr Prescott moved to calm the fears of Labour's restless backbenchers, union backers and activists by admitting the danger of waning support. Labour ignored key supporters in the north, Wales and Scotland at its peril. \"We should never lose sight of the fact that it is the ordinary people of this country who we are working for,\" he warned.

But unlike previous governments we have still not lost a byelection we should have won,\" said a Millbank analyst who admitted the party in Wales had not yet recovered from the problems over devolution and Ron Davies's \"moment of madness\" on distant Clapham Common. The result - which sends Plaid's Simon Thomas to Westminster -is likely to clinch the nationalists' hopes of winning a vote of no confidence in Alun Michael, the first minister of Wales, probably next Wednesday. Neither his nor Mr Blair's photographs were used until the last minute in the Ceredigion campaign. \"They're both too unpopular,\" an MP said. Labour's annual local government conference opened yesterday in Blackpool, with the deputy prime minister holding the fort for Mr Blair, who will speak tomorrow. Mr Prescott was careful to match his concern about a disillusioned rank and file with strong criticism of backbench dissidents who complain that New Labour is little better than the Tories. Feelings are running high in the regions - despite Mr Blair's insistence that Gordon Brown's employment policies are benefiting them the most. Outright dissidence is not the gut-loyal Mr Kilfoyle's line.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The world's great ballet companies sometimes resemble a Proustian circle of aristocrats: each \"family\" takes passionate pride in its own lineage, yet is haunted by the competition. Which has the most precious heritage, the most elegant women, the most solid future? </p> <p>As the Royal Ballet searches for a director to take over from Anthony Dowell next year, and considers its course in the new century, this monitoring has become blatant. The company is scouring the world to see if anyone else orders their affairs better. The closest source of comparison, Paris Opera, is also one of the most interesting because it does things very differently. </p> <p>Paris Opera is older than the Royal Ballet, with a blood line dating back to the 17th century. Its stringent, hierarchical system breeds great dancers, whose superiority it has always asserted. However, it's not such fertile ground for new choreographers: most of the new repertory has to be bought in. </p> <p>For all that, Paris displays an impressive willingness to experiment. Recent acquisitions include works by Pina Bausch, William Forsythe, Mats Ek and Ohad Naharin. The obvious advantage to this international mix is that it creates versatile dancers and adventurous audiences. There is, however, a danger that such diversity can look arbitrary - a flaky response to fashion that cannot develop the continuity between dancers and choreographers so dear to the Royal. </p> <p>Recently Paris Opera seems to have reconciled the demands of fashion and continuity by forging a relationship with one of its guest choreographers, 43-year-old Angelin Preljocaj, who's made four works for its dancers in five years. </p> <p>Preljocaj is French by a matter of five days, having been born in the country just after his parents fled there from communist Albania. Growing up, he benefited from the prodigal arts funding in France; by 1984 he'd formed his own group and by 1996 he was installed in purpose-built premises in Aix-en-Provence. His personal idiom is grounded in the blunt, uncompromising physicality of postmodern dance. But he's aesthetically non-partisan and he travels easily between modern and classical forms. As he's said, \"To me, a body falling to the floor isn't any more or less beautiful than an arabesque.\" </p> <p>This makes him a prized rarity among choreographers, an artist with a grip on the 21st century who can also do justice to the thoroughbred skills of classical dancers. Casanova, his latest work for Paris, may be headed by soloists and \u00e9toiles (principals), but the work itself, epic in scale, high-tech in staging, blending pure dance with spoken text, looks like nothing I've seen on an opera house stage. </p> <p>The ballet is not a traditional costume drama - it doesn't even have a single dancer playing the title role. Rather it's an anatomisation of the libertine's world as exemplified by Casanova's life. Moving though eight symbolic tableaux, it focuses intensely on the conflicting \"humours\" of the professional lover. Desire is imaged as a violent disruption of routine, and as a claustrophobic, deadly repeating scenario of seduction and satiation.

      "bodyText": "The world's great ballet companies sometimes resemble a Proustian circle of aristocrats: each \"family\" takes passionate pride in its own lineage, yet is haunted by the competition. Which has the most precious heritage, the most elegant women, the most solid future? As the Royal Ballet searches for a director to take over from Anthony Dowell next year, and considers its course in the new century, this monitoring has become blatant. The company is scouring the world to see if anyone else orders their affairs better. The closest source of comparison, Paris Opera, is also one of the most interesting because it does things very differently. Paris Opera is older than the Royal Ballet, with a blood line dating back to the 17th century. Its stringent, hierarchical system breeds great dancers, whose superiority it has always asserted. However, it's not such fertile ground for new choreographers: most of the new repertory has to be bought in. For all that, Paris displays an impressive willingness to experiment. Recent acquisitions include works by Pina Bausch, William Forsythe, Mats Ek and Ohad Naharin. The obvious advantage to this international mix is that it creates versatile dancers and adventurous audiences. There is, however, a danger that such diversity can look arbitrary - a flaky response to fashion that cannot develop the continuity between dancers and choreographers so dear to the Royal. Recently Paris Opera seems to have reconciled the demands of fashion and continuity by forging a relationship with one of its guest choreographers, 43-year-old Angelin Preljocaj, who's made four works for its dancers in five years. Preljocaj is French by a matter of five days, having been born in the country just after his parents fled there from communist Albania. Growing up, he benefited from the prodigal arts funding in France; by 1984 he'd formed his own group and by 1996 he was installed in purpose-built premises in Aix-en-Provence. His personal idiom is grounded in the blunt, uncompromising physicality of postmodern dance. But he's aesthetically non-partisan and he travels easily between modern and classical forms. As he's said, \"To me, a body falling to the floor isn't any more or less beautiful than an arabesque.\" This makes him a prized rarity among choreographers, an artist with a grip on the 21st century who can also do justice to the thoroughbred skills of classical dancers. Casanova, his latest work for Paris, may be headed by soloists and \u00e9toiles (principals), but the work itself, epic in scale, high-tech in staging, blending pure dance with spoken text, looks like nothing I've seen on an opera house stage. The ballet is not a traditional costume drama - it doesn't even have a single dancer playing the title role. Rather it's an anatomisation of the libertine's world as exemplified by Casanova's life. Moving though eight symbolic tableaux, it focuses intensely on the conflicting \"humours\" of the professional lover. Desire is imaged as a violent disruption of routine, and as a claustrophobic, deadly repeating scenario of seduction and satiation. Sex is conquest and tenderness, and coldly voyeuristic lust. The work also creates a startlingly dual perspective of the body - presenting it externally as an active object and internally as a system of sensations and tissue over which the lover has little control. This duality was specially pertinent to Casanova, who was a victim of venereal disease. The more active his adventures, the more his body suffered. The more eagerly he sought the timeless moment of orgasm, the more inexorably time marched against him. These are complicated ideas for ballet, yet the work's design - created by Thierry Leproust and Preljocaj himself - is astonishingly evocative.

That humorous moment was surpassed when Heick started laughing and Bona himself had to stop playing, seized by hilarity. \"How about a surprise?\" he chuckled. \"That's what makes the music so beautiful, and that's what beautiful about Ronnie Scott's.

      "body": "<p>My friend Stephen Pile planned to attend the opening of 19:20 in Clerkenwell, London, which is billed as \"the first ever feng shui restaurant\". Stephen rightly thought that I, as someone who regards feng shui as a silly, superstitious moneyspinner for mountebanks, would like to join him. The press release alone was beguiling. \"The guys behind 19:20 are Robbie O'Neill and Shaun Wilson, the joint creative force behind such groovy ventures as Beach Blanket Babylon, The Mwah Mwah Bar...\" </p> <p>It turns out that I have mis-spelled the name; since the numbers one, two and three are critical in feng shui, there should be three vertical dots rather than two between the 19 and the 20. Sadly the Guardian's typeface is not yet feng shui-compatible. </p> <p>Anyhow, I learned that Alessandro Picchio, the consultant, determined that Robbie and Shaun should focus on burnt oranges, browns and Mediterranean colours. \"He took a compass reading of the building and divided it into nine areas of influence... including 'Contemplation': as people enter, they may contemplate whether they want the bar downstairs or the restaurant at street level\". Then there is \"the Journey area\", which turns out to mean the stairs, and \"the Helpful area: the fire escape - very useful in an emergency.\" Don't miss \"the prosperity area - the cash register\". </p> <p>It certainly had my gastric juices spurting. Sadly, however, the vital chi force seems to have been flowing uphill. The launch had to be postponed because, in their feng shui enthusiasm, the owners completely forgot to apply in time for a drinks licence. </p> <p> \u0095 A bad week for George W Bush, defeated in New Hampshire and thrashed by the political commentator Kevin Phillips in an article in the new edition of the American Harper's magazine. Among other things we learn that \"Dubya's\" party piece is his impression of Dr Evil in the Austin Powers films, and (this one amazed me) \"his own mother made him sit at the opposite end of the dinner table from the Queen of England, for fear of what he might say, when he was 44 years old\". </p> <p> \u0095 I was delighted to see how annoyed Richard Branson was in his letter to the Guardian this week, complaining about my remarks last Saturday. What he failed to point out, still less address, was the fact that his long distance rail services are officially, by every measure, the worst in the country. </p> <p>My overall point was that only Virgin and its agencies regard the Virgin brand image as cool, modern or appealing to customers. Our local department store is offering its positively final reductions on menswear. Virgin logo shirts, made by the Virgin Clothing Company, are marked down from \u00a340 to \u00a315. I couldn't check every garment in the shop, but that was the biggest reduction I saw. </p> <p>\u0095 I was born in Ashton, Lancs, and my mother came from Stalybridge, a short bus trip from Hyde, which now, thanks to Dr Shipman and the Moors killers, seems to be the mass murder capital of Britain. It's hard to know why. I always found the whole place immensely friendly, and have only happy memories of visiting relatives in rows of tiny terrace houses. Even without the benefit of feng shui consultants, they knew to keep their toilets outside the house. </p> <p>Far from being sinister burial grounds, the moors were a vast open park where you could walk for miles and get away from the soot which hung in the air, sometimes seemingly as thick as snow in a blizzard. People round there still have their own distinct accent, which most Mancunians could place with a precision worthy of Professor Higgins: a \"buke\" for example is a magazine. What we call a book is a \"lyberary buke\" whether it comes from the library or not. </p> <p>People still emigrate from the area, though not because they fear imminent assassination. Years ago I went to visit my Uncle Jack in Sydney.

      "bodyText": "My friend Stephen Pile planned to attend the opening of 19:20 in Clerkenwell, London, which is billed as \"the first ever feng shui restaurant\". Stephen rightly thought that I, as someone who regards feng shui as a silly, superstitious moneyspinner for mountebanks, would like to join him. The press release alone was beguiling. \"The guys behind 19:20 are Robbie O'Neill and Shaun Wilson, the joint creative force behind such groovy ventures as Beach Blanket Babylon, The Mwah Mwah Bar...\" It turns out that I have mis-spelled the name; since the numbers one, two and three are critical in feng shui, there should be three vertical dots rather than two between the 19 and the 20. Sadly the Guardian's typeface is not yet feng shui-compatible. Anyhow, I learned that Alessandro Picchio, the consultant, determined that Robbie and Shaun should focus on burnt oranges, browns and Mediterranean colours. \"He took a compass reading of the building and divided it into nine areas of influence... including 'Contemplation': as people enter, they may contemplate whether they want the bar downstairs or the restaurant at street level\". Then there is \"the Journey area\", which turns out to mean the stairs, and \"the Helpful area: the fire escape - very useful in an emergency.\" Don't miss \"the prosperity area - the cash register\". It certainly had my gastric juices spurting. Sadly, however, the vital chi force seems to have been flowing uphill. The launch had to be postponed because, in their feng shui enthusiasm, the owners completely forgot to apply in time for a drinks licence. \u0095 A bad week for George W Bush, defeated in New Hampshire and thrashed by the political commentator Kevin Phillips in an article in the new edition of the American Harper's magazine. Among other things we learn that \"Dubya's\" party piece is his impression of Dr Evil in the Austin Powers films, and (this one amazed me) \"his own mother made him sit at the opposite end of the dinner table from the Queen of England, for fear of what he might say, when he was 44 years old\". \u0095 I was delighted to see how annoyed Richard Branson was in his letter to the Guardian this week, complaining about my remarks last Saturday. What he failed to point out, still less address, was the fact that his long distance rail services are officially, by every measure, the worst in the country. My overall point was that only Virgin and its agencies regard the Virgin brand image as cool, modern or appealing to customers. Our local department store is offering its positively final reductions on menswear. Virgin logo shirts, made by the Virgin Clothing Company, are marked down from \u00a340 to \u00a315. I couldn't check every garment in the shop, but that was the biggest reduction I saw. \u0095 I was born in Ashton, Lancs, and my mother came from Stalybridge, a short bus trip from Hyde, which now, thanks to Dr Shipman and the Moors killers, seems to be the mass murder capital of Britain. It's hard to know why. I always found the whole place immensely friendly, and have only happy memories of visiting relatives in rows of tiny terrace houses. Even without the benefit of feng shui consultants, they knew to keep their toilets outside the house. Far from being sinister burial grounds, the moors were a vast open park where you could walk for miles and get away from the soot which hung in the air, sometimes seemingly as thick as snow in a blizzard. People round there still have their own distinct accent, which most Mancunians could place with a precision worthy of Professor Higgins: a \"buke\" for example is a magazine. What we call a book is a \"lyberary buke\" whether it comes from the library or not. People still emigrate from the area, though not because they fear imminent assassination. Years ago I went to visit my Uncle Jack in Sydney. He had married an Australian woman he met during the second world war, set up as an electrician, worked very hard, and was able to buy a magnificent house in the suburbs, a few minutes from the beach. He had a big car in the driveway, a split-level house with a vast wooden deck, and a swimming pool surrounded by hummingbird-infested tropical shrubs. I gazed at it all in awe. \"Uncle Jack,\" I said, \"this is magnificent.\" \"Aye,\" he said, his accent quite unchanged in 40 years, \"nicer than Stalybridge, 'ent it?\" He was right of course, but only up to a point. \u0095 Mythical facts continue to arrive by every post.

      "body": "<p>The reactionary winds of Northern Irish society have rattled many teacups down the years in the area of the arts. Take last November's placard-wielding Free Presbyterian pickets outside the Ormeau Baths Gallery, after a brightly coloured invitation to the opening of Gilbert &amp; George's Human Shit pictures landed on Ian Paisley's desk. </p> <p>Or last summer's decision by the Northern Irish Arts Council to withdraw funding from a West Belfast \"community drama\" called Forced Upon Us - a big, Republican peat-shovel into the early history of the RUC and the Protestant statelet. Written and acted by a local team, including some former IRA prisoners, it might have sunk without trace; but its director, the respected left-winger Pam Brighton, ensured there was an outcry about censorship, and a good half-acre of newsprint. </p> <p>Sex and politics also pop up relentlessly in the work of 37-year-old actor-playwright Joe Crilly, whose new work, On McQuillan's Hill, is just about to open at the Lyric Theatre in Belfast. </p> <p>Crilly's first play, Second Hand Thunder, caused quite a stir in 1988 with its irreverent look at life beneath the sashes in Orange County, rural mid-Ulster. Although set against a scantily fictionalised Drumcree, it was a homey old-style rural drama about the dysfunctional family of an Orange Grand Master, landowner and UDR man, whose respectability was compromised by his rape of a young teacher. The resultant son was hushed up, but grew up a pleasant, normal lad - a source of embarrassment to the comic double-act of the UDR man's other lame-brained sons. </p> <p>It was a cleverly constructed piece which, flashing back and forwards over 20 years had a taut handle on dialogue, with a colourful larding of rural Ulster argot. The play climaxed in a double murder which, though it was camouflaged as a terrorist outrage, was the result of blackmailing land deals with a conniving Catholic solicitor from the other side of the \"ramparts\". </p> <p>Benighted rural sexuality and paramilitarism surface again in Crilly's new play. On McQuillan's Hill is another blackly comic melodrama about a newly released IRA prisoner who comes home, itching to find out why he was shot to ribbons by his former comrades. He's also gay, and happier to reunite with his Protestant boyfriend than with his long-lost sister, or his former IRA commanding officer. Cue a clatter of traumatic revelations involving incest, hidden parenthood and paramilitary betrayal. </p> <p>Once again, it's mounted by Belfast's Tinderbox, a new-writing company that originally staged both Gary Mitchell and Darragh Carville's work. \"Right from the start, we looked at it as a companion piece to Second Hand Thunder,\" says Crilly. \"That was about the Prods, and this one's about the Shinners [Sinn Fein supporters].\" </p> <p>Blunt as that may sound, it's hard to crowbar much more comment from him. \"I suppose my central theme is the innocence of the child, and the political and social responsibility to youth and all that mullarkey... And of course, the main thrust of any piece of theatre is to get a good yarn going, rather than getting bogged down in heavy ideology. I'd just like to think I've managed a good mixture between light and shade. In rural communities generally, life is much darker once you lift the covers off.\" </p> <p>Although Crilly has lived in London since he was 18 (\"half my life, near enough\"), he grew up in the rural area of Derrymacash beside Lough Neagh, and has never lost his self-deprecatory, Northern Irish affability - or indeed the accent, which occasionally relaxes into a lazy, sugary drawl. </p> <p>\"Yes, I'm a Loughshore boy. My grandparents on both sides were small rural farmers, but by the time it got to our generation, there was just the farmhouse. But it's less countrified than when I was a kid. The city has crawled to the town, and the town has crawled out into the country.\" </p> <p>The local town, Lurgan, was always a hot spot, and the spire of Drumcree church was visible from his front window. \"Our area is a patchwork of loyalties. The immediate area is pretty much Catholic, but there' are pockets of Protestant communities as well: good country Prods, fair-minded folk.\" </p> <p>But ask him about the local effects of the Troubles, and he becomes evasive. \"Sure, shit happened, shit went on. But my background is very much constitutional nationalism, you know - peace- loving and abhorring violence, like the vast_ well, I don't know if vast if the right word, but the majority, of people in Northern Ireland. In other words, we're a nation of moderates, which people often forget.\" </p> <p>Why does he give republicans such a hard time in the new play? \"I have no time for the militant tendency on either side,\" he says. \"In McQuillan's Hill, the militant republican tendency does get a bit of a rattle - but that's fine. They're sitting targets.\" </p> <p>The central character, Fra, is \"basically in the Provies because he isn't loved enough. And in my youth I was aware of young guys being in the IRA because it gave them some kind of credibility, a raison d' tre, without any real grasp of ideology or any view on a wider world.\" </p> <p>Of Fra's rather chillier IRA superior, Crilly says \"he's a dysfunctional character. It's a Vietnam vet thing: the war's over, and he's redundant to a degree. But I'm getting at how these guys work, the whole on-duty, off-duty thing - and it's not just a paramilitary thing, but a military thing as well. It's a double-edged morality, the way they can switch backwards and forwards between rectitude and complete depravity.\" </p> <p>He attributes his \"tight-lipped, Ulster, country reticence\" partly to the fact that his mum still lives in Derrymacash. \"Also, I don't want my plays to be part of that 'tales from the war zone' thing. Anyone who grew up here during all the bullshit was affected by it, but it informs people's lives rather than governs them. On a basic level, when writing about Northern Ireland, you have to include some reference to the turbulence. It creeps into every social situation, but it's a lot more complex than a lot of your plays from behind the barricades or your films about the Shankill Butchers.\" </p> <p>As an actor in London through the 80s, Crilly was often called upon \"whenever the TV companies thought it was a good idea to produce a Troubles drama. The joke among Northern Irish actors used to be 'Have balaclava, will travel', and very rarely would you come across something that you thought was delivering something positive or even plausible.\" </p> <p>He also consciously set out to \"resurrect aspects of the stage-Ulster tradition, with its farms and its Protestants and Catholics, but to use a much more realistic take on it, and I just love the humour in the language. Listening to neighbours, I'd be very conscious of speech patterns and rhythms. It's just very attractive to capture that in some shape or form.\" </p> <p>Although largely unexposed in mainland Britain, Crilly's work has some overlap with the wild-minded rural comedies of Martin McDonagh, with the Troubles as a risible backdrop to characters who are more haplessly tormented than psychotic. \"If I'm in sitting London trying to fine-hone my craft as a theatre writer, I'm not 'addressing Northern Ireland' in some tub-thumping ideological way. It has to be done from a different angle. </p> <p>\"Part of the thing about living away from Northern Ireland is that you go back to it anew, having once accepted it as normal. I left during the 1981 hunger strike; it was crazy. Over the years, you realise that because Northern Ireland is such a conundrum, people are sick to the fucking eye teeth of trying to fathom it. My partner's a Londoner and we've a 16-month-old kid now.\" </p> <p>The boy's called Redmond, no doubt with a nod to the moderate Irish Nationalist politician John Redmond. \"My partner's fine about the North, but she quite obviously feels that Northern Ireland isn't quite the place to bring up a kid. Not that it's an awful place, but there's so much complexity that you wouldn't want to foist on someone. Sure, there's a new generation and integrated schools, but all that old stuff's always there.\" </p> <p>Isn't that a damning reflection of his native land? \"My instinct is to present grim things with a humorous flourish,\" he counters. \"My gut feeling that people will out, adversity is temporary, and for all of the dark side, the last thing out of Pandora's box is hope_ Um, isn't it?\" </p> <p>He doesn't sound that certain. </p> <p>\u0095 On McQuillan's Hill is at the Lyric Theatre, Belfast (01232 381081), from Monday till February 26, then tours till April.

On McQuillan's Hill is another blackly comic melodrama about a newly released IRA prisoner who comes home, itching to find out why he was shot to ribbons by his former comrades. He's also gay, and happier to reunite with his Protestant boyfriend than with his long-lost sister, or his former IRA commanding officer. Cue a clatter of traumatic revelations involving incest, hidden parenthood and paramilitary betrayal. Once again, it's mounted by Belfast's Tinderbox, a new-writing company that originally staged both Gary Mitchell and Darragh Carville's work. \"Right from the start, we looked at it as a companion piece to Second Hand Thunder,\" says Crilly. \"That was about the Prods, and this one's about the Shinners [Sinn Fein supporters].\" Blunt as that may sound, it's hard to crowbar much more comment from him. \"I suppose my central theme is the innocence of the child, and the political and social responsibility to youth and all that mullarkey... And of course, the main thrust of any piece of theatre is to get a good yarn going, rather than getting bogged down in heavy ideology. I'd just like to think I've managed a good mixture between light and shade. In rural communities generally, life is much darker once you lift the covers off.\" Although Crilly has lived in London since he was 18 (\"half my life, near enough\"), he grew up in the rural area of Derrymacash beside Lough Neagh, and has never lost his self-deprecatory, Northern Irish affability - or indeed the accent, which occasionally relaxes into a lazy, sugary drawl. \"Yes, I'm a Loughshore boy. My grandparents on both sides were small rural farmers, but by the time it got to our generation, there was just the farmhouse. But it's less countrified than when I was a kid. The city has crawled to the town, and the town has crawled out into the country.\" The local town, Lurgan, was always a hot spot, and the spire of Drumcree church was visible from his front window. \"Our area is a patchwork of loyalties. The immediate area is pretty much Catholic, but there' are pockets of Protestant communities as well: good country Prods, fair-minded folk.\" But ask him about the local effects of the Troubles, and he becomes evasive. \"Sure, shit happened, shit went on. But my background is very much constitutional nationalism, you know - peace- loving and abhorring violence, like the vast_ well, I don't know if vast if the right word, but the majority, of people in Northern Ireland. In other words, we're a nation of moderates, which people often forget.\" Why does he give republicans such a hard time in the new play? \"I have no time for the militant tendency on either side,\" he says. \"In McQuillan's Hill, the militant republican tendency does get a bit of a rattle - but that's fine. They're sitting targets.\" The central character, Fra, is \"basically in the Provies because he isn't loved enough. And in my youth I was aware of young guys being in the IRA because it gave them some kind of credibility, a raison d' tre, without any real grasp of ideology or any view on a wider world.\" Of Fra's rather chillier IRA superior, Crilly says \"he's a dysfunctional character. It's a Vietnam vet thing: the war's over, and he's redundant to a degree. But I'm getting at how these guys work, the whole on-duty, off-duty thing - and it's not just a paramilitary thing, but a military thing as well. It's a double-edged morality, the way they can switch backwards and forwards between rectitude and complete depravity.\" He attributes his \"tight-lipped, Ulster, country reticence\" partly to the fact that his mum still lives in Derrymacash. \"Also, I don't want my plays to be part of that 'tales from the war zone' thing. Anyone who grew up here during all the bullshit was affected by it, but it informs people's lives rather than governs them. On a basic level, when writing about Northern Ireland, you have to include some reference to the turbulence. It creeps into every social situation, but it's a lot more complex than a lot of your plays from behind the barricades or your films about the Shankill Butchers.\" As an actor in London through the 80s, Crilly was often called upon \"whenever the TV companies thought it was a good idea to produce a Troubles drama. The joke among Northern Irish actors used to be 'Have balaclava, will travel', and very rarely would you come across something that you thought was delivering something positive or even plausible.\" He also consciously set out to \"resurrect aspects of the stage-Ulster tradition, with its farms and its Protestants and Catholics, but to use a much more realistic take on it, and I just love the humour in the language. Listening to neighbours, I'd be very conscious of speech patterns and rhythms. It's just very attractive to capture that in some shape or form.\" Although largely unexposed in mainland Britain, Crilly's work has some overlap with the wild-minded rural comedies of Martin McDonagh, with the Troubles as a risible backdrop to characters who are more haplessly tormented than psychotic. \"If I'm in sitting London trying to fine-hone my craft as a theatre writer, I'm not 'addressing Northern Ireland' in some tub-thumping ideological way. It has to be done from a different angle. \"Part of the thing about living away from Northern Ireland is that you go back to it anew, having once accepted it as normal. I left during the 1981 hunger strike; it was crazy. Over the years, you realise that because Northern Ireland is such a conundrum, people are sick to the fucking eye teeth of trying to fathom it. My partner's a Londoner and we've a 16-month-old kid now.\" The boy's called Redmond, no doubt with a nod to the moderate Irish Nationalist politician John Redmond. \"My partner's fine about the North, but she quite obviously feels that Northern Ireland isn't quite the place to bring up a kid. Not that it's an awful place, but there's so much complexity that you wouldn't want to foist on someone. Sure, there's a new generation and integrated schools, but all that old stuff's always there.\" Isn't that a damning reflection of his native land? \"My instinct is to present grim things with a humorous flourish,\" he counters. \"My gut feeling that people will out, adversity is temporary, and for all of the dark side, the last thing out of Pandora's box is hope_ Um, isn't it?\" He doesn't sound that certain. \u0095 On McQuillan's Hill is at the Lyric Theatre, Belfast (01232 381081), from Monday till February 26, then tours till April.

It is the first time since 1967 that the country's Chinese, or Tiong Hoa, community has been allowed to openly celebrate the lunar new year.</p> <p>Dragons have been dancing in shopping malls across the city, plays about Chinese culture are once again being performed, businesses selling Chinese festive goods are reporting brisk business and people are flocking to temples.</p> <p>\"Throughout the Suharto years public celebrations were banned because he forced us to assimilate into traditional Indonesian society,\" said Errnawati Sugondo, a senior member of the Indonesian Chinese Social Association. \"Now we are free to celebrate our culture again and people are very keen to do so.\"</p> <p>That is also because this year, 2551 in the Chinese calendar, is the year of the Golden Dragon, the most auspicious in the 60-year cycle.</p> <p>However, with the scars of the 1998 riots still visible all around, most people will not risk inciting more violence, particularly at a time when ethnic and religious tension between Christians and Muslims is engulfing the Spice islands. \"Yes there will be dragon dancing and some public shows,\" said Lau Xian Sing, a worker at the Dharma Bhakti temple in Chinatown. \"But I don't think it will be that big. People are still afraid.\"</p> <p>They have good reason to be. In a classic example of divide and rule, Mr Suharto used the Chinese to spearhead his furious economic development programme but so stigmatised them as rich and selfish that they became the scapegoat for all the country's ills.</p> <p>Not only were they victimised in riot after riot, numerous decrees were passed limiting their involvement in national life. The number of Chinese who could enter the civil service, universities and the military was limited, the use of Chinese characters was banned and people were \"strongly encouraged\" to take Indonesian names. Now these restrictions are slowly being lifted.</p> <p>All the major political parties have reached out to the Chinese and the president, Abdurrahman Wahid, has even admitted that he has some Chinese ancestry.</p> <p>\"Gus Dur [Mr Wahid] is being very clever,\" said Harry Tjan Silalahi, a political analyst. \"He is creating a personal link to the Chinese which will reduce people's hostility to them while making them feel more upbeat.\"</p> <p>Mr Wahid also appointed an ethnic Chinese, Kwik Kian Gie, as his senior economics minister and a Chinese tycoon, Sofyan Wanandi, as the chairman of his business development board. He also chose Beijing as the destination for his first state visit.</p> <p>However, 14 of the repressive decrees remain in force and with the country facing political turmoil and economic uncertainty, they are unlikely to be lifted soon.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In May 1998, as General Suharto's regime underwent its death throes, plumes of thick smoke blackened the sky above Jakarta's Chinatown for several says as mobs ran amok. Almost two years on, the air is once again full of smoke, this time coming from celebratory incense sticks. Today marks a milestone in Indonesia's transition to a democratic society. It is the first time since 1967 that the country's Chinese, or Tiong Hoa, community has been allowed to openly celebrate the lunar new year. Dragons have been dancing in shopping malls across the city, plays about Chinese culture are once again being performed, businesses selling Chinese festive goods are reporting brisk business and people are flocking to temples. \"Throughout the Suharto years public celebrations were banned because he forced us to assimilate into traditional Indonesian society,\" said Errnawati Sugondo, a senior member of the Indonesian Chinese Social Association. \"Now we are free to celebrate our culture again and people are very keen to do so.\" That is also because this year, 2551 in the Chinese calendar, is the year of the Golden Dragon, the most auspicious in the 60-year cycle. However, with the scars of the 1998 riots still visible all around, most people will not risk inciting more violence, particularly at a time when ethnic and religious tension between Christians and Muslims is engulfing the Spice islands. \"Yes there will be dragon dancing and some public shows,\" said Lau Xian Sing, a worker at the Dharma Bhakti temple in Chinatown. \"But I don't think it will be that big. People are still afraid.\" They have good reason to be. In a classic example of divide and rule, Mr Suharto used the Chinese to spearhead his furious economic development programme but so stigmatised them as rich and selfish that they became the scapegoat for all the country's ills. Not only were they victimised in riot after riot, numerous decrees were passed limiting their involvement in national life. The number of Chinese who could enter the civil service, universities and the military was limited, the use of Chinese characters was banned and people were \"strongly encouraged\" to take Indonesian names. Now these restrictions are slowly being lifted. All the major political parties have reached out to the Chinese and the president, Abdurrahman Wahid, has even admitted that he has some Chinese ancestry. \"Gus Dur [Mr Wahid] is being very clever,\" said Harry Tjan Silalahi, a political analyst. \"He is creating a personal link to the Chinese which will reduce people's hostility to them while making them feel more upbeat.\" Mr Wahid also appointed an ethnic Chinese, Kwik Kian Gie, as his senior economics minister and a Chinese tycoon, Sofyan Wanandi, as the chairman of his business development board. He also chose Beijing as the destination for his first state visit. However, 14 of the repressive decrees remain in force and with the country facing political turmoil and economic uncertainty, they are unlikely to be lifted soon.",

This time, at least, she will be talking to the hosts and hostesses of house parties to which a total of 24,000 supporters have been invited to watch her ritual announcement on television.</p> <p>\"People are really ready to hit the ground running with Hillary when she announces,\" said Judith Hope, chairwoman of New York state Democratic party. \"These parties will be a great way to harness the energy that surrounds Hillary's campaign.\" The polls suggest that, for Mrs Clinton's sake, this had better be true.</p> <p>Whatever she says to the people who answer her calls, she is unlikely to tell them why she is running. At the height of speculation eight months ago about her intentions, the president said he had advised his wife about her political future. \"You have to know, you need to know, why you want the job ... the most important thing is that you know why you want to serve,\" he told her.</p> <p>She must know but she has not been telling. Not during her summer-long \"listening tour\" of the state; not during the months of fundraisers and blunders that followed; and not during the past week when she has gone to ground to prepare the way for tomorrow's set-piece, leaving her staff to run a rapid-rebuttal operation against her certain opponent, the New York mayor, Rudolph Giuliani.</p> <p>At first the vacuum created by her failure to provide the reason was filled with the assumption that a seat in the senate would take her closer to the reward that her ambition and service in saving a tarnished president required - the oval office.

      "bodyText": "Five hundred people in homes around New York state will pick up the phone tomorrow to hear Hillary Clinton telling them what they have known for months: that she is running for the senate. The conference call will give her an opportunity to exercise the people skills that appear to have failed her so far in her campaign. This time, at least, she will be talking to the hosts and hostesses of house parties to which a total of 24,000 supporters have been invited to watch her ritual announcement on television. \"People are really ready to hit the ground running with Hillary when she announces,\" said Judith Hope, chairwoman of New York state Democratic party. \"These parties will be a great way to harness the energy that surrounds Hillary's campaign.\" The polls suggest that, for Mrs Clinton's sake, this had better be true. Whatever she says to the people who answer her calls, she is unlikely to tell them why she is running. At the height of speculation eight months ago about her intentions, the president said he had advised his wife about her political future. \"You have to know, you need to know, why you want the job ... the most important thing is that you know why you want to serve,\" he told her. She must know but she has not been telling. Not during her summer-long \"listening tour\" of the state; not during the months of fundraisers and blunders that followed; and not during the past week when she has gone to ground to prepare the way for tomorrow's set-piece, leaving her staff to run a rapid-rebuttal operation against her certain opponent, the New York mayor, Rudolph Giuliani. At first the vacuum created by her failure to provide the reason was filled with the assumption that a seat in the senate would take her closer to the reward that her ambition and service in saving a tarnished president required - the oval office. But that seems less plausible as she trails in the polls. After the high school bands and choirs have done their bit and she has said her piece at the state university's Purchase College tomorrow, Mrs Clinton will still be in a far weaker position than a year ago. Polls show that Mr Giuliani would win by 49% to 40% if the vote were tomorrow. When Mrs Clinton was 10 points ahead a year ago it was partly because of her popularity with women.

They are a minority, but that will not be much comfort. Logistical problems with third parties working on our behalf added to delays. All the packets have now been sent out, along with an apology.

We should have said \"without the routine prophylactic use of antibiotics or artificial pesticides\". Organic pesticides may be used. \u0095 Just so there is no misunderstanding (though our page 30 rugby story, February 3, reads clearly enough to us), pubs in the Twickenham area are open as usual today. It is bars at the ground that are closing before the England-Ireland match ends. \u0095: By popular demand here is the Real Rugeley Joke, after names were scrambled in an item on page 9, yesterday. It should have gone: Rugeley in Staffordshire petitioned to change its name in 1855 to escape associations with the Victorian poisoner William Palmer. The prime minister said this was fine as long as the town was renamed after him, Lord Palmerston. Rugeley had a rethink.",

The change is one of many being worked on by Alan McWalter, Marks &amp; Spencer's brands man - its first marketing director, hired from Woolworth. </p> <p>Details of the logo, which will adorn everything from shop fronts to carrier bags, are under wraps but a source close to the chain admits: \"It will be different but not radical.\" It will also be next year, if the ailing retailer survives long enough as an independent company to put its plans into action.

Now it must catch up, and fast. </p> <p>Many of Mr McWalter's colleagues from the world of brand building believe that the store has sunk so far, so fast, that the M&amp;S brief is now the marketing job from hell. \"It's a basket case,\" said one retail marketeer, who was approached about the job but says he refused to consider it. </p> <p><strong> Just plain naff</strong><br> </p> <p> McWalter begs to differ. By his reckoning it is just \"a challenge\", and one he is well equipped to handle. He is not even daunted about having to operate in the air-kissing world of fashion. \"There are issues to be addressed, just like any other business, and sound marketing to be applied\". </p> <p>He gushes about the brand - despite the battering it has taken in recent months and the fact that M&amp;S is now regarded, not as the home of affordable quality but as just plain naff. \"It is a magnificent asset. A world-renowned brand and we will keep it that way\". </p> <p>As the new boy and a marketing man, Mr McWalter cannot afford to appear downbeat. After just a month in the job criticism is tricky - as it would be a direct insult to many of his new, longstanding M&amp;S colleagues. He will concede only that \"the market has changed, the customer has changed and we failed to recognise that\". </p> <p>While the City welcomed the retailer's decision to haul itself into the modern world with the appointment of a brand specialist, they were almost universally underwhelmed when Mr McWalter was named. If M&amp;S had managed to pull in the marketing supremo from Tesco or Asda, they would have been impressed but instead their reaction was: \"Alan who?\". </p> <p>In fact Mr McWalter, 46, has a solid retail background. Leaving university with a science degree, he joined Unilever working on haircare products. In 1991, after spells working for Spillers thuen Thorn, he joined Kingfisher, first at Comet and then Woolworths. There he masterminded the \"Winter Wonderland\" promotion. That campaign was \"a phenomenal success\", and it was his Woolworths' experience \"which has equipped me for this job\". </p> <p>He describes himself as \"a big brand fan and big brand user\" and rates Mercedes, BMW, The Gap and Disney as those he most admires. \"They really mean something to people. They are things people aspire to\". They also have the status McWalter would like to see returned to M&amp;S. </p> <p>But analysts and investors who reckon the only way for M&amp;S to regain its prestige in UK retailing is to put established outside brand names on its shelves are likely to be disappointed. Such a move, he says, is not on the agenda, either for fashion or food. Instead he will concentrate on moving the M&amp;S name into new areas, like the mobile phones launched late last year to the prams and cots coming soon. </p> <p><strong> Inside customers' heads</strong><br> </p> <p> Last week, just five weeks into the job, he was touring M&amp;S's European operations. \"We have got to get inside our customers' heads,\" he says. He wants service levels improved and the first signs of that initiative came yesterday when the store announced 4,000 new shopfloor staff, made up of 1,000 new staff and 3,000 existing workers who are to be \"refocused\". </p> <p>At the same time he was overseeing a major change to M&amp;S's advertising strategy. The group has decided to hunt for a new agency to run a huge new image-building advertising campaign, with a rumoured budget of \u00a315m in the first year. </p> <p>It is another radical change for the retailer, which has previously employed one agency for clothing work, another for food and others for one-off projects. Now it wants one, big, creative mainstream agency to oversee the lot. It is likely to include a TV campaign - a route the retailer has largely spurned in the past, prefering to concentrate its resources on local promotions for new stores. Just before joining the Baker Street boys, Mr McWalter had a spot of gardening leave and used it to canvas opinion about where M&amp;S was going wrong. \"Every morning I took my children to school and talked to mothers -the best market research. They want to see the store back on its feet. They told me the ranges needed to be sorted out but what was coming through in spades was they thought M&amp;S was a fantastic store.\" </p> <p>But the evidence in the sales figures and the profit and loss account is that shoppers are no longer in love with St Michael. Or maybe it is just that the mums of Esher - one of Surrey's wealthiest enclaves and the place Mr McWalter calls home - are not M&amp;S's core customers any longer. </p> <p>The store, however, has some cunning plans to win dissaffected shoppers back - of all income groups. \"The middle market is getting very difficult. It is being squeezed from the top and the bottom and we are the key mid-market player\", said McWalter. \"So what we can do is take advantage of our scale, broaden our range to compete with both the bottom end of the market and the top, niche retailers.\" </p> <p><strong> Controversial decision</strong><br> </p> <p> In the stores that means a range of goods and prices unseen before. The controversial decision to source more goods from overseas means M&amp;S can cut costs and pass on the savings to shoppers. Prices were cut by an average of 5% last autumn and spring fashion ranges, unveiled to widespread acclaim on the fashion pages last week, will be another 5% down. </p> <p>The starting prices for key items have been slashed by larger amounts. A basic men's suit is down from \u00a3120 to \u00a399 this year and a ladies suit is \u00a375, compared to \u00a399 a year ago. </p> <p>At the other end of the scale M&amp;S is about to unveil new own-label designer ranges, put together by names including Betty Jackson, Julian MacDonald and Katherine Hamnett, which will be sold from specially constructed stores-within-stores. The range is to be previewed in fashion bible Vogue next week and \"it will be top tier pricing, higher than anything we've ever done before\", says McWalter. </p> <p>A pair of trousers from the designer range will be about \u00a370, compared to an average \u00a330 from the M&amp;S standard range and \u00a350 for its previously top-priced Italian collection. </p> <p>McWalter is also heading M&amp;S's e-commerce plans, but they are being put on the back burner until other more pressing matters are addressed. Giftwear and selected items from the spring ranges are available on the M&amp;S website, but there will be little more expansion for the time being. \"A key strength in exploiting e-commerce is the strength of the brand. So we must get the core offer right and only then can we export it to new channels like the web\". </p> <p>He admits any turnaround will be a long job. \"This is a big thing to take on. We have already seen some improvements but with a business of this scale it will take time.\"</p>",

At the same time he was overseeing a major change to M&amp;S's advertising strategy. The group has decided to hunt for a new agency to run a huge new image-building advertising campaign, with a rumoured budget of \u00a315m in the first year. It is another radical change for the retailer, which has previously employed one agency for clothing work, another for food and others for one-off projects. Now it wants one, big, creative mainstream agency to oversee the lot. It is likely to include a TV campaign - a route the retailer has largely spurned in the past, prefering to concentrate its resources on local promotions for new stores. Just before joining the Baker Street boys, Mr McWalter had a spot of gardening leave and used it to canvas opinion about where M&amp;S was going wrong. \"Every morning I took my children to school and talked to mothers -the best market research. They want to see the store back on its feet. They told me the ranges needed to be sorted out but what was coming through in spades was they thought M&amp;S was a fantastic store.\" But the evidence in the sales figures and the profit and loss account is that shoppers are no longer in love with St Michael. Or maybe it is just that the mums of Esher - one of Surrey's wealthiest enclaves and the place Mr McWalter calls home - are not M&amp;S's core customers any longer. The store, however, has some cunning plans to win dissaffected shoppers back - of all income groups. \"The middle market is getting very difficult. It is being squeezed from the top and the bottom and we are the key mid-market player\", said McWalter. \"So what we can do is take advantage of our scale, broaden our range to compete with both the bottom end of the market and the top, niche retailers.\" Controversial decision In the stores that means a range of goods and prices unseen before. The controversial decision to source more goods from overseas means M&amp;S can cut costs and pass on the savings to shoppers. Prices were cut by an average of 5% last autumn and spring fashion ranges, unveiled to widespread acclaim on the fashion pages last week, will be another 5% down. The starting prices for key items have been slashed by larger amounts. A basic men's suit is down from \u00a3120 to \u00a399 this year and a ladies suit is \u00a375, compared to \u00a399 a year ago. At the other end of the scale M&amp;S is about to unveil new own-label designer ranges, put together by names including Betty Jackson, Julian MacDonald and Katherine Hamnett, which will be sold from specially constructed stores-within-stores. The range is to be previewed in fashion bible Vogue next week and \"it will be top tier pricing, higher than anything we've ever done before\", says McWalter. A pair of trousers from the designer range will be about \u00a370, compared to an average \u00a330 from the M&amp;S standard range and \u00a350 for its previously top-priced Italian collection. McWalter is also heading M&amp;S's e-commerce plans, but they are being put on the back burner until other more pressing matters are addressed. Giftwear and selected items from the spring ranges are available on the M&amp;S website, but there will be little more expansion for the time being. \"A key strength in exploiting e-commerce is the strength of the brand. So we must get the core offer right and only then can we export it to new channels like the web\". He admits any turnaround will be a long job. \"This is a big thing to take on. We have already seen some improvements but with a business of this scale it will take time.\"",

His ability as a handyman is unrivalled and he spends much of his time arguing with a scarecrow named Spud. He is also very big business. </p> <p>Bob the Builder, a cartoon construction worker, has become a hero to a generation of pre-school children. </p> <p>His eponymous animated television series is shown in 66 countries and 14 languages. His website attracted 500,000 visitors in its first week. About 500,000 videos were shifted in the run-up to Christmas and there are now 120 Bob-branded merchandising products available in the shops. </p> <p>Over the past 18 months the City has woken up to the children's entertainment sector. In that time the share price of the series' producer, HIT, has risen from less than \u00a34 to \u00a322 before a recent five-for-one share split and now stands on an eye-watering price earnings rating of 150 times. </p> <p>Now HIT is attempting to use its shares to buy Britt Allcroft, owner of the Thomas the Tank Engine, Sooty and Captain Pugwash characters. Chorion, owner of Noddy, Winchester Entertainment, owner of the Jellabies, and the Just Group (Pinky and Perky) have all enjoyed good runs re cently. Just ask BBC Worldwide about the Teletubbies. </p> <p>HIT says that with Britt it would create the biggest producer of children's television outside the US with global export agreements and leverage ability rarely enjoyed by a British television company. </p> <p>Britt, named after the founder who mortgaged her house to finance the first Thomas series, is thought to be stalling at the moment and looking for a significant cash sweetener to an offer that would value it at about \u00a3224m. Disney and Flextech were rumoured to have expressed an interest but the whispers seem to be fading. </p> <p>In an age when digital television has caused a proliferation of channels, children's TV programmes have become premium assets, according to Celia Leaberry, an analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson. She says that, even before the rerating media stocks enjoyed in the wake of the recent AOL-Time Warner merger, companies like HIT and Britt offered content that could be leveraged in a way many other types of programming cannot. </p> <p>\"Their programmes do not carry any cultural baggage when they are dubbed,\" Ms Leaberry said. \"With drama it can be more of a problem. Thomas the Tank Engine is sold to 120 countries, broadcast in 11 languages and is one of the most popular licensed characters in Japan.\" </p> <p>Peter Orton, chief executive of HIT, says the unique appeal of children's TV is that it renews every three years. \"Old shows can be shown again and again.

      "bodyText": "He has a yellow hard hat, blue dungarees and his best friends are Scoop, Muck and Dizzy. His ability as a handyman is unrivalled and he spends much of his time arguing with a scarecrow named Spud. He is also very big business. Bob the Builder, a cartoon construction worker, has become a hero to a generation of pre-school children. His eponymous animated television series is shown in 66 countries and 14 languages. His website attracted 500,000 visitors in its first week. About 500,000 videos were shifted in the run-up to Christmas and there are now 120 Bob-branded merchandising products available in the shops. Over the past 18 months the City has woken up to the children's entertainment sector. In that time the share price of the series' producer, HIT, has risen from less than \u00a34 to \u00a322 before a recent five-for-one share split and now stands on an eye-watering price earnings rating of 150 times. Now HIT is attempting to use its shares to buy Britt Allcroft, owner of the Thomas the Tank Engine, Sooty and Captain Pugwash characters. Chorion, owner of Noddy, Winchester Entertainment, owner of the Jellabies, and the Just Group (Pinky and Perky) have all enjoyed good runs re cently. Just ask BBC Worldwide about the Teletubbies. HIT says that with Britt it would create the biggest producer of children's television outside the US with global export agreements and leverage ability rarely enjoyed by a British television company. Britt, named after the founder who mortgaged her house to finance the first Thomas series, is thought to be stalling at the moment and looking for a significant cash sweetener to an offer that would value it at about \u00a3224m. Disney and Flextech were rumoured to have expressed an interest but the whispers seem to be fading. In an age when digital television has caused a proliferation of channels, children's TV programmes have become premium assets, according to Celia Leaberry, an analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson. She says that, even before the rerating media stocks enjoyed in the wake of the recent AOL-Time Warner merger, companies like HIT and Britt offered content that could be leveraged in a way many other types of programming cannot. \"Their programmes do not carry any cultural baggage when they are dubbed,\" Ms Leaberry said. \"With drama it can be more of a problem. Thomas the Tank Engine is sold to 120 countries, broadcast in 11 languages and is one of the most popular licensed characters in Japan.\" Peter Orton, chief executive of HIT, says the unique appeal of children's TV is that it renews every three years. \"Old shows can be shown again and again. It keeps costs low.\" The US is the most important market, accounting for 27% of HIT's revenue. Bob and another popular HIT character, Kipper the Dog, are shown on Nickelodeon, the children's channel owned by Viacom, and HIT aims to strike similar deals for other characters. Programme makers are also excited about the potential of the internet as an educational medium. They say the interactivity of the net will allow characters like Bob to form the basis for learning programmes which young children are likely to find enjoyable and stimulating. But the real financial prize is in merchandising agreements. Merchandising sales account for 80% of Britt's revenues. Licensing News says the children's consumer products market in the US is worth $15bn. HIT has reached agreement with Mattell for a range of toys based on Angelina Ballerina, a tutu-wearing, dancing mouse. Angelina dolls will be pitched head to head with Barbie in the battle for the young girls market. Expect support from Bob, Spud, Muck and Dizzy soon.",

In the past five years Vivendi's communications arm has seen its revenues grow from \u20ac900m (\u00a3552m) to \u20ac3bn. One reason behind the growth is that Vivendi is the biggest shareholder in France's second-largest mobile phone company, C\u00e9g\u00e9tel, and its link-up with Vodafone will give it outright control, providing a platform for further expansion. But there is more to Vivendi than telecoms. It has a controlling stake in pay-TV group Canal Plus and has frightened Rupert Murdoch with a 24.5% stake in in BSkyB, a relationship which has attracted the attention of Britain's competition authorities. Through its Havas publishing arm Vivendi is also a leading player in the educational and entertainment software markets.

I suspect it is because the action effortlessly implies something far larger than itself. All that really happens is that Donny, the junkshop owner, enlists his young gofer, Bobby, in a coin- collection robbery: one that starts to go disastrously awry the moment Donny's hustling friend, Teach, ousts the boy and muscles in on the action. You might say, like the man in O'Casey, I see no magnificent meaning jumpin' out of that. </p> <p>But Mamet's skill lies precisely in the way the story acquires metaphorical resonance. Donny tells his young pupil early on that \"there's business and there's friendship\": a fatal schism that not only rebounds on Donny himself but pinpoints America's divorce of the capitalist ethic from social life. Even more tellingly, these petty hoods persuade themselves that they have some moral right to their victim's coin collection. </p> <p>Alongside this, Mamet hilariously harpoons the bull swagger and sexual fear of the American male. These guys talk big in order to disguise their panic, and no one more so than the interloping Teach. He starts off with a furious paranoid rant against two women in a coffee-shop that to me implies impotence. And, as the robbery gets closer, he comes out with phrases like \"You want depth on the team\", as if they were planning a raid on Fort Knox. The play goes wrong only when Teach is turned into a virtuosic star-turn: a trap that Neil Pepe's production and William H Macy's performance intelligently avoid. With his straight swept-back hair and thin moustache, Macy brilliantly shows Teach to be a nervy outsider who desperately wants to be part of the game. But he also brings out Teach's bullying vanity: almost his first action is to stare at himself in a compact and virtually his last is to shelter behind Donny when he interrogates the injured Bobby. </p> <p>Philip Baker Hall's grizzled Donny is good without quite conveying his final moral awakening but Mark Webber's Bobby has the right tremulous desire to please and Kevin Rigdon's set is an amazing collection of American bric-a-brac including, significantly, portraits of Lincoln and JFK.

      "body": "<p>It was when he started to secretly read a colleague's e-mails that Stuart Maynard, an advertising copywriter, realised he had a problem. \"John had been working in our team for about four months and I was finding it harder and harder to deal with,\" says Stuart. </p> <p>\"It sounds arrogant, but before John came on to the scene I know I was considered the best in the team - I got on really well with our team leader, we were always out for beers and I knew he thought very highly of me. When John joined, all that started to change.\" </p> <p>Feeling threatened by someone equally talented as himself, Stuart started to resent John's intrusion. \"He is an incredibly creative guy,\" says Stuart, \"and he got on with our boss brilliantly. Twice his ideas were taken over mine, everyone agreed they were really inventive. I felt like Woody to John's Buzz Lightyear - totally usurped.\" </p> <p>\"It can be hard if a new person joins and changes the structure of your office - particularly if you were doing well,\" says Professor Windy Dryden of Goldsmith's College. \"Jealousy or envy - if allowed to get out of control can be particularly destructive. The first thing to do when you start feeling this way is to decide whether your jealousy is situational or chronic - which means whether the situation really does exist, or if you are creating something that isn't really there.\" </p> <p>For Stuart, things were somewhere between the two. \"I got so obsessed with John that I started reading his e-mails so I could forestall him in meetings,\" he says. \"I was right in one way - things had changed - but where I was wrong was in thinking that my boss felt differently about me because he also liked John. In fact, he held us both in equally high esteem - but he had to take me out for lunch and tell me that - among other, slightly less positive things - before I started to get a grip.\" </p> <p>\"There are two ways to combat professional jealousy,\" believes Professor Dryden. \"One is to cultivate a more flexible attitude, the other is to build up your self-esteem. Office life is highly changeable - people come and go, workloads shift- and you need to be flexible to deal with that. Try not to rely too much on individuals - or place too much emphasis on one particular relationship - you need to be confident of your abilities on your own.\" </p> <p>\"I've always suffered from a lack of professional confidence,\" says Gina McFadyen, who works as a loans manager for a bank. \"I'm fine if I'm left to get on with things, but bad in an interactive situation. My job changed slightly a few months ago and there has been a lot more telephone work involved. I sit opposite a guy, Simon, who is just Mr Super-Charming on the phone and I'm so envious of him - I'm terrible on the phone- and I'm sure I look even less capable in comparison to him.\" </p> <p>\"Often envy or jealousy stems from some sort of resentment,\" says Nick Isles, spokesperson for the Institute of Personnel and Development. \"In many offices there is a total lack of communication - people end up doing tasks they're not particularly suited to, or have resentment at a lack of promotion - but don't feel they can talk to anyone about it. So, the jealousy builds and gets worse - and a situation that could have been dealt with easily early on, turns into a big problem.\" </p> <p>For Gina, a particularly bad afternoon meant she decided to take control of the situation. \"I'd just had enough - so I went to see my boss and told him I couldn't work in this new way. I expected him to tell me that I should be more like Simon, but in fact he said that I was a highly valued member of staff, that he respected me for coming to him and he would see what he could do. I felt about a billion times better - and just wish I had said something months ago.\" </p> <p> If you don't remember anything else, remember this ... </p> <p> Get control of your jealousy. If you don't, you'll start behaving in a way that will lose you the respect of your boss regardless of anyone else involved.

      "bodyText": "It was when he started to secretly read a colleague's e-mails that Stuart Maynard, an advertising copywriter, realised he had a problem. \"John had been working in our team for about four months and I was finding it harder and harder to deal with,\" says Stuart. \"It sounds arrogant, but before John came on to the scene I know I was considered the best in the team - I got on really well with our team leader, we were always out for beers and I knew he thought very highly of me. When John joined, all that started to change.\" Feeling threatened by someone equally talented as himself, Stuart started to resent John's intrusion. \"He is an incredibly creative guy,\" says Stuart, \"and he got on with our boss brilliantly. Twice his ideas were taken over mine, everyone agreed they were really inventive. I felt like Woody to John's Buzz Lightyear - totally usurped.\" \"It can be hard if a new person joins and changes the structure of your office - particularly if you were doing well,\" says Professor Windy Dryden of Goldsmith's College. \"Jealousy or envy - if allowed to get out of control can be particularly destructive. The first thing to do when you start feeling this way is to decide whether your jealousy is situational or chronic - which means whether the situation really does exist, or if you are creating something that isn't really there.\" For Stuart, things were somewhere between the two. \"I got so obsessed with John that I started reading his e-mails so I could forestall him in meetings,\" he says. \"I was right in one way - things had changed - but where I was wrong was in thinking that my boss felt differently about me because he also liked John. In fact, he held us both in equally high esteem - but he had to take me out for lunch and tell me that - among other, slightly less positive things - before I started to get a grip.\" \"There are two ways to combat professional jealousy,\" believes Professor Dryden. \"One is to cultivate a more flexible attitude, the other is to build up your self-esteem. Office life is highly changeable - people come and go, workloads shift- and you need to be flexible to deal with that. Try not to rely too much on individuals - or place too much emphasis on one particular relationship - you need to be confident of your abilities on your own.\" \"I've always suffered from a lack of professional confidence,\" says Gina McFadyen, who works as a loans manager for a bank. \"I'm fine if I'm left to get on with things, but bad in an interactive situation. My job changed slightly a few months ago and there has been a lot more telephone work involved. I sit opposite a guy, Simon, who is just Mr Super-Charming on the phone and I'm so envious of him - I'm terrible on the phone- and I'm sure I look even less capable in comparison to him.\" \"Often envy or jealousy stems from some sort of resentment,\" says Nick Isles, spokesperson for the Institute of Personnel and Development. \"In many offices there is a total lack of communication - people end up doing tasks they're not particularly suited to, or have resentment at a lack of promotion - but don't feel they can talk to anyone about it. So, the jealousy builds and gets worse - and a situation that could have been dealt with easily early on, turns into a big problem.\" For Gina, a particularly bad afternoon meant she decided to take control of the situation. \"I'd just had enough - so I went to see my boss and told him I couldn't work in this new way. I expected him to tell me that I should be more like Simon, but in fact he said that I was a highly valued member of staff, that he respected me for coming to him and he would see what he could do. I felt about a billion times better - and just wish I had said something months ago.\" If you don't remember anything else, remember this ... Get control of your jealousy. If you don't, you'll start behaving in a way that will lose you the respect of your boss regardless of anyone else involved. Write a list of your successes at work, be proud of your own achievements and try not to compare yourself with anyone else.",
