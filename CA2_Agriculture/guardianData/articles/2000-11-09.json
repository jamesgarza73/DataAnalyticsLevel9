PRs are often on call 24 hours a day, and while it can be rewarding to work for the NHS, pay lags behind the private sector. Junior press officers start on \u00a311,000 - \u00a314,000. A middle manager might earn \u00a320,000 - \u00a327,000 while a NHS trust head of PR could earn \u00a330,000-\u00a340,000. At the top pay is improving as communications is recognised as a key job within any NHS management team. Top communications staff at large NHS trusts can earn up to \u00a350,000; those with a seat on the board can earn \u00a360,000 plus. National institute of clinical excellence media director Anne-Toni Rodgers is on the board. So too is Matt Tee, director of communications at the commission for health improvement. McGowan believes that the likes of Rodgers and Tee are blazing a trail for the future of NHS communications. \"I think we have got to the point where the head of communications should have trust board director status,\" he says.",

The green paper also takes on board a number of the recommendations made in Lord Rogers' urban taskforce report.</p> <p><strong>How radical are the proposals? </strong><br> Not very. The government has not agreed to rearm councils with the power to set business rates, which was removed with the introduction of the poll tax. In fact, the green paper states that the current balance of funding between local and central sources of revenue does not need to change. This is a view that many in local government would dispute, arguing that local autonomy and accountability are reduced by the lack of discretion over funding at local level. The most radical proposal is to remove constraints on borrowing for capital projects, which could free up spending on transport, housing, libraries and other sectors. The government also proposes to allow councils to levy a supplementary business rate, after consultation with local businesses.</p> <p><strong> What about capital investment and borrowing? </strong><br> The green paper acknowledges that the present system of capital controls has constrained effective investment by local government. Under the proposals, local authorities will no longer need government approval for borrowing, although the government will keep reserve powers allowing it to intervene in exceptional circumstances. When considering borrowing, authorities will have to show the impact on revenue and establish their own ratios based on a set of centrally produced \"prudential indicators\", covering measures such as debt-to-revenue ratios. The regime will be underpinned by a requirement for councils to operate within balanced budgets. Councils will also have to consult their communities about investment plans.</p> <p><strong>Will central government grant distribution change? </strong><br> The paper acknowledges that the current standard spending assessment formula for distributing grants is too complex and rigid. It consults on a number of potential improvements. These include simplified formulas for all or part of grant distribution, specific grants to target resources and local public service agreements, which are to be piloted and which could lead to extra funds for those authorities that perform well against the standards of their agreement.</p> <p><strong>What about business rates?</strong><br> Councils will gain limited powers to set a supplementary rate, in consultation with local businesses, while the extra funds raised must be used in agreement with local companies. The supplementary rate could be used to fund town improvement schemes which were recommended in the urban taskforce report.</p> <p><strong>And council tax?</strong><br> The green paper proposes the introduction of a fixed revaluation cycle every six, eight or 10 years. In shire areas, where county councils account for 80% of the council tax bill but district councils send bills out, the government seeks views on whether county councils should take over responsibility for billing to improve accountability.</p> <p><strong>When could the green paper's proposals be introduced?</strong><br> Responses to the consultation are due by December 8. If the government is re-elected, the proposals could become law early in the next parliament. The paper says the earliest possible date for the introduction of changes to the revenue grant system would be 2003-04.</p>",

The government has not agreed to rearm councils with the power to set business rates, which was removed with the introduction of the poll tax. In fact, the green paper states that the current balance of funding between local and central sources of revenue does not need to change. This is a view that many in local government would dispute, arguing that local autonomy and accountability are reduced by the lack of discretion over funding at local level. The most radical proposal is to remove constraints on borrowing for capital projects, which could free up spending on transport, housing, libraries and other sectors. The government also proposes to allow councils to levy a supplementary business rate, after consultation with local businesses. What about capital investment and borrowing? The green paper acknowledges that the present system of capital controls has constrained effective investment by local government. Under the proposals, local authorities will no longer need government approval for borrowing, although the government will keep reserve powers allowing it to intervene in exceptional circumstances. When considering borrowing, authorities will have to show the impact on revenue and establish their own ratios based on a set of centrally produced \"prudential indicators\", covering measures such as debt-to-revenue ratios. The regime will be underpinned by a requirement for councils to operate within balanced budgets. Councils will also have to consult their communities about investment plans. Will central government grant distribution change? The paper acknowledges that the current standard spending assessment formula for distributing grants is too complex and rigid. It consults on a number of potential improvements. These include simplified formulas for all or part of grant distribution, specific grants to target resources and local public service agreements, which are to be piloted and which could lead to extra funds for those authorities that perform well against the standards of their agreement. What about business rates? Councils will gain limited powers to set a supplementary rate, in consultation with local businesses, while the extra funds raised must be used in agreement with local companies. The supplementary rate could be used to fund town improvement schemes which were recommended in the urban taskforce report. And council tax? The green paper proposes the introduction of a fixed revaluation cycle every six, eight or 10 years. In shire areas, where county councils account for 80% of the council tax bill but district councils send bills out, the government seeks views on whether county councils should take over responsibility for billing to improve accountability. When could the green paper's proposals be introduced? Responses to the consultation are due by December 8. If the government is re-elected, the proposals could become law early in the next parliament. The paper says the earliest possible date for the introduction of changes to the revenue grant system would be 2003-04.",

Each department or directorate general (DG) has responsibility for a specific policy area and is headed by a commissioner. To lobby effectively, you need to identify the DG dealing with your policy area and the relevant officials within that DG.

Working with an intergroup can be an effective way to raise the profile of your issues. MEPs have much easier access to official documents than voluntary organisations and can often be persuaded to intervene with commission officials on specific issues. Commissioners attend a Question Time session so, just as at Westminster, a parliamentary question can be an effective way to raise an issue.

The Equal Pay Act has been in force for 25 years in December 2000, but womens' pay in the public sector still falls well short of equality. The latest figures, drawn from 1999, shows public sector women still earning only 81.7% of the salary of their male colleagues.

      "bodyText": "A conclusive answer to who will be the next US president looks unlikely to emerge imminently, even though the crucial recount in Florida, where the vote is on a knife edge, is expected to finish today. Delays of days, or even weeks, on a clear outcome look increasingly likely with the Democrats alleging serious irregularities with the layout of the voting paper in some counties in Florida. Within Florida, Al Gore has trimmed 843 votes off George W Bush's lead, thanks to disputed results coming in from Palm Beach County. Mr Gore, the vice president, gained 1,189 votes from Palm Beach County, compared with 346 votes gained for Mr Bush. With 32 of the state's 67 counties finishing their recounts on Wednesday, that meant Mr Gore cut Mr Bush's lead by more than half, leaving the vice president just 941 votes behind the Texas governor. The recount in Florida was expected to finish by the end of the day, but, if it is very tight, there could be a delay of days while postal votes are accounted for. Whoever, wins in Florida would gain 25 electoral college votes - enough to be declared president. However, William Daley, Mr Gore's campaign chairman, today called for four disrict counties in Florida to be hand counted. \"Technicalities should not determine the president of the United States, the will of the people should,\" Mr Daley said in Florida, where some voters say that confusing ballots may have led them to vote for Pat Buchanan when they meant to support the vice president. Mr Daley said that the 19,120 votes in Palm Beach County which have been ruled invalid for being punched twice, amounted to a \"disenfranchisement\". \"We've come to believe that there are serious and substantial irregularities resulting from the ballot used only in one county,\" added the former secretary of state, Warren Christopher, dispatched to Florida to protect the Gore campaign's interests. Mr Daley said they were not trying to hold up the process but attacked the Bush camp for \"blithely dismissing the disenfranchisement as being the usual type of mistake made in elections\". In his short statement yesterday, Mr Gore did not say that he would accept the result of the Florida recount and there is a possibility that he may mount a supreme court challenge if the White House is awarded to Mr Bush. The recount in Florida was triggered by state law because Mr Bush led Mr Gore by less than one-half of 1%. Allegations of voting improprieties surfaced late on Tuesday and continued yesterday, ranging from missing and confusing ballots to problems with tabulations and voter intimidation. \"If there are concerns, let the process work,\" said Jeb Bush, governor of Flordida and the younger brother of the Republican nominee. \"But don''t over exaggerate things.\" Throughout the state, Democrats and some voters complained of irregularities in the election. In Palm Beach and Osceola counties, Democratic party lawyers and voters said that ballots were confusing because of their configuration. Officials in Palm Beach earlier announced that 19,120 ballots in the presidential race were tossed out before they were counted because more than one candidate was picked. Only 3,783 voters made that mistake on the US Senate portion of the ballot. \"That total is a high number,\" said Palm Beach County Commissioner Carol Roberts, who is part of the canvassing board that is conducting the recount. In Miami-Dade, Broward, and other counties, the Gore campaign complained about delays in the delivery of ballot boxes to counting places. Democrats set up a toll-free number where Florida voters could report irregularities. Mr Daley said they would support voters making legal moves to address the \"disenfranchisement\". Civil rights activists Jesse Jackson and Kweisi Mfume, the president of the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People, said that they received complaints that blacks had difficulty voting. They said that some voters were told that there were no more ballots, or that polls were closed. Jeb Bush said that he has seen no indications of fraud. But Mr Mfume called for federal marshals to oversee the ballot recount and asked the US justice department to investigate. The latest Florida totals before the recount, including all absentee ballots that had been received, showed Mr Bush with 2,909,135 votes and Gore with 2,907,351 - a difference of 1,784 in a state with 8.75m registered voters. Even as the recount proceeded, elections supervisors waited for the undetermined number of overseas ballots, primarily from military personnel and their families. The state counted about 2,300 overseas ballots in the 1996 presidential election and allows 10 days to count them, as long as they are postmarked no later than election day. Because of his vested interest in the outcome, the Florida governor removed himself from the panel that will certify results of the recount. The other members of the panel - the secretary of state, Katherine Harris, and state elections director Clay Roberts - are also Republicans. But the state's top Democratic official, the attorney general, Bob Butterworth, expressed confidence that the recount will be fair. \"All of us recognize the importance that every vote is correctly counted,\" Mr Butterworth said. \"I can also assure the rest of the nation that there's no way governor Jeb Bush or secretary of state Harris would certify election results ... if they had any doubt at all that the election was not in perfect order.\" Democratic Party officials and hundreds of voters complained about the way ballots in Palm Beach County were arranged. Voters punched holes in the middle of the ballot, while candidates were alternately listed to the left and then the right. \"It was virtually impossible to know who you voted for,\" said Mark Hirsch, a 30-year-old business executive who voted for Green party candidate Ralph Nader. Some Gore supporters in Palm Beach County said they feared that they mistakenly voted for Reform party candidate Pat Buchanan. Mr Gore carried the county by more than 110,000 votes, but the 3,407 votes for Buchanan were by far the most of any Florida county, and almost 20% of his total vote in the state. However, Republicans noted that the ballot was approved by Democrat Theresa LePore, the county supervisor of elections.

The county is training residents in the basics of consumer law, turning them into watchdogs with direct lines to trading standards officers. The association also highlights a Durham county council scheme that involves local communities in a wide partnership backed by funding from the Millennium Commission that is designed to regenerate the area's coastline.</p> <p>The government is beginning to provide powers to promote community leadership.

A bill to take forward the NHS plan could increase the role councils have in scrutinising the health service, and if the government decides on a housing bill, it may emphasise the role of authorities in ensuring that local housing needs are met.</p> <p>Ministers have not, however, defined what they want from community leading councils, hoping that local government can develop its own definitions. This leaves authorities in a double bind, in which the government may give strategic powers with one hand and take away high-spending services with the other. </p> <p>The comprehensive spending review, NHS plan and local government finance green paper may not have been as apocalyptic as some feared, but they did set out plans for the separate identification of school and local education authority budgets and raise the possibility that social services could be transferred into new care trusts. If councils are to fend off a creeping erosion of their powers, they must grab and lead the debate over community leadership.</p>",

Frontline first funding, as it is called, only ever existed as a series of leaks to the national and trade press, probably handed out by officials at the Department for Education and the Department of Health. But that was enough to keep councils holding their breath for more than six months, as they wondered whether the axe would fall during this summer's slew of policy announcements. In the event, the comprehensive spending review, local government finance green paper and NHS national plan did not dismember councils, but the anxiety they created is a sign of just how nervous local government has become about its future. There is widespread agreement that councils need to reassess what they do and take on a new role as community leaders.

While it has always fought to defend the role of the council in service delivery, it argues that service provision is just one way to achieve the right outcomes. \"Community leadership involves councils working in partnership with local people and organisations to develop a shared vision for the future for their locality, identifying immediate priorities for action and then working together to make a difference in local communities,\" says chairman Sir Jeremy Beecham. The LGA cites a Devon county council scheme as an example of good practice. The county is training residents in the basics of consumer law, turning them into watchdogs with direct lines to trading standards officers. The association also highlights a Durham county council scheme that involves local communities in a wide partnership backed by funding from the Millennium Commission that is designed to regenerate the area's coastline. The government is beginning to provide powers to promote community leadership. Its recently passed Local Government Act hands councils a power to promote the social, environmental and economic well-being of communities. This is in effect a legal framework that allows authorities limited freedom to do anything not prohibited by law. Legislation expected in the Queen's Speech could add further powers. A bill to take forward the NHS plan could increase the role councils have in scrutinising the health service, and if the government decides on a housing bill, it may emphasise the role of authorities in ensuring that local housing needs are met. Ministers have not, however, defined what they want from community leading councils, hoping that local government can develop its own definitions. This leaves authorities in a double bind, in which the government may give strategic powers with one hand and take away high-spending services with the other. The comprehensive spending review, NHS plan and local government finance green paper may not have been as apocalyptic as some feared, but they did set out plans for the separate identification of school and local education authority budgets and raise the possibility that social services could be transferred into new care trusts. If councils are to fend off a creeping erosion of their powers, they must grab and lead the debate over community leadership.",

Chatto, 388 pp., \u00a325, 6 July, 0 701 16931 1</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,xxx,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>Isherwood was a novelist with the inclinations of an autobiographer. There are always characters in his novels who love what he calls 'playacting', who charm and flirt and reinvent themselves whenever necessary, and as much as possible. They are such compelling and irreverent storytellers that they help us forget about truth-telling; they make everyone, including themselves, feel that it would be earnest and silly to start worrying again about honesty and good behaviour. But they keep coming up against more sincere, serious, passionate types who they are rather troubled by; or, as Isherwood sometimes intimates, who they are not troubled enough by. What makes him more of an experimental writer than he at first seems is that he treats this drama of the opportune and the principled, of the amused and the committed, very self-consciously - as a question of form. So autobiography is a problem in his novels, akin to a conscience. It tempers self-invention with other considerations; and the temptations in story-telling - what he called \"the difficulty of being frank without being indiscreet\", the eagerness to tell things for effect - become dramas in themselves. The embarrassment of the narrators in his fiction interests him as much as their confidence or their fluency. What is wonderful about Isherwood is that he wants, if possible, to be delighted by himself.</p> <p>At the same time there is outrage in his autobiographical writing - of which the Diaries and now Lost Years are fascinating evidence - about having to be embarrassed about anything. The unusual thing about Isherwood as an autobiographer is that he is never impressed by shame. He doesn't assume that being ashamed of ourselves in public is the best kind of truth-telling. Because he knows so much about charm (and its discontents) - because he is so attentive to the ways in which people go around impressing each other and themselves - he never goes in for the brash boastfulness of modern self-disclosure. His writing, in other words, is an experiment in non-confessional honesty; and Lost Years is an intriguing document of a work in progress. In the later autobiographical writings his project was, I think, to write truthfully about himself without feeling that he was submitting to anything (or anyone) by doing so. And on occasion this involved a kind of camp bravado, a sense of being scandalised at there being anything to be scandalised about. But he is never a portentous writer, just an eccentrically curious one, for whom all forms of special pleading, including his own - and Lost Years is, among other things, a portrait of the artist as special pleader - are merely refusals to play the game. He has, that is to say, the sulker's inside knowledge about the vanity of sulking. \"Christopher,\" he writes, looking back at himself in the third person (and almost as a third party),</p> <p>\"had always been a model employee. He despised amateurs like Brecht who, when they condescended to work at a film studio, whined and sneered and called themselves whores or slaves. Christopher prided himself on his adaptability. Writing a movie was a game, and each game had a different set of rules. Having learned the rules, Christopher could play along with enjoyment.\"</p> <p>Yet as Isherwood and the Christopher of Lost Years know, it is not always clear whether learning the rules is a matter of competence or compliance - part of the pleasure of mastery is the submission it entails. As Christopher learns the game of writing for the movies in Hollywood, and learns to write his own kind of fiction, and learns, above all, to play out his sexuality, he is also trying to invent his own game, to discover his very own rules whatever people might call him as a consequence. \"Wystan was much more mature than Christopher,\" he writes in Christopher and His Kind. \"Labels didn't scare him.\" This is a subtle definition of maturity because it knows so much about intimidation. A lot of Isherwood's characters find themselves jousting at labels. In Lost Years, written between the rather dour memoir of his parents, Kathleen and Frank (completed in 1970), and his great book Christopher and His Kind (published in 1976), Isherwood attempts a stark reconstruction of his early years in California. He is writing in the 1970s about his experience in the late 1940s of being, among other things, a gay man and an aspiring writer. And so he is remembering the old labels in the light of the new ones. And he is writing a memoir that is neither a diary nor a deliberately fictionalised autobiography. Lost Years, Katherine Bucknell tells us in her useful introduction, is part of \"a major new phase - roughly the final third of his career - in which Isherwood moved away from semi-fictionalised writing towards pure autobiography\". 'Pure autobiography' is obviously an odd phrase; and Lost Years is more about what, if anything, such a phrase might mean.</p> <p>Wondering what to write next after finishing Kathleen and Frank - having done his parents, so to speak - Isherwood considered writing a book about his spiritual teacher, Swami Prabhavananda, an adult he had been able to take rather more seriously as a guide to living his life. But it was clear to him, as he noted in his diary at the time, that it would be about the fact that his \"personal approach to Vedanta was, among other things, the approach of a homosexual looking for a religion which will accept him\". So instead of the book he would eventually write as My Guru and His Disciple (1980), Isherwood decided that he would write, largely for himself, a kind of 'reconstructed diary' about his sexual life in those apparently lost years in America. It would be, he wrote, \"quite largely a sexual record and so indiscreet as to be unpublishable. It might keep me amused, like knitting, but I should be getting on with something else.\" It was not clear exactly what a sexual record might be a record of. Or what kind of person the narrator as the recorder of these experiences would turn out to be. As a schoolboy Isherwood had written an essay entitled Omission Is the Beginning of All Art. Lost Years was to be a book in a wholly reputable modern genre: a book about what would otherwise be omitted. But written, at least in the first instance, only for the author. \"Isherwood's 'knitting',\" Bucknell remarks, \"somewhat like the flow of unselfconscious, free-associative talk in psychoanalysis, evidently set his mind free to delve more directly than ever before into his private life. The very insignificance and confidentiality of the task opened new avenues to self-reflection.\" For a writer so fascinated by the performing self to narrow down the audience in this way - to discover what kind of audience he was (or gave) to himself - might well have seemed like a necessary experiment. Isherwood is always at his best when he is showing us how self-consciousness tends to turn up at precisely those moments when we least expect it. Indeed, that we may be most archly self-conscious when we are apparently most forgetful of ourselves. It was his fear that self-consciousness went all the way down - that unselfconsciousness is something we enact, like everything else - that drew Isherwood to eastern religion, and to writing. The knitting of Lost Years stages a more direct delving into the self. And it is as an enquiry - or even as a draft of an enquiry - into the art of self-exposure that it should be read.</p> <p>When it came to writing, self-consciousness for Isherwood meant that there was pressure to be seen to be something - to be someone in particular, a certain kind of character - in one's description of things. So he would be disconcerted when anything interrupted the preferred performances of his writing self. He observed in his diary around the time he was writing Lost Years:</p> <p>\"The main thing I have to offer as a writer are my reactions to experience (these ARE my fiction or my poetry, or whatever you want to call it). Now, these reactions are more positive when I am reacting to actual experiences, than when I am reacting to imagined experiences. Yet, the actuality of the experiences does bother me, the brute facts keep tripping me up, I keep wanting to rearrange and alter the facts so as to relate them more dramatically to my reactions.\"</p> <p>To be a certain kind of writer, you need certain kinds of fact to react to. Altered or rearranged facts bring out the best in Isherwood. There has to be something out there to react to, but it mustn't be too much of an obstacle. Lost Years is an experiment in trying to write (at least a bit) against the grain: he will record the brute facts unaltered, without tripping up.</p> <p>Isherwood starts from the assumption, or rather tries out the idea, that a 'sexual record' of this period of his life suits the brute facts approach. Or at least that brute facts are required in any account of sexual life that isn't pointlessly disingenuous. So the fact that several reviewers of this book have tripped up on some of its brute facts - the unsanctimonious sex, the occasional anti-semitism, the bits of spite - is not entirely surprising. It is not news that we are not as nice as we should be (though what we make of this is sometimes news). But Isherwood is not trying to shock himself: he is seeing what happens - how the sentences come out - when he aims not to rearrange the facts. Not the self stripped of its adjectives, but a documentary about a performing self. \"I am writing this,\" Isherwood begins, \"to clarify my project to myself, not actually to begin work on it . . . Because the 'I' of this period is twenty years out of date, I shall write about him in the third person . . . this helps me to overcome my inhibitions, avoid self-excuses and regard my past behaviour more objectively.\" That inhibition and self-excuse more or less sum up the modern sense of self, that the modern, literary 'I' is always felt to be elsewhere out of date, in the third person, wishing for objectivity etc, is not a mission statement for Isherwood: it is simply the precondition for writing this particular book. The persistent modern project of trying to set the sexual record straight, and not so straight, has to be about the relationship between inhibition and self-excuse.</p> <p>It is, of course, easier to talk about inhibition and self-excuse - about one's ideal self and one's alibis - if one talks about the unconscious. But for Isherwood this is part of the problem rather than any kind of solution:</p> <p>\"Christopher had - and I still have - a deep-seated reluctance to try tinkering with his own psychological mechanism . . . Nowadays, I would say I believe that the unconscious must by its nature remain unconscious. It doesn't belong to me . . . All attempts to meddle with it are therefore attempts to impose my will and my ideas of what is good for me upon the infinitely greater wisdom of the non-self.\"</p> <p>Lost Years is acutely conscious of the way Christopher imposes his will and idea on others (\"Christopher, that shameless flatterer\"). But in writing this particular book he is much more attentive to the ways in which he imposes his will and his ideas on himself. As he reconstructs his past he describes his earlier self as virtually obsessed by self-characterisation; and then, every so often, as strangely guilty as he catches himself in the act. Isherwood quotes a \"coldly contemptuous\" remark about himself from Keith Vaughan's Journal and Drawings in which Vaughan describes Christopher as \"enormously interested in the superficialities of life\". And it is as though by quoting this he is reminding himself of something, trying not to keep certain questions about himself at bay. Because if Lost Years is perplexed about anything it is about what the superficialities of life are and about the things one finds enormously interesting, as opposed to all those things one is supposed to find of such moment. When he writes, for example, of The Unquiet Grave that it is Cyril Connolly's \"most maddening and snobbish book, and for that very reason his most fascinating and self-revealing\", he is remarking that the self is not revealed in its most (obviously) self-revealing places. What Christopher is enormously interested in in Lost Years is sex and, in a rather different sense, in what goes on between people. But he is uncertain - and this is part of the book's subtle amusement - what, if anything, his sexuality reveals about himself.</p> <p>As a \"confirmed self-preserver\" who \"in his inmost heart . . . thought of himself as an art-aristocrat or brahmin, a person privileged by his talent to demand the service (he preferred to call it 'the co-operation') of others\", Christopher is, as he notices, fairly well preserved from being too drastically changed by experience. Lost Years recreates a Christopher poised between a quest (and therefore the acknowledgment of some discontent) and a sense that the quest - which takes a more or less religious form - may itself be a distraction, that what Christopher most wants to be is what he already is: gay and a writer of considerable ambition and talent. It is a choice - though Isherwood does not present it in these terms - between the unmaking of the (familiar) self and making the self up, between a disciplined anonymity and being a character.</p> <p>In so far as Lost Years tells a story - it is, of course, integral to Isherwood's project that the book is unplotted, just strung-together anecdotes about what he remembers doing - it is about Isherwood's sexual preferences beginning to come adrift from his spiritual commitments. Not wishing to \"fool everyone into thinking him a saint\", Isherwood leaves the Vedanta Center, the religious community that had been his home, with a clear sense, at least in retrospect, of what he was up to:</p> <p>\"Should he have left the Center much sooner than he did? Looking back, I find that I can't say yes. It now seems to me that Christopher's embarrassment and guilt feelings were of little importance and his 'spiritual struggles' trivial. What mattered was that he was getting exposure to Swami, that his relations with Swami continued to be (fairly) frank, and that he never ceased to be aware of Swami's love. That he kept slipping away to see Bill Harris wasn't really so dreadful.\"</p> <p>What Isherwood catches so well here - and throughout the book - is the self-importance of the present moment; the possibility that our immersion in our lives as we live them - our 'spiritual struggles' - is an inevitable distraction from many points of view. If it is only in retrospect that we can avoid being so narrow-minded about ourselves, even see that narrow-minded is just what we have been, then recollection, Isherwood intimates, may be the best cure for egotism. What was once a melodrama of moral absolutes becomes a world in which being '(fairly) frank' is fair enough. We may look better if we rearrange the facts, but rearranging the facts is also moral propaganda. Christopher did feel guilt, embarrassment, dread, spiritual struggle then: what Isherwood now sees is an intense sexual and spiritual pragmatism at work. Christopher, he now recognises, boasted of his suffering as a cover-story for his real preferences. Lost Years is exhilarating because it is Isherwood's attempt to discover what mattered: not why it mattered to him, but that it mattered. And what is so artful about the writing in this book is that Isherwood's explanations of his own behaviour sound simply like descriptions. It is as though he is saying: this is what Christopher was like, but with none of the usual moral invitations to the reader. Modern self-disclosure is always a provocation: it asks us to assess the self, to judge if we dare. Lost Years is more like autobiography as natural history. If there is no point in talking about what a mollusc should be like, why describe what a person should be like?</p> <p>But erotic life is a big problem for natural history. The main drama of Lost Years is the young Isherwood's love affair with a man called Caskey, and the various sexual affairs and encounters that go on around it. What is most striking about the way Isherwood, in being as fairly frank and straightforward as possible, describes their differences is that they sound like perfect opposites. By refusing to be 'novelistic' the characters seem to revert to allegorical type. Christopher appears to be eminently sensible (even about his promiscuity), while Caskey \"didn't want his life to be predictable . . . He would tidy the house one day, and drunkenly wreck it the next.\" Isherwood's account of their relationship is also, unwittingly perhaps, a formulation of a dilemma about writing.</p> <p>\"Christopher's reasonableness, the justice of his case, the moderation of his demands upon Caskey were a bit TOO convincing - and he knew it. Relations between two human beings who are supposed to love each other - and perhaps actually do, from time to time - cannot be regulated by a code of rules. The truth is that Christopher was no more reasonable than Caskey; he merely had a knack of manoeuvring himself into positions in which he was, technically, 'in the right' - whereupon Caskey, with his passive obstinacy, would not only accept the counterposition of being 'in the wrong' but would proceed to make the wrong as wrong as he possibly could. He always behaved worst when there was no conceivable excuse for his behaviour. That was his kind of integrity.\"</p> <p>In Isherwood's view Christopher is often up to his old tricks; and Christopher's trick is in any given situation to privilege his own position. (By the same token, much of Isherwood's fiction is a critique of the self-justifying voice). Christopher has the knack of being very impressed by himself; and Lost Years is heartening because Isherwood is more than willing to be charmed by this, and also to enjoy seeing through it (ruthless unmasking would be just another knack of the self-important). To suggest that there were two kinds of integrity in play here, and not merely two wilful egotisms, is to suggest that integrity comes in a variety of forms, and that one of its functions is violent defensiveness. It is as though in writing Lost Years Isherwood was thinking about how to be as unself-protective a writer as possible without losing his sense of humour or, indeed, his pleasure as a novelist in people's self-protectiveness, their flair for self-assurance. He has a great eye for vanity because his suspicion of it is part of his relish for it.</p> <p>Isherwood wrote Lost Years in a spirit of generous suspicion about his younger self. Though there are sudden (and shocking) moments of self-loathing in the book, he is not keen to be lured into the refuge of self-criticism. As though to take against his former self would be a tactless self-betrayal. \"I have no right to sneer at Christopher's soul-searchings,\" he writes in parenthesis, \"just because they were conducted amidst bottles and boys - but they do embarrass me.\" That one's former self has rights, that there should be no privileged position from which to judge one's future or ex-selves, doesn't prevent embarrassment, or the regret at feeling it. That one could (or should) feel embarrassed about one's embarrassment - that shame might be trivial (to use one of Isherwood's key words) in the larger scale of things - is the version of moral progress that Isherwood was after.

It was as a human being that Forster awed him. Forster demanded truth in all his relationships; underneath his charming unalarming exterior he was a stern moralist and his mild babylike eyes looked deep into you.

The truthfulness that makes Christopher feel 'false and tricky'; and the comedy act he uses to manage his unease is where Christopher - and in a different sense, where Isherwood as a writer - is most interestingly poised. Forster's demand for truth is, in Isherwood's canny way, treated as sceptically as Christopher's performing self. As though Isherwood knows that the fool is not less trustworthy than his master.

To be false and tricky and to sparkle under certain kinds of pressure is as much part of Christopher's truthfulness as being a morally insidious baby is part of Forster's truthfulness. Isherwood as a writer wants to resist the lure of morally privileged positions, while acknowledging the interest of their power. If Christopher had become a stern and alarming moralist in Forster's presence his own truth could not have been told. In other words, what Forster's moral pressure made Christopher feel and do interests Isherwood as much as, if not more than, Forster's principles. To have been more serious with Forster would have been a self-betrayal; and, not incidentally, it would have deprived Forster of his obvious pleasure in Isherwood's company. The master is glum and self-obsessed without his fool.</p> <p>\"And yet,\" Isherwood writes towards the end of this compelling memoir, \"Christopher WAS open to interference - by the right person.\" 'Interference' is the right word for those, like Christopher, who are so set in their ways; who underneath all the reckless mischief and spiritual struggle, are going their own way. You never feel, reading Lost Years, that Christopher won't come through, because he keeps coming across the right person. And he knows that there are plenty of them. And that they are going to be right for different reasons and for different things.</p> <p>\u0095 To read more online essays from the current edition of the London Review of Books visit the <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/\">LRB</a>.

Chatto, 388 pp., \u00a325, 6 July, 0 701 16931 1 Buy it at BOL Isherwood was a novelist with the inclinations of an autobiographer. There are always characters in his novels who love what he calls 'playacting', who charm and flirt and reinvent themselves whenever necessary, and as much as possible. They are such compelling and irreverent storytellers that they help us forget about truth-telling; they make everyone, including themselves, feel that it would be earnest and silly to start worrying again about honesty and good behaviour. But they keep coming up against more sincere, serious, passionate types who they are rather troubled by; or, as Isherwood sometimes intimates, who they are not troubled enough by. What makes him more of an experimental writer than he at first seems is that he treats this drama of the opportune and the principled, of the amused and the committed, very self-consciously - as a question of form. So autobiography is a problem in his novels, akin to a conscience. It tempers self-invention with other considerations; and the temptations in story-telling - what he called \"the difficulty of being frank without being indiscreet\", the eagerness to tell things for effect - become dramas in themselves. The embarrassment of the narrators in his fiction interests him as much as their confidence or their fluency. What is wonderful about Isherwood is that he wants, if possible, to be delighted by himself. At the same time there is outrage in his autobiographical writing - of which the Diaries and now Lost Years are fascinating evidence - about having to be embarrassed about anything. The unusual thing about Isherwood as an autobiographer is that he is never impressed by shame. He doesn't assume that being ashamed of ourselves in public is the best kind of truth-telling. Because he knows so much about charm (and its discontents) - because he is so attentive to the ways in which people go around impressing each other and themselves - he never goes in for the brash boastfulness of modern self-disclosure. His writing, in other words, is an experiment in non-confessional honesty; and Lost Years is an intriguing document of a work in progress. In the later autobiographical writings his project was, I think, to write truthfully about himself without feeling that he was submitting to anything (or anyone) by doing so. And on occasion this involved a kind of camp bravado, a sense of being scandalised at there being anything to be scandalised about. But he is never a portentous writer, just an eccentrically curious one, for whom all forms of special pleading, including his own - and Lost Years is, among other things, a portrait of the artist as special pleader - are merely refusals to play the game. He has, that is to say, the sulker's inside knowledge about the vanity of sulking. \"Christopher,\" he writes, looking back at himself in the third person (and almost as a third party), \"had always been a model employee. He despised amateurs like Brecht who, when they condescended to work at a film studio, whined and sneered and called themselves whores or slaves. Christopher prided himself on his adaptability. Writing a movie was a game, and each game had a different set of rules. Having learned the rules, Christopher could play along with enjoyment.\" Yet as Isherwood and the Christopher of Lost Years know, it is not always clear whether learning the rules is a matter of competence or compliance - part of the pleasure of mastery is the submission it entails. As Christopher learns the game of writing for the movies in Hollywood, and learns to write his own kind of fiction, and learns, above all, to play out his sexuality, he is also trying to invent his own game, to discover his very own rules whatever people might call him as a consequence. \"Wystan was much more mature than Christopher,\" he writes in Christopher and His Kind. \"Labels didn't scare him.\" This is a subtle definition of maturity because it knows so much about intimidation. A lot of Isherwood's characters find themselves jousting at labels. In Lost Years, written between the rather dour memoir of his parents, Kathleen and Frank (completed in 1970), and his great book Christopher and His Kind (published in 1976), Isherwood attempts a stark reconstruction of his early years in California. He is writing in the 1970s about his experience in the late 1940s of being, among other things, a gay man and an aspiring writer. And so he is remembering the old labels in the light of the new ones. And he is writing a memoir that is neither a diary nor a deliberately fictionalised autobiography. Lost Years, Katherine Bucknell tells us in her useful introduction, is part of \"a major new phase - roughly the final third of his career - in which Isherwood moved away from semi-fictionalised writing towards pure autobiography\". 'Pure autobiography' is obviously an odd phrase; and Lost Years is more about what, if anything, such a phrase might mean. Wondering what to write next after finishing Kathleen and Frank - having done his parents, so to speak - Isherwood considered writing a book about his spiritual teacher, Swami Prabhavananda, an adult he had been able to take rather more seriously as a guide to living his life. But it was clear to him, as he noted in his diary at the time, that it would be about the fact that his \"personal approach to Vedanta was, among other things, the approach of a homosexual looking for a religion which will accept him\". So instead of the book he would eventually write as My Guru and His Disciple (1980), Isherwood decided that he would write, largely for himself, a kind of 'reconstructed diary' about his sexual life in those apparently lost years in America. It would be, he wrote, \"quite largely a sexual record and so indiscreet as to be unpublishable. It might keep me amused, like knitting, but I should be getting on with something else.\" It was not clear exactly what a sexual record might be a record of. Or what kind of person the narrator as the recorder of these experiences would turn out to be. As a schoolboy Isherwood had written an essay entitled Omission Is the Beginning of All Art. Lost Years was to be a book in a wholly reputable modern genre: a book about what would otherwise be omitted. But written, at least in the first instance, only for the author. \"Isherwood's 'knitting',\" Bucknell remarks, \"somewhat like the flow of unselfconscious, free-associative talk in psychoanalysis, evidently set his mind free to delve more directly than ever before into his private life. The very insignificance and confidentiality of the task opened new avenues to self-reflection.\" For a writer so fascinated by the performing self to narrow down the audience in this way - to discover what kind of audience he was (or gave) to himself - might well have seemed like a necessary experiment. Isherwood is always at his best when he is showing us how self-consciousness tends to turn up at precisely those moments when we least expect it. Indeed, that we may be most archly self-conscious when we are apparently most forgetful of ourselves. It was his fear that self-consciousness went all the way down - that unselfconsciousness is something we enact, like everything else - that drew Isherwood to eastern religion, and to writing. The knitting of Lost Years stages a more direct delving into the self. And it is as an enquiry - or even as a draft of an enquiry - into the art of self-exposure that it should be read. When it came to writing, self-consciousness for Isherwood meant that there was pressure to be seen to be something - to be someone in particular, a certain kind of character - in one's description of things. So he would be disconcerted when anything interrupted the preferred performances of his writing self. He observed in his diary around the time he was writing Lost Years: \"The main thing I have to offer as a writer are my reactions to experience (these ARE my fiction or my poetry, or whatever you want to call it). Now, these reactions are more positive when I am reacting to actual experiences, than when I am reacting to imagined experiences. Yet, the actuality of the experiences does bother me, the brute facts keep tripping me up, I keep wanting to rearrange and alter the facts so as to relate them more dramatically to my reactions.\" To be a certain kind of writer, you need certain kinds of fact to react to. Altered or rearranged facts bring out the best in Isherwood. There has to be something out there to react to, but it mustn't be too much of an obstacle. Lost Years is an experiment in trying to write (at least a bit) against the grain: he will record the brute facts unaltered, without tripping up. Isherwood starts from the assumption, or rather tries out the idea, that a 'sexual record' of this period of his life suits the brute facts approach. Or at least that brute facts are required in any account of sexual life that isn't pointlessly disingenuous. So the fact that several reviewers of this book have tripped up on some of its brute facts - the unsanctimonious sex, the occasional anti-semitism, the bits of spite - is not entirely surprising. It is not news that we are not as nice as we should be (though what we make of this is sometimes news). But Isherwood is not trying to shock himself: he is seeing what happens - how the sentences come out - when he aims not to rearrange the facts. Not the self stripped of its adjectives, but a documentary about a performing self. \"I am writing this,\" Isherwood begins, \"to clarify my project to myself, not actually to begin work on it . . . Because the 'I' of this period is twenty years out of date, I shall write about him in the third person . . . this helps me to overcome my inhibitions, avoid self-excuses and regard my past behaviour more objectively.\" That inhibition and self-excuse more or less sum up the modern sense of self, that the modern, literary 'I' is always felt to be elsewhere out of date, in the third person, wishing for objectivity etc, is not a mission statement for Isherwood: it is simply the precondition for writing this particular book. The persistent modern project of trying to set the sexual record straight, and not so straight, has to be about the relationship between inhibition and self-excuse. It is, of course, easier to talk about inhibition and self-excuse - about one's ideal self and one's alibis - if one talks about the unconscious. But for Isherwood this is part of the problem rather than any kind of solution: \"Christopher had - and I still have - a deep-seated reluctance to try tinkering with his own psychological mechanism . . . Nowadays, I would say I believe that the unconscious must by its nature remain unconscious. It doesn't belong to me . . . All attempts to meddle with it are therefore attempts to impose my will and my ideas of what is good for me upon the infinitely greater wisdom of the non-self.\" Lost Years is acutely conscious of the way Christopher imposes his will and idea on others (\"Christopher, that shameless flatterer\"). But in writing this particular book he is much more attentive to the ways in which he imposes his will and his ideas on himself. As he reconstructs his past he describes his earlier self as virtually obsessed by self-characterisation; and then, every so often, as strangely guilty as he catches himself in the act. Isherwood quotes a \"coldly contemptuous\" remark about himself from Keith Vaughan's Journal and Drawings in which Vaughan describes Christopher as \"enormously interested in the superficialities of life\". And it is as though by quoting this he is reminding himself of something, trying not to keep certain questions about himself at bay. Because if Lost Years is perplexed about anything it is about what the superficialities of life are and about the things one finds enormously interesting, as opposed to all those things one is supposed to find of such moment. When he writes, for example, of The Unquiet Grave that it is Cyril Connolly's \"most maddening and snobbish book, and for that very reason his most fascinating and self-revealing\", he is remarking that the self is not revealed in its most (obviously) self-revealing places. What Christopher is enormously interested in in Lost Years is sex and, in a rather different sense, in what goes on between people. But he is uncertain - and this is part of the book's subtle amusement - what, if anything, his sexuality reveals about himself. As a \"confirmed self-preserver\" who \"in his inmost heart . . . thought of himself as an art-aristocrat or brahmin, a person privileged by his talent to demand the service (he preferred to call it 'the co-operation') of others\", Christopher is, as he notices, fairly well preserved from being too drastically changed by experience. Lost Years recreates a Christopher poised between a quest (and therefore the acknowledgment of some discontent) and a sense that the quest - which takes a more or less religious form - may itself be a distraction, that what Christopher most wants to be is what he already is: gay and a writer of considerable ambition and talent. It is a choice - though Isherwood does not present it in these terms - between the unmaking of the (familiar) self and making the self up, between a disciplined anonymity and being a character. In so far as Lost Years tells a story - it is, of course, integral to Isherwood's project that the book is unplotted, just strung-together anecdotes about what he remembers doing - it is about Isherwood's sexual preferences beginning to come adrift from his spiritual commitments. Not wishing to \"fool everyone into thinking him a saint\", Isherwood leaves the Vedanta Center, the religious community that had been his home, with a clear sense, at least in retrospect, of what he was up to: \"Should he have left the Center much sooner than he did? Looking back, I find that I can't say yes. It now seems to me that Christopher's embarrassment and guilt feelings were of little importance and his 'spiritual struggles' trivial. What mattered was that he was getting exposure to Swami, that his relations with Swami continued to be (fairly) frank, and that he never ceased to be aware of Swami's love. That he kept slipping away to see Bill Harris wasn't really so dreadful.\" What Isherwood catches so well here - and throughout the book - is the self-importance of the present moment; the possibility that our immersion in our lives as we live them - our 'spiritual struggles' - is an inevitable distraction from many points of view. If it is only in retrospect that we can avoid being so narrow-minded about ourselves, even see that narrow-minded is just what we have been, then recollection, Isherwood intimates, may be the best cure for egotism. What was once a melodrama of moral absolutes becomes a world in which being '(fairly) frank' is fair enough. We may look better if we rearrange the facts, but rearranging the facts is also moral propaganda. Christopher did feel guilt, embarrassment, dread, spiritual struggle then: what Isherwood now sees is an intense sexual and spiritual pragmatism at work. Christopher, he now recognises, boasted of his suffering as a cover-story for his real preferences. Lost Years is exhilarating because it is Isherwood's attempt to discover what mattered: not why it mattered to him, but that it mattered. And what is so artful about the writing in this book is that Isherwood's explanations of his own behaviour sound simply like descriptions. It is as though he is saying: this is what Christopher was like, but with none of the usual moral invitations to the reader. Modern self-disclosure is always a provocation: it asks us to assess the self, to judge if we dare. Lost Years is more like autobiography as natural history. If there is no point in talking about what a mollusc should be like, why describe what a person should be like? But erotic life is a big problem for natural history. The main drama of Lost Years is the young Isherwood's love affair with a man called Caskey, and the various sexual affairs and encounters that go on around it. What is most striking about the way Isherwood, in being as fairly frank and straightforward as possible, describes their differences is that they sound like perfect opposites. By refusing to be 'novelistic' the characters seem to revert to allegorical type. Christopher appears to be eminently sensible (even about his promiscuity), while Caskey \"didn't want his life to be predictable . . . He would tidy the house one day, and drunkenly wreck it the next.\" Isherwood's account of their relationship is also, unwittingly perhaps, a formulation of a dilemma about writing. \"Christopher's reasonableness, the justice of his case, the moderation of his demands upon Caskey were a bit TOO convincing - and he knew it. Relations between two human beings who are supposed to love each other - and perhaps actually do, from time to time - cannot be regulated by a code of rules. The truth is that Christopher was no more reasonable than Caskey; he merely had a knack of manoeuvring himself into positions in which he was, technically, 'in the right' - whereupon Caskey, with his passive obstinacy, would not only accept the counterposition of being 'in the wrong' but would proceed to make the wrong as wrong as he possibly could. He always behaved worst when there was no conceivable excuse for his behaviour. That was his kind of integrity.\" In Isherwood's view Christopher is often up to his old tricks; and Christopher's trick is in any given situation to privilege his own position. (By the same token, much of Isherwood's fiction is a critique of the self-justifying voice). Christopher has the knack of being very impressed by himself; and Lost Years is heartening because Isherwood is more than willing to be charmed by this, and also to enjoy seeing through it (ruthless unmasking would be just another knack of the self-important). To suggest that there were two kinds of integrity in play here, and not merely two wilful egotisms, is to suggest that integrity comes in a variety of forms, and that one of its functions is violent defensiveness. It is as though in writing Lost Years Isherwood was thinking about how to be as unself-protective a writer as possible without losing his sense of humour or, indeed, his pleasure as a novelist in people's self-protectiveness, their flair for self-assurance. He has a great eye for vanity because his suspicion of it is part of his relish for it. Isherwood wrote Lost Years in a spirit of generous suspicion about his younger self. Though there are sudden (and shocking) moments of self-loathing in the book, he is not keen to be lured into the refuge of self-criticism. As though to take against his former self would be a tactless self-betrayal. \"I have no right to sneer at Christopher's soul-searchings,\" he writes in parenthesis, \"just because they were conducted amidst bottles and boys - but they do embarrass me.\" That one's former self has rights, that there should be no privileged position from which to judge one's future or ex-selves, doesn't prevent embarrassment, or the regret at feeling it. That one could (or should) feel embarrassed about one's embarrassment - that shame might be trivial (to use one of Isherwood's key words) in the larger scale of things - is the version of moral progress that Isherwood was after. The terror of being judged, and the ruses of character required to avoid complicity with the more severely demeaning forms it can take, is everywhere in the stark and amused soul-searching of Lost Years. And the only authority that is affectionately embraced in the book is EM Forster. \"Christopher was still a little in awe of him. Not because he thought of Forster as a great writer and as his particular master - he did, but this didn't make him uneasy in Forster's presence; Christopher, who spent so much of his life playing the teacher, found it pleasant and relaxing to become a disciple, now and then.

Their glance made Christopher feel false and tricky. Christopher reacted to this feeling by trying to make Forster laugh. He usually could; the uneasier he felt, the more sparkling his comedy act became.\" This is one of the most interesting double-acts in the book - Lost Years continually stages what-Christopher-was-like in the presence of certain significant (and not so significant) others - and one Isherwood redescribes in Christopher and His Kind. The truthfulness that makes Christopher feel 'false and tricky'; and the comedy act he uses to manage his unease is where Christopher - and in a different sense, where Isherwood as a writer - is most interestingly poised.

And in Christopher and His Kind it is the baby Forster that Isherwood goes on about: \"He had a baby's vulnerability, which is also the invulnerability of a creature whom one dare not harm. He seemed to be swaddled baby-like, in his ill-fitting suit rather than wearing it . . . a friend who was present at the last meeting between them made the comment: 'Mr Forster laughs at you as if you were the village idiot.'\" Forster's vulnerability is as much a protection racket, and as integral to who he is, as Christopher's comedy act. To be false and tricky and to sparkle under certain kinds of pressure is as much part of Christopher's truthfulness as being a morally insidious baby is part of Forster's truthfulness. Isherwood as a writer wants to resist the lure of morally privileged positions, while acknowledging the interest of their power. If Christopher had become a stern and alarming moralist in Forster's presence his own truth could not have been told.

You never feel, reading Lost Years, that Christopher won't come through, because he keeps coming across the right person. And he knows that there are plenty of them. And that they are going to be right for different reasons and for different things. \u0095 To read more online essays from the current edition of the London Review of Books visit the LRB.

      "body": "<p><strong>How big is the NHS budget?</strong><br> In March 2000 the chancellor Gordon Brown unveiled a \"historic\" four-year, \u00a319bn package of funding for the NHS that will bring the UK closer to the European average on health spending and, in theory, stem the damage of years of underfunding. He announced average real increases of 6.1% over the coming four years, which is claimed to be the longest period of sustained growth in the service's 52-year history. With this increase, the NHS budget will reach <strong>\u00a368.7bn</strong> by 2003-04, some \u00a319.4bn more than in 1999-00. </p> <p>This massive cash injection follows a wretched winter crisis for the NHS, with ministers under fire over bed shortages, cancelled operations, overcrowded casualty departments, staff shortages, and a flu \"epidemic\". After being pressed on claims of NHS underfunding by TV interviewer David Frost in January, Tony Blair promised that the government would increase health spending up to the European average. In fact, despite the extra billions this target will be missed. </p> <p>According to the Treasury, total health spending will rise to 7.6% of national wealth or gross domestic product by 2003-04. This compares with a current European average of around 8%: 9.6% in France; 10.7% in Germany; and 13.9% in the US. </p> <p><strong>Are the extra billions enough?</strong><br> There is no doubt that the rise is significant, raising UK health spending per household from \u00a31,850 in 1998-99 to \u00a32,800 in 2003-04. However, it is unlikely to prevent calls for additional resources. Rising public expectations of the NHS, the pressure to fund the use of expensive new technologies and drugs, and staff pay demands will continue to put pressure on the NHS budget. The NHS also has to juggle investment with historical financial <strong>deficits</strong> in trusts and health authorities of up to <strong>\u00a3700m</strong>.</p> <p><strong>How is the NHS financed?</strong><br> Over 90% of NHS spending is met from general taxation and an element of national insurance contributions. The remainder comes largely from the receipts of land and property sales and a small amount from charges. </p> <p>This year the government has experimented with \"hypothecated taxes\", earmarking <strong>\u00a3300m</strong> from tobacco tax increases for the NHS. The NHS plan, published in summer 2000, concluded that \"the way the NHS is financed continues to make sense\" and rejected alternatives such as private insurance, social insurance, new charges and rationing.</p> <p><strong>Who gets the money?</strong><br> The <strong>\u00a354.2bn allocation</strong> for the NHS across the UK in 2000-01 translates into \u00a344.2bn in England. Scotland will this year spend \u00a35.4bn on health, Wales around \u00a33bn and Northern Ireland's combined health and social services budget is just over \u00a32bn.</p> <p> &amp;#149Over half of the hospital and community health services budget goes on providing <strong>acute services</strong>, the general term for medical and surgical interventions provided in hospitals. </p> <p> &amp;#149 <strong>Mental health</strong> accounts for a further 12% while dedicated services for the elderly take a further 10% (although elderly people receive a lot more spending through other parts of the budget).</p> <p> &amp;#149 Three areas, mental health, cancer and coronary heart disease, have been identified as clear <strong>priorities</strong> for investment. </p> <p> &amp;#149The vast majority of the English allocation, some \u00a334.3bn, is distributed through the country's 99 health authorities in <strong>unified budget allocations</strong>, which were introduced in 1999 to break down some of the artificial boundaries between hospital and primary care funding. </p> <p> &amp;#149These allocations are then passed down to new <strong>primary care groups</strong> and primary care trusts, which in addition to overseeing GP services will commission hospital services. </p> <p> &amp;#149 The largest proportion of each health authority's unified budget pays for services that are provided by <strong>trusts</strong>. But the budgets also cover GPs' staff, premises, computer and prescribing costs. </p> <p>By bringing prescribing inside the unified budgets, drug costs are now <strong>\"cash-limited\"</strong> in an attempt to keep their expense down. In addition to their unified budgets, health authorities also administer a non-cash-limited family health services budget, which covers allowances and fees charged by GPs, and payments to opticians, dentists and pharmacists. For the current year this amounts to <strong>\u00a34.2bn</strong>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "How big is the NHS budget? In March 2000 the chancellor Gordon Brown unveiled a \"historic\" four-year, \u00a319bn package of funding for the NHS that will bring the UK closer to the European average on health spending and, in theory, stem the damage of years of underfunding. He announced average real increases of 6.1% over the coming four years, which is claimed to be the longest period of sustained growth in the service's 52-year history. With this increase, the NHS budget will reach \u00a368.7bn by 2003-04, some \u00a319.4bn more than in 1999-00. This massive cash injection follows a wretched winter crisis for the NHS, with ministers under fire over bed shortages, cancelled operations, overcrowded casualty departments, staff shortages, and a flu \"epidemic\". After being pressed on claims of NHS underfunding by TV interviewer David Frost in January, Tony Blair promised that the government would increase health spending up to the European average. In fact, despite the extra billions this target will be missed. According to the Treasury, total health spending will rise to 7.6% of national wealth or gross domestic product by 2003-04. This compares with a current European average of around 8%: 9.6% in France; 10.7% in Germany; and 13.9% in the US. Are the extra billions enough? There is no doubt that the rise is significant, raising UK health spending per household from \u00a31,850 in 1998-99 to \u00a32,800 in 2003-04. However, it is unlikely to prevent calls for additional resources. Rising public expectations of the NHS, the pressure to fund the use of expensive new technologies and drugs, and staff pay demands will continue to put pressure on the NHS budget. The NHS also has to juggle investment with historical financial deficits in trusts and health authorities of up to \u00a3700m. How is the NHS financed? Over 90% of NHS spending is met from general taxation and an element of national insurance contributions. The remainder comes largely from the receipts of land and property sales and a small amount from charges. This year the government has experimented with \"hypothecated taxes\", earmarking \u00a3300m from tobacco tax increases for the NHS. The NHS plan, published in summer 2000, concluded that \"the way the NHS is financed continues to make sense\" and rejected alternatives such as private insurance, social insurance, new charges and rationing. Who gets the money? The \u00a354.2bn allocation for the NHS across the UK in 2000-01 translates into \u00a344.2bn in England. Scotland will this year spend \u00a35.4bn on health, Wales around \u00a33bn and Northern Ireland's combined health and social services budget is just over \u00a32bn. \u2022Over half of the hospital and community health services budget goes on providing acute services, the general term for medical and surgical interventions provided in hospitals. \u2022 Mental health accounts for a further 12% while dedicated services for the elderly take a further 10% (although elderly people receive a lot more spending through other parts of the budget). \u2022 Three areas, mental health, cancer and coronary heart disease, have been identified as clear priorities for investment. \u2022The vast majority of the English allocation, some \u00a334.3bn, is distributed through the country's 99 health authorities in unified budget allocations, which were introduced in 1999 to break down some of the artificial boundaries between hospital and primary care funding. \u2022These allocations are then passed down to new primary care groups and primary care trusts, which in addition to overseeing GP services will commission hospital services. \u2022 The largest proportion of each health authority's unified budget pays for services that are provided by trusts. But the budgets also cover GPs' staff, premises, computer and prescribing costs. By bringing prescribing inside the unified budgets, drug costs are now \"cash-limited\" in an attempt to keep their expense down. In addition to their unified budgets, health authorities also administer a non-cash-limited family health services budget, which covers allowances and fees charged by GPs, and payments to opticians, dentists and pharmacists. For the current year this amounts to \u00a34.2bn.",

David O'Leary, a strong believer in that philosophy, can sympathise with Advocaat's injury-list tales of woe. Had Leeds been knocked out of the Champions League last night, he too could have concluded, as Advocaat did, that such a result was \"understandable\". But that didn't happen. All three English teams qualified for the second phase of the Champions League - a fact which can be attributed largely to the rigorous Premiership schedule. How often do Rangers play in matches that require immense mental and physical stamina? If truth be told, only against Celtic and in Europe. There has been talk of an Atlantic League, which would involve Rangers and Celtic joining sides from Portugal, Holland, Belgium and Scandanavia in 2003 - but that is looking increasingly unlikely as other European sides have delayed backing the project. Perhaps it's because they are not in as serious a situation as Rangers, who must act now. It took Fergie's babes several years before they started getting it right abroad. Rangers would have to undergo a similar learning curve. But it would be worth it. Because I believe they can be the champions of Europe in ten years time - providing they cross the border and learn the battle of endurance that is the Premiership. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

Meanwhile an \u00a3800m neighbourhood renewal fund will be divided between the 88 most deprived local authorities, which will be free to choose how they spend it - as long as they put local strategic partnerships in place and meet the targets set out in their public service agreements. Given that the government is starting to put its money where its mouth is, it's no wonder there's a mood of optimism among much of the voluntary sector. The mood is encapsulated in the response from the Urban Forum, an umbrella group for voluntary organisations working in deprived areas, to the consultation on the neighbourhood renewal strategy. The forum says: \"The draft national strategy for neighbourhood renewal is the most far-reaching, analytical and exciting development yet undertaken by this government, and the most impressive report on neighbourhood renewal in many people's living memory. The draft strategy is full of good ideas, stimulates the imagination and provides an excellent starting point for policies and actions that can turn round deprived neighbourhoods.\"",

      "trailText": "<p>1 <strong>Naz1 asked</strong> How deep does the corruption in cricket go, and how long has it been going on                                for? </p>",

      "body": "<p>1 <strong>Naz1 asked</strong> How deep does the corruption in cricket go, and how long has it been going on for? </p> <p> <strong>Tim de Lisle replied</strong> If I knew that, there would be no need for Sir Paul Condon, and his team of detectives, and all the match-fixing inquiries. Wisden doesn't have any inside knowledge (happily), although we hear the press-box rumours. My guess is that corruption has gone wide rather than deep, and has always been spread quite thinly. It feels as if there has been an avalanche of match-fixing and betting stories, yet when you think about it, there are still only a few matches which are definitely known to have been fixed. Even Hansie Cronje has only admitted to tampering with a few games. Mike Atherton said last summer that there was only one match he had played in that felt fixed (no, he didn't say which one), so that's one out of 102 Tests plus 50-odd one-day matches. Of course, this doesn't mean there isn't a problem. A cancer is still a cancer even if not many people have it. The standard view on how long match-fixing has been going on, repeated in Pakistan's Qayyum Report, is around 20 years. But do remember that cricket has a very long history and that it was associated with betting, and chicanery, long before it acquired its connotations of fair play. </p> <p> 2 <strong>miner49er asked</strong> How do you call England's forthcoming Test series against Pakistan? </p> <p> <strong>Tim de Lisle replied</strong> As a defeat! England have improved a lot under Nasser Hussain and Duncan Fletcher, but they are no more than a mid-table team at the moment and their away form is very poor - the only team they have beaten away from home in the last decade is New Zealand, when they were less strong than are now. Pakistan are wildly unpredictable but England seem to bring out the best in them, and as you say, England are just not designed for turning pitches. If England come out with a result better than 0-2, they will have done well. </p> <p>3 <strong>Meatloaf asked</strong> Is Marcus Trescothick the future of English cricket? </p> <p> <strong>Tim de Lisle replied</strong> I hope so, but have tried to avoid saying so, because prophecies like that have a way of being the opposite of self-fulfilling. Trescothick made the perfect start to his international career, and it wasn't just his scores (a string of 70s and 80s) that were encouraging. He exuded the sort of relaxed positivity that most England batsmen take years to display. He left the ball very well, which is crucial for a lefthander, but he also gave it a good thump off both the front and back foot. And he was making runs on surfaces that were green and treacherous, unlike the nice flat tracks he is used to at Taunton. Today's innings of 93 in Peshawar confirms the feeling that his bubble is not about to burst, although there is bound to be a bad patch some time - I just hope the selectors keep faith with him, as they have failed to with so many young players. </p> <p> 4 <strong>Dug asked</strong> What future vision do we need if Test cricket is to remain a viable and lively sport? What are your views on such innovations as lights in poor playing conditions? </p> <p> <strong>Tim de Lisle replied</strong> The sad irony of the match-fixing imbroglio is that Test cricket is actually in a very healthy state. The last decade has been a golden age, with several of the great new-ball combinations of all time in action simultaneously -- Ambrose and Walsh, Wasim and Waqar, Donald and Pollock, and now the mouthwatering trio of McGrath, Brett Lee and Gillespie. We have two of the greatest spinners in history, in Warne and Muralitharan; two of the greatest batsmen, in Lara and Tendulkar; and one of the strongest personalities, in Steve Waugh. And several of the closest results in history have taken place in the last few years. So there is no problem with the game's vitality. Viability is more of a worry: crowds in some countries have fallen away or defected to the one-day game. The answer is for ICC to adopt the Wisden World Championship or something very like it(see next answer), so as to add meaning to every Test. And yes, they should certainly be open-minded enough to switch the lights on. </p> <p> 5 <strong> aloo2000 wrote</strong> Tim, do you feel the current Wisden Test table truly reflects the standings of the teams? I feel the flaws are that it does not: (1) consider the difference between a tight series and a total washout, or (2) distinguish home advantage and away disadvantage. </p> <p> <strong>Tim de Lisle replied</strong> I think it's a pretty good reflection. I certainly haven't seen a better one - and I speak as one who didn't invent it (that was Matthew Engel). It's certainly not perfect, and I agree with you to an extent about (2) -- an away win is usually a lot harder to pull off than a home one. But I'm not bothered about (1) -- it's the nature of sporting tables that they don't reflect the closeness of the game, unless the game remains close to the very last, and ends up as a draw or tie. Man Utd get the same number of points for a 1-0 win as for a 5-0. </p> <p> 6 <strong>KenDavro wrote</strong> What football team do you support? </p> <p> <strong> Tim de Lisle replied</strong> As you might guess from the last answer, I support Man Utd. I'm a typical supporter: I live about 200 miles away and have only been to Old Trafford (the footballing one) once, when, naturally, they lost. But I can claim reasonable longevity. I fell for them because of George Best. The first game I remember was when they beat Northampton Town 8-2 in the Cup, in 1969-70 I think, and Best scored six. What I saw in them then - fabulous flair and excitement, most of it generated by players who were not bought - I still see, as long as Roy Keane is injured or suspended.</p> <p>7 <strong>tentoone wrote</strong> Congrats for rescuing WCM from Col. Blimp territory. We look forward to similar innovation on the site. Perhaps there will be scope with a more provincial woops I mean less provincial approach on line given the more cosmopolitan audience. The focus on English County cricket, while it sells the mag locally, is of little interest to those who want to focus on REAL first class cricket!!! Regards from Oz </p> <p> <strong>Tim de Lisle replied</strong> Thanks. Yes, we are hoping to do something similar with the website, and yes, we will certainly try to be more cosmpolitan. Already, about half of our emails come from outside the UK, so the site will reflect that. Sorry you don't feel that county cricket is first-class. Still, at least it boosts the bank balances of some of your guys. </p> <p> 8 <strong>JGK wrote</strong> Do you have any jobs going that involve copious amounts of watching cricket and writing the occasional article or commentary? </p> <p><strong> Tim de Lisle replied</strong> I wish. We do manage quite a lot of watching, but it's mostly on the telly. Making pages, whether for the web or the magazine, is largely done from offices. And even the people in the press box work hard -- the day may have a gentle start but it has a furiously busy end. If you want an easy life, don't be a cricket writer. If you want an interesting life, do. And yes, we will have some jobs going soon -- details will be posted on wisden.com. </p> <p> 9 <strong>JR Canning wrote</strong> Who is the best batsman you have seen? </p> <p> <strong>Tim de Lisle replied</strong> Viv Richards, because he was the most fearsome, the most dominant -- although if TV had moved a little faster, and I had seen Sunil Gavaskar make one of his 13 hundreds against West Indies during the same era, I might well have gone for him. Richards's figures were certainly helped by the fact that he never had to face Holding, Roberts, Garner and Croft. But he wasn't really about figures, he was about power and strength and attitude, and nobody surpassed him in those areas. Of today's batsmen, my favourite is Brian Lara, whose huge backlift expands the possibilities of every ball he faces. </p> <p>10 <strong>Naz1 wrote</strong> Do you think Lord MacLaurin was highly hypocritical when he didn't call Alec Stewart back home, considering that he wanted several Pakistanis banned just before a Test series tour which has enough controversy and history as it is? </p> <p> <strong>Tim de Lisle replied</strong> Yes, there was a whiff of hypocrisy, but if MacLaurin had called Stewart home, there would have been a worse smell, of sheer injustice. It would have been a case of two wrongs not making a right. Stewart has not been accused of match-fixing, nor is he under suspicion of it. He has been accused of taking money for information, the same thing that Shane Warne and Mark Waugh admitted to, and dating from the same period -- the early to mid-Nineties, which was a more innocent time. Warne and Waugh weren't banned, so it would be very rough justice for Stewart to be, even if the case against him had been proven. MacLaurin's series of statements was inept, which is perhaps preferable to being unjust. </p> <p> 11 <strong>NeoLeo wrote</strong> What do u suggest can be done to create Pakistan-like cricket craziness in England? </p> <p> <strong>Tim de Lisle replied</strong> Abolish football. </p> <p> 12 <strong>NeoLeo added</strong> By the way, would the scrapping of the tie-wearing tradition help? </p> <p> <strong> Tim de Lisle replied</strong> Yes, I think it would. It's a very odd idea, that the spectators should be more formally dressed than the players. I wouldn't want to stop anyone wearing a tie if he wants to, but I can't for the life of me see why it should be compulsory in any part of the ground. Many City firms have managed to break free from this tradition: why can't MCC? </p> <p>13 <strong>chisibm wrote</strong> So do you think Stewart is guilty? </p> <p> <strong>Tim de Lisle replied</strong> No, I don't. I can't see why he would lie about it if he was. He has more to lose by lying than by admitting to the alleged offence -- which, at the time, was not an offence at all. He is not a devious person. I could be wrong, of course: the terrible legacy of Cronje is that you don't know who to believe any more. But given the choice, I would rather be too credulous than too cynical. </p> <p> 14 <strong>ScottM wrote</strong> What's this 'major expansion' of the website all about, then? </p> <p> <strong>Tim de Lisle replied</strong> It's about trying to give you something bigger, though not huge, and much better, ready for the next English season. Cricket is perfectly suited to the web with its slow rhythms and global reach and fervent fans. But so far, the leading sites are only really good at delivering scores and basic news. We think we can offer more than that. This site will be going into hibernation from this weekend, running jonly weekly comments on the game, while we work on the relaunch. Send us an email (wisden@johnbrown.co.uk) and we will email you back when the site reopens for business in a few months' time. Meanwhile, thanks for coming. </p> <p>15 <strong>chisibm wrote</strong> with a third umpire on hand at Test matches now, what do you think of the following? Two umpires do first session then the third umpire and one of the two does the next and then the 3rd umpire and other do final, that way each umpire does two sessions a day, surely if he's less mentally tired he'll make less mistakes? </p> <p><strong> Tim de Lisle replied</strong> Good idea. The third umpire is ridiculously under-used. And the two men in the middle are out there for far longer than the players, who are usually a lot younger and fitter than them. </p> <p> 16 <strong>Pedant wrote</strong> Are you familiar with the Rodney Ross method for Test team rankings? It can be found on the Cricinfo site, under the Database section. It is similar to your own Wisden World Championship, and uses home and away series results over the past few years. However, it gives more credit for comprehensive victories as opposed to narrow wins, and it also makes a distintion between home wins and the more difficult away wins. In my opinion, it gives more realistic rankings. For instance, at present it has the West Indies and New Zealand in joint fifth spot. I feel that this gives a better indication of these two teams' current position in Test cricket, compared to the equivalent Wisden rankings (3rd and 7th respectively). </p> <p> <strong>Tim de Lisle replied</strong> I wasn't familiar with the Ross rankings but I am now. Something we all felt when we were launching the Wisden table, this time four years ago, was that it should be simple. As I said in another answer, I have alot of sympathy with the idea that away series wins should be rewarded. But I haven't been able to convince Matthew Engel of that. West Indies are a peculiar problem at the moment. I suspect that wherever they were in our table, it would feel wrong to some people, because they are two completely different teams at home and away. At home, they haven't lost their most recent encounter with anybody, not even Australia (2-2 in 1998-99). But away, as you know, they have suffered a series of heavy defeats. The same used to be true of India, and I remember Mike Atherton saying he thought their position (usually fifth or sixth) flattered them. But the great thing is, the table is objective. It simply goes by the most recent pair of meetings between each pair of teams. And thanks to the increase in the volume of international cricket, there are fewer old series in there -- last English winter (1999-2000), something like 16 series results in the table were replaced. So if New Zealand continue their improvement, they will soon go up by more than the two places they have already climbed. </p> <p> 17 <strong>ross13 wrote</strong> Tim -- If an ordinary person with a keen interest in the history of the game made a submission to the Wisden group about errors in the record lists they use, AND indicated precise sources backing up their claims thus allowing Wisden staff to verify the authenticity of the information, would you bother to read it? Or does the Wisden group only take \"submissions\" from media personalities? </p> <p> <strong>Tim de Lisle replied</strong> Why do I get a vague sense of have-you-stopped-beating-your-wife about this question? Wisden has a reputation for accuracy to live up to and we have a policy, across the Almanack, the Monthly and the website, of correcting errors. This year's Almanack contains corrections on page 1294 of eight or nine errors including a couple that are around 50 years old. Our in-house oracle on the records is Harriet Monkhouse, the deputy editor of the Almanack. And no, you certainly don't have to be a media person in order to get her attention. Many of the people working here are young and relatively unknown, though some of them are doubtless big-name cricket writers of the future. </p> <p> 18 <strong>mintcake1974 wrote</strong> 'new' wisden.com...At the moment, you have one long strip of text, with headings, it does not stand out at all. But I am sure that will be rectified? When will things hopefully appear on the web? How will it co-exist with the magazine? What will make me 'subscribe' to both? </p> <p><strong> Tim de Lisle replied</strong> Sorry about the long strip, that's a new one, although it happened to me at home once when we tried to display the draw for the recent ICC Knockout Trophy in two dimensions. Try consulting userhelp@theguardian.com. </p> <p> The new-look wisden.com will go live in time for the international season in England next summer. It will have a distinct existence, separate from both the magazine and the Almanack, although drawing on both. The web is a different medium with its own properties and possibilities, and we are not setting out to copy either of our big sisters. The most obvious difference will be that we will get first crack at stories -- no more waiting for a month before anyone can see what we have to say. But the brand values will be much the same, and I am delighted to announce that Steven Lynch, who has been managing editor of Wisden Cricket Monthly since some time in the Jurassic age, is joining us at Wisden Online, to take charge of our new database. He will also be continuing his popular web column, Ask Steven (steven.lynch@johnbrown.co.uk).</p>",

Our in-house oracle on the records is Harriet Monkhouse, the deputy editor of the Almanack. And no, you certainly don't have to be a media person in order to get her attention. Many of the people working here are young and relatively unknown, though some of them are doubtless big-name cricket writers of the future. 18 mintcake1974 wrote 'new' wisden.com...At the moment, you have one long strip of text, with headings, it does not stand out at all. But I am sure that will be rectified? When will things hopefully appear on the web? How will it co-exist with the magazine? What will make me 'subscribe' to both? Tim de Lisle replied Sorry about the long strip, that's a new one, although it happened to me at home once when we tried to display the draw for the recent ICC Knockout Trophy in two dimensions. Try consulting userhelp@theguardian.com. The new-look wisden.com will go live in time for the international season in England next summer. It will have a distinct existence, separate from both the magazine and the Almanack, although drawing on both. The web is a different medium with its own properties and possibilities, and we are not setting out to copy either of our big sisters. The most obvious difference will be that we will get first crack at stories -- no more waiting for a month before anyone can see what we have to say. But the brand values will be much the same, and I am delighted to announce that Steven Lynch, who has been managing editor of Wisden Cricket Monthly since some time in the Jurassic age, is joining us at Wisden Online, to take charge of our new database. He will also be continuing his popular web column, Ask Steven (steven.lynch@johnbrown.co.uk).",

Fortunately that particular moment passed - the miracles of modern medicine, eh? - and today we felt strong enough to take our rightful place, just behind Brian Woolnough's towering bouffant, in the England press conference.</p> <p>What we heard was most interesting - although if you're a England international over 30 and you don't play for Aston Villa you should look away now. Peter Taylor's New England contains no Adams, no Keown, no Wise, no Ince and no Sheringham. And there's no place for Andy or Joe Cole either. Instead, come on down Michael Ball, Wes Brown, Nicky Butt, Frank Lampard, Paul Robinson, Alan Smith and Seth Johnson... because the time is right.</p> <p>However, Taylor was quick to reassure Adams and chums that this was no November revolution. \"I've decided to go with players of 30 years or younger because it's a friendly and it's worth experimenting,\" the caretaker explained. \"It's worth taking a chance.

They certainly don't have to worry about money any more, because having qualified for the second matchleaguephase of Big Cup, they've just been given an extra \u00a310m by those avuncular chaps at Uefa. You can almost hear David O'Leary whooping in a quasi-religious manner from here.</p> <p>\"Progress to the next phase was the main concern, with the financial side almost secondary,\" explained Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale, lighting a fag from a burning \u00a350 note. \"But we said to the stock exchange that we would reinvest the money we made in [Big Cup] in the squad.\"</p> <p>West Ham defender Rio Ferdinand is top of manager Dave's shopping list - after all, you can't seriously embark on world domination without a ball-playing defender who goes to sleep for, on average, seven minutes per match. It's rumoured that West Ham are finally prepared to accept Leeds' \u00a315m bid, so Rio could be playing in a Leeds shirt very soon.</p> <p>Sadly, until the big deal is sorted out, all Leeds fans have to look forward to is the arrival of cheapo Brann Bergen strikers Azar Karadas and Thorstein Helstad.

LAUGHING ALL THE WAY TO THE LEEDS Now that Leeds are officially the best team in Europe, it's about time they went crazy in the transfer market. They certainly don't have to worry about money any more, because having qualified for the second matchleaguephase of Big Cup, they've just been given an extra \u00a310m by those avuncular chaps at Uefa. You can almost hear David O'Leary whooping in a quasi-religious manner from here. \"Progress to the next phase was the main concern, with the financial side almost secondary,\" explained Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale, lighting a fag from a burning \u00a350 note. \"But we said to the stock exchange that we would reinvest the money we made in [Big Cup] in the squad.\" West Ham defender Rio Ferdinand is top of manager Dave's shopping list - after all, you can't seriously embark on world domination without a ball-playing defender who goes to sleep for, on average, seven minutes per match. It's rumoured that West Ham are finally prepared to accept Leeds' \u00a315m bid, so Rio could be playing in a Leeds shirt very soon. Sadly, until the big deal is sorted out, all Leeds fans have to look forward to is the arrival of cheapo Brann Bergen strikers Azar Karadas and Thorstein Helstad. After all, there's no fun to be had with players who cost less than \u00a310m. What's Mark Viduka ever done, for example? THE RUMOUR MILL Celtic and Rangers are slugging it out to sign Liverpool striker Titi Camara, reports Teamtalk. Lazio have given a cryptic response to rumours that Chelsea have made a \u00a322m bid for Czech Republic international Pavel Nedved, reports onefootball. \"We do not confirm and we do not refute the offer,\" Lazio vice-president Dino Zoff commented. \"But until next June, Nedved will remain at Lazio.\" Paolo Di Canio has turned down a \u00a35m move to Manchester City. NEWS IN BRIEF Tests have shown that the site of the 2002 World Cup final in Japan has been polluted with high levels of potentially dangerous toxic waste. A spokesman for the SYS Citizen's environmental survey team said: \"The situation is quite serious and we are very much concerned about holding the World Cup final on this contaminated site. We cannot accept a reckless approach without taking sufficient measures to protect the environment and the health risk to the citizens of the neighbourhood and also the visitors of the World Cup final.\" Geoffrey Richmond has received a bumper crop of applicants for the vacant manager's position at Bradford City. \"I'm delighted with the quality of applicants,\" he claimed. \"There are some big names amongst them who've not been speculated upon in the media.\" Manchester United, Arsenal and Leeds will be kept apart in tomorrow's Big Cup draw. The group winners and runners-up have been ranked according to their Uefa coefficient with the top four seeds, headed by holders Real Madrid, in Pot 1. Pot 1: Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Valencia, AC Milan. Pot 2: Deportivo La Coruna, Arsenal, Anderlecht, Sturm Graz. Pot 3: Lazio, Manchester United, Spartak Moscow, Paris Saint-Germain. Pot 4: Olympique Lyonnais, Galatasaray, Panathinaikos, Leeds. Rudi Voller has been appointed manager of Germany until after the 2002 World Cup. Former Norwich and Everton boss Mike Walker has been appointed the new manager of Cypriot club Apoel Nicosia.

Designed by Stephen Webster, it is ostentatious to the max and going down a storm on both sides of the Atlantic. Leather straps in lurid colours offset the diamond faces to perfection; it has been rumoured that Puff Daddy recently left a New England store with 30 of the things. \u0095 Available from the Patek Philippe store in 15 New Bond St, W1, 020-7493 8866 and Harrods.",

The uncertainty can leave staff hanging in the balance, while tenants claim they have to fight to make their voice heard.</p> <p>The majority of British homes are now owner occupied and councils' scope for building has been heavily restricted.

      "bodyText": "The right to buy your council home marked its 20th anniversary this year after two decades that have transformed public housing policy. But the question of what council tenants really want - including a shift to a new landlord - will not go away. The uncertainty can leave staff hanging in the balance, while tenants claim they have to fight to make their voice heard. The majority of British homes are now owner occupied and councils' scope for building has been heavily restricted. Registered social landlords (RSLs) have become the main providers of new social housing. The present government has encouraged this policy, urging councils to consider transferring stock to other landlords. The green paper, \"Quality and Choice\", wants councillors to adopt a more strategic role rather than acting as providers. While a transfer can only happen with tenants' consent, the repair of thousands of dilapidated properties could depend on their transfer to RSLs, which can borrow money while councils remain financially boxed in. There is cynicism about tenants' consultation in some quarters. But in south London, Lewisham council believes it is finding new routes to the future through an independent housing commission. Chaired by Lord Filkin, the commission set out to \"think outside the box\" on housing policy and provide an evidence-based set of options. It included professionals and representatives of policy areas outside housing. In open session it heard witnesses, including government ministers, and filed a report calling for \"better quality, more choice and sustainable communities with a wide range of homes, tenure and income groups\". But did the commission really think beyond current possibilities? The borough's action plan, based on the commission's report and its own public consultation, is in the mainstream of current Whitehall thinking. It recommends housing management partnerships for a third of the stock, and considering an arms-length company for housing management. It also raises the possibility of future stock transfer and using the private finance initiative. Lewisham already had plans to transfer stock in one area turned down by the tenants. And earlier this year, the government rejected its request to be included in the 2000-01 stock transfer programme. Jean Kysow, chair of the Federation of Lewisham Tenants' and Residents' Associations (Feltra) says: \"We had to argue and fight before the commission would take evidence from us and from the private tenants. There were no tenants on the panel, except for one from the citizens' panel. The housing commission has not come up with any new thinking - except that the council should talk with its tenants.\" She adds that tenants' groups have given Feltra a mandate to oppose the earlier proposed stock transfer of 7,200 homes at Forest Hill, Rushey Green and Brockley.

The voluntary and community action codes are in a draft state and can be seen on the NCVO website. The former is due to be published in February 2001 but there is no set date for the latter. The main undertaking of the draft is to ensure that all proposed legislation is assessed for its impact on volunteering and community activity. Other government commitments include identifying aspects of existing policy and practice that create barriers to volunteering. Guidelines on local compacts are now available from the compact secretariat. They cover: \u0095 how to make a start \u0095 what works and what doesn't \u0095 setting up a steering group and identifying preliminary issues \u0095 what a local compact can cover (funding, consultation, partnership) implementation, compliance and review \u0095 appendices on explaining the compact simply, funding local compact work, local government and the modernising agenda, partnership working For further information on the compact, contact: Paul Barasi, compact development officer, NCVO Email: paul.barasi@ncvo-vol.org.uk For copies of all compact materials contact: NCVO Helpdesk on 0800 2798 798",

      "body": "<p>It is time we started talking up residential childcare. The evidence is that working in children's homes requires some of the highest skills and personal qualities in social care.</p> <p>Most children who need support remain with their own families or in foster care, and the numbers in residential care have greatly reduced. The result of this good policy is that young people in children's homes have usually had very damaging experiences and may have had their difficulties compounded by failures in other parts of the care system.</p> <p>The media and the public need very little information to understand that the work is hard and demanding, but this is rarely offered. Why is residential care so stigmatised?</p> <p>It is undeniable that some workers betrayed those they were entrusted to care for and that it took young people rather than professionals, in the main, to reveal the appalling abuse. Nothing can put right the fact that some of those young people paid with their lives and others with a lifetime of lost opportunities.</p> <p>But a bad press for residential childcare has persisted for years, in spite of evidence, including evidence from young people and their families, that good residential care can be liberating, and can keep family relationships healthy. Behind the bad image is a belief, often held by others in social care, that only family-based care is good for children. And this may be combined with a suspicion that anyone wanting to nurture other people's children outside a family is at least odd and at worst a potential abuser.</p> <p>Finally, there is the apparently high cost of residential care. \"Apparently\" because other parts of the care system are not fully costed and the longer term costs of poor care, in terms of careers in crime, poor physical and mental health and low educational achievement are not taken into account. </p> <p>Family-based care is what the vast majority of children need, but a whole range of support is necessary to tailor support to specific needs. Residential childcare is a small, but significant resource. When used well, it can prevent the breakdown of family relationships and offer some young people an option they prefer.</p> <p>We are reaching the point when staff doing the most skilful job in social care are being undermined by public criticism and pinned down by rigid procedures. The very relationships between staff and young people that create the possibility for the young person to flourish are increasingly hard to maintain because of the ways staff have to operate to survive.</p> <p>Expert practitioners tend to leave when they cannot do the job well. The risk is that we will replace them with staff who can do no more than hold on to young people for long enough for them to fend for themselves as young adults. If this happens, it will confirm them on a path toward social exclusion. </p> <p>There are hopeful signs. Examples of high quality residential childcare do exist. They focus on outcomes, a respect for human rights and the young people's values. They have a commitment to a philosophy and model of therapeutic working. More investment will be going into residential childcare training and this group of staff will be among the first registered with the general councils. New legislation is extending the time for supporting young people when they leave care. This should reduce the effects on vulnerable young adults of the sudden withdrawal of support when they move out of residential homes. These positives could start to stop the rot in residential childcare.</p>",

The media and the public need very little information to understand that the work is hard and demanding, but this is rarely offered. Why is residential care so stigmatised? It is undeniable that some workers betrayed those they were entrusted to care for and that it took young people rather than professionals, in the main, to reveal the appalling abuse. Nothing can put right the fact that some of those young people paid with their lives and others with a lifetime of lost opportunities. But a bad press for residential childcare has persisted for years, in spite of evidence, including evidence from young people and their families, that good residential care can be liberating, and can keep family relationships healthy. Behind the bad image is a belief, often held by others in social care, that only family-based care is good for children. And this may be combined with a suspicion that anyone wanting to nurture other people's children outside a family is at least odd and at worst a potential abuser. Finally, there is the apparently high cost of residential care. \"Apparently\" because other parts of the care system are not fully costed and the longer term costs of poor care, in terms of careers in crime, poor physical and mental health and low educational achievement are not taken into account. Family-based care is what the vast majority of children need, but a whole range of support is necessary to tailor support to specific needs. Residential childcare is a small, but significant resource. When used well, it can prevent the breakdown of family relationships and offer some young people an option they prefer. We are reaching the point when staff doing the most skilful job in social care are being undermined by public criticism and pinned down by rigid procedures. The very relationships between staff and young people that create the possibility for the young person to flourish are increasingly hard to maintain because of the ways staff have to operate to survive. Expert practitioners tend to leave when they cannot do the job well. The risk is that we will replace them with staff who can do no more than hold on to young people for long enough for them to fend for themselves as young adults. If this happens, it will confirm them on a path toward social exclusion. There are hopeful signs. Examples of high quality residential childcare do exist. They focus on outcomes, a respect for human rights and the young people's values. They have a commitment to a philosophy and model of therapeutic working. More investment will be going into residential childcare training and this group of staff will be among the first registered with the general councils. New legislation is extending the time for supporting young people when they leave care. This should reduce the effects on vulnerable young adults of the sudden withdrawal of support when they move out of residential homes. These positives could start to stop the rot in residential childcare.",

A group that is new to ethnic monitoring categories, those of mixed background, is strongly over-represented among children in care. The next census in April 2001 - which will be the first to use this category - may well reveal some stark realities for many children from this group.</p> <p>Some decisions leading to compulsory action in both areas are currently outside the reach of the Race Relations Act. None will be in future. Equally, while research has highlighted some of the possible causes of this over-representation, there has been no requirement to tackle those causes. That will also change.</p> <p>Social service departments, whose staff play a crucial part in both areas, will need to: <br> \u0095 consult with ethnic minority representatives in their local community and listen to their concerns; <br> \u0095 ensure that monitoring systems are in place so that patterns of inequality can be brought out into the open; <br> \u0095 make sure that assessments are introduced to pinpoint unjustifiable causes which may lie behind the imbalances; <br> \u0095 have action programmes for change, providing for new practices which will eliminate the problems; <br> \u0095 put in place implementation reviews which ensure that the change is bedded in thoroughly. Change must be understood and carried through at every level and backed by staff performance appraisals so that policy changes do not remain on paper but become real practice. <br> <br> Much work along some of these lines has already been undertaken in mental health and children's services.

      "bodyText": "It is hard to avoid discussion of race and crime these days - and rightly so. The fact that young black men are more likely to be stopped and searched than their white counterparts has become common knowledge. Both the police and community representatives are preparing for the moment next year when this contrast will be something that the law will be brought to bear upon. Black over-representation in another aspect of life may well lead to legal action under the forthcoming amendments to the Race Relations Act. Statistics and research have for years shown that black and Irish men are strongly overrepresented in compulsory mental health treatments. Stark realities A parallel situation arises concerning looked-after children. A group that is new to ethnic monitoring categories, those of mixed background, is strongly over-represented among children in care. The next census in April 2001 - which will be the first to use this category - may well reveal some stark realities for many children from this group. Some decisions leading to compulsory action in both areas are currently outside the reach of the Race Relations Act. None will be in future. Equally, while research has highlighted some of the possible causes of this over-representation, there has been no requirement to tackle those causes. That will also change. Social service departments, whose staff play a crucial part in both areas, will need to: \u0095 consult with ethnic minority representatives in their local community and listen to their concerns; \u0095 ensure that monitoring systems are in place so that patterns of inequality can be brought out into the open; \u0095 make sure that assessments are introduced to pinpoint unjustifiable causes which may lie behind the imbalances; \u0095 have action programmes for change, providing for new practices which will eliminate the problems; \u0095 put in place implementation reviews which ensure that the change is bedded in thoroughly. Change must be understood and carried through at every level and backed by staff performance appraisals so that policy changes do not remain on paper but become real practice. Much work along some of these lines has already been undertaken in mental health and children's services. But what has happened so far has not dented the underlying problems. That work will now have to get under way. \u0095 Gurbux Singh is chairman of the commission for racial equality.",

      "trailText": "<p>Is the film serious underneath its hilarity? Perhaps not entirely, since Sturges, like Sullivan, never quite knew how to do it. But the way his assemblage of characters so often seem to realise their own failings at least betokens a sophisticated, perhaps kindly cynic. People have\ntended to say that Sturges' films were as confused as he was. If that is so, long live abstracted directors, since they tend to see the world as it is rather than as we might wish it to be</p>",
      "byline": "Derek Malcolm",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Preston Sturges was a writer-director the like of which we haven't seen since. He was a well-connected anarchist in a system that frowned on such tendencies - unless they made money. Directors such as Billy Wilder owed a great debt to him. </p> <p>Sturges's America was cheerfully corrupt, absurd and frequently unaware of its own ridiculousness, and his films were so high on comic dynamism that you could readily forgive the wayward lip service to logic. </p> <p>His glory days were brief. Within 10 years of his directorial debut, The Great McGinty (1940), he was worn out, and he died bankrupt in 1959. But in his heyday he made half a dozen comedies as subversive as any now, and a good deal funnier. Sullivan's Travels was probably his masterpiece. </p> <p>It starts off with Joel McCrea's Sullivan, a director of farces who wants to get serious with a script called O Brother, Where Art Thou?, being berated by studio bosses because he doesn't know the meaning of the poverty that Brother talks about. </p> <p>So he borrows a tramp's outfit from the wardrobe department andtakes to the road, with a studio bus full of doctors, bodyguards and secretaries a discreet distance behind him. The more he tries to break away from Hollywood, the faster it comes towards him. After picking up a failed actress who says things like \"There's nothing like a deep-dish movie for driving you into the open\", the rich man's search for poverty ends in a fight with a policeman that has him incarcerated in a chain-gang.</p> <p>In a key scene, he and the other convicts go to a black church hall, where the minister instructs his congregation to welcome those less fortunate. And together everyone roars with laughter at a Disney cartoon.

      "bodyText": "Preston Sturges was a writer-director the like of which we haven't seen since. He was a well-connected anarchist in a system that frowned on such tendencies - unless they made money. Directors such as Billy Wilder owed a great debt to him. Sturges's America was cheerfully corrupt, absurd and frequently unaware of its own ridiculousness, and his films were so high on comic dynamism that you could readily forgive the wayward lip service to logic. His glory days were brief. Within 10 years of his directorial debut, The Great McGinty (1940), he was worn out, and he died bankrupt in 1959. But in his heyday he made half a dozen comedies as subversive as any now, and a good deal funnier. Sullivan's Travels was probably his masterpiece. It starts off with Joel McCrea's Sullivan, a director of farces who wants to get serious with a script called O Brother, Where Art Thou?, being berated by studio bosses because he doesn't know the meaning of the poverty that Brother talks about. So he borrows a tramp's outfit from the wardrobe department andtakes to the road, with a studio bus full of doctors, bodyguards and secretaries a discreet distance behind him. The more he tries to break away from Hollywood, the faster it comes towards him. After picking up a failed actress who says things like \"There's nothing like a deep-dish movie for driving you into the open\", the rich man's search for poverty ends in a fight with a policeman that has him incarcerated in a chain-gang. In a key scene, he and the other convicts go to a black church hall, where the minister instructs his congregation to welcome those less fortunate. And together everyone roars with laughter at a Disney cartoon. Sullivan may not have found seriousness but at last he has found how valuable true comedy is. Unconvincing as this may seem - and certainly sentimental - it is an unforgettable moment, perhaps telling us that the high art Sturges despised is worthless if merely inspired by middle-class guilt. Even if you don't appreciate this defining sequence in the film, everything else gels perfectly: the ridiculous studio bus full of hangers-on trying to get Sullivan out of the scrapes he falls into, the butlers who object to the whole enterprise, the ghastly wife who thinks he's dead and lays flowers on his supposed grave like a fashionable zombie.

The saga began with a notice that her supply would be interrupted in early August while maintenance work was carried out in the neighbourhood. </p> <p>When it was reinstated, the water pressure was so low that it failed to trigger her combination boiler, and so she was left without hot water. Severn Trent promised to investigate, but three months later she is still waiting. </p> <p>Three engineers' appointments were missed; another was cancelled; three engineers turned up unannounced when Vowles was out; and she was given five different reference numbers by staff who promised to - but didn't - call her back. The only spontaneous communication Vowles has received in all this time is a water bill, which she is refusing to pay. </p> <p><strong>\u0095 \"We've clearly not handled Ms Vowles' problem very well to date and we apologise for that,\" says Severn Trent sheepishly. \"We have a lovely way of doing things: customer services pass jobs on to our planning guys, who call the customer and leave their contact number, but this seems to have caused some confusion.\" The press office had more success in dispatching an engineer, who solved the problem in a single visit. Vowles should be in line for compensation, a spokesman promises.</strong> </p> <p><strong> You're expelled</strong><br> </p> <p>\"Without limit; unrestricted\" is the Oxford English Dictionary's interpretation of unlimited. Dixons' definition is more \"limitedly limitless\". David Lee signed up to its Freeserve package that goes by the name of Unlimited Freeserve Time and promises \"unlimited internet calls day and night, 365 days a year\". However, Lee was among a number of subscribers expelled from the system because of \"heavy use\". </p> <p><strong> \u0095 Dixons points to a caveat buried in the terms and conditions which states that users may be disconnected if they make \"abnormal demands\" on the network. \"The 1% of customers that we disconnected were occupying 10% of the network,\" says a spokesman indignantly. </strong></p> <p><strong>So what happened to \"unlimited\" access? \"Unlimited is a standard term used to differentiate between two access products,\" he explains. \"Anyone who knows about the net would recognise what it means.\" Right.

      "bodyText": "High and dry It's a cruel irony that while much of the west country is awash, Jenny Vowles of Stroud is longing for a drop of water in her house. The saga began with a notice that her supply would be interrupted in early August while maintenance work was carried out in the neighbourhood. When it was reinstated, the water pressure was so low that it failed to trigger her combination boiler, and so she was left without hot water. Severn Trent promised to investigate, but three months later she is still waiting. Three engineers' appointments were missed; another was cancelled; three engineers turned up unannounced when Vowles was out; and she was given five different reference numbers by staff who promised to - but didn't - call her back. The only spontaneous communication Vowles has received in all this time is a water bill, which she is refusing to pay. \u0095 \"We've clearly not handled Ms Vowles' problem very well to date and we apologise for that,\" says Severn Trent sheepishly. \"We have a lovely way of doing things: customer services pass jobs on to our planning guys, who call the customer and leave their contact number, but this seems to have caused some confusion.\" The press office had more success in dispatching an engineer, who solved the problem in a single visit. Vowles should be in line for compensation, a spokesman promises. You're expelled \"Without limit; unrestricted\" is the Oxford English Dictionary's interpretation of unlimited. Dixons' definition is more \"limitedly limitless\". David Lee signed up to its Freeserve package that goes by the name of Unlimited Freeserve Time and promises \"unlimited internet calls day and night, 365 days a year\". However, Lee was among a number of subscribers expelled from the system because of \"heavy use\". \u0095 Dixons points to a caveat buried in the terms and conditions which states that users may be disconnected if they make \"abnormal demands\" on the network. \"The 1% of customers that we disconnected were occupying 10% of the network,\" says a spokesman indignantly. So what happened to \"unlimited\" access? \"Unlimited is a standard term used to differentiate between two access products,\" he explains. \"Anyone who knows about the net would recognise what it means.\" Right. Silly us. Time for an update of the OED perhaps? So what does the Advertising Standards Authority make of it? \"It would depend on the warning,\" says a spokesman cautiously. \"If the limitations were mentioned in the terms and conditions it might be OK, but the reader is welcome to contact us.\" Mobile moans Dermod Quirke has stumbled across an equally misleading advert in his quest for cheap phone calls.

So if you live in the \"wrong\" area, and, in extreme cases, on the \"wrong\" side of a road, you may get a poorer service than your neighbour or you may not get the service at all and have to pay for it privately.

Recent examples include variations in charges for disabled people's home care; NHS availability of the multiple sclerosis drug, beta interferon; availability of NHS invitro fertilisation services; waiting times for NHS treatment; assessment of children on social service \"at risk\" registers, access to NHS cancer screening programmes, and availability of drugs for Alzheimer's disease. Devolution has also brought the postcode lottery to the fore: Scotland plans to provide free personal care for people in residential and care homes, meaning that cost of long-term care for elderly people will be significantly cheaper north of the border. In Wales, fee exemption rules on prescriptions are more liberal, leading to the phenomenon of \"drug runs\" whereby people on the English side of the border drive acrossto stock up on cheaper medicines.</p> <p><strong>Who is most affected by the postcode lottery?</strong><br> Generally speaking, the poorer you are, and the more socially deprived your area, the worse your care and access to it is likely to be. This is known as the \"inverse care law\". Well-off Kingston and Richmond, Surrey, has 50 per cent more GPs than deprived Barnsley, for example. But drug prescribing, and notoriously, abortion services, have been capriciously dependent on the whims, and in some cases, religious beliefs of local doctors, regardless of postcode. And, in the relatively wealthy south-east, shortages of key workers such as nurses mean waiting times for hospital treatment are longer than in less well-off areas in the midlands and the north.</p> <p><strong>How did the postcode lottery come about?</strong><br> The government argues that, since its inception in 1948, there have been no national standards of care in the NHS. For five decades, services grew haphazardly: decisions on which treatments and drugs should be made available were made locally and on an ad-hoc basis by individual health authorities and powerful medical consultants. For many, the epitome of the postcode lottery was GP fundholding, introduced during the internal market of the 1990s. Patients of budget-holding family doctor practices (now replaced with primary care groups and primary care trusts) had faster access to hospital treatment than patients of non-fundholding practices, leading to a two-tier postcode lottery. The concept of a postcode lottery is also a by-product of patients and consumers becoming more aware: patient groups have become more adept at lobbying for their consumer \"rights\" to drugs and services and the well-targeted survey with its shock findings of a \"postcode lottery\" is a key weapon in their campaigning armoury.</p> <p><strong>What is the government going to do about it?</strong><br> In its \"new NHS\" white paper of 1997, ministers promised to \"renew the NHS as a one-nation health service\".

Its provisions cover whether the employee had consented to surveillance, whether there had been consultation with individuals and trade unions and it also establishes the principle of employees being given access to private areas for personal communications, ie a private telephone line. In your case it seems that your line manager is in breach of all of the above legislation by not first informing you that your use of the internet would be monitored. You are therefore within your rights to have your verbal warning wiped from your record. However, that warning does now constitute notification by your line manager of his intention to monitor your internet use. \u0095 Richard Arthur is head of human rights at Thompsons Solicitors.",

Working with the 800 strong staff team, they make a very strong organisation.\" The supporters club also encourages people who wish to pay with the relaunch of the charity's paid membership scheme. However, no one is excluded on the grounds of disposable income and BTCV hopes to encourage participation from those in the most disadvantaged communities. Interest in the scheme has so far been good and Mr Flood says that in the longer term it will be possible to measure whether this way of recognising their gift of time will help retain volunteers. \"Research has highlighted that the reason many people stop volunteering is that no one has thanked them. We hope the Supporters Club will ensure that no BTCV volunteer ever falls into that category.\" \u0095 Contact: Helen Mitchell, PR Manager, BTCV, Tel: 01491 821612, email: H.Mitchell@btcv.org.uk",

      "bodyText": "After a struggle almost as tumultuous as the events it depicted, the Oscar-winning Hollywood film, The Year of Living Dangerously, was screened in Indonesia for the first time last night to a packed house at the second Jakarta International Film Festival. The country's traditionally conservative censors delayed approving the 1982 film - which depicts the bloody fall of Indonesia's first president, Sukarno, in 1965 - until a few hours before the scheduled screening, because the authorities dug their heels in to show they would not be pressured by what they believed was an international conspiracy. Last week an Associated Press report told the world that permission had been given to show the film, which the former president, Suharto, banned because it portrayed the communist movement of the 60s in a far different light from the venomous version he, like his predecessor, had drummed into the population. On Tuesday, festival organisers thought they had the go-ahead when the film was returned to them, though without an authorising letter. This arrived yesterday afternoon, hours before the showing. \"It's been a week of living on the edge,\" said the festival chairman, Shanty Harmayn. \"At times I thought they were going to say no because this has caused such a fuss.\" The screening went ahead despite the censors insisting that some of the slogans on communist banners and a female breast be blurred. \"We don't have a political agenda. This is just a film festival,\" she said. \"We wanted to show it because not many films have been made in Indonesia or about Indonesia.\" It was part of the category, Indonesia Through Foreign Lenses, which also included Punitive Damage, a 1999 film about the Santa Cruz cemetery massacre in East Timor in November 1991.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Patrick Marber is late. When I ring him on his mobile he seems flustered. He's trying to hurry, he says. I have visions of flooded roads, of fallen trees on the line from Guildford, where his production of Pinter's The Caretaker is in its last week of previews. </p> <p>Only later does he admit that actually he was shaving. In his flat around the corner. There is a momentary silence - what a comedy writer like Marber might script as a \"beat\" - before he launches into a fabulously rococo explanation. He was actually trying to do the Guardian a favour. You see, he did a stubbly photo shoot for another newspaper a few days back, and he thought we might want something different. </p> <p>So here he is, smooth-cheeked and corduroy-clad, looking more like Lord Fauntleroy's prosperous older brother than the stand-up turned comedy writer turned author of two of the sharpest plays of the last decade, Dealer's Choice and Closer. </p> <p>Part of the explanation is his dislike of being interviewed. \"I'm still finding out how to give good quote and not reveal a thing,\" he explains. \"It's like being England manager: you have to be so good at handling the media. There's an avalanche of words. I don't want to give a lot away but I also don't want to be a recluse.\" </p> <p>Well, he riffs, part of him does want to be a recluse - the bit that finds showbusiness stressful and would much rather be living in the country with two dogs, perhaps supporting himself with a little light estate management. </p> <p>It is hard to quote Marber without making him sound camp, which he isn't. He is effortlessly funny, but his humour is more Woody Allen than Ned Sherrin. Guilt plays a part in it, which he says may be a Jewish thing. </p> <p>His reluctance to give much away goes hand in hand with a self-lacerating candour: when his poker play, Dealer's Choice, was premiered at the National Theatre in 1995, he let it be known that he had a gambling problem. When Closer spilled its load of cybersex and dysfunction, he said: \"On some level I believe that there's no such thing as an honest relationship: all you can hope for is an honest relationship with yourself.\" </p> <p>On occasions his mouth has got the better of him. In one interview, he pontificated that all comedy was sadistic: \"And I don't think that at all. It was just something I said after a glass of wine in an interview that I was enjoying.\" </p> <p>It's not altogether surprising that the quality he most reveres in The Caretaker is that \"it never fully reveals its meaning but is very clear and accessible. It's wonderfully ambiguous and wonderfully specific at the same time.\" He saw it first at the National when he was in his teens, and it made him realise that theatre was what he wanted to do. </p> <p>Marber's own lean, darkly funny writing has led some to dub him the heir to Pinter, so it seems significant that he has been chosen to direct this 40th-anniversary production of one of Pinter's most beloved plays. </p> <p>Marber scorns the comparison - \"Most younger writers are influenced by Pinter; I'm as much influenced by Stoppard and Oscar Wilde\" - but admires his rigour. \"I'm not really a cavalier,\" he says. \"I think I'm a bit of a roundhead, in that I like things rigorous and shapely. But maybe as I grow up a bit I will become a bit more of a cavalier: my new play is much more anarchic and much less structurally formal than my earlier ones.\" At the moment it has 30 speaking roles, though given his obsession with revision, it may yet end up a monologue. </p> <p>Perhaps equally surprisingly to anyone who has followed his work so far, this new play, slated for the National next summer, is not about city kids getting it on - it's an anxiety comedy about a 50-year-old who ruins his life. It is an exploration of the grandfather Marber never met - his father's father. \"He was much loved. People say I'm a bit like him, and I feel his absence.\" </p> <p>Marber, now 37, was the son of a financial analyst and the elder of two brothers. Growing up in Wimbledon, he soon proved bright and showed a flair for exams, which he attributes to a book his mother once bought him called The Exam Secret: \"It was really a one-page book which said, 'Answer the question', and I stuck to that all my academic life.\" </p> <p>This took him to Oxford, and gained him a slacker's upper second. It was no help at all with writing plays, which he professes to find almost unbearably painful. \"How do I write? By avoiding writing, and I've done brilliantly at avoiding this next play. I've avoided it for three years. You avoid it for so long that guilt takes you over and you think that if you don't write it this year perhaps you'll never write it.\" </p> <p>His girlfriend, actress Debra Gillet, chivvies him along. If it is so painful, why the compulsion to keep doing it? \"If I don't have something on the go I feel, 'What's the point of me?' \" </p> <p>It's not that he has been exactly idle while failing to write this new play. Besides directing his own work - Closer took him from London to Broadway - he has tackled Mamet and now Pinter. He contributed a monologue to a charity anthology edited by Nick Hornby and has seen a screenplay through to rejection. It was an adaptation of Patrick McGrath's novel, Asylum. </p> <p>\"It was very faithful to the book and the book was very bleak. It's not an 'I-got-fucked-over-by-Hollywood' story. They were very nice and perfectly honest about it. I was a little upset until I bumped into Patrick and he really liked it, which was good enough for me.\" </p> <p>So many young English theatre-makers are being wolfed down by Hollywood that it is surprising to find Marber holding out. He has fended off attempts to film his plays, saying he may do it himself one day. </p> <p>Though he made his name in broadcasting, as Steve Coogan's comedy sidekick and co-creator of spoof interviewer Alan Partridge, he is not embarrassed to declare himself a man of the \"old-fart, text-based theatre\". His temperament, he thinks, is better suited to theatre, where you don't have to do everything by committee. </p> <p>Does that mean he's a control freak? \"Oh God, yes. But I don't feel like a freak. If you write something, you have a right to expect your words to be respected. Of course there should be people giving you advice, but you spend a lot of time with those words.\" </p> <p>While he does not have Pinter's punctiliousness with commas and full stops, he is demanding about phrasing and timing. His characters, like Pinter's, don't need to deliver jokes to be funny. He muses that he would like to invent a new symbol of punctuation - perhaps a dash beneath a line - capable of implying a certain wryness, of indicating \"that a character wasn't entirely serious when he spoke this\". So why not go ahead and invent this new form of punctuation? \"Because people would think you were an arse.\" </p> <p>We're back to his peculiar mix of confidence and diffidence, of a will to control and what seems almost like a wish to throw it all away. This is most striking in his relationship with the gaming table. He is a self-confessed gambling addict, yet he flaunts his habit by playing celebrity poker on television. </p> <p>A few days ago, he says, he drove past the flat of the student friend who took him to his first casino. \"I had always felt I was a self-destructive type but I didn't have a self-destructive habit. I didn't drink much or take drugs. I remember thinking that night, as we were playing, 'Oh yeah, this is my vice. This is the thing I've been looking for to ruin my life.' \" </p> <p>When he began to find that cards were all he thought about, he took himself along to Gamblers Anonymous. \"I was in trouble, in an adolescent sort of way. Now I'm like an alcoholic who has a drink. I'm playing a dangerous game but I have certain structures in my life - a relationship, my own property, and royalties.\" </p> <p>Besides poker, he plays blackjack. It is what professional gamblers call their \"leak\": the game of chance that takes all your winnings off you. \"I've greatly increased my stake over the years,\" he says, cheerfully. To what sort of level? \"Oh, I couldn't say: that would be vulgar. But it's an amount that hurts when you lose it.\" </p> <p>This is surely a terrible incautiousness for a man who describes his own mind as inquiring but cautious, who likes to keep control. Perhaps the excitement of poker has something in common with the impulse that keeps him writing his plays. \"I find it incredibly difficult, but once a month you get a moment of joy when you find something you didn't know was there.\" Life, to misquote Pinter, is funny up to a point. After that, it's not funny at all. </p> <p>\u0095 The Caretaker is in previews and opens at the Comedy Theatre, London SW1 (020-7369 1731), next Wednesday.</p>",

I didn't drink much or take drugs. I remember thinking that night, as we were playing, 'Oh yeah, this is my vice. This is the thing I've been looking for to ruin my life.' \" When he began to find that cards were all he thought about, he took himself along to Gamblers Anonymous. \"I was in trouble, in an adolescent sort of way. Now I'm like an alcoholic who has a drink. I'm playing a dangerous game but I have certain structures in my life - a relationship, my own property, and royalties.\" Besides poker, he plays blackjack. It is what professional gamblers call their \"leak\": the game of chance that takes all your winnings off you. \"I've greatly increased my stake over the years,\" he says, cheerfully. To what sort of level? \"Oh, I couldn't say: that would be vulgar. But it's an amount that hurts when you lose it.\" This is surely a terrible incautiousness for a man who describes his own mind as inquiring but cautious, who likes to keep control. Perhaps the excitement of poker has something in common with the impulse that keeps him writing his plays. \"I find it incredibly difficult, but once a month you get a moment of joy when you find something you didn't know was there.\" Life, to misquote Pinter, is funny up to a point. After that, it's not funny at all. \u0095 The Caretaker is in previews and opens at the Comedy Theatre, London SW1 (020-7369 1731), next Wednesday.",

      "body": "<p>There is something incontrovertibly sad about remainder bookshops. After all the hype - the big advances, the newspaper serialisation, the interviews, the signings, the readings, the appearance on Radio 4's Midweek or Woman's Hour - even the best of writers can find themselves consigned to cut-price corner. </p> <p>While, for the book-reading public, remainder stores represent something approaching good value; for the writer, after the gargantuan effort that has gone into the creation of a book, to see it slashed in price from \u00a320 to \u00a34.99 and heaped high alongside copies of Rude Food, Ken Hom's cookery course and cheap art books must be utterly crushing. </p> <p>At this stage in the day it may be hard to whip up sympathy for Anthea Turner, but Fools Rush In, her recently published autobiography, which was serialised with gusto in the Daily Mail, and followed up on the pages of many other newspapers, looks as though it may be heading for the remainders' shelves sooner than expected. </p> <p>It emerged last week that Fools Rush In had sold a grand total of 451 copies in its first week and had entered the bestseller chart at number 531. Until now figures have been readily available through BookTrack, which monitors sales for the publishing industry. </p> <p>But last week, after Turner's poor performance was gleefully picked up by the media, publishers met with BookTrack and an agreement was reached that figures for sales outside the top 100 should not be released in response to ad hoc inquiries. In other words, publishers are quite happy to tell us all about their success stories but are a little less candid about their failures. Of which, of course, there are far, far more. </p> <p>Turner's publishers Little Brown paid an estimated \u00a3400,000 for her story. Last week they must have been watching David Beckham's success enviously as he found himself at the top of the hardback non-fiction bestseller list, shifting 4,726 copies of his glossy autobiography My World, bringing total sales to 15,235. </p> <p>Likewise Martine McCutcheon's Who Does She Think She Is? was high in the bestseller list at number four, selling 3,375 copies last week (8,051 overall); Terry Wogan's Is It Me? sold 2,823 (24,392 overall), putting him at number eight, and at number nine, Barbara Windsor sold 2,711 (15,289 overall) copies of All of Me. </p> <p>Such success stories are, however, comparatively rare in the publishing world. According to booksellers Waterstones, about 15% of all books bought by shops are returned to the publishers. In the case of Turner it is likely to be far more, possibly 50%. Many of those are then bought by remainder bookshops who sell them at hugely discounted prices. </p> <p>On sale at The Works, a leading remainders bookshop in Camden High Street, London, last week were some of the casualties of the publishing industry, some high profile, others less well known. </p> <p>There was Jeremy Beadle's Watch Out, reduced from \u00a315.99 to \u00a31; The New Alan Titchmarsh was on sale at \u00a34.99, reduced from \u00a316.99 and Norman Lamont's In Office, published amid much excitement last year, was on sale at \u00a34.99, rather less than the original \u00a320. </p> <p>Getting publishers to talk about their flops is not easy. They are infernally optimistic. Martin Nield, managing director of Hodder &amp; Stoughton, was one of the few prepared to admit to disaster, though for him it was a matter of bad luck rather than poor judgement. </p> <p>\"We published the Will Carling autobiography. Everyone was right behind it. There was a huge serialisation deal in place,\" Nield explains. It all looked very promising until Carling left his partner Ali Cockayne and their baby son, amid much negative publicity. \"It could not have been worse timing. The sales dropped stone dead. Lots went into the book shops, but it hardly sold at all.\" </p> <p>More recently, Charlie Dimmock's Enjoy Your Garden failed to match expectation, despite a major serialisation and plenty of hype. Nicholas Clee, editor of the Bookseller, says: \"After they had done so well with Jamie Oliver, they thought Charlie Dimmock would do the same thing for gardening, but I'm not sure it was a huge hit.\" </p> <p>Dimmock's publisher Michael Joseph admits to being disappointed: \"It did extremely well in book clubs, in the real mass market, but it did not do so well in conventional bookshops. But we controlled serial rights, so from a financial point of view we are all right,\" one insider confesses. </p> <p>Often serial rights are controlled by the author and her literary agent, which means that all the proceeds from a newspaper serialisation go to them rather than the publisher, as in the case of the Turner book, which was sold for \u00a3250,000 to the Daily Mail. Not a penny went to Little Brown. However, the six-figure sum paid by the Mail on Sunday for the Dimmock serialisation went to Michael Joseph, taking the sting out of the expensive advance. </p> <p>So do newspaper serialisations help to sell books? Sometimes? Always? Or can a major serialisation satisfy the public's interest and destroy sales? \"It is a way of alerting the public - a public which does not usually buy books - that this book is out there,\" says one publisher. </p> <p>It did not work for the Nick Leeson book, Rogue Trader, also published by Little Brown which paid \u00a3450,000 for the story. It did not sell well despite a prominent serialisation in the Daily Mail and all the concurrent hype and publicity. </p> <p>\"You've got to be a national treasure. There has to be a great deal of affection, which is why you can see Terry Wogan working so well, or Dickie Bird,\" says Hodder's Nield. Leeson hardly fits into the national treasure category either. Likewise Anthea Turner. </p> <p>\"We turned down Anthea Turner,\" one relieved publisher confessed last week. \"It does not surprise me at all that that book has not sold. She's a C-list celebrity who has hardly done anything in her life. She's not glamorous. I'm flabbergasted they paid \u00a3400,000. There are some people who fascinate the public, and others who do not. Anthea Turner was absolutely the wrong horse to back.\" </p> <p>Alan Samson, editorial director of Turner's publisher, Little Brown, and a veteran of celebrity books (Cher, Whoopi Goldberg and the Spice Girls), sounded as if he were in deep shock last week. He insisted that she had sold far more than 451, but added: \"The vilification Anthea has had has definitely had an effect so far in sales, but the book is not lost yet. </p> <p>But while David Beckham, Terry Wogan, Martine McCutcheon and Barbara Windsor are tramping up and down the country, appearing at bookshops and signing endless copies of their books (apparently it makes good sense to sign as many books as possible as unsold signed copies cannot be returned to publishers, according to Lynda Lee-Potter, who is also on the publicity trail flogging her book Class Act), Turner will be keeping an uncharacteristically low profile. There will be no book signings, no publicity tour, no readings or public appearances. </p> <p>\"At the moment there's no point,\" says Samson. \"Whatever Anthea does at the moment will be turned against her. If she dived into the Thames to save a drowning dog, people would say it's a stunt by her publishers.\" </p> <p>There are always going to be books - high-profile or otherwise - that don't sell. Last year 109,000 books were launched in the UK, that's about 2,000 a week on average. Most do not sell. If there is a lesson to be drawn from Turner's disastrous book, it is this - never believe anyone who claims there is no such thing as bad publicity. There clearly is. </p> <p>And when you are wandering around your local remainders store, fingering sad little piles of Fools Rush In, remember it could be worse. The real disasters are pulped.</p>",

He then just faxed it out to all the regional newspapers. Although it was the obvious thing to do, we were still surprised by how many ended up printing it.\" Pitfall: unwanted press conferences \"We held a press conference on the same issue one morning. We turned down requests for radio interviews beforehand to keep the story as fresh as possible. In the end, we did not get much coverage from the conference. Since then we have always asked ourselves: Do we need to hold a press conference? 'What new angle does a press conference give the story? What will a journalist get from a conference which they cannot get from written briefings or a quick telephone call?\" Mark Scothern, director, Derby Council for Voluntary Services Tip: use personal and individual experiences \"We approached the local paper about increasing coverage for the voluntary sector. The editor agreed to print first person pieces written by individuals about their experiences of volunteering.\" Pitfall: unwanted opinions \"In the past, we had a column in the local paper. But the public does not want to read the views of the voluntary sector. This was just social policy analysis. They want to hear real stories from real people. They want to hear how the voluntary sector makes a difference to real people's lives.\"",

William Thomas Nevell was born in Balham, south London, on June 13, 1916, and died in Worthing, Sussex, on Aug 25, 1978. He was a hard-hitting tailend batsman, and a fast-medium bowler who played a little for Middlesex (1936-38), Surrey (1939) and Northamptonshire (1946-47). In all he appeared in 51 first-class matches, scoring 671 runs and taking 105 wickets. He did indeed get Bradman out at Lord's in 1938. The match was played on May 30-31, and Bradman had achieved the rare feat of reaching 1000 first-class runs before the end of May in the previous game, at Southampton (typically, Bradman is the only player to have done this twice: he also managed it in 1930). According to BJ Wakley's book \"Bradman the Great\", a monumental piece of research which gives great detail on all The Don's innings, in that match at Lord's Bradman \"gave an uncharacteristic display, being missed at long leg off Nevell when 0, off a wild heave, before being well caught [for 5] off another crude stroke, Denis Compton running across from slip to catch a nasty skyer at short leg\".</p> <p> <strong> Can you tell me the England squad for the 1996 World Cup?</strong> asks Wayne Trott</p> <p>The squad was: Mike Atherton (captain), Alec Stewart (vice-captain), Robin Smith, Graeme Hick, Graham Thorpe, Neil Fairbrother, Jack Russell, Craig White, Dominic Cork, Phillip DeFreitas, Neil Smith, Richard Illingworth, Darren Gough and Peter Martin.

It wasn't a happy tour: one of the strongest of all Australian sides, captained by the formidable Warwick Armstrong, won all five Tests. Oddly, Douglas had also taken over the captaincy of the previous Ashes tour, in 1911-12.

Fears are growing that too little is being done to tackle the estimated 10 million households that are expected to resist the switch from analogue to digital TV. ITN shareholders have put flotation plans on hold, pending the publication of the forthcoming broadcasting white paper. The BBC has signed its first exclusive deal with television presenter Jonathan Ross. The appointment of a new chair for the Broadcasting Standards Commission has been held up following the Department for Culture, Media &amp; Sport's decision this week to advertise the post externally. Kelvin MacKenzie's Wireless Group is making its first move into television, joining forces with indie 3BM TV to produce sports documentaries.",

BT will also spin off up to 25% of its BT Wireless mobile phone operation, a similar percentage of Yell, its the Yellow Pages directories arm, and make progress towards listing BT Ignite, its internet business. Chief executive Sir Peter Bonfield said the reshaping was \"no less dramatic in its way than the original privatisation (of BT) back in 1984\". The partial flotation of BT Wireless, which includes BT Cellnet, will take place in the second half of next year and that of Yell by the end of this financial year. BT Ignite will be in a position to be floated off by the end of 2001. As part of the proposals a new holding company will also be created called BT Group. The changes meant BT would continue to see productivity improvements, including reductions in its workforce, said Sir Peter. \"We've already exceeded our target of 3,000 for the reduction of management and more than 5,000 people will have left the business by the end of this year,\" he said. BT hopes to have reduced its debt by about \u00a310bn by December 2001 from a combination of its disposals and the partial flotations. The precise shape of NetCo had yet to be defined and discussions would take place about this with the government and telecoms regulator Oftel, he added. Once this was achieved, BT would look to partially float off this business too, spinning off 25% as a separately listed company. The new company would be able to focus solely on meeting the needs of licensed operators and service providers, including BT Retail and BT Ignite. There would also be no conflict between it and the rest of BT, said Sir Peter.

In the minds of many patients, doctors and members of the pharmaceutical industry, it has become synonymous with health care rationing. This reputation for parsimony may be unwarranted, however. Rather than capping spending, it may be inflating it. An analysis of the 15 Nice reports published by the end of October 2000 shows its guidance has added a net extra cost to the NHS of \u00a3155.7m a year. The widespread perception of Nice as a rationer springs from its first published guidance in autumn 1999 - a rapid assessment of the effectiveness of the drug Relenza. Some studies have shown Relenza can reduce the duration of flu by 24 hours if taken within 48 hours of the appearance of the symptoms. But Nice decided that there was insufficient information on the clinical effectiveness of the pill because the trials used only small numbers of patients. The institute advised doctors not to prescribe it. Relenza would have cost at least \u00a315m a year. But an examination of the guidance shows that Nice, whose members are drawn from the clinical professions, academics, health economists and patients groups, is attempting to steer a path between clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness and this does not always mean rationing. The institute has said that the health service should not issue digital hearing aids until further research has been carried out. Even so, its report on hearing aids called for the widespread availability of analogue devices, which could cost the NHS an extra \u00a350m a year. Some of the institute's less well known guidance will significantly increase costs. Its backing of methylphenidate for the treatment of hyperactive children will cost \u00a344m. The availability of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), which monitor and control heartbeat, for heart attack victims or patients with irregular heartbeats, could cost \u00a335m a year. Nice produces an estimate of the financial impact of its guidance in each report and an analysis of the 15 reports published by the end of October 2000 shows a net extra cost to the NHS of \u00a3185.7m a year. In fact, NHS costs should rise as a result of the guidance despite arguments that NHS budgets are increasing at a much greater rate than Nice-related spending inflation. There is some concern that in key areas such as cancer, which are increasingly made up of ring-fenced budgets, Nice guidance will encourage spending on some treatments but rationing of drugs and therapies in others. This fear was highlighted recently in a survey of cancer specialists in all 143 NHS oncology units in the wake of a decision by Nice that taxanes - drugs for breast and ovarian cancer - should be made widely available at a potential additional cost of \u00a323m a year. A pressure group, the Campaign for Effective and Rational Treatment (Cert), found that one in nine health authorities and health boards believed they would have to reduce spending on drugs for other types of tumour to pay for the increased use of taxanes. One in three could not find the money to pay for the drugs. However, Professor Mike Richards, director of the NHS cancer programme, said the survey was \"complete rubbish\". \"Everybody who should be treated with taxanes is receiving them. We have contacted all the NHS trusts and health authorities in the Cert survey. They have all told us that in fact they are not having any problems.\"",

      "byline": "Linda Steele",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Social work recruitment is in crisis. With a vacancy rate of around 16% in England who could disagree? Well, maybe Paula Stott. Stott, a training manager for Suffolk county council, thinks that a little lateral thinking is needed. After all, the solution to what seems an intractable problem is sometimes right under your nose.</p> <p>\"There may be a recruitment crisis in terms of new recruits,\" acknowledges Stott. \"But we need to grow our own.\"</p> <p>In Suffolk, a homegrown social worker pilot began in spring 1999. The council, with town hall union Unison and Ruskin College, Oxford, set up an inhouse diploma in social work (DipSW) for social care employees who want to become qualified social workers.</p> <p>Eighteen staff do their usual jobs four days a week. Then, once a week, they attend a county training centre to learn social work theory from council trainers and social work lecturers, including a Ruskin tutor. (Ruskin is responsible for academic standards.) As with full-time diplomas, students undertake a 50-day and an 80-day placement.</p> <p>The council pays the students' fees and travel costs. Taking into account \u00a378,000 higher education funding council money over three years, the scheme is setting Suffolk back roughly \u00a3780 per student per year, excluding cover.</p> <p><strong>Nitty-gritty</strong></p> <p>One hundred and fifty staff applied for the inhouse DipSW scheme and 40 were \"ideal\", according to Stott. \"I suspect that it's the same nationally. It's not that people don't want to be social workers but training is not being offered in a way that meets their needs. All these people wanted passionately to be a social worker and they knew the nitty-gritty reality of being a social worker.\"</p> <p>Social work students tend to be older than the average undergraduate. And it's tough - if not impossible - to give up your job and go off to study for two years for a DipSW.</p> <p>Paul Davis, an assessment officer for deaf people and one of the 18 Suffolk students, agrees. \"Qualifying as a social worker was really a natural progression from what I'm doing now. I looked into doing it but, quite frankly, I couldn't have undertaken the financial commitment.\"</p> <p>Giles Darvill, from the National Institute for Social Work, who is evaluating the course on behalf of Unison and the Central Council for Education and Training in Social Work, says the early signs are good. \"The measurable objectives were very good - at least as good as the full-time course.\"</p> <p>But he warns that it is not as simple as chopping a full-time course into smaller pieces and serving them up to staff on a day-release basis. \"You can't just colonise the workplace with academic courses.\" The students \"have much more social care experience that most full timers\" and that should be taken into account. (The partnership is revising the course and considering an Accrediting Prior Experience and Learning (APEL) scheme.)</p> <p>\"It will still be useful to separate off special periods, away from the normal workbase and under the guidance of practice teachers. But it would also be appropriate to use all the students' work experience for study and guidance, linking theory to practice throughout the course, with an extended role for the practice teacher throughout, and a clearer contribution from the line manager to the students learning via supervision,\" says Darvill.</p> <p><strong>Souped-up role</strong></p> <p>That sounds fine - but it's not so easy to achieve. \"One or two managers have found it a bit of a challenge because it's a dual role to have someone who's both a worker and a student. Also, not all have the ability to work positively with staff whose confidence and intellectual ability are expanding,\" admits Stott.</p> <p>When a longtime employee suddenly comes in, full of ideas and wanting to make changes, it can be threatening to a minority. So that's where Darvill's vision of a souped-up role for social work practice teachers, supporting students in their usual jobs, comes in.</p> <p>It's this potential symbiosis of learning and practice, and its effect on the workplace culture, that those involved consider one of the most gratifying aspects of the Suffolk pilot. It has not been without its problems. But the enthusiasm and growing knowledge of the students feeds into their work and rubs off on their colleagues, says Stott.</p> <p>The government's recent social care quality strategy called on social services departments to become \"learning organisations\". Almost as if by magic, Suffolk has become one.</p>",

After all, the solution to what seems an intractable problem is sometimes right under your nose. \"There may be a recruitment crisis in terms of new recruits,\" acknowledges Stott. \"But we need to grow our own.\" In Suffolk, a homegrown social worker pilot began in spring 1999. The council, with town hall union Unison and Ruskin College, Oxford, set up an inhouse diploma in social work (DipSW) for social care employees who want to become qualified social workers. Eighteen staff do their usual jobs four days a week. Then, once a week, they attend a county training centre to learn social work theory from council trainers and social work lecturers, including a Ruskin tutor. (Ruskin is responsible for academic standards.) As with full-time diplomas, students undertake a 50-day and an 80-day placement. The council pays the students' fees and travel costs. Taking into account \u00a378,000 higher education funding council money over three years, the scheme is setting Suffolk back roughly \u00a3780 per student per year, excluding cover. Nitty-gritty One hundred and fifty staff applied for the inhouse DipSW scheme and 40 were \"ideal\", according to Stott. \"I suspect that it's the same nationally. It's not that people don't want to be social workers but training is not being offered in a way that meets their needs. All these people wanted passionately to be a social worker and they knew the nitty-gritty reality of being a social worker.\" Social work students tend to be older than the average undergraduate. And it's tough - if not impossible - to give up your job and go off to study for two years for a DipSW. Paul Davis, an assessment officer for deaf people and one of the 18 Suffolk students, agrees. \"Qualifying as a social worker was really a natural progression from what I'm doing now. I looked into doing it but, quite frankly, I couldn't have undertaken the financial commitment.\" Giles Darvill, from the National Institute for Social Work, who is evaluating the course on behalf of Unison and the Central Council for Education and Training in Social Work, says the early signs are good. \"The measurable objectives were very good - at least as good as the full-time course.\" But he warns that it is not as simple as chopping a full-time course into smaller pieces and serving them up to staff on a day-release basis. \"You can't just colonise the workplace with academic courses.\" The students \"have much more social care experience that most full timers\" and that should be taken into account. (The partnership is revising the course and considering an Accrediting Prior Experience and Learning (APEL) scheme.) \"It will still be useful to separate off special periods, away from the normal workbase and under the guidance of practice teachers. But it would also be appropriate to use all the students' work experience for study and guidance, linking theory to practice throughout the course, with an extended role for the practice teacher throughout, and a clearer contribution from the line manager to the students learning via supervision,\" says Darvill. Souped-up role That sounds fine - but it's not so easy to achieve. \"One or two managers have found it a bit of a challenge because it's a dual role to have someone who's both a worker and a student. Also, not all have the ability to work positively with staff whose confidence and intellectual ability are expanding,\" admits Stott. When a longtime employee suddenly comes in, full of ideas and wanting to make changes, it can be threatening to a minority. So that's where Darvill's vision of a souped-up role for social work practice teachers, supporting students in their usual jobs, comes in. It's this potential symbiosis of learning and practice, and its effect on the workplace culture, that those involved consider one of the most gratifying aspects of the Suffolk pilot. It has not been without its problems. But the enthusiasm and growing knowledge of the students feeds into their work and rubs off on their colleagues, says Stott. The government's recent social care quality strategy called on social services departments to become \"learning organisations\". Almost as if by magic, Suffolk has become one.",

I had a history of psychiatric illness.</p> <p>I have since advised all service users and friends to follow this example. Having been a chief executive for 16 years, I have no doubts about the existence of discrimination. It is very simple.

Any job. </p> <p>Only after you have done a job well do they discover that you can do it at all. The discrimination will be for the best of reasons. Employers will tell themselves that these jobs are very stressful and that someone with my history should not be put under that sort of stress.</p> <p>At the same time, of course, the NHS wants to give the \"customer\" what the customer wants.

      "bodyText": "When I joined the NHS in 1973 I lied on my application form. I lied at interview. At my first promotion I lied on the application form and at interview. And I lied at my second promotion. Only after my third appointment was offered to me, and before accepting, did I see my prospective boss and tell him the truth. I had a history of psychiatric illness. I have since advised all service users and friends to follow this example. Having been a chief executive for 16 years, I have no doubts about the existence of discrimination. It is very simple. If you tell the truth, that you have been in a psychiatric hospital or had psychiatric treatment, no one is going to presume that you can do a job. Any job. Only after you have done a job well do they discover that you can do it at all. The discrimination will be for the best of reasons. Employers will tell themselves that these jobs are very stressful and that someone with my history should not be put under that sort of stress. At the same time, of course, the NHS wants to give the \"customer\" what the customer wants. It wants to \"value\" the customer without actually valuing the customer's experience as a useful attribute in the workforce. Invaluable resource This causes a major dysfunction in the service. It is estimated that 50% of women of working age will suffer from depression. As the NHS workforce is 70% female, this means that at least 35% of our workforce will be affected. In the case of of the 30% of the workforce made up of men, 25% of those suffer from depression. This means an additional 7.5% needs to be added to the female 35% to make a total of 42.5%. This invaluable resource of workers with personal experience of mental health problems is buried. The professional press is not swamped with advertisements for \"psychiatrists, preferably with experience as a user\" or \"psychologists with personal experience of treatment\" or \"nurses with a psychiatric history\".

Students are also encouraged to take language notes, to observe and evaluate different presentation styles, to give critical feedback to the presenters.

There is also a strong focus on presentation skills, social English and effective language learning strategies. To prepare our students for the workshops with business school lecturers we have devised a wide range of study and practice activities focusing on high-frequency language connected with the topic. Before coming to the seminar participants are required to do preparatory reading and listening activities related to the various topics. They also have to indicate beforehand which topic they would feel most confident giving a talk on. The sessions run by the business school are designed as hands-on workshops where, for example, students devise and present a future scenario plan for their line of business, after receiving input on the topic. The role of the language trainer during these sessions is to act as consultant, helping out when there are breakdowns in communication, taking notes for feedback sessions. Students are also encouraged to take language notes, to observe and evaluate different presentation styles, to give critical feedback to the presenters. Trainers are expected to know their stuff, but inevitably they cannot always answer students' highly technical questions. Here the role of the trainer is to help to formulate the questions that are then put to the experts the following day. The programme is rounded off with company visits, evenings with MBA students, and the inevitable pub outings socialising with trainers and guest speakers. The overwhelming response from our students is that we should be offering more seminars like this that incorporate a wider range of skills. Having participated in Language And our managers return to their desks not only feeling more confident about their language skills but also better informed about key issues affecting their work lives, and perhaps also with new perspectives on their roles as managers. \u0095 Andy Hewitson is head of English language training at Siemens. He will be one of the presenters at the 13th International Association of English Language Teaching's Business English Special Interest Group International Conference at Siemens' training centre in Munich, Germany, from November 17-19.

State tests showed dramatic academic gains for Spanish-speaking students in reading and writing - especially in the early grades, where we had reduced class size to 20 or fewer students and implemented phonics reading instruction. Those changes seemed to have made a difference. But Proposition 227 has been the catalyst for the dramatic changes in student achievement. Without it we would have been teaching these students in Spanish; they would certainly have performed poorly on the state tests, which are administered in English.

      "body": "<p>Since 1998 the English Language Teaching Improvement Project (ELTIP) has been working in Bangladesh to expand the country's communicative English language teaching syllabus, through textbook and examination reform and in-service teacher training (Inset). Jointly funded by the Bangladeshi and British governments, providing $1.6m and $4.3m respectively, ELTIP has seven British consultants working with about 50 local trainers and support staff. </p> <p> Six months ago project staff were pessimistic about the future of the unique training programmes developed by ELTIP. A remote central government appeared uninterested in the project, and there was little expectation that it would achieve its target of sustainability after 2001, when funding runs out. Today the future of the project's work looks much brighter. The Bangladeshi education ministry has agreed to use it as a model for future Inset training, and the project's regional English language specialists will be employed by the ministry as ELT trainers. So why are ministers now so keen to appropriate a project which, like many other donor-sponsored initiatives, could easily have been shunted into obscurity? The answer lies in the strong \"ownership\" policy that ELTIP has promoted at grassroots level.</p> <p>At the centre of this policy is the formation of clusters of schools to procure ELT training via district education officers. Before ELTIP provides training the three or four schools in each cluster must agree on certain conditions: the head teachers must promise full support for follow-up work, they must allow teachers to go to refresher courses, and they must let them form discussion and support groups. </p> <p> The result has been to involve head teachers and district officers directly in the management of staff development. At the Residential Model college in Dhaka the principal, Colonel Kaiser, like many other head teachers, is taking the initiative in training. He has organised more workshop training for his teachers and other schools in the cluster.</p> <p>Professor Sawkat Ali, head of Lamatia Government Girls' School in Dhaka, talks of a \"revolution\" in teaching methods as a result of the training. \"The pupils actually like the lessons,\" he said. Meanwhile teachers elsewhere are requesting workshops on specific skills such as vocabulary teaching, and have set up informal gatherings that range from women's discussion groups to film nights.</p> <p> As the project has gained momentum, the enthusiasm from teachers has contrasted with a lack of interest in government circles. ELTIP staff, who have found it difficult to engage with ministry officials from the outset, believe that the rapid growth of the project took the government by surprise. In an environment where progress is usually slow, staff found that officials had not started to implement proper recruitment procedures and financial practices.</p> <p>The project also had to overcome the underlying problem of the country's unresolved language policy. In the past language has been literally a matter of life and death. The 1971 war of independence with Pakistan, in which 3m Bengali speakers died, is also referred to as \"the language war\". State planners take a cautious approach to language policy, and there is an unresolved debate about what role English should have, and its place in the syllabus.

      "bodyText": "Since 1998 the English Language Teaching Improvement Project (ELTIP) has been working in Bangladesh to expand the country's communicative English language teaching syllabus, through textbook and examination reform and in-service teacher training (Inset). Jointly funded by the Bangladeshi and British governments, providing $1.6m and $4.3m respectively, ELTIP has seven British consultants working with about 50 local trainers and support staff. Six months ago project staff were pessimistic about the future of the unique training programmes developed by ELTIP. A remote central government appeared uninterested in the project, and there was little expectation that it would achieve its target of sustainability after 2001, when funding runs out. Today the future of the project's work looks much brighter. The Bangladeshi education ministry has agreed to use it as a model for future Inset training, and the project's regional English language specialists will be employed by the ministry as ELT trainers. So why are ministers now so keen to appropriate a project which, like many other donor-sponsored initiatives, could easily have been shunted into obscurity? The answer lies in the strong \"ownership\" policy that ELTIP has promoted at grassroots level. At the centre of this policy is the formation of clusters of schools to procure ELT training via district education officers. Before ELTIP provides training the three or four schools in each cluster must agree on certain conditions: the head teachers must promise full support for follow-up work, they must allow teachers to go to refresher courses, and they must let them form discussion and support groups. The result has been to involve head teachers and district officers directly in the management of staff development. At the Residential Model college in Dhaka the principal, Colonel Kaiser, like many other head teachers, is taking the initiative in training. He has organised more workshop training for his teachers and other schools in the cluster. Professor Sawkat Ali, head of Lamatia Government Girls' School in Dhaka, talks of a \"revolution\" in teaching methods as a result of the training. \"The pupils actually like the lessons,\" he said. Meanwhile teachers elsewhere are requesting workshops on specific skills such as vocabulary teaching, and have set up informal gatherings that range from women's discussion groups to film nights. As the project has gained momentum, the enthusiasm from teachers has contrasted with a lack of interest in government circles. ELTIP staff, who have found it difficult to engage with ministry officials from the outset, believe that the rapid growth of the project took the government by surprise. In an environment where progress is usually slow, staff found that officials had not started to implement proper recruitment procedures and financial practices. The project also had to overcome the underlying problem of the country's unresolved language policy. In the past language has been literally a matter of life and death. The 1971 war of independence with Pakistan, in which 3m Bengali speakers died, is also referred to as \"the language war\". State planners take a cautious approach to language policy, and there is an unresolved debate about what role English should have, and its place in the syllabus. Over the past five months, however, government officials have undergone a change in attitude towards ELTIP and the ELT curriculum, thanks to a ministerial review of the project in May. The review, ordered by the education minister partly as a result of pressure to extend the project, was led by Sirajul Haq Talukder, the ministry's senior assistant chief of planning. \"I have seen with my own eyes and listened to the evidence of teachers, head teachers and district officers,\" he said after his tour of remote areas to meet stakeholders in the project. His list of recommendations outlines what action must be taken to support the project officially and to integrate its structure into ministry training. The review has also galvanised government officials into finding ways to \"own\" the activities of the project, and officials are liaising closely with project staff to map out recruitment and budgeting. This change in fortunes for ELTIP is proof that in any democracy grassroots opinion is a powerful tool for change.

      "bodyText": "Gordon Brown yesterday sought to appease angry protests by hauliers, farmers and motorists with a \u00a32bn package of cuts in road taxes and fuel. The self-styled people's fuel lobby said it planned to go ahead with its march on London, but Mr Brown's efforts to head off an early resumption of September's protests clearly drove a wedge among the drivers' ranks, with renewed pressure on them to call off their campaign. The chancellor appeared to have bought the government a significant breathing space with his pre-Budget package that would cut hauliers' costs by the equivalent of 8p a litre and those of motorists by 4p from March. Mr Brown, who froze fuel duty last year, said the freeze would continue in his next Budget - against an inflation-driven 1.5p rise - and for a further year if oil prices remained high. The freeze applies to the \"red\" diesel used by farmers. The duty on ultra low sulphur petrol will be cut by a further 2p a litre in the next budget, bringing the total to 3p - with the same cut now to be made in the same form of diesel. There will be a 2p cut in duty on lead replacement petrol in this \u00a31bn package. Drivers of cars such as the Ford Escort, VW Polo and Honda Civic will pay \u00a3100 for their annual road tax compared with the current \u00a3155. The chancellor extended the lower duty to cars between 1200cc and 1500cc. Mr Brown hopes that these measures will peel off motorists from hauliers, who initially wanted a 26.2p cut in the price of a litre of diesel. Several leading protesters among the hauliers who blockaded oil refineries in September dismissed the concessions as mere tokens, while others welcomed them or said they needed more time to consider a complex package. David Handley, chairman of the people's fuel lobby, which led the revolt in September, said the planned day of disruption would go ahead. \"We will be in London on the 14th. The protest goes ahead ... by the time this gets implemented we will go out of business.\" Even the official lobbies, the road hauliers association and the freight transport association, split apart, with the RHA saying it needed instant relief and the FTA acknowledging that the government had listened to its pleas. Mr Brown set out a \u00a3750m package for hauliers which included a 50% cut in vehicle excise duty for lorries worth up to \u00a34,000 for each vehicle and the reduction of the current 100 rates or bands to just seven from his March budget. The chancellor said this would cost \u00a3300m a year while it would cost an extra \u00a3265m to rebate vehicle excise duty fees for this financial year, with full payments due by the end of January. But he made plain these were consultative proposals which would, if implemented, save the owners of 250,000 lorries \u00a32,000 and an average \u00a31,750 per trucker for the whole industry.

      "bodyText": "The government yesterday courted the votes of motorists and environmentalists with a \u00a31.5bn package of measures to encourage drivers to switch to greener fuels and cut the cost of motoring. The duty on both ultra-low sulphur petrol and diesel will be cut by 3p a litre from the next Budget while existing duties for all forms of fuel will be frozen at their current levels. They would have gone up 1.5p a litre in March. A further 5.4m car owners will pay \u00a355 a year less for their vehicle excise duty as the chancellor Gordon Brown will extend the \u00a3100 fee to all cars under 1500cc - backdated to this month. But the chancellor's efforts to please Escort Man and Polo Woman as well as the green lobby came with a sting in the tail - the cuts in duty on greener petrol depend on the oil companies making it available. So far ultra-low sulphur petrol can be bought at just 800 of Britain's 12,500 forecourts, including 600 in Scotland. But the chancellor said the switch to the same form of diesel had been achieved in two years - and the oil companies, led by Shell, said it would be available nationwide by the spring. But the AA, which welcomed the overall package, said it was not convinced that the industry would be able to produce enough ultra-low sulphur petrol. The chancellor said his measures were worth \u00a31.5bn to motorists - equivalent to a 4p cut in duty in real terms or 1p more than that offered so far by the Conservatives. John Dawson, AA policy director, said Mr Brown was \"returning much of the \u00a33bn in windfall tax receipts that he has available from higher than expected oil prices.\" Michael Meacher, environment minister, said the 10p a litre rise in the price of oil in the past two years had \"done our environmental work for us\" while the overall package would benefit poorer and rural people. Mr Brown sought further to enhance his green credentials by offering \"major\" cuts in duty in his next budget for alternative fuels such as diesel made from oil seed rape or hybrid cars using hydrogen-powered fuel cells. Drivers who take their colleagues to work or on company business will be repaid 2p a mile for every passenger they carry while smaller works buses will qualify for tax exemptions. Even cyclists benefit, with VAT for helmets abolished and the mileage rate for bikes used on business trips raised from 12p to 20p a mile. Car drivers should enjoy a uniform mileage rate, irrespective of the size of car, from 2002. But several green lobby groups regretted the freezing of petrol/diesel prices. Mark Crawford, chief economist with the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, said he believed that the measures would do nothing to combat climate change. What is Ultra-low sulphur fuel? Ultra-low sulphur petrol (ULSP) could soon outsell standard unleaded thanks to yesterday's tax cut. It can be used in any car that takes unleaded and produces less sulphur dioxide. It helps to prolong the life and efficiency of catalytic converters, which reduce carbon dioxide, hydrocarbon and nitrogen oxide emissions. It claims to enable manufacturers to increase the fuel efficiency of cars. Fewer than 1,000 of the 12,500 petrol retailers across Britain stock ULSP at present.

      "bodyText": "Gordon Brown yesterday unveiled concessions worth up to \u00a34.7bn next year as he sought to appease pensioners and fuel protesters without throwing away his hard-won reputation for fiscal prudence. Concentrating his efforts on the elderly, the chancellor exploited the buoyant state of the government's finances to announce a \u00a35 a week rise in the basic pension for a single person - more than double the rate of inflation - and \u00a38 a week for a married couple. Within hours of presenting his pre-budget report to MPs, Mr Brown appeared to have succeeded in defusing anger among pensioner groups over the 75p a week increase in the basic pension for this year. However, his olive branch to road hauliers - consultations on a \u00a31.75bn series of measures that would cut fuel prices, reduce excise duty and provide subsidies for \"greener\" lorries - was dismissed as an insult by protesters' leaders. Mr Brown announced his proposals six days before the expiry of the 60-day deadline imposed by the campagigners when they called off their blockades of oil refineries in September. But despite being told that the total package would be worth the equivalent of 8p off a litre of fuel, some truckers' leaders called it \"very, very poor\" and insisted that it would not buy them off. They had demanded between 15p and 26p off a litre of fuel. Brynle Williams, the Welsh farmer at the forefront of the last fuel protest, said there would be no blockade of refineries, but added: \"The general public will see through this for what it is. He has tried to seduce us with tokens like three pence off a litre, but it is not going to work.\" Mr Brown's aides said the extra money for pensioners could be more than met from higher than expected tax revenues, and the aim of the fuel concessions had been to drive a wedge between hardline protesters and mainstream motorists, who were wooed with a proposed cut in duty for clean fuel and a \u00a355 cut in road tax for cars up to 1,500cc.

Although the principal obsession of the EU as a whole, and Britain in particular, is currently the euro, the reunification of Europe through the inclusion in the community of many former Warsaw Pact countries is, in many ways, an historic objective of pre-eminent importance. Fifty-five years after the end of the second world war and almost a decade after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the ideological, economic, military and physical divisions that have plagued Europe in the past tend to be forgotten.

      "body": "<p>It's not often that the heirs of Lenin and Stalin get the opportunity to lecture the inheritors of Jefferson and Thomas Payne on liberty, the rights of man, and the pursuit of happiness. But Russian pundits, politicians, and MPs can barely suppress their sniggers at the constitutional conundrums thrown up by the Florida fiasco.</p> <p>Despite widespread evidence that ballot-rigging was rife in President Vladimir Putin's election victory last March, even the Kremlin chief could not pass up the chance to make a dig at the Americans' expense, offering Russian assistance in ensuring a fair vote.</p> <p>Putin noted that Alexander Veshnyakov, the head of Russia's election commission, was in the US to watch the American election. ''If need be, he will advise his American colleagues on how to act in the difficult position in which they find themselves,'' quipped the Russian president.</p> <p>It's an offer the Americans will have no problem refusing. But the air in Moscow is thick with the scent of Schadenfreude at the American drama. A mere eight months after Russia accomplished the first handover of power from one head of state to another through the ballot box in its history, the former foreign minister, Alexander Kozyrev, commented that the Bush-Gore chaos highlighted the ''imperfections'' of the US democratic model.</p> <p>In particular, he recommended that the US scrap the electoral college system as an anachronism established for a different era.</p> <p>Russian glee at the American dead heat is unaffected by admonitions about people in glass houses. Broad Russian disaffection with the west means that taking comfort in the US debacle triggers no corresponding self-reflection on the infinitely worse state of affairs at home.</p> <p>A dead heat or an uncertain outcome such as that produced by Bush and Gore, for example, is inconceivable in Russia.</p> <p>Boris Yeltsin reveals in his latest volume of memoirs that he almost cancelled the election for his second term in 1996 because he faced defeat by the communists.</p> <p>It was only when the big TV channels came to his rescue by destroying the communist challenger, Gennadiy Zyuganov, that Yeltsin went ahead with the poll.</p> <p>The trick was repeated a year ago. The same channels smeared and eliminated Putin's rivals last year in a ruthless campaign of character assassination that left the Kremlin clear to its current tenant. Putin refused to campaign, comparing election contests to sordid advertising for chocolate bars or sanitary towels.</p> <p>He did not need to campaign. The March election rubber-stamped a decision already taken by the shady elite running Russia.</p> <p>US elections are scrutinised and analysed everywhere, of course. After half a century of cold-war rivalry and a decade of so-called strategic partnership between Washington and Moscow, the Russians have every reason to pay particularly close attention to the race for the White House.</p> <p>So beyond the Schadenfreude, the Kremlin is closely watching the White House outcome for clues as to what it means for American foreign policy. Temperamentally, Putin, a rightwing liberal on economic policy with authoritarian leanings on social policy and civil rights, should hit it off with a Republican president.</p> <p>But Al Gore has been a key player in US-Russia relations for the past eight years, and the Kremlin preference seems to be for the devil it knows. The Russians were cross that Bush, Condoleeza Rice, and the Republicans in Congress sought to hammer Gore over policy towards Russia during the campaign, with Viktor Chernomyrdin, the former prime minister, at one stage threatening to sue US politicians over allegations of corruption.</p> <p>Officially, of course, Putin says he can work with any administration chosen by the Americans. The Kremlin expects the new administration to ensure \"continuity in interaction with Russia and the consolidation of the positive potential created by the leaders of the USA and our country in the last years,'' said Sergei Prikhodko, Putin's foreign policy aide.</p> <p>But the Russians fear that continuity could be disrupted by a more robust and assertive policy on Russia from a Bush administration, while a narrower definition of the American national interest under Bush could also be problematic.</p> <p>Bush is pledged to pushing through the \"son of Star Wars\" national missiles defence programme that so enrages the Russians. The Republicans look likely to be less accommodating on aid to Russia and supporting the International Monetary Fund and other lenders to Russia.</p> <p>''Bush will actually force Russia to decide whether to accept the US plans to create a national missile defence system or start thinking of withdrawing from the 1972 ABM treaty,'' said Aleksei Arbatov, deputy head of the parliamentary defence committee.</p> <p>And the Republicans could be tougher on Russian arms policy and arms sales to, say, Iran and China, while ignoring Russian foreign policy considerations in hotspots like the Balkans and the Middle East.</p> <p>A Bush White House will be ''extremely tough'' on Russia, Arbatov added.</p> <p>On the plus side for the Russians, however, are the Bush team's warnings that the days of the US troops in Kosovo and Bosnia are numbered. They also expect Bush perhaps to be more lukewarm on Nato's further expansion into the former Soviet satellites of eastern Europe.</p> <p>And they expect a Bush administration to dispense with considerations of humanitarian intervention, deploying US military muscle to punish trampling of human rights. On Kosovo, Nato, and human rights, Gore would be tougher than Bush, the Russians feel.</p> <p>Russian analysts worry that Bush is extremely inexperienced, above all in foreign policy. They choose to forget that 18 months ago no one had ever heard of Vladimir Putin - or that last March's ballot was the first time Putin had ever contested an election in his life.</p> <p><b>Email</b><br> <a href=\"mailto:ian.traynor@theguardian.com\">ian.traynor@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><b>Related special report</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/uselection/\">US elections</a><br></p> <p><b>Other articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.searchunlimited.co.uk/search97cgi/s97networkr_cgi?QueryText=ian+traynor&amp;Query=ian+traynor&amp;ResultColSize=2000&amp;ResultTemplate=ArchiveFull%2Ehts&amp;Collection=archive&amp;SortSpec=Vdkpublicationdate+desc&amp;ResultStart=1&amp;ResultCount=10&amp;ResultMaxDocs=1000&amp;Dtv=\">More articles by Ian Traynor</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.itar-tass.com/news.htm\" target=\"_new\">Itar-Tass news agency</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.moscowtimes.ru/05-May-2000/homepage.htm\" target=\"_new\">Moscow Times</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.russiatoday.com/\" target=\"_new\">Russia Today</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.times.spb.ru/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">St Petersburg Times</a></p>",

Putin noted that Alexander Veshnyakov, the head of Russia's election commission, was in the US to watch the American election. ''If need be, he will advise his American colleagues on how to act in the difficult position in which they find themselves,'' quipped the Russian president. It's an offer the Americans will have no problem refusing. But the air in Moscow is thick with the scent of Schadenfreude at the American drama. A mere eight months after Russia accomplished the first handover of power from one head of state to another through the ballot box in its history, the former foreign minister, Alexander Kozyrev, commented that the Bush-Gore chaos highlighted the ''imperfections'' of the US democratic model. In particular, he recommended that the US scrap the electoral college system as an anachronism established for a different era. Russian glee at the American dead heat is unaffected by admonitions about people in glass houses. Broad Russian disaffection with the west means that taking comfort in the US debacle triggers no corresponding self-reflection on the infinitely worse state of affairs at home. A dead heat or an uncertain outcome such as that produced by Bush and Gore, for example, is inconceivable in Russia. Boris Yeltsin reveals in his latest volume of memoirs that he almost cancelled the election for his second term in 1996 because he faced defeat by the communists. It was only when the big TV channels came to his rescue by destroying the communist challenger, Gennadiy Zyuganov, that Yeltsin went ahead with the poll. The trick was repeated a year ago. The same channels smeared and eliminated Putin's rivals last year in a ruthless campaign of character assassination that left the Kremlin clear to its current tenant. Putin refused to campaign, comparing election contests to sordid advertising for chocolate bars or sanitary towels. He did not need to campaign. The March election rubber-stamped a decision already taken by the shady elite running Russia. US elections are scrutinised and analysed everywhere, of course. After half a century of cold-war rivalry and a decade of so-called strategic partnership between Washington and Moscow, the Russians have every reason to pay particularly close attention to the race for the White House. So beyond the Schadenfreude, the Kremlin is closely watching the White House outcome for clues as to what it means for American foreign policy. Temperamentally, Putin, a rightwing liberal on economic policy with authoritarian leanings on social policy and civil rights, should hit it off with a Republican president. But Al Gore has been a key player in US-Russia relations for the past eight years, and the Kremlin preference seems to be for the devil it knows. The Russians were cross that Bush, Condoleeza Rice, and the Republicans in Congress sought to hammer Gore over policy towards Russia during the campaign, with Viktor Chernomyrdin, the former prime minister, at one stage threatening to sue US politicians over allegations of corruption. Officially, of course, Putin says he can work with any administration chosen by the Americans. The Kremlin expects the new administration to ensure \"continuity in interaction with Russia and the consolidation of the positive potential created by the leaders of the USA and our country in the last years,'' said Sergei Prikhodko, Putin's foreign policy aide. But the Russians fear that continuity could be disrupted by a more robust and assertive policy on Russia from a Bush administration, while a narrower definition of the American national interest under Bush could also be problematic. Bush is pledged to pushing through the \"son of Star Wars\" national missiles defence programme that so enrages the Russians. The Republicans look likely to be less accommodating on aid to Russia and supporting the International Monetary Fund and other lenders to Russia. ''Bush will actually force Russia to decide whether to accept the US plans to create a national missile defence system or start thinking of withdrawing from the 1972 ABM treaty,'' said Aleksei Arbatov, deputy head of the parliamentary defence committee. And the Republicans could be tougher on Russian arms policy and arms sales to, say, Iran and China, while ignoring Russian foreign policy considerations in hotspots like the Balkans and the Middle East. A Bush White House will be ''extremely tough'' on Russia, Arbatov added. On the plus side for the Russians, however, are the Bush team's warnings that the days of the US troops in Kosovo and Bosnia are numbered. They also expect Bush perhaps to be more lukewarm on Nato's further expansion into the former Soviet satellites of eastern Europe. And they expect a Bush administration to dispense with considerations of humanitarian intervention, deploying US military muscle to punish trampling of human rights. On Kosovo, Nato, and human rights, Gore would be tougher than Bush, the Russians feel. Russian analysts worry that Bush is extremely inexperienced, above all in foreign policy. They choose to forget that 18 months ago no one had ever heard of Vladimir Putin - or that last March's ballot was the first time Putin had ever contested an election in his life.

      "bodyText": "A \u00a31bn package to regenerate Britain's blighted inner city areas by boosting investment and enterprise was announced yesterday by Gordon Brown. At its heart were measures to cut stamp duty on properties in disadvantaged areas, reduce VAT to 5% on house conversions and provide \"generous\" tax credits to encourage community investment. Mr Brown said a forthcoming urban white paper would set out a comprehensive plan of improvement for the first time in 20 years. \"The government's strategy is to create attractive places for individuals and business - places that create and share prosperity, and that provide good quality services that meet the needs of everyone,\" he said. All towns and cities should aim to be places where people want to live and businesses choose to locate - through efficient land use, quality design, modern infrastructure and sustainable use of resources, he said. There were also plans to accelerate tax relief for cleaning up contaminated land, give tax relief to bring empty flats over shops back into use and provide further business rate relief for small companies in assisted area. A prototype community development venture fund is to be created. Mr Brown said: \"Future jobs and long-term prosperity will come, not from benefit cheques or from the old subsidies, but by a radically new approach - encouraging economic activity and business development on the lines proposed by the Rogers and Cohen reports.\" Lord Rogers, chairman of the government's urban task force and a past critic of the government's sloth in reviving Britain's inner cities expressed surprise and delight at the fiscal measures announced by the chancellor. Almost all the reforms announced by Mr Brown originate from Lord Rogers' Towards an Urban Renaissance report published last year or from the social investment task force report produced by Ronald Cohen chairman of venture capitalists Apax Parters. Lord Rogers said: \"I have been saying 'let's go further and faster', but I am now extremely pleased. Somehow, there seemed to be a strong countryside lobby in Britain, but no urban lobby.\" Lord Rogers said the relief on developers that clean up contaminated land was vital to remove risk and give developers confidence. \"It's critical because developers need assurance that that they can reclaim the cost of restoring land upfront.\" Lord Rogers also welcomed the proposals for abolition of stamp duty on all property transactions in deprived areas, comparing the idea with the Conservative's Enterprise Zones. Mr Cohen also welcomed the chancellor's statement saying he was particularly impressed by the speed with which government had responded to his report. He believed the initiatives would lead to companies like his own setting up specialist community development teams similar to those established for other sectors such as new technology. Ed Mayo, director of the New Economics Foundation think-tank which helped Mr Cohen with his report said more than 100,000 jobs should be created within five years by the government measures. Michael Roberts, director of industrial policy at the CBI, also believed the government moves were \"broadly positive\". Abolition of stamp duty for disadvantaged communities was seen as a big carrot by Michael Quinlan, head of stamp duty at PricewaterhouseCoopers said: \"This could be of considerable benefit in terms of overcoming resistance to build on these sites.

      "body": "<p>If you want to know whether fuel in Britain is too expensive or too cheap, just look at how it's used. One superstore chain lands its fish at Aberdeen and trucks it down to Cornwall to be smoked. Another buys vegetables in Worcestershire, then drives them first to Hereford, then Dyfed, then Manchester before trucking them back to Worcestershire to be sold. Onions are shipped in from Argentina, potatoes from Australia. Every day aeroplanes, whose fuel, being wholly untaxed, costs only 17 pence a litre, bring lettuces from Kenya and Zimbabwe.</p> <p>Truckers in Britain are in trouble not because diesel prices are too high, but because their own trade associations, being partly controlled by the superstores, have demanded that the government allow ever heavier lorries on to the roads. This means that fewer vehicles are needed to shift the same amount of goods (though they have to travel further), with the result that the sector is now suffering from over- capacity. Their customers are, therefore, able to nail the truckers to the floor.</p> <p>It is a source of enduring mystery to me that farmers, like lorry drivers, are calling for cheaper, rather than more expensive, fuel. Cheap fuel has destroyed British farming. It has allowed produce from the other side of the world to outcompete our own.</p> <p>Within Britain, it enables superstores to centralise their distribution networks, playing farmers off against each other until they find the lowest national prices for the products they want to buy. The concessions Gordon Brown made yesterday will harm the very people who demanded them.</p> <p>By a marvellous stroke of irony, the deadline for government action the truckers and farmers have set (Monday November 13) is also the day on which the global climate talks open in the Hague. Their purpose is to encourage countries to ratify the Kyoto protocol on reducing carbon emissions. Governments will be able to meet their targets only if they keep fuel prices high.</p> <p>Prospects for the climate treaty look, if George Bush has indeed won the US presidency, less than promising. Mr Bush, who was suckled on oil, will block its implementation by any means possible.</p> <p>Even if it were to be enforced, however, the cuts it demands are just a fraction of those required to prevent the proliferation of such freak weather events as those we have suffered over the past two weeks. If governments are to make any appreciable difference to their impact on the world's weather, in other words, they will have to go it alone.</p> <p>But what on earth could we do? It's simple. All that needs to be done to bring our contribution to climate change to an end is for the government to announce that in five years' time the burning of fossil fuel in the United Kingdom will be illegal.</p> <p>This is the point at which all those kind souls who write every week to express their tender concern for my sanity conclude that I have finally taken leave of my senses. The entire economy is built on the combustion of fossil fuels. To ban them would surely be to bring the country to its knees. I suggest it would do precisely the opposite.</p> <p>The task is certainly more achievable than it might at first appear. In 1941, the entire US economy was turned around in a matter of months, as civil manufacture was switched to military production.

      "bodyText": "If you want to know whether fuel in Britain is too expensive or too cheap, just look at how it's used. One superstore chain lands its fish at Aberdeen and trucks it down to Cornwall to be smoked. Another buys vegetables in Worcestershire, then drives them first to Hereford, then Dyfed, then Manchester before trucking them back to Worcestershire to be sold. Onions are shipped in from Argentina, potatoes from Australia. Every day aeroplanes, whose fuel, being wholly untaxed, costs only 17 pence a litre, bring lettuces from Kenya and Zimbabwe. Truckers in Britain are in trouble not because diesel prices are too high, but because their own trade associations, being partly controlled by the superstores, have demanded that the government allow ever heavier lorries on to the roads. This means that fewer vehicles are needed to shift the same amount of goods (though they have to travel further), with the result that the sector is now suffering from over- capacity. Their customers are, therefore, able to nail the truckers to the floor. It is a source of enduring mystery to me that farmers, like lorry drivers, are calling for cheaper, rather than more expensive, fuel. Cheap fuel has destroyed British farming. It has allowed produce from the other side of the world to outcompete our own. Within Britain, it enables superstores to centralise their distribution networks, playing farmers off against each other until they find the lowest national prices for the products they want to buy. The concessions Gordon Brown made yesterday will harm the very people who demanded them. By a marvellous stroke of irony, the deadline for government action the truckers and farmers have set (Monday November 13) is also the day on which the global climate talks open in the Hague. Their purpose is to encourage countries to ratify the Kyoto protocol on reducing carbon emissions. Governments will be able to meet their targets only if they keep fuel prices high. Prospects for the climate treaty look, if George Bush has indeed won the US presidency, less than promising. Mr Bush, who was suckled on oil, will block its implementation by any means possible. Even if it were to be enforced, however, the cuts it demands are just a fraction of those required to prevent the proliferation of such freak weather events as those we have suffered over the past two weeks. If governments are to make any appreciable difference to their impact on the world's weather, in other words, they will have to go it alone. But what on earth could we do? It's simple. All that needs to be done to bring our contribution to climate change to an end is for the government to announce that in five years' time the burning of fossil fuel in the United Kingdom will be illegal. This is the point at which all those kind souls who write every week to express their tender concern for my sanity conclude that I have finally taken leave of my senses. The entire economy is built on the combustion of fossil fuels. To ban them would surely be to bring the country to its knees. I suggest it would do precisely the opposite. The task is certainly more achievable than it might at first appear. In 1941, the entire US economy was turned around in a matter of months, as civil manufacture was switched to military production. As Jack Doyle's new book The Autocrats documents, General Motors designed, tested, and started mass producing an amphibious truck in 90 days from a standing start. Ford was soon turning out a precision bomber every 63 minutes. This transformation was attended, of course, by a massive boost in economic activity and employment. And all this was 60 years ago, before the age of \"flexibility\" and \"just-in-time production\". Northern Europe, according to a new report commissioned by Greenpeace, could meet three times its total energy needs simply by exploiting offshore wind. Every terrace house could produce more energy than it consumes by covering its roof with solar panels.

The last time the US electorate was so torn was in 1960, when John F Kennedy and Richard Nixon were separated by a whisker of little more than 100,000 votes. That split-decision came at the end of a long period of contentment and prosperity, and presaged a painfully divisive decade. Will the Gore-Bush deadlock foretell an era of similar strife? Not even the most detailed exit poll will tell us the answer.",

An all-Republican Washington beckons for the first time in nearly 50 years. The one agent of compromise that does impose itself in the US system - a potent one, when Congress and White House are at odds - will be missing.

They disguise, though, the likely affinity between Congress and White House in a world view that has few roots in inter nationalism. The voices speaking for that attitude, already diminished in Washington, will be significantly fewer. Perhaps the most optimistic way to put it is that there will be a reinterpretation of America's role in the world, conducted in a unilateralist spirit. The more pessimistic take is to recall the Republican platform's scoffing reference to there being no limit to \"candidate Gore's new agenda for America as global social worker\".</p> <p>Three strands have survived the dodge-and-weave of the campaign and remain salient Bush foreign policy positions. First, he believes in more defence spending, but for an army that does not fight. Colin Powell, his presumed secretary of state, is no help here. Powell was first architect of the doctrine that the prospect of a single body bag was a veto on any form of US military intervention. The anachronistic notion that armies are needed to defend national territory, against enemies nobody can identify, has had its day in Europe, where hostile neighbours are potentially close at hand. Yet in Republican America, run by a cold war family and its retainers, the alternative notion of military power as a flexible arm of foreign policy will be hard to sell. European leaders, exponents of this modern realism, face conflict with their ally.</p> <p>Second, Bush and his people are obsessed by national missile defence. He repeated with casual frequency his commitment to build it. Again, experience may provide reasons for realism to prevail over macho doctrine. Technology and diplomacy will have their say. But again, a regime unversed in internationalism, buoyed by a passion to renounce the ineffectual excursions Clinton made into the field, will not be primarily concerned with what the allies think.</p> <p>Third, Bush's definition of the American interest, insofar as it has emerged, leaves out a great deal. It fails to address many modern crises. Maybe, again, it's hard to be sure of this as a long-term position. But Republican senators who pay more attention than Bush to foreign affairs are not known for their commitment to multilateral institutions. They've shown little interest in the Aids calamity now striking beyond Africa in Asia and Russia, and still less in the implications of global warming. A modern internationalism must start from an interest in engagement and dialogue with countries of many kinds. If the UN is to face another four years of American cheapness and neglect, how does that advance the US strategic interest? If world poverty is also outside the definition, what does America have to say about terrorism and drug-running that are connected to it?</p> <p>The election campaign avoided all these issues. As Jim Hoagland wrote in the Washington Post, neither Bush nor Gore \"put forward compelling cases for their management of history's greatest accumulation of power by one nation\". Both were timid and unspecific about every hard problem. And Clinton has been no Metternich, or Truman. Gore has a vision of the world that engages with reality, as well as a coherent position on the environment which Clinton largely suppressed. But that looks as though it's done for. Bush, president-all-but-elect, has nothing, except a powerful instinct to reinforce the prejudices of those titans he'll find on the Hill when he reaches the detested city of Washington, DC.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:hugoyoung@compuserve.com\">hugoyoung@compuserve.com</a></p> <p>Breaking news and detailed back-ground on the race for the White House on the Guardian network at <a href=\"mail:www. guardianunlimited.co.uk/uselection\">www. guardianunlimited.co.uk/uselection</a></p>",

The men who would be president have been put through a ridiculous, essentially phoney ordeal. A watching audience around the world has been force fed ersatz omniscience. There will, in the American way of things, be a terrible inquest. The voices who want exit polling abolished are already loud. Very little from the longest night of punditry survived into the light of day. Reports of a monster turnout - a repeatedly claimed triumph for resurgent democracy - proved wildly overblown. Bush versus Gore barely scrambled above the 49% apathy of Clinton versus Dole four years ago. The commentators' favourite talking point - What if Gore wins the electoral college but Bush wins the popular vote? - looked apposite enough, but was entirely the wrong way round. What wisdom survived? Only the banal. \"Florida does not mean Gore is going to win the election - but it does mean we're in for a long night\", said an already weary Dan Rather on CBS. \"The analogy isn't threading the needle any longer, it's a pinball machine,\" said Mac McLarty on NBC. \"This is going to be a painful night for the person who loses,\" said Judy Woodruff on CNN. And a universal anthem: \"Because we're calling a race too close to call, doesn't mean it's close.\"",

The risk is a repeat of the late 1980s mistake of claiming a surplus one year could fund tax cuts for every year and by committing in tax what was yet to be earned. We will take no risks with stability.</p> <p>This pre-Budget report makes a different choice: to move forward with our three-year spending plans that will double public investment and by continuing to cut debt interest and unemployment, combining public spending with targeted tax cuts to do more for pensioners and give families the lowest direct tax burden for 30 years.</p> <p>So this statement sets out a balanced approach - first, stability and prudence to keep interest rates low, second, tackling under-investment and then, when it is affordable, targeted tax cuts.</p> <p>Let me turn first to the forecasts for the economy. I can report that this year inflation is meeting its 2.5% target; long-term interest rates are around the lowest for 30 years. The economy is forecast to grow by 3% this year, manufacturingby 1.25% and exports by 8%. Consumer demand will grow by 3.5%, with living standards rising, and business investment by 14.5%.</p> <p>With 1.1m more in work than in 1997, Britain now has the lowest unemployment since 1979.</p> <p>I can report that, even in times of uncertainty for the world economy, the forecast for next year is that inflation will meet its target of 2.5%; manufacturing will grow by between 2% and 2.25%; exports will grow by between 7% and 7.5%; growth will range from 2.25% to 2.75%; consumer demand will grow by 2.25% to2.5%; business investment by 1.5% to 2%; and total investment by 4.25% to 4.5%. Growth from 1979 averaged 2%. Since 1997 it has been 2.7%.</p> <p>Long-term prosperity for all is our objective. And that depends upon us reaching American levels of productivity growth. So today I am proposing to encourage entrepreneurship and expand investment.</p> <p>To make Britain the best place for multinationals to locate, we will build on our cut in corporation tax from 33p to 30p - the lowest of all major countries - by consulting on three major changes: to abolish from April 2001 the withholding tax; to relieve tax on sales of substantial shareholdings by firms; to give tax relief for intellectual property and goodwill. This year corporation tax revenues are \u00a32.5bn lower than forecast.</p> <p>My second set of proposals help small businesses. Today I am publishing for consultation proposals that simplify small business VAT. I will now examine further incentives to help manufacturing.</p> <p>To help high-risk and e-commerce companies recruit and retain the staff they need, we propose to expand tax relief for share options and make Britain the most attractive environment for e-commerce. All employees will be able to benefit from our enterprise management incentive scheme.</p> <p>To expand savings generally we will review all capital limits that deter savings. Already 9m Isa accounts have been opened, and \u00a33bn more is being saved by low income savers. The tax free limit for Isa savers has been set for next year at \u00a35,000. I propose to once more set it at \u00a37,000.</p> <p>I have one further proposal for a special tax relief. We plan to do more to meet targets of cutting world poverty by half and cut by two-thirds infant mortality which through preventible diseases carries off one in seven children before the age of five.</p> <p>I have decided in the interests of keeping interest rates and mortgage rates as low as possible to lock in a fiscal stance that is the same or tighter than we said at the time of the last Budget. Our first fiscal rule is that over the cycle there must be a current surplus. So however tempting it may be to identify temporary surpluses as an excuse for permanent injections of resources, our golden rule demands constant prudence.</p> <p>In the Budget I forecast this year's current surplus at \u00a314bn. I now forecast this surplus to be \u00a316.6bn, and in the years from 2001 to 2002, current surpluses are forecast to be 16, 14, 8, and 8 - figures that ensure we remain on course to balance the current Budget over the economic cycle.</p> <p>Our second fiscal rule - the sustainable investment rule - is that while over the cycle we will borrow for investment, we do not borrow for consumption.</p> <p>Having made the necessary difficult tax and spending decisions, we have, in the three years since 1997, reduced the ratio of debt to national income from 44% to 41.9% to 39.6 and 36.8% this April.</p> <p>I can report that two decisions - first, to use the proceeds from the spectrum auction to reduce our debt and second, to use this year's surplus to repay debt - now make possible a further and even more substantial reduction in debt that will keep interest payments low.</p> <p>Because we are cutting the stock of debt by as much as one third, I can report that the public sector net debt as a share of GDP will now fall from 36.8% last year to 32.3% this year to 30.9% in 2001-2002 and from what was a debt to GDP ratio as high as 44% in 1997, I can report that this ratio is forecast to fall to 30%.</p> <p>And with long-term interest rates lower and debt well within the 40% ceiling, we are not only well placed to deal with the ups and downs of the economic cycle but have the best platform for years for sustained long-term growth.</p> <p>Today we are having to deal with the rise in world oil prices from $11 to $31. Because Opec accepts that price is unacceptably high, our international efforts are geared to ensuring that production is raised and prices fall.</p> <p>So I recognise and understand the very genuine concerns motorists and hauliers have and will do more to meet people's concerns without putting at risk our economic stability. I propose an across the board freeze on all fuels that would initially last until April 2002.</p> <p>I intend to go further to help the haulage industry. I propose support for scrapping or converting older lorries with a \u00a3100m investment fund. But we can do more. We intend to introduce a British disc under which non-British firms and lorries pay their share.</p> <p>Reform in vehicle excise duty for lorries will radically cut rates for larger lorries; the scheme will be implemented in Budget 2001, cutting the rates to match the lowest in Europe. I have allocated \u00a3265m for this financial year for a refund scheme that can repay lorry owners up to half of this year's licence fee. In addition to freezing duty on red diesel at 3p a litre, I also intend in Budget 2001 to abolish VED on tractors and agricultural vehicles completely.</p> <p>I now have a similar proposal for car licence fees. For all cars under 1200cc there is also now a lower rate licence fee with a \u00a355 deduction on the standard licence. I propose to extend the lower rate licence fee to cars up to 1500cc, to be paid out from July but to be backdated from today.</p> <p>I turn now to measures of benefit to pensioners. The minimum income guarantee, which is \u00a378.45 today, will be raised in April by \u00a314 to \u00a392.15. I can confirm that now and in future years free TV licences will remain for the over-75s. The Christmas bonus will continue and the winter allowance will be paid at \u00a3150.</p> <p>But the transitional arrangements to our new pension reform will start this week. Cheques are being sent out from Monday. The winter allowance for this year specially will be paid at \u00a3200 to every pensioner household free of tax.</p>",

Growth from 1979 averaged 2%. Since 1997 it has been 2.7%. Long-term prosperity for all is our objective. And that depends upon us reaching American levels of productivity growth. So today I am proposing to encourage entrepreneurship and expand investment. To make Britain the best place for multinationals to locate, we will build on our cut in corporation tax from 33p to 30p - the lowest of all major countries - by consulting on three major changes: to abolish from April 2001 the withholding tax; to relieve tax on sales of substantial shareholdings by firms; to give tax relief for intellectual property and goodwill. This year corporation tax revenues are \u00a32.5bn lower than forecast. My second set of proposals help small businesses. Today I am publishing for consultation proposals that simplify small business VAT. I will now examine further incentives to help manufacturing. To help high-risk and e-commerce companies recruit and retain the staff they need, we propose to expand tax relief for share options and make Britain the most attractive environment for e-commerce. All employees will be able to benefit from our enterprise management incentive scheme. To expand savings generally we will review all capital limits that deter savings. Already 9m Isa accounts have been opened, and \u00a33bn more is being saved by low income savers. The tax free limit for Isa savers has been set for next year at \u00a35,000. I propose to once more set it at \u00a37,000. I have one further proposal for a special tax relief. We plan to do more to meet targets of cutting world poverty by half and cut by two-thirds infant mortality which through preventible diseases carries off one in seven children before the age of five. I have decided in the interests of keeping interest rates and mortgage rates as low as possible to lock in a fiscal stance that is the same or tighter than we said at the time of the last Budget. Our first fiscal rule is that over the cycle there must be a current surplus. So however tempting it may be to identify temporary surpluses as an excuse for permanent injections of resources, our golden rule demands constant prudence. In the Budget I forecast this year's current surplus at \u00a314bn. I now forecast this surplus to be \u00a316.6bn, and in the years from 2001 to 2002, current surpluses are forecast to be 16, 14, 8, and 8 - figures that ensure we remain on course to balance the current Budget over the economic cycle. Our second fiscal rule - the sustainable investment rule - is that while over the cycle we will borrow for investment, we do not borrow for consumption. Having made the necessary difficult tax and spending decisions, we have, in the three years since 1997, reduced the ratio of debt to national income from 44% to 41.9% to 39.6 and 36.8% this April. I can report that two decisions - first, to use the proceeds from the spectrum auction to reduce our debt and second, to use this year's surplus to repay debt - now make possible a further and even more substantial reduction in debt that will keep interest payments low. Because we are cutting the stock of debt by as much as one third, I can report that the public sector net debt as a share of GDP will now fall from 36.8% last year to 32.3% this year to 30.9% in 2001-2002 and from what was a debt to GDP ratio as high as 44% in 1997, I can report that this ratio is forecast to fall to 30%. And with long-term interest rates lower and debt well within the 40% ceiling, we are not only well placed to deal with the ups and downs of the economic cycle but have the best platform for years for sustained long-term growth. Today we are having to deal with the rise in world oil prices from $11 to $31. Because Opec accepts that price is unacceptably high, our international efforts are geared to ensuring that production is raised and prices fall. So I recognise and understand the very genuine concerns motorists and hauliers have and will do more to meet people's concerns without putting at risk our economic stability. I propose an across the board freeze on all fuels that would initially last until April 2002. I intend to go further to help the haulage industry. I propose support for scrapping or converting older lorries with a \u00a3100m investment fund. But we can do more. We intend to introduce a British disc under which non-British firms and lorries pay their share. Reform in vehicle excise duty for lorries will radically cut rates for larger lorries; the scheme will be implemented in Budget 2001, cutting the rates to match the lowest in Europe. I have allocated \u00a3265m for this financial year for a refund scheme that can repay lorry owners up to half of this year's licence fee. In addition to freezing duty on red diesel at 3p a litre, I also intend in Budget 2001 to abolish VED on tractors and agricultural vehicles completely. I now have a similar proposal for car licence fees. For all cars under 1200cc there is also now a lower rate licence fee with a \u00a355 deduction on the standard licence. I propose to extend the lower rate licence fee to cars up to 1500cc, to be paid out from July but to be backdated from today. I turn now to measures of benefit to pensioners. The minimum income guarantee, which is \u00a378.45 today, will be raised in April by \u00a314 to \u00a392.15. I can confirm that now and in future years free TV licences will remain for the over-75s. The Christmas bonus will continue and the winter allowance will be paid at \u00a3150. But the transitional arrangements to our new pension reform will start this week. Cheques are being sent out from Monday. The winter allowance for this year specially will be paid at \u00a3200 to every pensioner household free of tax.",

With the violence unabated, Israel's military remains shaken by the attention given to Mohammed al-Durreh's death. \"Often a popular demonstration becomes a firefight. This is how the Palestinians obtained the death of the child Mohammed al-Durreh who became the symbol of this intifada,\" said a senior Israeli intelligence official. He added: \"The Palestinian Authority is exploiting his death in an almost sickening fashion.\" Useful links Madeleine Albright's office Yasser Arafat's office Ehud Barak's office Israeli government Moledet - Land of Israel Loyalty Party (Torah-based religious party) Iris - Information Regarding Israel's Security (promoting Israeli security) Zo Artzeinu (Israeli settlers' group) Organisation of Rabbis for the People of Israel Palestinian National Authority Egyptian presidency Hamas",

The Democratic candidate campaigned tirelessly for the citizenry's support, barnstorming back and forward across the country again and again. His party launched an enormous get-out-the-vote effort with Jesse Jackson, the civil rights leader, knocking on doors in Pennsylvania and Mr Gore and his running mate, Joseph Lieberman, cajoling and pleading in Florida until the very last moment.</p> <p>In the event, and despite much criticism of his election strategy and personal manner, Mr Gore's endeavours appeared to have paid off. With almost all votes tallied last night, he led George W Bush, his Republican rival, by approximately 250,000 votes nationwide - by 49% to 48% of the popular vote - with Green presidential candidate Ralph Nader picking up the remaining 3%. Even though some postal ballots have yet to be added in, and despite the recount in Florida, these totals are now considered unlikely to change significantly. So, by any rational measure, surely, the banner headline would be: Gore Wins!</p> <p>Not so. Bemusingly for a country that prides itself on a democratic tradition which it energetically exports round the world as a paradigm for modern nation states, the outcome remains in suspense. The problem lies within the electoral college where, despite his popular \"victory\", Mr Gore may well fail to gain the edge. Although the Democrat is currently only 10 college votes away from the winning magic number of 270, a Bush win in Florida would give the Republican another 25 votes to add to his accumulated total of 246 and thus hand him the contest on a plate. Why? Because it is the electoral college, not voters at large, that ultimately decides who takes the glorious walk down Pennsylvania Avenue.</p> <p>A travesty, you may cry. A gross distortion of the will of the people. And indeed that may be the case put forward by Democrats and others in the coming days should Mr Gore fail to carry Florida and be pipped at the post in this extraordinary fashion. Although there are precedents for different results in the popular vote and electoral college, they date from the 19th century and had more to do with Tammany Hall frauds and disputed tallies than with a straight, unalloyed contradiction of outcomes, as now. What is more, the college is undoubtedly an oddity. It dates from an era when communications were poor, when the emphasis was on states' rights within a federal system, when it was felt important to oblige candidates to obtain a broad geographical spread of support - and when governing elites in Washington in any case tended to distrust the vagaries of pure, unadulterated democracy. Many will maintain that such an anachronistic mechanism cannot nowadays be allowed to upset a clear if slim popular mandate. Should not Mr Bush do the decent thing and cede the election to Mr Gore?</p> <p>Although it seems logical, it would be a very bad precedent. The Republicans can argue with justice that they fought the election under an agreed set of rules that included the electoral college system. They will doubtless maintain that were the situation to be reversed, Mr Gore would be unlikely to give away his prize. They will certainly portray Mr Gore as a bad loser, as a man prepared to hold the country to ransom and cultivate a damaging constitutional crisis out of selfish, narrow ambition.

      "bodyText": "The argument that Al Gore won Tuesday's American presidential election is at first glance overwhelming. The Democratic candidate campaigned tirelessly for the citizenry's support, barnstorming back and forward across the country again and again. His party launched an enormous get-out-the-vote effort with Jesse Jackson, the civil rights leader, knocking on doors in Pennsylvania and Mr Gore and his running mate, Joseph Lieberman, cajoling and pleading in Florida until the very last moment. In the event, and despite much criticism of his election strategy and personal manner, Mr Gore's endeavours appeared to have paid off. With almost all votes tallied last night, he led George W Bush, his Republican rival, by approximately 250,000 votes nationwide - by 49% to 48% of the popular vote - with Green presidential candidate Ralph Nader picking up the remaining 3%. Even though some postal ballots have yet to be added in, and despite the recount in Florida, these totals are now considered unlikely to change significantly. So, by any rational measure, surely, the banner headline would be: Gore Wins! Not so. Bemusingly for a country that prides itself on a democratic tradition which it energetically exports round the world as a paradigm for modern nation states, the outcome remains in suspense. The problem lies within the electoral college where, despite his popular \"victory\", Mr Gore may well fail to gain the edge. Although the Democrat is currently only 10 college votes away from the winning magic number of 270, a Bush win in Florida would give the Republican another 25 votes to add to his accumulated total of 246 and thus hand him the contest on a plate. Why? Because it is the electoral college, not voters at large, that ultimately decides who takes the glorious walk down Pennsylvania Avenue. A travesty, you may cry. A gross distortion of the will of the people. And indeed that may be the case put forward by Democrats and others in the coming days should Mr Gore fail to carry Florida and be pipped at the post in this extraordinary fashion. Although there are precedents for different results in the popular vote and electoral college, they date from the 19th century and had more to do with Tammany Hall frauds and disputed tallies than with a straight, unalloyed contradiction of outcomes, as now. What is more, the college is undoubtedly an oddity. It dates from an era when communications were poor, when the emphasis was on states' rights within a federal system, when it was felt important to oblige candidates to obtain a broad geographical spread of support - and when governing elites in Washington in any case tended to distrust the vagaries of pure, unadulterated democracy. Many will maintain that such an anachronistic mechanism cannot nowadays be allowed to upset a clear if slim popular mandate. Should not Mr Bush do the decent thing and cede the election to Mr Gore? Although it seems logical, it would be a very bad precedent. The Republicans can argue with justice that they fought the election under an agreed set of rules that included the electoral college system. They will doubtless maintain that were the situation to be reversed, Mr Gore would be unlikely to give away his prize. They will certainly portray Mr Gore as a bad loser, as a man prepared to hold the country to ransom and cultivate a damaging constitutional crisis out of selfish, narrow ambition. Any encouragement given to delegates to the electoral college who may sympathise with Mr Gore's predicament to switch sides (which has happened occasionally in the past) would also rightly be condemned as gross interference in the long-established democratic process. If Mr Gore wins in Florida, where the result of the recount is promised late today, then these dilemmas will be avoided, at least this time. He will be the victor in both popular and electoral college terms. But if he loses, his only proper course is to accept a bitter defeat as gracefully as he can - and then, if he has the spirit for it, launch a new campaign for electoral reform.

The disclosure came hours after Tony Blair launched an attack on Mr Hague on the eve of the damning report from the national audit office's examination of the \u00a31bn dome fiasco. Mr Blair's attack came as Mr Hague urged that the dome minister, Lord Falconer, should resign if he is criticised in the report, which is due today. On the day after thieves tried to steal the dome's diamond display, Mr Blair told the Tory leader: \"The only difference between the robbers yesterday and you is that the Tories are never caught at the scene of the crime.\" Yet, he added: \"Do you remember the cabinet committee GEN 36 established in February 1996 by the then prime minister to consider aspects of the dome, funding, its financial management, who should be appointed to it, where it was sited, how it was designed?\" Mr Hague, he said, had been a member of it. \"I will accept criticism from members of the public on the dome, but not from you,\" he declared. Mr Blair insisted the decision to build the dome had been taken by the committee, of which Mr Hague had been a member. It had also decided on the Greenwich site, the appointment of senior managers, the lottery money and financing of the dome, and had made projections of visitor numbers. Mr Hague rejected the attack saying: \"It defies credulity that the prime minister thinks it was now all to do with the previous administration.\" Visitor numbers had been reviewed and confirmed by this government, and he quoted Mr Blair as saying the dome was the most exciting thing happening in the world in the year 2000, would last for decades and was an international landmark. \"If the report tomorrow seriously criticises this government for its mishandling of the dome, will the dome minister now take responsibility and resign,\" he said. Last night's leaked memorandum shows clearly that the original proposals endorsed by the millennium commission on May 24, 1995, planned a minimum 15m visitors. The first set of guidelines proposed in July 1996 said the aim was to acheive between 15m and 30 m visits a year for the main millennium exhibition. When the dome site was chosen in February 1996 a figure of 10.9m-16m visitors was suggested, which was reduced to 10m in February 1997, when Michael Heseltine, the former deputy Tory prime minister, was in charge. The memo does show that when Peter Mandelson took over in May 1997 the figures were revised upwards to 12m. Tories were last night furious that Mr Blair had disclosed Mr Hague's role in the original plans, but the information about the committee is contained in a parliamentary answer from John Major in 1996.

      "body": "<p>Dick Morrissey, who has died aged 60 from cancer, was one of Britain's brightest jazz stars and a man who had a key role in the early fusion between jazz and rock during the 1970s.</p> <p>As jazz fashions seesawed between freer forms and fusion, Morrissey moved towards the latter, notably during the early years of a much-acclaimed partnership with guitarist Jim Mullen that saw them working with the Average White Band, the Scottish group who became the first British exponents of blue-eyed soul.</p> <p>Born in Surrey, Morrissey went to school in Sutton and was a self-taught musician. He began as a clarinettist in his early teens, but subsequently learned all the saxophones, plus flute. In his late teens he worked with the bandleader Harry South, first appearing in the London clubs as a tenor saxophonist, the instrument with which he was always most closely identified.</p> <p>John Coltrane's approach to the tenor had yet to make much of an impact in Britain, and Morrissey came up with a startling and warmly appreciated blend of Stan Getz and Sonny Rollins, the phrasing of one allied to the abrasive tones of the other. He was also influenced by the example of Tubby Hayes, whose lightening-quick forays through complex harmonies he was probably the first to emulate.</p> <p>Morrissey soon established himself as leader of various quartets at Ronnie Scott's club, working with Phil Seaman and Harry South. In 1961 he recorded his first solo album, It's Morrissey Man! He went on to record a live album in 1966 with the blues legend Jimmy Witherspoon. By the mid-60s, though, a newer breed of musician, linked to Ornette Coleman or to various kinds of music inspired, however indirectly, by Coleman, had emerged. Before his 30th birthday, Morrissey might already have been in danger of dropping off the jazz map, perhaps resigned to a decade or more of studio anonymity.</p> <p>Instead, he adapted his hard, no-nonsense tones to fit various contexts of soul or jazz-rock. By 1970, he was co-leading the group If with guitarist Terry Smith. After the original band split up, in 1973 Morrissey brought in new young musicians, including Geoff Whitehorn, Cliff Davies and Gabriel Magno, and recorded the albums Not Just a Bunch of Pretty Faces and Tea Break Over, Back On Your 'Eads, before touring in America. In 1975 the group disbanded and Morrissey went on to work with the Average White Band for their Atlantic recordings in New York. It was in that city, in 1976, that he also worked with Herbie Mann. Morrissey was now sufficiently well known and respected in the soul and jazz-rock milieu to be picked for the Blue Note album recorded in London by organist Jack McDuff as a follow-up to his big hit, Theme From the Electric Surfboard.</p> <p>By the mid-70s, he had also joined up with Jim Mullen to form the historic jazz-rock band Morrissey/Mullen. They recorded six albums between 1977 and 1988, including the critically acclaimed Cape Wrath (1979). Their earlier collaborations often reflected the electric currents of the time, Morrissey sometimes playing soprano saxophone in the kind of glitzy context Weather Report had popularised. On tenor he was no longer tempted to do it all at once: there's a mature relaxation about his best work of that era, exemplified by a recording of the classic Mal Waldron ballad Soul Eyes.</p> <p>Towards the end of its formal existence, the Morrissey/ Mullen band had edged closer to the mainstream without losing its rock-hard edge. A straight-from-the-heart tenor style, with a big sound thrown in, also made Morrissey a natural to front organ trios, and he often joined organist Mike Carr. With Mullen also on hand and Mark Taylor on drums, Good Times &amp; The Blues from 1993 ranks as some of the finest organ jazz recorded outside the US.</p> <p>Throughout his career Morrissey was always in demand as a saxophonist on the recording circuit. In the 1980s he worked with Peter Gabriel and Roy Harper; with Paul McCartney on The Long and Winding Road; and on the soundtrack of Ridley Scott's Bladerunner.

      "bodyText": "Dick Morrissey, who has died aged 60 from cancer, was one of Britain's brightest jazz stars and a man who had a key role in the early fusion between jazz and rock during the 1970s. As jazz fashions seesawed between freer forms and fusion, Morrissey moved towards the latter, notably during the early years of a much-acclaimed partnership with guitarist Jim Mullen that saw them working with the Average White Band, the Scottish group who became the first British exponents of blue-eyed soul. Born in Surrey, Morrissey went to school in Sutton and was a self-taught musician. He began as a clarinettist in his early teens, but subsequently learned all the saxophones, plus flute. In his late teens he worked with the bandleader Harry South, first appearing in the London clubs as a tenor saxophonist, the instrument with which he was always most closely identified. John Coltrane's approach to the tenor had yet to make much of an impact in Britain, and Morrissey came up with a startling and warmly appreciated blend of Stan Getz and Sonny Rollins, the phrasing of one allied to the abrasive tones of the other. He was also influenced by the example of Tubby Hayes, whose lightening-quick forays through complex harmonies he was probably the first to emulate. Morrissey soon established himself as leader of various quartets at Ronnie Scott's club, working with Phil Seaman and Harry South. In 1961 he recorded his first solo album, It's Morrissey Man! He went on to record a live album in 1966 with the blues legend Jimmy Witherspoon. By the mid-60s, though, a newer breed of musician, linked to Ornette Coleman or to various kinds of music inspired, however indirectly, by Coleman, had emerged. Before his 30th birthday, Morrissey might already have been in danger of dropping off the jazz map, perhaps resigned to a decade or more of studio anonymity. Instead, he adapted his hard, no-nonsense tones to fit various contexts of soul or jazz-rock. By 1970, he was co-leading the group If with guitarist Terry Smith. After the original band split up, in 1973 Morrissey brought in new young musicians, including Geoff Whitehorn, Cliff Davies and Gabriel Magno, and recorded the albums Not Just a Bunch of Pretty Faces and Tea Break Over, Back On Your 'Eads, before touring in America. In 1975 the group disbanded and Morrissey went on to work with the Average White Band for their Atlantic recordings in New York. It was in that city, in 1976, that he also worked with Herbie Mann. Morrissey was now sufficiently well known and respected in the soul and jazz-rock milieu to be picked for the Blue Note album recorded in London by organist Jack McDuff as a follow-up to his big hit, Theme From the Electric Surfboard. By the mid-70s, he had also joined up with Jim Mullen to form the historic jazz-rock band Morrissey/Mullen. They recorded six albums between 1977 and 1988, including the critically acclaimed Cape Wrath (1979). Their earlier collaborations often reflected the electric currents of the time, Morrissey sometimes playing soprano saxophone in the kind of glitzy context Weather Report had popularised. On tenor he was no longer tempted to do it all at once: there's a mature relaxation about his best work of that era, exemplified by a recording of the classic Mal Waldron ballad Soul Eyes. Towards the end of its formal existence, the Morrissey/ Mullen band had edged closer to the mainstream without losing its rock-hard edge. A straight-from-the-heart tenor style, with a big sound thrown in, also made Morrissey a natural to front organ trios, and he often joined organist Mike Carr. With Mullen also on hand and Mark Taylor on drums, Good Times &amp; The Blues from 1993 ranks as some of the finest organ jazz recorded outside the US. Throughout his career Morrissey was always in demand as a saxophonist on the recording circuit. In the 1980s he worked with Peter Gabriel and Roy Harper; with Paul McCartney on The Long and Winding Road; and on the soundtrack of Ridley Scott's Bladerunner. For some time he lived in Portugal. For Morrissey's last years, cancer confined him to a wheelchair and public appearances were understandably rare. Occasionally, he delighted fans by performing at his local pub in Deal, Kent, sometimes with his son Jasper on drums. A few weeks ago the last Morrissey-Mullen line-up, including vocalist Noel McCalla and Pete Jacobsen on keyboards, was revived for a concert at Deal's Astor Theatre. \u0095 Dick Morrissey, musician, born May 9 1940; died November 8 2000",

      "body": "<p>T he town of Cholula in Mexico is dominated by a picturesque Spanish church on a hilltop. When the Spaniards arrived in the area they, along with many of Cholula's indigenous residents, assumed the hill was a natural feature of the landscape. But they were wrong. What they were building on was the overgrown and much-decayed remnant of a pyramid abandoned centuries earlier. Although not nearly as lofty as the great pyramid of Cheops in Egypt, the pyramid of Cholula covered a far greater area - so huge that it was taken to be a part of the scenery. </p> <p>There is a lesson here that archaeologists are beginning to apply more generally in the neotropics - the species-rich region of tropical central and south America. When we encounter seemingly primitive peoples living on a savannah or in a rainforest that looks as though it came straight out of Tarzan or the Lion King, we assume that they are somehow \"in tune\" with nature and have learned to live as innocents in a pristine habitat that we westerners disturb at our peril. </p> <p>So far, so wrong - and so patronising. For it turns out that these locals live in a landscape they have managed and manicured with some success for thousands of years. It may look like a jungle to us but it is, in reality, a completely human construct. The lie is given by the productivity of a system capable of supporting denser populations than could be sustained by simple hunting and gathering or, as it happens, by the western habit of cattle ranching. Do not think of Amazonia as a wilderness: think of it, instead, as a botanical garden. </p> <p>In today's Nature, the landscape archaeologist Clark Erickson of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, reports on more than 500 square kilometres of tree-dotted savannah in the Baure region of the Bolivian Amazon, inland from the better-known high-altitude Inca heartland in the Andes. </p> <p>To the casual observer it is Amazonia au naturel , but Erickson's tutored gaze sees the hand of man wherever he looks. In the few hundred years before the Spanish conquest, Amazonian contemporaries of the Incas tailored this landscape to suit their every comfort. \"Rather than domesticate the species they exploited,\" says Erickson, \"the people of Baure domesticated the landscape.\" </p> <p>Erickson's savannah is contoured by a dense, interconnecting network of earthen causeways, settlement mounds, raised fields, and thousands of kilo metres of ridges, up to two metres across and half-a-metre high, that zig-zag across the landscape. These ridges are too narrow and wind too crazily to have been roads or even paths, and are often broken by V-shaped incisions, associated with ponds. What are these mysterious ridges? On the basis of their location and form, and comparisons with practices seen elsewhere in south America, Erickson has inferred their use: fishing. </p> <p>This seems odd, given that the savannah is, most of the time, dry grassland. However, during the wet season, the Amazon and its tributaries burst their banks and spread across the landscape. The zig-zag ridges, built up with vegetation, rocks and even basketwork, would have made effective fish weirs, yielding enough protein to support a substantial population. The zig-zags would also have hindered water from draining back into the rivers at the end of the rains, creating ponds that could have been exploited well into the dry season. Today, savannah ponds associated with the zig-zag ridges may last all year round. They teem with fish and edible snails, and the oasis-like surroundings encourage the growth of palm trees. Palms yield nutritious fruits as well as timber and fibre. Even rotting palm logs have uses, as nurseries for protein-rich grubs of the palm beetle. </p> <p>The ponds and associated vegetation would have been magnets for a variety of game. So rather than going hunting, the fish-trapping Amazonians let the wildlife come to them. To the western eye, it looks lush and natural. </p> <p>The reality is rather different. \"In the past 12,000 years,\" says Erickson, \"indigenous peoples transformed the environment, creating what we now recognise as the rich ecological mosaic of the neotropics.\" </p> <p>Twelve millennia seems like an exaggeration given that Erickson has carbon-dated his fish weirs to the 15th and early 16th centuries. Hyperbole? Apparently not. Other researchers in the neotropics are coming to realise that the region has been one large garden for thousands of years. Native Americans are known to have cultivated many plants for their starchy roots and tubers for a long time. The potato, for example, is a neotropical native. </p> <p>However, suggestions that many of these plants were first grown in tropical forests have been controversial, partly because it is hard to find convincing remains of roots and tubers in archaeological sediments from the humid tropics. It is no accident that archaeologists (palaeontologists too, for that matter) prefer to go digging in dry deserts. But Dolores Piperno, of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama, and colleagues have overcome these problems. In Nature on October 19, they showed how manioc, yams, arrowroot and maize were cultivated in the jungles of Panama as long as 5,000 years ago. </p> <p>This turns conventional wisdom on its head: far from the last wilderness, the rainforest could have been the birthplace of neotropical agriculture. If so, it is likely that the range of what we think of as \"wild\" species in rainforests, and their ecological associations, have been shaped by human practices for many thousands of years. </p> <p>\u0095 Henry Gee is a senior editor of Nature.</p>",

      "bodyText": "T he town of Cholula in Mexico is dominated by a picturesque Spanish church on a hilltop. When the Spaniards arrived in the area they, along with many of Cholula's indigenous residents, assumed the hill was a natural feature of the landscape. But they were wrong. What they were building on was the overgrown and much-decayed remnant of a pyramid abandoned centuries earlier. Although not nearly as lofty as the great pyramid of Cheops in Egypt, the pyramid of Cholula covered a far greater area - so huge that it was taken to be a part of the scenery. There is a lesson here that archaeologists are beginning to apply more generally in the neotropics - the species-rich region of tropical central and south America. When we encounter seemingly primitive peoples living on a savannah or in a rainforest that looks as though it came straight out of Tarzan or the Lion King, we assume that they are somehow \"in tune\" with nature and have learned to live as innocents in a pristine habitat that we westerners disturb at our peril. So far, so wrong - and so patronising. For it turns out that these locals live in a landscape they have managed and manicured with some success for thousands of years. It may look like a jungle to us but it is, in reality, a completely human construct. The lie is given by the productivity of a system capable of supporting denser populations than could be sustained by simple hunting and gathering or, as it happens, by the western habit of cattle ranching. Do not think of Amazonia as a wilderness: think of it, instead, as a botanical garden. In today's Nature, the landscape archaeologist Clark Erickson of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, reports on more than 500 square kilometres of tree-dotted savannah in the Baure region of the Bolivian Amazon, inland from the better-known high-altitude Inca heartland in the Andes. To the casual observer it is Amazonia au naturel , but Erickson's tutored gaze sees the hand of man wherever he looks. In the few hundred years before the Spanish conquest, Amazonian contemporaries of the Incas tailored this landscape to suit their every comfort. \"Rather than domesticate the species they exploited,\" says Erickson, \"the people of Baure domesticated the landscape.\" Erickson's savannah is contoured by a dense, interconnecting network of earthen causeways, settlement mounds, raised fields, and thousands of kilo metres of ridges, up to two metres across and half-a-metre high, that zig-zag across the landscape. These ridges are too narrow and wind too crazily to have been roads or even paths, and are often broken by V-shaped incisions, associated with ponds. What are these mysterious ridges? On the basis of their location and form, and comparisons with practices seen elsewhere in south America, Erickson has inferred their use: fishing. This seems odd, given that the savannah is, most of the time, dry grassland. However, during the wet season, the Amazon and its tributaries burst their banks and spread across the landscape. The zig-zag ridges, built up with vegetation, rocks and even basketwork, would have made effective fish weirs, yielding enough protein to support a substantial population. The zig-zags would also have hindered water from draining back into the rivers at the end of the rains, creating ponds that could have been exploited well into the dry season. Today, savannah ponds associated with the zig-zag ridges may last all year round. They teem with fish and edible snails, and the oasis-like surroundings encourage the growth of palm trees. Palms yield nutritious fruits as well as timber and fibre. Even rotting palm logs have uses, as nurseries for protein-rich grubs of the palm beetle. The ponds and associated vegetation would have been magnets for a variety of game. So rather than going hunting, the fish-trapping Amazonians let the wildlife come to them. To the western eye, it looks lush and natural. The reality is rather different. \"In the past 12,000 years,\" says Erickson, \"indigenous peoples transformed the environment, creating what we now recognise as the rich ecological mosaic of the neotropics.\" Twelve millennia seems like an exaggeration given that Erickson has carbon-dated his fish weirs to the 15th and early 16th centuries. Hyperbole? Apparently not. Other researchers in the neotropics are coming to realise that the region has been one large garden for thousands of years. Native Americans are known to have cultivated many plants for their starchy roots and tubers for a long time. The potato, for example, is a neotropical native. However, suggestions that many of these plants were first grown in tropical forests have been controversial, partly because it is hard to find convincing remains of roots and tubers in archaeological sediments from the humid tropics. It is no accident that archaeologists (palaeontologists too, for that matter) prefer to go digging in dry deserts. But Dolores Piperno, of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama, and colleagues have overcome these problems. In Nature on October 19, they showed how manioc, yams, arrowroot and maize were cultivated in the jungles of Panama as long as 5,000 years ago. This turns conventional wisdom on its head: far from the last wilderness, the rainforest could have been the birthplace of neotropical agriculture. If so, it is likely that the range of what we think of as \"wild\" species in rainforests, and their ecological associations, have been shaped by human practices for many thousands of years. \u0095 Henry Gee is a senior editor of Nature.",

In the 1950s Baarov\u00e1 acted in several Italian and Spanish films, including Federico Fellini's I Vitelloni (1953). She divorced in 1956, moved to Salzburg and took Austrian citizenship. In 1970 she married a Salzburg gynaecologist, Kurt Lundwall, who was 20 years her senior; he died three years later. She had returned to the stage in 1960 in D\u00fcsseldorf. But even in Austria many never forgave her. In 1967, at the Graz theatre, she was met by groups of egg-throwing protesters. By 1975 she was appearing in the German stage version of Rainer Werner Fassbinder's The Bitter Tears of Petra Von Kant. Baarov\u00e1 was rediscovered in the 1990s. A film biography was shot in Salzburg in 1995. In later years she turned to drink, saying that her acquaintance with Goebbels had \"made my life hell\". Even in her final interviews three years ago, she denied that there had been an affair. Yet she appeared unrepentant, saying she had been \"young and naive\", and not remotely politically aware. \"I was not a Nazi, but like other women I was afraid to say no to such men,\" she said. About the Nazi crimes, she simply shrugged. \"I feel indifferent,\" she told me. \" I just want to forget the whole episode.\" Her autobiography, Escapes, was published in 1983; a second volume, The Soft Bitterness of Life, is due out soon. One of her last wishes had been to return to Prague, but she never managed it. Police found her body in her Salzburg flat. \u0095 Lida Baarov\u00e1 (Ludmila Babkova), actress, born May 12 1914; died October 27 2000",

Fusako Shigenobu, who is accused of masterminding several hijacks and hostage seizures in a long campaign said to be against capitalism, surrendered to detectives in Takatsuki, near Osaka, outside a hotel where she had checked in disguised as a man. The national police agency said she had been charged with hostage-taking during the 1974 seizure of the French embassy in the Hague in the Netherlands. Her arrest was hailed as a triumph of law enforcement. \"It's great that a person who has been involved in various terrorist acts since the late 60s has been arrested,\" the prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, said. Tokyo has been embarrassed on the international stage by the Red Army group, which Ms Shigenobu, a drop-out from the prestigious Meiji University, helped to establish in Lebanon in 1971 with the declared aim of fighting capitalism and the Israeli state - though the extorting of large cash payments also seemed close to its heart. Even at its peak the group had only 40 members, but it gained worldwide notoriety by acts of terrorism which often forced Japan and other big powers to make concessions. Its most bloody and indiscriminate assault was the 1972 grenade and gun attack on Tel Aviv's Lod airport, where 26 were killed and 80 injured. Ms Shigenobu's role in that action is unclear, but she is alleged to have helped to plan the hijacking of two planes and the seizure of two embassies between 1973 and 1977, acts that won the release of several prisoners and cash payments of millions of dollars. Working from havens in Lebanon, Syria, Libya and North Korea, the group remained active well into the 1980s. But with the end of the cold war many of its former state backers fall away. Its funds dried up, its refuges disappeared, its members aged. Ms Shigenobu's role in the movement earned her the nickname \"the empress\" in the 1970s. Her attractive looks and espousal of free love made her the pin-up of Japanese leftwing radicalism. Now 55, she looked more like a middle-aged housewife yesterday when police officers put her on a bullet train to Tokyo. Even so, she raised her handcuffed wrists to give a thumbs up, shouting: \"I'll fight on!\" She is the fourth member of the Red Army arrested this year. In March the police took three into custody at Narita airport, Tokyo after they had been expelled from Lebanon. The government hopes to extradite several others from North Korea, which is seeking economic aid, and the police agency says Ms Shigenobu may have information on about six still at large in Japan.

      "byline": "John Harper",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p> Twenty years on we can see the defects in the Conservatives' formula for privatisation and competition in telecoms - not as bad perhaps as the railways but still serious. I was in charge of the 1969 act that converted the old GPO into a Morrisonian nationalised industry. </p> <p>The sledgehammer monopoly I was perpetuating on Labour's instructions made me uncomfortable. By 1981 I was managing director of BT's inland operations. The Conservatives' preparations for privatisation made me much more uncomfortable, but there was nothing I could do. I left BT in 1983 but have continued to work in telecoms. </p> <p> BT's recent tribulations effectively spring from its failure to exploit the hugely growing cash flow and the R&amp;D capability it inherited from the public sector. BT still makes the running in this country and we have fallen behind developed countries in technology and service innovation. The nationalised industry had world-class mileage - Prestel, the forerunner of the internet, was a celebrated example. </p> <p>Since privatisation, BT has tamely followed where others have led. The reasons are obvious. Just like the railways, short-term stock-market pressures have provided a direct disincentive to investment. The price-cap system used for BT and other utilities was presented as promoting \"efficency\" while leaving profits unconstrained - an extraordinary kind of regulation. </p> <p>The real objective was to push up the share price and get Conservative ex-ministers seats on boards. The reduction in BT manpower is held up as proof that the policy of capping price increases works. This is phoney. BT's manpower actually increased to a peak six years after privatisation in 1990. </p> <p>It then contracted simply because the workload dropped as a result of falling growth and the completion of the modernisation programme of the nationalised industry.

      "bodyText": "Twenty years on we can see the defects in the Conservatives' formula for privatisation and competition in telecoms - not as bad perhaps as the railways but still serious. I was in charge of the 1969 act that converted the old GPO into a Morrisonian nationalised industry. The sledgehammer monopoly I was perpetuating on Labour's instructions made me uncomfortable. By 1981 I was managing director of BT's inland operations. The Conservatives' preparations for privatisation made me much more uncomfortable, but there was nothing I could do. I left BT in 1983 but have continued to work in telecoms. BT's recent tribulations effectively spring from its failure to exploit the hugely growing cash flow and the R&amp;D capability it inherited from the public sector. BT still makes the running in this country and we have fallen behind developed countries in technology and service innovation. The nationalised industry had world-class mileage - Prestel, the forerunner of the internet, was a celebrated example. Since privatisation, BT has tamely followed where others have led. The reasons are obvious. Just like the railways, short-term stock-market pressures have provided a direct disincentive to investment. The price-cap system used for BT and other utilities was presented as promoting \"efficency\" while leaving profits unconstrained - an extraordinary kind of regulation. The real objective was to push up the share price and get Conservative ex-ministers seats on boards. The reduction in BT manpower is held up as proof that the policy of capping price increases works. This is phoney. BT's manpower actually increased to a peak six years after privatisation in 1990. It then contracted simply because the workload dropped as a result of falling growth and the completion of the modernisation programme of the nationalised industry. And the price cap helped depress investment by putting a premium on minimising capital charges on current account. The claims for the effects of competition in network telecoms do not stand up either. Oftel recently announced that in a comparison with France, Germany, Sweden, Italy and two US states, British prices for business communications came out unexpectedly high. Competition from the cable companies can hardly be said to have stimulated BT, for they have been struggling for years, hampered by burdens of idle investment forced on them by Conservative governments obsessed by the idea of infrastructure competition. This business of having competing local telecoms' infrastructures provides a remarkable example of how the Conservatives substitute ideology for industry logic. The loss of economies of scale due to network duplication is so high and the usage per telephone line so persistently low that even with the extra business from cable TV, the resulting idle capital burden can never be absorbed by operating economies. The cable companies have found this out to their cost. Radio has come to the rescue of the consumer, but the unnecessary cost of infrastructure competition will dog wire service for a long time. Telecoms is suffering from the same lousy structure created by the Conservatives for the railways. When they took over in 1979, BT was already too big and diverse to manage properly. I began a subdivision process in 1982, reversed after I left. The stock market wanted a nice big monolith with nice big profit figures. The present wired service set up of rival vertical firms providing networks and services goes back to Alexander Graham Bell. It is bogging down the internet and new economy in endless squabbles and delays. BT is at last in the mood to subdivide, and should get on with it. How about New Year's Day as a deadline? This will provide an unrepeatable opportunity to get the structure of the industry right. Oftel is pointing the way. We need to push unbundling to its logical conclusion. We must completely separate services and retailing from network provision and operation. Then it will be necessary to free up all services to deregulated competition; re-unify the wired network infrastructure nationally and hammer out a \"third way\" ownership formula. If the firms won't co-operate, government should intervene. \u0095 John Harper's book Monopoly And Competition In British Telecommunications is published by Pinters (Cassells)",

Though economic growth and household consumption will be slightly lower than this year' s figures of 3% and 3.5% - the easing will be modest while inflation is expected to be bang on target, according to Gordon Brown. Even Britain's hard pressed manufacturing industry is on the road to modest recovery though still lagging the more buoyant services sector. Despite higher oil prices and exchange rate uncertainty the chancellor argues that the government has set the framework in place for sustainable improvement. Manufacturing output, which stagnated last year, is set to grow by 1.25% this year and then accelerate to up to 2.25% growth in 2001, with further, if slower growth in the following two years. In the pre-Budget report Mr Brown forecast that, after hitting 3% this year, gross domestic product should increase by between 2.25% and 2.75% in each of the next three years. That slight easing in the pace of growth should be enough to keep the economy on track to hit the inflation target over the medium term, according to the treasury but will not, however, be enough to prevent the economy from hitting Mr Brown's previous projections that it will pass the \u00a31,000bn mark in 2002.

However it believes that, though underlying earnings are growing at 4.1%, the increase can be sustained with out triggering inflation, because of productivity increases of around 2% a year. Mr Brown is predicting business investment to increase by between 2.25% and 2.75% by 2002, with spending as a proportion of GDP predicted to remain close to its recent record high. Nor is the chancellor ruling out a further push from spending on information and communications technology as firms roll out e-commerce strategies. The pre-Budget report shrugs of comparisons between the run down in the household savings ratio - from 10% in the mid-1990s to 5% last year and 3% in the second quarter of this year with a similar fall in the days of boom-and-bust in the late 1980s, citing \"structural and cyclical\" differences.

The proposals announced yesterday were driven by electoral rather than economic balancing. In Britain, as in Florida, the over-55s have numbers on their side. They account for half our electorate, and they are more likely than younger people to turn out to vote. In Britain, as in Florida, the state retirement pension and health care are key issues for older voters. But the health service and the state retirement pension are paid for by younger people who have jobs and cars, and they look to the government to deliver tax cuts, whether on their incomes or their fuel.</p> <p>This was a report aimed above all at pensioners, but also at road hauliers, working families and motorists. There was also good news for schools, small businesses, depressed areas, churches and campaigners against world poverty. The main reason why the chancellor's trade-offs are political rather than economic is that the economy is exceptionally healthy, following nearly eight years of continuous growth. Furthermore, the outlook remains promising. It has been possible simultaneously to tighten the overall fiscal stance, make large inroads into the national debt, cut some taxes and increase pension spending.</p> <p>Gordon Brown would have regarded the restraint he has made his colleagues show over the last few years as wasted if he had been obliged to respond to the pressures to give away more of his projected \u00a316bn surplus. If it is right to run deficits during recessions, it is right to run surpluses during booms. The deluge of the last two weeks will have served to remind the ever prudent chancellor that a rainy day will come along sooner or later. Having secured what appears to be a stable low-inflation environment for the first time since the 1973 oil price rises, he was not going to risk it by injecting a large and sudden increase in purchasing power.</p> <p>What is perhaps the most impressive thing about this report is that it appears to be more generous than it is. By responding to the concerns of the citizen as motorist, by cutting fuel duty for low-sulphur petrol and diesel and vehicle excise duty for small family cars (those between 1200 and 1500cc) the chancellor appears to be flexible and generous. But to the citizen as drinker, income tax or VAT payer there was no hint of relief. The political impetus to deliver now on a single key tax issue enabled him to avoid the potentially much bigger and more expensive challenge of universal tax cuts.</p> <p>Moreover, even the generosity to pensioners is not what it seems. Next April and the one after there will be pension increases which are large by the standards of recent years.

      "bodyText": "The parallels between the electoral cliffhanger in Florida and Gordon Brown's pre-Budget report are clear. The proposals announced yesterday were driven by electoral rather than economic balancing. In Britain, as in Florida, the over-55s have numbers on their side. They account for half our electorate, and they are more likely than younger people to turn out to vote. In Britain, as in Florida, the state retirement pension and health care are key issues for older voters. But the health service and the state retirement pension are paid for by younger people who have jobs and cars, and they look to the government to deliver tax cuts, whether on their incomes or their fuel. This was a report aimed above all at pensioners, but also at road hauliers, working families and motorists. There was also good news for schools, small businesses, depressed areas, churches and campaigners against world poverty. The main reason why the chancellor's trade-offs are political rather than economic is that the economy is exceptionally healthy, following nearly eight years of continuous growth. Furthermore, the outlook remains promising. It has been possible simultaneously to tighten the overall fiscal stance, make large inroads into the national debt, cut some taxes and increase pension spending. Gordon Brown would have regarded the restraint he has made his colleagues show over the last few years as wasted if he had been obliged to respond to the pressures to give away more of his projected \u00a316bn surplus. If it is right to run deficits during recessions, it is right to run surpluses during booms. The deluge of the last two weeks will have served to remind the ever prudent chancellor that a rainy day will come along sooner or later. Having secured what appears to be a stable low-inflation environment for the first time since the 1973 oil price rises, he was not going to risk it by injecting a large and sudden increase in purchasing power. What is perhaps the most impressive thing about this report is that it appears to be more generous than it is. By responding to the concerns of the citizen as motorist, by cutting fuel duty for low-sulphur petrol and diesel and vehicle excise duty for small family cars (those between 1200 and 1500cc) the chancellor appears to be flexible and generous. But to the citizen as drinker, income tax or VAT payer there was no hint of relief. The political impetus to deliver now on a single key tax issue enabled him to avoid the potentially much bigger and more expensive challenge of universal tax cuts. Moreover, even the generosity to pensioners is not what it seems. Next April and the one after there will be pension increases which are large by the standards of recent years. These are well above the likely increase in prices and earnings but future upratings of the basic state pension will continue to be made in line with prices. There are two reasons for this. The first, as pointed out by the chancellor, is that a growing proportion of pensioners have incomes above \u00a320,000 a year, about the level of average earnings. Restoring the earnings link would benefit this group as well as middle-income pensioners. Lower income pensioners would not benefit at all, since the increase would be offset by a reduction in means-tested benefits under the minimum income guarantee. The second reason is cost. The restoration of the earnings link has been estimated by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research to be the equivalent of an increase of 5p on income tax. Moreover, with a growing population of pensioners, the long-term financial commitment would be too great for any government to contemplate. The move from 2003 towards a system of support for older people - the pensioner tax credit - is designed to enable future governments to confine their generosity to middle and lower income pensioners. This is likely to lead to continuing erosion of the value of the basic state pension compared with an earnings-linked scheme. Overall, in terms of their economic impact, the plans outlined were entirely responsible. If they can also deliver for the government the support of motorists and pensioners, they will have achieved their true purpose.

      "bodyText": "Americans awake today still not knowing the identity of their next president and facing the possibility that Al Gore, who won most votes in Tuesday's election, will mount a supreme court challenge if the White House is awarded to George W Bush. Officials in Florida expect to complete the recount of their state's 6m votes by 5pm local time today, a task which will allow either Mr Bush or Mr Gore to lay claim to the most powerful elective office on the planet. Until that happens, America's vaunted electoral and constitutional system is in a state of suspended animation, with both of the presidential candidates stranded just short of the 270 electoral college votes that are required to win the White House. Mr Gore has captured 260 electoral college votes so far, with Mr Bush on 246 votes. Florida's winner-take-all 25 votes would take either man past the winning post, even though Oregon's seven votes remain undecided. Mr Gore held a 250,000 vote lead in the popular vote across the country. If Mr Bush becomes president it would be the first time since 1888 that the candidate who attracted most popular support had failed to become president - and the first time since women and black Americans won the right to vote. Gore officials said that discussions have been under way for several weeks within their office about the country's peculiar electoral college system. \"It is constitutional hot water,\" said a member of the team. \"There is obviously concern that you could have a situation where someone wins the popular vote but loses in a state where that has taken place,\" a Gore official said yesterday. The decision to recount in Florida followed the completion of a first count which showed Mr Bush only 1,655 votes ahead. Both sides dispatched heavyweight teams of officials to Florida to observe the conduct of the recount, which is being watched with amazement not just by Americans but by political leaders and television viewers around the globe. Mr Bush sent his father's former secretary of state, James Baker, while Mr Gore countered with another former holder of the same office, Warren Christopher, backed up by a 17-strong team of lawyers in Washington. Dramatic as the contest in Florida already is in the light of the recount, even this could be eclipsed if Mr Gore decides to launch a separate court challenge against alleged irregularities in the Florida election. The most prominent allegation being made yesterday was that hundreds of voters in Palm Beach county were issued with unorthodox ballot papers which meant they inadvertently voted for the conservative Pat Buchanan. The Rev Jesse Jackson also alleged that many Haitian Americans were denied their right to vote in neighbouring Broward county. There was a \"bad smell\" about the election result in Florida, Mr Jackson said, adding that foreign observers should be invited in to watch the count. Last night he and members of his Rainbow Coalition were organising a church meeting of voters in disputed precincts in the state. Mr Bush made a single public appearance with his running-mate, Dick Cheney, outside the Texas governor's mansion yesterday in which he did everything that he could to present himself as the president-in-waiting, ready to claim the office as soon as today's recount had been completed. \"This morning brings news from Florida that the final vote count there shows that Secretary Cheney and I have carried the state of Florida,\" Mr Bush began. \"And if that result is confirmed in an automatic recount, as we expect it will be, we have won the election.\" \"America has a long tradition of uniting once elections are over,\" Mr Bush continued. \"Secretary Cheney and I will do everything in our power to unite the nation, to call upon the best, to bring people together after one of the most exciting elections in our nation's history.\" The statesmanlike words masked one of the most pulsating and nerve-wracking election nights in American history, in which Mr Gore had already telephoned Mr Bush in Austin to concede the election before he was told of the Florida recount. He then called Mr Bush a second time to retract his concession. It was a night in which Mr Gore turned the tables on the late opinion polls by coming out ahead of Mr Bush in the popular vote, with 49% of the vote to Mr Bush's 48%, a margin of around 250,000 votes in a total national poll of 100m. The Green candidate, Ralph Nader, took 3%. If Mr Bush is confirmed as president it will cap a hat trick night for the Republicans, in which they just held on to the House of Representatives in spite of two Democrat gains, and in which they also retained control of the Senate by a whisker, in spite of a succession of losses. The dramatic decision to order a recount in Florida came in the early hours of yesterday morning and was the climax of an extraordinary night of changing fortunes for both camps. Within an hour of the close of polls in Florida, the US television networks had called the state for Mr Gore. Two hours later, following a tirade from Austin, the networks put Florida back in the toss-up category where it still remains today. The outcome in Oregon, where all the votes are cast by post, remained in doubt last night as counting continued there. Mr Bush's campaign also refused to concede that they had lost in New Mexico, saying that the postal vote there could swing the state back to them at the last minute. Turnout in the election was 51%, a slight increase on the 1996 figure of 49%, which was an all-time record low for a presidential election.",

Mr Rosen, whose new company Huntress Search, a net-based recruitment agency began trading this week, said yesterday's changes will make it easier to hire staff.</p> <p>Mr Rosen plans to hire about 150 employees over the next 12 months. Amid growing labour shortages, especially in IT, share options are becoming essential to the package used by start-ups to lure skilled workers.

Mr Rosen, whose new company Huntress Search, a net-based recruitment agency began trading this week, said yesterday's changes will make it easier to hire staff. Mr Rosen plans to hire about 150 employees over the next 12 months. Amid growing labour shortages, especially in IT, share options are becoming essential to the package used by start-ups to lure skilled workers. Until yesterday, Huntress was restrained by limits on start-up option schemes which allow the tax-privileged benefits to be given to only 15 employees. But Huntress, which started trading with 43 staff, already exceeded the ceiling.

      "body": "<p>As a jubilant Hillary Clinton celebrated her landmark victory in New York yesterday, friends of her husband back in his Arkansas hometown had little reason to cheer.</p> <p>Most Arkansans voted for George W Bush in a state poll that was not even particularly close. After eight years of \"A Man from Hope\" in the White House, local citizens were willing to elect the son of the man he defeated.</p> <p>In her victory speech, Mrs Clinton sought to end the intense bipartisan bitterness that characterised the New York and Arkansas races. \"I promise you tonight, I will reach across party lines to bring progress for all of New York's families,\" she said. \"Today we voted as Republicans and Democrats. Tomorrow we begin again as New Yorkers. I am determined to make a difference for all of you.\"</p> <p>A weeping President Clinton looked on silently as she thanked him and daughter Chelsea for their support. \"I would not be here without my family,\" she said. Mrs Clinton is the first wife of a president to be elected to the US Senate.</p> <p>Her victory, by a comfortable margin of 55% to 43%, will ensure that the most divisive family name in US politics will remain powerful long after her husband leaves office.</p> <p>The champagne and confetti in the New York ballroom seemed a million miles from Arkansas on election night, where the rain-soaked party faithful gathered amid tornado warnings to celebrate the slim victory of a Democrat who was standing for local office a few miles from the president's Hope birthplace.</p> <p>As Mike Ross, a Clinton acolyte, waited for the results of his bid for a house of representatives seat, even some of his supporters were willing to admit that they had voted for Mr Bush on Tuesday. George Ivey, who lives in nearby Prescott, said: \"I can't tell you what I really think [about Clinton] among all these Democrats. But I wouldn't vote for Gore because he's spent too much time with him.\"</p> <p>Mr Ivey and his wife had voted for Mr Ross because \"we've known him since he was a little-bitty boy and he's a good Christian\". Political pundits suggested yesterday that retribution for the Monica Lewinsky affair had helped Mr Bush to win a swath of southern states.</p> <p>Arkansas is increasingly proud of its place as the buckle of the bible belt. Signs along the road to Hope issue a stark warning that drivers should prepare to meet their god, and local citizens elected a Republican Baptist minister to follow Mr Clinton as state governor.</p> <p>Relations between the president and the state he left for Washington eight years ago have been strained for some time. But they have reached a nadir in this election year.</p> <p>Disgust at Mr Clinton's private life prompted an attempt to disbar him from legal practice in Arkansas that is still going through legal procedures. The president is understood to have threatened to withdraw plans to build a $125m library in the state capital if he is disbarred.</p> <p>Local Clinton opponents managed to present his presidency as both morally corrupt and bad for one of America's poorest states. Chris Carnahan, executive director of the state Republican party, said: \"The president has literally done nothing for Arkansas except bring down retribution.\"</p> <p>Mr Bush campaigned vigorously and successfully to turn this disaffection for the only Arkansan to become US president into an audacious bid for the state's six electoral college votes.</p> <p>But Mr Clinton still attracts an incredibly loyal band of supporters in his home state. Vaughn McQuary, the chairman of the Arkansas Democratic party, blames the unrelenting bitterness of his Republican rivals for some of the slurs. He is planning a big celebratory party after the inauguration and describes this year's elections - with its Clinton successes and defeats - as \"really bitter-sweet\".</p> <p>Joann Martin, who has known the Clintons since the mid 1970s and worked at campaign headquarters in Little Rock on election day, said: \"Of course, there were times when I was disappointed, but I have always compared it with raising my three sons. There were times when they didn't behave as well as they might, but it didn't mean that I quit loving or respecting them.\"</p> <p>As an afterthought, she added: \"Arkansas is better off as a result of his presidency and history will prove that.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "As a jubilant Hillary Clinton celebrated her landmark victory in New York yesterday, friends of her husband back in his Arkansas hometown had little reason to cheer. Most Arkansans voted for George W Bush in a state poll that was not even particularly close. After eight years of \"A Man from Hope\" in the White House, local citizens were willing to elect the son of the man he defeated. In her victory speech, Mrs Clinton sought to end the intense bipartisan bitterness that characterised the New York and Arkansas races. \"I promise you tonight, I will reach across party lines to bring progress for all of New York's families,\" she said. \"Today we voted as Republicans and Democrats. Tomorrow we begin again as New Yorkers. I am determined to make a difference for all of you.\" A weeping President Clinton looked on silently as she thanked him and daughter Chelsea for their support. \"I would not be here without my family,\" she said. Mrs Clinton is the first wife of a president to be elected to the US Senate. Her victory, by a comfortable margin of 55% to 43%, will ensure that the most divisive family name in US politics will remain powerful long after her husband leaves office. The champagne and confetti in the New York ballroom seemed a million miles from Arkansas on election night, where the rain-soaked party faithful gathered amid tornado warnings to celebrate the slim victory of a Democrat who was standing for local office a few miles from the president's Hope birthplace. As Mike Ross, a Clinton acolyte, waited for the results of his bid for a house of representatives seat, even some of his supporters were willing to admit that they had voted for Mr Bush on Tuesday. George Ivey, who lives in nearby Prescott, said: \"I can't tell you what I really think [about Clinton] among all these Democrats. But I wouldn't vote for Gore because he's spent too much time with him.\" Mr Ivey and his wife had voted for Mr Ross because \"we've known him since he was a little-bitty boy and he's a good Christian\". Political pundits suggested yesterday that retribution for the Monica Lewinsky affair had helped Mr Bush to win a swath of southern states. Arkansas is increasingly proud of its place as the buckle of the bible belt. Signs along the road to Hope issue a stark warning that drivers should prepare to meet their god, and local citizens elected a Republican Baptist minister to follow Mr Clinton as state governor. Relations between the president and the state he left for Washington eight years ago have been strained for some time. But they have reached a nadir in this election year. Disgust at Mr Clinton's private life prompted an attempt to disbar him from legal practice in Arkansas that is still going through legal procedures. The president is understood to have threatened to withdraw plans to build a $125m library in the state capital if he is disbarred. Local Clinton opponents managed to present his presidency as both morally corrupt and bad for one of America's poorest states. Chris Carnahan, executive director of the state Republican party, said: \"The president has literally done nothing for Arkansas except bring down retribution.\" Mr Bush campaigned vigorously and successfully to turn this disaffection for the only Arkansan to become US president into an audacious bid for the state's six electoral college votes. But Mr Clinton still attracts an incredibly loyal band of supporters in his home state. Vaughn McQuary, the chairman of the Arkansas Democratic party, blames the unrelenting bitterness of his Republican rivals for some of the slurs. He is planning a big celebratory party after the inauguration and describes this year's elections - with its Clinton successes and defeats - as \"really bitter-sweet\". Joann Martin, who has known the Clintons since the mid 1970s and worked at campaign headquarters in Little Rock on election day, said: \"Of course, there were times when I was disappointed, but I have always compared it with raising my three sons. There were times when they didn't behave as well as they might, but it didn't mean that I quit loving or respecting them.\" As an afterthought, she added: \"Arkansas is better off as a result of his presidency and history will prove that.\"",

      "bodyText": "A report by experts investigating the crash of an Air France Concorde outside Paris in July contains potentially devastating evidence against the US carrier Continental Airlines and subcontractors in Israel, a newspaper alleged yesterday. Le Parisien cited a leaked report stating that Continental manifestly failed to ensure that proper maintenance procedures were followed in Israel when a strip of metal was fixed to the engine of one of its DC-10 jets. Three weeks later, this jet took off from from Charles de Gaulle airport just before the Concorde. Investigators have already said that the 16-inch piece of metal, found on the runway used by both planes, almost definitely brought the Concorde down by shredding one of its tyres. Chunks of rubber then hurtled into the aircraft's unprotected wings, puncturing one or more of its fuel tanks and igniting a fire that turned the supersonic jet into what one expert has described as \"a gigantic cigarette lighter\". Less than two minutes after take-off, the plane plunged into a hotel in nearby Gonesse, killing all 109 people on board and four on the ground. Le Parisien said the report, by metallurgical experts from the French government's Armaments Directorate General found microscopic traces of rubber on the epoxy-coated metal strip that matched the chemical composition of the Air France Concorde's tyres. The report confirmed that \"part 139\", a wear strip from an engine thrust reverser assembly, came from the forward starboard engine cowling of Continental Airlines' DC-10 flight 55, that it was not the original part supplied by the engine manufacturers General Electric, and that it had fallen off the same plane several times in the past. The refit alleged to have been deficient was carried out in Israel on July 9, three weeks before the Concorde crashed, the report said, apparently by engineers subcontracted by Continental. But it said General Electric's specifications were not followed. These say that only the 12 existing rivet holes should be used when refitting the strip.

Paralleling the closest presidential election in years, American voters have delivered finely balanced outcomes, but have left the Republicans with narrow majorities in both houses. The outcome is a big blow for the Democrats, who had set their sights on recapturing the House after six years, and who must now focus on using their blocking minority in the Senate in forthcoming legislative battles. With two Senate contests in Republican-held seats in Michigan and Washington state undecided, the Democrats still had hopes of achieving a 50-50 split in the 100-seat body, where the Republicans had a 54-46 majority before the election. The Democrat gains would not be enough to give the party control of the Senate, irrespective of the outcome in the battle for the White House.

      "bodyText": "Rules introduced to protect pension fund members after the Maxwell scandal should be scrapped and replaced with a more \"open and transparent\" regime, the head of a government-backed review into institutional investment recommended yesterday. Paul Myners, head of Gartmore fund management, outlined a three-pronged alternative to the so-called minimum funding requirement (MFR) which would involve extending fraud compensation, separating pension fund assets from the control of the company and requiring pension funds to issue public, \"transparency\" statements on their investment strategies. By scrapping the MFR, Mr Myners, who is chairman of Guardian Media Group, aims to enhance investor protection and free pension assets for investment in areas such as venture capital. MFR requirements have tended to encourage pension funds to invest a proportion of their assets in long-dated government bonds. Establishing fund managers' attitudes to investing in such venture capital was one of the main tasks given to Mr Myners when Gordon Brown asked him at the last Budget to review the way institutional investors take their decisions. Mr Myners' initial report was welcomed by the National Association of Pension Funds. The Association of British Insurers said the proposals would require a \"close examination of the role\" of Opra, the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority, with which Mr Myners says trustees' should lodge their transparency statements. Pensions consultants William Mercer expressed concerns that Mr Myners' proposals weaken the protection of members in pension funds. Gordon Pollock, worldwide partner at William M Mercer, said employers should be required to make a certain level of contribution if their schemes are underfunded. Mr Myners' call to abolish the MFR was regarded by Michael Saunders, economist at Schroder Salomon Smith Barney, as negative for long-dated government bonds. While Mr Myners has until the next Budget to publish his full findings, he said he was making his views on the controversial MFR known yesterday to coincide with two separate but related government consultation exercises. The first is on the MFR, which Mr Myners described yesterday as \"seriously inadequate as a form of protection\". The second is the impact of financial services regulation on investment by pension funds in so-called limited partnerships, one of the structures by which investors could back entrepreneurs. The government said yesterday that it would incorporate Mr Myners' recommended changes to the legislation under the Financial Services and Markets Act to change investment restrictions on pension funds to make it easier to invest in these limited partnerships. However, Mr Myners' suggestions for the eradication of the MFR, which dismisses many other proposals drawn up the industry such as setting up insurance policies, may not be adopted by the government, which yesterday said it would consult with the industry on the ideas. The proposals for reforming the MFR follow submissions to Mr Myners' consultation paper which led him to conclude that the existing rules, put in place after the Robert Maxwell affair, were distorting investment strategies. Mr Myners said MFR, which he contended was \"never designed to tackle fraud\", was encouraging employees to move away from offering defined benefit pension schemes linked to employees' final salaries. He said the MFR had given pension fund trustees a false sense of security and weakened their sense of \"fiduciary duty\". His new proposals, particularly for final salary schemes to set out in \"clear and straightforward language\" the details of their investment strategies, are expected to put greater onus on trustees. What happens next By the time of the Budget next year, Paul Myners, the fund manager who is heading the government-backed review into institutional investment, is expected to provide Gordon Brown with an outline of how investment professionals make decisions about where to place their assets. The industry also believes Mr Myners will set out ideas for placing greater responsibility on pension fund trustees. Mr Myners has indicated that the final report to the chancellor would be the avenue by which he suggested the time frames and methods under which pension fund performance should be measured. Annual performance measurement has been cited as one of the reasons for deterring investment in venture capital because it can be more volatile.

Bill Daley, the urbane Gore campaign chairman, appeared on the podium where Mr Gore had been about to speak. \"I don't think there has ever been a night like this,\" he told the suddenly enthused crowd. Mr Daley, credited with holding the campaign together during its darker days, said that with 99.99% of nearly 6m votes counted, the candidates were separated by a mere 1,200 votes.

Rumours floated up and down the staircase leading to the nerve centre of the hotel.</p> <p>There was a missing ballot box. The absentee ballots came mainly from a Democrat stronghold.

Then, as in all good cowboy movies, came the last-minute reprieve, although this was one that Governor Bush would certainly not have wanted to sign. He is not known for pardons. No studio executive would have bought this plot, said film director and Democrat cheerleader Robert Reiner who was in the square. \"Truth is stranger than fiction,\" he said as the vice-president's limousine took a last minute detour from what would have been his concession speech and headed back to his hotel to his first sleep in 48 hours.

      "body": "<p>The television presenter Paula Yates died of a heroin overdose in a \"foolish and incautious\" binge after having apparently overcome her drug problem, an inquest found yesterday.</p> <p>The coroner, Paul Knapman, said the amount she snorted would not have killed an addict, but as \"an unsophisticated taker of heroin\" Miss Yates had no tolerance to the drug.</p> <p>Recording a verdict of death by non-dependent abuse of drugs, he told the court: \"The evidence does not point to this being a deliberate act of suicide. It seems most improbable that she would attempt to kill herself with her daughter in the house. Her behaviour was foolish and incautious.\"</p> <p>Miss Yates, 41, died at her home in Notting Hill, west London, on September 17, after moving back from a break in Hastings.</p> <p>The last adult to see her was a former heroin addict she had met at the Priory clinic, but her four-year-old daughter Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily, whose father Michael Hutchence died three years ago, was alone with her when she died.</p> <p>Pathologist Iain West told the court he had found morphine in her blood, but no trace of alcohol or other illegal drugs. \"The powerful narcotic drug depressed the cells of the brain which basically stopped her breathing,\" he said.</p> <p>Miss Yates's close friend Belinda Brewin, who visited her on the evening before her death, told the court: \"She was slightly staggering, her eyelids were drooping, she was slightly incoherent. I could tell that she had been taking drugs.</p> <p>\"I said, 'What the hell are you doing this for after all this time?' She hadn't taken drugs, illegal drugs, for nearly two years. She said it was the pressure of being back in London.\"</p> <p>After bathing Miss Yates because she had been sick, Mrs Brewin left the star in a \"quite coherent\" state. Unknown to Mrs Brewin, Charlotte Korshak, a former heroin addict, was upstairs throughout the visit and was the last person to see Miss Yates.</p> <p>Miss Korshak, 21, told police that Miss Yates had taken heroin, cocaine, ecstasy and acid \"from time to time\".</p> <p>But she said she did not see Miss Yates take any drugs on September 16 and when asked by the coroner if she had supplied Miss Yates with illegal drugs replied: \"Absolutely not.\" She told the court she left her friend \"fine, in a really good mood, happy\".</p> <p>Miss Yates's body was found by her longstanding friend Josephine Fairley Sams, who visited the house after trying to call her repeatedly. She was let in by Tiger Lily. \"I rushed upstairs to tell Paula to wake up and took one look at her and knew she was dead,\" she told the court.</p> <p>\"She was naked, half-out of the bed. I touched her and she was very cold.\"</p> <p>Miss Yates found fame in the 1980s as co-presenter of Channel 4 show The Tube, and as girlfriend and later wife of Sir Bob Geldof. They had three children - Fifi Trixibelle, 17, Peaches, 11, and Pixie, 10 - but in 1995 she left him for INXS singer Michael Hutchence. An acrimonious divorce and custody battle followed.</p> <p>Amid a blaze of headlines she gave birth to Hutchence's daughter, Tiger Lily. But only 14 months later he was found hanged by a belt in his Sydney hotel room in November 1997. Miss Yates refused to accept the coroner's verdict of suicide. Her life was rocked again when it was revealed that her father was not the late TV presenter Jess Yates, as she had believed, but another TV personality, the late Hughie Green. Following Miss Yates's death Tiger Lily was made a ward of court and is being cared for by Sir Bob, who already had custody of his three children.</p> <p>After the inquest Miss Yates's solicitor, Anthony Burton, read a statement on behalf of her friends. \"An inquest tells you how someone died, not how they lived. It gives no clue to the fullness and joy of Paula's life. Her friends will always remember her as loving, affectionate and witty.\"</p>",

The coroner, Paul Knapman, said the amount she snorted would not have killed an addict, but as \"an unsophisticated taker of heroin\" Miss Yates had no tolerance to the drug. Recording a verdict of death by non-dependent abuse of drugs, he told the court: \"The evidence does not point to this being a deliberate act of suicide. It seems most improbable that she would attempt to kill herself with her daughter in the house. Her behaviour was foolish and incautious.\" Miss Yates, 41, died at her home in Notting Hill, west London, on September 17, after moving back from a break in Hastings. The last adult to see her was a former heroin addict she had met at the Priory clinic, but her four-year-old daughter Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily, whose father Michael Hutchence died three years ago, was alone with her when she died. Pathologist Iain West told the court he had found morphine in her blood, but no trace of alcohol or other illegal drugs. \"The powerful narcotic drug depressed the cells of the brain which basically stopped her breathing,\" he said. Miss Yates's close friend Belinda Brewin, who visited her on the evening before her death, told the court: \"She was slightly staggering, her eyelids were drooping, she was slightly incoherent. I could tell that she had been taking drugs. \"I said, 'What the hell are you doing this for after all this time?' She hadn't taken drugs, illegal drugs, for nearly two years. She said it was the pressure of being back in London.\" After bathing Miss Yates because she had been sick, Mrs Brewin left the star in a \"quite coherent\" state. Unknown to Mrs Brewin, Charlotte Korshak, a former heroin addict, was upstairs throughout the visit and was the last person to see Miss Yates. Miss Korshak, 21, told police that Miss Yates had taken heroin, cocaine, ecstasy and acid \"from time to time\". But she said she did not see Miss Yates take any drugs on September 16 and when asked by the coroner if she had supplied Miss Yates with illegal drugs replied: \"Absolutely not.\" She told the court she left her friend \"fine, in a really good mood, happy\". Miss Yates's body was found by her longstanding friend Josephine Fairley Sams, who visited the house after trying to call her repeatedly. She was let in by Tiger Lily. \"I rushed upstairs to tell Paula to wake up and took one look at her and knew she was dead,\" she told the court. \"She was naked, half-out of the bed. I touched her and she was very cold.\" Miss Yates found fame in the 1980s as co-presenter of Channel 4 show The Tube, and as girlfriend and later wife of Sir Bob Geldof. They had three children - Fifi Trixibelle, 17, Peaches, 11, and Pixie, 10 - but in 1995 she left him for INXS singer Michael Hutchence. An acrimonious divorce and custody battle followed. Amid a blaze of headlines she gave birth to Hutchence's daughter, Tiger Lily. But only 14 months later he was found hanged by a belt in his Sydney hotel room in November 1997. Miss Yates refused to accept the coroner's verdict of suicide. Her life was rocked again when it was revealed that her father was not the late TV presenter Jess Yates, as she had believed, but another TV personality, the late Hughie Green. Following Miss Yates's death Tiger Lily was made a ward of court and is being cared for by Sir Bob, who already had custody of his three children. After the inquest Miss Yates's solicitor, Anthony Burton, read a statement on behalf of her friends. \"An inquest tells you how someone died, not how they lived. It gives no clue to the fullness and joy of Paula's life. Her friends will always remember her as loving, affectionate and witty.\"",

I want to confess to being a violator. </p> <p>Before retirement, I ran a hi-tech company. I bought the kit, paid the mortgage, the electricity and the phone bills. I offered work in a congenial, sociable atmosphere. I deliberately paid 25% over the going rate. In return, I expected our employees to work hard, and allowed them free use of email, phone lines and internet. </p> <p>Mostly this situation of trust worked. Sometimes it didn't and I had to violate some human rights. On one occasion, a woman who started \"work\" early (we ran a trust-based flexitime system) was found to be on the phone to her boyfriend for an hour every day, before the rest of us got in. I abused her rights by shouting at her. </p> <p>On another, a man who wanted to work into the nights on a \"personal\" project (I told you we were soft) ran up a \u00a3150 phone bill downloading hardcore porn from foreign phone numbers. I abused his rights by taking the money off his wages. Oh, I am also an entirely unreconstructed (whatever that means) Marxist, and was the only paid-up union member in the company. <br> <strong> Allen Ives</strong> <br> <a href=\"mailto:allen.ives@which.net\">tony.troy@virgin.net</a> </p> <p><strong> (Un)civil rights</strong><br> Yet another story about nasty employers snooping on their employees' emails. </p> <p>Using internet resources provided for work for personal reasons costs money - in wasted time that could be spent actually working - in ISDN dial-up charges and/or bandwidth. It would be difficult to hide a 30-minute personal phone call but someone can easily surf the web or send out tens of megabytes in email attachments through a central server and incur the same, or greater, costs without drawing any attention. </p> <p>An off-colour message sent to the wrong person can expose a company to legal action and cost thousands of pounds in damages. These are real costs and real risks. </p> <p>If people are concerned about their civil liberties being infringed, they should send their (un)civil emails from home. There should be no expectation of privacy on their employers' premises, using their employers' computers and running up their employers' phone bill. <br> <strong> Robert Lawrence</strong> <br> <a href=\"mailto:monged@ntlworld.com\">monged@ntlworld.com</a> </p> <p> <strong> Desperate bid</strong> <br> I am surprised nobody has suggested the obvious reason for hacking into Microsoft's source code.

At a Commonwealth level, there is a requirement that websites meet standards by December. </p> <p>One of the difficulties in meeting these standards is the lack of a good knowledge base about the practicalities of such standards, which at first sight appear abstruse. </p> <p>With the disability charity Vision Australia, Vicnet is one of the few organisations providing training workshops for government webmasters, and many webmasters have now been offered training and support. Workshops have also been offered in New Zealand. </p> <p>It would be useful if the practical training sessions such as those we have developed were also held in the UK and other countries, or else the standards will continue to seem theoretical, and excuses for non-implementation of even basic accessibility techniques will still be made. <br> <strong> Larry Stillman</strong> <br> <a href=\"mailto:larrys@vicnet.net.au\">larrys@vicnet.net.au</a> </p> <p><strong> Vital vetting</strong><br> In response to Dr Mark Griffiths' letter expressing his concerns about pre-paid debit cards allowing children access to unsuitable goods and services on the net, while I cannot speak for other providers, I can point out that reputable card providers make it a priority to accept only e-retailers that provide suitable products to that particular demographic group. As each retailer has to be individually configured to accept our card system it is a simple matter of ensuring that only carefully researched and vetted online stores have access to the payment system and the children who use it. <strong> Matt Johnson </strong> <br> Eurospend Ltd <a href=\"mailto:seanstewart30@hotmail.com\">seanstewart30@hotmail.com</a> </p> <p><strong> Biggles credit</strong><br> To give credit where due, the Biggles illustration in Online (November 2) was drawn by Mike Western, taken from the Biggles strip which he drew in 1961 for the weekly comic paper TV Express. <strong> David A Simpson</strong> <br> <a herf=\"mailto:david-a-simpson@beeb.net\">david-a-simpson@beeb.net</a> </p> <p><strong> Generation X</strong><br> In What's New (Online, November 2) you say \"UK phones are at the 1G (first generation) level with the first 2G systems based on GPRS just coming in to use\".

On one occasion, a woman who started \"work\" early (we ran a trust-based flexitime system) was found to be on the phone to her boyfriend for an hour every day, before the rest of us got in. I abused her rights by shouting at her. On another, a man who wanted to work into the nights on a \"personal\" project (I told you we were soft) ran up a \u00a3150 phone bill downloading hardcore porn from foreign phone numbers. I abused his rights by taking the money off his wages. Oh, I am also an entirely unreconstructed (whatever that means) Marxist, and was the only paid-up union member in the company. Allen Ives tony.troy@virgin.net (Un)civil rights Yet another story about nasty employers snooping on their employees' emails. Using internet resources provided for work for personal reasons costs money - in wasted time that could be spent actually working - in ISDN dial-up charges and/or bandwidth. It would be difficult to hide a 30-minute personal phone call but someone can easily surf the web or send out tens of megabytes in email attachments through a central server and incur the same, or greater, costs without drawing any attention. An off-colour message sent to the wrong person can expose a company to legal action and cost thousands of pounds in damages. These are real costs and real risks. If people are concerned about their civil liberties being infringed, they should send their (un)civil emails from home. There should be no expectation of privacy on their employers' premises, using their employers' computers and running up their employers' phone bill.

Richard Page richardpage@veg-edible.clara.co.uk Equal battle The article Battle to be Equal (Online November 2), needs to be framed in the broader context of the recognition of the rights of people with disabilities under disabilities legislation in Australia. The Online Council of Australian Ministers has agreed to the adoption of internationally recognised standards such as those developed by the world wide web consortium accessibility initiative ( www.w3.org/wai ). At a Commonwealth level, there is a requirement that websites meet standards by December. One of the difficulties in meeting these standards is the lack of a good knowledge base about the practicalities of such standards, which at first sight appear abstruse. With the disability charity Vision Australia, Vicnet is one of the few organisations providing training workshops for government webmasters, and many webmasters have now been offered training and support. Workshops have also been offered in New Zealand. It would be useful if the practical training sessions such as those we have developed were also held in the UK and other countries, or else the standards will continue to seem theoretical, and excuses for non-implementation of even basic accessibility techniques will still be made. Larry Stillman larrys@vicnet.net.au Vital vetting In response to Dr Mark Griffiths' letter expressing his concerns about pre-paid debit cards allowing children access to unsuitable goods and services on the net, while I cannot speak for other providers, I can point out that reputable card providers make it a priority to accept only e-retailers that provide suitable products to that particular demographic group. As each retailer has to be individually configured to accept our card system it is a simple matter of ensuring that only carefully researched and vetted online stores have access to the payment system and the children who use it.

David A Simpson david-a-simpson@beeb.net Generation X In What's New (Online, November 2) you say \"UK phones are at the 1G (first generation) level with the first 2G systems based on GPRS just coming in to use\". In fact GSM, which is widely used today, is a 2G standard. First generation cellular networks employed analog transmission. 2G networks are digital. GPRS is a 2.5G standard, an intermediate standard to 3G. Philip Walsh philiprwalsh@supanet.com",

      "body": "<p>While the internet is taking over the earth, Dr Vinton Gray Cerf - Vint, for short - is working to extend it to the rest of the solar system. And while Cerf is known for his sense of humour, this is not a joke. He's working with Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory to make it a reality. </p> <p>\"We've designed a whole new set of protocols to augment the existing internet protocols, so we could effectively build a network of internets,\" says Cerf. \"We put interplanetary gateways in orbit around the planets and satellites, and we run these new interplanetary networks through deep space. That's a very practical way of reducing costs in the interplanetary research effort. </p> <p>\"And the UK has a critical role in this,\" he adds. \"It is going to be launching the STRV 1D research satellite in the middle of November, and it will be carrying our interplanetary protocols. We've just finished implementing the prototypes, and they work! </p> <p>\"Then there's a moon launch that is possible at the end of 2001, with a lander on it, and that's going to carry the interplanetary internet protocols. Then we are scheduled to be on two Nasa missions to Mars, to land on the planet. </p> <p>\"After that we have missions to launch satellites around Mars: those will become the backbone of a two-planet internet. From there we expand outwards: as each mission goes to the outer planets, they'll carry a little bit of the internet with them. It's like living in a science fiction novel! There's a practical reason for doing all this, but it's also just plain fun.\" </p> <p>Being the father of the internet, founding president of the Internet Society, recipient of the US National Medal of Technology and other awards, and senior vice president of internet architecture and technology for WorldCom, has never stopped Cerf having fun. For example, when taking part in a \"shoot-out\" with Bob Metcalfe, the inventor of Ethernet networking, at an industry trade show in 1998, he donned a cowboy hat and a couple of (holstered) six-guns. </p> <p>During a heated argument at an Internet Engineering Task Force meeting about the future of the Internet Protocol (IP), the basis of internet communications, in 1992, Cerf stripped down to a T-shirt bearing the words \"IP on Everything\". He's serious about what the slogan means, but he still chuckles about the pun. \"Now everyone wants to put whatever they have on top of the internet, I should have a new T-shirt made that says 'IP Under Everything',\" he says. </p> <p>Not even posing for the Guardian's photographer, for this article, dented his good humour. When he saw I was suffering some strain from holding Frank Baron's light, he suggested that if I did a good job I might be promoted to a hat stand. Anyone with a fraction of Cerf's achievements could easily have become self-important, but he has down-to-earth ways of defusing tension and generating camaraderie that must have been priceless in the net's early days. </p> <p>Which is not to say the early days have gone, because Cerf is still building the future. In the 1990s, for example, he was promoting the expansion of the number of internet addresses [IP numbers] available. When most people still didn't know what the internet was, he wanted an internet address for every electron on the planet. Now people are finally catching on to the idea of the internet being everywhere, he's pushing into space. </p> <p>This is not just to solve Nasa's communications problems, but to answer the question Cerf asked himself: \"What should I be doing now, that we'll need 20 years from now? One answer is that maybe some day we will need a commercial backbone that is interplanetary in scope, and we'd better be ready, technologically,\" he says. \"We don't have to build all of it right away, but I want to know how to build it.\" </p> <p>As he points out, the internet also started as a long-term research project with practical near-term goals. It began in 1969 when Arpanet, the Advanced Research Projects Agency network, was set up by the US Defence Department as a way of sharing expensive computing facilities between universities. Cerf helped to develop it when he was a graduate student at the University of California at Los Angeles, and then at Stanford University, after he joined the faculty in 1972. </p> <p>The Arpanet was innovative, being based on a packet-switching system conceived earlier by Paul Baran (ie, it works like the postal service, except the packets are computer data rather than physical letters and parcels). But not everyone could be on the Arpanet, and there was the bigger problem of connecting different networks together. The world needed an internetworking system, or internet. That's what Cerf and Arpa's Bob Kahn described in a paper published in 1974, and their TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) system made the internet what it is today. </p> <p>Cerf joined Arpa in 1976 to manage the various research projects involved in implementing TCP/IP, and in 1983, it finally became mandatory as a way of moving internet data. This made Cerf, by popular acclaim, \"the Father of the Internet\". </p> <p>Cerf has sometimes resisted what he calls \"this figurehead notion\", and he is always ready to put forward the names of other people who helped create the internet. \"Things with this scale don't happen unless thousands of people are involved, and something that makes the internet valuable is that it makes it easy for people to contribute,\" he says. \"That collaborative aspect of the net is what contributes to its power.\" </p> <p>On the other hand, Cerf has also used his position to influence users, researchers, companies and governments, and at MCI WorldCom, where he works, to build high-speed internet backbones. Things that could have sounded outrageous coming from others were taken seriously by the US Defence Department, and by politicians such as Al Gore, because Cerf said them. </p> <p>\"Yes, there's a bully pulpit element to all this,\" Cerf says, borrowing a phrase President Theodore Roosevelt used about the White House. \"For almost 30 years I've done everything I could to promote the internet. I feel simultaneously privileged to have had so many opportunities to speak to so many people about the internet, but what I honestly hope, and truly believe is the case, is that people have decided for themselves. If the internet is widely accepted, it's simply the recognition of an idea whose time has come. For that you can't take credit.\" </p> <p>The IT industries are so quick to align behind winners that those not involved usually remain blissfully ignorant of the bloody battles that precede any standardisation. However, the internet's acceptance has been a long time coming, and it has been a struggle. </p> <p>Cerf nods. \"It's true, many people resisted it,\" he says. \"Its predecessor, the Arpanet, was considered a silly idea that wouldn't work, and it was ridiculed by people who grew up in the telephone tradition. Most of the computer science communities also rejected the idea of connecting up, and Arpa had to insist. </p> <p>\"When it came time to convert from the old Arpanet protocols to the new internet protocols, in January 1983, there was tremendous resistance. Finally, we had to force it on people by turning off the old protocols, so we jammed it down their throats. Then came the lengthy debate between the OSI and internet protocols, and again, that was a 10-year battle.\" </p> <p>Far from promoting the internet, most governments - including the US, the UK and the EC - adopted OSI (Open Systems Interconnect) networking in the 1980s, partly to block the advance of IBM's SNA (Systems Network Architecture). The far simpler IP, which had taken root in academe and the research community, was rarely considered, and almost always rejected for commercial use. </p> <p>The irony is that not only has IP triumphed over rival networking systems, it is also being used to carry voice traffic (Online, October 26) by the telephone companies who used to disparage it. </p> <p>\"It is a delicious irony, but we certainly didn't set out to upset the applecart,\" says Cerf. \"Looking back, we were so thoroughly rejected by the telephony community, we were left to our own resources to build our own private network, unregulated and unmanaged: we were outside their purview completely. But we could see the potential for upset, because we were experimenting with voice on the net as far back as 1975, when the backbone was only [running at] 50kbits/ sec. We used to transmit voice using a form of coding that made everyone sound like a drunken Norwegian: it was a lovely lilting sound. </p> <p>\"As far back as 1979, we were doing studies analysing which would be most cost-effective: two separate networks for voice and data, a hybrid network, or one which was all packets. Even then, the analysis said that an all-packet network, if it were big enough, would be more cost-effective. And guess what: that's what's starting to emerge!\" </p> <p>It has taken the world 20 years to catch up with Cerf, and it may be more than 20 before the interplanetary internet makes much of an impact. But if you start getting email from Martians, you'll know who to blame.</p>",

It is a credit to this government that Robin Saxby at Arm (the chip designer) and Andrew Rickman of Bookham Technology (a specialist in optic fibres) are now here.

That is what I do for a living and by doing so I make a direct impact on society. The government still has plenty of listening to do. One only has to look at the smaller end of the stock market-listed sector to see some glaring problems. Only 30% of investors in the British market are retail investors, while in Germany the figure is 60%. This no doubt has something to do with the fact that anyone who puts money into the Neuer Markt, the German market for growth companies, pays no capital gains tax. There is a lesson there. We need to think in terms of small being beautiful. It is great to have multi-billion-pound companies. It is a credit to this government that Robin Saxby at Arm (the chip designer) and Andrew Rickman of Bookham Technology (a specialist in optic fibres) are now here. Their existence encourages so many others. But creating a \u00a310m company, employing 50 people and making profits is a real achievement - for yourself and for society. It's very \"Labour\" - new or old. So let's have lots more direct measures, forming something that is probably best described as the \"glue\" of the enterprise culture. It will take time to set, maybe 10 or 15 years. There will still be the whinger asking what has this government done for small business. It should by then be safe to ignore him. \u0095 Chris Evans is a serial entrepreneur, specialising in biotechnology. Companies he has backed include Chiroscience, Celsis and Merlin Biosciences",

Once part of South Korea's second biggest conglomerate, Daewoo Motor has become a symbol of the country's stop-start efforts at corporate reform following the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98. Its failure yesterday was welcomed by foreign investors as a sign that the government is taking a tougher line against insolvent companies that were once considered too big to fail. However it threw a question mark over the future of the 750 jobs at the Daewoo technical centre in Worthing, Sussex. Union leaders yesterday called for the centre to be sold to a European company. Daewoo Motors has debts of about \u00a37bn, much of which was used to build a vast but unprofitable global empire spanning South Korea, India, Eastern Europe and India. Creditors, who have report edly been covering monthly losses of \u00a363m since the parent company collapsed last year, declared Daewoo Motor bankrupt yesterday after it defaulted on a \u00a327m loan for the second day in succession. The company's attempt to buy more time failed after union leaders rejected a new restructuring plan that would have cut a fifth of the 19,000-strong workforce. The union said its members would have to be paid \u00a370m in wages arrears before it would consider the proposals. \"We can't wait any longer.

      "bodyText": "A handful of civil servants, several hundred elderly Jewish retirees and up to 3,000 members of the US armed forces unexpectedly held the political future of the planet in their hands last night. The three groups stood in the crossfire of a succession of unprecedented political pressures yesterday as Florida began the recount that will determine whether George W Bush or Al Gore is the next president of the United States. The civil servants were the 67 county electoral supervisers responsible for carrying out the automatic recount required by Florida law when a statewide election result produces a majority of less that 0.5%. That law was triggered when Florida's final count ended in the early hours of yesterday with Mr Bush on 2,909,199 and Mr Gore on 2,907,544. The results of the recount are expected today. The Jewish retirees are among several thousand voters in Florida's blue rinse belt in Palm Beach county who say they were given misleading ballot forms to complete in Tuesday's elections in which the layout meant they accidentally voted for rightwing candidate Pat Buchanan rather than Mr Gore. Pressure was rising last night for an inquiry into the unusual ballot forms, with the Rev Jesse Jackson leading the cries of foul and mounting a public protest in nearby Miami. An unopened ballot box from an African-American church was also reportedly discovered yesterday. Meanwhile 3,000 members of the military and their spouses - thought to be mainly Republicans - are registered in Florida but cast overseas postal votes. These may not be counted until next week and could yet be the most important votes in US electoral history. The drama is powerful enough. But this story has extra human interest and an uncanny historical resonance. The human interest comes from the fact that Mr Bush's fate rests on the result in a state in which his younger brother, Jeb, who many had considered to be the more likely presidential candidate, is the governor. That means that the 67 election supervisors are employees of a bureaucracy controlled by one candidate's brother. The historical resonance derives from the fact that the man driving the accusations of foul play and demanding the recount is Mr Gore's campaign manager, William Daley.

Kennedy's behalf in a couple of gerrymandered inner city areas in 1960 were the key to Kennedy's defeat of Richard Nixon in what, until this week, was the closest US presidential election in living memory. The recount was ordered after the advantage in Florida tipped back and forth between Mr Bush and Mr Gore after the polls closed. \"As we saw the numbers coming in and we realised that there was a surplus of about 150,000 absentee ballots in our favour, we realised that it was really too early to call it,\" the Florida Republican chairman, Al Cardenas, said yesterday. For most of the early hours, the running count of votes in Florida seemed to confirm that the tide was running strongly towards Mr Bush. The Miami Herald even printed a 1am edition with the banner headline \"Bush Wins It\" which may now go down in US history as a call on a par with the Chicago Tribune's infamous \"Dewey Beats Truman\" headline in 1948. But when the votes were finally tallied, the two men were a mere 1,655 votes apart in an election in which 6m Floridians had voted. The state attorney general, Bob Butterworth, a Democrat who chairs Mr Gore's campaign in Florida, went on television to announce the mandatory recount. \"Florida has been put in a position, whether we asked for it or not, of determining who the next president of the United States is going to be,\" Mr Butterworth said in Tallahassee, the state capital. \"We owe it to the state, the country, and maybe to the world to determine that, whatever our vote might be, it's an accurate vote, it's the honest vote, and it's the vote of the people of the state of Florida.\" The Miami Herald's 4am last edition headline prudently reverted to \"Not Over Yet\". Under hastily confirmed arrangements, the Florida recount was yesterday taking place in each county in the presence of local civil service observers, judicial officials, representatives of the campaigns and the media. Clay Roberts, of the Florida division of elections, emerged late yesterday morning to say that the process would not be completed until the end of today when Jeb Bush would sign his name at the bottom of the historic validation document that could send his big brother - or his big brother's rival - to take the most important job in the world. \"The issue is not just a recount but an investigation,\" Mr Jackson told reporters in Nashville yesterday as he headed off to Miami for last night's protest. Mr Jackson said that there had been ballot irregularities in Broward, Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties. \"This does not pass the smell test,\" he said.

Really.\" </p> <p>It feels odd somehow, given how we're used to seeing him, that it's not the other way round; that he's not lambasting his people about the mix-up. And it's not the only apparent oddity. I'd braced myself to meet a wild-eyed, snarling hard man. Instead, I'm sitting with a tanned and relaxed-looking bloke with striking white teeth, dressed in a black shirt and smart grey jacket. </p> <p>When his entourage leaves the room, though, the atmosphere tenses, and it's clear this isn't going to be easy for either of us: \"It's just that I hate talking about myself,\" he admits guardedly. \"I'm always being told off for being self-deprecating.\" </p> <p>It's 11 years now since Grantham left EastEnders. Since then, he's been a jobbing character actor, playing variations on Dirty Den in a variety of middlebrow dramas. And it's the latest incarnation that we're here to talk about, a drama for Sky One called The Stretch. It's primarily notable because it reunites him with his EastEnders screen wife, Anita Dobson. </p> <p>Grantham stars as another identikit hard man doing time while Dobson, as his wife, tries to keep his criminal empire on the rails. But why are they reuniting now? \"There have been plenty of attempts to get us back together,\" he says. \"But this was a good team and it was a great script, and they got it together. And, I have to say, it was great to work with Anita again.\" </p> <p>Before the interview, I'd asked a few people what they wanted to know about Grantham. They said the same two things: what's it like to be a convicted killer (he murdered a taxi driver while doing national service in Germany in 1967, serving 11 years of a life sentence). And why has he done so little since he left the soap? </p> <p>The first question, I find impossible to ask: he's already suffered enough at the hands of the press. When The Sun uncovered his murder conviction in EastEnders' early days, he was hounded by the tabloids until he started to go round the bend. When I casually broach the subject, he's cursory about it. \"I can never change what happened in the past,\" he says. \"But when things came out, it was terrible. I just switched off.\" </p> <p>Eventually, he says, he stayed sane by making a game of it, sending decoy cars around to throw the press off the scent, leaping over the back garden wall to avoid doorstepping hacks. </p> <p>But the second question - about his post-EastEnders profile - riles him. \"Some journalist - a Guardian journalist in fact - once said the only thing I've ever done since leaving EastEnders is star in a soap advert,\" he complains. \"It's just sloppy journalism. I've had five months unemployment in 19 years but some guy says 'the only thing he's done is be in the bath'.\" </p> <p>Has Grantham changed much since he was an ex-con trying to break into the profession 20-odd years ago? \"I think I'm the same prick now as I've always been. I've just got more money,\" he says. Oh, come off it. He works. He's still famous. He's got money. \"Really, I still have something to prove like I always did. I'll never be content until I rule the world.\" But it's difficult to buy this. Take a look at any EastEnders scene from his early days, you see something in the eyes - something genuinely scary. A driven man; a guy capable of anything. Certainly not the same as the person sitting here now. </p> <p>Perhaps the most telling moment, though, is a story he tells about his drama-school days. James Cagney - his hero - was in London working on a film. Grantham went down and hung around the studio one morning until Cagney's limo showed up. \"He was being wheeled in surrounded by bouncers. I shouted at him that I wanted to be an actor and this voice came back at me: 'Acting's about walking through the door, planting your feet and telling the truth. Good luck.' I learned more from that one sentence than I did in three years at drama school.\" </p> <p>I wonder briefly what the point of the story is: did he think Cagney was passing on some kind of spiritual torch? But that doesn't make sense. Grantham doesn't seem egotistical enough to believe that. In fact it's probably just his way of reinforcing his regular guy credentials; of saying, look, I'm just an ordinary bloke really. And part of him does seem to be genuinely nonplussed at his fame. He sums it up himself: \"I get footballers, famous actors, coming up to me and wanting to talk. These are the people I adore and they're being very nice to me. And I always think: why me?\" </p> <p>After the interview, when I'm leaving, I pass him on the stairs having his picture taken.

      "body": "<p>The new Female FTSE Index, launched this week, presents a disappointing picture for talented women managers in the new millennium. The report, undertaken jointly by the Industrial Society and the Fawcett Society, and initiated by Harriet Harman, found that women account for only 5% of all directors of the FTSE-100 companies, while 45% of those organisations still have exclusively male boards.

      "bodyText": "The new Female FTSE Index, launched this week, presents a disappointing picture for talented women managers in the new millennium. The report, undertaken jointly by the Industrial Society and the Fawcett Society, and initiated by Harriet Harman, found that women account for only 5% of all directors of the FTSE-100 companies, while 45% of those organisations still have exclusively male boards. Particularly problematic is the appointment of executive, as opposed to non-executive, directors, where the index was able to find just 10 names - and only one of these, Marjorie Scardino of Pearson, is a chief executive. What are the reasons for this lack of female representation on top UK boards? Some argue that women lack the killer instinct and confidence required for boardroom life, but there is actually little evidence of great differences in the psychological make-up of male and female managers. So do women suffer from working within structures that have generally been organised by men for men, in which women have played only segregated and supporting roles? A misleading picture is often painted of the extent to which the glass ceiling has been broken and there is no large pool of women waiting to spring into executive board positions. But this is partly because women are simply not coming forward. Those in senior positions work exceptionally long hours and their commitment and dedication has to be visible and total. Women now have choices. They do not like to play such career games - and move out. Those who remain face a catch-22 situation. The key criterion for board appointments is corporate experience at board level, but how can women provide this if they cannot get that first appointment? Those who do get appointed often have other credentials, such as a title (Baroness, Dame, Lady and Dr), and a few women appear in the FTSE Female Index with remarkable frequency. Thus Dame Stella Rimington holds non-executive positions on a number of boards, including Marks &amp; Spencer and BG Group (part of British Gas), while Baronesses Hogg and Dunn appear more than once. Meanwhile, it would seem that the appointment process itself is indirectly excluding women, through the briefs given by CEOs to headhunters and the interpretation that headhunters make as to the desired \"fit\" of the new individual to the board. Despite the recent rhetoric of a move towards more informal, communicative leadership styles, at which women are said to excel, there still appears to be a \"think manager, think male\" mind-set when it comes to the appointment of directors of FTSE-100 companies. A research study, carried out by Cranfield School of Management, of European banking managers, found that women managers still see the \"successful manager\" as male, even though men are beginning to see the \"successful manager\" as androgynous, strong on both masculine and feminine leadership traits. Such a view leads women to constrain their own ambition within what they perceive to be possible, rather than pushing themselves forward for promotion.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It was scarcely surprising that the attempt - as preposterous as it was audacious - to seize the dazzling Millennium Star made news round the world. But there were few headlines when the diamond first appeared, even though its emergence into the world eight years ago was no less remarkable.</p> <p>The brightness of the diamond today contrasts with its origins in a country ruled over at the time by one of the most corrupt leaders in African history.</p> <p>The truth about exactly how the Millennium Star travelled from the diamond fields of the Democratic Republic of Congo to the cutting-rooms of Antwerp, New York and South Africa and arrived in the hands of De Beers, the biggest diamond company in the world, is shrouded in rumour and spin.</p> <p>But last night the Guardian received an extraordinary inside account of the transaction that started the jewel on its journey to the dome. It offers a rare insight into a murky and often dangerous world a million miles away from the velvet display cases of the west's jewellery stores.</p> <p>Until this week it had been shaping up as a very bad year for the industry. Diamonds have never been as emotive as they have become in recent months - the images of civilians who had suffered amputation at the hands of rebel forces in Sierra Leone and the devastation caused by the civil wars in Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo itself have aroused public concern about what have been dubbed \"blood diamonds\". Increasingly it was becoming clear to the public that jewellery prized in the west was often being paid for with lives in Africa.</p> <p>But then Tuesday's attempted heist provided the diamond industry with a wonderful public relations coup. Many papers yesterday carried a picture of the French actress, Sophie Marceau, holding the \u00a3350m diamond. The Daily Mail had it on the front, in colour. What more could the industry have asked for in the run-up to Christmas?</p> <p>Most papers carried the same potted history: that the Millennium Star had been found in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the early 1990s; that it had been bought by De Beers on the open market; and the company's specialists had spent six months studying it before beginning to make the cuts that would transform it from rough diamond to one of the most prized in the world.</p> <p>De Beers said yesterday that the information had been supplied to the press by police in London. Could it provide more information about how it had acquired the diamond? And where, exactly, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo had it been found?</p> <p>Andrew Lamont, the De Beers spokesman in London, narrowed it down: it had been found in Mbuji-Mayi in either 1991 or 1992, but it was impossible to be more specific than that. \"If you were a fisherman in Scotland and someone brought you a fish and said they caught it in the North Sea, I would have to say 'it was caught in the North Sea'. It is exactly the same.\"</p> <p>He said the diamond would have passed through lots of hands, from a Congolese digger, his boss, several other people, a travelling trader and then one of the trading stations, where a value would have been put on it. Surely, given the size of the stone, some effort would have been made to trace it back? The area was difficult, explained Lamont: it was not the kind of place that had roads and postal addresses.</p> <p>Later, Andy Bone, another De Beers spokesman, provided more details. The 770-carat rough diamond had been found in 1992 near the town and was bought from a family and community co-operative headed by a village chief. It had been purchased in open competition with other diamond buyers, and had cost millions, the most that De Beers had ever paid for a rough diamond.</p> <p>He said the village chief had not even had a cheque account and De Beers had helped to set one up.</p> <p>But last night a reliable source with close knowledge of the sale provided yet another version of the gem's provenance. According to his account, the diamond was acquired and exported perfectly legitimately.</p> <p>But the details of its first sale are compelling: \"The diamond was found by two 'pickers' who dig shallow holes. There are lots of them, living a brutal existence. They went to Mbuji-Maya, a one-horse diamond town where there are many dealers who are often black marketeers, working all sorts of deals. There are a lot of crooks there. Fortunately, they had a \"coaxier\", or negotiator with them. They didn't speak English. There were no intermediaries.\"</p> <p>The source said the pickers and their negotiator simply walked into the local De Beers office. \"The office manager must have fallen over. It was about 750 carats, a huge elongated lump with a fabulous colour. He would have given them something immediately and a price was settled at US$6m. The manager guarded it in the De Beers safe for about 10 days. It was a miracle he held onto it for so long. Word gets out there. There are people employed just to listen.\"</p> <p>The source said the fee for the diamond was handed over in cash. \"There were a lot of problems afterwards. The local president of the mine did not get a cut, it seems. The two men, I heard, were beaten up by the military.\"</p> <p>De Beers bristles at any suggestion that the Millennium Star could be a\"blood\" diamond, stressing that at the time it was found there was no civil war in Zaire (renamed the Democratic Republic of Congo four years ago).</p> <p>\"In the early 1990s, Zaire was formally recognised by the UN and had a legitimate place in the world community,\" Lamont pointed out. \"It had a place in the OAU (the Organisation of African Unity). It had a place in terms of the world political landscape. They were a legitimate government of the day.\"</p> <p>The Democratic Republic of Congo is one of the three largest diamond producers in the world and Africa's biggest with official sales of $396m. The industry, however, knows that at least as much again may be mined illegally with the real value of $500m making a mockery of the official figures.</p> <p>The town near where the diamond was found, Mbuji-Mayi, is today wracked by war and occupied by Zimbabwean soldiers, one of the many neighbours looking for a share of the diamond trade.</p> <p>Big stones are common around Mbuji-Mayi. Last month a 265.85 carat diamond, known locally as the Ngokas diamond, sold for $17.9m after being found in June in the same area as De Beers bought the Millennium Star.</p> <p>A decade ago, the town was close to ruin. Mbuji-Mayi was at the same time one of the wealthiest and yet most ramshackle towns in Zaire. Access was controlled, and all foreigners had to buy special passes from the notoriously corrupt mining ministry just to be able to fly there.</p> <p>Mbotu Sese Seko's regime had given up on maintaining public works in Mbuji-Mayi a decade or more earlier, just as it had let the rest of Zaire crumble into ruin. Roads were worn and ripped into little more than tracks, most of the town had not had electricity for years and the police and army were one vast extortion racket.</p> <p>But at night, the town was enveloped in the drone of generators lighting the homes of the diamond dealers who dealt with the poor roads by buying themselves sparkling new Mercedes four-wheel drives.</p> <p>Mbuji-Mayi's main streets were lined with the shops of Lebanese middle men all attempting to lure diamond miners to sell their gems. It is through one of these small buildings, usually with a crudely painted picture of a diamond outside for the illiterate, that De Beers claims the Millennium Star made its way to the international market and display at the dome.</p> <p>But anything as magnificent as the centrepiece of the Millennium collection would have been hard to keep secret in a town like Mbuji-Mayi, and would probably have attracted the menacing attention of Mobutu himself.</p> <p>One former De Beers employee said yesterday: \"No big diamond lasts very long. The diggers work in teams. They brag. They would have to get rid of it very fast. As soon as word got out that a big stone had been found, the local force - police, army, politician, whoever - would get it. The corruption would kick in.\"</p> <p>Around the same time that the Millennium Star was found, a story went around Kinshasa of the discovery of a large new diamond in the centre of the country and of a race between De Beers and Mobutu's cronies to lay their hands on it.</p> <p>If Mobutu's men got there first, the cost to De Beers would have risen considerably. The hapless miner who discovered the gem was said to have been caught in the middle. De Beers would pay him with money. Others tended to favour lead on such occasions.</p> <p>The miner got lucky. Mobutu's men did not get to him first, and he not only got paid but was whisked to the safety of Belgium. Lamont said yesterday he knew nothing of such a story.</p> <p>De Beers came to be a key prop maintaining Mobutu in power, along with the American and French governments. As Zaire collapsed under his maladministration, diamond revenues grew to be a more and more important source of funds with which Mobutu ensured the loyalty of just enough people - including opposition politicians and parts of the army - to stave off any serious threat to his power.</p> <p>Although De Beers argues that Mobutu was Zaire's legitimate leader, the company was at the heart of an industry that was notoriously corrupt in a country that came to epitomise graft.

      "bodyText": "It was scarcely surprising that the attempt - as preposterous as it was audacious - to seize the dazzling Millennium Star made news round the world. But there were few headlines when the diamond first appeared, even though its emergence into the world eight years ago was no less remarkable. The brightness of the diamond today contrasts with its origins in a country ruled over at the time by one of the most corrupt leaders in African history. The truth about exactly how the Millennium Star travelled from the diamond fields of the Democratic Republic of Congo to the cutting-rooms of Antwerp, New York and South Africa and arrived in the hands of De Beers, the biggest diamond company in the world, is shrouded in rumour and spin. But last night the Guardian received an extraordinary inside account of the transaction that started the jewel on its journey to the dome. It offers a rare insight into a murky and often dangerous world a million miles away from the velvet display cases of the west's jewellery stores. Until this week it had been shaping up as a very bad year for the industry. Diamonds have never been as emotive as they have become in recent months - the images of civilians who had suffered amputation at the hands of rebel forces in Sierra Leone and the devastation caused by the civil wars in Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo itself have aroused public concern about what have been dubbed \"blood diamonds\". Increasingly it was becoming clear to the public that jewellery prized in the west was often being paid for with lives in Africa. But then Tuesday's attempted heist provided the diamond industry with a wonderful public relations coup. Many papers yesterday carried a picture of the French actress, Sophie Marceau, holding the \u00a3350m diamond. The Daily Mail had it on the front, in colour. What more could the industry have asked for in the run-up to Christmas? Most papers carried the same potted history: that the Millennium Star had been found in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the early 1990s; that it had been bought by De Beers on the open market; and the company's specialists had spent six months studying it before beginning to make the cuts that would transform it from rough diamond to one of the most prized in the world. De Beers said yesterday that the information had been supplied to the press by police in London. Could it provide more information about how it had acquired the diamond? And where, exactly, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo had it been found? Andrew Lamont, the De Beers spokesman in London, narrowed it down: it had been found in Mbuji-Mayi in either 1991 or 1992, but it was impossible to be more specific than that. \"If you were a fisherman in Scotland and someone brought you a fish and said they caught it in the North Sea, I would have to say 'it was caught in the North Sea'. It is exactly the same.\" He said the diamond would have passed through lots of hands, from a Congolese digger, his boss, several other people, a travelling trader and then one of the trading stations, where a value would have been put on it. Surely, given the size of the stone, some effort would have been made to trace it back? The area was difficult, explained Lamont: it was not the kind of place that had roads and postal addresses. Later, Andy Bone, another De Beers spokesman, provided more details. The 770-carat rough diamond had been found in 1992 near the town and was bought from a family and community co-operative headed by a village chief. It had been purchased in open competition with other diamond buyers, and had cost millions, the most that De Beers had ever paid for a rough diamond. He said the village chief had not even had a cheque account and De Beers had helped to set one up. But last night a reliable source with close knowledge of the sale provided yet another version of the gem's provenance. According to his account, the diamond was acquired and exported perfectly legitimately. But the details of its first sale are compelling: \"The diamond was found by two 'pickers' who dig shallow holes. There are lots of them, living a brutal existence. They went to Mbuji-Maya, a one-horse diamond town where there are many dealers who are often black marketeers, working all sorts of deals. There are a lot of crooks there. Fortunately, they had a \"coaxier\", or negotiator with them. They didn't speak English. There were no intermediaries.\" The source said the pickers and their negotiator simply walked into the local De Beers office. \"The office manager must have fallen over. It was about 750 carats, a huge elongated lump with a fabulous colour. He would have given them something immediately and a price was settled at US$6m. The manager guarded it in the De Beers safe for about 10 days. It was a miracle he held onto it for so long. Word gets out there. There are people employed just to listen.\" The source said the fee for the diamond was handed over in cash. \"There were a lot of problems afterwards. The local president of the mine did not get a cut, it seems. The two men, I heard, were beaten up by the military.\" De Beers bristles at any suggestion that the Millennium Star could be a\"blood\" diamond, stressing that at the time it was found there was no civil war in Zaire (renamed the Democratic Republic of Congo four years ago). \"In the early 1990s, Zaire was formally recognised by the UN and had a legitimate place in the world community,\" Lamont pointed out. \"It had a place in the OAU (the Organisation of African Unity). It had a place in terms of the world political landscape. They were a legitimate government of the day.\" The Democratic Republic of Congo is one of the three largest diamond producers in the world and Africa's biggest with official sales of $396m. The industry, however, knows that at least as much again may be mined illegally with the real value of $500m making a mockery of the official figures. The town near where the diamond was found, Mbuji-Mayi, is today wracked by war and occupied by Zimbabwean soldiers, one of the many neighbours looking for a share of the diamond trade. Big stones are common around Mbuji-Mayi. Last month a 265.85 carat diamond, known locally as the Ngokas diamond, sold for $17.9m after being found in June in the same area as De Beers bought the Millennium Star. A decade ago, the town was close to ruin. Mbuji-Mayi was at the same time one of the wealthiest and yet most ramshackle towns in Zaire. Access was controlled, and all foreigners had to buy special passes from the notoriously corrupt mining ministry just to be able to fly there. Mbotu Sese Seko's regime had given up on maintaining public works in Mbuji-Mayi a decade or more earlier, just as it had let the rest of Zaire crumble into ruin. Roads were worn and ripped into little more than tracks, most of the town had not had electricity for years and the police and army were one vast extortion racket. But at night, the town was enveloped in the drone of generators lighting the homes of the diamond dealers who dealt with the poor roads by buying themselves sparkling new Mercedes four-wheel drives. Mbuji-Mayi's main streets were lined with the shops of Lebanese middle men all attempting to lure diamond miners to sell their gems. It is through one of these small buildings, usually with a crudely painted picture of a diamond outside for the illiterate, that De Beers claims the Millennium Star made its way to the international market and display at the dome. But anything as magnificent as the centrepiece of the Millennium collection would have been hard to keep secret in a town like Mbuji-Mayi, and would probably have attracted the menacing attention of Mobutu himself. One former De Beers employee said yesterday: \"No big diamond lasts very long. The diggers work in teams. They brag. They would have to get rid of it very fast. As soon as word got out that a big stone had been found, the local force - police, army, politician, whoever - would get it. The corruption would kick in.\" Around the same time that the Millennium Star was found, a story went around Kinshasa of the discovery of a large new diamond in the centre of the country and of a race between De Beers and Mobutu's cronies to lay their hands on it. If Mobutu's men got there first, the cost to De Beers would have risen considerably. The hapless miner who discovered the gem was said to have been caught in the middle. De Beers would pay him with money. Others tended to favour lead on such occasions. The miner got lucky. Mobutu's men did not get to him first, and he not only got paid but was whisked to the safety of Belgium. Lamont said yesterday he knew nothing of such a story. De Beers came to be a key prop maintaining Mobutu in power, along with the American and French governments. As Zaire collapsed under his maladministration, diamond revenues grew to be a more and more important source of funds with which Mobutu ensured the loyalty of just enough people - including opposition politicians and parts of the army - to stave off any serious threat to his power. Although De Beers argues that Mobutu was Zaire's legitimate leader, the company was at the heart of an industry that was notoriously corrupt in a country that came to epitomise graft. Much of the diamond revenue went into Mobutu's pocket, and that which did not was of little benefit to Zaire as a whole. Many would argue that diamonds did the country untold harm by perpetuating Mobutu's control until he was finally brought down by a foreign invasion. But Zaire was more than a source of mines for De Beers. It also served as cover for buying valuable gems from Unita rebels in neighbouring Angola who used the money to fund one of the longest and most brutal wars in Africa - one which is still being waged today. (De Beers has maintained it was never aware that diamonds it obtained originated from Unita.) Unita sold Angolan diamonds to Lebanese middlemen in towns such as Tshikapa. De Beers swept them up, all the time insisting it had no knowledge of their origin. But few people in Tshikapa, and certainly not the Lebanese diamond buyers, were in any doubt about where the stones came from or who was selling them. De Beers for years denied it could tell the origin of such \"blood diamonds\" and therefore it could not be accused of knowingly funding Unita. Now - with a threat to the whole international diamond trade from public concern over its role in fuelling brutal civil wars in Angola, Sierra Leone and Congo - De Beers claims exactly the opposite. It says it can identify the origin of the gems when they are compared to diamonds from the same so-called pipe, and that it can therefore certify which stones are not \"blood diamonds\". Under international pressure, led by a UK Foreign Office outraged at the way diamonds were fuelling the conflict in Sierra Leone, diamond traders met in Antwerp in July to agree to set up a certification scheme. Diamond traders, many of them previously careless about the origin of the stones they were dealing in, promised not to accept rough diamonds from those countries involved in civil war unless they had a certificate proving they were clean. This week's PR coup for the diamond industry may prove shortlived.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>There are two strangely disturbing objects on display in Tate Britain's William Blake exhibition. The first is an 18th-century \"rolling press\" of the kind Blake used to print his eye-searing, mind-boggling epic poems. </p> <p>The second is a plaster life mask of the 66-year-old visionary made in 1823 by sculptor and phrenologist James Deville. The press just happens to look like a guillotine, while the life mask could be a head severed with the geometric certainty for which this terrifying device was infamous. </p> <p>If Blake had lived at another time, such an association would be unmade and irrelevant. Blake, though, was in his prime at the time of the French Revolution, flashing guillotine blades, and what seemed to be the very real threat of French invasion. The 1790s and 1800s were a time of political and social repression in England's far from green and pleasant land. </p> <p>The governments of Pitt the younger and their spies scented sedition in the rank air of London's streets as well as in the Sussex countryside. Blake himself was arrested at Felpham and tried for allegedly insulting a soldier and damning the king. Although acquitted, he was frightened for his life. </p> <p>Blake was born in Soho in 1757 just as the industrial revolution was emerging fully armed with its dark, satanic mills from the iron heart of England. He was swept up in the savage \"No Popery\" Gordon riots of 1780 and would have seen the sad strings of boys hanging from temporary gibbets as a warning to other peacebreakers of those turbulent weeks. </p> <p>His London was a filthy, miasmic place, abounding in perverse energy and wild ideas, and this is reflected in his whirling, punky engravings. Blake was to be wrapped up in this sooty, surreptitious London nearly all his life. </p> <p>Parts of his epic Jerusalem read like a Georgian A-Z (\"The fields from Islington to Marylebone/To Primrose Hill and St John's Wood/Were builded over with pillars of gold/And there Jerusalem's pillars stood\"). London informs his poetry as surely as it did his dissenting politics and decidedly non-conformist religious views. </p> <p>And yet it was his early escapes from the Great Wen that brought angels, together with the stars and the heavens, into his dreams and art. When he was about 10 and walking across Peckham Rye, Blake saw a tree filled with angels. Another time he witnessed angelic figures walking between those of south London haymakers. </p> <p>And, as a teenager, the apprentice engraver saw Christ and his apostles among the medieval statuary he was drawing in Westminster Abbey. The Angel Gabriel came to visit him at home in Lambeth, where the Ancient of Days had once hovered above the stairwell. Blake saw, throughout his poor life, as a pre-school child does, with the mind's eye. </p> <p>To him, the world of the imagination was often more real than that of the squalid London in which he toiled, earning crusts and porter, and living with his devoted wife, Kate, in usually no more than two tiny back rooms. There was, he said, a mansion waiting for them in Heaven. </p> <p>To most of his contemporaries, Blake was a nutter or simply inept. Perhaps his most beautiful, and certainly his most spiritual, work is the set of 17 tiny woodcuts he made for Robert Thornton's edition of Virgil's Pastorals. </p> <p>Each offers a glimpse of heaven - infinity in the palm of the reader's hand - and yet the printers, when they saw Blake's blocks, thought them crude or unfinished. They were used to the buttery-smooth etched lines of, among other fine craftsmen, the highly fashionable Bartolozzi. Thornton included an apology for Blake's designs. Truly, like the Christ he adored, Blake was a prophet without honour in his own country. </p> <p>In fact, his curious poems, with the bizarre engravings that accompanied them, were not to become acceptable - outside a small circle of admirers that included his peers, the painter Fuseli, the neo-classical sculptor Flaxman, and his disciples, Samuel Palmer, John Linnel and Edward Calvert - until long after Alexander Gilchrist published the first full-length study of Blake, with a little help from the Rossetti brothers, in 1863. </p> <p>In the first edition of Gilchrist, Dante Gabriel Rossetti even fiddled with some of Blake's verse to make it more palatable to a Pre-Raphaelite readership. It wasn't until Yeats donned Blake's mystic mantle decades later (\"Myself I must remake/Till I am Timon and Lear/Or that William Blake/Who beat upon the wall/Till truth obeyed his call\" - An Acre of Grass, 1938) that Blake became a part of the modern literary canon. </p> <p>Blake's poetry, however, is inseparable from his art, and so the Tate exhibition is as much a literary as an artistic shrine. Most of Blake's writhing images of angels, demons and Old Testament characters are illustrations for the books he made so laboriously and of which very few sold. </p> <p>Had he lived 150 years longer, he would have found such images as Glad Day (1780) or The Ancient of Days (1824) stuck to the walls of a thousand student bedsits, or used on album covers, or forming the inspiration, conscious or unconscious, of dozens of illustrators. Strangest of all, he would have heard the Tory party that liked to be rid of his sort singing \"And did those feet in ancient times\" at its conferences, as though wilfully misunderstanding Blake's call to intellectual and spiritual revolution. </p> <p>The Tate show brings together no fewer than 639 works, grouped convincingly into four sections - One of the Gothic Artists, The Furnace of Lambeth's Vale, Chambers of the Imagination and Many Formidable Works. The best of these is the last. Here you can discover the intimate world of the entire 100 engraved pages - all 16 years' worth - of Blake's mighty poem Jerusalem: The Emanation of the Giant Albion. </p> <p>This vast allegory of redemption was, said Blake in a letter to his patron Thomas Butts, \"the Grandest Poem that This World Contains\". Quite what Blake meant is unclear, but then, much of his work needs to be absorbed through the eyes and ears of the soul rather than the rational mind. </p> <p>Blake was an anti-rationalist. The Ancient of Days, setting a compass upon the face of the world, also goes by the name Urizen (\"your reason\") in Blake's pseudo-Biblical language. Urizen destroys the imagination with his limiting compasses. His spirit can also be seen in that of Newton, whom Blake famously represented naked in one of his large prints finished in pen and ink and watercolour, setting his own compass, and thus what Blake calls his \"single vision\", on a sheet of paper. </p> <p>Yet, if Blake's world and beliefs are often ineffable, the images he created speak loudly to the child and to the spirit of imagination most of us are taught to put away when we go to school. Blake's demons and monsters, his funny animals and terrifying Nebuchadnezzar are the stuff that haunts the night-time bedrooms of thousands of dreamy children. </p> <p>Aside from Waterhouse's The Lady of Shalott, the reason I came to the Tate by myself as a child was to look at the Blakes - God Judging Adam from a blazing chariot of fire, The Ghost of a Flea, Nebuchadnezzar and the Virgil woodcuts. </p> <p>Blake would have made a good living today, especially in cinema or television. As it was, he was a largely marginalised creature, a kind of permanently angry teenager head-banging in his lonely room, who just about made ends meet. His mortal remains lie in an unmarked grave in the dissenters' burial ground at Bunhill Row, just north of the City of London. </p> <p>The oddity and strange beauty of his dreamy images should draw a big new audience: despite being the product of a very particular time in British history, Blake continues to speak to successive generations, to anyone who believes in the power of the imagination. He is one of Britain's greats, not just as a poet or an artist, but as a true original, a spirit of the unfettered imagination. </p> <p>Of course, this is a lousy thing to be in the material world of his or any other age, but his private world is now lavishly on display, together with a handsome catalogue, for anyone to share. This is the largest ever exhibition held on Blake, and one to get lost, and even lose your head, in. </p> <p>\u0095 William Blake is at Tate Britain, London SW1 (020-7887 8008), until February 11.</p>",

      "bodyText": "There are two strangely disturbing objects on display in Tate Britain's William Blake exhibition. The first is an 18th-century \"rolling press\" of the kind Blake used to print his eye-searing, mind-boggling epic poems. The second is a plaster life mask of the 66-year-old visionary made in 1823 by sculptor and phrenologist James Deville. The press just happens to look like a guillotine, while the life mask could be a head severed with the geometric certainty for which this terrifying device was infamous. If Blake had lived at another time, such an association would be unmade and irrelevant. Blake, though, was in his prime at the time of the French Revolution, flashing guillotine blades, and what seemed to be the very real threat of French invasion. The 1790s and 1800s were a time of political and social repression in England's far from green and pleasant land. The governments of Pitt the younger and their spies scented sedition in the rank air of London's streets as well as in the Sussex countryside. Blake himself was arrested at Felpham and tried for allegedly insulting a soldier and damning the king. Although acquitted, he was frightened for his life. Blake was born in Soho in 1757 just as the industrial revolution was emerging fully armed with its dark, satanic mills from the iron heart of England. He was swept up in the savage \"No Popery\" Gordon riots of 1780 and would have seen the sad strings of boys hanging from temporary gibbets as a warning to other peacebreakers of those turbulent weeks. His London was a filthy, miasmic place, abounding in perverse energy and wild ideas, and this is reflected in his whirling, punky engravings. Blake was to be wrapped up in this sooty, surreptitious London nearly all his life. Parts of his epic Jerusalem read like a Georgian A-Z (\"The fields from Islington to Marylebone/To Primrose Hill and St John's Wood/Were builded over with pillars of gold/And there Jerusalem's pillars stood\"). London informs his poetry as surely as it did his dissenting politics and decidedly non-conformist religious views. And yet it was his early escapes from the Great Wen that brought angels, together with the stars and the heavens, into his dreams and art. When he was about 10 and walking across Peckham Rye, Blake saw a tree filled with angels. Another time he witnessed angelic figures walking between those of south London haymakers. And, as a teenager, the apprentice engraver saw Christ and his apostles among the medieval statuary he was drawing in Westminster Abbey. The Angel Gabriel came to visit him at home in Lambeth, where the Ancient of Days had once hovered above the stairwell. Blake saw, throughout his poor life, as a pre-school child does, with the mind's eye. To him, the world of the imagination was often more real than that of the squalid London in which he toiled, earning crusts and porter, and living with his devoted wife, Kate, in usually no more than two tiny back rooms. There was, he said, a mansion waiting for them in Heaven. To most of his contemporaries, Blake was a nutter or simply inept. Perhaps his most beautiful, and certainly his most spiritual, work is the set of 17 tiny woodcuts he made for Robert Thornton's edition of Virgil's Pastorals. Each offers a glimpse of heaven - infinity in the palm of the reader's hand - and yet the printers, when they saw Blake's blocks, thought them crude or unfinished. They were used to the buttery-smooth etched lines of, among other fine craftsmen, the highly fashionable Bartolozzi. Thornton included an apology for Blake's designs. Truly, like the Christ he adored, Blake was a prophet without honour in his own country. In fact, his curious poems, with the bizarre engravings that accompanied them, were not to become acceptable - outside a small circle of admirers that included his peers, the painter Fuseli, the neo-classical sculptor Flaxman, and his disciples, Samuel Palmer, John Linnel and Edward Calvert - until long after Alexander Gilchrist published the first full-length study of Blake, with a little help from the Rossetti brothers, in 1863. In the first edition of Gilchrist, Dante Gabriel Rossetti even fiddled with some of Blake's verse to make it more palatable to a Pre-Raphaelite readership. It wasn't until Yeats donned Blake's mystic mantle decades later (\"Myself I must remake/Till I am Timon and Lear/Or that William Blake/Who beat upon the wall/Till truth obeyed his call\" - An Acre of Grass, 1938) that Blake became a part of the modern literary canon. Blake's poetry, however, is inseparable from his art, and so the Tate exhibition is as much a literary as an artistic shrine. Most of Blake's writhing images of angels, demons and Old Testament characters are illustrations for the books he made so laboriously and of which very few sold. Had he lived 150 years longer, he would have found such images as Glad Day (1780) or The Ancient of Days (1824) stuck to the walls of a thousand student bedsits, or used on album covers, or forming the inspiration, conscious or unconscious, of dozens of illustrators. Strangest of all, he would have heard the Tory party that liked to be rid of his sort singing \"And did those feet in ancient times\" at its conferences, as though wilfully misunderstanding Blake's call to intellectual and spiritual revolution. The Tate show brings together no fewer than 639 works, grouped convincingly into four sections - One of the Gothic Artists, The Furnace of Lambeth's Vale, Chambers of the Imagination and Many Formidable Works. The best of these is the last. Here you can discover the intimate world of the entire 100 engraved pages - all 16 years' worth - of Blake's mighty poem Jerusalem: The Emanation of the Giant Albion. This vast allegory of redemption was, said Blake in a letter to his patron Thomas Butts, \"the Grandest Poem that This World Contains\". Quite what Blake meant is unclear, but then, much of his work needs to be absorbed through the eyes and ears of the soul rather than the rational mind. Blake was an anti-rationalist. The Ancient of Days, setting a compass upon the face of the world, also goes by the name Urizen (\"your reason\") in Blake's pseudo-Biblical language. Urizen destroys the imagination with his limiting compasses. His spirit can also be seen in that of Newton, whom Blake famously represented naked in one of his large prints finished in pen and ink and watercolour, setting his own compass, and thus what Blake calls his \"single vision\", on a sheet of paper. Yet, if Blake's world and beliefs are often ineffable, the images he created speak loudly to the child and to the spirit of imagination most of us are taught to put away when we go to school. Blake's demons and monsters, his funny animals and terrifying Nebuchadnezzar are the stuff that haunts the night-time bedrooms of thousands of dreamy children. Aside from Waterhouse's The Lady of Shalott, the reason I came to the Tate by myself as a child was to look at the Blakes - God Judging Adam from a blazing chariot of fire, The Ghost of a Flea, Nebuchadnezzar and the Virgil woodcuts. Blake would have made a good living today, especially in cinema or television. As it was, he was a largely marginalised creature, a kind of permanently angry teenager head-banging in his lonely room, who just about made ends meet. His mortal remains lie in an unmarked grave in the dissenters' burial ground at Bunhill Row, just north of the City of London. The oddity and strange beauty of his dreamy images should draw a big new audience: despite being the product of a very particular time in British history, Blake continues to speak to successive generations, to anyone who believes in the power of the imagination. He is one of Britain's greats, not just as a poet or an artist, but as a true original, a spirit of the unfettered imagination. Of course, this is a lousy thing to be in the material world of his or any other age, but his private world is now lavishly on display, together with a handsome catalogue, for anyone to share. This is the largest ever exhibition held on Blake, and one to get lost, and even lose your head, in. \u0095 William Blake is at Tate Britain, London SW1 (020-7887 8008), until February 11.",

An inquiry by a high court judge into the shipwreck, which claimed the lives of the 42 crew and the wives of two of them, rejected the findings of an earlier investigation which blamed the sinking off the Japanese coast on a failure to secure a hatch cover properly. Instead Mr Justice Colman blamed the disaster on inadequate hatch covers, which bent and buckled when the vessel encountered 80ft waves in a Pacific ocean typhoon in September 1980. Sea water poured into the space above the cargo, causing the vessel to plunge deeper, increasing the pressure on other hatch covers, which burst, and leading to the huge ship's sink ing two-and-a-half miles to the bottom. The deputy prime minister, John Prescott, said he fully endorsed the view that the crew were in no way to blame for the loss \"and his specific rejection of the suggestion that the bosun's stores hatch was left unsecured by the crew\".

      "body": "<p>It could have been a scene from Jaws. A group of middle-aged swimmers was taking a regular early-morning dip on an eerily overcast Monday at North Cottesloe beach. Around 100 people were milling about, watching the gentle surf roll in and sipping cafe lattes in Perth's fashionable beachside bars.</p> <p>\"Is there something out there?\" Ken Crew asked his friends as he ploughed along in the quiet of the shallows. A second later, in waist-deep water, his leg was torn off by a 16ft great white shark.</p> <p>People screamed as the surf boiled red. His friend, Dirk Avery, tried to beat the shark back, but was bitten badly on his legs and feet. Crew was dragged to the shore, but life-savers could only look on helplessly: the 49-year-old father of three had lost too much blood and died on the sand.</p> <p>The fatal attack was the third off the coast of Australia recently. Last month, a fisherman swam four hours to safety after a great white shark sank his small boat. He survived. Six weeks ago, two south coast-surfers - a honeymooner and a 15-year-old - didn't make it home. They were hauled off their boards on successive days by great whites.</p> <p>For two days after the latest attack, Perth's normally bustling city beaches were empty, closed to the public. Many Australians were left wondering if their beachside lifestyle, of weekends spent picnicking, swimming, surfing and diving off their country's golden sands, was worth the risk.</p> <p>But there is life in the Australian dream yet. Stephen Leahy, the national lifesaving services manager of Surf Life Saving Australia, reports \"business as usual\" around the country's coastline.</p> <p>Down at the cherished symbol of Australia's good life, Sydney's Bondi beach, the usual bobbing crowd, resembling a school of dolphins in their dark, sleek wetsuits, lines up in the sunshine, 150 yards from the shore, to ride its famous waves. \"It's something everyone worries about, but at the end of the day if you want to surf, sharks might always be there,\" says surfer Luca Ciano, 22, clambering out of the ocean with his board.</p> <p>Lancashire backpacker Martin Smith, 24, has just taken his first plunge in Australian waters. \"I asked the lifeguards where it was safe to surf first, but I'm not worried about sharks.

      "bodyText": "It could have been a scene from Jaws. A group of middle-aged swimmers was taking a regular early-morning dip on an eerily overcast Monday at North Cottesloe beach. Around 100 people were milling about, watching the gentle surf roll in and sipping cafe lattes in Perth's fashionable beachside bars. \"Is there something out there?\" Ken Crew asked his friends as he ploughed along in the quiet of the shallows. A second later, in waist-deep water, his leg was torn off by a 16ft great white shark. People screamed as the surf boiled red. His friend, Dirk Avery, tried to beat the shark back, but was bitten badly on his legs and feet. Crew was dragged to the shore, but life-savers could only look on helplessly: the 49-year-old father of three had lost too much blood and died on the sand. The fatal attack was the third off the coast of Australia recently. Last month, a fisherman swam four hours to safety after a great white shark sank his small boat. He survived. Six weeks ago, two south coast-surfers - a honeymooner and a 15-year-old - didn't make it home. They were hauled off their boards on successive days by great whites. For two days after the latest attack, Perth's normally bustling city beaches were empty, closed to the public. Many Australians were left wondering if their beachside lifestyle, of weekends spent picnicking, swimming, surfing and diving off their country's golden sands, was worth the risk. But there is life in the Australian dream yet. Stephen Leahy, the national lifesaving services manager of Surf Life Saving Australia, reports \"business as usual\" around the country's coastline. Down at the cherished symbol of Australia's good life, Sydney's Bondi beach, the usual bobbing crowd, resembling a school of dolphins in their dark, sleek wetsuits, lines up in the sunshine, 150 yards from the shore, to ride its famous waves. \"It's something everyone worries about, but at the end of the day if you want to surf, sharks might always be there,\" says surfer Luca Ciano, 22, clambering out of the ocean with his board. Lancashire backpacker Martin Smith, 24, has just taken his first plunge in Australian waters. \"I asked the lifeguards where it was safe to surf first, but I'm not worried about sharks. I've been more concerned about the jellyfish.\" He is visiting Perth on his travels. Will he swim there? \"Probably. I can't see why not,\" he laughs. The sun has smelted deep creases onto the face of Bondi regular Gary Taylor. He has been swimming at the beach for \"62 years, maybe longer\" and he has only crossed the path of a shark once. \"We don't have shark attacks,\" Taylor barks. \"You've got more chance of being hit by a bloody car as you walk across the promenade.\" But he says he wouldn't swim \"down south\" or over at Perth. Most of Australia's popular beaches have shark nets, but these are not completely shark-proof. \"A shark can swim in it or around it or over it,\" says Taylor, who saw two sharks being pulled from Bondi's nets last year. Australia's lifeguards also offer protection, scanning the horizon for sharks and sounding sirens if a suspicious fin is sighted. \"If a shark alarm is sounded this weekend somewhere, people will take more heed of it than they habitually do,\" predicts lifesaver Stephen Leahy.

      "body": "<p>My home page took five years to publish. That's not an idle boast, and don't think for a second that if you pop over to it you'll find anything that justifies such a long gestation. It's not even really working properly yet. </p> <p>Worse, it is said that every year on the web is worth seven in the \"real\" world, which makes the wait around 35 web years. And that does one's already tatty web-savvy, working-at-the-speed-of-the-net credentials no good at all. </p> <p>What's the problem been? Apart from a near fatal dose of procrastination, and laziness, there have been the shifting sands of web page fashion. </p> <p>Back in 1995, when I first started out on this foolhardy project, the web was already established and growing at a frightening pace. New tricks, bells and whistles seemed to appear almost daily. </p> <p>During long winter evenings, my little website, isolated on my Mac's hard drive, grew, mutated and shrank in the face of these fashions. It sprouted - and shed - bright coloured backgrounds, giant graphics, animated gifs flashing and winking all over the place, frames dividing and sub dividing the screen, fancy Javascript routines that ... well, they just crashed your computer. </p> <p>But every time I would sit back and say: that looks bloody awful. Everything I created looked as bad as the first examples of desktop-published parish magazines that appeared 15 years ago, which blended an orgy of bad clip-art with an ugly rash of typefaces. </p> <p>If only someone had uttered the magic words - \"keep it simple, stupid\" a bit earlier. </p> <p>There are lots of disciples to the \"keep it simple\" gospel, but the one true prophet is Jakob Nielsen, the web design guru who charges astronomical fees to companies wanting to hear his straightforward message. You can find his words of wisdom at <a href=\"http://www.useit.org\">www.useit.org</a>, and it was these pages (remarkably un-designed, funnily enough) that were my road to a virtual Damascus. </p> <p>Out went nearly all of the fancy stuff. Instead of futile attempts to look clever by using all the tricks of this dubious trade, I decided to go for simplicity. And that extended to much more than the design. </p> <p> <strong> The right package</strong> <br> I'd been intending, for instance, to learn HTML to a standard which would allow me to build the way-cool website I had in my mind's eye. I bought the books, I printed out the websites. I swallowed all the techy propaganda which states that the only way you will ever build a proper website is to learn the programming languages which run it. </p> <p>This simply ain't so. It might once have been useful to know HTML, a bit in the same way that it was probably once useful for car drivers to understand how their cars worked. </p> <p>And, to be fair, it's still worth looking into the HTML of pages just to see how they are structured, a bit like it's a good idea to know where the bonnet release lever is on your Ford. </p> <p>But, in the same way most of us would pop down to our local garage to buy a car ready built, rather than order the parts ourselves, knowing the language inside out simply doesn't make sense, unless you plan to make this your career. </p> <p>Instead, I bought a web design package. There are lots of these about for Macs and PCs - two years ago I opted for what was, then, called Golive Cyberstudio Personal Edition, which cost \u00a3100. </p> <p>Nowadays, it's called Adobe Golive 5.0 and has doubled in price. But cheaper alternatives - such as Microsoft's Frontpage 2000 (\u00a3130) - exist, and do the job well. </p> <p>The job of these packages is to make building web pages almost as easy as putting together magazine pages in a desktop publishing program. They allow you to drag and drop elements for the page - images, text and the rest - anywhere you want, with all the difficult coding bit being done by the program in the background. The software will even help you organise your site, and put all the resources you need in the right places. </p> <p>Having taken delivery of your page make-up program, it's a good idea to take a little time to mess around with it, putting together sample pages and testing what they look like in various browsers by loading them up from your hard drive (just go to the file menu in Explorer or Navigator and choose \"open file\" to look at files on your hard drive). </p> <p>Browser compatibility remains a sticky part of web weaving, no matter how you design your page - different browsers handle pages in different ways. That's not helped by using a design package, rather than typing in raw HTML, as machine-generated code is often not as efficient as the best human programmer's. </p> <p>But with a little experimentation, you should find that you can get your pages looking acceptable in the major browsers. Microsoft's Internet Explorer is the dominant browser, according to web research from Websidestory, with 86% of the market, followed by Netscape's Navigator with 13.9%, so these are the ones which really matter. </p> <p>It is surprisingly easy to lock users out of your site. Already, some parts of my pages simply do not work on older browsers, and I've hit the need for a compromise between functionality and compatibility, which has floored many a dot.com. </p> <p>As a rule of thumb, the more complex a site, the less compatible it is likely to be. If you want to include lots of tricks and compatibility is important to you, consider producing a plain vanilla, text-only version as well. </p> <p> <strong> First: Stop!</strong> <br> Having experimented a little, the best thing you can do next is move away from your computer and sit down and plan your site. You'll need to decide on a few things before you get going, or life will be much more difficult later on. </p> <p>First, what are you going to put on your site? It's easy to be far too ambitious at first, so try and err on the side of caution - it's demoralising if you make plans you subsequently can't follow. Obviously, you'll start with the home page itself, but it makes sense to divide the rest of your content up so that the first page is not too big (you should be able to hold your breath, without blacking out, for the time it takes for a page to download using a standard 56k modem). Create submenus for, say, family snaps, a page of links, an online diary or your personal details. You could then use your front page simply to say what's new on your site, or point to the most important bits. </p> <p>Second, bear in mind that you don't want your site to go too deep. This means users should not have to click on more than two or three links to see anything on your site: users tire of sites which force them to burrow too deep. </p> <p>Third, decide what your site's name is going to be. With domain names now so cheap, it's easy to buy your own domain name, which will make your site easier for people to find, and give you a cooler email address too. </p> <p>I bought my domain name from <a href=\"http://www.getdotted.com\">Get Dotted</a> for around \u00a330, and the company also threw in unlimited web space and forwarding through the Freeola ISP. </p> <p>Freeola's web servers might not be the fastest, but otherwise the service is excellent (with useful step-by-step instructions for uploading pages), and there are plenty of other low-cost domain name registrars who offer great value, low cost deals, too. </p> <p>Costs and value for money can vary wildly: I bought an address as a present from NetNames, a London registrar, and it cost more than \u00a3100. Yet, despite the premium price, NetNames took days, several phone calls, and a flurry of angry emails to get the address \"pointing\" at the right website. Even they beat Demon Internet, who didn't return my calls . </p> <p>Finally, with your new name in mind, think up a template for your page design which will be used for all, or at least the majority, of your pages. Doing this before you start gives you a number of advantages. Your site will look much more slick and download faster if the pages use the same basic graphics and layout, and the process of creating the site will be made much faster by having ready made pages to use. A typical template page will have your site's logo or name, and links to the main sub-menus at the top (and bottom, perhaps), so that users always know where to go to navigate around. </p> <p>Once you've made your template, insert a picture and some random text, and try uploading it (your ISP or webspace provider should give instructions on what you need to do. Your web building software's manual will tell you how to do it). By putting it on the web, you can get some practice in the sometimes fiddly process of uploading, and you also get to test the design on other machines. </p> <p> <strong> Getting on with it</strong> <br> After all this planning comes the most important bit: producing the pages. And here, alas, there's no hi-tech substitute for a large pot of coffee, a free weekend and a bit of hard work. </p> <p>Try to keep to your plans, and avoid being distracted by the temptation to insert any fancy gimmicks. If, like me, you've looked around the web for tips on designing web pages, you will have found lots of bits of code you can paste in to do fancy tricks: avoid them. One disadvantage of not knowing HTML is that pasting these into the computer-generated code that your web editing software has written can be very tricky. It can be very demoralising to upload everything for the first time to find that a hit counter inserted on every page, for instance, has messed up the whole thing. You can always experiment later when you want to update the site. </p> <p>Which brings us back to the last important point: updating. The web changes all the time, yet so many sites - personal and corporate - are created then forgotten. </p> <p>Nobody expects a home page to update every hour, or even every day. But it doesn't matter if your audience is the world, or just your mates: if it's clear you haven't done anything in months, everyone will stop bothering to look. </p> <p>And after all your planning and effort, that would be a shame, wouldn't it? </p> <p><strong> Can you cheat?</strong><br> Does all this look like like a little too much effort? Many websites now help you build your pages online, making the process even simpler. The best known include <a href=\"http://angelfire.lycos.com\" target=\"_new\">Angelfire</a> and <a href=\"http://www.homestead.com\" target=\"_new\">Homestead</a> at, but even the likes of Handbag, the UK women's portal, is getting in on the act at <a href=\"http://www.handbag.com\">www.handbag.com</a>. </p> <p>You put together the pages through your web browser, using a series of templates and forms and uploading pictures from your hard disk. Most of the services have additional features which you can add to your pages, from animated graphics, through scripts and games - even digital video. </p> <p>There are downsides. Some people would argue that if you use these services to their fullest extent, it could be simpler to buy a web design program. Others would argue that these services encourage you to build over-complex, gimmick-laden pages, while restricting those people who have a specific idea of how their pages should turn out. And, of course, it could be easy to run up a big phone bill as you build the site online, unless you have one of the new \"always on\" broadband connections. </p> <p>But these sites and their ever-popular gimmicks are growing in popularity, and the services are becoming more and more sophisticated and flexible. </p> <p>The only downside is that banner adverts may pop up as people browse your site - that's how they make their money. But, for millions, that's a price worth paying. </p> <p><strong> Born of frustration: 10 tips from five years</strong> </p> <p> <strong>1 </strong> Consider buying a web design package </p> <p> <strong>2 </strong> Plan your site carefully </p> <p> <strong>3 </strong> Don't be too ambitious </p> <p> <strong>4 </strong> Always think of the user </p> <p> <strong>5 </strong> Avoid graphical gimmicks </p> <p> <strong>6 </strong> Build a template </p> <p> <strong>7 </strong> Keep your site's design as consistent as you can </p> <p> <strong>8 </strong> Shop around for domain names and web space </p> <p> <strong>9 </strong> Make sure pages don't take too long to download </p> <p> <strong>10 </strong> Set a deadline for finishing your site... </p> <p> \u0095 Neil McIntosh's site is at <a href=\"http://www.neilmc.net  \">www.neilmc.net</a></p>",

That's not helped by using a design package, rather than typing in raw HTML, as machine-generated code is often not as efficient as the best human programmer's. But with a little experimentation, you should find that you can get your pages looking acceptable in the major browsers. Microsoft's Internet Explorer is the dominant browser, according to web research from Websidestory, with 86% of the market, followed by Netscape's Navigator with 13.9%, so these are the ones which really matter. It is surprisingly easy to lock users out of your site. Already, some parts of my pages simply do not work on older browsers, and I've hit the need for a compromise between functionality and compatibility, which has floored many a dot.com. As a rule of thumb, the more complex a site, the less compatible it is likely to be. If you want to include lots of tricks and compatibility is important to you, consider producing a plain vanilla, text-only version as well. First: Stop! Having experimented a little, the best thing you can do next is move away from your computer and sit down and plan your site. You'll need to decide on a few things before you get going, or life will be much more difficult later on. First, what are you going to put on your site? It's easy to be far too ambitious at first, so try and err on the side of caution - it's demoralising if you make plans you subsequently can't follow. Obviously, you'll start with the home page itself, but it makes sense to divide the rest of your content up so that the first page is not too big (you should be able to hold your breath, without blacking out, for the time it takes for a page to download using a standard 56k modem). Create submenus for, say, family snaps, a page of links, an online diary or your personal details. You could then use your front page simply to say what's new on your site, or point to the most important bits. Second, bear in mind that you don't want your site to go too deep. This means users should not have to click on more than two or three links to see anything on your site: users tire of sites which force them to burrow too deep. Third, decide what your site's name is going to be. With domain names now so cheap, it's easy to buy your own domain name, which will make your site easier for people to find, and give you a cooler email address too. I bought my domain name from Get Dotted for around \u00a330, and the company also threw in unlimited web space and forwarding through the Freeola ISP. Freeola's web servers might not be the fastest, but otherwise the service is excellent (with useful step-by-step instructions for uploading pages), and there are plenty of other low-cost domain name registrars who offer great value, low cost deals, too. Costs and value for money can vary wildly: I bought an address as a present from NetNames, a London registrar, and it cost more than \u00a3100. Yet, despite the premium price, NetNames took days, several phone calls, and a flurry of angry emails to get the address \"pointing\" at the right website. Even they beat Demon Internet, who didn't return my calls . Finally, with your new name in mind, think up a template for your page design which will be used for all, or at least the majority, of your pages. Doing this before you start gives you a number of advantages. Your site will look much more slick and download faster if the pages use the same basic graphics and layout, and the process of creating the site will be made much faster by having ready made pages to use. A typical template page will have your site's logo or name, and links to the main sub-menus at the top (and bottom, perhaps), so that users always know where to go to navigate around. Once you've made your template, insert a picture and some random text, and try uploading it (your ISP or webspace provider should give instructions on what you need to do. Your web building software's manual will tell you how to do it). By putting it on the web, you can get some practice in the sometimes fiddly process of uploading, and you also get to test the design on other machines. Getting on with it After all this planning comes the most important bit: producing the pages. And here, alas, there's no hi-tech substitute for a large pot of coffee, a free weekend and a bit of hard work. Try to keep to your plans, and avoid being distracted by the temptation to insert any fancy gimmicks. If, like me, you've looked around the web for tips on designing web pages, you will have found lots of bits of code you can paste in to do fancy tricks: avoid them. One disadvantage of not knowing HTML is that pasting these into the computer-generated code that your web editing software has written can be very tricky. It can be very demoralising to upload everything for the first time to find that a hit counter inserted on every page, for instance, has messed up the whole thing. You can always experiment later when you want to update the site. Which brings us back to the last important point: updating. The web changes all the time, yet so many sites - personal and corporate - are created then forgotten. Nobody expects a home page to update every hour, or even every day. But it doesn't matter if your audience is the world, or just your mates: if it's clear you haven't done anything in months, everyone will stop bothering to look. And after all your planning and effort, that would be a shame, wouldn't it? Can you cheat? Does all this look like like a little too much effort? Many websites now help you build your pages online, making the process even simpler. The best known include Angelfire and Homestead at, but even the likes of Handbag, the UK women's portal, is getting in on the act at www.handbag.com. You put together the pages through your web browser, using a series of templates and forms and uploading pictures from your hard disk. Most of the services have additional features which you can add to your pages, from animated graphics, through scripts and games - even digital video. There are downsides. Some people would argue that if you use these services to their fullest extent, it could be simpler to buy a web design program. Others would argue that these services encourage you to build over-complex, gimmick-laden pages, while restricting those people who have a specific idea of how their pages should turn out. And, of course, it could be easy to run up a big phone bill as you build the site online, unless you have one of the new \"always on\" broadband connections. But these sites and their ever-popular gimmicks are growing in popularity, and the services are becoming more and more sophisticated and flexible. The only downside is that banner adverts may pop up as people browse your site - that's how they make their money. But, for millions, that's a price worth paying. Born of frustration: 10 tips from five years 1 Consider buying a web design package 2 Plan your site carefully 3 Don't be too ambitious 4 Always think of the user 5 Avoid graphical gimmicks 6 Build a template 7 Keep your site's design as consistent as you can 8 Shop around for domain names and web space 9 Make sure pages don't take too long to download 10 Set a deadline for finishing your site... \u0095 Neil McIntosh's site is at www.neilmc.net",

Now, based in Barcelona, he has founded <a href=\"http://www.LeatherXchange.com\" target=\"_new\">LeatherXchange.com</a> which he hopes will become the leading B2B (business to business) marketplace for the global leather industry. </p> <p>The exchange has about 500 member companies and lets buyers and sellers trade online in raw and semi-processed hides and skins. Claiming to be receiving about 60 requests for quotes a month, Suarez's exchange has been held back by the fact that customers cannot physically see the animal hides they are ordering. </p> <p>So next January it will launch an inspection service. There will be four inspectors operating out of Barcelona and Kiev and three out of Moscow who, based on agreed online specifications, will travel across Europe to physically inspect orders of pig, sheep and cattle skins before they are shipped to the exchange's customers. </p> <p>Suarez says: \"The internet is a great communications channel but in itself a virtual marketplace is not going to work. You find someone online and all you have are some cold forms. You need to set up with people who are able to augment the information which exists on the cold forms.\" </p> <p>The task of guaranteeing and delivering on virtual handshakes is one of the biggest headaches afflicting ambitious founders of B2B exchanges across Europe. It is a huge market. Recently Forrester Research announced that transactions on B2B exchanges in Europe are set to rise to \u00a3534bn by 2005. </p> <p>Evangelists for this pioneering way of trading are talking about buyers being able to make better-informed purchasing decisions and they say suppliers will have a cheaper sales channel which will be invaluable in fragmented markets. While few people doubt the potential of the internet to transform B2B transactions, the reality is that the industry is struggling to successfully meet very high expectations. </p> <p>\"I think right now it's all hype,\" says Gartner Group's research director, Petra Gartzen. \"In terms of actual transactions going through marketplaces in Europe, there is little going on. It's really minute.\" </p> <p> The low level of activity can be explained by the fact that the industry is still very much in its infancy but Gartzen argues that a lot of new B2B exchanges are shooting themselves in the foot by being too buyer-biased and suppliers fear they are losing control of the pricing of their products and services. \"The marketplaces need to be focusing on how they can help suppliers maintain their brand in an internet world. They do not have a proper understanding of how to put a value proposition to a supplier,\" she says, adding that too often exchanges rank suppliers simply on price and do not promote other factors such as quality of service. </p> <p>Rouzbeh Pirouz, chief executive of Mondus.co.uk, which runs e-marketplaces for IT and office services across Europe and in the US, believes online exchanges do offer benefits to buyers and suppliers. \"It's a very easy and targeted way to meetcustomers. Just having a shop front on the internet is not enough to pull in the customers.\" </p> <p>Mondus, with 175,000 registered users, recently organised roadshows with the British Chamber of Commerce to promote online B2B transactions.

      "bodyText": "Jose Suarez used to run a Moscow-based trading company which exported leather hides around the world. Now, based in Barcelona, he has founded LeatherXchange.com which he hopes will become the leading B2B (business to business) marketplace for the global leather industry. The exchange has about 500 member companies and lets buyers and sellers trade online in raw and semi-processed hides and skins. Claiming to be receiving about 60 requests for quotes a month, Suarez's exchange has been held back by the fact that customers cannot physically see the animal hides they are ordering. So next January it will launch an inspection service. There will be four inspectors operating out of Barcelona and Kiev and three out of Moscow who, based on agreed online specifications, will travel across Europe to physically inspect orders of pig, sheep and cattle skins before they are shipped to the exchange's customers. Suarez says: \"The internet is a great communications channel but in itself a virtual marketplace is not going to work. You find someone online and all you have are some cold forms. You need to set up with people who are able to augment the information which exists on the cold forms.\" The task of guaranteeing and delivering on virtual handshakes is one of the biggest headaches afflicting ambitious founders of B2B exchanges across Europe. It is a huge market. Recently Forrester Research announced that transactions on B2B exchanges in Europe are set to rise to \u00a3534bn by 2005. Evangelists for this pioneering way of trading are talking about buyers being able to make better-informed purchasing decisions and they say suppliers will have a cheaper sales channel which will be invaluable in fragmented markets. While few people doubt the potential of the internet to transform B2B transactions, the reality is that the industry is struggling to successfully meet very high expectations. \"I think right now it's all hype,\" says Gartner Group's research director, Petra Gartzen. \"In terms of actual transactions going through marketplaces in Europe, there is little going on. It's really minute.\" The low level of activity can be explained by the fact that the industry is still very much in its infancy but Gartzen argues that a lot of new B2B exchanges are shooting themselves in the foot by being too buyer-biased and suppliers fear they are losing control of the pricing of their products and services. \"The marketplaces need to be focusing on how they can help suppliers maintain their brand in an internet world. They do not have a proper understanding of how to put a value proposition to a supplier,\" she says, adding that too often exchanges rank suppliers simply on price and do not promote other factors such as quality of service. Rouzbeh Pirouz, chief executive of Mondus.co.uk, which runs e-marketplaces for IT and office services across Europe and in the US, believes online exchanges do offer benefits to buyers and suppliers. \"It's a very easy and targeted way to meetcustomers. Just having a shop front on the internet is not enough to pull in the customers.\" Mondus, with 175,000 registered users, recently organised roadshows with the British Chamber of Commerce to promote online B2B transactions. Pirouz will not reveal the actual number of transactions carried out through Mondus but he says he is confident about the state of the market. \"I think a lot of transactions are occurring. Obviously the challenge that B2B marketplaces have is to track and account for as many transactions as possible. A lot of transactions do occur through the contacts that are made.\" He adds that an independent third party assessment of Mondus recently found that about 12% of the relationships established through Mondus had resulted in transactions online and offline. Many exchanges have online feedback mechanisms which are usually geared to buyers reporting on experiences they have had with particular suppliers. Pirouz points out that feedback does not generally focus solely on pricing. Ratings can cover anything from customer service through to delivery times, and buyers can use these online tools to build long term relationships with new suppliers. All pan-European exchanges know their virtual marketplaces have to be trusted if they are to succeed and they are exploring ways to instil greater trust in potential buyers and suppliers. Intelligo.cz, a new Prague-based B2B e-marketplace for office products in central and eastern Europe is insisting that all customers of its new exchange sign contracts covering the quality of product information they offer.

Chief executive Dalibor Wijas says that anyone in breach of their contract will be banned from the exchange. Using credit checks is another way of building trust in an e-marketplace.

      "body": "<p>Sony's latest Vaio is the first notebook PC with a power-saving Transmeta processor to be sold in the UK, with the promise of a dramatic improvement in battery life. The PCG-C1VE also has several innovations not usually found in Windows PCs: a built-in Motion Eye camera, a Sony Jog Dial, and a slot for Sony Memory Sticks. However, I suspect most people would find it more attractive if only it were a bit more ordinary. </p> <p>But the main attraction is Transmeta's Crusoe chip - presumably named after Robinson Crusoe. This wholly new design that uses \"code morphing\" to provide compatibility with Intel Pentium-style processors. In other words, it translates the x86 instructions intended for Intel chips into Transmeta instructions before running them. This allows a low-power Crusoe to replace an Intel chip, extending the computer's battery life. It also means no cooling fan is needed. </p> <p>Other manufacturers are also using the chip, and both Sony and Compaq are Transmeta shareholders. However, after experimenting with ThinkPad 240 subnotebooks using Crusoe chips, IBM has decided not to go ahead at the moment. This shook the market just before Transmeta's public share offering on Monday, because IBM is making Crusoe chips on Transmeta's behalf. </p> <p>Transmeta's approach has drawbacks, too, to judge by Sony's implementation. First, the C1VE sometimes seems very slow, particularly when starting new programs. Transmeta says the chip runs at 600MHz and, to save power, 300MHz, but it does not feel as fast as a 300MHz Intel Celeron. </p> <p>Second, you lose 16 megabytes of memory, which the Crusoe uses to optimise and store its translations. This means performance improves while you use a program, but you have only 112MB of usable memory, not 128MB. </p> <p>As for battery life, the previous version of this Sony Vaio, the PCG-C1, was a bit of a disaster: the battery lasted about 90 minutes, depending on use. The C1VE lasted about three hours, when used mainly for email and word processing. This is a long way from the eight hours that would make a big difference to mobile notebook PC users. </p> <p>But if the C1VE fails to sell, it will not be fair to blame Transmeta. Most problems are due to Sony's design. Yes, the C1VE is really small (248 x 152 x 27mm), really light (1kg), and it looks terrific. It has a built-in microphone, stereo speakers, and an impressive 12GB hard drive. The main problems are the screen size, and the lack of either a floppy drive or CD-rom or Ethernet networking as standard. </p> <p>The screen has a letterbox shape and you are more or less forced to use the standard resolution of 1024 by 480 pixels, so you have to do a lot of scrolling. Where the Sony screen is less than 10cm deep, the IBM ThinkPad 240 is 16cm while the Toshiba Port\u00e9g\u00e9 3480 measures 17.5cm. </p> <p>The small screen comes with small fonts that make texts hard to read - and you cannot choose large fonts because that option is greyed out in Windows. I would have liked to increase the screen contrast, but this option is also unavailable. </p> <p>Then there is the problem of getting software on to the C1VE. Sony has pre-installed Smart Capture and PictureGear programs to use the built-in camera, which can capture still images or moving video. There's also DVgate for capturing digital video streams piped in through the high-speed i.Link (1394 standard) port, and Movie Shaker, for editing them. But the only word processor is Windows WordPad. To do anything else, you may have to download programs from the net using a dial-up connection. </p> <p>It's bizarre. Mark Hanson, vice president and general manager of Sony's PC product line, told the AP news bureau that the machine \"is tailored toward the travelling business professional\". Sony must have a very odd idea of what business professionals do for a living. They certainly don't sit on planes editing videos, and if they did, they wouldn't use a machine with such a limited letterbox screen. </p> <p>For business professionals, the Jog Dial is a waste of time, the i.Link port is an insult, and the Motion Eye camera is at best an amusing diversion. The machine would have much more business cred if all three were junked (dropping the camera would give room for a bigger screen) in favour of a built-in Ethernet port. All the video software could be replaced with Microsoft Office. </p> <p>Of course, the truth is that the C1VE is a wonderful toy. It could be particularly attractive to teenagers, especially if they already have a Sony Memory Stick Walkman, and a Sony digital video camera with an i.Link port. There probably aren't enough of them around with \u00a31,499 (inc VAT) to spare, but it is nearly Christmas and a good time to be nice to very rich relations, if you have any.</p>",

In the summer of 1998, when he reached 102 and 253 days, he had overtaken the previous longest-lived, the South African Rupert de Smidt who had died in 1986, all of 73 years after playing his last game for Western Province. </p> <p>The oldest Test cricketer remains England's former pace bowler Alf Gover, who will be 93 in February. Not all that far behind Gover, of course, is the nonpareil Sir Don Bradman, who was 92 in August. </p> <p>Hutchinson's uniquely long innings was serene and contented almost to the end. It was only last winter that his wife Anne, a mere slip of a gel in her late 80s, injured a hip in a fall at their home in East Thurnscoe, south Yorkshire, which meant Jim had to move to a Rotherham nursing home. </p> <p>He was the personification of the old northern cricketing adage, \"if thee wants a good player, just whistle down mineshaft for one\". Hutchinson was a Tupton boy and began down the pit at 14. One Saturday in 1920, playing for the colliery XI at Bullcroft near Hull, the opposing wicketkeeper was a Derbyshire member. Three evenings later the 23-year-old was put in a net for a trial and by the Saturday he was making his championship debut against Sussex in Chesterfield. </p> <p>In the next 11 summers he played 255 more matches (averaging 18 with five centuries) and the Derbyshire yearbook described him as \"an effective mid-order bat and perhaps the most outstanding cover-point in the county's history\". </p> <p>When cricket had finished he became chief safety officer at Hickleton Main colliery. Only a year ago, still full of beans and getting about on his zimmer, the centenarian was putting down his longevity to a lifetime diet of \"pork chops and onion rings\". </p> <p>His short-term memory, he said cheerfully, was a total blank. But not that of his straight-backed and manly prime: \"Crikey yes, of course I faced Larwood. He was another miner like me. He was fast all right, deadly fast, but fair with it. </p> <p>\"Of the batters, Woolley was the one to watch, and to fear. If you wanted a ball hitting, Woolley was the one to hit it for you.\" Hutchinson played against Bradman in 1930: \"he looked a small, shy farmer's boy at the crease but you could tell he had something special all right\". </p> <p>Yesterday, cricket's boffins were still poring over their small print before naming Hutchinson's successor as the world's most ancient. But they did announce England's new oldest living first-class player. </p> <p>It is Frank Shipston, 94 last August 29, another ex-miner, who played 49 matches for Nottinghamshire (also averaging 18) for eight years till 1933. I was thrilled to hear dear \"Shippy\" was still alive. </p> <p>At Douai, the now defunct Benedictine monastery school high in the Berkshire hills, Shippy was our coach, head groundsman and umpire through my time in the 1950s. </p> <p>With some shining exceptions a majority of former county cricketers, having spent their salad days treading fresh grass under glorious midsummer suns, in my experience then turn into endearingly pessimistic grousers. That was Shippy. </p> <p>In I'd come, at No6 or 7, Douai invariably needing 100-odd to win, and, first over, I might get lucky and cheerily clunk one into the adjoining tennis courts to, as they say, set out my stall. At which gaunt umpire Shippy would wince and pull a miserably anguished face before, at the end of the over, regarding me with suffering old-spaniel eyes and his confiding whispered mantra, \"What's roosh, lad? Joost tek it easy, play down line and roons'll coom, you see, roons'll coom.\" </p> <p>But they didn't very often for me, I'm afraid. I regularly let down the despairing Shipston and was usually out, aiming for mid-on's nut, well before the six o'clock Angelus chimed down from the school chapel tower. </p> <p>And afterwards in the pav Shippy would shake his head at us sadly, then roll a fag, pour a beer and tell us Trent Bridge tales of Larwood and Gunn, the Hardstaffs and Walter Keeton in the sun-burnished days of his own local fame. And now, suddenly, at 94 not out, his own name is fondly famed over all England.</p>",

In I'd come, at No6 or 7, Douai invariably needing 100-odd to win, and, first over, I might get lucky and cheerily clunk one into the adjoining tennis courts to, as they say, set out my stall. At which gaunt umpire Shippy would wince and pull a miserably anguished face before, at the end of the over, regarding me with suffering old-spaniel eyes and his confiding whispered mantra, \"What's roosh, lad? Joost tek it easy, play down line and roons'll coom, you see, roons'll coom.\" But they didn't very often for me, I'm afraid. I regularly let down the despairing Shipston and was usually out, aiming for mid-on's nut, well before the six o'clock Angelus chimed down from the school chapel tower. And afterwards in the pav Shippy would shake his head at us sadly, then roll a fag, pour a beer and tell us Trent Bridge tales of Larwood and Gunn, the Hardstaffs and Walter Keeton in the sun-burnished days of his own local fame. And now, suddenly, at 94 not out, his own name is fondly famed over all England.",

Lee Dyson, aged 31, from Barnsley, was stabbed after violence in the centre of Milan between rival fans. His condition was described as stable and he was accompanied by members of his family who remained with him at Fatebenefratelli hospital in the city centre. Two Leeds supporters, Christopher Loftus and Kevin Speight, were killed this year in Istanbul before the club's Uefa Cup semi-final first leg against Galatasaray. Peter Ridsdale, the Leeds chairman, said last night: 'Of course the stabbing is of grave concern to us. We understand that the victim is in a stable condition. We hope he makes a speedy recovery. 'My information about the man concerned it that he is a professional man and not the sort of individual who would get involved in trouble.' Ian Shand, a consul at the British consulate in Milan, said Milan police had arrested seven Leeds United fans in several other incidents but that no arrests were made for the stabbing. A police spokesman in Milan, Piero Vincenti, said Dyson was stabbed in the face, hands and abdomen shortly after midnight on a downtown Milan street. About 6,000 Leeds fans were in Milan for the game, the largest away following the club have taken to Europe since the 1975 European Cup final against Bayern Munich in Paris. Hundreds of officers were on duty to prevent trouble and the heavy police presence ensured there were no further outbreaks of violence prior to the match, although there were further skirmishes and police made eight arrests for minor offences. Officials in Milan imposed a ban on the sale of alcohol in the city and liaised closely with officers from the West Yorkshire police as part of the security operation. Ray Fell, chairman of the Leeds United Supporters' Association, said he was 'rather shattered by the stabbing. 'After the deaths of two of our supporters earlier this year in Turkey I hoped it was something we would never have to go through again,' he added.

But he has been forced to dismantle his team after the club ran into financial difficulties; David Weir, Neil McCann, Paul Ritchie and Gary Naysmith have all left the club as the chief executive Chris Robinson tried to cut the wage bill. </p> <p>Though they are fifth in the table they are 19 points adrift of Celtic and recently lost 6-2 to their Edinburgh rivals Hibernian. Fans demonstrated against Robinson after their 3-0 home defeat by St Johnstone two weeks ago but had refrained from criticising their manager. The Under-21 coach Peter Houston will take temporary charge of the first team. </p> <p>Another Scottish manager, Bradford's caretaker Stuart McCall, has ruled himself out of the running to succeed Chris Hutchings full time. </p> <p>The former Scotland midfielder announced his decision after a meeting yesterday with Geoffrey Richmond, the Bradford chairman; he said he wanted to continue playing as long as possible. He will remain as caretaker, assisted by the former Wales goalkeeper Neville Southall, until a permanent appointment is made. </p> <p>\"While I feel I am having a positive influence on the park, I believe this is the best way I can assist Bradford,\" McCall said. </p> <p>\"I do not believe I can do the manager's position justice while I am still playing at Premiership level. The time will come when I hang up my boots, and my ambition in the future is to become a manager should the opportunity arise.\" </p> <p>Southampton's Ivory Coast-born striker Patrice Tano has left the club and returned to France after having his contract cancelled only four months after arriving at the Dell. </p> <p>He was signed by Glenn Hoddle from the manager's former club Monaco on a free transfer in July but has since made only two starts for the reserves and has now been released amid passport difficulties. </p> <p>Southampton refused to allow Tano to sign a contract at the Dell until he produced a valid French passport and he has been sent home after failing to obtain one. </p> <p>The Wimbledon midfielder Robbie Earle has decided to end his playing career on the advice of a specialist after failing to recover from a stomach injury. He will remain at the club as reserve-team manager. </p> <p>Earle played more than 650 games for Port Vale and Wimbledon, and scored Jamaica's first-ever goal in the World Cup finals in 1998. He was made an MBE for his services to football. </p> <p>His final game was a reserve-team fixture against Watford in March, when a collision with his own goalkeeper led to a potentially life-threatening pancreatic problem.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Hearts yesterday announced that their manager Jim Jefferies and his assistant Billy Brown had left the club by mutual consent. Jefferies led Hearts to the Scottish Cup in 1998 and third place in the Premier League last season. But he has been forced to dismantle his team after the club ran into financial difficulties; David Weir, Neil McCann, Paul Ritchie and Gary Naysmith have all left the club as the chief executive Chris Robinson tried to cut the wage bill. Though they are fifth in the table they are 19 points adrift of Celtic and recently lost 6-2 to their Edinburgh rivals Hibernian. Fans demonstrated against Robinson after their 3-0 home defeat by St Johnstone two weeks ago but had refrained from criticising their manager. The Under-21 coach Peter Houston will take temporary charge of the first team. Another Scottish manager, Bradford's caretaker Stuart McCall, has ruled himself out of the running to succeed Chris Hutchings full time. The former Scotland midfielder announced his decision after a meeting yesterday with Geoffrey Richmond, the Bradford chairman; he said he wanted to continue playing as long as possible. He will remain as caretaker, assisted by the former Wales goalkeeper Neville Southall, until a permanent appointment is made. \"While I feel I am having a positive influence on the park, I believe this is the best way I can assist Bradford,\" McCall said. \"I do not believe I can do the manager's position justice while I am still playing at Premiership level. The time will come when I hang up my boots, and my ambition in the future is to become a manager should the opportunity arise.\" Southampton's Ivory Coast-born striker Patrice Tano has left the club and returned to France after having his contract cancelled only four months after arriving at the Dell. He was signed by Glenn Hoddle from the manager's former club Monaco on a free transfer in July but has since made only two starts for the reserves and has now been released amid passport difficulties. Southampton refused to allow Tano to sign a contract at the Dell until he produced a valid French passport and he has been sent home after failing to obtain one. The Wimbledon midfielder Robbie Earle has decided to end his playing career on the advice of a specialist after failing to recover from a stomach injury. He will remain at the club as reserve-team manager. Earle played more than 650 games for Port Vale and Wimbledon, and scored Jamaica's first-ever goal in the World Cup finals in 1998. He was made an MBE for his services to football. His final game was a reserve-team fixture against Watford in March, when a collision with his own goalkeeper led to a potentially life-threatening pancreatic problem.",

At Cambridge he falls in with the Bloomsbury group and is painted in the buff by Duncan Grant, slavered over by Lytton Strachey and directed in Faustus by Rupert Brooke. But his real mentor is Geoffrey Young, who teaches him the joys of not only climbing but of combining it with philosophical debate and clubby fellowship. One point Holloway makes strongly, through an angry Australian abseiling down the face of the dress circle, is that British mountaineering was once deeply class-ridden. </p> <p>In a sense, that was Mallory's undoing. There was something about him of the reckless, inspired amateur; and for the final assault on Everest he chooses as his companion a 22-year-old Oxford rowing blue with minimal climbing experience. Holloway's thesis, reinforced by the discovery last year of Mallory's mummified corpse, is that the pair did reach the summit. What caused their death was a mixture of darkness, Irvine's inexperience and a recurrence of Mallory's neglected leg wound. Having lived his life according to romantic ideals, the \"Galahad of Everest\" perished by them. </p> <p>Holloway's drama has some odd gaps. A literal cliffhanger at the end of the first half is quickly forgotten. The format of a demythologising lecture by the expedition's photographer is soon discarded. But, even if the play is as much social history and character study as drama, it captures the lost Corinthian world that Mallory and his kind inhabited. They attack Everest in tweeds, forget to take signal flares to the summit and refer to the local porters as \"coolies\". </p> <p>But the play gets ruthlessly professional direction and design from Giles Croft and Jamie Vartan, whose set shifts from a metallic climbing frame, which the actors perilously negotiate, to a sloping-roofed Everest camp that turns into the snow-capped summit. Hywel Morgan's Mallory is the right mix of Phoebus Apollo and risk-taker, Simon Coury is doubly effective as both his pipe-smoking mentor and Lytton Strachey, and Sebastian Dunn is the doomed Irvine. Holloway may not scale Ibsenite peaks but he evokes an era when mountain-climbing was seen as a form of romantic Arthurian quest. </p> <p>Until November 25. Box office: 0115-941 9419.</p>",

But it shares the Grass's appetite for the poison of 20th-century history, his monstrous relish for truth. </p> <p>In his new paintings, Kiefer imagines his history as if he had been Chinese. Let a Thousand Flowers Bloom, this series of paintings and huge books, resembling mud-drenched sculptures, evokes Mao Zedong's call to intellectuals in 1957 to contribute their ideas freely to communism. \"Let a hundred flowers bloom,\" said Mao, \"let a hundred schools of thought contend.\" Mao's invitation turned out to be lethal; many intellectuals were forced to work on the land in the cultural revolution. </p> <p>In Kiefer's massive paintings, the Chinese landscape is whipped up into a wall of colour; it is the space of both Mao's utopian idyll, where poppies float in harmony, and the desolate country of the intellectual forced to labour. Kiefer paints Mao as a Prospero figure who raises his arm in a gesture of revolutionary abundance. One image has Mao's statue casting his spell over a derelict factory, but no flowers materialise. Instead, a stuffed demonic snake whips across the canvas. </p> <p>As Chinese history fuses with Kiefer's German past, Maoism is represented as black magic. Mao raises his arm in what looks like a Nazi salute. The point of Kiefer's art is to inoculate against the past by exposing the present to history's dirty residue; burning, smothering and other forms of violence determine the texture of his paintings. In Kiefer's China, that means an ambiguous mourning for communism. His Mao is not the icon painted by Andy Warhol. Kiefer's paintings are not ironic: they express real loathing for Mao - a Hitler speaking the language of flowers - yet a real longing for utopia. </p> <p>History is a traumatised landscape in these paintings, a killing field. Poppies float in a field of brown, mustard and blood-red, as Prospero conjures up a society. In the books that record Kiefer's research, the photographs he took in China disappear under dirt, mud and sand, as an ancient landscape reasserts itself. The Yangtse swells in clotted lumps and Mao's portrait, floating on the tide, remains for generations to decode. What happened here? Kiefer's paintings offer no answers; some might see them as fashionable pessimism. But his paintings monumentalise history without simplifying it. </p> <p>Until December 12.

In the books that record Kiefer's research, the photographs he took in China disappear under dirt, mud and sand, as an ancient landscape reasserts itself. The Yangtse swells in clotted lumps and Mao's portrait, floating on the tide, remains for generations to decode. What happened here? Kiefer's paintings offer no answers; some might see them as fashionable pessimism. But his paintings monumentalise history without simplifying it. Until December 12. Details: 020-7499 4100.",

At the other was Taylor's 1981 version of Sacre du Printemps, whose narrative mixes Nijinksy's choreography with Keystone Cops, Russian peasants with Chinese crooks. </p> <p>But the one truth about Taylor's unruly imagination is that surfaces deceive. The athleticism of Cascade may look ingenuous yet within its leaps and turns are surprising gestures and rhythmic inflections that snag the flow. Steps that seem to bound over the surface of Bach's accompanying score (Concerto for piano and orchestra) dig into unexpected musical details, while duets that seem straightforwardly romantic throw up images of poignancy or regret. And most extraordinary is the long solo at its centre (danced with precision by Lisa Viola), which seems like a communion with mysterious gods. </p> <p>Alone on the stage, Viola lifts her arms in hieratic incantation then tilts, wounded, back towards the floor: her body fragments under the pressure of unspoken conflict. The choreography teases us to puzzle out how this pagan ritual comes to be enacted within the classical architecture of Bach. </p> <p>The solo is not only compelling; it is good training for watching Sacre, whose shuffled images resist all logic. Trying to rationalise how a New York dance rehearsal morphs into gangster dive, and how a kidnapped baby instigates mass killing is impossible. But Taylor's parodic choreography and his comic timing wrap the stories up so fast that you will never listen to Stravinsky's score in the same way. </p> <p>In Piazolla Caldera (1997) Taylor nearly succeeds in reinventing the music of Astor Piazolla, which accompanies the piece. Although his costumes and steps are tango- inspired, this is not a second-hand tango show, for filtered through its barnstorming dance routines are Taylor's views on the needy appetites of sex, the lonely narcissism of the dance floor and the cloudy no-man's land of alcohol. It is a showcase for Taylor's eclectic group and for the genius of Jennifer Tipton. It is also a reminder that it has been more than nine years since the company's last London appearance. Dance fans deserve better. </p> <p>Until Saturday. Box office: 020-7863 8000.</p>",

A Handful of Dust by Evelyn Waugh</strong><br>A concise, spare, funny yet brutal account of marital infidelity. Without ever losing a lightness of touch, this novel somehow amounts to one of the most misanthropic books you will ever read.</p> <p><strong>2. Earthly Powers by Anthony Burgess</strong><br>An entire lifetime of sexual (and just about every other kind of) angst. The protagonist is gay, but his endless struggle to fend off loneliness with love couldn't be more universal.<br><strong><br>3. A Severed Head by Iris Murdoch</strong><br>Of all the lots-of-people-screwing -lots-of-other-people novels this is probably the best, and certainly the weirdest. With less philosophising and more shagging than Murdoch's other books, it is a joy to see this wonderful writer let her hair (and her knickers) down.</p> <p><strong>4. The Great Gatsby by F Scott Fitzgerald</strong><br>There must be hundreds of novels that call themselves \"the greatest love story of our time\" in the blurb. This is the only one where it's true.</p> <p><strong>5. Underworld by Don DeLillo</strong><br>This novel belongs on any list, since it seems to achieve just about everything a work of fiction can. The various marriages, families and love affairs that twine through this epic narrative are as brilliantly conceived as everything else in this truly extraordinary novel.</p> <p><strong>6. Rabbit, Run by John Updike</strong><br>No marriage can have faced a sterner examination than that of the Angstroms. Rabbit, Run seems like a stunning dissection of everything that can possibly go wrong in a marriage, until you read the rest of the tetralogy and discover that things can get worse, decade by decade. No one else so brilliantly reveals the extraordinary in the ordinary.</p> <p><strong>7. The Fermata by Nicholson Baker</strong><br>Baker explores the dividing line between literature and pornography, and much of the time seems to decide that the latter is more interesting. Rarely have I read a more tumescent book. Which brings me to . .</p> <p><strong>8. Portnoy's Complaint by Philip Roth</strong><br>Winner of the literary tumescence prize, there is more to this novel than masturbation. Every variety of sexual frustration is explored here in hilarious detail. For auto-erotomanes everywhere this book has the status of a Bible.</p> <p><strong>9. The Cement Garden by Ian McEwan</strong><br>While we're on the subject of sexual perversions, a little incest seems obligatory. This gruesome, twisted, filthy little novel is probably the best thing McEwan has ever written.</p> <p><strong>10. The French Lieutenant's Woman by John Fowles</strong><br>Not wanting to end on too smutty a note, this is a proper love story again, with obsessive love thwarted by Victorian morality. If unrequited, suppressed passions are the kind that hit your spot, this is the place to look.</p>",

      "bodyText": "William Sutcliffe is the author of New Boy, Are You Experienced?, and The Love Hexagon, which follows the interrelated romantic and sexual adventures of six young Londoners. Buy The Love Hexagon at Amazon.co.uk 1. A Handful of Dust by Evelyn Waugh A concise, spare, funny yet brutal account of marital infidelity. Without ever losing a lightness of touch, this novel somehow amounts to one of the most misanthropic books you will ever read. 2. Earthly Powers by Anthony Burgess An entire lifetime of sexual (and just about every other kind of) angst. The protagonist is gay, but his endless struggle to fend off loneliness with love couldn't be more universal. 3. A Severed Head by Iris Murdoch Of all the lots-of-people-screwing -lots-of-other-people novels this is probably the best, and certainly the weirdest. With less philosophising and more shagging than Murdoch's other books, it is a joy to see this wonderful writer let her hair (and her knickers) down. 4. The Great Gatsby by F Scott Fitzgerald There must be hundreds of novels that call themselves \"the greatest love story of our time\" in the blurb. This is the only one where it's true. 5. Underworld by Don DeLillo This novel belongs on any list, since it seems to achieve just about everything a work of fiction can. The various marriages, families and love affairs that twine through this epic narrative are as brilliantly conceived as everything else in this truly extraordinary novel. 6. Rabbit, Run by John Updike No marriage can have faced a sterner examination than that of the Angstroms. Rabbit, Run seems like a stunning dissection of everything that can possibly go wrong in a marriage, until you read the rest of the tetralogy and discover that things can get worse, decade by decade. No one else so brilliantly reveals the extraordinary in the ordinary. 7. The Fermata by Nicholson Baker Baker explores the dividing line between literature and pornography, and much of the time seems to decide that the latter is more interesting. Rarely have I read a more tumescent book. Which brings me to . . 8. Portnoy's Complaint by Philip Roth Winner of the literary tumescence prize, there is more to this novel than masturbation. Every variety of sexual frustration is explored here in hilarious detail. For auto-erotomanes everywhere this book has the status of a Bible. 9. The Cement Garden by Ian McEwan While we're on the subject of sexual perversions, a little incest seems obligatory. This gruesome, twisted, filthy little novel is probably the best thing McEwan has ever written. 10. The French Lieutenant's Woman by John Fowles Not wanting to end on too smutty a note, this is a proper love story again, with obsessive love thwarted by Victorian morality. If unrequited, suppressed passions are the kind that hit your spot, this is the place to look.",
