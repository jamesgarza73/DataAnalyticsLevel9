The rest of the programme got progressively easier for the listener as it got more difficult for the soloist, ending with that old violin chestnut, a fantasy on Carmen (in this case, excerpts from three different pieces glued seamlessly together), that drew the desired ovation from the audience. But if Shaham is going to be a truly great recital artist he'll have to rely on musicianship rather than on pure display. ***** Unmissable **** Recommended *** Enjoyable ** Mediocre * Terrible",

      "bodyText": "Jitters over hi-tech stocks returned yesterday as London's technology index fell another 5% amid anxiety, stemming from the other side of the Atlantic, about the future of Microsoft, the sector giant. Yesterday's trading, during which the once-soaring techmark index fell by 247 points to 4,083, followed last week's turbulence in the dot.com sector which had been propelled higher earlier this year by frenzied buying of smaller stocks by private investors. Dealers in London said yesterday's further slide was fuelled by the fall in the US Nasdaq market . At one stage it suffered its worst fall in points terms on record as expectations mounted that the US Justice Department would rule that Microsoft had abused its dominance in the software industry. Such fears had allowed Cisco, its rival, briefly to eclipse Microsoft as the the world's biggest company last week. In Europe, the picture was the same. France's Nouveau March\u00e9 index for small, high- growth stocks ended down 9.7%. The difficult conditions for the hi-tech, media and telecoms stocks, which fuelled much of the rally earlier in the year, came amid an unprecedented four-and-a-half hour suspension of the key FTSE 100, and other UK stock market indices, as a result of technical difficulties. In what was described as a \"debacle\" by City traders, Reuters, the media and information group which provides the stock prices to FTSE International to calculate a range of UK stock market indices, was forced to admit that a \"communications problem\" with the stock exchange had stopped it being able to provide the all-important data. Its problems, which are now the subject of an internal investigation, also mean that thousands of City dealers who rely on Reuters prices to trade were left without information for up to 90 minutes in early trading yesterday. Only firms relying on Reuters were affected as other firms which provide the price information about share levels were not reported to have experienced any problems. A spokesman for FTSE International, which compiles the indices, refused to comment on speculation that Reuters might lose its contract with the firm. \"We obviously take it very seriously,\" a spokesman for FTSE International said, adding a detailed review would be held with Reuters to ensure such an incident could not be repeated. The FTSE 100 index - eventually quoted for the first time at 12.34pm - fell 78 points to 6,462. It should have been updated continuously from the market opening at 8am.",

Wigan leapfrog Bristol Rovers into second place after Neil Redfearn's third goal in two games, and an own-goal from Darren Powell brought a 2-0 win at Brentford, Wigan's fourth win in succession. \u0095 Burnley stayed on course with a 2-1 win at Cardiff. Steve Davis gave the Clarets the lead after 21 minutes and Andy Payton's 24th of the season increased the advantage before an Ian Cox own-goal threw the Welshmen a lifeline they failed to grasp despite playing against 10 men when Burnley's Colin Little was sent off after 73 minutes. \u0095 An attack on Stoke City's goalkeeper Gavin Ward overshadowed Peter Thorne's hat-trick for City, which put them in front against Bristol Rovers after 10 minutes and brought the equaliser five minutes from the end for a 3-3 draw. \u0095 Millwall could only manage a 1-1 draw at Notts County, Neil Harris's 18th of the season putting them in front after 13 minutes only for Duane Darby to level just past the hour. \u0095 Gillingham kept in the play-off group, thanks to Steve Butler's 75th-minute winner against doomed Chesterfield. \u0095 Bristol City made it four in a row with a 2-1 win at Wycombe, Tony Thorpe's 11th of the season putting them in front. Sean Devine equalised before Damien Spencer grabbed the winner. \u0095 Oxford climbed out of the bottom three with a 1-0 win over Bournemouth.",

But their challengers cannot match them for consistency, depth of talent or options in attack. No one has the same big-game temperament either. When United have to perform, they do.

As it stands, with a 10-point lead, United need four wins to confirm the inevitable. </p> <p>\"Some of their football in the second half was irresistible,\" Redknapp said. \"Their movement and passing was from another level.

If his boots are worth \u00a313,800, what price a crossing and dead-ball tutorial? The free-kick he arrowed past Forrest for No6 was arguably surpassed by the centre he conjured for Andy Cole to head the third. There were others like it. \"You can rarely come for anything because he whips them in six to eight yards out,\" Forrest said. \"I can't remember a cross I could have come for.\" The keeper finished with a groin injury; after picking the ball out of the net so often it was a wonder he did not have back strain, too.

Of his starting XI Denis Irwin alone is over 30. \"They can keep producing, keep buying, do whatever they want to do,\" Redknapp said. </p> <p>So will the Premiership become a one-horse race? \"The Arsenals and Chelseas and Liverpools have got the resources to keep pushing them,\" Redknapp said. \"They're very, very strong.

      "body": "<p>Aston Villa reached their first FA Cup final for 43 years here yesterday by a route which was both tortuous and, at least until extra-time, torturous. After two scoreless hours they finally defeated Bolton Wanderers on penalties, Dion Dublin, recently recovered from a broken neck, scoring the decisive goal. </p> <p>A largely forgettable but ultimately dramatic semi-final was in essence a story of one man's misses leading to another's smiles. How Dean Holdsworth, having just seen a free-kick hit a post, managed to waft the ball over an empty net after David James had left his line in the second period of extra-time only the Bolton striker knew. </p> <p>Certainly Dublin, having seen a header pushed against a post three minutes from the end, had no intention of wasting his redeeming moment in the shootout, after James had saved kicks from Allan Johnston and Michael Johansen to set Villa up for victory.</p> <p>Aston Villa are not the first side to win an FA Cup semi-final on penalties, Liverpool did as much when they beat Portsmouth in 1992, but they are the first to do so without a replay. Then, Portsmouth had twice bettered Graeme Souness's team and while Bolton did not quite achieve that Villa could not have complained had either of Holdsworth's shots gone in. </p> <p>Two minutes previously Villa, having lost Ian Taylor to an early injury, had been reduced to 10 men following David Elleray's dismissal of Mark Delaney for two bookable fouls on Johnston in the space of four minutes. Even John Gregory, the Villa manager and hardly an Elleray fan, could not have disputed the sending-off, though the way his team reorganised with 10 men was admirable. </p> <p>More admirable, to be sure, than much of what went before when Aston Villa, rather than their First Division opponents, appeared frozen by the occasion.

      "bodyText": "Aston Villa reached their first FA Cup final for 43 years here yesterday by a route which was both tortuous and, at least until extra-time, torturous. After two scoreless hours they finally defeated Bolton Wanderers on penalties, Dion Dublin, recently recovered from a broken neck, scoring the decisive goal. A largely forgettable but ultimately dramatic semi-final was in essence a story of one man's misses leading to another's smiles. How Dean Holdsworth, having just seen a free-kick hit a post, managed to waft the ball over an empty net after David James had left his line in the second period of extra-time only the Bolton striker knew. Certainly Dublin, having seen a header pushed against a post three minutes from the end, had no intention of wasting his redeeming moment in the shootout, after James had saved kicks from Allan Johnston and Michael Johansen to set Villa up for victory. Aston Villa are not the first side to win an FA Cup semi-final on penalties, Liverpool did as much when they beat Portsmouth in 1992, but they are the first to do so without a replay. Then, Portsmouth had twice bettered Graeme Souness's team and while Bolton did not quite achieve that Villa could not have complained had either of Holdsworth's shots gone in. Two minutes previously Villa, having lost Ian Taylor to an early injury, had been reduced to 10 men following David Elleray's dismissal of Mark Delaney for two bookable fouls on Johnston in the space of four minutes. Even John Gregory, the Villa manager and hardly an Elleray fan, could not have disputed the sending-off, though the way his team reorganised with 10 men was admirable. More admirable, to be sure, than much of what went before when Aston Villa, rather than their First Division opponents, appeared frozen by the occasion. Even the better sides can sometimes struggle to get out of the lower gears, but Villa never really played the sort of football designed to bring out their strengths. For too long the ability of Paul Merson to run at opponents or pick out colleagues with finely weighted passes was ignored as Villa pumped high balls towards their little strikers, Julian Joachim and Benito Carbone. And when Dublin eventually came off the bench 20 minutes from the end of normal time the more effective Carbone was the man Gregory took off, despite Joachim having squandered three chances before half-time. Carbone retired with the dignity of a three-year-old being led past the sweet counter at Tesco, flinging down his headband and kicking the trainer's bucket. At the end of the match he threw his dazzling footwear into a crowd of Villa supporters, and one had to wonder about the mentality of a striker who awards himself two golden boots to begin with. At the outset, and for a long time thereafter, Bolton appeared to have the most likely match-winner in Eidur Gudjohnsen, the 21-year-old Icelandic striker who had scored in each of the previous four rounds. A combination of Gudjohnsen's burly physique and his ability to turn tightly with the ball gave Ugo Ehiogu a particularly difficult afternoon and so nearly brought Bolton a goal after 19 minutes. Johnston cleverly turned in from the left before laying the ball off to Gudjohnsen, who turned between Ehiogu and Gareth Southgate and saw his shot beat James only to be turned clear by a flick of Alan Wright's head. Until extra time that was the closest Bolton came to scoring. Despite their poverty Aston Villa could have had the match won by half-time.

Perhaps a good dinner could solve the problem.\" </p> <p>Knowing Arsenal's luck, the meal will end with a disagreement over who picks up the bill and Wenger will be cautioned for arguing. </p> <p>On Saturday Oleg Luzhny became the 29th Arsenal player sent off during Wenger's 3 year stewardship, the seventh this season and the third in the team's last four games. It is a grim record, but as the manager pointed out, none of the last three dismissals offers evidence of a dirty streak. </p> <p>Thierry Henry was dismissed for a nothing tackle against Werder Bremen, Gilles Grimandi for two yellows against Spurs, and Luzhny for ending Andreas Lund's 43rd-minute run on goal when replays cast doubt on whether the Ukrainian either touched Lund or was the last defender. But if the referee Uriah Rennie made Arsenal reach for his medicinal namesake on that occasion, the Yorkshireman did get right three other decisions for which he was roundly criticised later. </p> <p>Marcus Gayle's first-half run into the area was ended by a fall not a foul - no penalty. Nwankwo Kanu was not offside for Arsenal's 33rd-minute equaliser after being put through by Dennis Bergkamp, and, near full-time, Jason Euell played the man before the ball, earning himself a red card and Arsenal a third goal from the penalty spot courtesy of Euell's victim, Thierry Henry. </p> <p>Along with Kanu's earlier free header from Silvinho's corner, it completed an Arsenal comeback that, after Lund's 12th minute goal, had been sparked by their reduction to 10 men. </p> <p>With resilience and organisation, Arsenal dug out their first away Premiership win since December, reinforced their challenge for a Champions League spot, and lifted the collective spirit ahead of Thursday's Uefa Cup semi-final first leg against Lens. </p> <p>Arsenal have now won five games on the bounce and, with \u00a335m reportedly about to be invested by Carlton Communications, the sun is shining again on N5. The only clouds are the back injury threatening Tony Adams' fitness for club and country plus the availability of Kanu for equally familiar reasons. </p> <p>Under Fifa rules he should be released on Wednesday for Nigeria's World Cup qualifier in Eritrea on Sunday. But Wenger wants Kanu to leave on Friday after playing Lens.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ars\u00e8ne Wenger is so mystified about why his side are always picking up red cards that he is contemplating a booking of his own. \"Maybe I should invite some referees to explain why we have so many sendings-off. Perhaps a good dinner could solve the problem.\" Knowing Arsenal's luck, the meal will end with a disagreement over who picks up the bill and Wenger will be cautioned for arguing. On Saturday Oleg Luzhny became the 29th Arsenal player sent off during Wenger's 3 year stewardship, the seventh this season and the third in the team's last four games. It is a grim record, but as the manager pointed out, none of the last three dismissals offers evidence of a dirty streak. Thierry Henry was dismissed for a nothing tackle against Werder Bremen, Gilles Grimandi for two yellows against Spurs, and Luzhny for ending Andreas Lund's 43rd-minute run on goal when replays cast doubt on whether the Ukrainian either touched Lund or was the last defender. But if the referee Uriah Rennie made Arsenal reach for his medicinal namesake on that occasion, the Yorkshireman did get right three other decisions for which he was roundly criticised later. Marcus Gayle's first-half run into the area was ended by a fall not a foul - no penalty. Nwankwo Kanu was not offside for Arsenal's 33rd-minute equaliser after being put through by Dennis Bergkamp, and, near full-time, Jason Euell played the man before the ball, earning himself a red card and Arsenal a third goal from the penalty spot courtesy of Euell's victim, Thierry Henry. Along with Kanu's earlier free header from Silvinho's corner, it completed an Arsenal comeback that, after Lund's 12th minute goal, had been sparked by their reduction to 10 men. With resilience and organisation, Arsenal dug out their first away Premiership win since December, reinforced their challenge for a Champions League spot, and lifted the collective spirit ahead of Thursday's Uefa Cup semi-final first leg against Lens. Arsenal have now won five games on the bounce and, with \u00a335m reportedly about to be invested by Carlton Communications, the sun is shining again on N5. The only clouds are the back injury threatening Tony Adams' fitness for club and country plus the availability of Kanu for equally familiar reasons. Under Fifa rules he should be released on Wednesday for Nigeria's World Cup qualifier in Eritrea on Sunday. But Wenger wants Kanu to leave on Friday after playing Lens.",

Armed with a Dickensian stick, the teachers manage to keep 120 or 140 of them sitting down on the stools or stones which they bring each morning to their dark, dusty schoolrooms.</p> <p>Chalk and a blackboard are the only teaching equipment most of the staff have. Some lack even that, so they scratch lessons on the wall.</p> <p>Kindergarten children sing, older children repeat aloud the teacher's lessons in English and Arabic.</p> <p>Across town, Our Lady of Fatima primary school has nearly 1,000 children, and new ones arrive every day, including many from six other schools. Here too, pupils are crammed into classrooms empty except for the benches or stools brought each day.</p> <p>At midday, lined up in neat rows for assembly in the courtyard and enthusiastically singing Christian hymns, they could be taken for children from any school on any continent. But that these schools are operating at all is a miracle made by a group of teachers and parents.</p> <p>The town of Makeni, in central Sierra Leone, has been behind rebel lines since being taken by the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) in December 1998. There is no town administration, no police, no electricity, no functioning water or sanitation. Every piece of school furniture and equipment has been looted; even doors and windows have been damaged or taken for firewood. Roofs and walls have many bullet holes.</p> <p>When the RUF moved in, many teachers fled to Freetown, the capital down on the coast. Others went there to try to collect salaries months overdue. Few have returned.</p> <p>The schools were closed for six months, many families left, and Makeni drifted in the limbo of non-government that has been the fate of most of Sierra Leone during the eight years of the RUF's violent struggle to take power.</p> <p>Even now, with a tense ceasefire holding, UN troops garrisoned outside the town, and the RUF and other armed factions sharing power in Freetown with the official government of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, there is a power vacuum in towns like Makeni.</p> <p>The Committee of Concerned Teachers and Parents formed itself to end that void, at least in education. They would teach again, no matter how big the classes had to be, so that no child would be turned away. None of them has been paid for many months; some are retired teachers who have volunteered, some are students.</p> <p>Most look exhausted and extremely thin, an occasional one privately shows that they are on the verge of despair, but everyone has too much dignity to complain.</p> <p>Their coordinator is George Coker, once a teacher of business studies, an orderly man who keeps records of every school reopened, every teacher and his or her qualifications, every child who returns to school, exactly as if he were working in a normal setting.</p> <p>He runs the committee from a room with two battered chairs and tables. He has no transport to get across town, no funds, no pool of teachers to relieve the pressure on those facing more than 100 children every day. But he is a man still able to dream of a future for himself very different from the Makeni of today. He likes to talk of a time when he will do computer and keyboard training.</p> <p>He is not the only one keeping his dreams alive. On one blackboard in Our Lady of Fatima school complicated long division and multiplication sums are written up impeccably by the dozen or more children in the top class, the ones the teachers intend should sit the country's examination for secondary school.</p> <p>Those who pass will go to St Joseph's, a once-beautiful school with courtyards set un der great flowering trees on the outskirts of town.</p> <p>One courtyard is now destroyed, looted and burned. In every classroom round the second square, children sit on window-sills or whatever they have brought from home, and work from books bought in the market and shared or used for the teacher to read to them.</p> <p>Among them are many teenagers who were with the RUF, abducted at various times but now bent on making up the time they have lost to a life of mindless brutality.</p> <p>Many of these children have come back to Makeni and found their families gone: dead, or fled to Freetown, they usually don't know. The teachers watch them with concern, wondering how they manage to live and with whom, but stand back from them: children who have lived lives no one wants to think about.</p> <p>The literature class is studying from one battered copy of Things Fall Apart, the great novel by Chinua Achebe about traditional life and the encroachment of colonialism in Nigeria earlier this century. \"They like it very much,\" says the teacher, without irony. He has chosen it for its literary qualities, not for its political message.</p> <p>Like the teachers of Makeni, the peasants of Koya town, a settlement on a rocky hillside outside Freetown, have taken extraordinary steps to give their children an education. They have created a non-formal school which is a model for other deprived communities where the children are needed for daily work and where there is little or no family income.</p> <p>Bangladesh's experience of non-formal education provided the pattern; teaching materials and expert advice have been given by a local group, the People's Education Association of Sierra Leone, and the UN agency Unicef.</p> <p>About 4,000 people displaced by the war have settled in Koya over the years, arriving with nothing. The little houses are built over a wide area of steep hill dotted with huge black boulders. The near est formal school is three miles down the hill, small and already too crowded; the health centre is four miles away; the only water is from a stream up in the hills, a good trek away.</p> <p>Few people in the community are literate. The women say that almost none of them went to school at all when they were children.</p> <p>But the war, and being forced to move, changed their ideas and fired a passion for education, including for their girls. \"The war was senseless and made everyone poorer, but maybe one good thing has come out of it: everyone wants their girls to learn to read,\" one of the village elders says in the unmistakable clipped English of the colonial days.</p> <p>A parents' committee built a school with stones, and wattle cut from the hillside. They dug a latrine and flattened a football pitch. To generate a small income to pay school fees to support the teachers, the men break stones and carry them down to the main road to sell; the women have made little gardens of okra, spinach and peppers which they too sell.</p> <p>One woman, Elizabeth, made soap, until in January last year the rebels entered Freetown and she, like many of the other women in Koya, saw her world collapse a second time. The RUF burned her house, soap-making tools and possessions, and killed her husband.</p> <p>Packed tight into the six classrooms, separated only by open wattle partitions, are 220 children. They do a three-year course; mornings only, so they can work with their families the rest of the day. The goal is that by the fourth year they will be ready to join the formal school system.</p> <p>The sound of class 1's Arabic teacher mingles with class 2's arithmetic and class 3's health education. The six teachers, one a woman, have 10 years' schooling themselves or, in the case of Ahmed, the lead teacher, 12 years.</p> <p>Later this year 16 of their pupils will take the exam for secondary school (though the nearest one is five miles away). The village is prepared to build its own secondary school if necessary.</p> <p>The fever for education is everywhere. \"Since the war rural people came here to Freetown and saw another life,\" says Abraham John, the manager of an adult literacy class in a camp for displaced people on the outskirts of the capital.</p> <p>Across the dusty courtyard of the camp, an old clay factory, Lucy Korwah is teaching a class of 110 displaced children with slates and chalk.</p> <p>She is displaced herself. As she fled through the bush in 1991 she lost two of her children and became separated from her husband. She also lost her sister, and is bringing up three of the sister's children with her own remaining four.</p> <p>There are no intact families here. A third of the children have lost their parents, and among the traumatised children in class there are former RUF child soldiers.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the headteacher, Mariana Kemoh, says with quiet pride that in this primary school for the displaced all those in the top class who sat the national primary school examination passed.</p> <p><b> Liberia</b></p> <p>Illiteracy 80% <br> Primary school attendance 59% <br> Below the poverty line 80% <br> </p> <p><b>Sierra Leone</b></p> <p>Illiteracy 80% <br> School enrollment (6-14) 45% <br> 300 schools destroyed <br> 10,000 children separated from families <br> 5,000 child combatants</p>",

But that these schools are operating at all is a miracle made by a group of teachers and parents. The town of Makeni, in central Sierra Leone, has been behind rebel lines since being taken by the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) in December 1998. There is no town administration, no police, no electricity, no functioning water or sanitation. Every piece of school furniture and equipment has been looted; even doors and windows have been damaged or taken for firewood. Roofs and walls have many bullet holes. When the RUF moved in, many teachers fled to Freetown, the capital down on the coast. Others went there to try to collect salaries months overdue. Few have returned. The schools were closed for six months, many families left, and Makeni drifted in the limbo of non-government that has been the fate of most of Sierra Leone during the eight years of the RUF's violent struggle to take power. Even now, with a tense ceasefire holding, UN troops garrisoned outside the town, and the RUF and other armed factions sharing power in Freetown with the official government of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, there is a power vacuum in towns like Makeni. The Committee of Concerned Teachers and Parents formed itself to end that void, at least in education. They would teach again, no matter how big the classes had to be, so that no child would be turned away. None of them has been paid for many months; some are retired teachers who have volunteered, some are students. Most look exhausted and extremely thin, an occasional one privately shows that they are on the verge of despair, but everyone has too much dignity to complain. Their coordinator is George Coker, once a teacher of business studies, an orderly man who keeps records of every school reopened, every teacher and his or her qualifications, every child who returns to school, exactly as if he were working in a normal setting. He runs the committee from a room with two battered chairs and tables. He has no transport to get across town, no funds, no pool of teachers to relieve the pressure on those facing more than 100 children every day. But he is a man still able to dream of a future for himself very different from the Makeni of today. He likes to talk of a time when he will do computer and keyboard training. He is not the only one keeping his dreams alive. On one blackboard in Our Lady of Fatima school complicated long division and multiplication sums are written up impeccably by the dozen or more children in the top class, the ones the teachers intend should sit the country's examination for secondary school. Those who pass will go to St Joseph's, a once-beautiful school with courtyards set un der great flowering trees on the outskirts of town. One courtyard is now destroyed, looted and burned. In every classroom round the second square, children sit on window-sills or whatever they have brought from home, and work from books bought in the market and shared or used for the teacher to read to them. Among them are many teenagers who were with the RUF, abducted at various times but now bent on making up the time they have lost to a life of mindless brutality. Many of these children have come back to Makeni and found their families gone: dead, or fled to Freetown, they usually don't know. The teachers watch them with concern, wondering how they manage to live and with whom, but stand back from them: children who have lived lives no one wants to think about. The literature class is studying from one battered copy of Things Fall Apart, the great novel by Chinua Achebe about traditional life and the encroachment of colonialism in Nigeria earlier this century. \"They like it very much,\" says the teacher, without irony. He has chosen it for its literary qualities, not for its political message. Like the teachers of Makeni, the peasants of Koya town, a settlement on a rocky hillside outside Freetown, have taken extraordinary steps to give their children an education. They have created a non-formal school which is a model for other deprived communities where the children are needed for daily work and where there is little or no family income. Bangladesh's experience of non-formal education provided the pattern; teaching materials and expert advice have been given by a local group, the People's Education Association of Sierra Leone, and the UN agency Unicef. About 4,000 people displaced by the war have settled in Koya over the years, arriving with nothing. The little houses are built over a wide area of steep hill dotted with huge black boulders. The near est formal school is three miles down the hill, small and already too crowded; the health centre is four miles away; the only water is from a stream up in the hills, a good trek away. Few people in the community are literate. The women say that almost none of them went to school at all when they were children. But the war, and being forced to move, changed their ideas and fired a passion for education, including for their girls. \"The war was senseless and made everyone poorer, but maybe one good thing has come out of it: everyone wants their girls to learn to read,\" one of the village elders says in the unmistakable clipped English of the colonial days. A parents' committee built a school with stones, and wattle cut from the hillside. They dug a latrine and flattened a football pitch. To generate a small income to pay school fees to support the teachers, the men break stones and carry them down to the main road to sell; the women have made little gardens of okra, spinach and peppers which they too sell. One woman, Elizabeth, made soap, until in January last year the rebels entered Freetown and she, like many of the other women in Koya, saw her world collapse a second time. The RUF burned her house, soap-making tools and possessions, and killed her husband. Packed tight into the six classrooms, separated only by open wattle partitions, are 220 children. They do a three-year course; mornings only, so they can work with their families the rest of the day. The goal is that by the fourth year they will be ready to join the formal school system. The sound of class 1's Arabic teacher mingles with class 2's arithmetic and class 3's health education. The six teachers, one a woman, have 10 years' schooling themselves or, in the case of Ahmed, the lead teacher, 12 years. Later this year 16 of their pupils will take the exam for secondary school (though the nearest one is five miles away). The village is prepared to build its own secondary school if necessary. The fever for education is everywhere. \"Since the war rural people came here to Freetown and saw another life,\" says Abraham John, the manager of an adult literacy class in a camp for displaced people on the outskirts of the capital. Across the dusty courtyard of the camp, an old clay factory, Lucy Korwah is teaching a class of 110 displaced children with slates and chalk. She is displaced herself. As she fled through the bush in 1991 she lost two of her children and became separated from her husband. She also lost her sister, and is bringing up three of the sister's children with her own remaining four. There are no intact families here. A third of the children have lost their parents, and among the traumatised children in class there are former RUF child soldiers. Nevertheless, the headteacher, Mariana Kemoh, says with quiet pride that in this primary school for the displaced all those in the top class who sat the national primary school examination passed. Liberia Illiteracy 80% Primary school attendance 59% Below the poverty line 80% Sierra Leone Illiteracy 80% School enrollment (6-14) 45% 300 schools destroyed 10,000 children separated from families 5,000 child combatants",

Mr Krajisnik was seized at his home in Pale, south east of Sarajevo, by French troops before dawn on Monday and sent to the International Criminal Tribunal in the Hague. His indictment, which was drawn up secretly by prosecutors earlier this year, is a major breakthrough since it charges Mr Krajisnik with crimes committed before war broke out in Bosnia in April 1992. It makes it clear that prosecutors believe the ethnic cleansing of Muslims and Croats, as well as the acts of rape and murder that accompanied it, were planned months in advance. They were not atrocities that arose in the passion of war or were carried out by local commanders, but were part of a systematic plan. At the time, Mr Krajisnik was speaker of the Bosnian parliament. Like the big rape trial currently under way in the Hague, all previous prosecutions by the international tribunal have dealt with atrocities committed during the Bosnian war. The dawn arrest is also intriguing because it highlights many of the contradictions in western policy in Bosnia since 1995, when international mediators managed to negotiate an end to the war. Mr Krajisnik was a member of Bosnia's collective presidency after the Bosnian war ended in 1995, and had frequent dealings with international negotiators and the administrators appointed to oversee the Dayton agreement that brought peace to the country. Was Mr Krajisnik's role in 1991 and 1992 really not known to prosecutors until this year? The tribunal's action in arresting him now is also bound to raise questions about its implications for other notable Bosnian Serbs. Two of Mr Krajisnik's closest associates, Radovan Karadzic, the leader of the main Bosnian Serb political party, and General Ratko Mladic, were indicted several years ago, though they have never been arrested. But Mrs Biljana Plavsic, who was one of the two Serb members of Bosnia's collective presidency before the war, and who was strongly supported later by western leaders, has not been indicted - unless she, too, is covered by a secret charge. Paul Risley, the spokesman for the Hague tribunal, said Mr Krajisnik was one of the individuals who ran illegal operations that resulted in the deaths of thousands of Bosnians.

      "body": "<p>Over 23,000 BBC staffers had waited months for the moment this morning when their new director-general revealed his blueprint for the corporation's future. </p> <p>When it came, Greg Dyke's vision of a flatter, less bureaucratic BBC looked for all the world like a rainbow-coloured daisy. </p> <p>Surrounding the DG - or perhaps the stamen - at the centre of the flower are 17 petals, representing the new departments to be created. All of these - from drama, entertainment and children's to distribution and technology - will report directly to Dyke for the first time. There will be a director heading up each petal, most of whom so far are familiar faces, drawn from the existing BBC executives after something of a cabinet reshuffle.</p> <p>Massive new investment will be available to grow these new departments: particularly the key areas of drama, entertainment and sport. An extra \u00a3100m will be found this year to boost programmes and a further \u00a3200m extra next year will enable Dyke to give back some power to BBC 1 and 2, which have for so long struggled on budgets inferior to their rivals. </p> <p>Dyke's overarching ambition, and it's a crowd-pleaser, is to rid the BBC of its wasteful practices and over-managed culture and send the savings back into programmes. No one on the BBC staff can do anything but welcome a change of management culture which has been needed for so long. </p> <p>But scratch the surface and the confusion is far from over for those inside the corporation. Although the top level may now know where they're headed, hundreds of producers, administrators and support staff are today left with absolutely no idea who their boss is, or what their job is. In fact many of the supervisory production roles may disappear over the next few months - at a conservative estimate, the BBC says, several hundred jobs will be lost further down the daisy chain.</p> <p>It will take up to six months for the full effect to be felt. Seasoned BBC observers welcome the changes, but offer words of caution to Dyke, that a BBC in permanent revolution is no different to the BBC Birt left behind. If he really wants to achieve a happy BBC for his staff to work in, he needs to act swiftly, but also to settle with a structure regardless of further developments in technology and the BBC's business, which are inevitable. </p> <p>In the meantime, word from inside Television Centre is that large numbers of BBC staff are staring obsessively at the pastel petals on a piece of paper that represent their future.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Over 23,000 BBC staffers had waited months for the moment this morning when their new director-general revealed his blueprint for the corporation's future. When it came, Greg Dyke's vision of a flatter, less bureaucratic BBC looked for all the world like a rainbow-coloured daisy. Surrounding the DG - or perhaps the stamen - at the centre of the flower are 17 petals, representing the new departments to be created. All of these - from drama, entertainment and children's to distribution and technology - will report directly to Dyke for the first time. There will be a director heading up each petal, most of whom so far are familiar faces, drawn from the existing BBC executives after something of a cabinet reshuffle. Massive new investment will be available to grow these new departments: particularly the key areas of drama, entertainment and sport. An extra \u00a3100m will be found this year to boost programmes and a further \u00a3200m extra next year will enable Dyke to give back some power to BBC 1 and 2, which have for so long struggled on budgets inferior to their rivals. Dyke's overarching ambition, and it's a crowd-pleaser, is to rid the BBC of its wasteful practices and over-managed culture and send the savings back into programmes. No one on the BBC staff can do anything but welcome a change of management culture which has been needed for so long. But scratch the surface and the confusion is far from over for those inside the corporation. Although the top level may now know where they're headed, hundreds of producers, administrators and support staff are today left with absolutely no idea who their boss is, or what their job is. In fact many of the supervisory production roles may disappear over the next few months - at a conservative estimate, the BBC says, several hundred jobs will be lost further down the daisy chain. It will take up to six months for the full effect to be felt. Seasoned BBC observers welcome the changes, but offer words of caution to Dyke, that a BBC in permanent revolution is no different to the BBC Birt left behind. If he really wants to achieve a happy BBC for his staff to work in, he needs to act swiftly, but also to settle with a structure regardless of further developments in technology and the BBC's business, which are inevitable. In the meantime, word from inside Television Centre is that large numbers of BBC staff are staring obsessively at the pastel petals on a piece of paper that represent their future.",

      "bodyText": "What do you drive? A silver Ford Ka. It's bubble shaped, like a spaceship. I suppose that says I like to live in the present and the future but not the past. What do you like - or not like - about it? It's a manual, which I hate. I've only ever driven automatics - lazy I know. The great thing about it is that it can carry a lot of petrol but be economical with it. Why did you buy it? I liked the shape. What kind of driver are you? Fast but safe, though apparently I'm a bit erratic and make my passengers want to throw up. Any bad habits? I forget to put on my seat belt. Any driving test tales? It was so long ago I can barely remember it. I passed second time and it was uneventful. What was your first car? A convertible Golf. Have you ever crashed/got a speeding ticket/got any points? I've had it all: points, tickets and a crash. A truck hit me when pulling out on to a main road. I had to crawl out on the other side but I was OK. What do you use your car for? Everything - work, pleasure, shopping. I couldn't do without it. Have you ever experienced roadrage? No I'm fairly calm. I always give way and let people out. As I'm busy with people all day long driving is my quiet time - my meditation down time. What's in the boot? An umbrella and an anorak that folds into its own bag. Have you ever had sex in a car? No What music do you listen to on the road? Rhythm and blues. Apart from Jazz FM and Classic FM I rarely have radio on because DJs tend to shout and I can't bear to be shouted at while I'm in the car. What would be your dream car? A convertible VW Karman Ghia. But I'd want a brand new one that didn't break down, which is a problem as they don't make them anymore. Who would be your dream passenger? The jazz singer Diane Reeves - she could sing to me while I was driving. I love her soothing tones.

      "body": "<p>It all started with my sister Sarah. She'd grown sick of her ageing Fiat Punto and Henry and George's elbows were growing so fast that whenever the family went out, it was tears before the first lay-by. Sarah's heart was set on a Golf, so she persuaded her husband Gary - because Gary is a bloke - to go with her to the local VW showroom. </p> <p>She took Gary because Sarah is one of the 80% of women who feel they need to enlist the help of a male partner or friend before they are ready to walk through a car showroom door. Many of these suspected that if they bought alone, they may not get a good deal, though the findings, commissioned on behalf of Duckhams, stress that women often lack confidence because generally they have less technical knowledge of cars than men. </p> <p>The salesman who dealt with Sarah and Gary sounds like he was the spit of Swiss Tony from the Fast Show. He asked Gary some questions, then he asked him some more and, while Sarah pogoed up and down in his line of vision, she remained invisible. Yes, the car was for her, but if she'd just keep out of the man's business of negotiating a sale, she'd be doing herself a favour. </p> <p>Half an hour later, they had bought a Mercedes-Benz A class, spending considerably more than they planned to, but Sarah was happy: \"The dealer asked me what I needed and he listened to me.\" And it would have been a he - the latest figures show female sales staff make up just 30% of the 386,000 employed in UK car sales. So even though 42% of cars are bought by women, it's not surprising that many consider forecourts and showrooms to be no-go zones. </p> <p>But is this perception right? To find out, I agreed with What Car? magazine that I would go to 10 dealerships to find out how much of a discount I could get on various new cars. Then What Car? staff reporter Sarah Cutler would go to the same places to see what sort of deal she could get. I said I was a self-employed professional, that I was in a position to pay for the car in full before driving away, but that I'd be interested in any credit schemes if that would mean saving money. Sarah made out that her situation was similar to mine. I visited all dealers before Sarah. </p> <p>First stop was Northfield Audi in Tetbury, and we were after an A3 1.6 SE. The salesman, Richard Friend, was friendly enough but made it clear I would be wasting my time if I tried to haggle and that it would make no difference if I was paying with cash or credit. He did, however, run my details through Audi's Solutions scheme and went to great lengths to explain why I might be better off driving away under the terms of a repayment scheme. He also suggested that the extra for metallic paint would be money well spent when it came to trading the A3 in. There was no car immediately available for test drive, but one could easily be fixed up. </p> <p>When Sarah went along, Richard Friend wasn't around but Malcolm Rance offered similar information. Paying cash or finance would make no difference, and he ran through the computer looking at Audi's Solutions scheme (which he was also enthusiastic about) and again there was no car available right then to test. But she was impressed by the service. No discount for either of us then. </p> <p>Next it was to Dick Lovett in Bristol to buy a BMW 318 SE. Simon Cockram told me that the model I was after was one of the lowest depreciating cars on the market. He said the only discount available was 3%, and that was only given to bulk fleet buyers. He did suggest that a six disc CD changer could be thrown in with the windscreen price. </p> <p>When Sarah went along Simon told her, as he did me, that only fleet buyers get 3% off. But when she said how serious she was, and that she could pay cash, he said he could probably get her that 3% off. There was no mention of a CD player so Sarah lost out to me on that, but her discount was worth \u00a3636. Sarah came away impressed that he'd seemed more keen to sell her a car than he had to me. </p> <p>After a few more visits a pattern started to emerge. Far from being marginalised and undermined, Sarah was doing better than me, coming away from many dealerships with hefty discounts where I'd got just a few quid off. And I'd been thinking that we were going to nail these evil sexists who are obviously lurking behind every yukka plant, waiting to pounce and patronise the poor girl. \"I haven't found any yet!\" she beamed. </p> <p>But then, just when I was thinking it was safe for a woman to walk into a showroom wearing nothing but a bikini and white stilettos, shouting \"Ooh, can anyone help me with this handbag, it's so full of cash?\", a vestige of the past struck. Rudy Paul was the man I'd tipped from our ten incognito visits as the best salesman of them all. He'd gushed so violently about the new Fiat Punto and \u00a3500 cashback deal that I'd virtually paid for one on the spot. I'd hidden my inside knowledge when he explained how good the car was to drive and played idiot when he narrated the best bits of a test drive. I liked him - the guy was a true professional, the right man to do business with. </p> <p>When he saw Sarah, something went wrong: \"I found him totally patronising. I told him which model I wanted but he pushed me to get the 16-valve model as it would perform better. He offered me the in-house deal of \u00a3500 cashback, but whereas he told Simon it was an in-house deal, he made me feel as if he'd cut \u00a3500 off just for me, just like that, no problem. When it came to discussing paint, he said, in light of the \u00a3500 off, he wouldn't throw in metallic paint - but asked me if I wanted to 'come and see the pretty colours'. He's a good salesman - I came away ready to buy a more expensive car than I'd planned. But I felt patronised and pressured, even if he did give me a lot of time.\" </p> <p>I couldn't feel that sorry for her, considering her total saving was so much greater than mine. So was Sarah happy? </p> <p>\"Given that I made far bigger savings than Simon, I'd say yes. There were vestiges of sexism in some places, but I think we have to realise that, as a consumer issue, sexism can come from either sex and can be directed at either.\" </p> <p>All of which made me anxiously search through my notes: of the ten dealers we'd ambushed, two had been women. Had Sarah got a better deal from them? Toyota exec Sharon Cross had offered me zilch off a Yaris 1.0 GLS supermini. Phew, Sarah had done no better. But Vauxhall saleswoman Sarah Cross offered me \u00a3540 off a Corsa 1.2 GLS, while for Sarah she'd coughed up \u00a31020. I felt transactionally abused - and could only agree with What Car?'s verdict on our research: \"If you're a man buying a car, you'd do best to ask a woman to negotiate for you\". &lt;P.The full report is in the May issue of What Car? magazine, on sale from Wednesday</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>Serie A</strong></p> <p>\"This team has great spirit, the kind of character you can't buy in a supermarket,\" said Sven Goran Eriksson yesterday after his Lazio side opened up the race for the Scudetto with a 1-0 win away at Juventus. Diego Simeone's 67th minute header, and the prolonged heroics of 35-year-old stand-in keeper Marco Ballotta, mean that the Rome club are now only three points off Juve at the top of the table with six games to play. </p> <p>Seven points behind the leaders, and scrabbling for the two remaining Champions League places are Internazionale, Parma and Milan. Parma did their prospects no harm at all this weekend with a 1-0 victory over Milan, their fifth win on the trot. Hernan Crespo scored the winner, his 18th of the season, while his rival for the golden boot, 21-goal Andriy Shevchenko, had a goal disallowed for a foul. </p> <p>Milan's defeat means that Internazionale are in third place despite a disappointing 1-1 draw with Reggina. Another goal for Alvaro Recoba, his tenth of the season, was cancelled out nine minutes from time by David Possanzini. Roma remain in sixth place thanks to Hideotoshi Nakata. The Japanese playmaker, whose future at the club is currently the centre of much speculation, scored in their 1-1 draw with Udinese.</p> <p><strong>Leading standings:</strong> Juventus p28, pts 59; Lazio p28 pts 56; Inter p28 pts 49; Milan p28 pts 49; Parma p28 pts49; Roma p28 pts46.</p> <p> <strong>Primera Liga</strong></p> <p>Barcelona kept the heat on Deportivo La Coruna at the top of the table, and sent out a warning to Chelsea, with a 3-0 victory over fellow Champions League contenders Valencia. Despite a slow start, a headed goal from Winston Bogarde and a brace from Patrick Kluivert (his second of the week) was enough to see off Hector Cuper's talented side. Coach Louis Van Gaal said afterwards: \"At the moment we are looking strong, physically and mentally. Other teams appear to be affected by injuries, but we are able to keep on playing the same.\"</p> <p>Van Gaal's remarks could quite easily have been directed at stuttering Real Madrid. Vicente del Bosque's side, who face Manchester United mid-week, have been fielding a hotch-potch side of late and look to be out of the title race after a 1-1 draw with relegation-threatened Real Sociedad. An Oscar De Paula header equalised the returning Savio's early strike and Real had a splendid performance from teenage goalkeeper Iker Casillas to thank for preserving a point at all. </p> <p>Deportivo stay two points clear at the top of the table after a 3-1 win over Sevilla. Two goals from Yugoslavian international Slavisa Jokanovic and a third from free-scoring Dutchman Roy Makaay, his 16th of the season, were enough to see off the bottom club. Also at the bottom, troubled Atletico Madrid lost again, this time at home to Atletico Bilbao. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink scored his customary goal, but the plight of Jesus Gil's club is looking increasingly uncertain as they remain three points clear of safety.</p> <p><strong>Leading standings</strong> Deportivo p31 pts58; Barcelona p31 pts56; Zaragoza p31 pts54; Real Madrid p31 pts50; Alaves p31 pts 50.</p> <p> <strong>Bundesliga</strong></p> <p>In a title race that looks set to go to the wire, Bayer Leverkusen moved two points clear at the top after a 2-1 win over TSV Munich 1860. Leverkusen's pursuit of their first ever Bundesliga title was helped by goals from Paolo Rink and the league's top scorer Ulf Kirsten. Bayern Munich meanwhile could only draw against mid-table Wolfsburg. Carsten Jancker opened the scoring for the Champions, but a goal from Polish international Andrzej Juskowiak meant the game finished all square.</p> <p><strong>Leading standings</strong> Leverkusen p27 pts57; Munich p27 pts55; Hamburg p27 pts51; Werder Bremen p27 pts40.</p>",

Seven points behind the leaders, and scrabbling for the two remaining Champions League places are Internazionale, Parma and Milan. Parma did their prospects no harm at all this weekend with a 1-0 victory over Milan, their fifth win on the trot. Hernan Crespo scored the winner, his 18th of the season, while his rival for the golden boot, 21-goal Andriy Shevchenko, had a goal disallowed for a foul. Milan's defeat means that Internazionale are in third place despite a disappointing 1-1 draw with Reggina. Another goal for Alvaro Recoba, his tenth of the season, was cancelled out nine minutes from time by David Possanzini. Roma remain in sixth place thanks to Hideotoshi Nakata. The Japanese playmaker, whose future at the club is currently the centre of much speculation, scored in their 1-1 draw with Udinese. Leading standings: Juventus p28, pts 59; Lazio p28 pts 56; Inter p28 pts 49; Milan p28 pts 49; Parma p28 pts49; Roma p28 pts46. Primera Liga Barcelona kept the heat on Deportivo La Coruna at the top of the table, and sent out a warning to Chelsea, with a 3-0 victory over fellow Champions League contenders Valencia. Despite a slow start, a headed goal from Winston Bogarde and a brace from Patrick Kluivert (his second of the week) was enough to see off Hector Cuper's talented side. Coach Louis Van Gaal said afterwards: \"At the moment we are looking strong, physically and mentally. Other teams appear to be affected by injuries, but we are able to keep on playing the same.\" Van Gaal's remarks could quite easily have been directed at stuttering Real Madrid. Vicente del Bosque's side, who face Manchester United mid-week, have been fielding a hotch-potch side of late and look to be out of the title race after a 1-1 draw with relegation-threatened Real Sociedad. An Oscar De Paula header equalised the returning Savio's early strike and Real had a splendid performance from teenage goalkeeper Iker Casillas to thank for preserving a point at all. Deportivo stay two points clear at the top of the table after a 3-1 win over Sevilla. Two goals from Yugoslavian international Slavisa Jokanovic and a third from free-scoring Dutchman Roy Makaay, his 16th of the season, were enough to see off the bottom club. Also at the bottom, troubled Atletico Madrid lost again, this time at home to Atletico Bilbao. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink scored his customary goal, but the plight of Jesus Gil's club is looking increasingly uncertain as they remain three points clear of safety. Leading standings Deportivo p31 pts58; Barcelona p31 pts56; Zaragoza p31 pts54; Real Madrid p31 pts50; Alaves p31 pts 50. Bundesliga In a title race that looks set to go to the wire, Bayer Leverkusen moved two points clear at the top after a 2-1 win over TSV Munich 1860. Leverkusen's pursuit of their first ever Bundesliga title was helped by goals from Paolo Rink and the league's top scorer Ulf Kirsten. Bayern Munich meanwhile could only draw against mid-table Wolfsburg. Carsten Jancker opened the scoring for the Champions, but a goal from Polish international Andrzej Juskowiak meant the game finished all square. Leading standings Leverkusen p27 pts57; Munich p27 pts55; Hamburg p27 pts51; Werder Bremen p27 pts40.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Tony Parsons: </strong>Hello, this is Tony Parsons and here I am at the Guardian, ready and willing to talk to you about my novel Man and Boy, or any other stuff you want to discuss. It's a rainy old day, isn't it? Is that coffee for me? Well, thank you. Shall we start? </p> <p> <strong>Mnorth: </strong> In Man and Boy you look back nostalgically to the 'golden age' of traditional parenting and nuclear families. Do you believe, as the government seems to want to teach in schools, that there is an ideal family structure within which to bring up children?</p> <p><strong>TP: </strong>I am not sure if there's an ideal family structure for bringing up children - I think that one good parent is better than two medicore or two lousy parents , but it seems self-evident that two good parents are better than one...I feel that Man And Boy gives the love and respect due to the old nuclear family - the kind of family that I grew up in - while acknowledging that we have to invent new kinds of families for a different age...I know that not all the old nuclear families were happy and strong ...and I'm sure that if you were stuck in an abusive or boring marriage that was going to last for a lifetime, it must have been soul-destroying. But I really did come from a very happy, old-fashioned nuclear family , where man, woman and child were all fairly contented with their lot - and that's certainly reflected in Man And Boy, where Harry yearns for a more simple - and happier - past, while finally learning that we have to invent more fluid family structures for our own age - none of the families that I have lived in since leaving home have resembled the family I grew up in, and I think that's a fairly typical experience for anyone born after the War (World War Two, Falklands, Gulf War, any war). I don't think there's any less love and tenderness in our new kind of families, and I hope that Man And Boy acknowledges that too.</p> <p><strong>Greenday 234: </strong> Which authors inspire you? And (very different question) who do you think you're \"like\"? </p> <p><strong>TP: </strong> I get inspiration wherever I kind find it, although Tobias Wolff was my main man during the writing of Man And Boy because he writes so brilliantly about parents and children.. .and the funny thing is that I only discovered Tobias him because he is next to Tom Wolfe on the bookshelf and Mr Wolfe takes so long to bring his books out.</p> <p><strong>Shem 32: </strong> What do you say to accusations of Nick Hornby-ism?</p> <p><strong>TP: </strong> I haven't really been aware of any accusations of ripping off Nick Hornby, to be honest - I have been aware that the vast majority of reviews were very positive, but there were a few people who hated Man And Boy because - well, I don't know. I feel the people who slagged it off thought it was too emotional or whatever - but I wasn't aware that anyone thought it was lousy because it resembled Nick Hornby. I like Nick Hornby - he is a lovely man and a beautiful writer, but I feel we are writing different kinds of books. One big difference is that I became a father when I was very young, and that experience is certainly reflected in Man And Boy. In a lot of contemporary male fiction, men - even men who are well into their thirties - are not fathers. But my son has been central to my life for 20 years, and that will always be reflected in my stuff. That doesn't mean you have to base everything you write on your life - but you can't erase experience, and parenthood is very much a part of my life.</p> <p><strong>Nsalt: </strong> Have you been inspired or informed by any other writers on the subject of father/parenthood? Or is this a subject which you feel has been unduly neglected in literature?</p> <p><strong>TP: </strong> I do feel that fatherhood has been missing from male fiction - because so many men I know put it off until quite late in life... but that's fine for me and great for Man And Boy, and it's one of the reasons that people have gone for the book in such a big way.</p> <p><strong>Cresswn: </strong> I felt it unrealistic that the main character's wife, who placed so much emphasis on fidelity, should then go off with a married man. Although I accept that these contrasts do appear in life, her statement along the lines of \"if you've done it once, you will do it a thousand times\" seems to suggest that she would never trust such a partner. </p> <p> Ever since I read the book it's something that has troubled me, and I had funnily enough hoped one day to bump into you to ask the question. Can you explain your thoughts on this ? </p> <p> Other than that a great book, which I read in double-quick time. </p> <p><strong>TP: </strong>I know what you're saying about the character of Gina in Man And Boy - but I feel her extreme reaction to Harry's infidelity works. One strike and you're out - I had a girlfriend once who had a background very close to Gina's in the book - that is, her dad ran off to start up a new family when she was very small, and she certainly felt the same way as Gina -- that is, she wanted the man she loved to be better than that, to be better than the regular creep in the street. And when he wasn't - when I wasn't - she was hurt beyond belief, and like Gina in Man And Boy , felt more than betrayed - she felt as if she had been tricked. But anyway - thanks for loving the book, despite your reservations about Gina's attitude to infidelity.</p> <p> <strong>jess75: </strong> Tony - greatly enjoyed Man and Boy. But kept wondering how much was rather closer to your own life than mere fiction. Could you enlighten? </p> <p><strong>TP: </strong>I'm glad you liked the book...with regards to how much is fiction and how much fact, I would draw your attention to a line in a Roddy Doyle book - \"I could make it all up and it would still be true.\" I feel that there's an emotional truth to the book that is greater than any biographical truth - if the book had just been based on my life, it wouldn't have worked, you wouldn't have liked it, and it wouldn't be outselling Harry Potter - I tried to write a book that was not about my life, but about everybody's life - that sounds pretentious, but that's what I wanted to do.There are certainly things in the book that are almost exactly what happened to me - Harry's relationship to his father is very close to my relationship to my dad - but what happens with Harry and his son in Man And Boy is not what happened to my son and I in real life - he (my boy) has read Man And Boy, and is greatly amused by what I have stolen from real life - the child's obsession with Star Wars, his hatred of having his hair washed - but he sees it as a total work of fiction, because what happened in his life is nothing like what happens to the child in the book. His life was tougher.</p> <p><strong>rgsharp: </strong> hi. I thought your portrayal of bitterness - as in the woman-hating lawyer - was really good. Your hero turns out rather saintly - are we to infer that you agree with the traditional tenet that all things being equal, a child should live with its mother? Also wondered if you could comment on the rash of 'city girl' books (concerns: spritzers, shagging) versus the rash of 'male angst' books (concerns: leaving childhood behind, taking responsibility, committing to a monogamous relationship)?</p> <p><strong>TP: </strong> I don't really have any great take on the city girl books - the spritzer and shagging books - because I have only read them when someone paid me to on Late Review. I read Lisa Jewell's Ralph's Party - is that one of them? I suppose it is...I quite liked that one, although not as much as Tom Paulin did - I am against, in principle, fiction that tries to ingratiate itself with one particular market. I like it - love it - that women as well as men have bought Man And Boy.In fact, it's women who have made Man And Boy a bestseller, and almost all the letters I receive about the book come from women. So I think that anything that sets out to be a \"city girl\" book or \"lad lit\" or whatever, will never have a chance of outselling Bridget Jones, John Grisham and Stephen King - which is what Man And Boy is doing, praise the lord...I'm glad you liked the portrait of male bitterness as embodied in Man And Boy's divorce lawyer - I'm not sure I agree that Harry turns out saintly in Man And Boy - although I can understand how you would say that - but I feel that he is a man who learns to be a little bit better than he is at the start of the book - he learns to take care of the things and the people he loves, which is always a lesson worth learning...if I am honest, I would say that - yes, probably the children of divorced parents are usually happier with the mother than the father...but that's not always the case, and I have known some great single parents who were men - I think that we have to consider the possibility of children living with their dads after a divorce - soemtimes it is for the best. Man And Boy is not about the rights of men - it's a book about the rights of children. I think children are the people who get shafted in the modern world, not men or women...</p> <p><strong> KenDavro: </strong> when on late review, have you ever been tempted to tell craig brown to get a more dignified hair cut? </p> <p> <strong> Morcheeba: </strong> On the subject, do you feel upstaged by Tom Paulin? Cos he's the one that most people I know watch it for.</p> <p><strong>TP: </strong> Thanks for your questions about Late Review, KenDavro and Morcheeba - no, I can't say it ever occured to me to tell Craig Brown to get his hair cut - I always thought it was great to have a few delightful eccentrics on the show, and the cut of Craig's jib always gave me a pang in the heart somehow...oh yes, I always felt upstaged by Tom Paulin on Late Review - he's great on TV , Tom, one of the greatest presences on the box we have ever seemed, balanced perfectly between common sense and complete madness - I'm a big fan of Tom Paulin, and envy the effect that he has on women when he flashes his big dreamy eyes. How could I fail to feel upstaged by Tom?</p> <p><strong>Mnorth: </strong> Man and Boy feels, in parts, as if it has been written with an eye on a future film adaptation (cf Hornby's Fever Pitch and High Fidelity). Is this the case, and who would you like to play Harry in a film version?</p> <p><strong>TP: </strong> I have sold Man And Boy to the BBC, where it will be a 2-part series, directed by Simon Curtis, who did that incredible adaption of David Copperfield at Christmas - naturally I always wanted to sell Man And Boy to film or TV, but when you are truly immersed in a book, those thoughts sort of go out the window - you're just too concentrated on getting the book right. As for television's Harry - it has to be Sean Bean, doesn't it? Sean Bean, Sean Bean, Sean Bean - I met him recently, and women seem to like him a lot.In fact, the only other heart throb of that magnitude I have ever met is Tom Paulin. But Tom doesn't have an Equity card... </p> <p><strong>drella23: </strong> If the Kinderbunker were to be rebuilt for a day, and you rejoined the staff of the NME, who would you interview/have on the cover/slag off?</p> <p><strong>TP: </strong> Thanks for your question about the good old days, drella23 - I think that if I rejoined the staff of the NME, the person I would most like to interview is my mum - because I didn't talk to her enough and appreciate her enough and listen to her enough when she was alive.</p> <p><strong>jrkennedy: </strong> Do you read the Guardian? Do you read Julie Burchill's column in Weekend?</p> <p><strong>TP: </strong> I must admit that I am only a sporadic reader of the Guardian...I do love Bel Littlejohn and Mark Lawson and the Media section on Monday, and I like Simon Hattenstone's interviews - in fact, there's a lot about the Guardian that I like, but I can't pretend that I buiy it every morning because I don't. Maybe I should switch over from the Indy. What do you think??</p> <p><strong>pintodesa: </strong> Tony, Harry's relationship with his father is very touching and thought-provoking. Again, how much of this was drawn from your own personal experience with your father?</p> <p><strong>TP: </strong> On paper, it's very close - my dad was a big war hero, a very tough man who was also very gentle - more gentle, in fact, than anyone I have ever met - my dad literally would not hurt a fly - if a lady bird wandered into out house , he would pick it up and carry it out to the garden - he was a tattooed greengrocer with the demeanour of a Buddhist monk - that's all very close to what Harry's dad is like in the book...But it's funny, because when I look at Man And BOy now, it does feel like Harry's dad and my dad are two very different men...it's like trying to paint someone's face from memory - you can never really get it right. Also, I've learned that you can't stop life happening to you. I mean, like Harry's dad in the book, my dad had terminal cancer - but that was 13 years ago. My dad died in 1987.Yet while I was writing Man And Boy, my mother was dying of cancer - she died on 23rd April 1999, almost exactly a year ago, and when I look at Man And Boy, I feel that I have invested a lot of my feelings about my mother into the character of Harry's dad. Does that make sense? A lot of the hospital scenes are very raw because that's what I was going through with my mother. I tried to make Harry's dad a replica of my dad - but the 13 years that had gone by since his death intervened, and made their mark.</p> <p><strong>sgcc2: </strong> why do you think it is that a lot of recent fiction is about how \"difficult\" it is to be \"a man\" or \"a woman\", when novels used to be about ambition and murder and adultery ... why this descent into the mundane?</p> <p> <strong>TP: </strong> Why is so much fiction now about how \"difficult\" it is to be a man or woman? I guess it's because unhappiness is inherently dramatic in a way that happiness is not - and also our gender identities are up for grabs in a way that they haven't been for most of the last century - I would certainly rather read a book about someone's relationship with their parents, children, partner or how we balance the need to build a home with the urge to seek out new partners ....all that good modern stuff...I would rather read all that than some crash-bang-wallop novel - that's what mundane for me. What I like about Elmore Leonard novels, for example, are the dialogue, the characterisation, the plot lines - but Elmore is a genius, and most people who write books featuring guns are not. </p> <p><strong>ejsuth</strong> What do you understand by the term 'new man', and are you one?</p> <p><strong>TP:</strong> Hello ejsuth - yes, \"New Man\" is an interesting one, isn't it? I never really bought it, because I feel that real people don't fit into pigeon holes. It is undeniable that men have changed - for example, my father could never have brought me up alone, if he had split from my mother. It just wouldn't have happened. But now a man bringing up his kids alone is nothing very special. I always felt that the reason I get so much stick from all the 70s feminists - Joan Smith, Linda Grant, Lisa Jardine, all that lot - is because I disappointed them, because in many ways I was what the new, feminist-approved man should be - capable of bringing up a small child alone, capable of putting my child before anything else in this world - but at the same time I looked a bit of a lad. Do you know what I mean? Here comes a new breed of man - and yet he still likes football, martial arts and women. I was alone with my son from the summer of 1984 - if anyone should have been a New Man, it was me. And yet I never was - because the New Man doesn't exist. Yet men have changed and will continue to change - trite labels will only obscure that fact. Thanks for your question...</p> <p><strong>pintodesa</strong> Do you think your own life story would make a good book, and if so how much of it has already been included in Man and Boy? </p> <p> <strong>TP:</strong> Dear pintodesa - hello to you too - I think that maybe one day my life would fit into a book - it would be very different from Man And Boy, which takes place over the course of a year - but I would like to do it when I was ready to fall off my perch, and I would like to do it with a lot of generosity and love - something like David Niven's memoirs. I wouldn't do it to get even with people or reveal the sordid truth etc etc. There's no need. My life is all the revenge I ever need. So - one day, darling....</p> <p><strong>Meatloaf</strong> I played football with Steven Wells of NME yesterday. Has he always been that annoying? </p> <p><strong>TP:</strong> Dear Meatloaf, Thanks for your question about Steven Wells and the NME - I don't really remember him, to be honest, so I can't tell you if he has changed. I don't think he was there at the same time as me. I remember Nick Kent and Charles Shaar Murray, and I remember my little heart beating with excitement inside my leather jacket at being in the same office as these guys - I remember them very clearly, because I loved their writing so much, so it was a great honour to be around them and share the odd Tizer. But it's going back a long way - almost a quarter of a century...so I don't remember that much.</p> <p> <strong> KenDavro</strong> were you this polite when you were interviewing punk bands, or did you have to come across a bit hard? </p> <p> <strong>TP:</strong> Dear KenDavro - thanks for your question. Well, I was brought up to be polite to everyone I meet, and I try to honour that - I certainly never had to pretend to be hard with punk bands, because I knew for certain that I was infinitely harder than all of them - I could afford to be polite, because if it came to a scrap, they would have been mincemeat. Especially that Sid Vicious , who only ever hit women and junkies. See, I grew up around a genuine hard man- my dad. So art school counterfeits never made me go ooh-ahh. I was polite to them - just as I am polite to everyone - unless I am given a reason to be impolite. But I don't go around trying to make enemies.You have to choose to be my enemy. Otherwise, I am full of love and good will... </p> <p><strong>ollywicken</strong> what's your next book about? </p> <p> <strong>TP:</strong> Dear ollywicken - hello. I think the next book will be more of the same - more stories of sex, love and death. More stories of parents and children - more 3-hankie, 3-generation conflict, although the focus is going to be national identity more than masculine identity...but it's going to have Man And Boy in its shadow, and that makes me nervous - not because I fear that the next book will be less successful, but just because you don't want to disappoint anyone. I am aware that people love Man And Boy - not everyone, of course, because that would be impossible. But the people who like it seem to like it a lot. That's what a writer dreams of, naturally, but there's always the nagging fear that this could be it - the high point of your career. I certainly feel that it will be really difficult to top Man And Boy - in terms of sales, critical response, the lot. So I am writing the next book wanting it and needing it to be accepted by the people who love Man And Boy. That's not easy - there are two ways you can go.You can write something completely different - as Alex Garland did with The Tesseract after The Beach, or you can write essentially the same thing - as Richard Curtis did with Notting Hill after Four Weddings And A Funeral. Neither of those options are completely satisfactory - so I am looking for The Third Way : a book that the people who love Man And Boy will love, but something that stands in its own right.</p> <p> <strong>ollywicken</strong> Red sports car fantasy. Petite blonde wife. Child's injury provoking a change of attitude from the father. Love for father unspoken until his death....all well-trodden ground, surely. For me, the most interesting development was Harry's realisation that his trying to be a New Dad was just another form of selfishness - designed to make himself feel good rather than actually help his son. Yet you used this only as a plot twist. I was surprised you didn't explore this further. Why not? Why did you hurry past it? </p> <p><strong>TP:</strong> Dear ollywicken, I know what you mean about Harry realising that his attitude to fatherhood is essentially selfish rather than selfless - but I didn't feel I needed to explore the issue further than I did, because I always wanted Man And Boy to carry its implications lightly. I didn't want to lecture because I felt there's no need. It's not about being a New Dad - it's about learning the difference between real love and some lesser form of love. It's about knowing - really knowing - that love is selfless. If you love someone for what's in it for you, that's not the real thing. You've got the red sports car bit right - but Gina is not petite!! Gina is a big girl, man!! Reread your Man And Boy, because if you think Gina is petite, you are missing the author's message!! I can appreciate that you think Harry's midlife crisis symptoms are cliches - red sports car, young researcher, awareness of parental mortality , etc - but that's what life is like, isn't it?? Men don't reach 30, 40 or 50 and dream of getting a Volvo estate - do they?? What I like about Harry is that he is always aware when he is doing something - lusting after an MGF, having a one night stand with someone from work - that many other lost souls have done before him.</p> <p><strong>pintodesa </strong> Never mind about Sean Bean playing Harry. Who would play you in 'Tony Parsons: the movie'? </p> <p><strong>TP:</strong> Hello again, Pintodesa...thanks for the question about who would play me in the TV movie of my life - have you seen Rogue Trader?? Ewan Macgegor does a really good Essex accent - he's right on the money. Okay, he's a bit uglier than me, but I think this tradition of authors always being played by actors who are infinitely better looking than they are is becoming a bit trite. Also, it would really impress my son if I could introduce him to the actor who plays the young Obi-Wan Kenobi. So it has to be Ewan Macgregor - who I wouldn't mind for Harry in the BBC adaption of Man And Boy, if Sean Bean is unavailable...</p> <p><strong>Morcheeba </strong> I read something about how you now do martial arts and your hands are lethal weapons. Who would get the treatment if you could get away with it?</p> <p><strong>TP:</strong> Dear Morcheeba, No my hands are not lethal weapons...I do Kung Fu but I am still a very small Grasshopper...I have a teacher, David Courtney Jones, whose hands are quite possible lethal weapons. Certainly his feet are - he kicked me across a room once, and it was almost a pleasure to be on the end of a kick like that - almost a pleasure, but not quite. I think the more you do martial arts, the more you realise your limitations - maybe it's a lot like learning a language - you soon learn that there's an entire universe beyond the plume de ma tante. So I am very humble about my fighting ability.I like to think that my mind is a lethal weapon...</p> <p><strong>Meatloaf </strong> How many people have actually read this Man and Boy thing? (quick show of hands)</p> <p><strong>TP:</strong> Dear Meatloaf, I don't know how mnay people have read Man And Boy - the book is selling around 11,000 paperbacks a week, but it has only been out for a little under a month. The hardback did 25,000 , which is pretty good, but of course a sold book doesn't mean one eader - I'm always surprised how many people have read Man And Boy. I guess that's when you know you have a bestseller. Certainly the book is doing good business - it is currently number two in the Bookseller list of bestsellers, with only Catherine Cookson (curse her!) above it. In the Sunday Times list yesterday, it was at number 4 behind Cookson, Lyn Andrews (another romantic novelist who sells by the bucket in supermarkets) and The Beach film tie-in - number four in the Sunday Times is down one place from last week, but with sales remaining steady. So it's exciting - having a bestseller is something that I can heartily recommend - you wake up in the middle of the night thinking, yes!! I'm on top of Jeffrey Archer!! Something only a few thousand people have ever been able to say...</p> <p><strong>TP:</strong> Okay, it's 4.35 and time for me to go - thanks for your questions, and thank you for buying Man And Boy - this whole thing has been much more fun than I expected. Thank you and goodbye, Love, Tony Parsons xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p>",

But I really did come from a very happy, old-fashioned nuclear family , where man, woman and child were all fairly contented with their lot - and that's certainly reflected in Man And Boy, where Harry yearns for a more simple - and happier - past, while finally learning that we have to invent more fluid family structures for our own age - none of the families that I have lived in since leaving home have resembled the family I grew up in, and I think that's a fairly typical experience for anyone born after the War (World War Two, Falklands, Gulf War, any war). I don't think there's any less love and tenderness in our new kind of families, and I hope that Man And Boy acknowledges that too. Greenday 234: Which authors inspire you? And (very different question) who do you think you're \"like\"? TP: I get inspiration wherever I kind find it, although Tobias Wolff was my main man during the writing of Man And Boy because he writes so brilliantly about parents and children.. .and the funny thing is that I only discovered Tobias him because he is next to Tom Wolfe on the bookshelf and Mr Wolfe takes so long to bring his books out. Shem 32: What do you say to accusations of Nick Hornby-ism? TP: I haven't really been aware of any accusations of ripping off Nick Hornby, to be honest - I have been aware that the vast majority of reviews were very positive, but there were a few people who hated Man And Boy because - well, I don't know. I feel the people who slagged it off thought it was too emotional or whatever - but I wasn't aware that anyone thought it was lousy because it resembled Nick Hornby. I like Nick Hornby - he is a lovely man and a beautiful writer, but I feel we are writing different kinds of books. One big difference is that I became a father when I was very young, and that experience is certainly reflected in Man And Boy. In a lot of contemporary male fiction, men - even men who are well into their thirties - are not fathers. But my son has been central to my life for 20 years, and that will always be reflected in my stuff. That doesn't mean you have to base everything you write on your life - but you can't erase experience, and parenthood is very much a part of my life. Nsalt: Have you been inspired or informed by any other writers on the subject of father/parenthood? Or is this a subject which you feel has been unduly neglected in literature? TP: I do feel that fatherhood has been missing from male fiction - because so many men I know put it off until quite late in life... but that's fine for me and great for Man And Boy, and it's one of the reasons that people have gone for the book in such a big way. Cresswn: I felt it unrealistic that the main character's wife, who placed so much emphasis on fidelity, should then go off with a married man. Although I accept that these contrasts do appear in life, her statement along the lines of \"if you've done it once, you will do it a thousand times\" seems to suggest that she would never trust such a partner. Ever since I read the book it's something that has troubled me, and I had funnily enough hoped one day to bump into you to ask the question. Can you explain your thoughts on this ? Other than that a great book, which I read in double-quick time. TP: I know what you're saying about the character of Gina in Man And Boy - but I feel her extreme reaction to Harry's infidelity works. One strike and you're out - I had a girlfriend once who had a background very close to Gina's in the book - that is, her dad ran off to start up a new family when she was very small, and she certainly felt the same way as Gina -- that is, she wanted the man she loved to be better than that, to be better than the regular creep in the street. And when he wasn't - when I wasn't - she was hurt beyond belief, and like Gina in Man And Boy , felt more than betrayed - she felt as if she had been tricked. But anyway - thanks for loving the book, despite your reservations about Gina's attitude to infidelity. jess75: Tony - greatly enjoyed Man and Boy. But kept wondering how much was rather closer to your own life than mere fiction. Could you enlighten? TP: I'm glad you liked the book...with regards to how much is fiction and how much fact, I would draw your attention to a line in a Roddy Doyle book - \"I could make it all up and it would still be true.\" I feel that there's an emotional truth to the book that is greater than any biographical truth - if the book had just been based on my life, it wouldn't have worked, you wouldn't have liked it, and it wouldn't be outselling Harry Potter - I tried to write a book that was not about my life, but about everybody's life - that sounds pretentious, but that's what I wanted to do.There are certainly things in the book that are almost exactly what happened to me - Harry's relationship to his father is very close to my relationship to my dad - but what happens with Harry and his son in Man And Boy is not what happened to my son and I in real life - he (my boy) has read Man And Boy, and is greatly amused by what I have stolen from real life - the child's obsession with Star Wars, his hatred of having his hair washed - but he sees it as a total work of fiction, because what happened in his life is nothing like what happens to the child in the book. His life was tougher. rgsharp: hi. I thought your portrayal of bitterness - as in the woman-hating lawyer - was really good. Your hero turns out rather saintly - are we to infer that you agree with the traditional tenet that all things being equal, a child should live with its mother? Also wondered if you could comment on the rash of 'city girl' books (concerns: spritzers, shagging) versus the rash of 'male angst' books (concerns: leaving childhood behind, taking responsibility, committing to a monogamous relationship)? TP: I don't really have any great take on the city girl books - the spritzer and shagging books - because I have only read them when someone paid me to on Late Review. I read Lisa Jewell's Ralph's Party - is that one of them? I suppose it is...I quite liked that one, although not as much as Tom Paulin did - I am against, in principle, fiction that tries to ingratiate itself with one particular market. I like it - love it - that women as well as men have bought Man And Boy.In fact, it's women who have made Man And Boy a bestseller, and almost all the letters I receive about the book come from women. So I think that anything that sets out to be a \"city girl\" book or \"lad lit\" or whatever, will never have a chance of outselling Bridget Jones, John Grisham and Stephen King - which is what Man And Boy is doing, praise the lord...I'm glad you liked the portrait of male bitterness as embodied in Man And Boy's divorce lawyer - I'm not sure I agree that Harry turns out saintly in Man And Boy - although I can understand how you would say that - but I feel that he is a man who learns to be a little bit better than he is at the start of the book - he learns to take care of the things and the people he loves, which is always a lesson worth learning...if I am honest, I would say that - yes, probably the children of divorced parents are usually happier with the mother than the father...but that's not always the case, and I have known some great single parents who were men - I think that we have to consider the possibility of children living with their dads after a divorce - soemtimes it is for the best. Man And Boy is not about the rights of men - it's a book about the rights of children. I think children are the people who get shafted in the modern world, not men or women... KenDavro: when on late review, have you ever been tempted to tell craig brown to get a more dignified hair cut? Morcheeba: On the subject, do you feel upstaged by Tom Paulin? Cos he's the one that most people I know watch it for. TP: Thanks for your questions about Late Review, KenDavro and Morcheeba - no, I can't say it ever occured to me to tell Craig Brown to get his hair cut - I always thought it was great to have a few delightful eccentrics on the show, and the cut of Craig's jib always gave me a pang in the heart somehow...oh yes, I always felt upstaged by Tom Paulin on Late Review - he's great on TV , Tom, one of the greatest presences on the box we have ever seemed, balanced perfectly between common sense and complete madness - I'm a big fan of Tom Paulin, and envy the effect that he has on women when he flashes his big dreamy eyes. How could I fail to feel upstaged by Tom? Mnorth: Man and Boy feels, in parts, as if it has been written with an eye on a future film adaptation (cf Hornby's Fever Pitch and High Fidelity). Is this the case, and who would you like to play Harry in a film version? TP: I have sold Man And Boy to the BBC, where it will be a 2-part series, directed by Simon Curtis, who did that incredible adaption of David Copperfield at Christmas - naturally I always wanted to sell Man And Boy to film or TV, but when you are truly immersed in a book, those thoughts sort of go out the window - you're just too concentrated on getting the book right. As for television's Harry - it has to be Sean Bean, doesn't it? Sean Bean, Sean Bean, Sean Bean - I met him recently, and women seem to like him a lot.In fact, the only other heart throb of that magnitude I have ever met is Tom Paulin. But Tom doesn't have an Equity card... drella23: If the Kinderbunker were to be rebuilt for a day, and you rejoined the staff of the NME, who would you interview/have on the cover/slag off? TP: Thanks for your question about the good old days, drella23 - I think that if I rejoined the staff of the NME, the person I would most like to interview is my mum - because I didn't talk to her enough and appreciate her enough and listen to her enough when she was alive. jrkennedy: Do you read the Guardian? Do you read Julie Burchill's column in Weekend? TP: I must admit that I am only a sporadic reader of the Guardian...I do love Bel Littlejohn and Mark Lawson and the Media section on Monday, and I like Simon Hattenstone's interviews - in fact, there's a lot about the Guardian that I like, but I can't pretend that I buiy it every morning because I don't. Maybe I should switch over from the Indy. What do you think?? pintodesa: Tony, Harry's relationship with his father is very touching and thought-provoking. Again, how much of this was drawn from your own personal experience with your father? TP: On paper, it's very close - my dad was a big war hero, a very tough man who was also very gentle - more gentle, in fact, than anyone I have ever met - my dad literally would not hurt a fly - if a lady bird wandered into out house , he would pick it up and carry it out to the garden - he was a tattooed greengrocer with the demeanour of a Buddhist monk - that's all very close to what Harry's dad is like in the book...But it's funny, because when I look at Man And BOy now, it does feel like Harry's dad and my dad are two very different men...it's like trying to paint someone's face from memory - you can never really get it right. Also, I've learned that you can't stop life happening to you. I mean, like Harry's dad in the book, my dad had terminal cancer - but that was 13 years ago. My dad died in 1987.Yet while I was writing Man And Boy, my mother was dying of cancer - she died on 23rd April 1999, almost exactly a year ago, and when I look at Man And Boy, I feel that I have invested a lot of my feelings about my mother into the character of Harry's dad. Does that make sense? A lot of the hospital scenes are very raw because that's what I was going through with my mother. I tried to make Harry's dad a replica of my dad - but the 13 years that had gone by since his death intervened, and made their mark. sgcc2: why do you think it is that a lot of recent fiction is about how \"difficult\" it is to be \"a man\" or \"a woman\", when novels used to be about ambition and murder and adultery ... why this descent into the mundane? TP: Why is so much fiction now about how \"difficult\" it is to be a man or woman? I guess it's because unhappiness is inherently dramatic in a way that happiness is not - and also our gender identities are up for grabs in a way that they haven't been for most of the last century - I would certainly rather read a book about someone's relationship with their parents, children, partner or how we balance the need to build a home with the urge to seek out new partners ....all that good modern stuff...I would rather read all that than some crash-bang-wallop novel - that's what mundane for me. What I like about Elmore Leonard novels, for example, are the dialogue, the characterisation, the plot lines - but Elmore is a genius, and most people who write books featuring guns are not. ejsuth What do you understand by the term 'new man', and are you one? TP: Hello ejsuth - yes, \"New Man\" is an interesting one, isn't it? I never really bought it, because I feel that real people don't fit into pigeon holes. It is undeniable that men have changed - for example, my father could never have brought me up alone, if he had split from my mother. It just wouldn't have happened. But now a man bringing up his kids alone is nothing very special. I always felt that the reason I get so much stick from all the 70s feminists - Joan Smith, Linda Grant, Lisa Jardine, all that lot - is because I disappointed them, because in many ways I was what the new, feminist-approved man should be - capable of bringing up a small child alone, capable of putting my child before anything else in this world - but at the same time I looked a bit of a lad. Do you know what I mean? Here comes a new breed of man - and yet he still likes football, martial arts and women. I was alone with my son from the summer of 1984 - if anyone should have been a New Man, it was me. And yet I never was - because the New Man doesn't exist. Yet men have changed and will continue to change - trite labels will only obscure that fact. Thanks for your question... pintodesa Do you think your own life story would make a good book, and if so how much of it has already been included in Man and Boy? TP: Dear pintodesa - hello to you too - I think that maybe one day my life would fit into a book - it would be very different from Man And Boy, which takes place over the course of a year - but I would like to do it when I was ready to fall off my perch, and I would like to do it with a lot of generosity and love - something like David Niven's memoirs. I wouldn't do it to get even with people or reveal the sordid truth etc etc. There's no need. My life is all the revenge I ever need. So - one day, darling.... Meatloaf I played football with Steven Wells of NME yesterday. Has he always been that annoying? TP: Dear Meatloaf, Thanks for your question about Steven Wells and the NME - I don't really remember him, to be honest, so I can't tell you if he has changed. I don't think he was there at the same time as me. I remember Nick Kent and Charles Shaar Murray, and I remember my little heart beating with excitement inside my leather jacket at being in the same office as these guys - I remember them very clearly, because I loved their writing so much, so it was a great honour to be around them and share the odd Tizer. But it's going back a long way - almost a quarter of a century...so I don't remember that much. KenDavro were you this polite when you were interviewing punk bands, or did you have to come across a bit hard? TP: Dear KenDavro - thanks for your question. Well, I was brought up to be polite to everyone I meet, and I try to honour that - I certainly never had to pretend to be hard with punk bands, because I knew for certain that I was infinitely harder than all of them - I could afford to be polite, because if it came to a scrap, they would have been mincemeat. Especially that Sid Vicious , who only ever hit women and junkies. See, I grew up around a genuine hard man- my dad. So art school counterfeits never made me go ooh-ahh. I was polite to them - just as I am polite to everyone - unless I am given a reason to be impolite. But I don't go around trying to make enemies.You have to choose to be my enemy. Otherwise, I am full of love and good will... ollywicken what's your next book about? TP: Dear ollywicken - hello. I think the next book will be more of the same - more stories of sex, love and death. More stories of parents and children - more 3-hankie, 3-generation conflict, although the focus is going to be national identity more than masculine identity...but it's going to have Man And Boy in its shadow, and that makes me nervous - not because I fear that the next book will be less successful, but just because you don't want to disappoint anyone. I am aware that people love Man And Boy - not everyone, of course, because that would be impossible. But the people who like it seem to like it a lot. That's what a writer dreams of, naturally, but there's always the nagging fear that this could be it - the high point of your career. I certainly feel that it will be really difficult to top Man And Boy - in terms of sales, critical response, the lot. So I am writing the next book wanting it and needing it to be accepted by the people who love Man And Boy. That's not easy - there are two ways you can go.You can write something completely different - as Alex Garland did with The Tesseract after The Beach, or you can write essentially the same thing - as Richard Curtis did with Notting Hill after Four Weddings And A Funeral. Neither of those options are completely satisfactory - so I am looking for The Third Way : a book that the people who love Man And Boy will love, but something that stands in its own right. ollywicken Red sports car fantasy. Petite blonde wife. Child's injury provoking a change of attitude from the father. Love for father unspoken until his death....all well-trodden ground, surely. For me, the most interesting development was Harry's realisation that his trying to be a New Dad was just another form of selfishness - designed to make himself feel good rather than actually help his son. Yet you used this only as a plot twist. I was surprised you didn't explore this further. Why not? Why did you hurry past it? TP: Dear ollywicken, I know what you mean about Harry realising that his attitude to fatherhood is essentially selfish rather than selfless - but I didn't feel I needed to explore the issue further than I did, because I always wanted Man And Boy to carry its implications lightly. I didn't want to lecture because I felt there's no need. It's not about being a New Dad - it's about learning the difference between real love and some lesser form of love. It's about knowing - really knowing - that love is selfless. If you love someone for what's in it for you, that's not the real thing. You've got the red sports car bit right - but Gina is not petite!! Gina is a big girl, man!! Reread your Man And Boy, because if you think Gina is petite, you are missing the author's message!! I can appreciate that you think Harry's midlife crisis symptoms are cliches - red sports car, young researcher, awareness of parental mortality , etc - but that's what life is like, isn't it?? Men don't reach 30, 40 or 50 and dream of getting a Volvo estate - do they?? What I like about Harry is that he is always aware when he is doing something - lusting after an MGF, having a one night stand with someone from work - that many other lost souls have done before him. pintodesa Never mind about Sean Bean playing Harry. Who would play you in 'Tony Parsons: the movie'? TP: Hello again, Pintodesa...thanks for the question about who would play me in the TV movie of my life - have you seen Rogue Trader?? Ewan Macgegor does a really good Essex accent - he's right on the money. Okay, he's a bit uglier than me, but I think this tradition of authors always being played by actors who are infinitely better looking than they are is becoming a bit trite. Also, it would really impress my son if I could introduce him to the actor who plays the young Obi-Wan Kenobi. So it has to be Ewan Macgregor - who I wouldn't mind for Harry in the BBC adaption of Man And Boy, if Sean Bean is unavailable... Morcheeba I read something about how you now do martial arts and your hands are lethal weapons. Who would get the treatment if you could get away with it? TP: Dear Morcheeba, No my hands are not lethal weapons...I do Kung Fu but I am still a very small Grasshopper...I have a teacher, David Courtney Jones, whose hands are quite possible lethal weapons. Certainly his feet are - he kicked me across a room once, and it was almost a pleasure to be on the end of a kick like that - almost a pleasure, but not quite. I think the more you do martial arts, the more you realise your limitations - maybe it's a lot like learning a language - you soon learn that there's an entire universe beyond the plume de ma tante. So I am very humble about my fighting ability.I like to think that my mind is a lethal weapon... Meatloaf How many people have actually read this Man and Boy thing? (quick show of hands) TP: Dear Meatloaf, I don't know how mnay people have read Man And Boy - the book is selling around 11,000 paperbacks a week, but it has only been out for a little under a month. The hardback did 25,000 , which is pretty good, but of course a sold book doesn't mean one eader - I'm always surprised how many people have read Man And Boy. I guess that's when you know you have a bestseller. Certainly the book is doing good business - it is currently number two in the Bookseller list of bestsellers, with only Catherine Cookson (curse her!) above it. In the Sunday Times list yesterday, it was at number 4 behind Cookson, Lyn Andrews (another romantic novelist who sells by the bucket in supermarkets) and The Beach film tie-in - number four in the Sunday Times is down one place from last week, but with sales remaining steady. So it's exciting - having a bestseller is something that I can heartily recommend - you wake up in the middle of the night thinking, yes!! I'm on top of Jeffrey Archer!! Something only a few thousand people have ever been able to say... TP: Okay, it's 4.35 and time for me to go - thanks for your questions, and thank you for buying Man And Boy - this whole thing has been much more fun than I expected. Thank you and goodbye, Love, Tony Parsons xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",

He may be flying home from Florida in order to enjoy the pleasure of occasionally irritating the prime minister. That is, I agree, a worthwhile activity. But believe me there are more pleasant ways of doing it than listening to speeches by Lady Young and Baroness Blatch and then voting for a change in legislation in the certain knowledge that, in a week or two, elected members of parliament will change it back into the form which they originally intended. There is also the possibility that - recognising the state opening of parliament as the one opportunity which Lady Ashcroft will ever have to wear a tiara and full evening dress at 11 o'clock in the morning - he regards a peerage as the best way to get more use out of expensive gear. That is the excuse I always gave for the soi-disant radicals who dress up for the occasion in borrowed or hired robes. As you can see, I am running out of plausible explanations for Mr (or is it already Lord?) Ashcroft's passion. Indeed, there is only one left. I suspect that he simply likes the idea of being called \"Lord\" instead of \"Mr\". What a pity that only generals who have won battles on foreign soil can take their titles from exotic lands. Lord Miami Beach would be just right for the latest recruit to the Upper House of Parliament.",

His main evidence for this is to be found, he said, in articles by Christopher Morgan, the royal and religious affairs correspondent. Morgan's stories revealing the drug-taking habits of Prince William's friends, he suggests, show that the paper is pursuing a tabloid agenda since the public interest is marginal. </p> <p>It must be obvious that exposing anyone who may be a dubious influence on the future king is clearly in the public interest. This is not a tabloid agenda; it is good journalism, as the rest of Fleet Street acknowledged when Morgan was shortlisted as specialist of the year in last month's British Press Awards. </p> <p>Much more serious is Roy's contention - based on the unattributed remarks of three former employees - that the news desk \"invents\" stories and instructs reporters to find the \"facts\" to fit them. Leaving aside the axes that these former employees may have to grind, Roy's reasoning is flawed. </p> <p>What he seems to have forgotten is that Sunday newspapers are about setting the agenda. Any Sunday news desk worth its salt has one objective in mind: to generate scoops. But scoops may take numerous forms and can be dug out by different means. There is the scoop of the political reporter or specialist correspondent - a confidential document or contact providing a tip; there's the investigative scoop won by sheer hard work; and there's the flash-of-inspiration scoop, largely the preserve of the news desk. </p> <p>It is this kind of scoop that Roy mistakes for the product of invention. It is more about a news editor, drawing on his or her instincts and experience, suggesting to reporters that they pursue a particular line of inquiry which should reap rewards. </p> <p>The notion that reporters are somehow forced to write stories against their will is clearly absurd. No Fleet Street hack and certainly no Sunday Times journalist would agree to put their byline on a story they did not believe in. Above all, the idea that facts are made to fit predetermined stories just does not hold water. The Sunday Times has never published anything that its executives or reporters have known to be wrong beforehand. Of course, mistakes are made, but these are rare, and speedily put right in the corrections column. </p> <p>Roy likes to imply he presided over a \"golden age\" of news coverage. The truth is, the golden age is now. The Sunday Times has been at the forefront of the Rip-off Britain campaign, one of the most successful campaigns the paper has ever run. Its Kosovo coverage won the BPA team of the year award. This year alone, the paper has broken stories on Greg Dyke's \u00a36m Granada share-holding, Geoffrey Robinson's alleged abuse of DTI grants and details of a secret MI6 document on a plot to kill Gadafy. Only last weekend it published an in-depth investigation into the commercial dealings of former EU commissioners which has made waves across Europe. Hardly the stuff of tabloid journalism. </p> <p>Contrary to Roy's opinion, the Sunday Times has maintained its investigative traditions, deepened and broadened its front section coverage so that \"news\" no longer tails off after page one, and made the paper more relevant to people's lives. It has a sense of humour that was sorely lacking years ago. Above all, its strength lies in its consistency; we may not always have the best scoop of the week, but we will never tolerate a bad paper. How many of our rivals claim as much? </p> <p>\u0095 Mark Skipworth is managing editor (news) of the Sunday Times</p>",

No Fleet Street hack and certainly no Sunday Times journalist would agree to put their byline on a story they did not believe in. Above all, the idea that facts are made to fit predetermined stories just does not hold water. The Sunday Times has never published anything that its executives or reporters have known to be wrong beforehand. Of course, mistakes are made, but these are rare, and speedily put right in the corrections column. Roy likes to imply he presided over a \"golden age\" of news coverage. The truth is, the golden age is now. The Sunday Times has been at the forefront of the Rip-off Britain campaign, one of the most successful campaigns the paper has ever run. Its Kosovo coverage won the BPA team of the year award. This year alone, the paper has broken stories on Greg Dyke's \u00a36m Granada share-holding, Geoffrey Robinson's alleged abuse of DTI grants and details of a secret MI6 document on a plot to kill Gadafy. Only last weekend it published an in-depth investigation into the commercial dealings of former EU commissioners which has made waves across Europe. Hardly the stuff of tabloid journalism. Contrary to Roy's opinion, the Sunday Times has maintained its investigative traditions, deepened and broadened its front section coverage so that \"news\" no longer tails off after page one, and made the paper more relevant to people's lives. It has a sense of humour that was sorely lacking years ago. Above all, its strength lies in its consistency; we may not always have the best scoop of the week, but we will never tolerate a bad paper. How many of our rivals claim as much? \u0095 Mark Skipworth is managing editor (news) of the Sunday Times",

      "trailText": "<p>Greg Dyke today unveils his new BBC, and his de facto deputy.  Maggie Brown and  Janine Gibson uncover Mark Thompson, a man who would have made it under any regime, and how to survive the shake-up</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It was an otherwise unremarkable September afternoon at the 1997 Royal Television Society convention in Cambridge when Mark Thompson's career was made. All the biggest names in broadcasting were gathered, the BBC's digital plans had been unveiled by John Birt and the hushed assembly waited to hear from one of the corporation's biggest names, Alan Yentob. </p> <p>But Yentob had broken a tooth on an unscheduled toffee, so instead it was the relatively junior exec Mark Thompson who stepped up to speak, unscripted, about the essence of BBC values. Looking as if he'd stepped out of an M&amp;S catalogue in a sludge-green pullover, boyishly disarming, he could have been a disaster. Yet he suddenly spoke from the heart, about what the BBC meant to him, of how its programmes were crafted with pride - he compared them to home-made, carefully prepared food. </p> <p>It was oddly touching and effective, distinctive in a sea of self-serving guff. Greg Dyke, then chief executive of Pearson Television, was in the audience and he was impressed. It was the first time he met Thompson and he thought anyone who could get up on stage with 10 minute's warning and speak so eloquently and effectively was worth noticing. Today, Thompson is handed a beefed-up version of Yentob's job as Dyke's de facto deputy. On such moments careers hang. You need luck, yes. But courage too. </p> <p>Thompson's amazing skill is to have succeeded under Birt, but to have emerged this week as the confidant to the anti-establishment outsider Dyke, becoming overseer of BBC1 and BBC2 and replacing Alan Yentob as the embodiment of BBC values. </p> <p>Dyke will announce today that he is diverting an extra \u00a3200m into programming from April 2001. That money is aimed at boosting the core services, especially BBC1, through his plans to create a commercially led BBC film operation unit and heavy investment in drama. Those initiatives will, through Yentob, feed through to the main channels, but the extra cash - found through cutbacks in expenditure - will enable Thompson to channel funds where they're needed, to the controllers and the commissioners. He will actually have the control. </p> <p>So Thompson takes yet another glittering prize, and picks up the mantle of heir apparent - assuming power without appearing to snatch it, or threaten anyone. </p> <p>Old BBC hands are quick to point out that he is a classic BBC man, straight out of the Alasdair Milne school of \"brahmins\" and would have prospered under any regime. \"He reminds me of the old BBC, the people who were brilliant at the politics, very intelligent, but bland,\" says a contemporary. Aged 42, he is tall - six foot three - white, upper middle class. In these rough and ready days of portable careers, short-term contracts and dot.com floats he's a bit of a throwback - having only ever worked for the BBC. Educated at public school - Stonyhurst, the Lancashire Catholic college - and Merton College, Oxford, he edited Isis and took a first in English literature. </p> <p>Then it was straight to the corporation in 1979 on a coveted production traineeship. He did stints on Watchdog and the launch of BBC Breakfast News in 1982, then went to America before joining Newsnight. So far, so establishment for a super-bright young man. </p> <p>In 1988, John Birt, as incoming deputy director-general, chose him to be editor of the Nine O'Clock News. Thompson was 30. Then two years later he was dispatched to run another Birtist priority, Panorama. </p> <p>These are two of the most exposed posts in the BBC. And they were doubly troubling in this 1988-92 era because of the high tide of Thatcherism, when every bulletin and programme was pored over for evidence of bias. The charge against him is that he did what was required. \"He adapted to the high point of Birtism, because he's not a maverick, and now he will be enthusiastic about Dyke's changes. There is no passion,\" says one well-placed contemporary. </p> <p>Thompson's highest-profile post, the job he most visibly enjoyed, was as controller of BBC2 between 1996 and 1998. He seemed to relax under the eye of Will Wyatt, the now-retired chief executive of BBC Broadcast - who, as Birt's unofficial deputy, advanced Thompson's career too. </p> <p>In his running of BBC2, he displayed a rare lack of personal ego and vanity. He did not try to take on the role of impresario - Yentob's style - or make it a channel in his own image, as the current controller Jane Root is doing. He clearly loved the job to bits, enthused about reading drama scripts on the train to the office, and seemed crestfallen when asked to move upwards on to the board of management. </p> <p>But his hallmark is to be an enabler, not a TV performer manqu\u00e9. Says one envious rival: \"He was very capable. But I object to him being labelled one of the best controllers BBC2 ever had. Sure, he had an 11% share. But he inherited an awful lot of things from [his predecessor] Michael Jackson and Yentob. Lifestyle programming, Tony Garnett's This Life, popular comedy.\" </p> <p>More power, if less glamour, came with the role of director of national and regional broadcasting over the past 18 months, a difficult job which Dyke believes he has performed brilliantly. Thompson likened it to \"playing three-dimensional chess\". It tested his mix of diplomacy, political wiliness and informal charm to hold the BBC together at a time of devolution - and Scottish revolt over such symbols of union as the Six O'Clock News from London. </p> <p>His determination to relaunch London's BBC station GLR last week as London Live was pursued with the zeal of an apparatchik, though he's won extra money for local radio, and reversed some daft decisions. He made sure Thames Valley radio was replaced with Radio Oxford and Radio Berkshire, and has set in train the eventual revamping of coverage of London and the south-east. </p> <p>Yet you can trot out all these bald facts about Thompson, a pale, rangy figure in nondescript suits, and miss the truth. He is posh, on paper, in background. But he doesn't sound posh, and he doesn't act it. Born in London, he grew up in Welwyn Garden City but although he seems quintessentially English, he doesn't feel so. His mother is Irish, and a devout Catholic, his father half Scottish, and an accountant in the plastics division of ICI. They had to make real sacrifices to send him to boarding school. </p> <p>Fashion has never been a priority: even at the height of Birtist clones, Armani never seemed to infiltrate his wardrobe. He wears suits with the carelessness of the little prep boy forced into them from the age of seven. He remains a devout Catholic - and is married to a beautiful American Jewish academic, Jane Blumberg. He describes with amusement how, before they married, she accompanied her future husband and mother-in-law on a trip to Bruges and was horrified to see them kneel down to kiss a sacred shrine. </p> <p>They have three children, aged between two and eight, who are being brought up as Catholics, and like several other senior broadcasting figures, he has chosen Oxford as his home. He gives every sign of having a grounded life, switching easily from the finer points of devolution to the appeal of BBC2's cult Robot Wars and Pokemon cards. An ex-Panorama executive says he's never seen him panic, only flustered, suggesting that this is the key to his rise. While editing Panorama, for example, he had to cope with the huge embarrassment in 1991 of being told to withhold the Iraqi Super Gun programme which was then trumped by ITV. He gave just enough hints to indicate his unhappiness with the Birtist thought police above him. </p> <p>\"His programmes were very straight, you might say dull. But he managed them well,\" says this source. \"He's done fantastically well, without being a visionary but by being a very, very good manager.\" </p> <p>Of course, he's blazingly ambitious. He is rated for his ability to work, to throw himself into problems.

      "bodyText": "It was an otherwise unremarkable September afternoon at the 1997 Royal Television Society convention in Cambridge when Mark Thompson's career was made. All the biggest names in broadcasting were gathered, the BBC's digital plans had been unveiled by John Birt and the hushed assembly waited to hear from one of the corporation's biggest names, Alan Yentob. But Yentob had broken a tooth on an unscheduled toffee, so instead it was the relatively junior exec Mark Thompson who stepped up to speak, unscripted, about the essence of BBC values. Looking as if he'd stepped out of an M&amp;S catalogue in a sludge-green pullover, boyishly disarming, he could have been a disaster. Yet he suddenly spoke from the heart, about what the BBC meant to him, of how its programmes were crafted with pride - he compared them to home-made, carefully prepared food. It was oddly touching and effective, distinctive in a sea of self-serving guff. Greg Dyke, then chief executive of Pearson Television, was in the audience and he was impressed. It was the first time he met Thompson and he thought anyone who could get up on stage with 10 minute's warning and speak so eloquently and effectively was worth noticing. Today, Thompson is handed a beefed-up version of Yentob's job as Dyke's de facto deputy. On such moments careers hang. You need luck, yes. But courage too. Thompson's amazing skill is to have succeeded under Birt, but to have emerged this week as the confidant to the anti-establishment outsider Dyke, becoming overseer of BBC1 and BBC2 and replacing Alan Yentob as the embodiment of BBC values. Dyke will announce today that he is diverting an extra \u00a3200m into programming from April 2001. That money is aimed at boosting the core services, especially BBC1, through his plans to create a commercially led BBC film operation unit and heavy investment in drama. Those initiatives will, through Yentob, feed through to the main channels, but the extra cash - found through cutbacks in expenditure - will enable Thompson to channel funds where they're needed, to the controllers and the commissioners. He will actually have the control. So Thompson takes yet another glittering prize, and picks up the mantle of heir apparent - assuming power without appearing to snatch it, or threaten anyone. Old BBC hands are quick to point out that he is a classic BBC man, straight out of the Alasdair Milne school of \"brahmins\" and would have prospered under any regime. \"He reminds me of the old BBC, the people who were brilliant at the politics, very intelligent, but bland,\" says a contemporary. Aged 42, he is tall - six foot three - white, upper middle class. In these rough and ready days of portable careers, short-term contracts and dot.com floats he's a bit of a throwback - having only ever worked for the BBC. Educated at public school - Stonyhurst, the Lancashire Catholic college - and Merton College, Oxford, he edited Isis and took a first in English literature. Then it was straight to the corporation in 1979 on a coveted production traineeship. He did stints on Watchdog and the launch of BBC Breakfast News in 1982, then went to America before joining Newsnight. So far, so establishment for a super-bright young man. In 1988, John Birt, as incoming deputy director-general, chose him to be editor of the Nine O'Clock News. Thompson was 30. Then two years later he was dispatched to run another Birtist priority, Panorama. These are two of the most exposed posts in the BBC. And they were doubly troubling in this 1988-92 era because of the high tide of Thatcherism, when every bulletin and programme was pored over for evidence of bias. The charge against him is that he did what was required. \"He adapted to the high point of Birtism, because he's not a maverick, and now he will be enthusiastic about Dyke's changes. There is no passion,\" says one well-placed contemporary. Thompson's highest-profile post, the job he most visibly enjoyed, was as controller of BBC2 between 1996 and 1998. He seemed to relax under the eye of Will Wyatt, the now-retired chief executive of BBC Broadcast - who, as Birt's unofficial deputy, advanced Thompson's career too. In his running of BBC2, he displayed a rare lack of personal ego and vanity. He did not try to take on the role of impresario - Yentob's style - or make it a channel in his own image, as the current controller Jane Root is doing. He clearly loved the job to bits, enthused about reading drama scripts on the train to the office, and seemed crestfallen when asked to move upwards on to the board of management. But his hallmark is to be an enabler, not a TV performer manqu\u00e9. Says one envious rival: \"He was very capable. But I object to him being labelled one of the best controllers BBC2 ever had. Sure, he had an 11% share. But he inherited an awful lot of things from [his predecessor] Michael Jackson and Yentob. Lifestyle programming, Tony Garnett's This Life, popular comedy.\" More power, if less glamour, came with the role of director of national and regional broadcasting over the past 18 months, a difficult job which Dyke believes he has performed brilliantly. Thompson likened it to \"playing three-dimensional chess\". It tested his mix of diplomacy, political wiliness and informal charm to hold the BBC together at a time of devolution - and Scottish revolt over such symbols of union as the Six O'Clock News from London. His determination to relaunch London's BBC station GLR last week as London Live was pursued with the zeal of an apparatchik, though he's won extra money for local radio, and reversed some daft decisions. He made sure Thames Valley radio was replaced with Radio Oxford and Radio Berkshire, and has set in train the eventual revamping of coverage of London and the south-east. Yet you can trot out all these bald facts about Thompson, a pale, rangy figure in nondescript suits, and miss the truth. He is posh, on paper, in background. But he doesn't sound posh, and he doesn't act it. Born in London, he grew up in Welwyn Garden City but although he seems quintessentially English, he doesn't feel so. His mother is Irish, and a devout Catholic, his father half Scottish, and an accountant in the plastics division of ICI. They had to make real sacrifices to send him to boarding school. Fashion has never been a priority: even at the height of Birtist clones, Armani never seemed to infiltrate his wardrobe. He wears suits with the carelessness of the little prep boy forced into them from the age of seven. He remains a devout Catholic - and is married to a beautiful American Jewish academic, Jane Blumberg. He describes with amusement how, before they married, she accompanied her future husband and mother-in-law on a trip to Bruges and was horrified to see them kneel down to kiss a sacred shrine. They have three children, aged between two and eight, who are being brought up as Catholics, and like several other senior broadcasting figures, he has chosen Oxford as his home. He gives every sign of having a grounded life, switching easily from the finer points of devolution to the appeal of BBC2's cult Robot Wars and Pokemon cards. An ex-Panorama executive says he's never seen him panic, only flustered, suggesting that this is the key to his rise. While editing Panorama, for example, he had to cope with the huge embarrassment in 1991 of being told to withhold the Iraqi Super Gun programme which was then trumped by ITV. He gave just enough hints to indicate his unhappiness with the Birtist thought police above him. \"His programmes were very straight, you might say dull. But he managed them well,\" says this source. \"He's done fantastically well, without being a visionary but by being a very, very good manager.\" Of course, he's blazingly ambitious. He is rated for his ability to work, to throw himself into problems. But he doesn't seem to have trampled on others too publicly. \"He is much too sophisticated for that,\" snaps an envious observer. The thinking now is that if you have creative, buzzy channel heads such as Jane Root at BBC2, Peter Salmon at BBC1 and BBC Choice's Stuart Murphy, you need a figure like Thompson to take a calm, longer view. The signs are that he's been doing that. When the furore blew up last year about Root \"axing\" One Man &amp; His Dog, Thompson confessed it had been his decision. \"Behind the scenes he's been very supportive to both Jane and Peter,\" say senior BBC sources.

      "body": "<p>Steve Coogan believes there's something out there. Somewhere in the atmosphere, it's lurking... new comedy talent. He is on a mission to befriend this alien, speak its language and harness its power. Or more specifically, sign it up for his new production company, Baby Cow. </p> <p>\"I'm not interested in empire building,\" he says. \"I just want to make good programmes with good people. I don't want to take over the world just yet.\" So he and partner Henry Normal have set up base in Brighton, started work on a selection of scripts and are currently scouting for writing-performing talent. </p> <p>The BBC also believes there's something out there. The corporation has done a development deal with Baby Cow, supplying Coogan with a six-figure sum to develop several new comedy ideas in return for a first-look commitment. Meanwhile, the BBC is running its own \u00a35m new talent drive, with the comedy side taking the form of a competition. </p> <p>Somehow the BBC initiative is less confidence-inspiring. Corporations can occasionally behave like crazed Kansas farmers, gripped by the faith that Something's Out There, convinced that if they stand in a field long enough it will simply land on the porch. Can these Unidentified Funny Objects really be lured by the simple, rural ruse of a comedy competition? </p> <p>There's a huge industry in talent-seeking competitions, workshops and festivals. The Edinburgh Festival has so many rival stand-up contests that you can hear 30 young men pointing out the hilarity of their girlfriends' foibles before you've managed to locate your revolver. And I personally have sat in at least 20 \"New Writers' Workshops\" where dozens of young men in polo necks have pitched their brilliant idea for a sitcom in which two lads share a flat and talk about girls. That's the risk in just inviting people to come along with their humour. You know your ghastly uncle who says \"Something hilarious happened to me last week\" and then bores you for an hour? That's who's going to turn up. </p> <p>Steve Coogan's big break came when he joined Radio 4's On The Hour team (later BBC2's The Day Today) which included Armando Iannucci, Patrick Marber, David Schneider, Rebecca Front, Stewart Lee and Richard Herring, who had all chanced to be at Oxford together. Coogan himself had been at college with John Thomson, and their own mates in Manchester included Henry Normal (later co-writer of The Royle Family) and Caroline Aherne. That is a quirk of geography and circumstance; a giggling baby boom. It's the secret of comedy: timing. You can launch all the New Talent Initiatives in the world but you can't fake that. </p> <p>But Coogan's own approach is more sensible. Yes, he is opening his arms to young wannabe-Coogans; fledgling Partridges. \"I want to say to any young people who have got good scripts which need a spit and a polish, and a reader who can bend the right ear at the BBC... we're here.\" </p> <p>It's not always so direct with performer-led production companies. If you go to Talkback you won't be dealing with Mel Smith and Griff Rhys Jones, nor with Rory Bremner at Vera. Steve Coogan will be busy in the next few months - in June he starts shooting a feature film, produced by Andrew McDonald and Duncan Kenworthy, in which he plays a parole officer who robs a bank. Next year there will be a new Alan Partridge series, in which we may see the hapless Alan in improved circumstances. \"Perhaps he'll be working as a regional newscaster, back on his feet but not quite at the dizzy heights of network television. I can see his dress sense changing slightly: you might see a leather bomber jacket and running shoes... and perhaps a new car. But not a Rover. He'd distance himself from Rover as a career decision.\" </p> <p>So plenty of performing projects on the go - nevertheless, if you send scripts to Baby Cow, \"Henry and I will read them\". But he is also doing specific talent-targeting. The BBC has already green-lit two series from Baby Cow: a sitcom \"in a documentary style\" about dysfunctional couples, and a comedy drama (starring Coogan himself) about an English architect in Glasgow. Both involve writers (Julia Davis, Rob Bryden and Annie Griffin) contacted by Coogan because he had seen and admired their work. He also has his sometime co-writer Peter Baynham developing an animation series. </p> <p>He is clearly relishing the opportunity to talent-spot across the airwaves and clubs; but he knows it's not enough just to find the talent. That's the mistake that TV executives make, and Coogan is \"on the side of the performer\". The crucial requirement is to use it properly. </p> <p>\"When you get involved in television you can get bogged down in the mechanics and lose sight of the basics, like quality of material. Stand-ups are often just plonked on TV - the producer points a camera at them and hopes they'll be funny. But something happens when it goes down a cathode ray tube: sucks the comedy out of an idea.\" </p> <p>Asked for an example he cites Johnny Vegas, who was rushed on to Channel 4 after storming the 1998 Edinburgh Festival. \"I'm a huge fan of Johnny Vegas, but that show shouldn't have been aired. It should have been a non-broadcast pilot to help him in the learning process. You need time to think through the rules of this particular medium.\" </p> <p>The other way that young comics are misused is to be \"put in a sitcom that doesn't do them justice. You can't really impose an idea on a comic. You need other people around to stop them making mistakes. I want to be one of those people.\" </p> <p>For Steve Coogan himself, \"those people\" have been Marber, Normal and Iannucci. What he would like to recreate, in his new role at Baby Cow, is Iannucci's skill in assembling the Day Today team. Sure, he got lucky in his classmates at Oxford - but it was inspired producing to introduce both Coogan and that broadcasting genius Christopher Morris. The quality of the team enabled them all to shine, rescuing them from the Johnny Vegas fate of working alone too early. </p> <p>Any chance of another series of The Day Today? \"I would love to work with them again. Chris was modest enough to play a farmer in the last series of Alan Partridge: it was quite funny telling him what to do. I don't think many people get to do that. But the ethos behind The Day Today was that we knew we were cutting edge, and we've all gone in different directions. To re-form now...it would be pissing on the chips that we so nicely fried seven years ago.\" </p> <p>Coogan's own attempt to form a team of promising new talent is a sketch show idea for BBC1. A pilot has been commissioned, to be co-produced with Avalon. \"One area that has been neglected in TV is solid, quality, one-nation comedy. There's a lot of very good esoteric stuff, such as Big Train, Smack The Pony and The League of Gentlemen, but we want to make a mainstream sketch show which isn't just brainless.\" </p> <p>There are those who will say that the production company is a vanity deal; that Coogan is an unproved producer and the BBC is supplying him with development money to keep him sweet as a performer. He is the first to admit that the haemorrhaging of other Corporation stars, which saw the likes of Frank Skinner and Des Lynam skipping down the steps of White City tube and getting the first money train outta there, was \"probably helpful for me\". </p> <p>But the development money is not a ludicrous amount and, in truth, Coogan has proved his grasp of televisual mechanics in his career as a performer. His was the first pure television generation. </p> <p>In the old days, it was always said (and rightly) of performers such as Ken Dodd, Mike Reid and Bob Monkhouse that you could never fully appreciate their art without seeing them live. On stage was where they excelled. </p> <p>For Coogan's gang, the opposite was true. Coogan is a fine live performer but anyone who has seen him (or Patrick Marber, or Armando Iannucci or Caroline Aherne) doing stand-up would turn to their neighbour and say \"Ah... but you should see what they can do with television.\" </p> <p>They were born for that medium. The Day Today, Alan Partridge, Mrs Merton - and of course, Brass Eye - were crafted from perfect observation of the workings of TV, its stars and clich\u00e9s. What better way to demonstrate a masterful understanding of programme-making than with a finely executed pastiche? </p> <p>Coogan, one therefore senses, is to be trusted. \"I've got the ear of the BBC, and also a certain amount of respect from young performers because they like my work,\" he says. \"I know from my own experience as a young comic that there's a lot of mistrust about people in suits telling you how to do comedy. I'm trying to be a producer who doesn't wear a suit. And they can't say I don't know how to do comedy, because I've done it. It's as simple as that.\"</p>",

There's a lot of very good esoteric stuff, such as Big Train, Smack The Pony and The League of Gentlemen, but we want to make a mainstream sketch show which isn't just brainless.\" There are those who will say that the production company is a vanity deal; that Coogan is an unproved producer and the BBC is supplying him with development money to keep him sweet as a performer. He is the first to admit that the haemorrhaging of other Corporation stars, which saw the likes of Frank Skinner and Des Lynam skipping down the steps of White City tube and getting the first money train outta there, was \"probably helpful for me\". But the development money is not a ludicrous amount and, in truth, Coogan has proved his grasp of televisual mechanics in his career as a performer. His was the first pure television generation. In the old days, it was always said (and rightly) of performers such as Ken Dodd, Mike Reid and Bob Monkhouse that you could never fully appreciate their art without seeing them live. On stage was where they excelled. For Coogan's gang, the opposite was true. Coogan is a fine live performer but anyone who has seen him (or Patrick Marber, or Armando Iannucci or Caroline Aherne) doing stand-up would turn to their neighbour and say \"Ah... but you should see what they can do with television.\" They were born for that medium. The Day Today, Alan Partridge, Mrs Merton - and of course, Brass Eye - were crafted from perfect observation of the workings of TV, its stars and clich\u00e9s. What better way to demonstrate a masterful understanding of programme-making than with a finely executed pastiche? Coogan, one therefore senses, is to be trusted. \"I've got the ear of the BBC, and also a certain amount of respect from young performers because they like my work,\" he says. \"I know from my own experience as a young comic that there's a lot of mistrust about people in suits telling you how to do comedy. I'm trying to be a producer who doesn't wear a suit. And they can't say I don't know how to do comedy, because I've done it. It's as simple as that.\"",

I received three calls from radio researchers asking me to speculate on what the announcement might mean. </p> <p>Friends at the Times offered me their opinions. Most thought it was a device by Rupert Murdoch to remove Stothard from the editorship. But one, much the most sensible and experienced among them, cautioned me against such a view. Murdoch liked Stothard. After a long campaign, he had acceded to Stothard's request to spend millions reconfiguring presses to allow him to publish the Times in a new structure. He said: \"Why would he ditch him now? It doesn't make sense.\" </p> <p>But he did concede that the claim that Stothard was taking a sort of sabbatical while researching the internet didn't ring true either. Late in the afternoon I got a call about \"the latest rumour\". It was being suggested that Stothard had cancer. Seconds later, a Radio 4 researcher called. Would I be prepared to comment on \"the real reason Stothard was being removed\"? </p> <p>And what was that? Well, she said, there were two \"theories\". One was that Murdoch was sacrificing Stothard in some unspecified - and, on reflection, inexplicable - deal to placate Tory treasurer Michael Ashcroft, who settled a high-profile libel action with the paper in December. The second was even more far-fetched, suggesting that Murdoch wanted to move the Times closer to the Tory party in the run-up to the next election and didn't think Stothard the man to reposition the paper's politics. </p> <p>I dismissed the latter out of hand, asked for clarification of the former and told her she should consider two other possibilities: that the announcement was, even if clumsy, true; or that Stothard might be ill. I then called Wapping's corporate affairs office to mention the cancer rumour. It was not denied or confirmed and, despite my years of experience in the ritual of divining what PRs mean when they don't say no and they don't say yes, I didn't \"read\" that conversation with the clarity I should have done. </p> <p>But it did make me suspicious enough to turn down all requests for radio interviews. Similar non-denials and even denials didn't halt the wilder shores of speculation elsewhere, including the Guardian. A front-page story said the future of the Times editor was \"in doubt\" and the Ashcroft gossip was rehearsed inside. Both the Guardian and the Independent speculated on possible successors to Stothard. </p> <p>Next morning Radio 4's Today programme - unable to find an outside commentator willing to broadcast - enlarged on the speculation with an \"interview\" between presenter James Naughtie and one of the BBC's own political correspondents, John Kampfner. </p> <p>It was clear that the cautious Kampfner was consistently pushed further than he wished to go by Naughtie, who gave the impression of being convinced that Stothard was being ditched as editor. </p> <p>Perhaps he was influenced by the knowledge that some of the Tory hierarchy were letting it be known that the Ashcroft affair had played some part in Stothard's supposed downfall. Some journalists were briefed to that effect. \"I had no conversations with Central Office,\" said Kampfner. But he concedes that \"a tip\" had been given to \"someone\" at Today and that \"the place was rife with people pretending to know the inside story\". </p> <p>At least one close friend of Ashcroft, building on rumours from sources within the Times, was prepared to tell journalists that Stothard's leave of absence was entirely due to the Ashcroft affair. </p> <p>Given the level of \"mounting\" speculation, it was hardly a surprise that the London Evening Standard's media pages weighed in with an article purporting to report on the \"rumour mill\" and \"fevered gossip\" while adding substantially to it. </p> <p>The fact that it was written by a reputable journalist known for his fairness and objectivity says much about the direction journalism has taken. It's too quick to think, too ready to speculate on the flimsiest of evidence and too prepared to accept a conspiracy theory rather than the mundane truth. </p> <p>The Standard piece was pulled from later editions once Stothard, realising that his attempt to keep his illness private was no longer tenable, broke the news of his treatment for a neuro endocrine tumour of the pancreas.

It's number one because the ads are great. There was the Khakis a-go-go ad with everyone raving like demented 60s pixies, the country ad with models line-dancing to Crazy Little Thing Called Love, and the Christmas ads with ice skating kids merging in and out of each other to a mixed-up seasonal soundtrack. </p> <p>Mark Ratcliffe, who runs youth consultancy Murmur, says that every time he runs youth focus groups Gap campaigns always come out in teens' and twentysomethings' top 10s.

They seem to work. The Gap stopped advertising on television in the 1960s and concentrated on print work, using the celeb-heavy Individuals of Style campaign. Over the past 10 years, however, the classic white background with the not-too-modelly models sporting this season's Gap apparel took over the print and posters work. Finally, three years ago, the brand went back to TV and 18 months ago overtook Levi's as the world's biggest clothing manufacturer. </p> <p>Now there's a new campaign, which premiered in the US in the first ad break of the Oscars and arrived in the UK this weekend in the breaks in the Hollyoaks omnibus and Blind Date. Using a West Side Story soundtrack, the commercials have a camped-up, showbizzy feel that wasn't there before. </p> <p>The campaign is in three parts - Khakis Cool, Denim America and Are You A Jean Or A Khaki? Khakis uses Boy, Boy, Crazy Boy as the theme with khaki-clad Jets clicking their fingers and grooving around. Denim gives us la-la-la-la-la America and the flamboyant Shark routines, then there's the nightclub mambo face-off and a huge synchronised dance number that would make the movie's choreographer Jerome Robbins proud. Significantly, The Gap's signature white environment has gone, replaced by backlit reds, yellows and blues. What, no white? </p> <p>\"I think minimalism is over now,\" explains Jim Nevins, Gap's executive vice-president of global marketing. \"We've all been there and done that. People are into sheer exuberance and entertainment. We've never done something from the theatrical tradition before so we've returned to this vast entertainment concept.\" But doesn't that look terribly camp? \"Well, there's a wink to it all. We've been criticised for being too serious in the past so we've turned to this theatricality to provide that wink. It just looks refreshing.\" </p> <p>Curiously, and perhaps tellingly, The Gap has made these ads itself. It has refused to use an advertising agency since the 1960s. \"Why would we get outsiders and have them tell us who we are?\" says Nevins. \"The strongest brands in the world have a much clearer idea of their own image than any advertising agency ever could.\" Instead, the company's marketing department creates all its adverts, from print to television. </p> <p>\"We're structured a little like an agency,\" Nevins admits, \"with art directors, editors and account managers. On the creative side, therefore, we operate like one. We also try to keep abreast of popular culture in a way that lots of agencies don't manage and we've always been concerned with creating a signature style that goes through the ads and into the stores. It's far easier to do that if the people making the ads work for the same company as the people in the stores. We don't see our ads as hard sell, we see them as pieces of entertainment and pieces of popular culture.\" </p> <p>Not having an advertising agency is heresy in adland. \"Where's that sort of behaviour going to get people?\" the argument goes. \"You need proper advertising professionals to create professional advertising. What's the benefit of doing something that important yourself?\" Well, for one thing it's bought The Gap global dominance at a seriously discounted rate. Last year, across all its brands including Old Navy and Banana Republic, the company spent $4.5m worldwide on advertising, less than half Coca-Cola's spend. </p> <p>The Gap's advertising thus helps it achieve something unusual on the British high street. It enables it to stay securely in the mid-market as the spending patterns in British fashion retail split wide apart. These days, British punters love designer labels and discounted goods, often buying discounted gear to put money aside for one or two really fancy bits of clobber. The old idea of solid, respectable mid-market clothing is vanishing. They call it the democratisation of style: retail analysts, such as Richard Hyman at Verdict Research, believe it's likely to become permanent as clothes-buying motivation increasingly shifts from need to want. Hence the problems besetting British Home Stores and Marks &amp; Spencer, which traditionally benefited from their ability to be solid and reliable. </p> <p>\"The Gap set out as a reliable, cheap clothing store, but the ads have somehow managed to give it a cool, non-confrontational image,\" says Johnny Davis, editor of the Face. \"Their celebrity endorsements put Calvin Klein to shame. Getting Missy Elliott for last winter's press work was inspired. There's absolutely no shame in wearing a Gap T-shirt, but that's not true of the more fuddy-duddy British high street stores and that's showing in their sales.\" </p> <p>Curiously, as M&amp;S embarks on a bid to claw back its vanishing customers, it appears to be ignoring the lesson of The Gap. The store chain employed an external consultant, Interbrand Newell &amp; Sorrell, to redesign its brand over 12 months - the kind of outside interference that sends Nevins pale with fear. Last week, Interbrand reported back, suggesting new fronts for all stores, a new font for the M&amp;S logo, several new types of carrier bag, including a paper carrier and a duffel-style bag, and a tweak in the bags' colour. At the same time, M&amp;S is beginning a trawl of advertising agencies. </p> <p>I asked to speak to the person concerned with the whole M&amp;S brand including the appointment of the ad agency. That wasn't possible, I was told. These are two separate jobs. One person looks after the stores' brand image and another looks after the advertising. And you can't speak to the advertising person anyway. </p> <p>Nevins found the division of jobs incomprehensible but has problems of his own. \"We're the Madonna of advertising,\" he grimaces. \"People keep expecting us to come up with original ads. It's a struggle.\" His advice for M&amp;S? \"We wish them luck. We find this stuff hard enough ourselves without butting in on other people.\"</p>",

What's the benefit of doing something that important yourself?\" Well, for one thing it's bought The Gap global dominance at a seriously discounted rate. Last year, across all its brands including Old Navy and Banana Republic, the company spent $4.5m worldwide on advertising, less than half Coca-Cola's spend. The Gap's advertising thus helps it achieve something unusual on the British high street. It enables it to stay securely in the mid-market as the spending patterns in British fashion retail split wide apart. These days, British punters love designer labels and discounted goods, often buying discounted gear to put money aside for one or two really fancy bits of clobber. The old idea of solid, respectable mid-market clothing is vanishing. They call it the democratisation of style: retail analysts, such as Richard Hyman at Verdict Research, believe it's likely to become permanent as clothes-buying motivation increasingly shifts from need to want. Hence the problems besetting British Home Stores and Marks &amp; Spencer, which traditionally benefited from their ability to be solid and reliable. \"The Gap set out as a reliable, cheap clothing store, but the ads have somehow managed to give it a cool, non-confrontational image,\" says Johnny Davis, editor of the Face. \"Their celebrity endorsements put Calvin Klein to shame. Getting Missy Elliott for last winter's press work was inspired. There's absolutely no shame in wearing a Gap T-shirt, but that's not true of the more fuddy-duddy British high street stores and that's showing in their sales.\" Curiously, as M&amp;S embarks on a bid to claw back its vanishing customers, it appears to be ignoring the lesson of The Gap. The store chain employed an external consultant, Interbrand Newell &amp; Sorrell, to redesign its brand over 12 months - the kind of outside interference that sends Nevins pale with fear. Last week, Interbrand reported back, suggesting new fronts for all stores, a new font for the M&amp;S logo, several new types of carrier bag, including a paper carrier and a duffel-style bag, and a tweak in the bags' colour. At the same time, M&amp;S is beginning a trawl of advertising agencies. I asked to speak to the person concerned with the whole M&amp;S brand including the appointment of the ad agency. That wasn't possible, I was told. These are two separate jobs. One person looks after the stores' brand image and another looks after the advertising. And you can't speak to the advertising person anyway. Nevins found the division of jobs incomprehensible but has problems of his own. \"We're the Madonna of advertising,\" he grimaces. \"People keep expecting us to come up with original ads. It's a struggle.\" His advice for M&amp;S? \"We wish them luck. We find this stuff hard enough ourselves without butting in on other people.\"",

      "body": "<p>Robert Mugabe has ruled Zimbabwe for twenty years, taking it from modest prosperity to the brink of economic meltdown. He came to power after the old white-rule regime collapsed, and although he has preached national reconciliation, the country remains deeply divided on ethnic lines - not just between whites and blacks, but between the majority Shona people and the powerful Ndebele and other minority groups.</p> <p>Throughout his rise to power and since, Mugabe has radiated strength and steely determination. Born on February 21, 1924, he was raised in the north of what was Southern Rhodesia, on a mission settlement in Mashonaland. There he received a Jesuit education, and worked as a cowherd before qualifying as a primary school teacher. Later, he studied at Fort Hare university in South Africa, gaining a BA degree in 1951 followed be a spell of teaching in West Africa, where he acquired a passionate interest in Marxist theory.</p> <p>In 1960, the year British prime minister Harold Macmillan spoke of the \"wind of change\" blowing through Africa, Mugabe entered politics, joining the National Democratic Party headed by veteran independence campaigner Joshua Nkomo.</p> <p>The NDP was banned, and subsequently replaced by the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU). But soon Mugabe split with Nkomo, and set up his own Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU). Both parties were quickly banned by the white-rule government.</p> <p>Mugabe and Nkomo were arrested shortly before Rhodesian prime minister Ian Smith declared unilateral independence from Britain in 1965. Mugabe used his ten years behind bars to study law. By the time he was released in 1974, ZAPU and ZANU had formed a joint guerrilla army, the Patriotic Front, to fight the illegal Smith regime.</p> <p>The war was vicious and prolonged.

      "bodyText": "Robert Mugabe has ruled Zimbabwe for twenty years, taking it from modest prosperity to the brink of economic meltdown. He came to power after the old white-rule regime collapsed, and although he has preached national reconciliation, the country remains deeply divided on ethnic lines - not just between whites and blacks, but between the majority Shona people and the powerful Ndebele and other minority groups. Throughout his rise to power and since, Mugabe has radiated strength and steely determination. Born on February 21, 1924, he was raised in the north of what was Southern Rhodesia, on a mission settlement in Mashonaland. There he received a Jesuit education, and worked as a cowherd before qualifying as a primary school teacher. Later, he studied at Fort Hare university in South Africa, gaining a BA degree in 1951 followed be a spell of teaching in West Africa, where he acquired a passionate interest in Marxist theory. In 1960, the year British prime minister Harold Macmillan spoke of the \"wind of change\" blowing through Africa, Mugabe entered politics, joining the National Democratic Party headed by veteran independence campaigner Joshua Nkomo. The NDP was banned, and subsequently replaced by the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU). But soon Mugabe split with Nkomo, and set up his own Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU). Both parties were quickly banned by the white-rule government. Mugabe and Nkomo were arrested shortly before Rhodesian prime minister Ian Smith declared unilateral independence from Britain in 1965. Mugabe used his ten years behind bars to study law. By the time he was released in 1974, ZAPU and ZANU had formed a joint guerrilla army, the Patriotic Front, to fight the illegal Smith regime. The war was vicious and prolonged. In 1980 Rhodesia briefly reverted to British colonial rule and elections were held for the first time with universal suffrage. Many British officials believed that Nkomo, the father of the freedom struggle, would be rewarded by the liberated voters. But Nkomo's power base was in the south, in Ndebeland. Mugabe had the support of the much larger Shona people, and won a landslide victory. He has ruled ever since, as prime minister and (since 1987) as president. In the beginning, he formed an all-party government, but as early as 1982 he fell out with Nkomo and sacked him from the cabinet. The increasingly autocratic Mugabe has browbeaten, dismissed and intimidated his rivals, to the extent that in the presidential election of 1996, none dared oppose him. Though the press has remained free, there have also been barely-veiled attempts to stifle criticism of the ZANU-PF ruling party. Radio and television are government controlled, and slavishly pro-Mugabe. In recent years there has been a rising tide of protest against the authoritarianism and corruption of the regime. Discontent has been fuelled by the parlous state of the economy, where inflation rages and more than half the workforce is unemployed. To add to the nation's misery, an estimated 250,000 people were left homeless by disastrous floods in February and March. The flashpoint issue now is Mugabe's support for the seizure of white-owned farms by landless peasants - his own kind.

      "body": "<p>Annie Machon and her boyfriend, David Shayler, the former MI5 officers now living in Paris, have got used to feeling watched. Their phone plays up. Their emails go missing. Even the walls of their flat seem to look down on them. If they want to discuss \"an issue\", they find a safe cafe to do it in. A different one each time? \"Of course,\" says Machon with a slight curve to her lips. And in bed? \"We have discussed that, yes,\" she says. \"You just try and blank it out and get on with your life.\"</p> <p>She is poised and controlled. She remains cool even when recalling \"sweaty coppers\" reading out her love letters in the course of an interrogation. Even when describing the state of her underwear (\"inside out, with the crotches turned up as if they'd been sniffing them\") after their flat in Pimlico had been searched.</p> <p>Machon, who is 31, has been at Shayler's side since he fled to France in 1997 to escape prosecution for breaking the Official Secrets Act when his claims of MI5 incompetence were first published in a Sunday newspaper. They packed for a fortnight. They've been gone two and a half years.</p> <p>Shayler is a straightforward love or hate figure. He is either the whistleblower, fired by moral purpose to draw attention to bungling within the intelligence services, from revelations that they monitored \"subversives\" including such threats to national security as Harriet Harman and the reggae band UB40, to his more recent allegations that MI6 was behind an illegal assassination attempt on Muammar Gadafy, the Libyan president. Or, as MI5 would have it (in an interesting m\u00e9lange of contradictions), he is the traitor, the self-publicist, the breaker of official secrets, the fantasist.</p> <p>Machon has remained a much more enigmatic figure. At first she was just \"Shayler's girlfriend\". With her blonde hair and big blue eyes, she looked like a deb, a nursery school teacher, caught up in events beyond her control. A former MI5 officer herself, she made no direct allegations while supporting Shayler in his. But this may not have been caution so much as sound management.</p> <p>Unlike Shayler (who spent four months in jail before extradition proceedings failed; he is now being sued in the civil courts) she is at liberty to come and go in Britain. \"It's important that I remain free to travel, important I remain out of reproach.\"</p> <p>Machon was in London to deliver to Scotland Yard a dossier supporting Shayler's Gadafy claims (an MI6 file recently posted on the internet also appears to confirm the allegations). She holds press conferences. She meets with MPs. With lawyers. She wants accountability. She wants freedom of expression. She wants amnesty. She wants Shayler to be listened to. Taken seriously. To be allowed home. Then she wants to be left alone.</p> <p>We meet at Vauxhall underground station, close by the MI6 building, although she doesn't want to hang around long. The closest cafe is too close. She walks very fast to the next. She doesn't look over her shoulder once. She sees connections where others might see blank walls. There are advertisements for laptops nearby. She refers to the recent stories of the mugged MI5 officer, whose laptop was nicked and the drunken MI6 officer who mislaid his. \"What a coincidence,\" she smiles sardonically. If she and Shayler win their case, she says she doesn't think they'll ever come back to London. \"Dave would feel quite uncomfortable living here,\" she says. \"I would too. It's just that sense of unease all the time.\"</p> <p>She is all in black, although her nails are gold. She is pale and slim, unlike Shayler whose plumpness in photographs can make him look like a yob. (\"He put on weight at MI5, actually. Socialising after work - that drinking culture he talked about - and also a sense of unease. He eats when he's feeling stressed. He's joined a health club now. He swims nearly every day.\")</p> <p>It's not the only reason they seem an unlikely couple. A Middlesbrough boy, with working-class roots, Shayler is said to be chippy about public-school Oxbridge types.</p> <p>Machon, who is the daughter of a pilot turned newspaperman, and from an old Guernsey family, went to a private girls' school and then to Cambridge, where she studied classics. \"Yes, yes, I know. I think he did think I was a bit posh at first, but he squared it with the fact that I was a scholarship girl. Also we both moved around a lot when we were young. We had that in common.\"</p> <p>Machon says that as soon as they met in an MI5 library they made each other laugh and that their relationship is \"passionate\". There are hints of that in her story. The night before she came back to England for the first time, suspecting she would be arrested, but not sure whether they would confiscate her passport, they lay in bed and held each other and cried, \"not knowing when we would see each other again\". Then, after 10 months in hiding at a farmhouse in south-west France, when he was suddenly taken into custody, for days she walked around with \"no one's hand in mine\".</p> <p>Interestingly, too, while Machon looks as though butter wouldn't melt in her mouth, she found out soon after joining MI5 (after sitting the foreign office exams), that psychological profiling had marked her out as a maverick. \"I was having a bit of a debate with my manager in the office and she said, 'I've been warned about you'.\" She smiles enigmatically. \"I was quite flattered.\"</p> <p>She and Shayler had already left MI5 when Shayler decided to go public, both had nice well-paid jobs as management consultants. They had a nice social life, nice Pimlico flat. She didn't want him to go to the papers. \"It wasn't so much doubt as fear. I knew they'd come after us and I knew what they could do against us. If you've worked for MI5 it doesn't help your paranoia, put it that way.\"</p> <p>She slips a lighter out of her cigarette packet and lights up. \"And I must say I was shown to be right. Not that I'd ever say I told you so to Dave.\"</p> <p>The papers ran the story on a bank holiday weekend. Machon and Shayler got the last plane out of Heathrow on the Saturday night, to Amsterdam. They braced themselves. Then Diana, Princess of Wales was killed. \"In one sense it was a relief because the pressure was taken off us. In another it was terrible. An injunction had been put on the paper and if she hadn't died, Fleet Street would have been up in arms about gagging the free press, they would have been more balanced in their assessment of Dave, demanding inquiries. As it was, there were a lot of backroom briefings against him, saying he was a loudmouth, unbalanced, and we were buried there.\"</p> <p>She uses the word \"buried\" a lot. It's hard to tell whether it is a good thing or a bad thing for someone who needs publicity (\"it's our only protection\") and yet longs to hide. On the run, they \"buried themselves\" in the French countryside, a different hotel every night, paying cash.</p> <p>After that they were \"buried\" again in a remote farmhouse near Perpignan, \"freezing cold, miles from the shops\", living off their \u00a340,000 newspaper earnings, where Shayler wrote his novel (it has since been banned) and she kept house. The British government pretended to negotiate with them, she says. \"They thought we'd run out of money and rot abroad. They wanted to bury us.\"</p> <p>It was only when Shayler was in prison, when the worst had happened, that she got her confidence back. \"I found I was tougher than I thought. Dave had always been the more ebullient character. And suddenly when he was arrested, even though I was desperately lonely, it was, 'Right, you've got to do it.'\"</p> <p>Actually, there was worse to come: an approach by an armed Libyan a week after Shayler's release. He offered a six-figure sum in exchange for names linked to the Gadafy plot and evidence on Lockerbie (Shayler had been an expert). He followed them when they refused. A few nights later their buzzer rang for five minutes in the night: \"We cowered in the corner with our kitchen knives.\" They reported the incident to MI5, and were told it was a matter for the French, who told them it was a matter for the Brits.</p> <p>What does Machon hope for now? She says she can't think what to do with her life. \"I'm a different person to the one I was two years ago.\" Maybe an old house in Normandy: Shayler could continue writing, novels, his column for Punch.</p> <p>What about children? \"I don't want those. Neither of us does. We never have. I'm not at all maternal. I've never felt the desire. My brother is 11 years younger and I don't have a romantic view of children. I know what they're like.\"</p> <p>I was going to suggest that when she hits her mid-30s she might change her mind, but then I saw the look in her eye and changes of mind didn't seem to come into it.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The BBC's Director-General, Greg Dyke, has today unveiled both the BBC's new management structure and the names of the senior executives who will drive the BBC forward in the early years of the 21st century.</p> <p>The key things the changes are designed to bring over the next few years are:</p> <p>\u0095 More money into programmes and services - at least \u00a3100m in the new financial year with our proportionate spend in this area moving from 76% up to 85% . We have tough savings targets set by government - at least \u00a31 for \u00a31, needing \u00a31bn over 7 years. This is an extra \u00a3490m over our existing, challenging savings plans.</p> <p>\u0095 Programmes, creativity and channel interests come closer to the heart of the organisation - 4 representatives currently, up to 9 on the new top team.</p> <p>\u0095 \"One BBC\" - a flatter, more inclusive structure. More collaboration, less internal competition, less management.</p> <p>\u0095 We become more agile, flexible and adaptive with speedier responses and faster decision making to cope with the speed of change in the market.</p> <p>\u0095 Broadcasting and programme production come closer. Programme guarantees are introduced for in-house production, including in the Nations and Regions; plus re-integration of commissioning and production in Sport, Childrens and Education. This frees in-house production departments to focus on creativity, while accepting the best ideas from independents as part of our 25% television quota.</p> <p>Further information:</p> <p>Greg told BBC staff in a special session this morning that his aim in the next five years is to reduce the amount of money currently spent on running the BBC from 24% of its total income to 15% over a five year period.

      "bodyText": "The BBC's Director-General, Greg Dyke, has today unveiled both the BBC's new management structure and the names of the senior executives who will drive the BBC forward in the early years of the 21st century. The key things the changes are designed to bring over the next few years are: \u0095 More money into programmes and services - at least \u00a3100m in the new financial year with our proportionate spend in this area moving from 76% up to 85% . We have tough savings targets set by government - at least \u00a31 for \u00a31, needing \u00a31bn over 7 years. This is an extra \u00a3490m over our existing, challenging savings plans. \u0095 Programmes, creativity and channel interests come closer to the heart of the organisation - 4 representatives currently, up to 9 on the new top team. \u0095 \"One BBC\" - a flatter, more inclusive structure. More collaboration, less internal competition, less management. \u0095 We become more agile, flexible and adaptive with speedier responses and faster decision making to cope with the speed of change in the market. \u0095 Broadcasting and programme production come closer. Programme guarantees are introduced for in-house production, including in the Nations and Regions; plus re-integration of commissioning and production in Sport, Childrens and Education. This frees in-house production departments to focus on creativity, while accepting the best ideas from independents as part of our 25% television quota. Further information: Greg told BBC staff in a special session this morning that his aim in the next five years is to reduce the amount of money currently spent on running the BBC from 24% of its total income to 15% over a five year period. This will free up an additional \u00a3200m a year to be spent on programmes and will help meet the government's savings target for the BBC of \u00a31.2bn worth of savings over the next seven years. Greg also announced that the BBC will be spending at least \u00a3100m more on BBC programming and services in the coming year. Greg said: \"As a result of the review we have taken out a complete level of management in the new structure. It's flatter, inclusive, and will result in more collaboration and less internal competition; more leadership and less management. We are also rationalising our support services, which have expanded markedly in recent years. \"Our aim is to create One BBC, where people enjoy their job and are inspired and united behind the common purpose of making great programmes and delivering outstanding services.\" BBC chairman Sir Christopher Bland has explained that Greg's plans have been discussed at length and in detail with the board of governors over the last six weeks. Sir Christopher said: \"We need to adapt our organisation structure to encourage creativity, to speed up our decision-making, to communicate more effectively internally and externally, to obtain significant savings and to enhance the value we provide to licence fee payers in a highly competitive world. We believe that Greg's plans will achieve these objectives.\" Greg will lead a new executive committee of 17 directors, bringing him closer to key editorial and programming decisions and bringing the creative community closer to him. Of the 17, nine will be broadcasting and programming heads, compared with four in the existing executive. This is a deliberate shift in the balance of the top level committee towards the programme, creative and channel interests of the BBC. Six professional service divisions are created to be responsible for all administrative services across the BBC. Greg said: \"Cutting duplication across the BBC should make us more agile and more flexible, giving us more money to put into the heart of the BBC - the programmes.\" A new leadership group, involving the top 50 or 60 people in the BBC, will foster greater cross fertilisation of ideas and provide a forum where they can learn more about developments across the whole organisation and the outside world. The plans are the result of a four-month review undertaken by a small team that listened to the views of many people throughout the BBC. Key changes include: \u0095 the creation of four programming divisions: - Drama, Entertainment and Children - Factual and Learning - Sport - News \u0095 abolition of Broadcast and Production directorate HQs \u0095 in the areas of sport, childrens and education, commissioning and programme-making will be re-integrated \u0095 a New Media division will develop the BBC's interactive television and online activities \u0095 TV genre commissioners in drama, entertainment and features. These commissioners will work with the television channel controllers to strengthen the BBC's output in these areas the \u0095 disbanding of the Independent Commissioning Group. The BBC values the contribution of independents, but in future they will take the same commissioning routes as in-house producers \u0095 output guarantees for in-house departments, including Nations and English Regions, and longer-term commissions to enable better planning and greater focus on creativity \u0095 BBC Radio takes over full responsibility for Radio 5-Live commissioning \u0095 Music Production moves into the Radio Division to work more closely with the networks they serve. They will also produce classical music programmes for television \u0095 simplified internal trading - the business units will be reduced from 190 to 50 \u0095 the Corporate Centre, including Policy and Planning and Corporate Affairs, disappear. Instead, six Professional Service Divisions will support the BBC overall. They are: Public Policy; Human Resources and Internal Communications; Distribution and Technology; Finance, Property and Business Affairs; Marketing and Communications; and Strategy \u0095 reporting structures in the Nations and Regions are unchanged but the division moves one step closer to the Director-General with the director sitting on the Executive Committee \u0095 in Birmingham, Bristol and Manchester one operational head will be asked to lead the BBC's activities in each centre. \u0095 News, apart from the move of Radio 5-Live commissioning, remains unchanged. BBC Worldwide, BBC World Service and BBC Resources are largely unchanged. \u0095 The new structure takes effect from today (April 3rd). An implementation team will work with each director to draw up detailed plans within two months, for full implementation by the autumn.",

China has also abolished the \"two guarantees\" under which college students enjoyed free tuition and maintenance - and were then assigned a job. \"Students used to say that once I enter the gates of university, I shall be taken care of by the state,\" says a college pro fessor. \"Now we have broken this pattern and expanded the choices of both students and society.\" They must now find their fees and compete for jobs.

We've been down at the Celtic Manor Resort just outside Newport for four days which is an absolutely amazing place. The facilities are just incredible and even the weather's been all right. We couldn't have asked for a better start before we get outside in the nets on Monday. </p> <p>I've been running through the valleys and over the hills, doing all that stuff which the coaches love. It was a real laugh going paintballing, orienteering and playing golf - all in the name of team-building. I really enjoyed the golf down here because I don't usually get a chance to play enough to get my handicap down from 14.</p> <p>The paintballing was good and you have to really think, as well as make sure you don't get shot. You've got to think about sneaking up on the enemy and taking them by surprise. Something we'll hopefully be using on the cricket field. My team came second behind the Judge's [Robin Smith]. But he didn't do too well when it came to the orienteering. He was very much last in the competition and kept on getting lost. But what do you expect when you let a South African loose in Wales? He probably kept on bumping into sheep out there.</p> <p>I was able to enjoy all this running around much more this year because I've been on an intensive six-week gym session with a personal trainer. I've realised that it's even more important to keep fit as you get older. I've been doing a lot of cardio-vascular and strength work. It's good to have someone watching over you who makes you do it. I never used to like it but now it's all part of the job. Jimmy Cook [Hampshire's new coach] is really keen on it as well, so I don't have a choice.</p> <p>I made sure that I spent a lot of time with my family over Christmas, which was really important to me. I just had a quiet time at home. I was lucky to be able to go back to the printing firm [7 Corners Printing Group] where I worked as a salesman last winter. They've been really understanding and want me back next year. I've managed to fit everything in and juggle the two careers pretty well. Although I wasn't able to go on Smithy's tour to South Africa. The tours are a real laugh and I was a bit disappointed not to go. I just couldn't fit it all in, not with my family as well.</p> <p>I'm looking forward to the season, we're all really excited about Warney coming over. I spoke to him on the phone last week and he can't wait to get here. He seems to be a big fan of Hampshire already and we're determined to give him a number-one welcome for the world No. 1. We're going to have a dinner and then a few beers the night that he arrives. It's going to be great bowling with him and he's certainly going to pull in the crowds.\"</p> <p><em>Shaun Udal was shouting down his mobile at Simon Byrne</em></p>",

Britain did fund a land redistribution programme in the 1980s but stopped in the 1990s, saying it was being used to benefit Mr Mugabe's cronies and government supporters.

Since independence in 1980, Mr Mugabe has carried out limited redistribution, buying white-owned farms and turning them over to poor blacks. But in past weeks, hundreds of white-owned farms have been occupied by black squatters claiming the land as their own. It is widely believed that the campaign is orchestrated by the government through the secret service and clashes have broken out. Mr Mugabe refuses to grant compensation to the white farmers, saying it should come from Britain.</p> <p><b>What is the pattern of land ownership?</b><br> About 4,500 white farmers own 11m hectares of Zimbabwe's prime agricultural land, while about 1m blacks own 16 million hectares, often in drought-prone regions. Where they do exist side by side, huge, modern, mechanised estates are divided by a mere fence from subsistence farmers living in mud huts. The situation dates back to colonial times when blacks were forced off their ancestral lands. In the current crisis, about 600 white-owned farms have been occupied by a mixture of war veterans, unemployed urban youths and peasants.</p> <p><b>How is the economy doing?</b><br> Inflation is running at 60%, unemployment at 50% and there are severe shortages of fuel. A big drain on resources is the civil war in Congo, where the president, Laurent Kabila, is fighting rebels backed by Uganda and Rwanda. Harare has devoted 11,000 troops to shore up Mr Kabila - at a cost of about \u00a31m a day. From being the \"hope of Africa\", Zimbabwe is sinking into poverty.

Now they faced \"serious, perhaps even catastrophic, decline\". Some scientists who have specialised in the area estimate that populations of some species of shark have dropped by 80%. </p> <p>Benchley believes that sharks get a bad press, compared to the dolphin and the whale, because they are not \"cute\", do not appear to \"talk\" to one another and so are harder for people to identify with. There has been no \"save the shark\" campaign and if the creatures appear on T-shirts it is as a joke rather than a plea for their survival. </p> <p>The World Wide Fund for Nature is also anxious about the dramatic decline of shark populations.

      "body": "<p>After my mother's funeral, my sisters and I sat in a Japanese restaurant, three middle-aged orphans sniffing over the sushi. We were middle-aged before this small, stubborn, sexy woman dropped out of our lives. But motherhood carves a space in time where the child who was once the wonder of the world can stay forever young. Only a month before, when my mother was dying, I dashed in to see her after a hellish day's work. Her face creased with concern. \"Oh, you're tired,\" she said. \"Look at your poor little dotey face!\" </p> <p>On her deathbed, she looked like a stranger. After more than 50 years of passionate motherhood, she had handed in her cards. As pain and love and worry left her face, she seemed as serene and selfish as a cat. One got the feeling that she was suddenly fed up with the whole enterprise, that she was off to live her own life now. </p> <p>People try to reclaim the dead with anecdotes, but as we swapped stories about our childhood, a peculiar truth emerged. It became clear that we were each talking about a different person. To each of us, she had been a different mother. She had allotted separate roles to every daughter. Anne was the capable one, on whom she depended. Patricia was the sister in whom she confided. I was the baby whom she would keep for herself. </p> <p>It came as a shock to think that I had never really known her. I had just known \"mother\". She was the only person I have ever met whose face actually lit up when she saw me. She was my life's biggest influence. She was the woman who had bred me to be her second chance - her replacement self. If I did not know her, then how could I know myself? </p> <p>Years ago, I remember feeling startled when a close friend told me that the death of my mother would bring a sense of release. </p> <p>Yes, there was relief she was now free from suffering, but when the first stunned feeling of grief began to recede, there was another, slightly shameful, sensation. Apart from a blinding rush of love, which had been largely inaccessible in her lifetime, I felt the stirring of a sense of freedom. Now I could stand on my own two feet. Now I could find out who I was. Now I could find out who she was. </p> <p>Towards the end of her life, she said that if she had her time over again, she wouldn't have children. \"Children use up your life,\" she said. \"If I had another chance, I'd focus on a career.\" </p> <p>But Nicola Horlick had children, I thought; Mary Robinson, Margaret Thatcher. It wasn't the having of the children, nor even the raising. It was the intense focus she brought to the job, the determination to live her life through them, to fulfil in them her own ambitions. </p> <p>My mother was one of a generation of women who were like Chinese intellectuals in the reign of Mao Zedong, silenced and sentenced to peasant work. An avid reader, a free and radical thinker, she liked bohemian dress and food and interesting conversation, accompanied by cigarette smoke and cocktails. She had no education and no money. She did what nearly all of her generation did - found a man, got married and went into domestic service for a husband and family. </p> <p>Ma wanted to be a writer. She wrote several novels and hundreds of short pieces, most of which were published. But she did not have a career. Her writing was a covert thing, while her husband was at work, when the children were in bed, after the dishes were done. </p> <p>Why writing? Because (like most writers) she wanted to wield her influence on her own terms. For this her family was also a perfect forum - three wide-eyed little girls who believed that she was wise and wonderful, that she had been (as she claimed) a peerless femme fatale, until subdued by family life. </p> <p>But despite her claim that all she ever wanted in life was to have children of her own, she became increasingly depressed. Eventually the writing stopped. She claimed that a psychiatrist who had treated her depression had told her to stop writing for the good of her mental health. As this was in the early 1960s, it was probably true. </p> <p>From the time I was nine or 10, she focused her ambition on me. If I expressed an opinion, she'd say, \"Write it down.\" That I did what she set out to do was only a partial triumph. It upset her when I turned up to visit, dressed in standard literary kit of stretch leggings, fleece jackets and trainers. Was that all I/she had to show for it? She would have liked me to be like Jackie Collins, with a fox fur and false eyelashes. Then everyone would know I was a success. And, although she took pleasure in my books, she would sometimes suggest, as tactfully as possible, that it was time I wrote something popular. She could not understand what had gone wrong. She had inadvertently turned me into that most unglamorous of creatures - a committed writer. What she had wanted for her daughter/herself was a career in which there was money and respect, but, most importantly, a place in the limelight. </p> <p>In The Second Sex, Simone de Beauvoir wrote of the hazards for a woman in trying to make her daughter her replacement. \"The double is a dubious personage, who assassinates the original, as we see, for example, in Poe's tales and in Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray. Thus, in becoming a woman, the daughter condemns her mother to death. . .\" </p> <p>From the time I entered my teens, a battle of wills commenced. She furiously tried to force feed me all that was important to her - religion, feminism, a mistrust of men. I furiously resisted, flinging it all back in her face, like a toddler, splattering back the mashed carrots. The uneasy, exhausting, although deeply loving, relationship masked a terror in each of us. If we failed in our separate struggles, then one of us must disappear. </p> <p>When she was old, she often talked about her grief and disappointment that children grow up and leave you (although she sometimes said that \"children turn against you\"). \"I think it's a pretty fair bargain,\" I'd say. \"Children love you unconditionally for at least seven years. That's more than you get out of most love affairs.\" </p> <p>\"You haven't got children,\" she'd say. \"You don't know what love is like.\" </p> <p>\"But you left your mother,\" I'd argue. \"You must have known your children would have to leave.\" She shook her head, totally unable to accept that what she had made with her body and her will might be at the disposal of others. </p> <p>Now that she has gone, I have to look at the space she occupied and the gap left behind. I no longer see her as the disappointed old lady nor the passionate, ambitious mother, but a lost girl. She was very pretty when young and she entered into motherhood with such pure delight and generosity that women who were once children on our street still talk of how they loved to come to our house, where they were allowed to make sweets or cakes or do anything they liked. Studying her photographs now, I am amazed that she looked as innocent at 80 as at 18. </p> <p>I miss her more than I can say. I miss the hug we always had after we'd been to lunch. She did not embrace me but waited for her hug and then rested mutely in my arms, in the way a dog does. \"Ah, that's nice,\" she'd say. </p> <p>Now that she has gone, I can clearly see the real and enormous influence she effected. She made me feel that I was capable of anything and worthy of love. That I became a writer is not only due to her, but also to other influential relationships. But the kind of writer I became is all her own work. In the end, the relationship, which dominated much of my life, became the substance and motivation of my fiction. All of my books, in one way or another, concern mothers and daughters. Even my latest novel, Beloved Stranger, which set out as an analysis of marriage, turned into a voyage of discovery for a married woman and her unmarried daughter. </p> <p>The relationship of motherhood is not the one of tender sentiment portrayed by Victorians, nor a cosy girlie friendship, but a briefly perfect love affair that becomes, as Anne Leaton puts it in the anthology Mothers by Daughters \"a closed door through which others may not enter\". But as the lifelong struggle for influence on the mother's part and approval on the daughter's part comes to a close, one finally appreciates the sheer spiritual intensity of the union. </p> <p>Soon after my mother died, I sat down and read again through the letters of sympathy I had had, many of them from women. They were not so much saying they were sorry for my loss, as wailing about the loss of their own mothers. \"I don't think you ever get over the death of your mother,\" one woman wrote. \"Another talked of how, years later, she still misses her: \"And she seems to be around quite a lot still - it's rather as if she's in another town and we hadn't visited recently.\" </p> <p>I don't feel that Ma's in another town.

      "bodyText": "After my mother's funeral, my sisters and I sat in a Japanese restaurant, three middle-aged orphans sniffing over the sushi. We were middle-aged before this small, stubborn, sexy woman dropped out of our lives. But motherhood carves a space in time where the child who was once the wonder of the world can stay forever young. Only a month before, when my mother was dying, I dashed in to see her after a hellish day's work. Her face creased with concern. \"Oh, you're tired,\" she said. \"Look at your poor little dotey face!\" On her deathbed, she looked like a stranger. After more than 50 years of passionate motherhood, she had handed in her cards. As pain and love and worry left her face, she seemed as serene and selfish as a cat. One got the feeling that she was suddenly fed up with the whole enterprise, that she was off to live her own life now. People try to reclaim the dead with anecdotes, but as we swapped stories about our childhood, a peculiar truth emerged. It became clear that we were each talking about a different person. To each of us, she had been a different mother. She had allotted separate roles to every daughter. Anne was the capable one, on whom she depended. Patricia was the sister in whom she confided. I was the baby whom she would keep for herself. It came as a shock to think that I had never really known her. I had just known \"mother\". She was the only person I have ever met whose face actually lit up when she saw me. She was my life's biggest influence.

Some have already seen years of retrenchment as more and more people have gone without, or crossed to neighbouring areas to get the services they need, and central government grant has been cut. Best Value will find these services so bad that local electors will cry out for their council to be abolished.</p> <p>The good councils will be forced to put more and more services in the hands of other \"providers\". The requirement for a mixed economy will have the same effect across all services as we already see in those which the Tories forced councils to put out to tender, such as council tax collection and housing benefit payments. A small number of very large firms will quickly grow huge profits, on the backs of former council staff, and quietly fail to deliver. In most places, these firms have recruited new starters at wages so low that councils cannot afford the increase in costs of bringing the work back in and paying staff now at the private sector's mercy.</p> <p>Who will want to be a councillor, a mere superintendent of continued decline into squalor, is another matter. <br><b>Tom Snow</b><br>London</p> <p>\u0095 I will soon be standing down after nine years as a city councillor, the last two as social services committee chair. Throughout this time government ministers have criticised local government, although earlier onslaughts have thankfully diminished. In their place is a ministerial view closer to that attributed by Richard Crossman to his permanent secretary, Dame Evelyn Sharp: \"Wanting improvement and social justice quite passionately and yet a tremendous patrician... regarding local authorities as children which she has to examine and rebuke for their failures\".</p> <p>With the current managerial approach to government it is essential that public deliberation over decisions is not replaced by centrally imposed targets and performance indicators. The search for quality and national standards is all well and good, but the achievement of this will ultimately depend upon effective organisational forms at local level. This must include genuine democratic processes. Institutional sclerosis has developed in parts of local government, and new forms of public engagement need to be found. This cannot be achieved by central directive.</p> <p>During my time as a councillor I have worked with colleagues who have shown enormous commitment to improving local services, often in the face of enormous obstacles. Criticising people such as these as part of the problem simply makes solutions more difficult to find.<br><b>Dr Mike Sheaff<br></b>University of Plymouth<br>M.Sheaff@plymouth.ac.uk</p> <p>\u0095 Underlying Sir Jeremy Beecham's fears about creeping centralisation lies another story of persistent underfunding and neglect. The Local Government Association has calculated that the chancellor needs to find another \u00a39bn to bring local government services up to scratch.

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Beecham's muted defence of local government (Warning shots from the frontline, March 31) is mounted from almost the last barricade. He well knows that New Labour's concept of Best Value will soon produce measures of how well each council is doing in delivering central government policy. Some have already seen years of retrenchment as more and more people have gone without, or crossed to neighbouring areas to get the services they need, and central government grant has been cut. Best Value will find these services so bad that local electors will cry out for their council to be abolished. The good councils will be forced to put more and more services in the hands of other \"providers\". The requirement for a mixed economy will have the same effect across all services as we already see in those which the Tories forced councils to put out to tender, such as council tax collection and housing benefit payments. A small number of very large firms will quickly grow huge profits, on the backs of former council staff, and quietly fail to deliver. In most places, these firms have recruited new starters at wages so low that councils cannot afford the increase in costs of bringing the work back in and paying staff now at the private sector's mercy. Who will want to be a councillor, a mere superintendent of continued decline into squalor, is another matter. Tom Snow London \u0095 I will soon be standing down after nine years as a city councillor, the last two as social services committee chair. Throughout this time government ministers have criticised local government, although earlier onslaughts have thankfully diminished. In their place is a ministerial view closer to that attributed by Richard Crossman to his permanent secretary, Dame Evelyn Sharp: \"Wanting improvement and social justice quite passionately and yet a tremendous patrician... regarding local authorities as children which she has to examine and rebuke for their failures\". With the current managerial approach to government it is essential that public deliberation over decisions is not replaced by centrally imposed targets and performance indicators. The search for quality and national standards is all well and good, but the achievement of this will ultimately depend upon effective organisational forms at local level. This must include genuine democratic processes. Institutional sclerosis has developed in parts of local government, and new forms of public engagement need to be found. This cannot be achieved by central directive. During my time as a councillor I have worked with colleagues who have shown enormous commitment to improving local services, often in the face of enormous obstacles. Criticising people such as these as part of the problem simply makes solutions more difficult to find. Dr Mike Sheaff University of Plymouth M.Sheaff@plymouth.ac.uk \u0095 Underlying Sir Jeremy Beecham's fears about creeping centralisation lies another story of persistent underfunding and neglect. The Local Government Association has calculated that the chancellor needs to find another \u00a39bn to bring local government services up to scratch. Staff at the cutting edge are only too aware that the rhetoric of quality services has hidden another agenda of cuts, competition and privatisation. It was Nicholas Ridley who first floated the notion of the \"enabling authority\", where services are bought in and the private sector reaps the profit. What is needed now is a commitment to a real investment in the frontline. The democratic vision of top quality services delivered through creative local leadership can be realised - but only if central government is prepared to commit both resources and trust.

Mr Cook, speaking on the eve of the European Union-African summit in Cairo, criticised Zimbabwe's police for failing to protect the demonstrators and called on Mr Mugabe to honour a promise to set a date for a general election. Mr Mugabe, dispelling initial doubts about whether he would attend the summit, left Harare for Cairo last night. The Foreign Office said a discussion between Mr Cook and Mr Mugabe would not be possible last night but, as the two men would be sitting near each other during the summit, it was likely to take place today or tomorrow. The proximity of the two teams is a potential flashpoint, given the strong language being used by both during the past fortnight of unrest in Zimbabwe. Mr Mugabe left behind an increasingly fraught country. Fifteen people were injured on Saturday when 150 people, alleged to be linked to his party, Zanu-PF, forcefully broke up a march comprising 4,000 peaceful demonstrators in the capital, Harare. And the tension is set to increase: a coalition of Zimbabwean civic groups vowed yesterday to intensify demonstrations to press Mr Mugabe to uphold the rule of law. In the aftermath of Saturday's march, Mr Cook issued an uncompromising statement yesterday morning criticising Mr Mugabe's regime, which he expanded on during interviews throughout the day. He accused Mr Mugabe of flouting his own courts and chastising Britain in an attempt to win re-election. He expressed concern about delayed parliamentary elections, initially scheduled for April but now though to be set for July, and the failure of police to protect demonstrators or carry out court orders to stop the illegal occupation of white-owned farms by Zimbabwe's black veterans of the Rhodesian war against white rule in the 70s. The Foreign Office conceded last night that the issue of Zimbabwe was unlikely to be raised officially by Mr Cook at the summit, which begins today, claiming the meeting was about \"sectoral\" rather than specific issues. The Belgian foreign minister, Louis Michel, hinted that putting Zimbabwe on the agenda would open a can of worms. He said the summit, the first between the EU and Africa, would then face the prospect of every crisis in Africa being raised in future. Instead, Mr Cook will raise Zimbabwe at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg next Monday. He will urge the EU to \"offer election-monitoring officials to help establish that the forthcoming elections in Zimbabwe are free and fair\". Mr Mugabe devoted much of a speech on Friday to criticising Britain's involvement in Zimbabwe's internal affairs. An uncompromising Mr Cook said: \"I very much regret that President Mugabe ap pears to have based his pitch for re-election on attacking Britain. He has now been in power for 17 years and he has to accept himself the responsibility for the current state of the economy of Zimbabwe.\" In Harare, opponents of Mr Mugabe promised further protests. \"For the next 100 days we will organise public demonstrations to promote peace and the rule of law,\" said Brian Kagoro, spokesman for the National Constitutional Assembly, which organised Saturday's ill-fated march. \"We cannot accept the government's violent intimidation.\" More than a dozen people ended up in hospital.

Madagascar's meteorological office said Cyclone Hudah covered hundreds of square miles and was thought likely to bring winds of 200 mph when it hit the very area in the north-east of the Indian Ocean island which was severely damaged by cyclones Eline and Gloria in late February and early March. The two earlier cyclones caused considerable damage and loss of life, killing more than 200 people in mudslides, destroying tens of thousands of homes and leaving about 130,000 people dependent on food aid. Radio Madagascar yesterday broadcast warnings to residents of the main towns in its path, principally the country's largest port, Toamasina, to shore up their homes or take shelter in brick buildings. It is too early to say whether Cyclone Hudah poses a severe threat to Mozambique. Large parts of the centre and south of the country are still under water after two months of storms and overflowing rivers. The previous cyclones developed in different ways after hitting Madagascar: Eline retained much of its force and went on to batter Mozambique's coast. Gloria largely dissipated, but still dumped heavy rains on southern Africa. The principal danger is not from Cyclone Hudah's winds, but that more rain flowing into the region's swollen rivers - especially the Limpopo and Incomati - will wash down to the parts of Mozambique hit by flooding. It could compound the considerable damage done by rains in northern parts of South Africa and southern Zimbabwe. Several hundred people drowned in the floods in Mozambique, although the final death toll will not be known until after the waters have receded.

The World Bank estimates that damage to Mozambique's agriculture, roads and manufacturing industry will cost the country about US$1bn (\u00a3625m) in relief and reconstruction costs. About 600,000 people are dependent on food aid. More than 250,000 are housed in temporary camps.

      "body": "<p>Once we believed that one of the advantages of interactive media would be that the audience would be measurable to the last infinitesimal detail - and then sliced, diced, dissected and reaggregated to suit any marketing strategy. How wrong we were. We can't even count the number of people who look at the Guardian's home page. The only thing of which we can be certain is the behaviour of those who register on the site. The practical problems are multiple: no one has yet worked out how to count the exact number of internet users, of websites, of visits to websites, of emails or even of the total amount of information flowing around the net. </p> <p>In a way this is a testament to the glorious anarchy of the internet. But measurement is going on, however unreliable, and the ethical issue of what happens to the resulting information is becoming more pressing as sophistication increases. </p> <p>The difficulty with accurately counting the number of visitors to websites (and therefore the amount advertisers should pay) is caused by proxy servers, computers which are scattered about on the internet like radio booster stations. They allow internet service providers (ISPs) to give customers a much faster service, while simultaneously reducing the requirement for bandwidth needed to route the information around the internet. If many people are asking for the same web page it will be automatically stored on a proxy server. </p> <p>At the biggest ISPs, such as AOL or Cambridge University, this means that a proxy server will register only one download from a given site, even though dozens or perhaps hundreds of people have called up the page. </p> <p>There are complex arrays of proxy servers, which means that a single web page might be stored on multiple machines - the logo on one, text on another, audio on a third machine and so on. It has been impossible to count users of proxy servers without direct access to their log files, which are held by the owner of the server. </p> <p>The number of users registered with a website might seem like a better statistic to hang on to. Once someone has registered it is much easier to follow his or her behaviour. Registration is not a panacea, however. Companies float on the stock exchange claiming they have \"a million subscribers\", and are valued on that basis. But how many of these subscribers are duplicates, or people who haven't bought anything? </p> <p>Services such as Nielsen Netratings and MMX employ a traditional approach involving panels of users to count the number of viewers of the top few hundred websites. The highly fragmented website market means the panels cannot be used to monitor the whole net. There are too many sites which receive less than 0.1% of the audience. </p> <p>Other services monitor changes in the usage of hardware and software. Network Wizards and Statmarket in the US and Netcraft in the UK all publish data on the types of servers on the Internet, the amount of traffic they have monitored and so on. </p> <p>For intensive tracking, expensive \"content management\" software such as Broadvision or Vignette can tail users. Broadvision has an \"observation engine\" which monitors individual progress through all stages of a site from browsing to purchase. The Microsoft Commerce server with personalisation and membership has the advantage of costing only $10,000 (about \u00a36,000) plus about $50,000 to customise. It has the disadvantage that it only works with Microsoft products. </p> <p>Most of the services count only the top few hundred sites. What is needed now is an internet equivalent of the National Readership Survey which uses tried and trusted survey techniques to quantify national surfing habits. Only then will advertisers and publishers have data on which to base proper planning. </p> <p>It is easy to forget that the web is not the internet - many use email without using the web. And email has become an important advertising and direct response tool. Amazing amounts of customer information can be collected from electronic direct marketing systems. Kana Connect, for example, can track a vast amount of information on recipients, including whether they open messages, click on links or make purchases. By tracking responses and transactions on an individual level, companies pinpoint valuable customers and determine how best to reach them in the future. </p> <p>Kana can also be used to analyse the effectiveness of the customer support operation - such as average response times, message volume and individual or team performance levels - which leads to ethical questions about the use of the data that can now be collected. </p> <p>The right to privacy is already being stretched by leading internet companies.

      "bodyText": "Once we believed that one of the advantages of interactive media would be that the audience would be measurable to the last infinitesimal detail - and then sliced, diced, dissected and reaggregated to suit any marketing strategy. How wrong we were. We can't even count the number of people who look at the Guardian's home page. The only thing of which we can be certain is the behaviour of those who register on the site. The practical problems are multiple: no one has yet worked out how to count the exact number of internet users, of websites, of visits to websites, of emails or even of the total amount of information flowing around the net. In a way this is a testament to the glorious anarchy of the internet. But measurement is going on, however unreliable, and the ethical issue of what happens to the resulting information is becoming more pressing as sophistication increases. The difficulty with accurately counting the number of visitors to websites (and therefore the amount advertisers should pay) is caused by proxy servers, computers which are scattered about on the internet like radio booster stations. They allow internet service providers (ISPs) to give customers a much faster service, while simultaneously reducing the requirement for bandwidth needed to route the information around the internet. If many people are asking for the same web page it will be automatically stored on a proxy server. At the biggest ISPs, such as AOL or Cambridge University, this means that a proxy server will register only one download from a given site, even though dozens or perhaps hundreds of people have called up the page. There are complex arrays of proxy servers, which means that a single web page might be stored on multiple machines - the logo on one, text on another, audio on a third machine and so on. It has been impossible to count users of proxy servers without direct access to their log files, which are held by the owner of the server. The number of users registered with a website might seem like a better statistic to hang on to. Once someone has registered it is much easier to follow his or her behaviour. Registration is not a panacea, however. Companies float on the stock exchange claiming they have \"a million subscribers\", and are valued on that basis. But how many of these subscribers are duplicates, or people who haven't bought anything? Services such as Nielsen Netratings and MMX employ a traditional approach involving panels of users to count the number of viewers of the top few hundred websites. The highly fragmented website market means the panels cannot be used to monitor the whole net. There are too many sites which receive less than 0.1% of the audience. Other services monitor changes in the usage of hardware and software. Network Wizards and Statmarket in the US and Netcraft in the UK all publish data on the types of servers on the Internet, the amount of traffic they have monitored and so on. For intensive tracking, expensive \"content management\" software such as Broadvision or Vignette can tail users. Broadvision has an \"observation engine\" which monitors individual progress through all stages of a site from browsing to purchase. The Microsoft Commerce server with personalisation and membership has the advantage of costing only $10,000 (about \u00a36,000) plus about $50,000 to customise. It has the disadvantage that it only works with Microsoft products. Most of the services count only the top few hundred sites. What is needed now is an internet equivalent of the National Readership Survey which uses tried and trusted survey techniques to quantify national surfing habits. Only then will advertisers and publishers have data on which to base proper planning. It is easy to forget that the web is not the internet - many use email without using the web. And email has become an important advertising and direct response tool. Amazing amounts of customer information can be collected from electronic direct marketing systems. Kana Connect, for example, can track a vast amount of information on recipients, including whether they open messages, click on links or make purchases. By tracking responses and transactions on an individual level, companies pinpoint valuable customers and determine how best to reach them in the future. Kana can also be used to analyse the effectiveness of the customer support operation - such as average response times, message volume and individual or team performance levels - which leads to ethical questions about the use of the data that can now be collected. The right to privacy is already being stretched by leading internet companies. Amazon, the online bookshop, caused protests last year when it released very limited details of the book-buying habits of small groups, such as Microsoft employees. In the US, courts are examining some of the issues. Employers worry about \"time-theft\" as staff shop for groceries online in office hours. Staff believe that their digital personality belongs to them, not to their employer - but can they choose to go ex-directory?

      "bodyText": "Way back in the days of the cold war, popular wisdom had it that a pair of Levi 501s could get you a bigger flat and a brand new Trabant on the other side of the Iron Curtain. A good deal for the jeans trader, you might think. In fact, he woz robbed. Consider the case of the woman who went to Siberia to adopt a baby, but found herself faced with a belligerent Russian official and a shortage of cash. Her way to grease the wheels? Offer him a packet of Post-it Notes. Much to her amazement, it worked. There are many strange tales surrounding obscure pieces of office equipment, but this must be one of the strangest. Certainly few would dispute the value of little repositionable memos - how else would one attach abusive messages to a colleague's computer screen? But a bargaining tool for a child? Post-it Notes truth is almost stranger than fiction, however. The inventor of the \"low-tack\" notepad, an American scientist called Art Fry, might even ascribe his discovery to divine inspiration, since he hit on the idea while singing in his local church choir. A meticulous chap, Art would mark each week's hymns in his song book, but found that the markers kept falling out. \"I thought, what I really need is a bookmark that would attach and detach lightly, wouldn't fall off but wouldn't hurt the hymnal either,\" he recalled recently. Must have been a particularly boring sermon. On Wednesday, Post-its will celebrate their 20th anniversary, and while the little sticky labels are now available in 30 different colours, the original shade of pale yellow is still the most popular. This was first chosen because they were originally intended to be the same shade as legal notepads. Lawyers, the manufacturers clearly reckoned, had more cause to leave abusive messages than the rest of us.",

Translating the theory into practice is quite a different matter. There was no sign, for example, of any Third Way guru in Birmingham on Saturday to explain \"rights and responsibilities\" to those protesting about what has happened at Longbridge. As far as the Rover workers are concerned, you don't need to be a philosopher king to understand that in a world of footloose capital, BMW has the rights and Rover workers bear the responsibility. </p> <p>An even more egregious example of the shortcomings of \"rights and responsibilities\" comes from the failure of the rich creditor nations and the multilateral institutions to make good their pledges on debt relief. With a few striking exceptions, developing countries have put their economies in order, have pledged to use debt relief on anti-poverty programmes, and have agreed to independent auditing to ensure that funds do not end up in Swiss bank accounts. So, plenty of responsibility. Now they expect something in return. </p> <p>Sadly, this is not happening. Amid an orgy of self-congratulation last year, world leaders announced that the original heavily indebted poor country initiative was too limited and too slow. The answer was HIPC2, which would be faster, more generous and apply to more countries. But nine months on from the Cologne G7 summit and six months after the details were sorted out at the annual meetings of the World Bank and the IMF, it is clear that the souped-up HIPC2 looks very much like HIPC1. </p> <p>In Britain, at least, alarm bells have started to ring. At the end of last year, the chancellor, Gordon Brown, said he hoped to see four countries through HIPC2 by the end of January, 11 by Easter and 26 by the end of the year. Not a single country had been granted debt relief by the end of January, only three have received it now and a maximum of five will have been processed by the time of the spring meeting of the World Bank and the IMF later this month. Brown and Clare Short, the development secretary, accept that at the present rate of progress there is not a chance of getting two-thirds of the 41 eligible countries into the process by the end of the year. </p> <p>Brown and Short are not to blame for this. Indeed, Britain's record on debt relief - under the Conservatives as well as Labour - has been admirable. The real problem is in Washington, where the attempts of the US treasury to throw sand in the wheels of the HIPC process are being aided by the institutional torpor and rigidity of the World Bank and the IMF. As an added complication, it is Japan's turn to chair the G7 this year, and Tokyo had to be dragged kicking and screaming into supporting HIPC2. </p> <p>The danger now is that the whole process starts to unravel. Japan has put a miserly $10m into the HIPC trust fund, which is supposed to be raising cash so that the World Bank and the regional development banks can write off their share of the debts owed by some of the world's poorest countries. The Clinton administration has only managed to persuade Congress to stump up two-thirds of the $600m pledged by the White House last year, and until it does the European Union will not release the $1bn it agreed to find from the European development fund. </p> <p>Later this month, there will be an op portunity for another bout of rich-country grandstanding at the UN conference on education in Senegal, when fountain pens will be flourished with \u00e9lan so that politicians can sign up to targets for ensuring primary education for every child on the planet by 2015. But at the moment this looks like a case of putting the cart a long way before the horse. </p> <p>Debt relief is obviously not the only factor necessary for developing countries to build up a basic social infrastructure, but it is a key ingredient in any realistic package. As the UN secretary general Kofi Annan says today: \"Let us be clear that without a convincing programme of debt relief to start the new millennium, our objective of halving world poverty by 2015 will be only a pipe dream.\" </p> <p><strong> Dying on its feet</strong><br> </p> <p>Jubilee 2000 says that the five countries that will have scraped through HIPC2 by Easter - Uganda, Bolivia, Mauritania, Mozambique and Tanzania - will have had their debt burden reduced by 40% on average rather than the 90-100% write off that was promised. The quintet will still be paying more than half a billion dollars every year to foreign creditors - almost as much as they spend on healthcare. Uganda has one of the highest levels of HIV infection in the world, which has already orphaned 1m children. In Bolivia, 60% of the population has no access to basic sanitation; Mauritania has an adult literacy rate of 62%. Everybody knows what has been happening in Mozambique. Try telling the people there about rights and responsibilities. </p> <p>Finding a way out of this mess does not require rocket science. Clare Short has been warning for months that the HIPC2 process has been dying on its feet because countries are being forced to submit absurdly detailed anti-poverty programmes before they secure debt relief. She says that all countries need at the outset is a rudimentary road map, and that the rest can be inked in later. </p> <p>The Americans seem intent on slowing up HIPC2 at every turn. While the Clinton administration has made the right noises about debt relief publicly, inside the Bank and the IMF it has been pernickety about conditions that countries will have to abide by if they are to receive debt relief, arguing that states should have poverty reduction plans in place for a year before anything happens. </p> <p>Campaigners say that one of the other great breakthroughs proclaimed last year - full consultation with civil society over poverty reduction strategy papers (PRSP) - has proved to be a bit of a joke. \"The IMF told Mozambique and Mauritania that they could obtain rapid approval for debt relief under HIPC only if they did not put the PRSP out for public consultation.\" </p> <p>As things stand, only 14 countries are likely to qualify for HIPC2 debt relief this year. Clearly this is nowhere near good enough, and it is now time for the Jubilee 2000 campaign, the churches and the others to help Brown and Short put pressure on the laggards among the G7 later this month. </p> <p>Annan will throw his full weight behind the campaign to speed-up HIPC2 today, with a call for donor countries and the international financial institutions to consider wiping off their books all official debts of the heavily indebted poor countries in return for those countries making demonstrable commitments to poverty reduction. He will also outline a new approach under which there would be immediate cancellation of the debts owed by countries that have suffered major conflicts or natural disasters, expanding the number of countries in the HIPC scheme by allowing them to qualify on grounds of poverty alone, pegging debt repayments at a maximum percentage of foreign exchange earnings, and establishing a debt arbitration process to balance the interests of creditors and sovereign debtors and introduce greater discipline into their relations. </p> <p>But none of this will happen without political will. Now is the time for some real leadership that accepts that everybody has the right to clean water, basic healthcare and an education, and those with the power and financial clout have a responsibility to ensure that they get them. </p>",

Brown and Short are not to blame for this. Indeed, Britain's record on debt relief - under the Conservatives as well as Labour - has been admirable. The real problem is in Washington, where the attempts of the US treasury to throw sand in the wheels of the HIPC process are being aided by the institutional torpor and rigidity of the World Bank and the IMF. As an added complication, it is Japan's turn to chair the G7 this year, and Tokyo had to be dragged kicking and screaming into supporting HIPC2. The danger now is that the whole process starts to unravel. Japan has put a miserly $10m into the HIPC trust fund, which is supposed to be raising cash so that the World Bank and the regional development banks can write off their share of the debts owed by some of the world's poorest countries. The Clinton administration has only managed to persuade Congress to stump up two-thirds of the $600m pledged by the White House last year, and until it does the European Union will not release the $1bn it agreed to find from the European development fund. Later this month, there will be an op portunity for another bout of rich-country grandstanding at the UN conference on education in Senegal, when fountain pens will be flourished with \u00e9lan so that politicians can sign up to targets for ensuring primary education for every child on the planet by 2015. But at the moment this looks like a case of putting the cart a long way before the horse. Debt relief is obviously not the only factor necessary for developing countries to build up a basic social infrastructure, but it is a key ingredient in any realistic package. As the UN secretary general Kofi Annan says today: \"Let us be clear that without a convincing programme of debt relief to start the new millennium, our objective of halving world poverty by 2015 will be only a pipe dream.\" Dying on its feet Jubilee 2000 says that the five countries that will have scraped through HIPC2 by Easter - Uganda, Bolivia, Mauritania, Mozambique and Tanzania - will have had their debt burden reduced by 40% on average rather than the 90-100% write off that was promised. The quintet will still be paying more than half a billion dollars every year to foreign creditors - almost as much as they spend on healthcare. Uganda has one of the highest levels of HIV infection in the world, which has already orphaned 1m children. In Bolivia, 60% of the population has no access to basic sanitation; Mauritania has an adult literacy rate of 62%. Everybody knows what has been happening in Mozambique. Try telling the people there about rights and responsibilities. Finding a way out of this mess does not require rocket science. Clare Short has been warning for months that the HIPC2 process has been dying on its feet because countries are being forced to submit absurdly detailed anti-poverty programmes before they secure debt relief. She says that all countries need at the outset is a rudimentary road map, and that the rest can be inked in later. The Americans seem intent on slowing up HIPC2 at every turn. While the Clinton administration has made the right noises about debt relief publicly, inside the Bank and the IMF it has been pernickety about conditions that countries will have to abide by if they are to receive debt relief, arguing that states should have poverty reduction plans in place for a year before anything happens. Campaigners say that one of the other great breakthroughs proclaimed last year - full consultation with civil society over poverty reduction strategy papers (PRSP) - has proved to be a bit of a joke. \"The IMF told Mozambique and Mauritania that they could obtain rapid approval for debt relief under HIPC only if they did not put the PRSP out for public consultation.\" As things stand, only 14 countries are likely to qualify for HIPC2 debt relief this year. Clearly this is nowhere near good enough, and it is now time for the Jubilee 2000 campaign, the churches and the others to help Brown and Short put pressure on the laggards among the G7 later this month. Annan will throw his full weight behind the campaign to speed-up HIPC2 today, with a call for donor countries and the international financial institutions to consider wiping off their books all official debts of the heavily indebted poor countries in return for those countries making demonstrable commitments to poverty reduction. He will also outline a new approach under which there would be immediate cancellation of the debts owed by countries that have suffered major conflicts or natural disasters, expanding the number of countries in the HIPC scheme by allowing them to qualify on grounds of poverty alone, pegging debt repayments at a maximum percentage of foreign exchange earnings, and establishing a debt arbitration process to balance the interests of creditors and sovereign debtors and introduce greater discipline into their relations. But none of this will happen without political will. Now is the time for some real leadership that accepts that everybody has the right to clean water, basic healthcare and an education, and those with the power and financial clout have a responsibility to ensure that they get them.",

      "body": "<p>Pop into your local supermarket and along with the loo rolls and baked beans you may soon be able to pick up tips on how to deal with the noisy neighbours or what to do about the bully at work.</p> <p>Under a pilot scheme run by the East Riding of Yorkshire council, shoppers at Safeway in Willerby will have the chance from this summer to put their legal problems to a network of solicitors, citizens advice bureaux, Humberside law centre, the local council and voluntary services through an interactive kiosk. A video-link will allow them to discuss their problem face-to-face with an advice worker.</p> <p>Another kiosk to be set up in the village square at Easingham, a remote coastal village, will link people with the advice services which cluster in towns. The project, supported by a grant of \u00a3500,000 from the lord chancellor's department, has been spawned by a partnership between the local authority, solicitors, advice agencies and government as part of the new Community Legal Service. The project could provide a blueprint for advice services nationwide.</p> <p>Around the country, partnerships have been coming up with bright ideas since they were launched in the first six pioneer areas - Kirklees, Liverpool, Norwich, Nottinghamshire, Southwark and Cornwall - in December 1998. The Community Legal Service will be officially launched at 11 o'clock this morning when Cherie Booth presses a button and its impressive website, www. justask.org.uk, goes live.</p> <p>The new service has not been widely heralded but it marks a revolution in the way publicly funded legal services are delivered. Some 50 years after its birth, legal aid has been abolished, though the term will no doubt take time to die out. The legal aid board has been replaced by the Legal Services Commission. Through the commission, the Community Legal Service will deliver advice, help and representation in civil cases.</p> <p>If you need help with a court case, you will no longer get legal aid, but \"litigation funding\". The changes are not just semantic. Public funds will no longer act as what the lord chancellor's department minister David Lock calls \"a subsidy for ad hoc private litigation\".</p> <p>The government will no longer bankroll lawyers to do the work that lawyers want to do. Instead, the aim will be to deliver the services people need, through lawyers in private practice but also through skilled advice workers. With hindsight, the original legal aid scheme was too legalistic, too focussed on court-based solutions. Under the old scheme, if you had a legal problem you could go into any solicitor's office and claim legal aid if you passed the means test. Now only solicitors with a contract or franchise can do state-funded work. Their numbers have dropped from 11,000 or so to only 5,500.</p> <p>Instead of just paying for whatever work lawyers decide to do, the government has set priorities. From April 1, legal aid has been withdrawn from personal injury cases; these will now be handled by lawyers under no-win, no-fee deals. Funding will still be available in most of the traditional fields, including divorce. But priority will be given to social welfare cases, covering people's basic entitlements to social security benefits and a roof over their heads; cases of fundamental importance to the people affected, including adoption, childcare and domestic violence; and cases with a wider public interest, such as challenges to the actions of public bodies.</p> <p>But in local areas partnerships are setting their own priorities. Some areas, as one former minister put it, are advice deserts, others advice mazes. Traditionally, while agencies referred cases to solicitors, few referred clients to other agencies. Whether someone with a problem found the right helper was largely a matter of chance.</p> <p>Last November Paths to Justice, the largest survey of the ways the public tries to solve legal problems, painted a picture of people floundering about trying to find help and often giving up in frustration. The Community Legal Service aims to change that picture. Partnerships now operate in 70 areas, covering one third of the population of England and Wales. By April 2002 the aim is to cover 90%.</p> <p>A key task of partnerships is to set up effective local referral networks so people with problems will end up in the right place, no matter at what point they enter the system. In Derby, Wendy Endsor went to her local law centre when she encountered difficulties at work.</p> <p>\"I worked as an after-sales manager for a company bringing in cars from the Continent. I went off sick to have an operation and was told I would have to work as a receptionist when I came back. The law centre said they couldn't do that - what they were proposing was constructive dismissal. I sent in my notice and said I was leaving due to my demotion.\"</p> <p>Carol Lambert, an advice worker at the law centre, represented her at the tribunal, supervised by Jon Jarvis, a law centre solicitor. Endsor won the case and was pleased to get \u00a32,500 compensation. \"I hadn't really thought about money. I just didn't want them to do to somebody else what they'd done to me.\"</p> <p>Using the Just Ask website's powerful search engine, anyone with a problem will be able to key in a simple cry for help - such as \"I am being evicted. Help me\" - and come up with an answer from among 400 other sites. There is also an electronic directory of 15,000 sources of help including solicitors, advice centres and specialist resources, which will produce a list of the nearest helpers speaking a particular language and knowledgeable about the particular area of law. From today, commuters and shoppers will be able to access the website at TownPages information booths in train stations and supermarkets around the country.</p> <p>Hazel Genn, professor of socio-legal studies at University College, London and author of the Paths to Justice survey, said: \"My book ended by saying there's a huge need for information and help. If the Community Legal Service is capable of delivering early advice so it can get in and knock problems on the head before they become huge, I think it's an incredibly good idea. We will have to watch and see how it's used.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Pop into your local supermarket and along with the loo rolls and baked beans you may soon be able to pick up tips on how to deal with the noisy neighbours or what to do about the bully at work. Under a pilot scheme run by the East Riding of Yorkshire council, shoppers at Safeway in Willerby will have the chance from this summer to put their legal problems to a network of solicitors, citizens advice bureaux, Humberside law centre, the local council and voluntary services through an interactive kiosk. A video-link will allow them to discuss their problem face-to-face with an advice worker. Another kiosk to be set up in the village square at Easingham, a remote coastal village, will link people with the advice services which cluster in towns. The project, supported by a grant of \u00a3500,000 from the lord chancellor's department, has been spawned by a partnership between the local authority, solicitors, advice agencies and government as part of the new Community Legal Service. The project could provide a blueprint for advice services nationwide. Around the country, partnerships have been coming up with bright ideas since they were launched in the first six pioneer areas - Kirklees, Liverpool, Norwich, Nottinghamshire, Southwark and Cornwall - in December 1998. The Community Legal Service will be officially launched at 11 o'clock this morning when Cherie Booth presses a button and its impressive website, www. justask.org.uk, goes live. The new service has not been widely heralded but it marks a revolution in the way publicly funded legal services are delivered. Some 50 years after its birth, legal aid has been abolished, though the term will no doubt take time to die out. The legal aid board has been replaced by the Legal Services Commission. Through the commission, the Community Legal Service will deliver advice, help and representation in civil cases. If you need help with a court case, you will no longer get legal aid, but \"litigation funding\". The changes are not just semantic. Public funds will no longer act as what the lord chancellor's department minister David Lock calls \"a subsidy for ad hoc private litigation\". The government will no longer bankroll lawyers to do the work that lawyers want to do. Instead, the aim will be to deliver the services people need, through lawyers in private practice but also through skilled advice workers. With hindsight, the original legal aid scheme was too legalistic, too focussed on court-based solutions. Under the old scheme, if you had a legal problem you could go into any solicitor's office and claim legal aid if you passed the means test. Now only solicitors with a contract or franchise can do state-funded work. Their numbers have dropped from 11,000 or so to only 5,500. Instead of just paying for whatever work lawyers decide to do, the government has set priorities. From April 1, legal aid has been withdrawn from personal injury cases; these will now be handled by lawyers under no-win, no-fee deals. Funding will still be available in most of the traditional fields, including divorce. But priority will be given to social welfare cases, covering people's basic entitlements to social security benefits and a roof over their heads; cases of fundamental importance to the people affected, including adoption, childcare and domestic violence; and cases with a wider public interest, such as challenges to the actions of public bodies. But in local areas partnerships are setting their own priorities. Some areas, as one former minister put it, are advice deserts, others advice mazes. Traditionally, while agencies referred cases to solicitors, few referred clients to other agencies. Whether someone with a problem found the right helper was largely a matter of chance. Last November Paths to Justice, the largest survey of the ways the public tries to solve legal problems, painted a picture of people floundering about trying to find help and often giving up in frustration. The Community Legal Service aims to change that picture. Partnerships now operate in 70 areas, covering one third of the population of England and Wales. By April 2002 the aim is to cover 90%. A key task of partnerships is to set up effective local referral networks so people with problems will end up in the right place, no matter at what point they enter the system. In Derby, Wendy Endsor went to her local law centre when she encountered difficulties at work. \"I worked as an after-sales manager for a company bringing in cars from the Continent. I went off sick to have an operation and was told I would have to work as a receptionist when I came back. The law centre said they couldn't do that - what they were proposing was constructive dismissal. I sent in my notice and said I was leaving due to my demotion.\" Carol Lambert, an advice worker at the law centre, represented her at the tribunal, supervised by Jon Jarvis, a law centre solicitor. Endsor won the case and was pleased to get \u00a32,500 compensation. \"I hadn't really thought about money. I just didn't want them to do to somebody else what they'd done to me.\" Using the Just Ask website's powerful search engine, anyone with a problem will be able to key in a simple cry for help - such as \"I am being evicted. Help me\" - and come up with an answer from among 400 other sites. There is also an electronic directory of 15,000 sources of help including solicitors, advice centres and specialist resources, which will produce a list of the nearest helpers speaking a particular language and knowledgeable about the particular area of law. From today, commuters and shoppers will be able to access the website at TownPages information booths in train stations and supermarkets around the country. Hazel Genn, professor of socio-legal studies at University College, London and author of the Paths to Justice survey, said: \"My book ended by saying there's a huge need for information and help. If the Community Legal Service is capable of delivering early advice so it can get in and knock problems on the head before they become huge, I think it's an incredibly good idea. We will have to watch and see how it's used.\"",

It is particularly concerned that it has lost many valuable senior managers between 50 and 60, and cannot easily replace them.</p> <p>Although the company said yesterday that \"it is not an issue at the moment\", sources within BT said last night that the company was increasingly having to draw upon outside consultants because the pool of senior management skills was diminishing. In some cases a retirement age of up to 74 was being considered.</p> <p>A source said: \"This is very much a live issue at BT. Senior staff retention is extremely important. Because of early retirement many of them sometimes leave for larger salaries outside, and we just cannot afford to lose them. We will have to take a decision.\"</p> <p>Sources said that the first person to be affected by the move could be BT's chief executive, Peter Bonfield, who is approaching 60. They said that BT's employment rules made no provision for him to stay on beyond 60.</p> <p>The crisis at BT comes as the government is about to launch its performance and innovation initiative designed to get people over the age of 50 back to work.</p> <p>The inactivity of older workers is estimated to cost the British economy \u00a326bn a year in lost production, one fifth of the gross domestic product over the next five years.</p> <p>Margaret Hodge, minister for employment and equal opportunities, said: \"The government believes that wasting talent by displaying age prejudice in the workplace is bad for the economy and unfair on the individual.</p> <p>\"But we cannot tackle age prejudice on our own. With the help of our partners in industry, we can make sure that more people wake up to the message that it is damaging society as a whole.\"</p> <p>The CBI said that \"a change of culture\" was under way on early retirement. It added that many of its members were struggling to find ways of retaining older staff, a situation which was being exacerbated by the buoyant labour market.</p> <p>Several other leading companies apart from BT are campaigning to give older people better opportunities in the work place. They include the BBC, Boots, Dixons, B&amp;Q and Sainsbury's.</p> <p>Helen Garner, campaigns director of the Employers' Forum on Age, an employer-led organisation to promote a mixed-age workforce, said: \"We have come to view our ageing work force as a burden, not an asset. But this ignorance and prejudice is costing us dear.\"</p> <p>Ms Garner said that most employers did not seem able to grasp that a \"demographic time bomb has exploded in the UK\" and that there had been a significant shift in the working population. She said that 28% of men over 50 were inactive compared with 7% in 1975.</p> <p>Within five years, 36% of the labour force would be over 45, and by 2010 the figure would have grown to 40%, yet only 17% of those at work in five years will be aged between 16-24.</p> <p>Research by Reed Skills Index shows that 56% of companies are experiencing skills shortage in recruitment. The company said that it made \"strong commercial sense to increase the size of the pond and bring in many people who are excluded from the workplace simply because of age\".</p> <p>Sainsbury's said that it was actively pursuing a policy of recruiting older people. Although their productivity was lower than younger people's, they were extremely reliable and flexible.</p> <p>The company said it employed 1,486 people over the age of 65, of whom 10 were over 80. One of its 80-year-olds is a former managing director, and a 72-year-old worker is a former City banker.</p>",

      "bodyText": "British Telecom is poised to be the first company to raise the retirement age beyond 70 because of a growing shortage of management skills at senior level, highlighting a growing issue throughout British industry. The company, where the official retiring age is 60, has been examining the problem for the past year. It is particularly concerned that it has lost many valuable senior managers between 50 and 60, and cannot easily replace them. Although the company said yesterday that \"it is not an issue at the moment\", sources within BT said last night that the company was increasingly having to draw upon outside consultants because the pool of senior management skills was diminishing. In some cases a retirement age of up to 74 was being considered. A source said: \"This is very much a live issue at BT. Senior staff retention is extremely important. Because of early retirement many of them sometimes leave for larger salaries outside, and we just cannot afford to lose them. We will have to take a decision.\" Sources said that the first person to be affected by the move could be BT's chief executive, Peter Bonfield, who is approaching 60. They said that BT's employment rules made no provision for him to stay on beyond 60. The crisis at BT comes as the government is about to launch its performance and innovation initiative designed to get people over the age of 50 back to work. The inactivity of older workers is estimated to cost the British economy \u00a326bn a year in lost production, one fifth of the gross domestic product over the next five years. Margaret Hodge, minister for employment and equal opportunities, said: \"The government believes that wasting talent by displaying age prejudice in the workplace is bad for the economy and unfair on the individual. \"But we cannot tackle age prejudice on our own. With the help of our partners in industry, we can make sure that more people wake up to the message that it is damaging society as a whole.\" The CBI said that \"a change of culture\" was under way on early retirement. It added that many of its members were struggling to find ways of retaining older staff, a situation which was being exacerbated by the buoyant labour market. Several other leading companies apart from BT are campaigning to give older people better opportunities in the work place. They include the BBC, Boots, Dixons, B&amp;Q and Sainsbury's. Helen Garner, campaigns director of the Employers' Forum on Age, an employer-led organisation to promote a mixed-age workforce, said: \"We have come to view our ageing work force as a burden, not an asset. But this ignorance and prejudice is costing us dear.\" Ms Garner said that most employers did not seem able to grasp that a \"demographic time bomb has exploded in the UK\" and that there had been a significant shift in the working population. She said that 28% of men over 50 were inactive compared with 7% in 1975. Within five years, 36% of the labour force would be over 45, and by 2010 the figure would have grown to 40%, yet only 17% of those at work in five years will be aged between 16-24. Research by Reed Skills Index shows that 56% of companies are experiencing skills shortage in recruitment. The company said that it made \"strong commercial sense to increase the size of the pond and bring in many people who are excluded from the workplace simply because of age\". Sainsbury's said that it was actively pursuing a policy of recruiting older people. Although their productivity was lower than younger people's, they were extremely reliable and flexible. The company said it employed 1,486 people over the age of 65, of whom 10 were over 80. One of its 80-year-olds is a former managing director, and a 72-year-old worker is a former City banker.",

In the survey of 1,019 adults, 38% thought \"gullible\" was the characteristic most likely to be associated with men in adverts, with only 12% thinking men came across as caring and 14% as intelligent. By contrast, more than 25% said women had a caring, assertive or intelligent image. The image of men as beer drinking football fans and of women as clothes and make-up shopaholics was seen by 39% and 48% of viewers respectively as a frequently used but inaccurate stereotype. The group was asked about the advert for the Fiat Punto in which a man explains that the car features capacity for 94 shopping bags, 24 pockets for make-up and a girlie button for power steering. A woman explains it features a navigational system, \"because if you can't find your way around a woman's body you won't be able to find your way around Birmingham\". Of those that had seen the commercial, 26% found it patronising to women and 17% patronising to men. Despite this, more than half the men and 39% of the women found it amusing.",

It said some of the rise was due to council cemeteries charging more for a plot, but also cautioned the charges were estimates and the final bill might be more. Cremation now costs an average \u00a31,215 - 12% up in two years. 'Too few' women councillors Women hold only 27% of seats in local government, according to a report by Labour MP Harriet Harman. One council of 442 in England, Scotland and Wales had a majority of women members - Aylesbury Vale in Buckinghamshire, with 57% female councillors. Scotland had the lowest pro portion, 21.8%, and the South-west the highest, 29.2%. Schoolboy dies in quarry fall A body brought up by a rescue team from a ledge 100ft down a quarry at Penmaen Head in North Wales, was identified yesterday as Mark Jones, 14, who lived less than a mile away. His mother had thought he had been staying with a friend on Friday night after a birthday party. Doctorate for David Hockney David Hockney, 63 and born in Bradford, is to receive an honorary doctorate of letters from the University of Leeds at a ceremony on June 8, when Lord Melvyn Bragg, TV presenter and author, will be inducted as the university's chancellor.

It's a soccer convention that if you put in three on the pitch, you get to keep the ball.

Of her current squeeze, she confided: \"I'm pretty sure I'm going to sell a story on him soon.\" The director asked why. \"Because the relationship isn't going anywhere.\" Yorkshire Emma's calls to the press were simply business. Surrey Emma's were unfinished business. </p> <p>But - although it has two characters with the same name - it's still hard to be certain that this film is fact rather than fiction.

You sometimes wonder if the Emmas are simply Match Of the Day viewers with lively imaginations. </p> <p>You would be more willing to bet your replica shirt on the evidence of Lisa - a Tyneside pizza waitress who was once alternately dating Paul Gascoigne and Ruud Gullitt - and sold her story to the Star after details had been revealed. The best moment is her revelation that the Star reporter had assumed the silky Dutch play-maker would be better in bed than the porky Geordie.

A Euro-sceptic newspaper politically, the Star is apparently in awe of the continent erotically. </p> <p>Dave - the Star reporter who handled Lisa's case - is a shave-head in a pinstripe.

      "body": "<p>Long before I was through describing the kind of woman I was looking for, Jan Nichols began to laugh and shake her head in an appreciative manner, as if she found my quest entertaining, albeit slightly pathetic.</p> <p>\"I don't think you'll find anyone like that in here,\" she shouted above the music. We were in the Hard Rock Cafe, the gigantic Orlando branch where Jan is a manager. She was from Hull and would try to help me, although she didn't think I stood much of a chance. This was proving much, much harder than I had expected.</p> <p>All I wanted was a woman over the age of 33 with an income over \u00a320,000, probably married with kids that she would pile into the back of the estate car sitting in the drive. Or perhaps it was a 4x4 or a minivan.</p> <p>I had been told she would bring the whole family here, to the Sunshine State, to escape temporarily from the pressures in Britain - the second-rate education system, the worsening hospitals and the smug government with its preachy, holier-than-thou Prime Minister.</p> <p>Her name would be Anthea or Glenys, or perhaps Geeta if she had Asian antecedents. But when I met her I would know her simply as Florida Woman. Where was she?</p> <p>The Conservative party has supposedly discovered that there are tens of thousands like her - enough to win the next election, even. They have identified her as their paradigm target voter, the Conservative answer to Tony Blair's Mondeo Man of 1997. In fact, it seems quite likely that Florida Woman has married Mondeo Man, and is now poised to turn him away from the stealth-socialism of New Labour in the name of William Hague.</p> <p>I had spent the better part of a uncomfortably hot, humid Orlando Saturday approaching strangers in car-parks, shopping-malls and theme-parks, and I had yet to find a single Florida Woman.</p> <p>We - the photographer Vasha Hunt and I - had started out at the Delta Orlando Resort, where my research had predicted Florida Woman would be plentiful. And indeed, when I ran through the Identikit checklist (age, income, likely attitude and attributes), a helpful American woman listened carefully and nodded. She was sure there were plenty like that in the hotel, but right now they would be out enjoying what the state had to offer.</p> <p>Florida is the world's biggest playground. The attractions fan out in all directions from the state's heart at Orlando - Disney World, Universal Studios, car racing, aquaria, alligator swamps. By the time you reach the Kennedy Space Centre in the east, it seems like another theme park, with solid fuel booster rockets in place of giant mice named Mickey.</p> <p>Maybe this is what gives Florida Woman her special identity. She is drawn to Florida because it is a monument to capitalism. Only an unbridled economy could be productive enough to turn an area the size of England into a funfair, with enough parking for the rest of the world. An Eden of leisure where everything works and service comes with a smile.</p> <p>From the Delta Orlando Resort, we drove a short distance to Universal Studios, a pastiche city built in homage to cinema, ringed by reputedly the biggest multi-storey car-park in the world. We left the car in the King Kong section and - at Vasha's prompting - wound up in the Hard Rock Cafe with the helpful and friendly Jan.</p> <p>\"You won't find Florida Woman here,\" she said, chuckling.</p> <p>The customers we talked to more or less proved her point. Katie Murray had come on holiday with her parents, Barbara and John Stormont, her husband Lionel, and Joseph, her two-year-old. They were all originally from the London area, although the Stormonts had moved out to Dorset. John was a sales director and Lionel was a publican. Katie and Barbara were both housewives.</p> <p>Like Florida Woman, Katie and Barbara both voted Labour in 1997 but now agreed that the Blair honeymoon was over. Just as we began to hope we had found what we were looking for, they both insisted that their state of mild disappointment did not leave them pining for William Hague.</p> <p>\"He's a real non-starter, a real non-entity,\" Katie said. \"Even with Portillo, though he's a right-winger, they'd do better. At least he's got a bit of character.\"</p> <p>Barbara agreed with her daughter's withering assessment. \"Even getting married hasn't improved him,\" she said.</p> <p>Anyway, mother and daughter agreed, things were not nearly bad enough to make them wander from the Labour fold. There were problems in the state schools, but the comprehensive Katie had been to had after all provided a good education. And yes, the National Health Service was creaking, but Labour had just earmarked a whole pile of new money for the hospitals.</p> <p>Seeing our disappointment, Jan intervened to say lunch was on the house and tried to cheer us up by announcing that she had strong Tory leanings. Her father had been a policeman and successive Conservative governments had looked after him well. She had had her baby at Orlando's Arnold Palmer Hospital, and thought it was a thousand times better than the NHS. She did not think private health insurance was that expensive and most Americans who did not have it had probably opted not to spend money on it.</p> <p>Unfortunately for Hague, however, this instinctive Tory had no plans of going back to Britain to vote, not in the next election, probably not ever. Jan had gone beyond the bounds of Florida Woman's template and had decided to stay.</p> <p>If we wanted Florida Women, she suggested, we should try Orlando's famous shopping malls, where British tourists congregated in the afternoon after a day's baking in the sun. \"You'll see them all in their black shorts and socks,\" Jan predicted.</p> <p>There were no Brits in black shorts and socks at the mall, but the British were still clearly identifiable at a hundred paces. It was partly the sunburn, though there were sunburnt Americans too, and partly the unassuming way that the Britons walked and shopped - as if they expected their consumer rights to be stripped from them at any moment.</p> <p>Margaret Tvedt and Irene Watson were having a great day's consumerism at the almost endless open air mall at the end of Orlando's International Drive. Prices for most well-known clothes brands were less than half what they would be back home, and Margaret was taking the opportunity to buy some new kit for her son, Chris, who was working as a waiter at the British pavilion in Disney World. At work he said he wore our traditional national costume: a yellow shirt, blue plus-fours, white knee-socks and black shoes.</p> <p>Neither Margaret nor Irene seemed promising material for Hague. They were both Scots, for one thing. Margaret, a 46-year-old who drives a BMW cabriolet at home, had voted Conservative in 1997 and probably would again, so did not represent a net Tory gain. Irene, meanwhile, was wavering, but in the opposite direction from Florida Woman. She had voted Conservative last time, but had been encouraged by all the money New Labour said it was going to put in the NHS, and would wait and see if it went towards financing \"more bodies in beds\" rather than just bureaucracy.</p> <p>When asked what they thought about William Hague, both women said \"Not a lot\" at the same time.</p> <p>\"He doesn't have much charisma or stature and that puts a lot of people off,\" Margaret said. \"He's not attractive to look at, and that seems to count for a lot these days, unfortunately.\"</p> <p>In the end, the nearest candidate to Florida Woman we found in Orlando was called Jill. Jill Robinson was from Cobham in Surrey and she was crazy about Florida. This was her third time in Orlando with her husband, Martin, and their sons, Tom and Harry.</p> <p>They had moved away from the London borough of Wandsworth partly to escape the benighted state schools there, they said. Martin, an architect, thought Blair was doing a creditable job but Jill held a different, much tougher view (an encouraging, Florida Woman-like trait).</p> <p>\"The health service is in a terrible mess,\" she said. \"And I think he's slowly putting up the cost of living. It's such a gradual process that we're being hoodwinked.\"</p> <p>Moreover, Jill had good things to say about the young Conservative leader. \"He's a very good debater. There are no two ways about that. And he does seem to be listening to what people in the party are saying,\" she said. \"They are still sorting themselves out as a party, but I feel at the moment the Conservatives are in a better position to improve things.\"</p> <p>Unfortunately, Jill Robinson was not an exact fit for Florida Woman's glass slipper. She drove an old Toyota Celica, not a Jeep or an estate. And she was not a repentant Blairite. She was an instinctive Tory who had simply not voted in 1997. Still, I was in no mood to be fussy. After all, she represented a net electoral gain for Hague. Martin agreed that his wife was about as close as we would find.</p> <p>But the fact remains that, after scouring the state's tourist hub for a whole day, we had found only one Florida Woman. It seemed unlikely that she was a new, unstoppable force in British politics. It was more like tracking down a rare and fragile species in the wild.</p> <p>Perhaps that is the way things are with these political safaris. Maybe Tony Blair's Mondeo Man and Worcester Woman seemed equally exotic in their day, only to breed into trampling herds of Labour voters when the election came around. Could Florida Woman be doing the same thing, gathering strength at the home of Mickey Mouse until she is strong enough to crush New Labour with a single blow?

      "body": "<p>\"Full fathom five Thy father lies.\" </p> <p>A lovely landscape with a liberal topping of twaddle goes down nicely on a Sunday. There are quiet days when you would rather not have your emotions stirred up as with a mighty spoon. That's why the Wednesday play was on a Wednesday. <strong> Deceit</strong> (BBC 1), a two-part psychological thriller, has oxygenating Suffolk seascapes. All that dazzle on the water, all that superfluous sky make you feel you've had the day at the seaside you were vaguely considering. </p> <p>Clare Francis's area of expertise is ships, as Dick Francis's is horses, so there is a good, strong skeleton to the story, based on her novel. </p> <p>Which is that Harry Richmond and his yacht have vanished without trace leaving Ellen, a beautiful, consolate widow (Francesca Annis), a couple of children and a fine tangle of debts and skullduggery. </p> <p>Red herrings are laid out neatly nose to tail. Harry has been having an affair with a blonde. He seems to have embezzled a quarter of a million from an orphans' charity. His own money has softly and secretly vanished away. </p> <p>Det Inspector Thing assumes - as one would - that Harry is even now in Acapulco with the blonde. </p> <p>Several men are sniffing around Ellen and there is someone with respiratory problems lurking unseen in the shrubbery. (This somehow reminds me of Frank Benson, a famous Hamlet in his day, who, when his memory failed, would say \"Crouch we awhile and mark!\" to the horror of his Horatio.) </p> <p>The nautically named Jack (Peter O'Brien) , handsomest and most assiduous of the sniffers, discovers that Ellen herself was seen taking Harry's yacht to sea on the day he disappeared. </p> <p>She tells him that Harry committed suicide and she took the boat to sea and scuttled it (\"Sever all the waste pipes! Open the sea cocks! Close the hatches!\") to hide the body. I greatly admired the way Francesca Annis leaped from boat to boat, apparently doing her own stunts. It was a gripping sequence because it was based on solid, nautical sense but otherwise it made no sort of sense at all. </p> <p>I am pretty sure I can guess the real reason for Harry's death and disappearance without reading the book. It is just amazing how many bestsellers I haven't read. </p> <p> <strong> Bob Martin</strong> (ITV) is an all-too plausible comedy about the host of a tired game-show. Michael Barrymore as Bob seemed unusually subdued but Terry Wogan as, well, Wogan, made a meal of a media monster, shrouded in shadow and cigar smoke. It was as though Barrymore was determined not to be mistaken for himself. And so was Wogan. </p> <p>The plot was that Bob Martin wanted to present the Eurovision Song Contest. In <strong> Top Ten: Eurovision </strong> (Channel 4), Wogan gave a battle-scared commentary from the front. (Should that be battle-scarred? Not necessarily). Luxembourg was a particularly fraught assignment. Wogan said: \"You couldn't get anywhere near the hall for motorised vehicles and special forces and uzis and machine guns, machine gun nests, tracker dogs, razor wire. You had to beat your way in and, on the night, I'll never forget the floor manager saying to the audience: \"Please do not stand up to applaud or you may be shot by the security forces.\" Shooting the audience is a novel twist. In Israel, when Dana International fell off her high heels, security thought she had been shot and flung themselves on her in heaps to take the second bullet.

      "bodyText": "\"Full fathom five Thy father lies.\" A lovely landscape with a liberal topping of twaddle goes down nicely on a Sunday. There are quiet days when you would rather not have your emotions stirred up as with a mighty spoon. That's why the Wednesday play was on a Wednesday. Deceit (BBC 1), a two-part psychological thriller, has oxygenating Suffolk seascapes. All that dazzle on the water, all that superfluous sky make you feel you've had the day at the seaside you were vaguely considering. Clare Francis's area of expertise is ships, as Dick Francis's is horses, so there is a good, strong skeleton to the story, based on her novel. Which is that Harry Richmond and his yacht have vanished without trace leaving Ellen, a beautiful, consolate widow (Francesca Annis), a couple of children and a fine tangle of debts and skullduggery. Red herrings are laid out neatly nose to tail. Harry has been having an affair with a blonde. He seems to have embezzled a quarter of a million from an orphans' charity. His own money has softly and secretly vanished away. Det Inspector Thing assumes - as one would - that Harry is even now in Acapulco with the blonde. Several men are sniffing around Ellen and there is someone with respiratory problems lurking unseen in the shrubbery. (This somehow reminds me of Frank Benson, a famous Hamlet in his day, who, when his memory failed, would say \"Crouch we awhile and mark!\" to the horror of his Horatio.) The nautically named Jack (Peter O'Brien) , handsomest and most assiduous of the sniffers, discovers that Ellen herself was seen taking Harry's yacht to sea on the day he disappeared. She tells him that Harry committed suicide and she took the boat to sea and scuttled it (\"Sever all the waste pipes! Open the sea cocks! Close the hatches!\") to hide the body. I greatly admired the way Francesca Annis leaped from boat to boat, apparently doing her own stunts. It was a gripping sequence because it was based on solid, nautical sense but otherwise it made no sort of sense at all. I am pretty sure I can guess the real reason for Harry's death and disappearance without reading the book. It is just amazing how many bestsellers I haven't read. Bob Martin (ITV) is an all-too plausible comedy about the host of a tired game-show. Michael Barrymore as Bob seemed unusually subdued but Terry Wogan as, well, Wogan, made a meal of a media monster, shrouded in shadow and cigar smoke. It was as though Barrymore was determined not to be mistaken for himself. And so was Wogan. The plot was that Bob Martin wanted to present the Eurovision Song Contest. In Top Ten: Eurovision (Channel 4), Wogan gave a battle-scared commentary from the front. (Should that be battle-scarred? Not necessarily). Luxembourg was a particularly fraught assignment. Wogan said: \"You couldn't get anywhere near the hall for motorised vehicles and special forces and uzis and machine guns, machine gun nests, tracker dogs, razor wire. You had to beat your way in and, on the night, I'll never forget the floor manager saying to the audience: \"Please do not stand up to applaud or you may be shot by the security forces.\" Shooting the audience is a novel twist. In Israel, when Dana International fell off her high heels, security thought she had been shot and flung themselves on her in heaps to take the second bullet. Or that's what they said afterwards. The Last Of The Summer Wine (BBC 1) is a series about second childhood, a second chance to be carefree and a nuisance to your neighbours. In age Foggy, always Foggy to me, Clegg and Compo reverted to the boys they had once been, though, strictly speaking, Compo had never verted in the first place.

MPs are expected to give the bill a rough ride when it reaches report stage in the Commons this week, and some Labour peers are forecasting more serious clashes in the Lords.</p> <p>Those supporting further change believe Tony Blair is failing to deliver a manifesto promise to lift the veil of secrecy from central government and public bodies, leaving too many decisions on disclosure in the hands of ministers.</p> <p>Mark Fisher, former arts minister and Labour MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central, told BBC1's On The Record that between 40 and 60 backbench Labour MPs were unhappy about the issue.</p> <p>The dissenters could include those chairing select committees. Critics of the bill claim it has too many loopholes, giving public bodies opportunities for keeping information secret. Concessions announced by Jack Straw, the home secretary, have failed to appease critics - while he has moved to amend the bill to allow the information commissioner to order disclosure in the public interest, this move could still be vetoed.</p> <p>Speaking of the BSE cattle crisis and how it only became public knowledge in the 1990s, Tony Wright, chairman of the public administration select committee, said on the BBC programme: \"The public want to know how they could have been duped for so long.\"</p> <p>Lord Peter Archer, Labour chairman of the Lords select committee on the bill, warned: \"If there is no concession at all I'm pretty sure there will be a pitched battle in the Lords.\"</p> <p>And Lord Richards, former Labour leader in the Lords, predicted the bill would \"ping pong\" around parliament, forcing the government to make concessions.</p> <p>Mike O'Brien, Home Office minister, said the bill was about balancing \"a right to ensure we have a government which is efficient, against a right to ensure that in a democracy the people know what the government is doing\".</p>",

      "bodyText": "The government is this week facing a Commons rebellion of up to 60 Labour MPs demanding further strengthening of freedom of information law. Senior party figures who maintain the freedom of information bill is too weak despite the government's concessions, will today meet the home secretary to press for an extension of the right to know amid claims that ministers are \"on the ropes\" over the issue. MPs are expected to give the bill a rough ride when it reaches report stage in the Commons this week, and some Labour peers are forecasting more serious clashes in the Lords. Those supporting further change believe Tony Blair is failing to deliver a manifesto promise to lift the veil of secrecy from central government and public bodies, leaving too many decisions on disclosure in the hands of ministers. Mark Fisher, former arts minister and Labour MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central, told BBC1's On The Record that between 40 and 60 backbench Labour MPs were unhappy about the issue. The dissenters could include those chairing select committees. Critics of the bill claim it has too many loopholes, giving public bodies opportunities for keeping information secret. Concessions announced by Jack Straw, the home secretary, have failed to appease critics - while he has moved to amend the bill to allow the information commissioner to order disclosure in the public interest, this move could still be vetoed. Speaking of the BSE cattle crisis and how it only became public knowledge in the 1990s, Tony Wright, chairman of the public administration select committee, said on the BBC programme: \"The public want to know how they could have been duped for so long.\" Lord Peter Archer, Labour chairman of the Lords select committee on the bill, warned: \"If there is no concession at all I'm pretty sure there will be a pitched battle in the Lords.\" And Lord Richards, former Labour leader in the Lords, predicted the bill would \"ping pong\" around parliament, forcing the government to make concessions. Mike O'Brien, Home Office minister, said the bill was about balancing \"a right to ensure we have a government which is efficient, against a right to ensure that in a democracy the people know what the government is doing\".",

Mr Baron Cohen is now leading one of the main cultural projects of the Landless Movement (MST), a radical organisation representing several million poor Brazilians that fights for social justice in a country with huge extremes in the distribution of wealth.</p> <p>Mr Baron Cohen's official role is to coordinate the building of six monuments to act as a counterpoint to the official celebrations of Brazil's 500th birthday this year. Under the banner \"The Other 500 years\", the monuments are meant to show the resistance history of the Indian, black and poor communities since the arrival of the former Portuguese colonialists In South America.</p> <p>But while the sculptures will be Mr Baron Cohen's most visible contribution to the organisation, his involvement also represents an MST attempt to change its culture.

      "bodyText": "When Dan Baron Cohen arrived in Brazil two years ago, he read a magazine article about the country's mass movement of dispossessed rural workers. \"It was my first knowledge about them,\" he says. \"And I immediately wanted to know more.\" Little did the Welsh drama lecturer realise that soon afterwards he would be swept up by the landless cause. Mr Baron Cohen is now leading one of the main cultural projects of the Landless Movement (MST), a radical organisation representing several million poor Brazilians that fights for social justice in a country with huge extremes in the distribution of wealth. Mr Baron Cohen's official role is to coordinate the building of six monuments to act as a counterpoint to the official celebrations of Brazil's 500th birthday this year. Under the banner \"The Other 500 years\", the monuments are meant to show the resistance history of the Indian, black and poor communities since the arrival of the former Portuguese colonialists In South America. But while the sculptures will be Mr Baron Cohen's most visible contribution to the organisation, his involvement also represents an MST attempt to change its culture. It wants a more human face than the one conveyed by the hatchet-waving Marxists who have run some of its takeovers of little-used land. Since it emerged 16 years ago the MST has revolutionised land reform in Brazil by organising mass squats on unproductive farms and refusing to leave until the government awarded the squatters title.

It will need approval from at least 14 clubs beforeit can be made available. </p> <p>The total package is expected to generate a windfall of \u00a32bn for the clubs. </p> <p>The rights are expected to be divided up into more packages than in 1996 when live rights were awarded to BSkyB and highlights to the BBC, reflecting the advent of new technologies and a growing number of interested broadcasters. </p> <p>One main block of live rights is expected to be auctioned and smaller secondary packages could also be on offer. One broadcaster could have rights over Sunday afternoon matches for instance while another may have access to midweek games. </p> <p>Clubs are also expected to be allowed to broadcast matches on their own TV channels and the internet. A growing band of clubs are setting up their own channels alongside media partners. BSkyB owns stakes in five clubs, NTL in three and Granada in one. </p> <p>It is widely believed that snatching the Premier League from terrestial TV in 1992 was the key turning point for BSkyB and sport remains the key driver for subscriptions in pay-TV. </p> <p>At the last round there were eight main cable companies. Now there are just two, with the largest, NTL, supercharged by shareholders that include France Telecom and Microsoft. </p> <p>ITV is also now in a stronger position through Granada and Carlton's joint ownership of OnDigital, providing the network with a pay-TV platform. ITV is reported to have offered \u00a3100m for a highlights package which could spell the end of the BBC's Match of the Day. Channel 5 may also make a bid for highlights.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The auction of the next set of broadcasting rights for football's Premier League begins today in a contest which could have profound implications for the TV groups vying for a slice of the action. Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore will meet the 20 club chairman this morning to outline the tender document which will be sent to broadcasters. It will need approval from at least 14 clubs beforeit can be made available. The total package is expected to generate a windfall of \u00a32bn for the clubs. The rights are expected to be divided up into more packages than in 1996 when live rights were awarded to BSkyB and highlights to the BBC, reflecting the advent of new technologies and a growing number of interested broadcasters. One main block of live rights is expected to be auctioned and smaller secondary packages could also be on offer. One broadcaster could have rights over Sunday afternoon matches for instance while another may have access to midweek games. Clubs are also expected to be allowed to broadcast matches on their own TV channels and the internet. A growing band of clubs are setting up their own channels alongside media partners. BSkyB owns stakes in five clubs, NTL in three and Granada in one. It is widely believed that snatching the Premier League from terrestial TV in 1992 was the key turning point for BSkyB and sport remains the key driver for subscriptions in pay-TV. At the last round there were eight main cable companies. Now there are just two, with the largest, NTL, supercharged by shareholders that include France Telecom and Microsoft. ITV is also now in a stronger position through Granada and Carlton's joint ownership of OnDigital, providing the network with a pay-TV platform. ITV is reported to have offered \u00a3100m for a highlights package which could spell the end of the BBC's Match of the Day. Channel 5 may also make a bid for highlights.",

      "byline": "Michael Ellison",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Steven Wright knocked 'em dead in the Long Island town of Patchogue. I'd like to tell you exactly how he did it, but this must remain a secret between him and those who saw the act. The comedian and his representatives insist that none of the jokes he told at the theatre or in conversation later should be allowed to slip out and alert his London audience. </p> <p>Wright is hardly short of material, even for a show lasting over 90 minutes, during which he is assisted only by a chair, two stools and a guitar. His talent for surreal one-liners, delivered in a deep, dry monotone, has already won him a headline show at New York's Carnegie Hall; other credits include a Grammy Award-nominated album, and several movie and TV appearances. The Appointments of Dennis Jennings, the short film which he co-wrote and starred in, has also won him an Oscar. </p> <p>\"The new show's not a test,\" he says later in a Manhattan hotel lobby. \"I came up with a bunch of new material and that length of time just seemed right for now. I don't see people getting up and leaving.\" </p> <p>Wright's delivery is routinely described as deadpan; the same term might apply to his career. Yes, he is a star, but his is a jeans and motorbike boots stardom rather than a Las Vegas celebrity. He has so far escaped Robin Williams syndrome, the affliction that obliges comedians to transform themselves into lachrymose sentimentalists who are kind to children though not to patrons of cinemas. </p> <p>Forty-four-year-old Wright started out telling jokes in a Chinese restaurant in Boston and got his big break on the Johnny Carson Show in 1982. Carson couldn't get enough of him: the show practically adopted Wright, inviting him back time and again. </p> <p>Three years later he made his screen debut in Desperately Seeking Susan; 12 months after that he collaborated with Roberto Benigni and Jim Jarmusch on the short film Coffee and Cigarettes. He has acted in Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers and Mike Myers's pre-Austin Powers comedy So I Married an Axe Murderer, and his laconic voice has been heard everywhere from the Simpsons to Reservoir Dogs. </p> <p>Although he says that none of his jokes is ever retired, Wright seems reluctant to risk repeating himself, or to do anything so gross as capitalise on success. The Appointments of Dennis Jennings was made in 1988, but his second short, One Soldier, which he also directed, was only made last year. I Have a Pony, his comedy album, was up for a Grammy 14 years ago and he has yet to make another. \"I think I should make one every century,\" he says. </p> <p>Does he think he should be more famous? \"I'm just happy that I draw in an audience. Having come up in the 80s, I feel very fortunate to still be making a living from my imagination.\" </p> <p>He isn't thrilled to be described as a comic genius. \"I just see myself as a guy who makes things up. I never tire of going on stage,\" he says, picking carefully at his beard. \"TV and movies are exciting when they're finished but they're boring compared with being in front of an audience.\" </p> <p>Wright sees no great need to make compromises for tonight's audience in London. As always, he will draw on the foibles of common experience rather than American politics or current affairs. He does not even want to ridicule the presidential candidates. \"I don't like politics.

      "bodyText": "Steven Wright knocked 'em dead in the Long Island town of Patchogue. I'd like to tell you exactly how he did it, but this must remain a secret between him and those who saw the act. The comedian and his representatives insist that none of the jokes he told at the theatre or in conversation later should be allowed to slip out and alert his London audience. Wright is hardly short of material, even for a show lasting over 90 minutes, during which he is assisted only by a chair, two stools and a guitar. His talent for surreal one-liners, delivered in a deep, dry monotone, has already won him a headline show at New York's Carnegie Hall; other credits include a Grammy Award-nominated album, and several movie and TV appearances. The Appointments of Dennis Jennings, the short film which he co-wrote and starred in, has also won him an Oscar. \"The new show's not a test,\" he says later in a Manhattan hotel lobby. \"I came up with a bunch of new material and that length of time just seemed right for now. I don't see people getting up and leaving.\" Wright's delivery is routinely described as deadpan; the same term might apply to his career. Yes, he is a star, but his is a jeans and motorbike boots stardom rather than a Las Vegas celebrity. He has so far escaped Robin Williams syndrome, the affliction that obliges comedians to transform themselves into lachrymose sentimentalists who are kind to children though not to patrons of cinemas. Forty-four-year-old Wright started out telling jokes in a Chinese restaurant in Boston and got his big break on the Johnny Carson Show in 1982. Carson couldn't get enough of him: the show practically adopted Wright, inviting him back time and again. Three years later he made his screen debut in Desperately Seeking Susan; 12 months after that he collaborated with Roberto Benigni and Jim Jarmusch on the short film Coffee and Cigarettes. He has acted in Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers and Mike Myers's pre-Austin Powers comedy So I Married an Axe Murderer, and his laconic voice has been heard everywhere from the Simpsons to Reservoir Dogs. Although he says that none of his jokes is ever retired, Wright seems reluctant to risk repeating himself, or to do anything so gross as capitalise on success. The Appointments of Dennis Jennings was made in 1988, but his second short, One Soldier, which he also directed, was only made last year. I Have a Pony, his comedy album, was up for a Grammy 14 years ago and he has yet to make another. \"I think I should make one every century,\" he says. Does he think he should be more famous? \"I'm just happy that I draw in an audience. Having come up in the 80s, I feel very fortunate to still be making a living from my imagination.\" He isn't thrilled to be described as a comic genius. \"I just see myself as a guy who makes things up. I never tire of going on stage,\" he says, picking carefully at his beard. \"TV and movies are exciting when they're finished but they're boring compared with being in front of an audience.\" Wright sees no great need to make compromises for tonight's audience in London. As always, he will draw on the foibles of common experience rather than American politics or current affairs. He does not even want to ridicule the presidential candidates. \"I don't like politics. Growing up during the Nixon era, I don't believe in politics. I barely believe in civilisation. What I deal with is the stuff in the middle, the stuff that's between dust and the Big Bang.\" That being the case, the maxim that humour loses nearly everything in translation somewhere in the middle of the Atlantic should not apply here. \"There's only a few jokes that don't work,\" he claims. \"I'm very fortunate in that sense because I talk about such basic things. It's not really cultural. I don't change my act: I change my outlook on life. I try to act as if I'm left-handed while I'm in London. In England they're more abstract and bizarre. It's more conservative in the US, more logical: this is this is this. In Britain I can be more abstract. I think I kind of fit in both categories.\" When the word abstract is raised in this context, a paean to Monty Python cannot be far behind. \"I loved it right from the beginning. Total insanity. I was hooked. Even now it would be very abstract compared with what's being done on TV.\" Wright also talks about Dickens and the Beatles. He does not mention Jim Davidson. He's looking forward to the London show. \"It's very special to go over there. It's a rush to perform in another country.

      "body": "<p>John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, and Nick Raynsford, minister for construction and planning, were down on the windswept north Greenwich peninsula in south-east London last week, opening a pair of show flats in what is known as the Millennium Village. I was up in Fairford Leys, a new small town on the fringe of Aylesbury, recording a radio programme about Prescott-era housing. Both the Millennium Village and Fairford Leys are responses to the apparent need in southern England for 3.8m houses over the next few years. Neither is a cynical response, yet both show that we appear to have absolutely no idea of how to build convincing modern housing. </p> <p>The Civic Trust, meanwhile, has given its award for the \"outstanding building of the last 40 years\" to Churchill Gardens in Pimlico, central London, a council estate designed and built between 1946 and 1961 along uncompromisingly Modern lines. Churchill Gardens houses 5,000 people in 1,800 flats and is, for the most part, popular among residents. It is a handsome group of buildings owned by Westminster council (half the flats are now leased from it) and designed by the then very young Philip Powell and Hidalgo Moya. </p> <p>Churchill Gardens is a mix of eight- and 10-floor blocks interspersed with three-storey houses and well-planned gardens. It enjoys a happy location on the Thames and, unlike north Greenwich, is not swept by Arctic winds. Arranged in rows or streets, Churchill Gardens owes as much to the notion of the Georgian terraced housing as it does to the utopian Modern movement housing schemes - cities of sun, light, green and air raised high into the sky over great city parks - pioneered by Le Corbusier from the early 20s. Here is one way of building decent homes on a dense scale in city centres for people on average to low incomes without sacrificing light, air and dignity. Sadly, such homes, or their contemporary equivalents, are unlikely to be built today. Land in Pimlico with river views would now be given over to luxury housing for the wealthy. It would be privately developed. It would be hierarchical, with lavish penthouses set over tiers of \"apartments\" and \"studios\". The poor would be excluded. </p> <p>The Millennium Village is an honest attempt, announced with a flourish by John Prescott in 1997, to create a new riverside community for people from a widish range of incomes. Here was the way we were going to live in the future: there would be homes that could expand as family needs grew; every home would have a computer; this would be a green world in which use of cars would be limited. </p> <p>The reality will be far more ordinary. The show flats are nicely appointed and well-made, a cut above what we have come to expect from most developers' housing in cities. But the whole development will look much like Docklands domestic architecture to date. It is bricky, slopey and would look more at home in Milton Keynes or on the edge of Stockholm than London (the leading architect, Ralph Erskine, is Swedish; he is also the designer of the Byker Wall housing scheme, Newcastle-upon-Tyne). There is nothing fundamentally urban about this project, even though it offers greater density - more people to the acre - than most recent suburban-style inner-city housing projects. On the other hand, it is called a \"village\" when it patently isn't. </p> <p>In that one quaint word, however, lies the heart of so much of our problem with contemporary housing. It's the word that leads us back to Fairford Leys. People who live in affluent, tree-lined districts of London insist on calling them \"villages\". Picking up on this nostalgic snobbery, those who build new homes (developers) and those who flog them (estate agents) like to label virtually all new housing developments \"villages\". Which none of them are. How strange that even in the middle of one of the greatest, most teeming, most cosmopolitan cities on earth so many people need to pretend they are living in villages, like Marie-Antoinettes playing milkmaids, far from the madding crowd. </p> <p>It is what many people want to believe, whether they are living on the north Greenwich peninsula or on the edge of a Buckinghamshire market town given a brutal Modern and postmodern makeover between 1960 and the present day. If the Millennium Village offers one view of how some of the 3.8m new homes planned for south-east England might look, Fairford Leys offers another. Here the architect in charge, John Simpson, a favourite of the Prince of Wales and designer of the new-look Queen's Picture Gallery at Buckingham Palace, has attempted to create an instant old-world village on the scale of a town. Although the houses are twee - their facades packed full of 18th-century-style incident - they are grouped in terraces, secreted down mews and gathered around tiny town squares. Within a couple of years pioneer settlers will be able to shop, go to church and drink in a pub in a brand-new, old-world market square. Simpson's drawings are delightful, whimsical things, but the reality is far less convincing. While it is possible to conjure a convincing-looking Quality Street townscape on paper, it is far harder to build it. And, unlike a traditional village, Fairford Leys seems to be aimed at people drawn from a narrow slice of English society. Furthermore, most will commute to work, many by car. </p> <p>The whole place strikes the visitor as false. The \"sash\" windows are not made of wood, nor do they slide up and down in the time-honoured fashion. They are coated in uPVC and open up and outwards. Not quite Georgian. Fanlights are built into doors instead of being set above them. A row of railway cottages is charming, but as there is no railway here, nor ever has been, why the conceit? Mews exist here, even though horses and carriages never have. Some flats are \"carved\" - as estate agents like to say - from what looks like a converted Victorian chapel but turns out to be a brand-new building masquerading as a conversion. And so it goes on: an implausible, stage-set world. </p> <p>A far cry from Churchill Gardens. Neither the Millennium Village, with its promise of an ecologically sound way of life, nor Fairford Leys, with its attempt at old-world charm, can beat this 50s estate in terms of economy: easy on land use, easy on the eye. Just as I was about to write this paragraph, a press release announcing the \"e.house\", the \"first steel-framed factory-built house in the UK to be assembled on a residential development ready for occupation and sale\" (at Port Regent estate, Eastbourne, East Sussex) landed on my desk. A real house for the future? Not a chance. The steel frame is clad in brick and the whole caboodle looks like any house in any cul-de-sac-filled suburb. Dear John Prescott. Dear Nick Raynsford. Please take a serious look at modern housing before we're all swamped with this village stuff - old, new and, however decent, always indifferent.</p>",
