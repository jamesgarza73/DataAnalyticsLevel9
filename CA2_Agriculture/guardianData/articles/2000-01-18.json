The letter emphasises the LMA's \"massive disappointment\" over the issue. \"This is totally unacceptable to us,\" Barnwell wrote. \"The least we expect now is some form of public censure from the government over the scheming actions of these MPs. Danny Wilson has dealt with the matter in a professional manner, which cannot be said of them.\" Nigeria have ruled out any chance of Nwankwo Kanu being released to play for Arsenal during the the African Nations Cup, which it is co-hosting with Ghana. The Nigeria Football Association claims the Gunners had asked for the striker to be made available between matches. \"Arsenal are irresponsible,\" said its chairman Anthony Williams. \"There's no way we are going to release Kanu.\" \u0095 Leeds United have signed Australia's Olympic goalkeeper Danny Milosevic from Perth Glory for \u00a3100,000. \u0095 The Argentina defender Jose Antonio Chamot has joined Milan from Atletico Madrid for \u00a32.3m on a 2-year contract.",

But is the promised expansion of higher education to the point where half of all 18- to 30-year-olds participate by 2009 to be paid for by the taxpayer and student fees? Or is it to be funded by squeezing the universities and their staff who have seen salaries decline by 30% in real terms? As the Association of University Teachers today publish their pay claim for a 30% catch-up rise over the period of the review, there is anxiety that universities will continue to have their costs forced down. Spending per student has been slashed by more than 40% in real terms in the past two decades, and currently the sector is required to make cuts of 1% a year. If sceptical Treasury officials have their way, students are likely to encounter bigger classes and less contact with tutors, more frustration in computer access and getting hold of books. The lecturers' unions and the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals have now made their cases to the department for education and employment, along with a myriad competing groups for education cash, and next month the department will put its bid to the Treasury. To back up its case, the CVCP has commissioned a study on how much research benefits the economy, and next month will publish a further study on staff recruitment and retention which it believes is becoming a problem. Four of the CVCP's five priority areas for investment relate to teaching, including maintaining the level of funding per head and improving staff pay and conditions. While the sector is uniting in calling for between \u00a34bn and \u00a35bn extra, divisions have opened up between the old universities and the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education, which represents staff in the new universities and higher education colleges. Tom Wilson, the union's higher education officer, pointed out large disparities in the amount of money for teaching in different universities, ranging from more than \u00a311,000 per head at University College London to \u00a33,200 at Luton. University heads dismissed this as simply a reflection of the different subject mix at old and new universities - an institution with a medical school and capital intensive science departments was bound to be more expensive than one with large numbers in business studies or vocational subjects.

The role of this book is simply to give you the facts and figures.\" But as with any shopping expedition, choosing a university or college is complex as there are so many facts and figures. </p> <p>Some institutions do demand much tougher A-level grades if you want to get onto their degree courses, but they may offer bettter chances of getting a good degree after three or four years of study. </p> <p>Others may be less stringent about entry qualifications but boast some of the country's best-staffed courses. Others produce some of the most employable graduates in the sector. </p> <p>The dilemmas being faced by the newly informed student customer are summed up by a look at the country's foremost academic universities - Oxford and Cambridge. </p> <p>The figures confirm the Oxbridge institutions as the hardest to get into: 99.5% of new students at Oxford and 99.6% of new students at Cambridge have higher than average A-level or Scottish Higher grades.

Even for institutions as similar as Oxford and Cambridge, the figures obscure subtle but significant differences in degree subjects. </p> <p>Disciplines, as the statistical guide reveals, are characterised by different A-level scores, degree results, employment prospects and student-staff ratios. A medical school, for example, is likely to improve the overall employment figures for a university because medical students face little difficulty finding jobs. </p> <p>Also, as the student-staff ratios compiled in the guide are based on university returns for teaching and research staff, research-oriented institutions are likely to look better, even though in many cases research staff have little interaction with students. </p> <p>The use of higher-education statistics is now one of the most sensitive issues for universities.

King's and Glasgow are part of small cluster of universities, also including Edinburgh, Nottingham, Oxford and Cambridge, where over 70% of undergraduates get first or upper-second class degrees. </p> <p>Yet Glasgow is the only university in the group which enrols less than four-fifths of students with above average A levels (18.3 points where A=10 and E=2) and Scottish Highers (16.3 points). While at King's this proportion is slighter higher, at 83.8%, the London university registers only 1.8% of its graduates as being unemployed six months after finishing degrees, less than any of the other institutions in the group. King's also benefits from one of the best student-staff ratios, with 10 students for every academic staff member. </p> <p>If, on the other hand, you are destined, for whatever reason, for less good A levels, or you have vocational qualifications instead, Bournemouth or Abertay Dundee may be the university for you. Among universities with the least demanding academic entry requirements are Abertay Dundee, Bournemouth, Greenwich, Luton, Paisley, South Bank and Thames Valley. Fewer than 10% of students enrolled at these institutions have higher than average A-levels or Scottish Highers. Yet at only Abertay, Paisley, and Bournemouth, do over two-fifths of graduates still leave university with first and upper-second degrees. </p> <p>On top of this, Bournemouth and Abertay both record under 7% of graduates on the dole after finishing university. The student customer should also be aware that degree subject is a big influence on academic and employment prospects. </p> <p>The guide reveals, for example, that for most humanities subjects more than 60% of graduates get first or upper-second degrees, compared with only about 50% of graduates in the physical sciences. </p> <p>Often 10% of graduates in the creative arts are on the dole after six months.

      "bodyText": "Whispered rumours that Leonardo DiCaprio is considering signing up to the next Star Wars prequel stepped up an octave last night as news broke that the Titanic star has been discussing the project with creator George Lucas. DiCaprio was spotted travelling to the film-maker's Skywalker ranch in California late last year, yet insisted that he was only visiting to attend a private screening of The Phantom Menace. But promoting his forthcoming role in The Beach on Entertainment Tonight, the 25 year-old actor admitted that he had already discussed the possibility of playing the teenage Anakin Skywalker with Lucas. DiCaprio confirmed that he would like to take the role, yet insisted that no firm decisions had yet been made. The casting of Lucas's Star Wars series is traditionally a heavily guarded process. When Ewan McGregor committed to The Phantom Menace back in 1997, he was asked to sign a contract promising to tell nobody of the decision, not even his wife. DiCaprio has long been tipped for a role in Lucas's next installment (provisionally titled Star Wars 2), yet most industry insiders felt him to be too old and established to play the part of Anakin Skywalker. Last November, a leaked Lucasfilm memo called for a 19-year-old actor who was \"self-determined, extremely intelligent, and forthright\". Speaking on CNN last week, George Lucas confessed that he was still finishing the script, with a view to starting production in the summer. \u0095 Star Wars 2 is tentatively scheduled for a US release in the summer of 2001.

But speculation that Gen Pinochet's release is a mere formality increased when the ministry of defence confirmed that a Chilean plane will fly into RAF Brize Norton sometime tomorrow. It will be used to take Gen Pinochet back to Chile if the extradition case against him is dropped. Amnesty International, the Redress Trust, the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture and the Relatives of the Disappeared in Chile lodged a written submission with the home office. They expressed concern that the decision would be based on secret medical evidence that \"may not reflect the General's true condition\". Amnesty spokesman Richard Bunting said its submission highlighted \"medical and legal concerns about Mr Straw's preliminary decision and the doctors' report on which it was based. \"Our submission contains independent expert medical opinion which we feel highlights deficiencies in the examination to which Gen Pinochet was subject,\" he said. He confirmed Amnesty was looking at the possibility of asking for a judicial review, but that would depend on how Mr Straw treated the submissions. In an afternoon statement, the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture said it had called on Mr Straw to reverse his provisional decision to release Gen Pinochet. It said all interested parties should have access to the medical reports on which Mr Straw based his decision, and should also have the right to conduct a fresh medical examination. In its representations, the organisation challenged the suggestion that medical evidence about the general could not be made public because of doctor-patient confidentiality considerations. The Foundation also complained that the medical team which examined the Gen Pinochet did not include anyone with specific expertise in dementia. In letters accompanying the Foundation's representations, Dr Robert Howard, of the Institute of Psychiatry at the Maudsley Hospital in London, and Dr Nori Graham, president of the International Alzheimer's Society - both eminent old-age psychiatrists - stated that the medical tests to which Pinochet was apparently subjected were insufficient to arrive at a diagnosis of dementia. Ms Bamber said: \"To allow Gen Pinochet home now without giving all interested parties the chance to examine the evidence, and conduct new tests, would be to fly in the face of natural justice, and make a mockery of the continued suffering of the thousands of people tortured and bereaved by his regime.\"",

Anxiety about a possible bid depressed the grocer's share price, even though it said margins had been maintained and like-for-like sales in Britain were up a respectable 5.5% in the seven weeks to January 8. Claiming to be the world's largest internet grocer, Tesco said it had experienced a ten-fold increase in e-sales over last year, and now had 250,000 regular e-shoppers. The retailer - which at present offers its online service from 100 stores in London, the south-east, the M1 corridor and Newcastle - will roll out the service throughout the UK later this year. The online shop - which for the first time at Christmas included books, gifts and homeware - is already making a profit for Tesco, which is able to service around 2,000 e-shoppers from each store. Its Tesco personal finance operation, a joint venture with Royal Bank of Scotland, is also available on the internet. The group said overall sales for the 21 weeks since its half-year results had increased by 10.2%, while total like-for-like sales in the seven weeks to January 8 were up 11.8%. It pointed to a \"strong\" performance in its British operation, diversification away from food and expansion overseas as helping to fuel the growth in sales. It claimed its market share in the UK was continuing to increase, and said 17m shoppers had visited its stores in the week before Christmas, compared with a more usual 12.5m average number. \"In the week leading up to Christmas we served over 17m customers who welcomed our price cuts and enjoyed the cheapest Christmas for years,\" Tesco said. The group made \u00a3380m of price cuts last year, which might have helped sales in comparison with Sainsbury, which last week reported like-for-like sales up by 2% in the 12 weeks to January 8 - although Morrison, operating from a smaller base, reported a 15.1% rise in sales and Safeway a 6% rise.

He says the book alleges he has distorted statistics and documents to serve his own ideological purposes and reach historically untenable conclusions.</p> <p>The author of Hitler's War says he has never claimed that the Holocaust did not take place. He does, however, question the number of Jewish dead and denies there was a systematic extermination of Jews in concentration camp gas chambers.</p> <p>Mr Rampton asked him what the hundreds of thousands of Jews transported to \"little villages in the middle of nowhere\" on the Russian border in eastern Poland in 1942 were going to do there.</p> <p>Mr Irving replied: \"The documents do not tell me.\"</p> <p>Counsel asked him to try to construct in his own mind a convincing explanation. Mr Irving said: \"There could be any number of convincing explanations.

      "bodyText": "No \"sane\" person could conclude that hundreds of thousands of Jews were transported to the middle of nowhere on the Russian border during World War Two to \"restore their health\", the high court Holocaust libel trial was told today. Richard Rampton QC, defending American academic Deborah Lipstadt and Penguin Books against a libel claim brought against them by historian David Irving, told the court in London that anyone making such a suggestion was either \"mad or a liar\". Mr Rampton made his comments during his cross-examination of 62-year-old Mr Irving, who claims that Professor Lipstadt's 1994 book, Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory, has generated waves of hatred against him. Mr Irving is suing over a claim that he is a \"Holocaust denier\". He says the book alleges he has distorted statistics and documents to serve his own ideological purposes and reach historically untenable conclusions. The author of Hitler's War says he has never claimed that the Holocaust did not take place. He does, however, question the number of Jewish dead and denies there was a systematic extermination of Jews in concentration camp gas chambers. Mr Rampton asked him what the hundreds of thousands of Jews transported to \"little villages in the middle of nowhere\" on the Russian border in eastern Poland in 1942 were going to do there. Mr Irving replied: \"The documents do not tell me.\" Counsel asked him to try to construct in his own mind a convincing explanation. Mr Irving said: \"There could be any number of convincing explanations. What is the point of that exercise?\" Mr Rampton said it was to \"show the scale of the operation and in due course to demonstrate that anybody who suggests that these hundreds of thousands of Jews were sent to these tiny villages in order to restore their health is either mad or a liar\". Mr Rampton told Mr Justice Gray that Mr Irving's position on what happened at those villages on the Russian border - Treblinka, Sobibor and Belzec - appeared to be an acceptance that hundreds of thousands of Jews were intentionally killed at those places, \"but not as the consequence of any policy or system\" and that he was not satisfied \"that was their dedicated purpose\". Mr Irving told the judge, who is hearing the case without a jury, that this was \"a very fair summary\" of his position. The hearing was adjourned until tomorrow.",

Letizia Moratti, who is based in Milan, and the Guardian Media Group - owner of the Guardian newspaper - are the two largest shareholders in Spectrum Venture Management, which completed its first round of financing two weeks ago and is on target to raise a total of \u00a335m by the end of the year. Ms Moratti, 50, is known as a consummate networker and was described by Mr Murdoch as \"a distinguished citizen ... known throughout the broadcasting establishment in Europe\" before their disagreement about the company's strategic direction in September last year, when she resigned as president of News Corporation Europe. Prior to working for Mr Murdoch she was chairman of Italian public broadcaster RAI. Ms Moratti will act as an adviser to SVM, which hopes to invest in around eight net related start-ups each year and then help them devise strategies and business plans. The impetus behind the fund has come from London-based Spectrum Strategy Consultants, which specialises in the internet and converging communication systems. Spectrum's board is chaired by Lord Puttnam; its deputy chairman is Don Cruickshank, who is overseeing the government review of the banking sector. The founders of the online travel and entertainment firm, Lastminute.com - Brent Hoberman and Martha-Lane Fox - both previously worked for Spectrum. Ross Fitzgerald, managing director of SVM, said: \"As the first year marketing costs to successfully build internet businesses escalate beyond 10m, it is critical for entrepreneurs to rapidly create win-win marketing alliances with strategic corporates. \"SVM will provide its investee companies with access to Spectrum's worldwide network of corporate contacts to reduce marketing expenditure by up to a third.\" Bob Phillis, the chief executive of Guardian Media Group, said: \"We are delighted to be one of the founder investors in Spectrums' new fund. \"We view our participation as being an important part of our group's ambitious internet growth strategy.\" Around 40% of the Spectrum group's investment is likely to be made in business to consumer start-ups, with the remainder in business to business companies.",

      "byline": "Sarah Hall  and Lucy Ward",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The government will today publish proposals to ban parents from smacking their children on the head or face, or from using belts or other implements to inflict physical punishment.</p> <p>A consultation document, Protecting Children; Supporting Parents, will stop short of proposing a ban on smacking, but will recommend handing courts new powers to punish parents for hitting children.</p> <p>Under the proposals, courts will be asked to decide what constitutes \"reasonable chastisement\". They will be told to take four criteria into account, including whether implements - such as a slipper, cane, stick or belt - were used to hit the child. Courts will have to consider the age and sex of the child, the duration of the punishment and where on the body the child was hit.</p> <p>Options in the document include banning all hitting of a child around the head and the use of implements.</p> <p>A further option will be to remove the defence of reasonable chastisement in incidents which cause bruising or black eyes. The thrust of the document will be geared towards the courts, reflecting government fears of accusations of a nanny state seeking to march into parents' living rooms.</p> <p>A government source said last night: \"There is no option under consideration of making smacking illegal - parents want to see the law tightened to protect children but they don't want guidance on the minutiae of disciplining children. We have tried to draw a careful line between two extremes.\"</p> <p>A spokeswoman at the department of health said: \"The whole document looks at where the child should be hit, questions whether or not a child should be hit with a particular implement and looks at the whole concept of 'reasonable chastisement' - how to define this and what constitutes 'excessive force'.</p> <p>\"There's no age limit mentioned anywhere at all.\"</p> <p>The plans, to be unveiled today by John Hutton, health minister, are the result of a 16-month consultation prompted by a European court of human rights ruling that British law on corporal punishment in the home failed to protect the rights of children.</p> <p>The finding, based on the case of a nine-year-old boy caned with a three-foot pole by his stepfather, contradicted a law, dating from 1860, which allows parents to hit children if they claim they are practising \"reasonable chastisement\". Juries frequently acquit parents who belt and cane their children: in the case of the nine-year-old, the stepfather was found not guilty of assault causing actual bodily harm.</p> <p>After the judgment, in September 1998, the government was obliged to alter the law on the right to beat one's children. But the then health minister, Paul Boateng, was adamant that there would be no ban on smacking, though eight other EU countries have such bans. \"This government believes in parental discipline. Smacking has a place within that and our law will not change in order to outlaw it,\" he said.</p> <p>Children's societies and anti-smacking campaigners are distressed that he has stuck by his pledge without even moot ing a total ban as an option.</p> <p>\"Of course, these proposals are fantastic for children who are caned on their bottoms because this will prevent this, or for children who are beaten with hands elsewhere,\" said Rachel Hodgkin, spokeswoman for the Children are Unbeatable campaign, spearheaded by Barnardo's, the National Children's Bureau, the NSPCC, Save the Children, and the group Epoch (End Physical Punishment of Children).</p> <p>\"But it's also disturbing that these proposals still give out the message that hitting a child is OK: what do children learn from that?\"</p> <p>The charities also pointed to statistics revealing that at least one child dies in Britain every week aftert being assaulted by an adult. In Sweden, where corporal punishment has been illegal for more than 20 years, four children have died from being beaten in this period.</p> <p>But the shadow health secretary, Dr Liam Fox, attacked \"Labour's obsessive nannying\". \"Smacking children to teach them the difference between right and wrong is often a necessary, if painful, task,\" he said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The government will today publish proposals to ban parents from smacking their children on the head or face, or from using belts or other implements to inflict physical punishment. A consultation document, Protecting Children; Supporting Parents, will stop short of proposing a ban on smacking, but will recommend handing courts new powers to punish parents for hitting children. Under the proposals, courts will be asked to decide what constitutes \"reasonable chastisement\". They will be told to take four criteria into account, including whether implements - such as a slipper, cane, stick or belt - were used to hit the child. Courts will have to consider the age and sex of the child, the duration of the punishment and where on the body the child was hit. Options in the document include banning all hitting of a child around the head and the use of implements. A further option will be to remove the defence of reasonable chastisement in incidents which cause bruising or black eyes. The thrust of the document will be geared towards the courts, reflecting government fears of accusations of a nanny state seeking to march into parents' living rooms. A government source said last night: \"There is no option under consideration of making smacking illegal - parents want to see the law tightened to protect children but they don't want guidance on the minutiae of disciplining children. We have tried to draw a careful line between two extremes.\" A spokeswoman at the department of health said: \"The whole document looks at where the child should be hit, questions whether or not a child should be hit with a particular implement and looks at the whole concept of 'reasonable chastisement' - how to define this and what constitutes 'excessive force'. \"There's no age limit mentioned anywhere at all.\" The plans, to be unveiled today by John Hutton, health minister, are the result of a 16-month consultation prompted by a European court of human rights ruling that British law on corporal punishment in the home failed to protect the rights of children. The finding, based on the case of a nine-year-old boy caned with a three-foot pole by his stepfather, contradicted a law, dating from 1860, which allows parents to hit children if they claim they are practising \"reasonable chastisement\". Juries frequently acquit parents who belt and cane their children: in the case of the nine-year-old, the stepfather was found not guilty of assault causing actual bodily harm. After the judgment, in September 1998, the government was obliged to alter the law on the right to beat one's children. But the then health minister, Paul Boateng, was adamant that there would be no ban on smacking, though eight other EU countries have such bans. \"This government believes in parental discipline. Smacking has a place within that and our law will not change in order to outlaw it,\" he said. Children's societies and anti-smacking campaigners are distressed that he has stuck by his pledge without even moot ing a total ban as an option. \"Of course, these proposals are fantastic for children who are caned on their bottoms because this will prevent this, or for children who are beaten with hands elsewhere,\" said Rachel Hodgkin, spokeswoman for the Children are Unbeatable campaign, spearheaded by Barnardo's, the National Children's Bureau, the NSPCC, Save the Children, and the group Epoch (End Physical Punishment of Children). \"But it's also disturbing that these proposals still give out the message that hitting a child is OK: what do children learn from that?\" The charities also pointed to statistics revealing that at least one child dies in Britain every week aftert being assaulted by an adult. In Sweden, where corporal punishment has been illegal for more than 20 years, four children have died from being beaten in this period. But the shadow health secretary, Dr Liam Fox, attacked \"Labour's obsessive nannying\". \"Smacking children to teach them the difference between right and wrong is often a necessary, if painful, task,\" he said.",

      "body": "<b>Alliance aims and statement</b> <p>The organisations listed below welcome the Government's intention to clarify the law on parental discipline. The traditional defence of \"reasonable chastisement\" works against the aims which we and the Government of a modern Britain share: the encouragement of positive parental discipline in all families, and assurance of effective child protection in the few cases where it is needed. </p> <p>We believe it is both wrong and impracticable to seek to define acceptable forms of corporal punishment of children. Such an exercise is unjust. Hitting children is a lesson in bad behaviour.</p> <p>Removing the defence of \"reasonable chastisement\" and thus giving children in their homes and in all other settings equal protection under the law on assault is the only just, moral and safe way to clarify the law. While technically this would criminalise any assault of a child, trivial assaults, like trivial assaults between adults, would not be prosecuted. There already exist adequate means to prevent unwarranted or unhelpful prosecutions. It would on the other hand ease prosecution in serious cases. It would eliminate the current dangerous confusion over what is acceptable and provide a clear basis for child protection.</p> <p>There is ample evidence from other countries to show that full legal reform, coupled with the promotion of effective means of positive discipline, works rapidly to reduce reliance on corporal punishment and reduces the need for prosecutions and other formal interventions in families. Using positive forms of discipline reduces stress and improves relationships between children, their parents and other carers.</p> <p> Aberlour Child Care Trust<br>\u0095 Action for Sick Children<br>\u0095 ADHD Family Support Group UK <br>\u0095 Adlerian Society (of the United Kingdom) and <br>\u0095 the Institute for Individual Psychology<br>\u0095 Adolescent and Children's Trust, The<br>\u0095 Advisory Centre for Education <br>\u0095 African Caribbean Family Mediation Service <br>\u0095 After Adoption<br>\u0095 Alliance of Parents &amp; Schools, The<br>\u0095 Anna Freud Centre, The<br>\u0095 Antidote: Campaign for Emotional Literacy<br>\u0095 Article 12<br>\u0095 Article 31 Action Network<br>\u0095 Association for Family Therapy<br>\u0095 Association of Advisers for Under Eights and <br>\u0095 their Families - AAUEF<br>\u0095 Association of Lawyers for Children<br>\u0095 Barnardo's<br>\u0095 BAWSO Women's Aid - Black Association of<br>\u0095 Women Step Out Ltd.<br>\u0095 Behaviour Management Ltd.<br>\u0095 \"Being Yourself\"/Parenting Press Ltd.<br>\u0095 Bottesford Youth Town Council<br>\u0095 Boys and Girls Welfare Society<br>\u0095 Bridge Child Care Development Service, The<br>\u0095 Bristol Early Years &amp; Childcare Partnership<br>\u0095 British Agencies for Adoption and Fostering UK<br>\u0095 - BAAF<br>\u0095 British Association for Community Child Health<br>\u0095 - BACCH<br>\u0095 British Association for Early Childhood <br>\u0095 Education - Early Education<br>\u0095 British Association for the Study &amp; Prevention of<br>\u0095 Child Abuse &amp; Neglect - BASPCAN <br>\u0095 British Association of Psychotherapists, Child &amp;<br>\u0095 Adolescent Training Committee<br>\u0095 British Association of Social Workers - BASW<br>\u0095 British Epilepsy Association<br>\u0095 British Juvenile and Family Courts Society<br>\u0095 Cambridgeshire Probation Service (Family <br>\u0095 Court Welfare Service)<br>\u0095 Canterbury Children's Centre<br>\u0095 Carers National Association<br>\u0095 Caring for Children<br>\u0095 Catholic Child Welfare Council<br>\u0095 Catholic Children's Society (Arundel &amp; Brighton,<br>\u0095 Portsmouth and Southwark)<br>\u0095 Catholic Children's Society (R.C.

      "bodyText": "Alliance aims and statement The organisations listed below welcome the Government's intention to clarify the law on parental discipline. The traditional defence of \"reasonable chastisement\" works against the aims which we and the Government of a modern Britain share: the encouragement of positive parental discipline in all families, and assurance of effective child protection in the few cases where it is needed. We believe it is both wrong and impracticable to seek to define acceptable forms of corporal punishment of children. Such an exercise is unjust. Hitting children is a lesson in bad behaviour. Removing the defence of \"reasonable chastisement\" and thus giving children in their homes and in all other settings equal protection under the law on assault is the only just, moral and safe way to clarify the law. While technically this would criminalise any assault of a child, trivial assaults, like trivial assaults between adults, would not be prosecuted. There already exist adequate means to prevent unwarranted or unhelpful prosecutions. It would on the other hand ease prosecution in serious cases. It would eliminate the current dangerous confusion over what is acceptable and provide a clear basis for child protection. There is ample evidence from other countries to show that full legal reform, coupled with the promotion of effective means of positive discipline, works rapidly to reduce reliance on corporal punishment and reduces the need for prosecutions and other formal interventions in families. Using positive forms of discipline reduces stress and improves relationships between children, their parents and other carers.

      "body": "<p> <strong>Australia</strong></p> <p>Michael Kasprowicz had match figures of 10-88 as Queensland thrashed Tasmania at the Allan Border Field in Brisbane, to move ahead of Victoria and claim the outright lead in the Pura Milk Cup. Kasprowicz followed up 5-56 in the first innings with figures of 24-11-32-5 as Tasmania collapsed twice. In between, Queensland debutant Clinton Perren, 24, a product of the Australian Cricket Academy, struck 153.</p> <p> <strong>Tasmania</strong>130 and 155 (Michael Di Venuto 50) <strong>Queensland</strong> 365 (Stuart Law 53) <strong>Queensland won by an innings and 80 runs</strong><br></p> <p>Justin Langer was in the runs as Western Australia won a nail-biting clash against South Australia at Perth by three wickets. Langer began by hitting 120 in the first innings, adding 227 for the second wicket with opener Michael Hussey, who carried his bat for 172. Then, after Ben Johnson had made 104 for SA, Langer scored 77 as WA chased 256 for victory. WA were in trouble at 206 for 7, but Matt Nicholson held his nerve to make 30*. </p> <p> <strong>South Australia</strong>330 and 317 (Greg Blewett 76) <strong>Western Australia</strong> 392 and 256 for 7 <strong>Western Australia won by 3 wickets</strong></p> <p> Langer shone again with 146 off 148 balls in the Mercantile Mutual Cup game with South Australia at the WACA, but WA still lost by 33 runs to miss the chance to go top. Chasing a massive 303 to win, WA reached 151 for 3 in the 30th over, but fell away as no other batsman passed 30.</p> <p> <strong>Tasmania</strong>130 and 155 (Michael Di Venuto 50) <strong>Queensland</strong> 365 (Stuart Law 53) <strong>Queensland won by an innings and 80 runs</strong><br></p> <p> New South Wales, bottom of the Pura Milk Cup, took advantage of WA's slip-up and stole first place with an easy win against whipping-boys Canberra.</p> <p> <strong>New South Wales</strong>252 for 9 in 47 overs <strong>Canberra</strong> 136 <strong>New South Wales won by 116 runs</strong></p> <p> <strong>South Africa</strong></p> <p>West Indian Vasbert Drakes continued his fine form for Boland, but his side still went down to an eight-wicket defeat against Border at Paarl. Drakes began with 52 as he helped Boland recover from 32 for 7 to 110 all out, and then claimed 5-26 to make Boland struggle themselves.

      "bodyText": "Baltimore Technologies, the internet security firm which was one of last year's best performers on the stock market, made its first acquisition in the United States yesterday with the $150m (\u00a392m) purchase of GTE CyberTrust. The company's share price in London - which rose by more than 1,000% last year - gained another 20% yesterday to close at \u00a367.50. The Dublin-based company entered the FTSE 250 towards the end of last year and is now worth \u00a32.7bn. The e-security industry is expected to grow exponentially over the coming years as companies become increasingly concerned about online confidentiality. Large corporations want much more sophisticated security systems which demand more than simple passwords to accept users. Paddy Holahan, marketing director for Baltimore, said the all-share acquisition of CyberTrust gave the company the necessary scale to compete in the US market. \"As the deals got larger and larger we needed scale in the US to take on new projects,\" he said. CyberTrust's clients include American Express, Mastercard and Deutsche Telekom. Baltimore - which is also listed on Nasdaq - made a loss of $39.2m in the first nine months of last year on turnover of $25.6m, compared with a loss of $33m on revenues of $15m for CyberTrust.",

      "trailText": "<p>David Irving may be isolated in his high court battle, but a growing number of respectable academics are criticising what they have dubbed the 'Holocaust industry'.</p>",
      "byline": "David Cesarani",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>At times during his legal battle in the high court, David Irving, a man of natural military bearing, resembles a beleaguered Wehrmacht general in some god-forsaken pocket on the eastern front, desperately trying to beat off the Jewish-Bolshevik hordes. At least, one suspects, that is rather how he sees it. </p> <p>He stands or sits alone on one side of the courtroom, while the large defence team occupies most of the rest of it. In his opening statement he referred several times to the existence of an \"international endeavour\" to destroy his name and career as a writer. He menacingly promised that \"the Jewish community, their fame and fortunes, play a central role in these proceedings\". </p> <p>Lest there be any doubt about that particular role, he avers that he was \"the target of a hidden international attempt\" to silence him. Naming names, Irving has pointed the finger at the American Jewish Anti-Defamation League and its equivalents in Britain, Canada, and Australia. Bizarre as they may be, these accusations will resonate beyond the odd collection of his supporters huddled in the Irving corner of the public gallery. </p> <p>To the young man clad in a black parka, black roll-top sweater, black trousers and black baseball cap sitting among them, the notion, no matter how paranoid, of an international Jewish conspiracy to destroy a hero of the far right will appear just so much common sense. Rather more worryingly, it may feed into the growing backlash against the so-called \"Holocaust industry\" which, for very different reasons, is taking hold in mainstream media and academic circles. </p> <p>Few reasonable people will dispute the right of Jews in this country and elsewhere to join forces with other Jews, as well as legions of non-Jewish anti-fascists, in opposing neo-nazism and the Holocaust denial that is associated with it. But some are questioning whether memorialisation of the Holocaust, as well as Holocaust studies in schools and universities, are not being used wrongly, or simply getting out of hand. </p> <p>While Irving disputes the accepted facts of the Holocaust, posing as the victim of powerful forces with a vested interest in the established version, serious writers on both sides of the Atlantic who scorn his methods and arguments are questioning the purposes to which the Holocaust is being put. They are asking if it deserves a special, protected place in the public consciousness. </p> <p>The government's announcement in October 1999 that it was considering the establishment of a Holocaust Memorial Day in the UK gave evidence both of the heightened intensity of Holocaust awareness and the reaction to it. Richard Ingrams in the Observer complained that \"not a day goes by without the Holocaust being mentioned in one context or another\". </p> <p>Earlier in the year the announcement that the Imperial War Museum North was planning a joint venture with the Manchester Shoah Centre provoked Brian Sewell in the Evening Standard to condemn the \"bandwagon\" effect. \"Can we not say to the Jews of Manchester,\" he asked, \"that enough has been made of their Holocaust and they are too greedy for our memories.\" </p> <p>Most recently, Sam Schulman in the Spectator warned that \"a new kind of anti-semitism may emerge in the 21st century, in reaction to the attempt to make 'the Holocaust' central to our civilisation.\" As with all such journalistic provocations there is more than an element of the self-fulfilling prophecy, but the critique is not confined to columnists hungry for a topic that will trigger an avalanche of letters to the editor. </p> <p>In 1999, Tim Cole, a British academic responsible for ground-breaking research on the wartime Budapest ghetto, published Images of the Holocaust: the Myth of the \"Shoah Business\", which slammed the redemptive and kitschy representation of the Holocaust seen in films and museums the world over. He dubbed this, perhaps foolishly, the \"myth\" of the Holocaust. </p> <p>It is not hard to show that what we know as the Holocaust, or Shoah, is a narrative that was constructed over the years and only gained popular currency from the late 60s onwards. Cole, building on the work of US scholar James Young, argues that the Holocaust is invested with different meanings depending on the society in which it is recalled. As Young showed, it helps to tell a nation's story through the Jewish experience. </p> <p>But Cole singles out the use of exhibitions and memorials to combat Holocaust denial. \"Museums such as the US Holocaust Memorial Museum and movies such as Schindler's List have as a self- conscious goal not simply teaching the public lessons from the past, but also the aim of disproving the claims of those who deny the Holocaust.\" </p> <p>In his eyes this is a mistake, since \"it amounts to attempting to counter the questioning of the reality of the 'Holocaust' by offering in its place a representation of the 'Holocaust' which only tends to blur the critical distinction between reality and representation\". Worse, it's self-defeating: \"It was not until it emerged as an iconic event that it was perceived to be an event which was deemed to be worth denying.\" Mem-orialisation provokes denial. </p> <p>The intellectual backlash has been more prominent and problematic in the US. Next month will see the publication in Britain of The Holocaust In American Life by the respected US historian Peter Novick, in which he maintains that \"it was Jewish initiative that put the Holocaust on the American agenda\". The story of Jewish martyrdom was used by American Jewish leaders from the 70s on to provide a narrative that could unite the diverse American-Jewish community and deter assimilation, he argues. It was also a handy way to clobber anti-semitism and justify US support for Israel. </p> <p>Novick uncovered many policy statements by leaders of the American Jewish Committee, the American Jewish Congress and the Anti-Defamation League to sustain his thesis.

It became fashionable to be a hyphenated American. This \"particularism\" enabled American-Jews, and specifically Holocaust survivors, to tell their stories for the first time. Moreover, their experience harmonised with America's self-image as a sanctuary for history's victims. Victimhood proved especially useful to American Jews who wanted to defend their privileges against other ethnic groups, notably African-Americans, without appearing too powerful or greedy. </p> <p>Americans accepted the prioritisation of the Holocaust because it made them feel good: they stood shoulder to shoulder with the people who had endured the worst of the 20th century. Remembering genocide in a \"warm glow of virtue\" became a vicarious alternative to actually doing anything about it. </p> <p>These arguments are echoed in a more reductive form by Norman Finkelstein in his forthcoming book The Holocaust Industry, which was prefigured by his hostile review of Daniel Goldhagen's Hitler's Willing Executioners in the New Left Review in mid-1997. Finkelstein, a left-wing and anti-Zionist political scientist, claims that the \"Holocaust industry\" was created by the pro-Israel lobby in the US after 1967 to justify aid for Israel. \"'The Holocaust' is in effect the Zionist account of the Nazi holocaust.

These themes lay at the heart of Jim Allen's 1987 play Perdition, tellingly resurrected last year. In this drama, based coincidentally on a libel trial, the defence counsel argues that \"Israel is a paid watchdog: a nation built on the pillar of Western guilt and subsidised by American dollars.\" </p> <p>Similar reasoning was located on the far right. It found expression in Irving's introduction to the Leuchter Report, which purported to show that there were no gas chambers at Auschwitz. According to Irving, \"Since 1949 the state of Israel has received over DM90bn in voluntary reparations from West Germany, essentially in atonement for the 'gas chambers of Auschwitz'\", which he declared a \"myth\". </p> <p>Of course, there is a world of difference between this and the unease felt in many quarters about the prominence of the Holocaust in society, culture and politics today. But in their efforts to chart the origins of the \"Holocaust industry\", its critics fall into the trap of ascribing too much influence and power to the Jews, while the motives they ascribe to Jewish organisations are reductive and harmful. </p> <p>The Holocaust is the object of fascination today not just because it is a gripping chapter of history, but because it has stunning contemporary relevance. In a Europe that has recently witnessed \"ethnic cleansing\", the past has become the present. As events in Rwanda showed, genocide is not just a matter of academic research. The routine violation of human rights and the benighted treatment of refugees inevitably evoke past experiences and call for these to be studied and, with respect for all the crucial variations of scale and character, recalled as a warning. </p> <p>For it is too easy to dismiss reference to the Holocaust as an easy way of demarcating good and evil. The issues that the Holocaust throws up, such as racism, eugenics and biological politics, are precisely the dilemmas we face today. It was for this reason that the British historian Michael Burleigh concluded his study of Nazi \"euthanasia\" policies, Death and Deliverance, with a passionate discussion of what the Australian philosopher Peter Singer currently says about the right to life. </p> <p>In the global marketplace of moral values, the Holocaust seems one instance of applied evil that everyone can agree about. The globalisation of media has made the Holocaust a ubiquitous subject, not the other way round. </p> <p> The struggle for compensation for slave and forced labourers of the Nazi era would not have won such support were it not, partly at least, for the inclination to hold multinational corporations to account for their treatment of employees.

Such interest hardly existed a few years ago. </p> <p>Most importantly, the impatience with Holocaust memorialisation rests on a continuing, stubborn resentment of Jewish difference. Behind Peter Novick's criticism of \"particularism\" is an assimilationist agenda. In Finkelstein's anti-Zionism this is quite explicit.

      "bodyText": "At times during his legal battle in the high court, David Irving, a man of natural military bearing, resembles a beleaguered Wehrmacht general in some god-forsaken pocket on the eastern front, desperately trying to beat off the Jewish-Bolshevik hordes. At least, one suspects, that is rather how he sees it. He stands or sits alone on one side of the courtroom, while the large defence team occupies most of the rest of it. In his opening statement he referred several times to the existence of an \"international endeavour\" to destroy his name and career as a writer. He menacingly promised that \"the Jewish community, their fame and fortunes, play a central role in these proceedings\". Lest there be any doubt about that particular role, he avers that he was \"the target of a hidden international attempt\" to silence him. Naming names, Irving has pointed the finger at the American Jewish Anti-Defamation League and its equivalents in Britain, Canada, and Australia. Bizarre as they may be, these accusations will resonate beyond the odd collection of his supporters huddled in the Irving corner of the public gallery. To the young man clad in a black parka, black roll-top sweater, black trousers and black baseball cap sitting among them, the notion, no matter how paranoid, of an international Jewish conspiracy to destroy a hero of the far right will appear just so much common sense. Rather more worryingly, it may feed into the growing backlash against the so-called \"Holocaust industry\" which, for very different reasons, is taking hold in mainstream media and academic circles. Few reasonable people will dispute the right of Jews in this country and elsewhere to join forces with other Jews, as well as legions of non-Jewish anti-fascists, in opposing neo-nazism and the Holocaust denial that is associated with it. But some are questioning whether memorialisation of the Holocaust, as well as Holocaust studies in schools and universities, are not being used wrongly, or simply getting out of hand. While Irving disputes the accepted facts of the Holocaust, posing as the victim of powerful forces with a vested interest in the established version, serious writers on both sides of the Atlantic who scorn his methods and arguments are questioning the purposes to which the Holocaust is being put. They are asking if it deserves a special, protected place in the public consciousness. The government's announcement in October 1999 that it was considering the establishment of a Holocaust Memorial Day in the UK gave evidence both of the heightened intensity of Holocaust awareness and the reaction to it. Richard Ingrams in the Observer complained that \"not a day goes by without the Holocaust being mentioned in one context or another\". Earlier in the year the announcement that the Imperial War Museum North was planning a joint venture with the Manchester Shoah Centre provoked Brian Sewell in the Evening Standard to condemn the \"bandwagon\" effect. \"Can we not say to the Jews of Manchester,\" he asked, \"that enough has been made of their Holocaust and they are too greedy for our memories.\" Most recently, Sam Schulman in the Spectator warned that \"a new kind of anti-semitism may emerge in the 21st century, in reaction to the attempt to make 'the Holocaust' central to our civilisation.\" As with all such journalistic provocations there is more than an element of the self-fulfilling prophecy, but the critique is not confined to columnists hungry for a topic that will trigger an avalanche of letters to the editor. In 1999, Tim Cole, a British academic responsible for ground-breaking research on the wartime Budapest ghetto, published Images of the Holocaust: the Myth of the \"Shoah Business\", which slammed the redemptive and kitschy representation of the Holocaust seen in films and museums the world over. He dubbed this, perhaps foolishly, the \"myth\" of the Holocaust. It is not hard to show that what we know as the Holocaust, or Shoah, is a narrative that was constructed over the years and only gained popular currency from the late 60s onwards. Cole, building on the work of US scholar James Young, argues that the Holocaust is invested with different meanings depending on the society in which it is recalled. As Young showed, it helps to tell a nation's story through the Jewish experience. But Cole singles out the use of exhibitions and memorials to combat Holocaust denial. \"Museums such as the US Holocaust Memorial Museum and movies such as Schindler's List have as a self- conscious goal not simply teaching the public lessons from the past, but also the aim of disproving the claims of those who deny the Holocaust.\" In his eyes this is a mistake, since \"it amounts to attempting to counter the questioning of the reality of the 'Holocaust' by offering in its place a representation of the 'Holocaust' which only tends to blur the critical distinction between reality and representation\". Worse, it's self-defeating: \"It was not until it emerged as an iconic event that it was perceived to be an event which was deemed to be worth denying.\" Mem-orialisation provokes denial. The intellectual backlash has been more prominent and problematic in the US. Next month will see the publication in Britain of The Holocaust In American Life by the respected US historian Peter Novick, in which he maintains that \"it was Jewish initiative that put the Holocaust on the American agenda\". The story of Jewish martyrdom was used by American Jewish leaders from the 70s on to provide a narrative that could unite the diverse American-Jewish community and deter assimilation, he argues. It was also a handy way to clobber anti-semitism and justify US support for Israel. Novick uncovered many policy statements by leaders of the American Jewish Committee, the American Jewish Congress and the Anti-Defamation League to sustain his thesis. He was on more speculative ground when it came to explaining the receptivity of American society to a tale of Jewish misery in Europe, although this was the most interesting part of his argument. The 60s saw the end of the melting-pot ethos in American society and the rise of the \"new ethnicity\". It became fashionable to be a hyphenated American. This \"particularism\" enabled American-Jews, and specifically Holocaust survivors, to tell their stories for the first time. Moreover, their experience harmonised with America's self-image as a sanctuary for history's victims. Victimhood proved especially useful to American Jews who wanted to defend their privileges against other ethnic groups, notably African-Americans, without appearing too powerful or greedy.

If Ken is going to win whatever happens, they could, at least, make sure that dear old Dobbo doesn't lose. Fearing humiliation if Dobson is defeated by the process that was designed to enable him to win, sources close to Blair suggest that they are planning to cut their losses by encouraging him to quit. Instead of an embarrassing and damaging defeat, they will just have an embarrassing victory to contend with. Ken will win, much less excitingly, and although it will symbolise the rupture between New Labour and the people, at least the people won't be laughing in the streets.",

Violent crimes were up with a huge increase in the number of robberies, which showed a 19% rise compared with a fall of nearly 6% over the previous 12 months. Most of the robberies were muggings, and major crime rises were recorded in some of Britain's biggest cities. Overall, in the 12 months ending September 1999, police in England and Wales recorded a total of 5.2 million offences - an increase of 2.2% compared with the previous 12 months. Home secretary Jack Straw said: \"The government is committed to cutting the long-term growth in crime. \"Although crime has risen slightly in the 12 months to September 1999, today's figures show a dramatic variation in crime rates across the country.\" Violent crime up Violent crime saw its largest rise of 6.3% since 1995/1996 when attacks increased by 10%, according to the figures. They account for 13% of all recorded offences at 663,800, compared to 624,500 the previous year and include attacks, sex offences and robbery. Sexual offences showed a rise of 2.2%, which was less than the average increase during the last 10 years. Recorded rapes have increased sharply partly owing to a growing willingness by women to report the crimes. Sexual offences, theft and criminal damage were all up with fraud and forgery showing a near 30% increase. The only falls were for burglary, drug offences and theft of or from vehicles, according to the home office statistics. Total property crime, which makes up 84% of the crime figures with 4.4 million offences, increased by 2% after a fall in the previous five years. Crime by region The figures are broken down into divisional areas of police forces for the first time, showing the biggest rise in crime - 22% - recorded by the city of London force. This is followed by the West Midlands force, where recorded crime increased by 16%, and Bedfordshire, up by 12%. The breakdown in the figures showed that there were more attacks on people per head of population in the Bishopsgate area of central London than any other place in England and Wales.

It again showed that only 4,211 people lived there. The figures showed 24 forces - more than half of the total - cut crime, although that was fewer than the year before. But the bad figures recorded in major urban areas meant that there was a total rise in crime across England and Wales. Britain's largest force, the Metropolitan police, saw its total number of offences top the million mark with an 80,000, or 9%, rise in offences. Of the metropolitan forces only two showed crime cuts, West Yorkshire and Northumbria which achieved its seventh consecutive fall. The prime minister's spokesman defended the decision to publish a closer breakdown yesterday: \"The figures do raise questions for forces to answer and show the importance of spreading best practice,\" he said. \"This is not about naming and shaming. It's about highlighting areas where particular focus has to be put.\" But the Police Superintendents' Association of England and Wales warned against close comparisons. President chief superintendent Peter Gammon said: \"As with all league tables, their value is not in the raw statistics but in the discussion they generate.\" The cause of crime Home office criminologists published projections towards the end of last year that suggested Britain was on the brink of a sharp rise in crime partly owing to increased personal wealth. Most offences are committed by men aged under 24 and the 1980s baby boom also contributed to officials' warnings of forthcoming problems.

Ce dernier d\u00e9veloppement suscite une v\u00e9ritable agitation dans le monde de l'enseignement et dans les familles. Rassur\u00e9s, r\u00e9ticents ou carr\u00e9ment oppos\u00e9s, les avis sont tranch\u00e9s.</p> <p>J'ai parl\u00e9 avec Martine Nawrat du Mouvement fran\u00e7ais pour le planning familial, Philippe, p\u00e8re de famille et Isabelle, \u00e9tudiante \u00e2g\u00e9e de 13 ans.</p> <p><strong>Que penses-tu de cette mesure ?</strong></p> <p><strong>Martine:</strong> C'est un excellent projet. On s'est battus pour que la pilule du lendemain soit distribu\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole. Maintenant on veut que les infirmi\u00e8res soient form\u00e9es pour la donner, qu'elles ne soient pas juste des distributeurs de pilules. Ce qu'il faut, c'est que les filles soient accompagn\u00e9es. Si on prend cette pilule, c'est qu'on a pris un risque - il faut savoir pourquoi on a pris ce risque et comment on peut se prot\u00e9ger.</p> <p><strong>Philippe:</strong> C'est une mauvaise r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une vraie question ; \u00e7a ne participe pas \u00e0 une responsabilisation des adolescents. Il y a une vraie question sur l'avortement chez les jeunes mais je ne pense pas que \u00e7a soit \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat de d\u00e9cider pour les individus. C'est une affaire priv\u00e9e.</p> <p><strong>Isabelle :</strong> C'est bien pour les personnes qui ont des relations sexuelles et qui ont oubli\u00e9 leur pilule habituelle. Elles auraient peut-\u00eatre pas le courage d'aller \u00e0 la pharmacie. Maintenant, elles pourront aller \u00e0 l'infirmerie de l'\u00e9cole.</p> <p><strong>Y a-t-il une raison d'\u00eatre contre ?</strong></p> <p><strong>Martine:</strong> Les gens qui sont contre cette pilule \u00e9taient \u00e9galement contre les distributeurs de pr\u00e9servatifs dans les lyc\u00e9es. C'est toujours les m\u00eames arguments. Je pense qu'il vaut mieux apporter l'information l\u00e0 o\u00f9 il y a des jeunes. Si les jeunes doivent se d\u00e9placer pour chercher des pr\u00e9servatifs ou la pilule du lendemain, il vont se dire \"c'est peut-\u00eatre pas la peine\" tandis que les avoir sur leur lieu de vie, c'est un pas \u00e9norme.</p> <p><strong>Philippe:</strong> \u00c7a serait mieux de promouvoir le port de la capote. Si vous voulez assumer votre vie sexuelle, soyez responsable : mettez des pr\u00e9servatifs. J'ai l'impression qu'avec ce projet, on sabote toutes les campagnes qui encouragent les jeunes \u00e0 porter des capotes.</p> <p><strong>Isabelle :</strong> La pilule \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole, \u00e7a ne va pas remplacer le pr\u00e9servatif, qui est plut\u00f4t contre le sida. On sera obligatoirement oblig\u00e9 de l'utiliser. En plus, il para\u00eet que la pilule du lendemain n'est pas s\u00fbre \u00e0 100 %.</p> <p><strong>Est-ce que les adolescentes qui prennent la pilule du lendemain ont besoin d'un soutien psychologique ?</strong></p> <p><strong>Martine:</strong> Il faut former les infirmi\u00e8res pour qu'elles \u00e9coutent ce que les filles disent et pour pouvoir donner un max d'informations. Mais ce n'est pas juste donner une info, c'est d\u00e9j\u00e0 voir un peu o\u00f9 elles en sont par rapport \u00e0 la connaissance de leur corps et par rapport \u00e0 la contraception en g\u00e9neral.</p> <p><strong>Philippe:</strong> Il faudrait leur dire qu'elles feraient mieux de prendre la pilule la veille plut\u00f4t que le lendemain ! Je me demande si les infirmi\u00e8res d'\u00e9coles sont vraiment adapt\u00e9es \u00e0 aider les jeunes filles ? Par contre, c'est vrai que c'est beaucoup plus simple de parler \u00e0 quelqu'un qu'on ne conna\u00eet pas qu'avec ses parents.</p> <p><strong>Isabelle :</strong> \u00c7a d\u00e9pend des gens. Je pense qu'il y en a qui en ont besoin, mais \u00e7a d\u00e9pend des personnalit\u00e9s. Moi, je ne demanderais pas de conseils \u00e0 une infirmi\u00e8re \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole.</p> <p><strong>Que penses-tu de l'\u00e9ducation sexuelle \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole ?</strong></p> <p><strong>Martine:</strong> Le plus t\u00f4t on est inform\u00e9, mieux \u00e7a sera pour se pr\u00e9parer dans sa vie sexuelle. On n'est pas oblig\u00e9 d'attendre que les adolescents aient d\u00e9j\u00e0 une vie sexuelle - des fois, \u00e7a peut \u00eatre trop tard. Si on est d\u00e9j\u00e0 inform\u00e9, \u00e7a permet de commencer sa vie sexuelle sans risque.</p> <p><strong>Philippe:</strong> Il faut dire aux enfants que s'ils veulent avoir une vie sexuelle active, il faut mettre des capotes. La pilule du lendemain, \u00e7a veut dire quoi ? - c'est un avortement quand m\u00eame. En plus, les filles qui vont aller voir l'infirmi\u00e8re ne savent m\u00eame pas si elles sont enceintes.</p> <p><strong>Isabelle :</strong> On fera l'\u00e9ducation sexuelle plus tard dans l'ann\u00e9e. Mais on n'en a encore jamais fait, \u00e7a sera la premi\u00e8re fois. C'est bien parce que je pense qu'il y a aussi des relations sexuelles \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole.</p> <p><strong>Glossaire/Glossary</strong></p> <p><strong>une capote </strong>(colloq.) condom <br><strong>\u00eatre enceinte </strong>to be pregnant <br><strong>\u00eatre inquiet </strong>to be worried <br><strong>une infirmi\u00e8re </strong>nurse <br><strong>un max </strong>(colloq.) maximum <br><strong>la pilule du lendemain </strong> morning-after pill <br><strong>un pr\u00e9servatif </strong>condom <br><strong>saboter </strong>sabotage <br><strong>le sida </strong>Aids <br><strong>un soutien psychologique </strong>counselling, support <br><strong>la veille </strong>the day before <br><strong>en vente libre</strong> on sale over the counter, freely available</p>",

Ce dernier d\u00e9veloppement suscite une v\u00e9ritable agitation dans le monde de l'enseignement et dans les familles. Rassur\u00e9s, r\u00e9ticents ou carr\u00e9ment oppos\u00e9s, les avis sont tranch\u00e9s. J'ai parl\u00e9 avec Martine Nawrat du Mouvement fran\u00e7ais pour le planning familial, Philippe, p\u00e8re de famille et Isabelle, \u00e9tudiante \u00e2g\u00e9e de 13 ans. Que penses-tu de cette mesure ? Martine: C'est un excellent projet. On s'est battus pour que la pilule du lendemain soit distribu\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole. Maintenant on veut que les infirmi\u00e8res soient form\u00e9es pour la donner, qu'elles ne soient pas juste des distributeurs de pilules. Ce qu'il faut, c'est que les filles soient accompagn\u00e9es. Si on prend cette pilule, c'est qu'on a pris un risque - il faut savoir pourquoi on a pris ce risque et comment on peut se prot\u00e9ger. Philippe: C'est une mauvaise r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une vraie question ; \u00e7a ne participe pas \u00e0 une responsabilisation des adolescents. Il y a une vraie question sur l'avortement chez les jeunes mais je ne pense pas que \u00e7a soit \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat de d\u00e9cider pour les individus. C'est une affaire priv\u00e9e. Isabelle : C'est bien pour les personnes qui ont des relations sexuelles et qui ont oubli\u00e9 leur pilule habituelle. Elles auraient peut-\u00eatre pas le courage d'aller \u00e0 la pharmacie. Maintenant, elles pourront aller \u00e0 l'infirmerie de l'\u00e9cole. Y a-t-il une raison d'\u00eatre contre ? Martine: Les gens qui sont contre cette pilule \u00e9taient \u00e9galement contre les distributeurs de pr\u00e9servatifs dans les lyc\u00e9es. C'est toujours les m\u00eames arguments. Je pense qu'il vaut mieux apporter l'information l\u00e0 o\u00f9 il y a des jeunes. Si les jeunes doivent se d\u00e9placer pour chercher des pr\u00e9servatifs ou la pilule du lendemain, il vont se dire \"c'est peut-\u00eatre pas la peine\" tandis que les avoir sur leur lieu de vie, c'est un pas \u00e9norme. Philippe: \u00c7a serait mieux de promouvoir le port de la capote. Si vous voulez assumer votre vie sexuelle, soyez responsable : mettez des pr\u00e9servatifs. J'ai l'impression qu'avec ce projet, on sabote toutes les campagnes qui encouragent les jeunes \u00e0 porter des capotes. Isabelle : La pilule \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole, \u00e7a ne va pas remplacer le pr\u00e9servatif, qui est plut\u00f4t contre le sida. On sera obligatoirement oblig\u00e9 de l'utiliser. En plus, il para\u00eet que la pilule du lendemain n'est pas s\u00fbre \u00e0 100 %. Est-ce que les adolescentes qui prennent la pilule du lendemain ont besoin d'un soutien psychologique ? Martine: Il faut former les infirmi\u00e8res pour qu'elles \u00e9coutent ce que les filles disent et pour pouvoir donner un max d'informations. Mais ce n'est pas juste donner une info, c'est d\u00e9j\u00e0 voir un peu o\u00f9 elles en sont par rapport \u00e0 la connaissance de leur corps et par rapport \u00e0 la contraception en g\u00e9neral. Philippe: Il faudrait leur dire qu'elles feraient mieux de prendre la pilule la veille plut\u00f4t que le lendemain ! Je me demande si les infirmi\u00e8res d'\u00e9coles sont vraiment adapt\u00e9es \u00e0 aider les jeunes filles ? Par contre, c'est vrai que c'est beaucoup plus simple de parler \u00e0 quelqu'un qu'on ne conna\u00eet pas qu'avec ses parents. Isabelle : \u00c7a d\u00e9pend des gens. Je pense qu'il y en a qui en ont besoin, mais \u00e7a d\u00e9pend des personnalit\u00e9s. Moi, je ne demanderais pas de conseils \u00e0 une infirmi\u00e8re \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole. Que penses-tu de l'\u00e9ducation sexuelle \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole ? Martine: Le plus t\u00f4t on est inform\u00e9, mieux \u00e7a sera pour se pr\u00e9parer dans sa vie sexuelle. On n'est pas oblig\u00e9 d'attendre que les adolescents aient d\u00e9j\u00e0 une vie sexuelle - des fois, \u00e7a peut \u00eatre trop tard. Si on est d\u00e9j\u00e0 inform\u00e9, \u00e7a permet de commencer sa vie sexuelle sans risque. Philippe: Il faut dire aux enfants que s'ils veulent avoir une vie sexuelle active, il faut mettre des capotes. La pilule du lendemain, \u00e7a veut dire quoi ? - c'est un avortement quand m\u00eame. En plus, les filles qui vont aller voir l'infirmi\u00e8re ne savent m\u00eame pas si elles sont enceintes. Isabelle : On fera l'\u00e9ducation sexuelle plus tard dans l'ann\u00e9e. Mais on n'en a encore jamais fait, \u00e7a sera la premi\u00e8re fois. C'est bien parce que je pense qu'il y a aussi des relations sexuelles \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole.

The jury remains out on the precise reasons why, with price deflation and the internet the top two suspects. With regard to the latter, Clinton has already launched its own website and is \"currently developing, in collaboration with one of our suppliers, an e-commerce operation which will be ready during 2000\".

Journalists just creep in at the bottom ahead of that other notorious profession - the estate agent. </p> <p>But if the poll shows that the public's view of pay in health and education is more complex than might have been assumed, its results contain a stark warning for the government on the national minimum wage. </p> <p>An overwhelming 85% believe that the government should not, as planned, freeze the minimum wage at \u00a33.60 an hour until its impact on jobs becomes clear, but should increase it in line with inflation. Only 13% believe it should remain frozen at \u00a33.60 an hour. </p> <p>The survey also shows that a clear majority is willing to pay extra tax to fund increases to close the pay gap between the public and private sector for nurses and teachers. </p> <p>A third of voters say they are unwilling to do this. Nearly 40% of Tory voters say they are unwilling to pay extra tax to fund such pay increases. There is also strong but not majority support for such rises to be tied to performance related pay. </p> <p>ICM Research interviewed a random selection of 860 adults aged over 18 by telephone between January 14 and 16 2000.

      "bodyText": "One root cause of the recruitment crisis in the public sector, including in Britain's hospitals and classrooms, may lie in the fact that the public massively underestimates the amount that nurses, teachers and other key staff are paid, according to the latest Guardian/ICM opinion poll. The survey on public sector pay shows that people believe nurses earn \u00a33,000 a year less than they are actually paid, but they think they deserve to get a pay increase which would take their average salary up to \u00a323,000 a year - more than the pay award announced yesterday. The gap between what the public thinks nurses are paid and what they actually receive may account for some of the recruiting problems experienced by the NHS and other parts of the public sector, such as the police. The poll shows that the public believes that teachers, hospital porters, ambulance staff, doctors and police officers should all get substantial pay increases. But in many cases, including those of the police and teachers, the public consistently underestimates how much such public servants are paid and how much they ought to earn. For example, a primary school teacher is generally believed to earn \u00a318,700 a year, the survey shows, and the public thinks they should be paid \u00a33,300 more to take them up to \u00a322,000. Unfortunately for primary school teachers, and the pay campaigns waged by the teaching unions, this figure is \u00a3500 below what the average primary school teacher is currently paid. The survey also shows that while some sections of the public sector are underpaid, adult voters believe that senior civil servants, MPs and cabinet ministers are overpaid. This is underlined by the findings of the question asking voters to rank various occupations on a scale of one to 10 in terms of how much they are respected. Nurses, doctors and, perhaps surprisingly, schoolteachers come out as the top three, with university lecturers and police officers also commanding a high respect rating. Civil servants and politicians find themselves halfway down the league table. But their occupations are still ranked significantly above those of soap stars and footballers. Journalists just creep in at the bottom ahead of that other notorious profession - the estate agent. But if the poll shows that the public's view of pay in health and education is more complex than might have been assumed, its results contain a stark warning for the government on the national minimum wage. An overwhelming 85% believe that the government should not, as planned, freeze the minimum wage at \u00a33.60 an hour until its impact on jobs becomes clear, but should increase it in line with inflation. Only 13% believe it should remain frozen at \u00a33.60 an hour. The survey also shows that a clear majority is willing to pay extra tax to fund increases to close the pay gap between the public and private sector for nurses and teachers. A third of voters say they are unwilling to do this. Nearly 40% of Tory voters say they are unwilling to pay extra tax to fund such pay increases. There is also strong but not majority support for such rises to be tied to performance related pay. ICM Research interviewed a random selection of 860 adults aged over 18 by telephone between January 14 and 16 2000. Interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>What does London look like? Like the film Notting Hill - verdant bowers in private squares and next to no black people? Like Sliding Doors - sunny porticos, chic restaurants, Gwyneth Paltrow's English simper? Or like Nil by Mouth, a brutalist Peckham never imagined even in Del Boy Trotter's philosophy? </p> <p>In his new film Wonderland, Michael Winterbottom has tried to depict another London. This is not some touristic confection, nor an unremitting hell hole - it's a London that you may actually recognise in all its splendid grubbiness and tatty grandiosity. </p> <p>At the start, for instance, Gina McKee does a runner from a blind date in the Pitcher and Piano bar in Dean Street. And who can blame her? She towered over this ageing troll of a man as they shouted awkward pleasantries at each other in the beery crush. It was never going to work, not even for one night. You watch her walk, vulnerable, hunched and with a daft hairdo, through Soho. </p> <p>And then three things happen. First, you become conscious of the press of people, the yellow London brick, the neon. The colours drizzle and glisten wetly, like they do when Scorsese films New York at night, although here the density of the crowds and the buildings, as well as the grainy film stock that Winterbottom uses, give this scene a cherishable London specificity. </p> <p>Then Michael Nyman's sumptuous, romantic soundtrack starts up, full of emotional import that you can't quite yet account for, but that nonetheless helps lift this quotidian scene out of glum English realism. </p> <p>Then, thirdly, the film speeds up. In this stop-frame section, the colours blur and McKee is transported through the streets as though she's got a jet pack in her duffel bag. Winterbottom says that he was influenced in these scenes by Wong Kar-Wai's Chungking Express, and here he has created a visual parallel to Kar-Wai's seedily beautiful neon-and-noodles Hong Kong. Yet at the same time he shows what London looks like to his characters: a rush of poignant colours and noise, a floating world that signifies all too much. </p> <p>Winterbottom takes a pull on his beer. We're sitting in a London touristic confection, a poncy hotel bar opposite the BBC. Around us men in black ties and kilts, and women in ball gowns mill in preparation for some Scottish corporate nightmare of an evening. In Wonderland, Winterbottom sullied this same hotel by setting a scene in an upstairs room. There, a couple from Manchester have a weekend birthday shagfest under the doubtless encouraging gazes of Eric Gill's reliefs on Broadcasting House opposite. </p> <p>Winterbottom explains what he was aiming for with Wonderland. \"I was trying to bring out a London that I felt I hadn't seen on film before. London is a restless place and people have to struggle to keep their heads above water. I wanted to show that. I think the basic issues are the same wherever you live, but you're going to be more conscious in a city of 7m of how many people you see during the day who you don't know. The techniques came out of what we were trying to do with the film.\" London was captured by v\u00e9rit\u00e9, documentary-style techniques: a tiny crew working with a hand-held camera, natural lighting, no boom microphones, no clapperboard, real locations. </p> <p>\"We put the characters among real people in London to be more true to the place. What normally happens in a film is that you'll shoot an 11pm pub scene at 11am in the morning. The pub will be empty and you'll fill it with extras saying 'rhubarb' to each other. And then you'll edit out all the 'rhubarbs' and put over talking tracks, which feel false. Instead, we decided to film the scene in the pub at 11pm when it's full of people who are drunk and are preparing to go home.\" </p> <p>Wonderland is set over a Bonfire Night weekend and mostly concerns the struggles of three sisters to make human connections in a dislocating city. But Winterbottom denies that the drama is at all Chekhovian: \"Initially the script was like Short Cuts [Robert Altman's LA-set film] and the connections between the stories were purely down to geography. But as we talked about it we came round to the idea that actually they should be three sisters, with a family built around them. The story of one sister tells you something about the other two.\" </p> <p>The problem with the film stems from the inability of Laurence Coriat's script to create convincing characters. Typical is Gina McKee's waitress Nadia, who can only find dates through lonely hearts columns and is prey to every oaf she thus encounters. But how did Nadia get this way? We are given no insight into her struggles or her grinning social ineptitude. And in the cast of sad and incompetent humans who populate Wonderland, we are never really encouraged to understand why these people are unable to master their fates. As a result, the film often becomes alienating and infuriating. </p> <p>Worse, Coriat's script presumes to represent London as it is. And Winterbottom is in league with this presumptuousness. Near the end, the camera pulls back from a tower-block flat to reveal a dense wall of similar flats. It withdraws further to disclose a cityscape of tower blocks and St Paul's shimmering in the night. This, the syntax of this sequence suggests, is what London is like: hopeless people striving ineptly in bite-sized flats. And yet it's a lie, just like the tacked-on happy ending that follows. </p> <p>A few scenes nonetheless ring true. When Nadia returns home after a jaw-dropping piece of post-coital cruelty, she sits on the top deck of the 171 bus from Aldwych to the Elephant. Down the front a group of drunk friends are laughing loudly and photographing each other, forcing their good time on her. It's Saturday night and the condensation she wipes from the window is made up of her fellow travellers' beer breath and bonhomie. Through the window, it's the fag end of the night, and nothing's ever going to be right. The scene goes on for ages, but I didn't mind. Who hasn't had that experience of being out of joint with happiness? </p> <p>There aren't a lot of laughs in Wonderland. But then, it would be hard to imagine a Michael Winterbottom comedy. Since his feature film debut in 1995, his Winterbottomland has been a grim place, perhaps as you'd expect from one who cut his teeth on a documentary about Ingmar Bergman. </p> <p>First there was Butterfly Kiss (1995), a serial killer road movie set in north England starring Amanda Plummer and Saskia Reeves; then Jude (1996), a properly grim adaptation of Hardy's novel with Christopher Eccleston and Kate Winslet; next Welcome to Sarajevo (1997), a film substantially based on ITN reporter Michael Nicholson's adoption of a Bosnian child, starring Stephen Dillane and Woody Harrelson; then I Want You (1998) with Rachel Weisz in and out of love in Hastings - hardly a laugh riot. </p> <p>His next project, the western Kingdom Come, which he starts shooting in a purpose-built town in the Canadian Rockies in three weeks' time, will star Nastassja Kinski, Peter Mullan, Milla Jovovich and Wes Bentley (soon to be seen and admired as a voyeuristic teen in American Beauty). It will be a story set in a gold rush town - typically, after the gold rush. </p> <p>Whatever Wonderland's shortcomings, Winterbottom does elicit some terrific performances, not just from McKee or Ian Hart (himself a wonderland of Scouse dysfunction). Both Jack Shepherd's weak husband and Kika Markham's embittered wife are desperately affecting. None of the leading actors is from London, though, and it grates to hear rough stabs at estuary English being made by Canadians, Scots and northerners. Though, to be fair, not as much as when Paltrow opened her gob in Sliding Doors. </p> <p>Wonderland has a sour vision of the world. Even the title is clunkingly ironic: baby Alice is born to one of the sisters during the weekend, into a city that seems anything but a wonderland. Winterbottom, 38, suggests that London becomes progressively unliveable as you get older: \"The new-born baby has all these endless possibilities. You even worry for the 11-year-old son, Jack, because his opportunities seem fewer,\" he says. \"As people get older you have that gradual reduction of where you can go. I suppose you could say that the older the people get the less happy they are.\" </p> <p>On the continent Winterbottom's work is regarded with a seriousness he despairs of ever finding here. At Cannes and Berlin the films of this Blackburn-raised, Oxford-educated auteur have been properly appreciated. \"In Europe, generally people are more interested that cinema should be judged in a respect other than box office returns,\" he says bitterly. \"Here people are more paranoid about box office: critics are more concerned about being seen to have an understanding of popular taste, rather than being a voice in the wilderness saying this is what you should watch.\" </p> <p>And perhaps, despite its many failings, we should watch Wonderland. There are some lovely human cinematic moments. When Jack goes to a firework display, there is a very upsetting scene. In the darkness we can just make out that something covert and cruel is happening: a little boy is getting mugged for his Walkman and rucksack by big vague adults. It's in the affecting shock of such scenes, when cinema is allied to everyday, eternal human suffering and not exploited to serve some bogus end, that Winterbottom gets beyond the inept conceits betrayed by the film's title. </p> <p>\u0095 Wonderland is on general release.</p>",

She towered over this ageing troll of a man as they shouted awkward pleasantries at each other in the beery crush. It was never going to work, not even for one night. You watch her walk, vulnerable, hunched and with a daft hairdo, through Soho. And then three things happen. First, you become conscious of the press of people, the yellow London brick, the neon. The colours drizzle and glisten wetly, like they do when Scorsese films New York at night, although here the density of the crowds and the buildings, as well as the grainy film stock that Winterbottom uses, give this scene a cherishable London specificity. Then Michael Nyman's sumptuous, romantic soundtrack starts up, full of emotional import that you can't quite yet account for, but that nonetheless helps lift this quotidian scene out of glum English realism. Then, thirdly, the film speeds up. In this stop-frame section, the colours blur and McKee is transported through the streets as though she's got a jet pack in her duffel bag. Winterbottom says that he was influenced in these scenes by Wong Kar-Wai's Chungking Express, and here he has created a visual parallel to Kar-Wai's seedily beautiful neon-and-noodles Hong Kong. Yet at the same time he shows what London looks like to his characters: a rush of poignant colours and noise, a floating world that signifies all too much. Winterbottom takes a pull on his beer. We're sitting in a London touristic confection, a poncy hotel bar opposite the BBC. Around us men in black ties and kilts, and women in ball gowns mill in preparation for some Scottish corporate nightmare of an evening. In Wonderland, Winterbottom sullied this same hotel by setting a scene in an upstairs room. There, a couple from Manchester have a weekend birthday shagfest under the doubtless encouraging gazes of Eric Gill's reliefs on Broadcasting House opposite. Winterbottom explains what he was aiming for with Wonderland. \"I was trying to bring out a London that I felt I hadn't seen on film before. London is a restless place and people have to struggle to keep their heads above water. I wanted to show that. I think the basic issues are the same wherever you live, but you're going to be more conscious in a city of 7m of how many people you see during the day who you don't know. The techniques came out of what we were trying to do with the film.\" London was captured by v\u00e9rit\u00e9, documentary-style techniques: a tiny crew working with a hand-held camera, natural lighting, no boom microphones, no clapperboard, real locations. \"We put the characters among real people in London to be more true to the place. What normally happens in a film is that you'll shoot an 11pm pub scene at 11am in the morning. The pub will be empty and you'll fill it with extras saying 'rhubarb' to each other. And then you'll edit out all the 'rhubarbs' and put over talking tracks, which feel false. Instead, we decided to film the scene in the pub at 11pm when it's full of people who are drunk and are preparing to go home.\" Wonderland is set over a Bonfire Night weekend and mostly concerns the struggles of three sisters to make human connections in a dislocating city. But Winterbottom denies that the drama is at all Chekhovian: \"Initially the script was like Short Cuts [Robert Altman's LA-set film] and the connections between the stories were purely down to geography. But as we talked about it we came round to the idea that actually they should be three sisters, with a family built around them. The story of one sister tells you something about the other two.\" The problem with the film stems from the inability of Laurence Coriat's script to create convincing characters. Typical is Gina McKee's waitress Nadia, who can only find dates through lonely hearts columns and is prey to every oaf she thus encounters. But how did Nadia get this way? We are given no insight into her struggles or her grinning social ineptitude. And in the cast of sad and incompetent humans who populate Wonderland, we are never really encouraged to understand why these people are unable to master their fates. As a result, the film often becomes alienating and infuriating. Worse, Coriat's script presumes to represent London as it is. And Winterbottom is in league with this presumptuousness. Near the end, the camera pulls back from a tower-block flat to reveal a dense wall of similar flats. It withdraws further to disclose a cityscape of tower blocks and St Paul's shimmering in the night. This, the syntax of this sequence suggests, is what London is like: hopeless people striving ineptly in bite-sized flats. And yet it's a lie, just like the tacked-on happy ending that follows. A few scenes nonetheless ring true. When Nadia returns home after a jaw-dropping piece of post-coital cruelty, she sits on the top deck of the 171 bus from Aldwych to the Elephant. Down the front a group of drunk friends are laughing loudly and photographing each other, forcing their good time on her. It's Saturday night and the condensation she wipes from the window is made up of her fellow travellers' beer breath and bonhomie. Through the window, it's the fag end of the night, and nothing's ever going to be right. The scene goes on for ages, but I didn't mind. Who hasn't had that experience of being out of joint with happiness? There aren't a lot of laughs in Wonderland. But then, it would be hard to imagine a Michael Winterbottom comedy. Since his feature film debut in 1995, his Winterbottomland has been a grim place, perhaps as you'd expect from one who cut his teeth on a documentary about Ingmar Bergman. First there was Butterfly Kiss (1995), a serial killer road movie set in north England starring Amanda Plummer and Saskia Reeves; then Jude (1996), a properly grim adaptation of Hardy's novel with Christopher Eccleston and Kate Winslet; next Welcome to Sarajevo (1997), a film substantially based on ITN reporter Michael Nicholson's adoption of a Bosnian child, starring Stephen Dillane and Woody Harrelson; then I Want You (1998) with Rachel Weisz in and out of love in Hastings - hardly a laugh riot. His next project, the western Kingdom Come, which he starts shooting in a purpose-built town in the Canadian Rockies in three weeks' time, will star Nastassja Kinski, Peter Mullan, Milla Jovovich and Wes Bentley (soon to be seen and admired as a voyeuristic teen in American Beauty). It will be a story set in a gold rush town - typically, after the gold rush. Whatever Wonderland's shortcomings, Winterbottom does elicit some terrific performances, not just from McKee or Ian Hart (himself a wonderland of Scouse dysfunction). Both Jack Shepherd's weak husband and Kika Markham's embittered wife are desperately affecting. None of the leading actors is from London, though, and it grates to hear rough stabs at estuary English being made by Canadians, Scots and northerners. Though, to be fair, not as much as when Paltrow opened her gob in Sliding Doors. Wonderland has a sour vision of the world. Even the title is clunkingly ironic: baby Alice is born to one of the sisters during the weekend, into a city that seems anything but a wonderland. Winterbottom, 38, suggests that London becomes progressively unliveable as you get older: \"The new-born baby has all these endless possibilities. You even worry for the 11-year-old son, Jack, because his opportunities seem fewer,\" he says. \"As people get older you have that gradual reduction of where you can go. I suppose you could say that the older the people get the less happy they are.\" On the continent Winterbottom's work is regarded with a seriousness he despairs of ever finding here. At Cannes and Berlin the films of this Blackburn-raised, Oxford-educated auteur have been properly appreciated. \"In Europe, generally people are more interested that cinema should be judged in a respect other than box office returns,\" he says bitterly. \"Here people are more paranoid about box office: critics are more concerned about being seen to have an understanding of popular taste, rather than being a voice in the wilderness saying this is what you should watch.\" And perhaps, despite its many failings, we should watch Wonderland. There are some lovely human cinematic moments. When Jack goes to a firework display, there is a very upsetting scene. In the darkness we can just make out that something covert and cruel is happening: a little boy is getting mugged for his Walkman and rucksack by big vague adults. It's in the affecting shock of such scenes, when cinema is allied to everyday, eternal human suffering and not exploited to serve some bogus end, that Winterbottom gets beyond the inept conceits betrayed by the film's title. \u0095 Wonderland is on general release.",

Rejecting an application for judicial review of the home secretary's decision to allow Tyson into the country, Mr Justice Sullivan said the court had to take into account the \"potential adverse circumstances for many entirely innocent third parties\". The Justice for Women group was seeking a review of Jack Straw's ruling, claiming that he had acted outside the immigration rules by giving Tyson permission to enter the country because of exceptional circumstances. The group also claimed that by admitting the convicted rapist the government was sending out a message that was inconsistent with its policy on combating sexual violence against women.

The former world champion is due to fight Julius Francis at the end of this month but the bout was thrown into doubt by immigration rules stating that Tyson should not be allowed into the country because of his 1992 conviction for rape. Justice for Women claimed that Mr Straw had based his decision on commercial, not compassionate, grounds. The judge ruled that, like Mr Straw, he was concerned that small businesses in Manchester could be bankrupted if Tyson's bout against Francis were to be cancelled.

      "body": "<p>It's odd we don't see more of the internet on TV, when it fulfils so many channels' programme-making criteria: it's cheap, it's zeitgeisty - and did I mention how cheap it is? But, sooner or later, every TV show about the internet hits the same problem - after a while, it has to display the show's raison d' \u00eatre, the web pages themselves. And, to paraphrase the old Kit-Kat slogan, they can't dance, they can't sing, and they look awful. </p> <p>For some reason, even the most exhaustively overdesigned website, when displayed on TV, magically transforms itself into a bunch of brightly coloured boxes with little bits of writing on them. As a bonus, they're often little bits of writing that are way too small to read, probably due to the fact that people usually sit a couple of metres away from their TV (to ward off the childhood-ingrained hazard of \"making your eyes go funny\"), instead of within arm's length of their computer screen (all the better to wipe the spittle off it, many office workers find). </p> <p>Consequently, the basic \"here are some web pages\" TV format has been forced to take on some pioneering new forms. Sky 1 has a three-hour Saturday-night slot (admittedly, incorporating episodes of The Simpsons, Futurama and The PJs) called Sky Rocket, outwardly old-fashioned in its sci-fi setting and chirpy presenters with 'borg-like \"devices\" clamped to their faces. But, innovatively, something about the way it's filmed means that it does indeed resemble something you've downloaded off the net, while the presenters interrupt each other with a casual ferocity rarely seen outside online chatrooms. </p> <p>Some of the content, too, provides a scathing riposte to those who accuse prime-time TV of \"dumbing down\" - last Saturday, at 7.51pm, while BBC1 was revelling in The National Lottery and ITV was in the final throes of Blind Date, the Sky Rocket \"build your own web page\" feature was wooing ratings with a brief introduction to hexadecimal RGB triplets and hypertext markup language. </p> <p>But, ultimately, it still relies on that old mainstay of showing viewers websites and their hilariously unwieldy addresses. Thank Gutenberg, you find yourself thinking, that the printing press was invented before television, otherwise there'd be shows where people hold pages of their favourite magazines up against the camera, while page numbers appear fleetingly on the screen for anyone who feels the need to go look up the article themselves. </p> <p>Carlton World's Net.Comedy (9.30pm, Thursdays) takes a different tack - recognising that web pages themselves don't make especially gripping viewing, they're used as starting points for stand-up comedy routines. Perhaps disappointingly, the gags aren't typically based around the web-surfing experience - \"Don'tcha just hate it, ladies and gentlemen, when you're trying to stream Real Audio from behind a corporate firewall?\" </p> <p>Still, by using websites the same way that Have I Got News For You uses headlines and news stories, it's a promising sign that viewers can accept the net as a recognisably banal part of their lives. Of course, the true masters of this are the ever-topical writers of Neighbours who, in their usual wholesale pilfering of the human condition, have recently conjured up email romances, someone posting a picture of their flatmate on a web page (whereupon it gets stuck on the body of a glamour model) or, as happened only last week, Harold Bishop discovering printouts of net anarchist propaganda while going through someone else's bins. </p> <p>Sadly, this attitude hasn't permeated very far at the BBC, which traditionally balances its \"Computers Don't Bite\" or \"Webwise\" educational campaigns with more cautionary fare, invariably following them with computers-gone-mad films like Westworld, The Demon Seed, or Terminator 2. But once websites come to be regarded as just another part of the media landscape, this opens up opportunities for Hello-style \"masthead\" programming. Admittedly, definitive online muck-raker Matt Drudge (of The Drudge Report) recently parted company with his Fox Network TV show, but Channel 4's new late-night conspiracy fest, Disinfo Nation, is the UK's first to be based on an original website - specifically, host Richard Metzger's disinfo.com. </p> <p>And by using his site as a template, Metzger, perhaps unintentionally, has captured one of the vital differences between TV and the net. TV shows are filled with what the producers think the audience wants (or ought) to see, but the best web pages are filled with what the webmaster happens to find interesting - in this case, a subcultural freakshow of fringe artists and other assorted wackos. At the same time, by tracking them down and interviewing them in their natural habitats, the show delivers a far more TV-friendly experience than simply showing you pictures of their web pages which, if you think about it, is really just swapping one kind of TV screen for another.</p>",

As a bonus, they're often little bits of writing that are way too small to read, probably due to the fact that people usually sit a couple of metres away from their TV (to ward off the childhood-ingrained hazard of \"making your eyes go funny\"), instead of within arm's length of their computer screen (all the better to wipe the spittle off it, many office workers find). Consequently, the basic \"here are some web pages\" TV format has been forced to take on some pioneering new forms. Sky 1 has a three-hour Saturday-night slot (admittedly, incorporating episodes of The Simpsons, Futurama and The PJs) called Sky Rocket, outwardly old-fashioned in its sci-fi setting and chirpy presenters with 'borg-like \"devices\" clamped to their faces. But, innovatively, something about the way it's filmed means that it does indeed resemble something you've downloaded off the net, while the presenters interrupt each other with a casual ferocity rarely seen outside online chatrooms. Some of the content, too, provides a scathing riposte to those who accuse prime-time TV of \"dumbing down\" - last Saturday, at 7.51pm, while BBC1 was revelling in The National Lottery and ITV was in the final throes of Blind Date, the Sky Rocket \"build your own web page\" feature was wooing ratings with a brief introduction to hexadecimal RGB triplets and hypertext markup language. But, ultimately, it still relies on that old mainstay of showing viewers websites and their hilariously unwieldy addresses. Thank Gutenberg, you find yourself thinking, that the printing press was invented before television, otherwise there'd be shows where people hold pages of their favourite magazines up against the camera, while page numbers appear fleetingly on the screen for anyone who feels the need to go look up the article themselves. Carlton World's Net.Comedy (9.30pm, Thursdays) takes a different tack - recognising that web pages themselves don't make especially gripping viewing, they're used as starting points for stand-up comedy routines. Perhaps disappointingly, the gags aren't typically based around the web-surfing experience - \"Don'tcha just hate it, ladies and gentlemen, when you're trying to stream Real Audio from behind a corporate firewall?\" Still, by using websites the same way that Have I Got News For You uses headlines and news stories, it's a promising sign that viewers can accept the net as a recognisably banal part of their lives. Of course, the true masters of this are the ever-topical writers of Neighbours who, in their usual wholesale pilfering of the human condition, have recently conjured up email romances, someone posting a picture of their flatmate on a web page (whereupon it gets stuck on the body of a glamour model) or, as happened only last week, Harold Bishop discovering printouts of net anarchist propaganda while going through someone else's bins. Sadly, this attitude hasn't permeated very far at the BBC, which traditionally balances its \"Computers Don't Bite\" or \"Webwise\" educational campaigns with more cautionary fare, invariably following them with computers-gone-mad films like Westworld, The Demon Seed, or Terminator 2. But once websites come to be regarded as just another part of the media landscape, this opens up opportunities for Hello-style \"masthead\" programming. Admittedly, definitive online muck-raker Matt Drudge (of The Drudge Report) recently parted company with his Fox Network TV show, but Channel 4's new late-night conspiracy fest, Disinfo Nation, is the UK's first to be based on an original website - specifically, host Richard Metzger's disinfo.com. And by using his site as a template, Metzger, perhaps unintentionally, has captured one of the vital differences between TV and the net. TV shows are filled with what the producers think the audience wants (or ought) to see, but the best web pages are filled with what the webmaster happens to find interesting - in this case, a subcultural freakshow of fringe artists and other assorted wackos. At the same time, by tracking them down and interviewing them in their natural habitats, the show delivers a far more TV-friendly experience than simply showing you pictures of their web pages which, if you think about it, is really just swapping one kind of TV screen for another.",

The chairman of Rover Group, Prof W Samann, told reporters recently that full membership of the euro would \"consolidate BMW's investment\" in Britain. </p> <p>Naoyuki Akikusa, the president of Fujitsu, went further last year. \"If the UK were to join in 2002, that would be OK. But if 2020 - that would pose a big problem.\" </p> <p>Toyota managers said yesterday that its UK operations, including a new \u00a3200m plant at Burnaston, Derbyshire, would be at risk if the strong pound continued to push its British operations deep into the red. The company said its British operation had suffered its worst performance ever last year as a result of the sharp strengthening of sterling against the euro.

      "bodyText": "The head of one of the world's biggest car companies reignited the debate over the single currency yesterday with a warning for the government that its \u00a31.5bn investment in the UK would be at risk if Britain stayed out of the euro. Executives of Japan's biggest car manufacturer, Toyota, which employs thousands of workers at plants in Derbyshire and Clywd, said they could no longer sit on the fence as Britain decides whether or not to enter Emu. \"Waiting for a decision is really hurting us and it is time to state very clearly to the British public that we want Britain to join the single currency,\" said Shoichiro Toyoda, honorary chairman and former chief executive officer of Toyota. The comments are sure to increase the pressure on the government and come days after the trade and industry secretary, Stephen Byers, admitted that big business was telling ministers that they must make a decision on the euro early in the next parliament. Toyota's broadside echoes earlier calls by senior figures from industry to sign up to the single currency. The chairman of Rover Group, Prof W Samann, told reporters recently that full membership of the euro would \"consolidate BMW's investment\" in Britain. Naoyuki Akikusa, the president of Fujitsu, went further last year. \"If the UK were to join in 2002, that would be OK. But if 2020 - that would pose a big problem.\" Toyota managers said yesterday that its UK operations, including a new \u00a3200m plant at Burnaston, Derbyshire, would be at risk if the strong pound continued to push its British operations deep into the red. The company said its British operation had suffered its worst performance ever last year as a result of the sharp strengthening of sterling against the euro. This currency fluctuation hurts the competitiveness of the 200,000 Toyota cars produced each year in the UK, 70% of which are sold elsewhere in Europe. \"The figures are not yet available, but we posted a very significant loss in the UK last year,\" said Shinro Iwatsuki, di rector in charge of European operations. \"I would imagine that Ford, Vauxhall and Rover are in a similar position.\" He said Toyota sent a senior delegation to Mr Byers last month to express its concerns. \"We told him that if the present situation continues, then at the very least it will be impossible to expand our operations in the UK. If there is no change in the long term, then we will have to decide whether even our existing operations should continue.\" The comments, which represent the clearest indication yet of Japanese frustration with Britain's prevarication on the euro, will send shudders through manufacturing industry. Trade union figures show that more than 1m jobs could be lost unless the government signs up for the single currency within 30 months. Since its opening in 1992, Toyota's Burnaston factory has expanded rapidly and its output almost doubled last year to 200,000 cars. The Deeside plant in Clywd is one of the world's largest engine plants.

While unobjectionable, if somewhat dull in themselves, their significance lies in their smack of state-written lesson plans. Such a perception matters if we are serious about encouraging innovation, especially as the curriculum is already so constrained, and set to become more so, by the demands of examinations. Of course the majority may well ignore any one these \"voluntary\" proposals, but their very existence means that schools and departments anxious to do well at Ofsted and in the league tables feel pressured to implement them. If Blair and his colleagues are genuine in their desire to create an innovative and creative economy through a high-quality educational system, and I believe they are, then they must be more rigorously consistent in the measures they introduce and resist the temptation of further prescription in our schools. If they do not, recruitment figures into the teaching profession may continue to fall, as only the most vocationally dedicated are motivated to sign up; many of the talented will leave, frustrated at the lack of room for manoeuvre, and pupils will be left with an increasingly rigid but testable diet. Of course, letting go is a risk - but then genuine innovation always is.",

The growth in the number of assistants employed during the past 10 years has been phenomenal - the last estimate by the Department for Education and Employment was that 90,000 were employed in all types of school, and 5,000 new posts were promised last Easter through the Additional Literacy Support scheme. </p> <p>However, most assistants have no employment security whatsoever, and can and do lose their jobs through squeezes in school budgets, or even simply because one pupil with special educational needs has left their school. The government's promise that training to an approved standard would be available to all assistants and the most able and committed could go on to qualify as teachers has not begun to happen. It is time to ask why, and to do something about it. </p> <p>The assistants' predicament is a prime example of the effects of Tony Blair's \"forces of conservatism\", led, on this occasion, by the education department. The department supervised the original training course for Specialist Teacher Assistants in infant schools, which offered assistants training to university standard, including credits towards degrees or other qualifications, including NVQs. This was assessed by HMI and generally found to be effective, and commonsense would have suggested expansion of the work to assistants in junior and secondary schools. </p> <p>However, Sir Humphrey dug his heels in, prevented any expansion of the scope of the training and in effect ensured that there was no nationally approved training available for assistants working with children older than seven. This was followed by a turf war between the department and the Teacher Training Agency, which prevented any significant contribution to the work from that quarter, including any new schemes for qualified teacher status. Those of us whose main concern was to ensure that assistants had the training they needed were amazed at this bone-headed obstructionism, and are more amazed yet that it should still be in place. </p> <p>The department's attitude, however, has been complemented by resistance - often covert - from professional associations determined to defend existing hierarchies, and by teacher training institutions that are fighting to retain as much of their autonomy as possible in the face of government policies to which many of their leaders are personally opposed. </p> <p>It would, for example, be a very simple operation to devise a distance-learning course for assistants that could be carried out, with external support, in their own school, with minimal disruption to their working hours and families. Units could be based on specific teaching skills, linked to the national literacy and numeracy strategies, and complemented by more advanced reading supervised by a tutor to degree standard. </p> <p>Special arrangements would be needed to ensure initial qualifications in GCSE English and mathematics for those who did not already have them - although a surprising number of assistants are now graduates - and the service could look forward to a small but steady stream of experienced, qualified and highly motivated teachers. This would be particularly helpful in areas such as Newham in London, where the stability of school staffing is threatened by property prices and where incomers do not always have the same understanding of local children as people who have brought up their own children in the community. </p> <p>Because most assistants, like Ann Wood, have family commitments that would prevent them from qualifying as teachers through the normal full-time route, the course needs to be brought to them, and integrated into the work they are doing. </p> <p>This would, however, take a strong lead from a central authority with a clear vision of what assistants can achieve, and the means to put the necessary courses into place. If existing authorities and providers can't or won't do it, the government should create new ones that will. </p> <p>David Blunkett has shown he is prepared to drive new ideas forward. If he really wants to release the full potential of assistants for the benefit of children in schools, he will have to take forceful personal action, and not let up until he has shaken the hands of the first batch of graduates.</p>",

The department's attitude, however, has been complemented by resistance - often covert - from professional associations determined to defend existing hierarchies, and by teacher training institutions that are fighting to retain as much of their autonomy as possible in the face of government policies to which many of their leaders are personally opposed. It would, for example, be a very simple operation to devise a distance-learning course for assistants that could be carried out, with external support, in their own school, with minimal disruption to their working hours and families. Units could be based on specific teaching skills, linked to the national literacy and numeracy strategies, and complemented by more advanced reading supervised by a tutor to degree standard. Special arrangements would be needed to ensure initial qualifications in GCSE English and mathematics for those who did not already have them - although a surprising number of assistants are now graduates - and the service could look forward to a small but steady stream of experienced, qualified and highly motivated teachers. This would be particularly helpful in areas such as Newham in London, where the stability of school staffing is threatened by property prices and where incomers do not always have the same understanding of local children as people who have brought up their own children in the community. Because most assistants, like Ann Wood, have family commitments that would prevent them from qualifying as teachers through the normal full-time route, the course needs to be brought to them, and integrated into the work they are doing. This would, however, take a strong lead from a central authority with a clear vision of what assistants can achieve, and the means to put the necessary courses into place. If existing authorities and providers can't or won't do it, the government should create new ones that will. David Blunkett has shown he is prepared to drive new ideas forward. If he really wants to release the full potential of assistants for the benefit of children in schools, he will have to take forceful personal action, and not let up until he has shaken the hands of the first batch of graduates.",

Clearly a BBC producer had had a brainwave. </p> <p>When I received the invitation to spend three days at Luton living in a hostel, and being treated like any other student, I hesitated for about two minutes. Was I being \"set up\"? Almost certainly yes. Was that a reason to turn down the opportunity to see a new university from the inside, to look at a new subject, to get a feel for modern student life, and to see the world from the vantage point of today's 20-year-old? Almost certainly not. </p> <p>The first night started well. We were kindly cooked a meal by some of our flatmates in the hostel where we were staying. The conversation flowed with increasing naturalness and good humour. But there was little chance of sleep. Until 4 in the morning the courtyard outside the hostel reverberated to the sounds of revelry - students returning from parties or clubs. Most surprisingly, this was only Monday and there seemed no special cause for celebration. </p> <p>I could only hope that after one sleepless night I would be sufficiently tired the next night not to notice. I was. </p> <p>Lectures the next morning were based on clips of various TV drama series and soap operas. Many of the points made were technical - why a particular camera angle was chosen rather than another, or how figures were composed within the frame of the camera. I had never looked at television that way before and I enjoyed it. </p> <p>The course seemed to shy away from analysis of substance - even in the case of classic feature films that would have warranted it. There seemed to be little attempt to develop a rigorous critical faculty in the students. One lecturer conceded publicly that, since most of his students aspired to a career in television, he would risk demotivating them if he encouraged them to see how superficial and unoriginal so much of the content of television is. That of course was depressing - I'd have hoped he would aspire to help a new generation raise its game. </p> <p>Another lecturer was clearly - I think largely unconsciously - in the grip of postmodernism: it all depended on what you liked, it was impossible to make objective value judgments or establish a hierarchy of quality. </p> <p>There was one venture into content: a very politically correct discussion of racial and sexual stereotypes. Almost as many cliches were expressed in the lecture room as in the soap opera clip on which the discussion was based. On a measure of value added, the session would not have scored high. </p> <p>The practical classes that afternoon and the next day made good sense. We were trained to write a press release, read the news, audition for parts and conduct an audition ourselves. One former actress brought immense flair and enthusiasm to her teaching. No one noticed the passing of time. </p> <p>Did I learn anything from my brief immersion in media studies? Yes - both about the subject itself and the way it is taught. </p> <p>Did I gain any insight into the psyche or life styles of the modern student? Yes: most things don't change - and human nature certainly doesn't. Is Luton University doing an honest job, and would passing a degree there in media studies be a good foundation for a career in the sector? Yes, on both counts. </p> <p>Could they do better? Yes, again. And I think they should start by increasing the pace and the workload, setting rigorous and regular tests, and teaching their students not to be afraid to second-guess the current standards of composition, production and editing, in journalism and television.</p> <p>Quentin Davies is MP for Grantham and Stamford. </p> <p><strong>Dai John:</strong> Should the University of Luton allow three MPs to experience a three-year course in just three days?

All societies have elites: healthy societies have several. </p> <p>The populist notion that we can live in a world without elites is as fatuous and as dangerous as the notion that we can live in a world without power. But an open society needs open elites, and modern Britain's elites are nothing like open enough. We no longer live in the world of Hilaire Belloc's Lord Lundy: </p> <p> We had intended you to be The next Prime Minister but three The stocks were sold; the press was squared The Middle Class was quite prepared But as it is!... My language fails! Go out and govern New South Wales!</p> <p>But we still have a long way to go before we satisfy the basic democratic imperative that careers should be open to talent. </p> <p>Oxbridge has a central role to play in satisfying it.

They may well be the last universities in Europe capable of challenging the dominance of the American ivy league; and it would be a disaster for European, as well as British culture if they lost their ability to do so.</p> <p>They provide a superbly good undergraduate education - how good, only those who have taught elsewhere in the British university system can appreciate - and no one would gain if it were allowed to deteriorate. They nurture talent and give it room to flower. Though their graduates no longer dominate our elites in the way that they did as recently as 50 years ago, an Oxbridge degree still opens more doors than most. </p> <p>By any standards, then, access to Oxford is a rich prize. We have an obligation to make it available to those most likely to benefit from it, irrespective of their means or background or schooling. We try to do that now. But, with the best will in the world, we are not as successful as we ought to be. Two-thirds of the sixth-formers who get three As at A level are in the state sector, yet only half our entrants come from that sector. This is not due to deliberate discrimination on the part of admissions tutors. </p> <p>The notion that admission to Oxford is controlled by snobs from public schools, anxious to down the state sector, is a fantasy. The foolish anti-elitism that sometimes accompanied the comprehensive revolution and the widening gap between the private and public sectors have both played a part. But it is too easy to sit back and blame social trends, or economic forces, or previous governments. What matters is that there is a large pool of talent in state schools which Oxford does not tap at present, and which we ought to tap - for the university's sake as well as for the sake of the wider society and of the young people who would benefit. </p> <p>Part of the problem is that in a collegiate university, in which 30 self-governing institutions admit and teach undergraduates, it is difficult to mount major, and inevitably risky, new advances from the centre. All too often, the need for consensus dampens enthusiasm and slows the pace of reform. Progress is more likely to come from radical initiatives at the periphery, which will be imitated elsewhere if they succeed.</p> <p>After a lot of careful thought, Mansfield College (fully supported by the university) recently decided that it was time for it to take just such an initiative. The college has always been committed to widening access to Oxford. As a congregationalist foundation, originally set up in the wake of Gladstone's legislation breaking the Anglican monopoly of the ancient universities, its ethos has always been open, democratic and iconoclastic. And having become a full college of the university four years ago, it is now in a better position to break new ground. </p> <p>Accordingly, we have now launched an ambitious access initiative, designed to raise our own state-sector entry by around 15% over six years, without lowering standards. At 58% of the total, our state-sector entry is already much higher than the university average, but we are confident that we can raise it well above that without quotas or \"positive discrimination\" and without sacrificing our commitment to academic excellence.</p> <p>We plan to do this by targeting further education colleges, the sector with the lowest Oxford application rate. Four other Oxford colleges - Harris Manchester, Hertford, Keble and St. Hugh's - have so far agreed to join us; and we are now looking for a fifth. We see ourselves as a lever of change in the university as a whole, not just as collegiate entrepreneurs. </p> <p>Applications to Oxford from FE colleges - not including sixth-form colleges - for the year 1999-2000 totalled 379; the success rate was just under 30%. Applications from independent schools for the same year totalled 3,778, with a success rate of 44.5%. Of course, special factors need to be taken into account. Some FE colleges have few A-level students and specialise in vocational and recreational courses. But that is not a reason for doing nothing. </p> <p>After surveying selected FE colleges and holding a remarkably productive workshop with relevant FE teachers, we are convinced that there is an untapped pool of suitable talent in the sector, and that the chief reason why it is untapped is that the application rate to Oxford is too low. We are also convinced that we can and should take positive steps to break down the barriers created by habit, ignorance, lack of self-confidence and (in some cases) negative stereotyping which have kept the rate low in the past. </p> <p>We shall offer places to FE candidates on the same basis that we offer places to all other candidates: because we believe, on the basis of the evidence available to us, that they have the potential to benefit from the special kind of education that Oxford offers. The object is to attract more candidates from the sector. We have no intention of offering places to unworthy candidates. </p> <p>How will it work? Three aspects of the scheme seem to us crucial. In the first place, we want to raise funds to employ a dedicated access officer, with experience of the FE sector, to act as an assistant to the admissions tutor. He or she would act as a kind of missionary, making personal approaches to selected colleges, visiting them and meeting interested students. </p> <p>Second, we want to establish individual mentoring links, by mail or email, between existing Mansfield students and FE students who are wondering whether to apply. </p> <p>Third, and perhaps most important, we are seeking funding to enable us to mount a special induction programme for candidates who have received an offer of a place and gained the expected grades, before they take up their places. </p> <p>All of these will require resources which, as the poorest college in the university, we do not yet possess. But it is the hinge on which our newly launched development campaign turns, and we are looking to the future with confidence.</p> <p>\u0095 David Marquand is principal of Mansfield College, Oxford.</p>",

Third, and perhaps most important, we are seeking funding to enable us to mount a special induction programme for candidates who have received an offer of a place and gained the expected grades, before they take up their places. All of these will require resources which, as the poorest college in the university, we do not yet possess. But it is the hinge on which our newly launched development campaign turns, and we are looking to the future with confidence. \u0095 David Marquand is principal of Mansfield College, Oxford.",

The whole package is worth \u00a320m and comes on a first come, first served basis. </p> <p>At a packed opening ceremony at the biggest Bett show yet, the minister also announced the first stage of the national roll-out in fast-speed (broadband) internet technology across 80 local education authorities in England, and invited tenders to produce courses using multimedia technologies at key stage 3 as part of a drive to create whole courses with ICT. </p> <p>He said that with computer power doubling every 18 months, ICT skills had to be constantly refreshed. \"These technologies offer vital weapons for democratic empowerment and civic activism for the excluded and the illiterate. If [the digital divide] is not tackled, it will entrench existing inequalities for generations.\" </p> <p>Bett's organisers, however, cannot be blamed for a lack of new ideas to encourage teachers. This year, some 600 Birmingham teachers paid a subsidised return fare on two specially chartered trains to Olympia, including ICT training on one. </p> <p>\"It was a brilliant idea,\" said Ken Morris, deputy head of Harborne Hill Secondary School, Birmingham. \"Where I sat down, I got chatting to people about a range of things.\" </p> <p>He enjoyed the Birmingham Grid for Learning launch on the Cisco stand. \"You can log on to Aston Hall, a stately home which local schools visit.

      "bodyText": "The government dipped into its ICT treasure chest again last week, when the technology and learning minister Michael Wills announced that teachers in England can apply for a 50% subsidy towards the cost of buying their own computers, up to a limit of \u00a3500. The whole package is worth \u00a320m and comes on a first come, first served basis. At a packed opening ceremony at the biggest Bett show yet, the minister also announced the first stage of the national roll-out in fast-speed (broadband) internet technology across 80 local education authorities in England, and invited tenders to produce courses using multimedia technologies at key stage 3 as part of a drive to create whole courses with ICT. He said that with computer power doubling every 18 months, ICT skills had to be constantly refreshed. \"These technologies offer vital weapons for democratic empowerment and civic activism for the excluded and the illiterate. If [the digital divide] is not tackled, it will entrench existing inequalities for generations.\" Bett's organisers, however, cannot be blamed for a lack of new ideas to encourage teachers. This year, some 600 Birmingham teachers paid a subsidised return fare on two specially chartered trains to Olympia, including ICT training on one. \"It was a brilliant idea,\" said Ken Morris, deputy head of Harborne Hill Secondary School, Birmingham. \"Where I sat down, I got chatting to people about a range of things.\" He enjoyed the Birmingham Grid for Learning launch on the Cisco stand. \"You can log on to Aston Hall, a stately home which local schools visit. Kids can get background information before they go there.\" He was also impressed with IBM's voice facility, which decodes speech to display it as text on screen. Among the glitz of more than 350 exhibitors this year, software launches all took second place to that of the Home Farm Trust and its partner, special needs software publisher Semerc.

      "body": "<p>Hospitals are being told they must bear the full cost of the inflation-plus pay rises announced yesterday for all their staff, including 7.8% for experienced ward nurses, as the NHS seeks to recover from the ravages of the flu outbreak. </p> <p>Ministers made clear there would be no extra funding for the rises over and above the increase of 6.8% in cash terms, or 4.3% after allowing for inflation, already allocated to local health authorities. </p> <p>Health managers admitted they did have enough money to cope. But they warned there would be little left to invest in the kind of new, improved services demanded by Tony Blair as hard evidence of the government's commitment to modernise the health service. </p> <p>Stephen Thornton, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents health authorities and trusts, said the coming financial year would be \"one of our toughest on record\". </p> <p>The pay awards and offers for almost 1m health workers were largely well received and last night appeared to have bought the government a breathing space after the past fortnight's torrent of criticism of the state of health care. </p> <p>However, a Guardian/ICM opinion poll today shows strong public backing for further pay rises for nurses, doctors and ambulance crews, as well as teachers, and pay cuts for ministers, MPs and senior civil servants. </p> <p>Yesterday's rises, effective from April, represent government acceptance in full of pay review body recommendations for nurses, midwives, health visitors and therapists, who get 3.4%, and doctors and dentists, who get 3.3%. Inflation is currently 2.2%. </p> <p>In addition, the government confirmed it was offering other health workers a radical, three-year pay deal, backdated to last April, giving them an above-inflation increase each year. The overall impact on hospitals is likely to be an increase of 3.6% in their pay bills for 2000/01, accounting for a quarter of their increased funds. But John Denham, health minister, said they would get no additional government help. </p> <p>\"We made an allocation, a good one well ahead of inflation, for the health service at local level from which they have to meet all of their expenses,\" Mr Denham said. \"It's nonsense to suggest there is any contradiction between paying staff and paying for the rest of the health service. </p> <p>\"If a local hospital is able to avoid staffing difficulties, if it can recruit and retain its nurses, then it is delivering extra services to patients with those extra resources.\" </p> <p>Ministers were yesterday refusing to be drawn on what the NHS could get in cash terms if the government succeeds in achieving Mr Blair's ambition, revealed on Sunday, to get British health spending in line with the European average within the next six years. Estimates stretch to \u00a316bn, more than a third as much again as the current budget. </p> <p>The TUC is suggesting that the government could spend an extra \u00a331bn on public services as a whole over the next three years without breaking the treasury's rules for balancing its books. In its submission to the government's next three-year spending round, the TUC says the cash is available because the treasury has revised upwards its estimate of how fast the economy can grow while re-basing its spending projections on a lower limit. </p> <p>The big winners from yesterday's pay awards will be 60,000 staff nurses stuck at the top of their grade E scale. Through the creation of an extra scale point they will get a 7.8% rise, worth almost \u00a31,400 a year, which will put them on a basic \u00a319,220. The health department says that, on average, such nurses earn an extra \u00a32,000 from allowances. </p> <p>Also benefiting from the creation of extra scale points are 5,500 long-serving enrolled nurses and nursing auxiliaries stuck at the top of grade C, who similarly get a 7% rise, and 4,500 experienced physiotherapists, occupational therapists and others who get 8.4%. </p> <p>After last year's pay awards helped boost recruitment to nursing by raising starting pay substantially, this year's are seen as a move to improve the retention of existing staff. There are about 15,000 nursing vacancies. </p> <p>Andrew Foster, human resources director of the NHS Confederation, said a qualified nurse working full time, with a typical range of allowances, would be earning well over \u00a320,000 a year. </p> <p>Christine Hancock, general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said it was \"encouraging\" that nurses would be getting an above-inflation rise, paid in full, for a second successive year.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Hospitals are being told they must bear the full cost of the inflation-plus pay rises announced yesterday for all their staff, including 7.8% for experienced ward nurses, as the NHS seeks to recover from the ravages of the flu outbreak. Ministers made clear there would be no extra funding for the rises over and above the increase of 6.8% in cash terms, or 4.3% after allowing for inflation, already allocated to local health authorities. Health managers admitted they did have enough money to cope. But they warned there would be little left to invest in the kind of new, improved services demanded by Tony Blair as hard evidence of the government's commitment to modernise the health service. Stephen Thornton, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents health authorities and trusts, said the coming financial year would be \"one of our toughest on record\". The pay awards and offers for almost 1m health workers were largely well received and last night appeared to have bought the government a breathing space after the past fortnight's torrent of criticism of the state of health care. However, a Guardian/ICM opinion poll today shows strong public backing for further pay rises for nurses, doctors and ambulance crews, as well as teachers, and pay cuts for ministers, MPs and senior civil servants. Yesterday's rises, effective from April, represent government acceptance in full of pay review body recommendations for nurses, midwives, health visitors and therapists, who get 3.4%, and doctors and dentists, who get 3.3%. Inflation is currently 2.2%. In addition, the government confirmed it was offering other health workers a radical, three-year pay deal, backdated to last April, giving them an above-inflation increase each year. The overall impact on hospitals is likely to be an increase of 3.6% in their pay bills for 2000/01, accounting for a quarter of their increased funds. But John Denham, health minister, said they would get no additional government help. \"We made an allocation, a good one well ahead of inflation, for the health service at local level from which they have to meet all of their expenses,\" Mr Denham said. \"It's nonsense to suggest there is any contradiction between paying staff and paying for the rest of the health service. \"If a local hospital is able to avoid staffing difficulties, if it can recruit and retain its nurses, then it is delivering extra services to patients with those extra resources.\" Ministers were yesterday refusing to be drawn on what the NHS could get in cash terms if the government succeeds in achieving Mr Blair's ambition, revealed on Sunday, to get British health spending in line with the European average within the next six years. Estimates stretch to \u00a316bn, more than a third as much again as the current budget. The TUC is suggesting that the government could spend an extra \u00a331bn on public services as a whole over the next three years without breaking the treasury's rules for balancing its books. In its submission to the government's next three-year spending round, the TUC says the cash is available because the treasury has revised upwards its estimate of how fast the economy can grow while re-basing its spending projections on a lower limit. The big winners from yesterday's pay awards will be 60,000 staff nurses stuck at the top of their grade E scale. Through the creation of an extra scale point they will get a 7.8% rise, worth almost \u00a31,400 a year, which will put them on a basic \u00a319,220. The health department says that, on average, such nurses earn an extra \u00a32,000 from allowances. Also benefiting from the creation of extra scale points are 5,500 long-serving enrolled nurses and nursing auxiliaries stuck at the top of grade C, who similarly get a 7% rise, and 4,500 experienced physiotherapists, occupational therapists and others who get 8.4%. After last year's pay awards helped boost recruitment to nursing by raising starting pay substantially, this year's are seen as a move to improve the retention of existing staff. There are about 15,000 nursing vacancies. Andrew Foster, human resources director of the NHS Confederation, said a qualified nurse working full time, with a typical range of allowances, would be earning well over \u00a320,000 a year. Christine Hancock, general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said it was \"encouraging\" that nurses would be getting an above-inflation rise, paid in full, for a second successive year.",

That was Labour's biggest mistake, when it stuck to Conservative spending targets - targets which the Tories would never have followed - producing the biggest squeeze on the health service since the late 1980s. Pay awards were not just below inflation, but staged. Services were seriously curtailed, waiting lists rose and staff and patient morale plummeted. It was in this period that Labour lost its crucial political asset: public confidence in its ability to handle the health service. By last September, a Guardian/ICM poll found 41% of the public believed the health service was getting worse - and only 14% could see any improvement.

Even the prime minister has belatedly said so. He could not have been more specific in his Sunday morning television interview: the health service was not getting enough; Germany had a better service because it was spending much more; it would take time to cure the NHS, but he promised by 2006 UK health spending would have been lifted to the average for the European Union. Put that in your pipe and smoke it, Gordon Brown. Not even a chancellor of the exchequer will be able to challenge such a publicly pronounced change of policy. Time for friends of the NHS to celebrate. </p> <p>The precise size of this new injection is difficult to calculate. Downing Street estimates it would require a 5% real increase for each of the next six years, lifting spending by \u00a39bn in real terms. OECD statistics, which show UK spending 6.8% of national income compared to Europe's 8%, would require a \u00a312bn increase to close the gap. An independent analyst yesterday suggested the gap was 1.8% requiring a \u00a316 bn increase. It may be narrower because French and German spending, much higher than ours, is coming down. The moving target may be imprecise, but it remains a good one. </p> <p>Congratulations are due on other fronts. Mr Blair was right to reject charges and private insurance. The first are administratively expensive and the second would not help the people most in need: the elderly. Even more important, he was not bounced into just concentrating on hospitals. One danger of the current row, like earlier ones where the spotlight was on hospitals, was that primary care which deals with nine out of 10 NHS patients, would get forgotten. It has not been, although Labour is in danger of falling into the same trap as the Tories, expanding pilot programmes - in this case walk-in clinics and the new NHS telephone helpline - before a proper evaluation has been made. </p> <p>Yesterday's pay settlement is not as generous as last year's, but it sensibly fills in gaps that last year's left. The big question is whether Mr Blair's ambitious six-year target can be achieved. There could not be a better time to make such a spending commitment, with this year's budget surplus as high as \u00a314bn and next year's even higher. Even rightwing commentators like Patrick Minford have urged higher expenditure.

Lord Russell-Johnston admitted that suspension had been discussed during a three-hour meeting with Russia's acting president, Vladimir Putin, and senior Russian officials. \"We want a ceasefire, we want negotiations, we want the intolerable situation with refugees to be stopped,\" he said. Opening the first talks on Chechnya with the west since he succeeded Boris Yeltsin, Mr Putin appealed for greater understanding of Russia's position and urged delegates to withhold judgment until they had seen the situation in the north Caucasus for themselves, rather than allowing themselves to be swayed by \"propaganda\". He admitted that the situation was \"not easy\", but insisted that it was \"under control\". On Saturday he had admitted that Russia could be fighting in the breakaway republic for some time to come. For the first time Mr Putin signalled that he would accept an \"international presence... in Ingushetia and parts of Chechnya\" to enable information to flow to the world's media. Until now journalists' movements in the region have been restricted. The council delegation is to embark on a fact-finding mission to the north Caucasus today. The prospect of further diplomatic recriminations appeared when a senior official from Portugal - which currently chairs the European Union - said that the EU would debate possible sanctions against Russia because of its actions in Chechnya at a meeting on January 24. Meanwhile Chechnya declared a minor diplomatic coup after winning formal diplomatic recognition from Afghanistan's Taliban government. Afghanistan is the first country to recognise Chechnya as an independent state, but the Taliban itself is still struggling for international recognition. Russia responded immediately by urging further sanctions against the Afghan government. As human rights issues were debated in Moscow, there were claims of a new humanitarian outrage in Chechnya as eyewitnesses said Russian troops near Urus-Martan had opened fire yesterday on a bus carrying refugees, killing the driver and three passengers. It was not known what had prompted the shooting, but Nikolai Koshman, the Kremlin's top political representative in Chechnya, said the perpetrators would be punished. \"As soon as we find out who did this, they will be shot and killed in public,\" he said. Meanwhile the assault on Chechnya continued unabated yesterday, as Russia's high command claimed it had subjected the country to some of the heaviest air strikes in weeks, with pilots flying some 110 raids over 24 hours. A military spokesman said the operation had killed up to 50 Chechen rebels and destroyed several of their strongholds in the mountain gorge of Argun, which leads south through the rebel-held mountains to Georgia. Pilots were said to have deliberately created avalanches to make passes inaccessible to fleeing rebels, but there was no way of verifying these claims. Warplanes once again subjected the capital, Grozny, to heavy bombardment. One rebel commander, Isa Munayev, claimed that at least 18 civilians had died in the latest raids on the city, but with journalists and human rights monitors officially excluded from the war zone, this claim was also impossible to check. In a display of the military command's confidence, the army yesterday began to move its main headquarters from the security of North Ossetia to Khankala, a suburb in the east of Grozny. The senior military commander in Chechnya, General Gennady Troshev said the army's offensive on the capital had reached a \"decisive phase\". However, with doubts about the wisdom of the five month-long war beginning to surface in Moscow, morale among some troops on the ground also appeared to be souring. \"If the Chechens come today we will be easily defeated,\" said Alexei Migulin, a Russian soldier serving near Vedeno. He said the 150 troops stationed with him only had enough ammunition to last 10 minutes.

Doubt about the life of the government, the pre-condition for such a crisis, does not exist. I'm not aware of one practitioner in the field, whether politician or commentator, whose language challenges the premise all find otiose to state, that this life will extend far beyond the next election. If we're at a turning-point, the deviation is of the most insignificant variety - and for a reason that should truly interest historians. The agent of political crisis, otherwise known as the Conservative opposition, is barely present in the minds of voters who put Mr Blair where he is.</p> <p>In a better functioning political system, the government would be in the sort of trouble over the health service that threatened its entire credibility. Here is the project closest to the heart of Labour, binding new and old. Its inadequacy stares us in the face. Individual scandals of human misery are heaped on structural weaknesses putting this country's healthcare behind half of Europe's. The resources which one of the half-dozen wealthiest countries in the world can find to spend on health are shown for what they are: mean, thin-spread, and defensible only by the promise of something better soon which, when Mr Blair made it on Sunday, called on the last reserves alike of his sincerity and our toleration.</p> <p>The shocking state of the NHS provokes discussion. The media don't hold back. Sometimes there are outbursts of genuine fury. But these, in the end, are propelled into the desert air. They surge into a political vaccuum. They pose a threat of disillusion, but never of destruction. They can't rouse anyone to believe other people might do better. They do not get past the terrain commanded by cosmetic spin: by statistics disarmingly cited, promises sincerely made, the 18-year inheritance hauled yet again into the breach. The irresistible fact of calamity is nowhere near meeting the immovable object of retribution.</p> <p>So it is that Jack Straw, another contributor to the worst week the government yet experienced, needs nothing more than a thick skin to enable him to survive. Survival, even embarrassment, is not among his concerns. A week that he began by trailing the partial abolition of jury-trial and ended by using his discretion, at the behest of Frank Warren and BSkyB, to let in the world champion heavyweight rapist for a boxing match, should have called forth an outcry that would make him think. But the Tories, even when he is not mimicking them, cannot make him think. There is an outcry. But it does not touch him. He has nothing to fear. The caravan will move on, down a road where all turning-points are a mirage.</p> <p>The reason the Tories cannot make the government think is partly that they have deplorably little to say. They're complicit in their own exile from the public mind. They seem to be as aware as everyone else that they will not return to power, and the proof of this is their lack of preparation for doing so. On health, they have nothing to offer but vague waftings in the direction of private insurance. On all home office questions, they speak with faltering voice, the bellows of their famous spokesman compromised by the legacy she is obliged to defend. By their want of substance, they do much to help falsify all these prophecies that Mr Blair's charmed life is ending and that he's about to face an appointment with historic destiny.</p> <p>But emptiness is not their main problem. They have a broader lack of credibility. Even a policy programme that matched the wisdom of Jefferson and the moral vigour of Gladstone would struggle for an audience, at a time when so few people believe William Hague and his party are at a phase in the political cycle where anyone must pay them attention. This may be a circular puzzle. Which comes first, the message or the audience that is ready to hear it? At present, it is hard not to be impressed by the cavernous void of belief that attends Mr Hague's very existence as a leader: the axiomatic public indifference to anything he says: the power of his political failure to be a self-fulfilling guarantee of its continuation.</p> <p>Yet until the Tories crack this, the government's impunity will continue. It is a profoundly undesirable situation, which makes one see more clearly what should happen in the London mayoral contest. By winning it, Steve Norris could begin to retrieve the Tory party from being a non-event, something the system badly needs. Though not a front-rank figure, he has several qualities, the first of which is that he is not an anti-European right-wing lunatic, wedded to doctrines or buried in feuds that disqualify him from public acceptance. He's a pragmatic, loud-voiced, human and humorous figure who knows a lot about transport, the problem he will have most power to do something about. As an individual with talents relevant to London, not mired in the sub-textual political battles that any of the Labour candidates will spend half their time fighting inside their party, he would come to the job with clean hands.</p> <p>He would also be able to take on the government, within the limited field the law leaves open, in a way mayoral devolution is meant to allow for. Londoners would be witness to the kind of political dialogue, between rival legitimacies, that gives life to democracy. Norris would make a better job of this than Ken Livingstone, whose arguments against the treasury would be laced with bitter personal animus on both sides. Livingstone as mayor will be barely more acceptable to the Blairite nervous-system than Livingstone as candidate, and offer nothing, by way of compensation, to the quality of politics.</p> <p>Frank Dobson, for his part, will never rise above the feeble toady. This is what the government wants - which is becoming a bad reason, ex hypothesi , for supporting it. Steve Norris, on the other hand, would become the most important Conservative after William Hague: not, perhaps, an irresistible eminence, but one from which the Tories might start to leverage their return towards sanity and credibility, a democratic force of which ministers one day had genuine reason to be apprehensive.</p>",

If the home secretary remains inclined to follow medical advice that Gen Pinochet is too ill to stand trial, the 84-year-old could be home by the end of the week.</p> <p>Mr Lagos has promised that over 50 civil actions brought against Gen Pinochet on behalf of the approximately 3,000 people who were murdered or disappeared under his rule from 1973 to 1990 will proceed unimpeded. It is suggested that military files hitherto kept secret may be opened; and that, for the first time in Chile, Gen Pinochet may be ordered to face official questioning about the killing, torture and repression which followed the assassination of the country's last socialist president, Salvador Allende, in the US-backed coup. If a prosecution ensues, Mr Lagos says he is ready to amend the constitution to lift the general's parliamentary immunity.</p> <p>All the same, the legal process is likely to be at least as protracted as Britain's and could well outlast the general himself. And while Chile's new president has pledged to safeguard the judicial inquiries, he and a majority of his compatriots have other priorities after a forward-looking election which focused on economic and social problems.

      "bodyText": "The victory of moderate socialist Ricardo Lagos in Chile's presidential election increases the chances that the country's former dictator, General Augusto Pinochet, may yet be called to account in a court of law. But only slightly. Jack Straw's deadline for final submissions concerning Spain's long-standing extradition request expires today. If the home secretary remains inclined to follow medical advice that Gen Pinochet is too ill to stand trial, the 84-year-old could be home by the end of the week. Mr Lagos has promised that over 50 civil actions brought against Gen Pinochet on behalf of the approximately 3,000 people who were murdered or disappeared under his rule from 1973 to 1990 will proceed unimpeded. It is suggested that military files hitherto kept secret may be opened; and that, for the first time in Chile, Gen Pinochet may be ordered to face official questioning about the killing, torture and repression which followed the assassination of the country's last socialist president, Salvador Allende, in the US-backed coup. If a prosecution ensues, Mr Lagos says he is ready to amend the constitution to lift the general's parliamentary immunity. All the same, the legal process is likely to be at least as protracted as Britain's and could well outlast the general himself. And while Chile's new president has pledged to safeguard the judicial inquiries, he and a majority of his compatriots have other priorities after a forward-looking election which focused on economic and social problems. The campaign revealed broad agreement about the most pressing issues. It also demonstrated, in a close finish between Mr Lagos and his rightwing rival, Joaquin Lavin, that legitimate conservatism, as opposed to Gen Pinochet's illegitimate variety, is regaining its strength. These are signs of a healthy democracy. After the horrors of the past, it was all refreshingly normal. Small political earthquake in Chile, nobody dead.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Michel Odent may be 70 but he is still making waves, if you'll pardon the pun, over 30 years after he pioneered the water birth. Now he says giving birth is strictly women's business. Men would be better off out of the way.</p> <p>Dr Odent is that rare thing, an obstetrician who opposes medical intervention in childbirth, who wants the lights turned down, the heating turned up, and for the woman in labour to listen only to what her body is telling her to do. Intellect and logic have no place.</p> <p>A woman who is giving birth needs to retreat into the primitive part of her brain, he says: \"She is going to another planet, she is going to scream.\" Odent's philosophy is that, to achieve the primal state she needs, a woman must have no stress. Relaxed, she will produce high levels of a hormone called oxytocin which speeds up labour. She may be better off with a woman who has been through it than a man who, in his anxiety for her, will try to talk rationally, distracting her and passing on his fear.</p> <p>Odent knows he is challenging what has become an orthodoxy - 90% of men are now there in the delivery room until the cord is cut. He admits there is little scientific evidence for his view that men can be a hindrance rather than a help, but he has plenty of the anecdotal variety.</p> <p>\"The labour may be going slowly, slowly, and suddenly, for some unexpected reason, the man has to go out. As soon as he is gone, the woman starts to scream and shout, and when he comes back, the baby has been born. I have many stories where the woman says everything was wonderful but unfortunately my husband was not there. It is as if women have two languages. They are convinced they cannot give birth without the participation of the baby's father. But on the day of the birth, they said something different with their body language.\"</p> <p>The presence of the man in the delivery room can lead to other problems, too, Odent believes: \"There are issues about the future sex life of the couple.\" Older women who gave birth when men were expected to stay in the pub are often appalled, he says, at the idea of their partner witnessing the physical spectacle of delivery. \"Sexual attraction is mysterious. Perhaps it needs a bit of mystery.\"</p> <p>At his Primal Health Research Centre in London, Odent has interviewed couples years after the birth for his research into its effect on the lives of both the child and its parents. \"I have seen so many couples who had wonderful births according to the present criteria, yet several years later they divorced. They have remained good friends, but they are not sexual partners any more.\"</p> <p>Finally, he speculates on the existence of a male post-natal depression. \"Are we sure all men can cope with the strong emotional reaction they can have when their wife is in labour? In most cultures, they have rituals for keeping a man busy while his partner is in labour. It is called couvade - hatching.\" Modern birthing practice, he says, makes little allowance for this.</p> <p>In Odent's philosophy, our neglect of the primitive side of our natures is causing sorrow beyond the delivery suite. Birth, love and sexuality are all triggered by the same primal part of the brain. In his recent book, The Scientification of Love, he says oxytocin, the hormone that speeds delivery, is also responsible for falling in love and fulfilling sex. The argument is the same: adrenaline and stress are the enemies of relaxation and sexual arousal. To give birth or to make love, we need soft lighting and gentle music. We need to put our rational thinking sides away.</p> <p>Throughout his life, from the 60s at his radical birthing centre in Pithiviers, France, where he first introduced water as a way of relaxing women in order to reduce drug use and caesareans, to his recent proposal that women should fast before trying to conceive as a way of reducing the chemicals in their bodies, Odent has been controversial. But he has been right before: water births are now accepted and popular. He will be pilloried for his views on men, but he genuinely believes we are at another turning point in childbirth.</p> <p><b>Sean French, novelist and columnist</b><br>I can see all the arguments against men being present. For a start, it's so typical of men, isn't it? Childbirth was one of life's great experiences from which they were excluded and they wanted to gain admission. Why couldn't they begin with other exclusively female activities, like ironing?</p> <p>I know all the stories about men fainting and needing more attention than their wives, or taking photos all the way through, or being pressured into it against their will. In reality (and I've checked this with my wife and I'm allowed to say this), it felt intensely important for both of us that I was there. For nine months, the child had been hers. She had been the one throwing up and wobbling around. Now, from the moment the baby was born, it was going to be ours. This is one of the main events of your life together and it would feel strange not to experience it together.</p> <p>Was I harming my wife by being there? Michel Odent accuses fathers of distracting the mother by asking \"rational questions, forcing them to respond with the intellectual side of the brain\". I'm in the clear. All my questions were entirely irrational.</p> <p><b>Kate Figes, author of Life After Birth</b><br> In the past 10 to 20 years, we have gone from no men being present at the birth to almost every man being there. The arguments for this are clear: it's his child, too, and he can give love and support. The problem is that social and cultural pressure to be there is removing any choice - men find it hard to say they don't think they can handle it and women feel unable to say they don't want him there. It is the women who matter here and while the father can be supportive and his presence is important for bonding with his child, it can lead to the woman being more distraught.</p> <p>As soon as a woman walks into hospital with her partner, she is left alone with him and the monitor. Men become unpaid helpers in the early stages of the birth, but they are emotionally embroiled in it and often less good at dealing with pain, and the danger is that the woman gets less care. She needs a midwife, someone who has been through the experience, to keep her calm, talk her through what's happening, or panic levels can rise. The ultimate answer is that each couple should decide for themselves, independent of outside pressures.</p> <p><b>Sheila Kitzinger, social anthropologist</b><br> It's wrong to be dogmatic about this. It must be the woman's choice and she should be able to assess freely what her needs are. How, for example, is her partner emotionally? Many men are frightened by agonising pain and blood, and some end up siding with the obstetricians to help control the \"little woman\". That makes it very tough on her.</p> <p>The world over, birth has always been woman to woman, but we've lost that female culture of childbirth. Women are often socially isolated now, with even their mothers reluctant to get involved, so the person closest to a pregnant woman may be her partner. I think it's wrong to send the man off because it may be he's the best person to be there, but he should be psychologically and physiologically prepared. The birth is not a time suddenly to wheel him in. He's not a voyeur or there to keep her in hand, he's there to understand. I've seen classes in the US where men turn up with stopwatches and are referred to as \"coaches\" as if they're preparing for a boxing ring. This is missing out on the love and tenderness that can flow between a couple in childbirth.</p> <p><b>Anthony Silverstone, obstetrician/gynaecologist<br></b>Childbirth is a complicated issue and there are so many variables involved, but people should have the confidence to choose who is present. Of course fathers should not be stigmatised for not attending, but I believe most fathers want to be there and most mothers want them there.</p> <p>It used to be routine to ask the father to leave - I was sent out of the room when my first child was born - but now that's exceptional. Of course there are times when it's not advisable, or when he can be vulnerable and his presence not helpful, but generally I think it's a good thing. If you ask him to leave, he misses out and she misses him. It's one of the most important moments in a couple's life together and they should share it.</p> <p>As for the increase in caesareans, I'm not convinced it is related to more fathers attending births. When I was a young doctor, the caesarean rate was 9-10%, now it's up to 20-21%. Fathers or no fathers, things have changed out of all recognition.</p> <p>\u0095 Anthony Silverstone is consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at University College London Hospital.</p> <p><b>Anne Woollett, psychologist</b><br>No woman should feel obliged to have the man there. It's an emotionally charged situation and it depends on the dynamic between the couple. If the woman is the one who does the looking after, he's not going to be much use because he's not got any experience of how to look after her.</p> <p>Childbirth is scary and men are often very anxious. They want to find solutions to her pain and when they can't, they feel powerless. What matters is whether they listen to what she wants and are sympathetic.</p> <p>Another dynamic is the fact that her genitals are exposed to the world. In a relationship, they are exposed only to him. It is hard for some men to share that with a male doctor and it can affect a couple's sex life.</p> <p>One thing we're more aware of now is domestic violence in pregnancy. The birth of a first child is a shift from a twosome to a threesome and some men feel emotionally shaky when they see their partner more engrossed with her body and the baby than with him. In this case, it is not right for him to be at the birth.</p> <p>\u0095 Anne Woollett is Professor of Developmental Psychology at the University of East London.</p>",

Childbirth was one of life's great experiences from which they were excluded and they wanted to gain admission. Why couldn't they begin with other exclusively female activities, like ironing? I know all the stories about men fainting and needing more attention than their wives, or taking photos all the way through, or being pressured into it against their will. In reality (and I've checked this with my wife and I'm allowed to say this), it felt intensely important for both of us that I was there. For nine months, the child had been hers. She had been the one throwing up and wobbling around. Now, from the moment the baby was born, it was going to be ours. This is one of the main events of your life together and it would feel strange not to experience it together. Was I harming my wife by being there? Michel Odent accuses fathers of distracting the mother by asking \"rational questions, forcing them to respond with the intellectual side of the brain\". I'm in the clear. All my questions were entirely irrational. Kate Figes, author of Life After Birth In the past 10 to 20 years, we have gone from no men being present at the birth to almost every man being there. The arguments for this are clear: it's his child, too, and he can give love and support. The problem is that social and cultural pressure to be there is removing any choice - men find it hard to say they don't think they can handle it and women feel unable to say they don't want him there. It is the women who matter here and while the father can be supportive and his presence is important for bonding with his child, it can lead to the woman being more distraught. As soon as a woman walks into hospital with her partner, she is left alone with him and the monitor. Men become unpaid helpers in the early stages of the birth, but they are emotionally embroiled in it and often less good at dealing with pain, and the danger is that the woman gets less care. She needs a midwife, someone who has been through the experience, to keep her calm, talk her through what's happening, or panic levels can rise. The ultimate answer is that each couple should decide for themselves, independent of outside pressures. Sheila Kitzinger, social anthropologist It's wrong to be dogmatic about this. It must be the woman's choice and she should be able to assess freely what her needs are. How, for example, is her partner emotionally? Many men are frightened by agonising pain and blood, and some end up siding with the obstetricians to help control the \"little woman\". That makes it very tough on her. The world over, birth has always been woman to woman, but we've lost that female culture of childbirth. Women are often socially isolated now, with even their mothers reluctant to get involved, so the person closest to a pregnant woman may be her partner. I think it's wrong to send the man off because it may be he's the best person to be there, but he should be psychologically and physiologically prepared. The birth is not a time suddenly to wheel him in. He's not a voyeur or there to keep her in hand, he's there to understand. I've seen classes in the US where men turn up with stopwatches and are referred to as \"coaches\" as if they're preparing for a boxing ring. This is missing out on the love and tenderness that can flow between a couple in childbirth. Anthony Silverstone, obstetrician/gynaecologist Childbirth is a complicated issue and there are so many variables involved, but people should have the confidence to choose who is present. Of course fathers should not be stigmatised for not attending, but I believe most fathers want to be there and most mothers want them there. It used to be routine to ask the father to leave - I was sent out of the room when my first child was born - but now that's exceptional. Of course there are times when it's not advisable, or when he can be vulnerable and his presence not helpful, but generally I think it's a good thing. If you ask him to leave, he misses out and she misses him. It's one of the most important moments in a couple's life together and they should share it. As for the increase in caesareans, I'm not convinced it is related to more fathers attending births. When I was a young doctor, the caesarean rate was 9-10%, now it's up to 20-21%. Fathers or no fathers, things have changed out of all recognition. \u0095 Anthony Silverstone is consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at University College London Hospital. Anne Woollett, psychologist No woman should feel obliged to have the man there. It's an emotionally charged situation and it depends on the dynamic between the couple. If the woman is the one who does the looking after, he's not going to be much use because he's not got any experience of how to look after her. Childbirth is scary and men are often very anxious. They want to find solutions to her pain and when they can't, they feel powerless. What matters is whether they listen to what she wants and are sympathetic. Another dynamic is the fact that her genitals are exposed to the world. In a relationship, they are exposed only to him. It is hard for some men to share that with a male doctor and it can affect a couple's sex life. One thing we're more aware of now is domestic violence in pregnancy. The birth of a first child is a shift from a twosome to a threesome and some men feel emotionally shaky when they see their partner more engrossed with her body and the baby than with him. In this case, it is not right for him to be at the birth. \u0095 Anne Woollett is Professor of Developmental Psychology at the University of East London.",

He assumed that the Mersey tunnel company would allow the ambulance through, take the relevant details and submit an invoice,\" he said. \"The Mersey tunnel attendant and supervisor, however, refused to allow the ambulance through the barrier without payment, suggesting that the ambulance would have to find an alternative route to Chester. \"The ambulance was delayed by around 15 minutes, while the paramedic tried to reason with the tunnel staff.\" David Hill, chief executive of Lancashire ambulance service, said: \"I appreciate that the tunnel attendant would be following orders but I would have hoped that in such circumstances reason would prevail in the best interests of the patient. \"The ambulance was clearly marked and identifiable, the crew were in uniform and the paramedic explained that there was a very sick patient on board, accompanied by a nurse and doctor. \"As it happened, the patient's condition did not deteriorate during the ambulance journey as a result of the delay.\" A spokesman for the NHS regional executive said: \"Although the facts are still being investigated, this sounds like an extremely unfortunate incident which should not have happened. \"All concerned in these circumstances should be aware that the well-being of a very sick patient must come before other considerations.\" But John Gillard, general manager of Mersey Tunnels, said an investigation was taking place. He said: \"Normally there are two procedures which take place. First, the ambulance service notifies us as soon as it can that they are coming and they are given priority treatment. \"If they cannot contact us -and are on a blue light - then they are also given top priority. These measures work extremely well but on this occasion neither of these happened. We are very sorry that it did happen, and we don't yet understand why it happened. \"It is believed that the ambulance was not showing its blue light.\"",

      "bodyText": "A former roofer who suffered brain damage in a 40ft fall yesterday won a near record \u00a31m compensation and was given the go ahead to appeal for a higher amount. Neville Edwards, 29, of Newcastle upon Tyne, was left virtually unable to communicate and needing 24-hour care after the accident in October 1993. Recorder Ben Nolan QC awarded Mr Edwards a total of \u00a3985,620 in a case the worker's solicitors claimed had major implications for other injured employees. He was given leave to ask the court of appeal to double \u00a388,400 awarded for pain and suffering calculated under the current system. And the recorder also increased the sum covering his future loss of earnings to \u00a3703,500 after accepting investments would grow by 2% above inflation rather than the 3% normally accepted. Philip Davison of Thompsons Solicitors, who represented Mr Edwards, predicted the total could reach seven-figures and force firms to take safety far more seriously. \"The courts need to recognise that the current awards for pain and suffering are massively out of date and the sooner that they award realistic compensation, for what victims like Neville will have to live with for the rest of their lives, the better,\" he said. The case is by far the biggest of four involving compensation for pain and suffering the appeal court will consider after a law commission proposal two years ago that amounts should be doubled. Courts now calculate awards from judicial guidelines that would put a maximum \u00a3125,000 on a case involving a victim left in a permanent vegetative state. Mr Edwards was also awarded \u00a3156,500 for losses during his 76-month legal battle and other sums totaling \u00a337,220. He plummeted 40 ft from a pitched roof while stripping asbestos without any safety equipment. A spokesman for his former employer, Team Roofing, could not be contacted last night. Mr Edwards was backed throughout his legal fight by the AEEU engineering union.\"I could never have fought without the backing of my union,\" he said. Sir Ken Jackson, AEEU general secretary, said: \"No amount of compensation can ever make up for the pain and suffering caused to Neville.

      "bodyText": "A teacher preparing boys for one of Britain's leading Catholic public schools betrayed his pupils' trust and became a serial abuser, a court was told yesterday. But on the first day of his trial, one of Robert \"Rory\" O'Brien's alleged victims admitted lying in statements to police and acknowledged that his schooldays had been \"a complete disaster\" until the head helped him to cope. O'Brien, 57 and a father of five, denies preying on children at St Mary's Hall prep school in Lancashire, which is the main feeder school for nearby Stonyhurst College. He pleaded not guilty to six charges of indecent assault on four pupils going back to 1972. The former head of the prep school was described at Preston crown court as a teacher whose double life was an abuse of his position. Prosecutor Elizabeth Nicholls said that O'Brien had even contacted one of his alleged victims 20 years later, to see if he had made a complaint - \"pivotal evidence for the crown,\" she said. The court heard that police found semen traces from O'Brien and one of the boys after a forensic search of the head's study at St Mary's, following a complaint two years ago from a man who had been at the school in the early 1970s. Following the investigation, two boys, now aged 15 and 17, contacted police and a fourth alleged victim, a pupil in the 1970s, also came forward. Ms Nicholls said that O'Brien, from Hurst Green, Lancashire, was suspended after the accusations and later took early retirement. She told the jury of five men and seven women: \"At the conclusion of this trial you will have no doubt that Robert O'Brien was a devoted and charismatic teacher. \"Therein lies the tragedy, for Mr O'Brien abused his position of trust and authority and subjected four young boys to sexual abuse.\" The court heard that the first alleged victim, now in his 30s, had been assaulted in a dormitory at the age of 10. O'Brien, who was made head of St Mary's in 1990 after some 20 years' teaching at the school, which takes boys aged six to 13, later used night security patrols to select his victims, Ms Nicholls said. The two teenagers claimed, in separate complaints to police, that the headmaster came into their dormitories when they were aged 12 and 13, shone a torch in their eyes, and took them to his study to indecently assault them. The fourth alleged victim, now in his 30s, told police that he was assaulted until the time he moved on to Stonyhurst, and had been invited back from the college to the prep school for a final meeting with O'Brien. Cross-examined on video-link by defence barrister John Jackson, the 17-year-old boy said that he had lied in a police interview. The boy said that his claim that abuse had only stopped when he hit O'Brien, shortly before leaving for Stonyhurst, had been false. He lied, he said, because he was scared of O'Brien.

      "bodyText": "The Spanish government yesterday forwarded a request from the judge responsible for Augusto Pinochet's arrest demanding he undergo further medical tests in a last ditch attempt to keep the legal case against the former Chilean dictator alive. Spain's foreign ministry said it had forwarded the petition from Judge Baltasar Garzon, asking for medical tests to be carried out by doctors of his choice. The request follows last week's announcement by the home secretary, Jack Straw, that he was \"minded\" to halt extradition proceedings against the general on medical grounds. The campaigning Spanish judge has also reiterated his demand, first made when Gen Pinochet was arrested in October 1998, to be allowed to question the general in person about crimes committed under his 17-year regime. However the request appears to be little more than a final throw of the dice by Judge Garzon. The Spanish government, which has never been comfortable about being caught in the middle of the Pinochet affair, said it had reaffirmed to London that it would not appeal Mr Straw's ruling. In response Chilean sources said Gen Pinochet would never accept a new request for fresh medical tests carried out by doctors chosen by the Spanish prosecutor. \"Gen Pinochet and the Chilean government have never recognised that Judge Garzon has jurisdiction in this matter,\" the source said. \"There is no way he will undergo further medical tests at his or anybody else's request.\" Mr Straw has given interested parties until 5pm today to present submissions objecting to his decision. The home office said it could take several days for Mr Straw to make a final ruling on the Gen Pinochet case, depending on the size and number of the representations received. The Chilean government is clearly not expecting an immediate decision. The air force jet, which has routinely arrived in Britain whenever there has been the semblance of a chance of Gen Pinochet being released, is still in Santiago . Pablo Cabrera, the Chilean ambassador in London, said: \"We have not dispatched any aeroplane yet. We have been wondering whether to do it but we have been behaving very prudently in order not to give any impression of pressure or anxiety.\" Amnesty International and other human rights groups said that they would deliver their formal submissions to the home office at 10.30am today. The representations will concentrate on the fact that Spain and other interested parties have not been given access to the medical reports, allowed to challenge them, or to obtain an independent medical opinion. However any chance of mounting a legal challenge to the medical evidence appeared to be diminishing yesterday when Sir John Grimley Evans, the gerontologist who led the medical team which examined Pinochet, scotched reports that Mr Straw had misled the House of Commons about the reports findings. In a letter to the home office Sir John wrote: \"I consider the home secretary's statements about the report's findings to have been entirely correct and appropriate.\" In London, relatives of the \"disappeared\" urged the Metropolitan police to bring criminal charges against Gen Pinochet if the extradition case against him were to be dropped. A delegation, led by Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn, met Assistant Commissioner David Veness to lobby for an investigation into Gen Pinochet under UK law. Campaigners hope a case brought by Scotland Yard would stop the general leaving the country. Mr Corbyn said Mr Veness had confirmed that Scotland Yard had a file on the general and was considering whether to take any action.",

      "bodyText": "For the first time in 15 years, Britain has only one restaurant worthy of the Michelin guide's coveted three stars, according to the latest edition of the gastronomic review. The Waterside Inn in Bray, near Maidenhead, is now Britain's sole three-star establishment, with French chef-proprietor Michel Roux retaining his top culinary rating for the 16th year running. Marco Pierre White's Oak Room at the Hotel Meridien, and Nico Ladenis's Chez Nico, at the Grosvenor House Hotel, both in central London, have both been dropped, after earning three stars in 1999. The 100th Michelin Red Guide, published yesterday, leaves London - long considered Britain's culinary capital - with not a single dining room with three stars and only four two-star restaurants. Last year, Britain had a trio of top-rated chefs, and while there is little hope of ever outnumbering France's 21 three-starred chefs, the new guide will leave a bad taste for many gourmet diners. Michel Roux, whose luxurious restaurant sits on the banks of the Thames in picturesque Bray, is not the first member of his family to be the sole three-starred chef in Britain. The honour was last held in 1984 by his brother, Albert, at Le Gavroche in London's Mayfair. Despite the loss of two top restaurants from the guide, there was good news for many other restaurateurs, including the Conran empire, which won its first Michelin star for Orrery, in Marylebone. Marco Pierre White and Nico Ladenis contacted Michelin last September and asked to be removed from the guide after White announced that he was retiring from cooking to concentrate on managing his extensive restaurant business, while Ladenis said he was changing direction by bringing down prices and altering his menu. White, the first British chef to win three stars five years ago, said: \"Chasing three stars is more exciting than defending them. Now I have a family, my priorities are different.

He now attends a special school in Cambridge five days a week.</p> <p>The department of education said it would be examining details of the court case to see whether further advice should be given to schools on visits to farms which attract 12m visitors of all ages each year.</p> <p>Healthy cattle and other animals harbour the bugs and spread it through their droppings.</p> <p>Lawyers said Tom's family had suffered severe financial hardship and his parents had broken up. They would be claiming \"several million pounds\" so that his mother could provide the house and care that Tom needed.</p> <p>Tom's mother, Tracy Dowling, said last night: \"This is a huge relief. I am hoping we can perhaps pick up again on life and can have Tom back again and that he gets what he deserves again carewise and everything else.</p> <p>\"He loved animals, children do, and it is hard for me to say children should not go to farms.\" But she had never been properly warned of the risks and allowed to make the choice of whether Tom went on the visit or not. Tom may not even have touched any animals but may have touched a fence or his footwear and then put his hands to his mouth.</p> <p>Her solicitor Jill Greenfield said: \"Stricter controls on open farms must be a priority and, if nothing else, this case should be seen as a warning to all open farms for the need to shape up and realise that young children visiting farms is a serious matter.</p> <p>\"Local authorities must give clear instructions to teachers and make sure that they are carried out. Four-year-old children cannot read signs warning to wash hands. They do not realise the dangers and nor do their parents.\"</p> <p>Caroline Metcalf, solicitor for Bowmans Farms Ltd, said the farm management \"deeply regrets\" what happened to Tom.</p> <p>It had closed voluntarily for five weeks after the incident and conceded there was doubt that information \"customarily given\" by both farm and school had been given on this occasion, she said.</p> <p>\"The farm has been subject to vigorous and exhaustive inspection by the health and safety executive who has made further recommendations, all of which have been implemented.\" More than 150,000 visitors had been to the farm since Tom.</p> <p>Zurich Municipal, the insurers for Barnet education authority, said: \"This was a tragic accident. We are not trying to stop this kind of visit.

      "bodyText": "A six-year-old boy may win millions of pounds in compensation after suffering brain damage from a bug he picked up on a school visit to a farm. Tom Dowling is confined to a wheelchair, cannot move his arms or legs, is fed by a tube through his stomach and can only communicate by blinking and smiling, after the accident in 1997 when he was four. Bowmans Open Farm in Colney, near St Albans in Hertfordshire, and Barnet education authority yesterday admitted most of the liability at the high court in London and agreed to pay \u00a3200,000 towards Tom's 24-hour care before the case is heard to determine the final size of the settlement. The court heard that there had been two other cases of similar poisoning at the farm in the previous six weeks - one involving the son of the managing director. Tom, who has a younger brother Charlie, three, narrowly escaped death from the E.coli 0157 bacteria which attacked his kidneys and brain and left him in a coma for 12 days after the visit with Edgware infants school. He now attends a special school in Cambridge five days a week. The department of education said it would be examining details of the court case to see whether further advice should be given to schools on visits to farms which attract 12m visitors of all ages each year. Healthy cattle and other animals harbour the bugs and spread it through their droppings. Lawyers said Tom's family had suffered severe financial hardship and his parents had broken up. They would be claiming \"several million pounds\" so that his mother could provide the house and care that Tom needed. Tom's mother, Tracy Dowling, said last night: \"This is a huge relief. I am hoping we can perhaps pick up again on life and can have Tom back again and that he gets what he deserves again carewise and everything else. \"He loved animals, children do, and it is hard for me to say children should not go to farms.\" But she had never been properly warned of the risks and allowed to make the choice of whether Tom went on the visit or not. Tom may not even have touched any animals but may have touched a fence or his footwear and then put his hands to his mouth. Her solicitor Jill Greenfield said: \"Stricter controls on open farms must be a priority and, if nothing else, this case should be seen as a warning to all open farms for the need to shape up and realise that young children visiting farms is a serious matter. \"Local authorities must give clear instructions to teachers and make sure that they are carried out. Four-year-old children cannot read signs warning to wash hands. They do not realise the dangers and nor do their parents.\" Caroline Metcalf, solicitor for Bowmans Farms Ltd, said the farm management \"deeply regrets\" what happened to Tom. It had closed voluntarily for five weeks after the incident and conceded there was doubt that information \"customarily given\" by both farm and school had been given on this occasion, she said. \"The farm has been subject to vigorous and exhaustive inspection by the health and safety executive who has made further recommendations, all of which have been implemented.\" More than 150,000 visitors had been to the farm since Tom. Zurich Municipal, the insurers for Barnet education authority, said: \"This was a tragic accident. We are not trying to stop this kind of visit. The world is full of risk but local authorities should take every possible precaution.\" Daniel Brennan QC, representing Tom, told Mr Justice Brian Smedley in court that his parents had been advised to accept the settlement of liability because, although they had a strong case, there were always risks in litigation.

John Allan, 47, has pleaded not guilty to murdering his partner, Cheryl Lewis, at the New Winter Palace hotel in Luxor, Egypt, in October 1998. Opening the case for the prosecution, David Steer, QC, told Liverpool crown court that two days before they were due to finish their week-long holiday, Ms Lewis, 43, a successful lawyer, was taken ill. He told how Pamela Black, an American tourist, was at reception when the defendant said to the receptionist: \"My wife needs a doctor. I think she's dying.\" Ms Black, who had some first aid training, went with Allan to the room where she found Ms Lewis naked on the bed, sweating profusely, barely breathing and foaming from the mouth, Mr Steer said. The authorities in Egypt thought she had died of a heart attack but a specialist in England determined that she had been killed by cyanide. Allan, a businessman who was said to be financially reliant on Ms Lewis, told a holiday representative that he thought Curtis Warren, a drugs dealer, could have been behind the murder, the court heard. However, Mr Steer alleged, Allan had poisoned his girlfriend to gain from the deceased's jewellery and more than \u00a3400,000 from her will. He said police had found floppy disks at the couple's home with three different versions of the will. The court was also told that when a Mercedes car, which had belonged to Ms Lewis, was searched by police, four briquettes of sodium cyanide were found. Ms Lewis, who ran her own practice in the Wirral, lived at Oxton, Birkenhead, with the defendant, who she had been seeing for around seven years since separating from her husband, the court heard.

      "body": "<p>The weekend will no longer need to stop on a Saturday night for clubbers who want to dance the night away as the government yesterday announced plans to remove a 220-year-old law banning Sunday dancing.</p> <p>The plans to remove the ban on commercially organised dancing on Sundays, published in a draft deregulation order laid before parliament yesterday, means that \"Sunday night fever\" could soon sweep the country, according to the government.</p> <p>The order, which will also amend the licensing act 1964, would allow clubs to open their doors on a Sunday and sell alcohol until 12.30am on a Monday. But to meet the concerns of those worried about the relaxation of the Sunday observance act of 1780, the government's proposals include the introduction of a power for licensing authorities to make an order restricting the hours of selling of alcohol to any time they consider appropriate in the light of the special nature of Sunday.</p> <p>These include safeguards such as revoking extended licensing hours if disturbances occur outside premises and imposing an absolute 'last orders' time of 12.30 am for the sale of alcohol.</p> <p>The move brings regulations governing Sunday dancing into line with theatres, cinemas, concerts, amusements, art galleries, sporting events, and zoos.</p> <p>The home office minister Mike O'Brien said: \"This ban is antiquated and should have gone years ago. Our proposals will give freedom of choice for people as well as remove an unnecessary regulation on business. Be it line dancing, square dancing, ballroom or disco, it is plainly daft to have a ban on dancing because it is a Sunday. If people want a bit of Sunday night fever, that's fine with me.</p> <p>\"But we are also conscious of the need to safeguard residents from disturbance and recognise that some people consider Sunday a special day. Our proposals therefore include specific measures to control noise and nuisance, and a power for licensing authorities to take account of the special nature of Sunday.\"</p> <p>The new regulations apply only to England and Wales. Scotland and Northern Ireland have separate laws regulating Sunday entertainment.</p> <p>The move towards more freedom prompted criticism from the Keep Sunday Special campaign.</p> <p>The group's spokesman, John Alexander, said the move would put pressure on young people to go out more at the weekend. \"The temptation of yet another night's entertainment on a Sunday night will mean a lot of young people will be going to school or college the next morning a little bit worse for wear.\"</p> <p>However, a consultation exercise last year showed that councils, police and courts all supported the proposals.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The weekend will no longer need to stop on a Saturday night for clubbers who want to dance the night away as the government yesterday announced plans to remove a 220-year-old law banning Sunday dancing. The plans to remove the ban on commercially organised dancing on Sundays, published in a draft deregulation order laid before parliament yesterday, means that \"Sunday night fever\" could soon sweep the country, according to the government. The order, which will also amend the licensing act 1964, would allow clubs to open their doors on a Sunday and sell alcohol until 12.30am on a Monday. But to meet the concerns of those worried about the relaxation of the Sunday observance act of 1780, the government's proposals include the introduction of a power for licensing authorities to make an order restricting the hours of selling of alcohol to any time they consider appropriate in the light of the special nature of Sunday. These include safeguards such as revoking extended licensing hours if disturbances occur outside premises and imposing an absolute 'last orders' time of 12.30 am for the sale of alcohol. The move brings regulations governing Sunday dancing into line with theatres, cinemas, concerts, amusements, art galleries, sporting events, and zoos. The home office minister Mike O'Brien said: \"This ban is antiquated and should have gone years ago. Our proposals will give freedom of choice for people as well as remove an unnecessary regulation on business. Be it line dancing, square dancing, ballroom or disco, it is plainly daft to have a ban on dancing because it is a Sunday. If people want a bit of Sunday night fever, that's fine with me. \"But we are also conscious of the need to safeguard residents from disturbance and recognise that some people consider Sunday a special day. Our proposals therefore include specific measures to control noise and nuisance, and a power for licensing authorities to take account of the special nature of Sunday.\" The new regulations apply only to England and Wales. Scotland and Northern Ireland have separate laws regulating Sunday entertainment. The move towards more freedom prompted criticism from the Keep Sunday Special campaign. The group's spokesman, John Alexander, said the move would put pressure on young people to go out more at the weekend. \"The temptation of yet another night's entertainment on a Sunday night will mean a lot of young people will be going to school or college the next morning a little bit worse for wear.\" However, a consultation exercise last year showed that councils, police and courts all supported the proposals.",

The setting is Baltimore in 1770, where Samuel Oliphant is trying to run his grocery shop in the face of three appalling offspring, the restlessness of his fellow colonists, and the strain of redcoat billeting regulations. So far, it's unlikely to splinter George Washington's wooden dentures. </p> <p>The title of Raj Persaud's study of psychiatric hospitals, Beyond Bedlam (9.0pm, Radio 4), refers to the 13th-century madhouse whose unfortunate inmates were regularly put on exhibition. These programmes bring out, however, the acute sensitivity of present-day staff to their patients' often intractable problems. Not least of the difficulties is that the side effects of some treatments serve to discourage their continuation after discharge - and back the sufferers must come. </p>",

      "bodyText": "There are about three good laughs in the first episode of Andy Hamilton's new series Revolting People (6.30pm, Radio 4), which makes it stand out sharply in the otherwise featureless landscape of broadcast comedy. The setting is Baltimore in 1770, where Samuel Oliphant is trying to run his grocery shop in the face of three appalling offspring, the restlessness of his fellow colonists, and the strain of redcoat billeting regulations. So far, it's unlikely to splinter George Washington's wooden dentures. The title of Raj Persaud's study of psychiatric hospitals, Beyond Bedlam (9.0pm, Radio 4), refers to the 13th-century madhouse whose unfortunate inmates were regularly put on exhibition. These programmes bring out, however, the acute sensitivity of present-day staff to their patients' often intractable problems. Not least of the difficulties is that the side effects of some treatments serve to discourage their continuation after discharge - and back the sufferers must come.",

      "body": "<p>Aside from a much-needed fillip for the leftwing arm of the ailing Concertacion ruling alliance, Chile's election to the presidency Sunday of socialist candidate Ricardo Lagos was a personal victory of considerable magnitude.</p> <p>The country has, for the first time since Salvador Allende was overthrown in 1973, elected a staunch adversary of General Augusto Pinochet.</p> <p>When armed gunman attempted to kill Gen Pinochet on September 7 1986, Mr Lagos was one of 44 prominent dissidents immediately arrested by the military regime. He was held for three weeks and, although he was never tortured, his brief encounter with state-sponsored thugs provided ample motivation for his next move.</p> <p>Within a year, Mr Lagos had gathered the necessary elements to form the Party for Democracy (PPD), the second most important political force in the coalition of parties that rid the country of military rule.</p> <p>In the 1980s, he worked to bring opposition and civic groups under one banner. His quietly effective organising and his plodding oratory clearly made him a dull alternative to more flashy candidates, but his slow and steady progress helped chip away at the country's authoritarian institutions.</p> <p>In the decade since the military relinquished power to the civilian authorities in 1990, Mr Lagos has steadily positioned himself as the deserving - if undemanding - candidate to run the centre-left Concertacion.</p> <p>When Mr Lagos becomes president in March, he will face an impatient electorate; the past economic recession punctured the Chilean myth that their robust economy was immune to world crisis, forcing an austerity programme on many middle-class families.</p> <p>Whether Mr Lagos will have the personal or political clout to organise a trial of Pinochet remains to be seen. But he will soon face demands that Chile acknowledges its debt to the victims of human rights abuses committed during the Pinochet dictatorship.</p> <p>When demonstrators gathered to celebrate Mr Lagos's victory, the loudest chant was \"a trial for Pinochet\". To which Mr Lagos responded: \"Trials are decided in the courts and [I] will make sure the decisions of the court are respected.\"</p> <p>The issue of human rights abuses hits home for the man who suffered under the Pinochet regime.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Aside from a much-needed fillip for the leftwing arm of the ailing Concertacion ruling alliance, Chile's election to the presidency Sunday of socialist candidate Ricardo Lagos was a personal victory of considerable magnitude. The country has, for the first time since Salvador Allende was overthrown in 1973, elected a staunch adversary of General Augusto Pinochet. When armed gunman attempted to kill Gen Pinochet on September 7 1986, Mr Lagos was one of 44 prominent dissidents immediately arrested by the military regime. He was held for three weeks and, although he was never tortured, his brief encounter with state-sponsored thugs provided ample motivation for his next move. Within a year, Mr Lagos had gathered the necessary elements to form the Party for Democracy (PPD), the second most important political force in the coalition of parties that rid the country of military rule. In the 1980s, he worked to bring opposition and civic groups under one banner. His quietly effective organising and his plodding oratory clearly made him a dull alternative to more flashy candidates, but his slow and steady progress helped chip away at the country's authoritarian institutions. In the decade since the military relinquished power to the civilian authorities in 1990, Mr Lagos has steadily positioned himself as the deserving - if undemanding - candidate to run the centre-left Concertacion. When Mr Lagos becomes president in March, he will face an impatient electorate; the past economic recession punctured the Chilean myth that their robust economy was immune to world crisis, forcing an austerity programme on many middle-class families. Whether Mr Lagos will have the personal or political clout to organise a trial of Pinochet remains to be seen. But he will soon face demands that Chile acknowledges its debt to the victims of human rights abuses committed during the Pinochet dictatorship. When demonstrators gathered to celebrate Mr Lagos's victory, the loudest chant was \"a trial for Pinochet\". To which Mr Lagos responded: \"Trials are decided in the courts and [I] will make sure the decisions of the court are respected.\" The issue of human rights abuses hits home for the man who suffered under the Pinochet regime.",

In the last years, he was looked after by his wife Elisabet Endriss. Ronald Bergan Bernhard Wicki, actor and film director, born October 28 1919; died January 5 2000",

Some US veterans admit the atrocities but argue that they were inevitable in the heat of war. Some claim they were partly justified because North Korean agents may have been concealed among genuine civilians. They also say that the US troops, who were in disorganised retreat at the time, were pitifully unprepared. Others point out that many more Korean civilians were killed by US bombing later in the war, particularly during the saturation bombing of Pyongyang in 1952. Official war histories record that 10,000 litres of napalm and 697 tons of bombs were dropped, resulting in the deaths of almost 8,000 people. It is unclear how far the US government is willing to investigate beyond the No Gun Ri allegations. Last week Mr Caldera said that the US will not investigate every claim that there was a loss of innocent lives. \"If you begin down that path you'll never end because all war by definition is extremely violent,\" he said. But a US embassy spokesman said later that further investigation had not been ruled out. North Korea, whose own atrocities during the war are well documented, last week seized on the issue to accuse the US of a cover up. In a separate revelation, the newspaper Hankook Ilbo in Seoul has alleged that some 1,800 political prisoners held in Taejon, south of Seoul, on charges of being communist sympathisers were executed in July 1950 by South Korean military police. It also noted that North Korean troops later massacred a large number of rightwing prisoners in revenge. \"Our government is now urged to ascertain the number of prisoners, irrespective of ideology, massacred during the war and to identify them,\" the Korean Times wrote in an editorial. \"In addition, the government is called upon to reveal who was in a position to order the terrible massacres.\"",

Hours after another frozen corpse was found a stone's throw from a church, the Pope promised that 500 meals would be served to the needy every day for the rest of 2000. Homeless people are to be welcomed and fed at Rome's four main pilgrimage sites: the basilicas of St Peter, St John Lateran, St Mary Major and St Paul Outside the Walls. \"It is a tangible sign of solidarity from the holy father to help our brothers in need,\" said Archbishop Crescenzio Sepe, head of the church's jubilee committee. It was not clear whether the food would be served inside, or in front of, the basilicas. The news was welcomed by homeless charities but Aldo Morrone, in charge of a walk-in clinic at the San Gallicano hospital, warned that the jubilee - which is expected to draw 23m pilgrims to Rome - was attracting more vagrants without a corresponding increase in resources. Rome has fewer than 800 beds for a homeless population estimated at between 1,800 and 4,000. It is thought that around 60,000 people are homeless across the country. Most of the seven vagrants to have died have been foreigners. The latest victim was a Tunisian, Ben Chaar Zouhaier, 50, who was found frozen to death on Sunday in the fashionable district of Trastevere. On Saturday a man in his 30s died in an upper class suburb beside the Vatican. The sub-zero temperatures have claimed two Polish men and, on January 3, a Swiss woman in her 60s was found in a doorway off Via della Conciliazione, the boulevard leading to St Peter's square and the Vatican boundary. Outrage and shock at the deaths has been threatening to turn public opinion against the Vatican, which has spent millions of pounds on facilities for holy year pilgrims. During today's jubilee ceremony, more than 20 non-Catholic representatives, including the Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, will join the Vatican in promoting closer relations among Christian denominations.",

Late last night Helmut Kohl's former interior minister resigned his seat in parliament, the first victim of the Christian Democrats' growing campaign funding scandal. Christian Democrat spokesman Christian Schnee said Manfred Kanther had decided to give up his parliament seat. Amid a chorus of calls for resignations of Christian Democratic Union (CDU) leaders, Mr Kanther has been under pressure since admitting on Friday that he funnelled millions to the party's coffers in Hesse state from a Swiss account and falsely reported the money as bequests. Mr Kanther, 60, ran the party apparatus in Hesse for most of the 1990s and joined Mr Kohl's government as a tough law-and-order advocate. The conservatives' leader, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, has so far held out against a barrage of demands for his resignation, but it was clear that his future would be under discussion. Reports last night said that at least one party baron who has admitted being involved in the scandal will be told to go. The latest revelations in the scandal, touched off by the former chancellor Helmut Kohl, focused on Hesse, where former party officials admitted at the weekend that they had channelled millions of marks into the party's treasury from a Swiss bank account. In a sick twist, the regional party treasurer concealed the source of the funds by saying that the donations were from grateful Holocaust survivors with accounts in offshore tax-havens.

So to do my bit to stop Livingstone, I submit this confession.</p> <p>I confess that I was a GLC councillor. Mea culpa , I was Ken Livingstone's deputy. Mea maxima culpa, I was also the chair of the GLC's finance committee. So it was me who was responsible for delivering the resources to fund Livingstone's lunatic environmental policies, like reducing bus and tube fares, letting pensioners ride free on public transport, investing to modernise the London fire brigade and completing the construction of the Thames Barrier.</p> <p>Because I established the GLC's grants policy programme, it was also me who gave the grants to black, lesbian and gay, and women's groups. I did so because that swine Livingstone insisted that we did not discriminate on grounds of race, gender, age, disability, religion or sexual orientation in the distribution of the GLC's resources.</p> <p>Deviously he implicated all of us in his plans by creating a team of chairs of committees and giving them responsibility for implementing the detailed election manifesto upon which we were elected. Coordinating this team he perfidiously supported Paul Boateng in developing ultra-left policies demanding the setting up a police authority for London to tackle issues such as police accountability and racism in the Met.</p> <p>The way he allowed Tony Banks the opportunity to make his name by pumping money into arts and sports in the capital was clearly, with hindsight, just setting Tony up to lead future campaigns to bring the World Cup and the Olympics to Britain. How cruel can you get?</p> <p>The result of the GLC's political deviance was that, at a time when Labour was meant to be losing out electorally and thus preparing the ground for the emergence of New Labour, the Labour party in London was polling consistently 10-20% ahead of Labour nationally. But this just shows that you can't even rely on Livingstone to conform to the rewriting of the history of the period. He is just uncontrollable.</p> <p>The worst thing about him, though, is that he shares with Frank Dobson a sincerity and personal kindness rare among politicians, which makes it really difficult to launch and sustain any credible personal attacks.</p> <p>Maybe it would be best if the next month was spent on simply debating policies rather than personality. Most rank and file members of the Labour party in London fear that if the coming weeks turn out to be a litany of more abuse against Livingstone, whoever is the victor, it won't be the Labour party.</p> <p>John McDonnell is Labour MP for Hayes and Harlington.</p>",

I confess that I was a GLC councillor. Mea culpa , I was Ken Livingstone's deputy. Mea maxima culpa, I was also the chair of the GLC's finance committee. So it was me who was responsible for delivering the resources to fund Livingstone's lunatic environmental policies, like reducing bus and tube fares, letting pensioners ride free on public transport, investing to modernise the London fire brigade and completing the construction of the Thames Barrier. Because I established the GLC's grants policy programme, it was also me who gave the grants to black, lesbian and gay, and women's groups. I did so because that swine Livingstone insisted that we did not discriminate on grounds of race, gender, age, disability, religion or sexual orientation in the distribution of the GLC's resources. Deviously he implicated all of us in his plans by creating a team of chairs of committees and giving them responsibility for implementing the detailed election manifesto upon which we were elected. Coordinating this team he perfidiously supported Paul Boateng in developing ultra-left policies demanding the setting up a police authority for London to tackle issues such as police accountability and racism in the Met. The way he allowed Tony Banks the opportunity to make his name by pumping money into arts and sports in the capital was clearly, with hindsight, just setting Tony up to lead future campaigns to bring the World Cup and the Olympics to Britain. How cruel can you get? The result of the GLC's political deviance was that, at a time when Labour was meant to be losing out electorally and thus preparing the ground for the emergence of New Labour, the Labour party in London was polling consistently 10-20% ahead of Labour nationally. But this just shows that you can't even rely on Livingstone to conform to the rewriting of the history of the period. He is just uncontrollable. The worst thing about him, though, is that he shares with Frank Dobson a sincerity and personal kindness rare among politicians, which makes it really difficult to launch and sustain any credible personal attacks. Maybe it would be best if the next month was spent on simply debating policies rather than personality. Most rank and file members of the Labour party in London fear that if the coming weeks turn out to be a litany of more abuse against Livingstone, whoever is the victor, it won't be the Labour party. John McDonnell is Labour MP for Hayes and Harlington.",

      "body": "<p>So finally, after 22 months of inaction, we get the money shot. Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham are injecting some pride into UK plc, coming together to create the world's biggest drugs combine. Look, we're actually top at something and it's emphatically not second division stuff. </p> <p>Yet the market's limp reaction yesterday suggests this particular deal is not wowing the viewing public in quite the way all the pre-publicity promised. Maybe too much of the plot was known in advance, but the fact is when this deal was eventually signed over the weekend the new Glaxo SmithKline ranked as Britain's largest company, while by yesterday evening it had slipped back to third position (behind Vodafone and BP Amoco), worth \u00a3107bn. </p> <p>These are still exceptionally large numbers, and yet it is almost impossible to resist the thought that the delay in putting these ideal marriage partners together was caused simply by the super egos among the two companies' boardrooms. </p> <p>In the industry itself, the competitive backdrop has certainly intensified and the readiness of rival Pfizer to mount a hostile bid for Warner-Lambert gives an indication of how rapidly the temperature is rising. In the past couple of years alone about a half of the world's 25 largest drug players have been involved in corporate activity. </p> <p>But this is not new and was clearly the reality of the marketplace when SmithKline and Glaxo last tried to merge. Then, too, it was apparent that the US trend to advertise direct to patients to encourage them to demand certain prescription drugs would spread to other developed countries. </p> <p>Changes to product marketing, pressures on national healthcare budgets and shifts in the wider social and economic environment were making corporate activity in the sector impossible to resist. And advances in science and technology were already opening the way, not only for new treatments but for an entirely new way of looking at the whole business of prophylaxis. </p> <p>The only substantive change has been of personality: Jan Leschly, SmithKline chief executive, recently decided to retire in April, while Sir Richard Sykes has agreed to move into a non-executive position and will possibly shuffle off into the world of academia soon. </p> <p>We should be relieved now that a deal is in place and should look forward to the potential benefits which such a drugs behemoth should shower on shareholders.

      "bodyText": "So finally, after 22 months of inaction, we get the money shot. Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham are injecting some pride into UK plc, coming together to create the world's biggest drugs combine. Look, we're actually top at something and it's emphatically not second division stuff. Yet the market's limp reaction yesterday suggests this particular deal is not wowing the viewing public in quite the way all the pre-publicity promised. Maybe too much of the plot was known in advance, but the fact is when this deal was eventually signed over the weekend the new Glaxo SmithKline ranked as Britain's largest company, while by yesterday evening it had slipped back to third position (behind Vodafone and BP Amoco), worth \u00a3107bn. These are still exceptionally large numbers, and yet it is almost impossible to resist the thought that the delay in putting these ideal marriage partners together was caused simply by the super egos among the two companies' boardrooms. In the industry itself, the competitive backdrop has certainly intensified and the readiness of rival Pfizer to mount a hostile bid for Warner-Lambert gives an indication of how rapidly the temperature is rising. In the past couple of years alone about a half of the world's 25 largest drug players have been involved in corporate activity. But this is not new and was clearly the reality of the marketplace when SmithKline and Glaxo last tried to merge. Then, too, it was apparent that the US trend to advertise direct to patients to encourage them to demand certain prescription drugs would spread to other developed countries. Changes to product marketing, pressures on national healthcare budgets and shifts in the wider social and economic environment were making corporate activity in the sector impossible to resist. And advances in science and technology were already opening the way, not only for new treatments but for an entirely new way of looking at the whole business of prophylaxis. The only substantive change has been of personality: Jan Leschly, SmithKline chief executive, recently decided to retire in April, while Sir Richard Sykes has agreed to move into a non-executive position and will possibly shuffle off into the world of academia soon. We should be relieved now that a deal is in place and should look forward to the potential benefits which such a drugs behemoth should shower on shareholders. But it is extraordinary that the personal predilections of two executives should have been allowed to stand in the way of a deal which is now being trumpeted as the saviour of Britain's science base. Awestruck four It is difficult to believe that anyone really thought the so-called Awesome Foursome, consisting of hi-fi salesman Julian Ritcher, semi-retired retailer and wannabe political heavyweight Archie Norman, property tycoon Nick Leslau and serial smaller company deal-maker Nigel Wray, were really going to pull together a \u00a312bn-plus bid for Marks and Spencer. When they floated Knutsford, their corporate cash shell, it was valued at \u00a35m -just the latest in a string of little shell companies put together by Manchester United director Michael Edelson, each of which has been named after a Cheshire village.

All of a sudden the quartet were running a company worth almost \u00a31bn (once options were taken into account) and the backward logic of the markets insisted that in order to \"justify\" this valuation - imposed by outsiders - Archie et al would have to pull off a big one. Knutsford should have done more to dampen this exuberance, but now it appears to be letting its excitable shareholders down slowly, unveiling a rather more digestible plan to take over Wassall and then, at the same time, promising further deals in the pipeline. As for poor Marks &amp; Spencer, with Tesco making it pretty clear yesterday that it would much prefer to concentrate on developing a global presence (and therefore securing its future) rather than getting bogged down rescuing an old-fashioned fixture of the British high street, speculative investors appear to be left with little other than the putative bid plans of one Monaco resident Philip Green.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The BBC's fascinating, problematic Kurt Weill weekend of concerts, films and talks at the Barbican ended where it began - with sexual intrigue and erotic shenanigans played out between quartets of feuding lovers. Der Protagonist - Weill's first opera, premiered in Dresden in 1926 - is about an actor who confuses illusion with reality and murders the sister he incestuously fancies when the quadrangular, partner-swapping drama in which he is acting runs hideously out of control. The Firebrand of Florence (New York, 1944) exposes the sculptor Benvenuto Cellini and his self-assured, if ditsy girlfriend Angela to the machinations of the philandering Duke of Florence and his alienated, sex-starved duchess. </p> <p>Whatever their inherent quality, both works confound expectations and are, to some extent, out on an artistic limb. Given its subject matter, one expects Der Protagonist to be an expressionistic scream-out, but its hysteria is shot through with whiffs of cool irony and edgy humour. Firebrand, hampered by a less than perfect Ira Gershwin text, aspires in places to a density and weight for which the Broadway musical wasn't ready. Both works have something else in common - they've slipped from view behind our abiding fascination with Weill's collaboration with Brecht, behind the image of Weill as the composer who defined the world of the Weimar republic. </p> <p>The image stuck in Weill's lifetime and remains unshakeable. It led to tension during his collaboration with Fritz Lang on the 1938 film You and Me. Weill wanted assimilation and acceptance in America; Lang filmed a tribute to the Berlin years. </p> <p>The only event during the weekend that was, significantly, packed to the rafters was Ute Lemper's late-night cabaret concert with the Matrix Ensemble and Robert Ziegler. Shedding a black velvet coat part-way through to mutate into a spangled deco diva, Lemper belted her way through a catalogue of Weill's best-known numbers, while a divinely decadent-looking audience yelled its head off. </p> <p>Elsewhere, the weekend was a journey through the unknown, the lost, the abandoned Weill, with variable results. The 1927 one-acter Royal Palace, with a text by the surrealist poet Iwan Goll, proved to be a genuine lost masterpiece. A feminist tragi-comedy, it focuses on the figure of Dejanira (named after the mythic wife of Hercules), who rejects the selfishness of past, present and future lovers before teasingly transforming herself into a mermaid, a siren who will return to haunt the men who have abused her. The score, full of poised waltzes and ending with one of the best tangos ever written, is to die for - and it got a performance to match, glowingly conducted by Andrew Davis, with a radiant Janice Watson triumphant in the title role. It took everyone by surprise and deflected attention from the two events that were clearly planned as the weekend's main events: the unearthing of Firebrand and the resurrection of the 1934 operetta Der Kuhhandel. </p> <p>The latter, which received a botched premiere in English at London's Savoy theatre, is one of Weill's weakest scores. He took Offenbach as his model, but where Offenbach is concise, Weill sprawls. Every number is at least one verse too long, dangerously blunting its grim arms-race satire, which neither a brilliant new translation by Jeremy Sams nor a punchy performance under Robert Ziegler could quite disguise. Firebrand, despite the presence of the amazing Rodney Gilfry - every inch the \"famous stud\" of the libretto - is a better score, though it's uneven and one wonders why it was chosen to represent Weill's Broadway years when the infinitely superior One Touch of Venus (written for Marlene Dietrich, though she never performed it) remains undiscovered by British audiences. </p> <p>The Brecht collaboration was represented by two works more talked about than performed, the harrowing Berlin Requiem (composed for the 10th anniversary of the assassination of Rosa Luxemburg) and Das Lindberghflug, a nailbiting adventure story about the famous first flight across the Atlantic. Both were sung with considerable ferocity by the BBC Symphony Chorus, while the excellent Thomas Randle was an eloquent Lindbergh who mourned \"Red Rosa's\" demise with heartfelt grief. Both works should be restored to the mainstream repertoire as soon as possible.Like Royal Palace, they belong there.</p>",

It's January, the season is more than half complete and a dozen clubs are either in relegation trouble or (when measured against expectations and/or the money spent pre-season on new players) can said to be having a bad time. Fans are malcontent, club chairmen are twitchy - so what's new you say - but look closer and you'll find there's something missing. Still don't know?

Barclays, in the face of legal action from Nationwide, has yet to introduce the charge. It threatened to change the dynamics of Link, which had previously been offered free or worked on the basis of \"disloyalty\" fees levied by financial firms on their customers when they used others' machines. Barclays has scrapped its disloyalty fee at a cost of \u00a32m a month, and wants to recoup some of this via the surcharge on other banks' customers. Nationwide, the loudest opponent of the \u00a31 fee, yesterday produced research showing that 91% of the public do not believe they should be surcharged for withdrawing their own money.

      "body": "<p>Lara Croft, the gun-toting heroine of the bestselling Tomb Raider series of computer games, is facing her toughest assignment. </p> <p>Fears have begun to emerge that the feisty character is beginning to lose her popularity - a challenge more potent for games publisher Eidos than any number of animated villains. </p> <p>After reaching \u00a363 at the end of November the company's shares have collapsed to \u00a338.55. </p> <p>According to figures compiled for games trade magazine CTW, the fourth instalment of Ms Croft's adventures made it to the top spot in sales over Christmas. It has also been the best selling game in France and Germany. </p> <p>Investors have been more anxious, however, about sales in the US which from early numbers appear to have been disappointing. A note from Merrill Lynch last week put Tomb Raider IV at only 25th in the chart of best selling games in the weeks after launch. </p> <p>Anecdotes cited by Merrill suggest that in some US stores sales of Tomb Raider IV were 50% lower than its forerunner. </p> <p>While many hi-tech stocks began the year on the slide, with Eidos the sell-off might have been exaggerated by the speed of its ascent. In little more than 12 months the share price climbed from \u00a36 to \u00a363, inviting profit takers to cash in. </p> <p>Eidos has had other difficulties, however.

      "bodyText": "Lara Croft, the gun-toting heroine of the bestselling Tomb Raider series of computer games, is facing her toughest assignment. Fears have begun to emerge that the feisty character is beginning to lose her popularity - a challenge more potent for games publisher Eidos than any number of animated villains. After reaching \u00a363 at the end of November the company's shares have collapsed to \u00a338.55. According to figures compiled for games trade magazine CTW, the fourth instalment of Ms Croft's adventures made it to the top spot in sales over Christmas. It has also been the best selling game in France and Germany. Investors have been more anxious, however, about sales in the US which from early numbers appear to have been disappointing. A note from Merrill Lynch last week put Tomb Raider IV at only 25th in the chart of best selling games in the weeks after launch. Anecdotes cited by Merrill suggest that in some US stores sales of Tomb Raider IV were 50% lower than its forerunner. While many hi-tech stocks began the year on the slide, with Eidos the sell-off might have been exaggerated by the speed of its ascent. In little more than 12 months the share price climbed from \u00a36 to \u00a363, inviting profit takers to cash in. Eidos has had other difficulties, however. Downbeat trading statements from retailers Dixons and Electronics Boutique had a knock-on effect. Both complained of reduced margins as the price of games were discounted. \"Unit sales have been healthy across the market but the value of the market is not what had been expected be cause of some savage discounting by retailers,\" said CTW editor Ronnie Dungan. The note from Merrill Lynch and one from Warburgs recommend Eidos as a long term buy because help might be at hand for our heroine. Lara Croft comics and a movie based on the character due for release at the end of next year should renew interest in the licence. Eidos has kept control of the project by insisting on being an executive producer, aiming to avoid disastrous celluloid outings for cult characters such as Tank Girl and Barb Wire. The number of Sony PlayStations and therefore the potential market for Tomb Raider has also continued to grow strongly, aided by the fall in console prices from \u00a3300 to \u00a380. Since the release of Tomb Raider III the installed base has swollen from 40m to 70m worldwide. Analysts say the market, awaiting the arrival of PlayStation II at the end of this year, has dipped slightly but maintained growth, suggesting the market has matured beyond a cyclical pattern. Longer term, as Warburg points out and many noted in the aftermath of the blockbusting America Online/Time Warner deal, those companies which can provide sought-after content are in a powerful position. \"The emergence of electronic distribution as broadband technology is introduced will expose gaming to the mass market,\" said Warburg analyst Kean Marden. Interactive television services, the internet and, potentially the most explosive growth platform, internet-enabled mobile phones, could attract new players to Tomb Raider and Eidos's other properties. Games are also expected to benefit from the growth of e-commerce. \"It may be difficult to keep rolling Lara Croft out into new adventures and maintain momentum but there is a lot of scope for moving the game sideways into other formats,\" Mr Dungan added. Eidos has invested to ensure it shares in the growth of new distribution methods. Other franchises are being developed, too, including football game Championship Manager which was the fourth best seller in Britain over Christmas. Industry pundits also like the Commandoes game and Eidos has the contract to produce a game tied to Disney's forthcoming 102 Dalmations.",

      "body": "<p> I can hear muffled whoops, squeals, the pop of bursting balloons coming from inside the room. It's party time. I blunder in, assailed by whiteness and the sensation of being suddenly lost, wading through balloons, my hair frizzing in the static charge, the tart, sweet, rubbery smell assaulting my nose, catching in the back of my throat, the balloons jostling and seething and doing a wobbly dance around me and over my head. I barge through, my body displacing these hundreds of white balloons and causing them to ride up into the clear air above. They squeak and rub together, snag my clothing and occasionally burst underfoot. Some float up to the ceiling and stick there, or rank themselves into neat grids high against the wall. Somewhere at the far end of the room is another door, if I can only get to it. </p> <p>Being in here is fun, but purposeless. You don't feel entirely adult. A sculptor like Richard Serra might make you aware of the mass and volume of space, and of your own body in relation to it, but he has to threaten you with tons of steel and the possibility of being crushed to death in order to do it. Martin Creed makes you aware of space and volume too, but he does it with balloons. </p> <p>This is Work #200, Half the Air in a Given Space, currently filling (or rather half-filling) a room at Southampton City Art Gallery as part of a survey of Creed's work. \"Choose a space,\" says the artist's note. \"Calculate the volume of the space. Using air, blow up white, 12-inch balloons until they occupy half the volume of the space... As usual the space should be full of air, but half of it should be inside balloons. Extra balloons may be added over time to maintain the volume of the work, or else the balloons may be left to deflate naturally.\" </p> <p>It is a good wheeze, but what, if anything, does it signify? It gives pleasure. The gallery is in a building that also houses a court, a library and council offices. Glum-looking local government officials sneak out of their open-plan dens and into Creed's room full of balloons, to emerge refreshed and tousled. Perhaps every office should have a room like this. </p> <p>Creed is a specialist in nothing. He has nothing to say, and that's what he goes on saying, over and over. One of his CDs, recorded with his band Owada (named after the trio's Japanese bass player), is even called Nothing, and the title track repeats the word, over and over, during five minutes of angular drum'n'bass and jangly lead guitar. </p> <p>Owada are about as stripped down as minimal art-pop gets. Their music lingers in your head but leaves you with little more than a syncopated sense of nothing. But it is intelligent nothing. Creed's work isn't about the ponderous nothingness of the void, the terror of the meta-physical zilch, or the hideous ennui of existential nada . It is just, well, nothing. Or, more accurately, something and nothing, like the froth on a cappuccino, or like a room with the lights going on and off (Work #127), or like a torn-up sheet of paper. It's there and it's not there, it's formal and it's formless. It's like trying to catch smoke. </p> <p>On my way out of the room, some of the balloons make a sneaky escape with me, bouncing and slithering their way across a gallery crammed with sculpture. They bat around an early Bill Woodrow, almost impale themselves on a Richard Deacon and do a header off a Degas bronze. Work #128: All the Sculpture in a Collection. Creed has shunted almost the entire sculpture collection of Southampton City Art Gallery into one room, from Rodin's Eve to a ghastly study of the late Max Wall. There they all are, dozens upon dozens of museum purchases, bequests, gifts and mistakes. Of course, the sculpture looks pitiful displayed like this, but I guess that's the point. The only work that's missing is the collection's Richard Long, a floor piece consisting of dozens of chalky flint lumps. </p> <p>Long's work, displayed elsewhere in the museum, isn't so far conceptually from Creed's. Both frequently use commonplace or found materials that are transformed by the artist's attention to them - by an act of ordering and display, rather than by carving or modelling. But while Long's work is evocative of nature (the Long walk, the circle of sub-arctic driftwood, a line of pebbles or a splash of mud), Creed's is essentially urban, interior, even desk-bound. </p> <p>Hang on a minute ( sounds of frenzied scrabbling and cursing as writer bangs head on underside of desk and stabs himself with dead ballpoint pen in search for crumpled notes, which he has earlier scrunched into a ball and tossed in the rubbish basket ): I might have chucked out a work of art. A few years ago, Creed mailed out \"a sheet of A4 paper crumpled into a ball\", his Work #88. Here it is again, under perspex and on a plinth. And, similarly displayed, his sheet of torn-up A4 paper, looking wan and futile in its perfect vitrine, under the glare of the gallery lights. Now this really is nearly nothing, but formally and conceptually it isn't so far from Long's chunks of flint. Both cast nice shadows, both rely on the niceties of presentation to transform them from the commonplace. </p> <p>What's the point, you ask? Look to Creed's dictum: \"The whole world + the work = the whole world\". This statement was briefly emblazoned on a huge billboard on Farringdon Road, opposite the Guardian office, as part of the ad campaign for Matthew Collings's This Is Modern Art TV series. I would stand, smoking and musing, gazing across the street at this phrase, taking a break from the day's yard of art crit. Creed's statement isn't exactly Wittgenstein, but Wittgenstein had no sense of humour. </p> <p> Creed's works accrue into an attitude rather than an oeuvre of meaningful objects; his project is a stance rather than a production line of sleek art works. It manifests itself in small, apparently trivial gestures: \"a row of 39 metronomes beating time, one at every speed\", a blob of Blu-Tack pressed on to the wall, a small typed statement that reads \"oh no\", or \"something on the left, just as you come in, not too high or low\". When he makes things that are more crafted they fall flat. His protrusions from a wall - disconcertingly pregnant-looking or breast-like bulges painted the same white as the wall itself - are too like Anish Kapoor's 1992 work When I Am Pregnant. </p> <p>The work I like best, that leaves me with more than a little jolt and a wry smile, is \"a door opening and closing and a light going on and off\", installed here in a little office in a vestibule at the beginning of the show. The door opens, the light comes on, the light goes off and the door closes. Then it does it again. There is a glimpse of filing cabinets and in-trays, suddenly illuminated. There's no one there, but I feel a little uneasy. DON'T WORRY, reads a new neon sign work. Another reads THINGS, in virulent red light. Things? What things? Creed's neon works stop you in your tracks. That's all they do. They're feel-good signs, but they're also slightly unhinged. EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE ALRIGHT says the sign he placed, to the initial bemusement of the locals, on some abandoned arches in east London. If only. </p> <p>This sign also hangs on Times Square in New York. I like the idea of its presence there among the wretched advertising slogans. Like Lawrence Weiner's mural statements, Creed's work has a benign accessibility. Weiner, you might say, got there first, and cares a great deal about whether what he does is art. I don't think Creed cares about that so much. He wants to give us pleasure, while Weiner can be irritating and drearily obtuse. Creed never forgets that there has to be a viewer, a listener or a reader, someone out there to sustain the work. The way he works looks simple, but it's hard to do and harder still to sustain. He's interrupting the daily grind, making us pause for a moment. It's nearly nothing, but it's almost enough. </p> <p>\u0095 Martin Creed Works is at Southampton City Art Gallery (01703 832743) till March 26, then touring.</p>",

But the price of finding another blockbuster such as Glaxo Welcome's anti-herpes treatment Zovirax now can cost $500m.</p> <p>Industry leaders are convinced that bigger is better and this applies as much to R&amp;D budgets as it does to getting the drug to market via ever-larger sales forces.</p> <p>This has triggered an unprecedented period of consolidation with up to half of the top 25 industry leaders involved in some kind of corporate tie-up over the past 24 months. Accountant PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates that $133bn worth of M&amp;A deals were concluded in 1999.</p> <p>Among those opting for consolidation are US group Pfizer by trying to take over rival Warner-Lambert and Monsanto which wants a deal with Pharmacia and Upjohn while, in Europe, Hoechst of Germany is joining forces with Rhone-Poulenc of France to create Aventis and Astra of Sweden merged with Zeneca of Britain. In smaller deals, Roche of Switzerland is spinning off its fragrances and flavours division into a separate company, Givaudan, while AstraZeneca and Novartis have decided to spin off their agrochemical divisions to form Syngenta.</p> <p>Takeovers and mergers are seen by some as a quick way to cut costs by rationalising overlapping activities but also offer the opportunity to increase resources for R&amp;D. Not everyone is convinced that mergers are the way to success. Critics believe that profits can be boosted in the short term but say it is no substitute for original research for new products.</p> <p>But the industry giants are not just marrying each other. Many of the new R&amp;D breakthroughs are in the biotechnology field and smaller biotech companies are being hunted and bought up by big drug companies. Much of the corporate consolidation has been in Europe where local companies are trying to increase their firepower in an effort to be more effective in the vital North American market.</p> <p>The corporate research boutique Evaluate notes how European companies have fallen behind those in the US where in the past 10 years firms' share of the top selling 50 drugs has increased from 19 in 1988 to 32 in 1998. By 2002 20 of the top 25 selling drugs will be marketed by US-based firms.</p> <p>This would be a major blow, not only to European drug industry bosses, but also to investors and governments who see the pharmaceutical sector as one in which Europe can compete with the world's best. The pressure on European companies will intensify as \"patient empowerment\" - the trend to advertise drugs directly to individuals in the hope they will demand their doctors prescribe a certain product - spreads from the US.</p> <p>Jonathan de Pass managing director of Evaluate says: \"With the advantage of the industry's most profitable products, US companies will be able to outspend their European peers. The trends highlight the pressure on European companies to consider more mergers.\"</p> <p>Analysts at merchant bank, CSFB, say that pharmaceutical companies have had to come to terms with the fact that their operating environment has changed over the last decade. \"The playing field used to be flat and R&amp;D successes were largely based on luck. But now more cash means more products at a time when there have been huge breakthroughs in all sorts of areas such as genetics, rational drug design and combinatorial chemistry,\" said one. He believes investors have been looking at the internet but the real breakthroughs have been in biology.</p>",

But the price of finding another blockbuster such as Glaxo Welcome's anti-herpes treatment Zovirax now can cost $500m. Industry leaders are convinced that bigger is better and this applies as much to R&amp;D budgets as it does to getting the drug to market via ever-larger sales forces. This has triggered an unprecedented period of consolidation with up to half of the top 25 industry leaders involved in some kind of corporate tie-up over the past 24 months. Accountant PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates that $133bn worth of M&amp;A deals were concluded in 1999. Among those opting for consolidation are US group Pfizer by trying to take over rival Warner-Lambert and Monsanto which wants a deal with Pharmacia and Upjohn while, in Europe, Hoechst of Germany is joining forces with Rhone-Poulenc of France to create Aventis and Astra of Sweden merged with Zeneca of Britain. In smaller deals, Roche of Switzerland is spinning off its fragrances and flavours division into a separate company, Givaudan, while AstraZeneca and Novartis have decided to spin off their agrochemical divisions to form Syngenta. Takeovers and mergers are seen by some as a quick way to cut costs by rationalising overlapping activities but also offer the opportunity to increase resources for R&amp;D. Not everyone is convinced that mergers are the way to success. Critics believe that profits can be boosted in the short term but say it is no substitute for original research for new products. But the industry giants are not just marrying each other. Many of the new R&amp;D breakthroughs are in the biotechnology field and smaller biotech companies are being hunted and bought up by big drug companies. Much of the corporate consolidation has been in Europe where local companies are trying to increase their firepower in an effort to be more effective in the vital North American market. The corporate research boutique Evaluate notes how European companies have fallen behind those in the US where in the past 10 years firms' share of the top selling 50 drugs has increased from 19 in 1988 to 32 in 1998. By 2002 20 of the top 25 selling drugs will be marketed by US-based firms. This would be a major blow, not only to European drug industry bosses, but also to investors and governments who see the pharmaceutical sector as one in which Europe can compete with the world's best. The pressure on European companies will intensify as \"patient empowerment\" - the trend to advertise drugs directly to individuals in the hope they will demand their doctors prescribe a certain product - spreads from the US. Jonathan de Pass managing director of Evaluate says: \"With the advantage of the industry's most profitable products, US companies will be able to outspend their European peers. The trends highlight the pressure on European companies to consider more mergers.\" Analysts at merchant bank, CSFB, say that pharmaceutical companies have had to come to terms with the fact that their operating environment has changed over the last decade. \"The playing field used to be flat and R&amp;D successes were largely based on luck. But now more cash means more products at a time when there have been huge breakthroughs in all sorts of areas such as genetics, rational drug design and combinatorial chemistry,\" said one. He believes investors have been looking at the internet but the real breakthroughs have been in biology.",
