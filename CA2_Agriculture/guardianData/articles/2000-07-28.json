She puts out her own records, happily admits that her goal is to make people cry and when she performs she fulfils all the criteria of a perfect live show. She sings and plays beautifully, laughing at herself on the one occasion when her fingers flutter on her acoustic guitar strings. She smiles admiringly as her friend Laura Reid enriches each song with her exquisite cello lines and grins when the drummer pulls out a box of Tate &amp; Lyle sugar to recreate the shuffling rhythm on Lydia. She seems nervous and embarrassed by the cheers that greet each song and yet, unlike so many other performers, she overcomes this enough to chat amiably with her obviously devoted fans. </p> <p>She is sweet, charming - nice, reckons the girl sitting next to me. But this isn't enough. There are hints of darkness in Williams's lyrics: \"I'm sinking down,\" she muses on Madmen and Maniacs, from last year's debut album Dog Leap Stairs. \"Is your life so exciting you have to tell everyone you meet?\" she snidely comments on Soul to Feet, from the Mercury-approved Little Black Numbers. But there's very little darkness in her style. There's no reeling, no unravelling, no stabs at the heart. Nothing volatile. Without that, these songs feel one-dimensional. Williams's gorgeous, ethereal voice floats along a silky, creamy surface, never tearing through to rawer emotions beneath. </p> <p>The best song she plays in the set, You Tell the Truth As If It Were Lies, hints at how powerful she could be if she let a few devils mingle with her angels. Dedicated to someone she doesn't like, its indigo melodies and assertive cello almost pack a punch. But for the most part, you're carried along in a haze of loveliness that is pleasant but uninvolving. It is admirable that Williams has a style that feels utterly idiosyncratic, but watching her is a safe experience, in a way that watching PJ Harvey, for example, or Cat Power, would never be. But then, it's exactly that element of blandness that makes her a top tip for the Mercury - whatever William Hill think. </p>",

He's a computer programmer for a Banbury-based games company, earns between \u00a330-\u00a340,000 and has been with the same bank for 12 years.

The same happened when he tried to get a credit card from Bank One, now part of the Halifax group. Again, they refused to tell him why. </p> <p>Like many people declined credit, Mr Dickinson suspected there must be a mix-up with his credit rating. He paid \u00a32 to look at his personal file held at Experian, but discovered it was blemish-free. He could only guess that he had been rejected not because of his credit rating, but because of the credit scoring used by the companies. </p> <p>\"The only thing I can think of is that I have changed address four times in the past three years, and I am not on the electoral register at my current address. This is most annoying as I really hate being in debt, and have always been meticulous in paying bills, debts and so on. Unfortunately I will be moving house again in a few months, so I guess that it will only get worse,\" he says. </p> <p>The wall of silence about credit scoring is what infuriated Guardian journalist Stephen Bates when he returned to Britain from a four-year stint as the newspaper's European Affairs Editor in Brussels. He wanted a loan for a home improvement, but was shocked when he was rejected by at least six companies. \"By all accounts I ought to be a credit company's dream applicant: well-paid, same employer for 10 years, mortgage for 18 years, never defaulted on a loan or delayed repayment.\" Yet he was turned down even by companies he had long used, such as Amex. Eventually Amex offered him a loan, but only after angry letters enclosing documents to prove his financial status. </p> <p>\"What I found really aggravating was the contrast between the advertising with all its promises of easy riches and the coldness of our rejection by a succession of telephone operatives ... without any chance of finding out why,\" he says. </p> <p>Like Mr Dickinson, Bates also found that his credit rating was clean. He was almost certainly rejected because his name was not on the electoral roll. The roll is compiled by local authorities in October each year and the credit reference agencies fully update the data by the following April. Bates moved in to his home in December 1999, and won't go on to the electoral roll until later this year - so he is likely to continue being rejected until April 2001. </p> <p>But he at least now has more right to demand why he is being rejected. A new code of conduct came into force in March this year under which lenders must tell applicants the principal cause for their rejection. </p> <p>What's more, proposals to update the electoral roll on a rolling basis should bring down the delays which have plagued applicants who move into a new home but just miss the October 10 registration deadline.</p>",

      "body": "<p>It's 7.59pm, the Coronation Street credits are rolling, and The Bill is starting in a minute or two. Traditionally the moment when viewers across the land rush to put the kettle on and make a brew. Now, growing numbers of people are instead grabbing their TV remote control, calling up their bank account on the screen and checking their balance or paying an electricity bill. </p> <p>TV banking is dramatically changing the way we manage our money _ and the relationship we have with our telly. The number of people who use their TV to do their basic banking is only just approaching six figures, but is expected to explode in the next few years as more and more banks offer this facility to their customers. </p> <p>HSBC was the first bank to launch a nationally available digital TV banking service. Available via Open, the interactive TV channel on Sky Digital, it was launched 10 months ago but has been fully interactive only since April. It now has more than 90,000 customers. </p> <p>They are able to keep track of their spending and savings, pay bills, transfer money between their bank and savings accounts, and view their standing orders and direct debits. </p> <p>On Monday HSBC proudly announced that the service was used to check a balance for the one millionth time. </p> <p>However, it now has its first serious competition in the form of Abbey National, which this week launched its own digital TV banking service, again available via Open, which means you have to have a Sky Digital set-top box to use it. </p> <p>Abbey claims its service is \"the most advanced\" available, and it is being offered to any customer with a card-based current or savings account who registers. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the Woolwich has revealed its service will be up and running within a couple of months and First Direct is hot on its tail. </p> <p>While most banks have been concentrating on enabling their customers to manage their finances online via a PC, some experts reckon it is TV banking that will eventually become the main method of banking from home. </p> <p>Only one in four households has a PC, while there is a TV in 98% of homes and the take-up of digital televi sion is growing rapidly. </p> <p>Ambrose McGinn at Abbey National says that many people find PCs too complicated and are concerned about the technology. When it comes to their TV, however, \"people have been using it for years, they are comfortable with using remote control handsets\". </p> <p>Cable companies and pay TV operators such as Telewest and ONdigital have also been getting in on the act, and a recent survey from market analysts Datamonitor predicted that the number of people across Europe doing their banking via their TV is likely to increase ten-fold over the next four years - from 570,000 this year to 6.1m in 2004. </p> <p>Using your television to access your bank account couldn't be easier, say Abbey and HSBC. You don't need a separate keypad - you simply use your remote control to key in your passcode and move around the site. </p> <p>The downside is that, unlike banking by PC, you cannot download or print information. </p> <p>Abbey's service allows people to view their account balances and recent transactions in \"real time\", move money instantly between their bank and savings accounts, pay bills, set up, amend and cancel standing orders and regular payments, and request and amend overdraft facilities. </p> <p>The banks dabbling in TV banking say these sort of services will allow people to do more with their sets than simply watch their favourite programmes, and offer a lifeline to people who cannot afford PCs. But not everyone is convinced that tuning into the internet via your telly will leave the computer redundant. </p> <p>Writing in the latest edition of Open's newsletter, Paul Davies, executive editor of trade magazine New Media Markets, points out that while logging on to the net on your computer tends to be something of a solitary activity, the TV is very much a \"social\" medium. \"It seems likely that one side-effect of all this will be family rows, not just about which channel to watch but about whether a family member can surf the net when others want to watch Coronation Street,\" he says. </p> <p>Unfazed, Abbey has said its aim is to \"dominate\" the TV banking market. To this end, as well as linking up with Sky Digital, it has entered into partnerships with several other key players. It already has an information-only service up and running with Telewest and has signed deals with two other cable companies, NTL and Cable &amp; Wireless, plus ONdigital. </p> <p>The Woolwich will launch its TV banking service - yet again available via Open - within the next six or seven weeks. It will be available to customers of its Open Plan product range, and while details have yet to be finalised, it is likely to allow people to view the balance or value of any Woolwich account including savings, mortgages, unit trusts and Isas, move money between accounts, pay bills and check recent transactions. </p> <p>Of the other high street banks, Barclays is currently undertaking trials with Cable &amp; Wireless, though these only involve the provision of information about its products and services. Barclays says: \"We want to explore customer demand before taking it any further.\" </p> <p>Lloyds TSB also appears to have a service in the offing - it would only say, somewhat mysteriously, that it \"expects to have a partnership by the end of the year\". Meanwhile, NatWest says it doesn't have any plans for TV banking. </p>",

However, it now has its first serious competition in the form of Abbey National, which this week launched its own digital TV banking service, again available via Open, which means you have to have a Sky Digital set-top box to use it. Abbey claims its service is \"the most advanced\" available, and it is being offered to any customer with a card-based current or savings account who registers. Meanwhile, the Woolwich has revealed its service will be up and running within a couple of months and First Direct is hot on its tail. While most banks have been concentrating on enabling their customers to manage their finances online via a PC, some experts reckon it is TV banking that will eventually become the main method of banking from home. Only one in four households has a PC, while there is a TV in 98% of homes and the take-up of digital televi sion is growing rapidly. Ambrose McGinn at Abbey National says that many people find PCs too complicated and are concerned about the technology. When it comes to their TV, however, \"people have been using it for years, they are comfortable with using remote control handsets\". Cable companies and pay TV operators such as Telewest and ONdigital have also been getting in on the act, and a recent survey from market analysts Datamonitor predicted that the number of people across Europe doing their banking via their TV is likely to increase ten-fold over the next four years - from 570,000 this year to 6.1m in 2004. Using your television to access your bank account couldn't be easier, say Abbey and HSBC. You don't need a separate keypad - you simply use your remote control to key in your passcode and move around the site. The downside is that, unlike banking by PC, you cannot download or print information. Abbey's service allows people to view their account balances and recent transactions in \"real time\", move money instantly between their bank and savings accounts, pay bills, set up, amend and cancel standing orders and regular payments, and request and amend overdraft facilities. The banks dabbling in TV banking say these sort of services will allow people to do more with their sets than simply watch their favourite programmes, and offer a lifeline to people who cannot afford PCs. But not everyone is convinced that tuning into the internet via your telly will leave the computer redundant. Writing in the latest edition of Open's newsletter, Paul Davies, executive editor of trade magazine New Media Markets, points out that while logging on to the net on your computer tends to be something of a solitary activity, the TV is very much a \"social\" medium. \"It seems likely that one side-effect of all this will be family rows, not just about which channel to watch but about whether a family member can surf the net when others want to watch Coronation Street,\" he says. Unfazed, Abbey has said its aim is to \"dominate\" the TV banking market. To this end, as well as linking up with Sky Digital, it has entered into partnerships with several other key players. It already has an information-only service up and running with Telewest and has signed deals with two other cable companies, NTL and Cable &amp; Wireless, plus ONdigital. The Woolwich will launch its TV banking service - yet again available via Open - within the next six or seven weeks. It will be available to customers of its Open Plan product range, and while details have yet to be finalised, it is likely to allow people to view the balance or value of any Woolwich account including savings, mortgages, unit trusts and Isas, move money between accounts, pay bills and check recent transactions. Of the other high street banks, Barclays is currently undertaking trials with Cable &amp; Wireless, though these only involve the provision of information about its products and services. Barclays says: \"We want to explore customer demand before taking it any further.\" Lloyds TSB also appears to have a service in the offing - it would only say, somewhat mysteriously, that it \"expects to have a partnership by the end of the year\". Meanwhile, NatWest says it doesn't have any plans for TV banking.",

While analysts are pencilling in higher interest rates from the federal reserve and the Bank of England, the European Central Bank is expected to hold fire for the time being. </p> <p>\"Recent euro zone data, including the money supply data, have eroded the likelihood of a eurozone rate hike in September and kicked the euro while it was already down,\" said Mike Moran, treasury economist at Standard Chartered in London. </p> <p>The money supply data followed dovish comments from European Central Bank board member Vitor Constancio, who said on Thursday that the bank could tolerate temporary spikes in inflation above its 2% target. </p> <p>The euro hit troughs around 61.3 pence, its lowest level since May 25, before recovering slightly to close in London at 61.62p. Against the dollar, the euro fell as far as 92.6 cents, its lowest level since July 20, down about 2% from two week peaks around 94.5 cents set earlier this week.

      "bodyText": "British holidaymakers heading for European sun spots received a last minute boost yesterday when Europe's battered single currency tumbled on the foreign exchanges, writes Charlotte Denny. The euro fell to a two month low against the pound, pushing down the prices for British tourists in the continent's main holiday destinations of Spain, France and Italy. The single currency also fell against the dollar, hitting one week lows. Expectations that the gap between borrowing costs on the continent and in Britain and the United States will continue to widen were behind yesterday's currency gyrations. While analysts are pencilling in higher interest rates from the federal reserve and the Bank of England, the European Central Bank is expected to hold fire for the time being. \"Recent euro zone data, including the money supply data, have eroded the likelihood of a eurozone rate hike in September and kicked the euro while it was already down,\" said Mike Moran, treasury economist at Standard Chartered in London. The money supply data followed dovish comments from European Central Bank board member Vitor Constancio, who said on Thursday that the bank could tolerate temporary spikes in inflation above its 2% target. The euro hit troughs around 61.3 pence, its lowest level since May 25, before recovering slightly to close in London at 61.62p. Against the dollar, the euro fell as far as 92.6 cents, its lowest level since July 20, down about 2% from two week peaks around 94.5 cents set earlier this week. It closed yesterday in London at 92.7 cents.",

The question Williams poses is whether that can best be achieved by herself; her boozy, spiritualist half-sister Bernice; or by her life-loving daughter Janet. </p> <p>Williams's main point is that the post-Windrush generation which looked to Britain to fulfil its dreams paid a heavy emotional price. Heather emerges as a cold woman who disapproved of her son's desire to form a rock band as much as she does of her daughter's cohabitation with a restaurant-owning boyfriend. If Williams sees any hope it is in the daughter who manages to combine a relaxed, hedonistic London lifestyle with an intuitive awareness of her antecedents and a life beyond the grave. </p> <p>I am uneasy at the way Williams plays on the associations of the Lawrence case without exploring any specifics. But he successfully evokes both the ramshackle poverty of Jamaica and its strange sunlit spirituality: you see both why many people felt they had to leave and why they are glad to return. Annie Castledine's production, with Timothy Sutton's almost continuous piano music and designer Liz Cooke's economic evocation of a magic forest, is also potently atmospheric. </p> <p>All the performances - Doreene Blackstock as Heather, Jax Williams as her mini-skirted daughter, Claire Benedict as her otherworldly half-sister and Nicholas Beveney as Bernice's shadowy admirer - are first-rate.

The Malcolm Marshall Memorial Match attracted a crowd of more than 3,000 and raised an estimated \u00a350,000 for his son, Mali. </p> <p>The Honourable Artillery Company, where the match was played, was established under royal charter by Henry VIII in 1537 and is the oldest regiment in the British army. On state occasions such as the Queen's birthday, the regiment fires gun salutes at the Tower of London, and it would not have been inappropriate if they had boomed out again yesterday for the former West Indies fast bowler and coach, who died in November aged 41. </p> <p>Ron Atkinson, glancing at the 25-pounders on the boundary, quipped: \"Do you think they are expecting crowd trouble?\" </p> <p>Marshall's widow Connie, Mali's mother, said: \"It is a sunny, Malcolm Marshall day, a wonderful day for a wonderful man. And the fact that so many cricketers have turned out for him is a great tribute.\" </p> <p>Glenn McGrath was so keen to play that he phoned the organiser David English. \"But I've already got 47 players,\" he was told. \"Then make me the 48th,\" replied the Australia fast bowler. </p> <p>Colin Croft was miffed when he could not get a game. \"But I wanted to be here anyway. Malcolm was effervescent and one of the best performers I've seen. He was always charging in. His arm came over very quickly and he did more with it than the rest of us.\" </p> <p>Michael Holding did get a game and even gave a chilling reprise of the Oval '76 when he glided in off his full run, although this time he did not release the ball. \"It doesn't matter,\" said someone. \"I would pay good money just to see him run in. The ball doesn't matter.\" </p> <p>Joel Garner, a former Barbados and West Indies team-mate, said: \"He was a good friend; one of the best I had. We were like family. His great strength as a bowler was his ability to adapt to any conditions.\" </p> <p>Former opponents had more rueful memories. Mike Gatting, who must have thought he had faced Holding and Garner for the last time, recalled the time Marshall broke his nose in Kingston in 1986. </p> <p>\"He was just about the best fast bowler I ever saw.

      "bodyText": "A cricket match in the heart of London is bizarre enough. When there are 48 players, and no one seems sure who has won, it becomes a little surreal. It did not matter, though. The Malcolm Marshall Memorial Match attracted a crowd of more than 3,000 and raised an estimated \u00a350,000 for his son, Mali. The Honourable Artillery Company, where the match was played, was established under royal charter by Henry VIII in 1537 and is the oldest regiment in the British army. On state occasions such as the Queen's birthday, the regiment fires gun salutes at the Tower of London, and it would not have been inappropriate if they had boomed out again yesterday for the former West Indies fast bowler and coach, who died in November aged 41. Ron Atkinson, glancing at the 25-pounders on the boundary, quipped: \"Do you think they are expecting crowd trouble?\" Marshall's widow Connie, Mali's mother, said: \"It is a sunny, Malcolm Marshall day, a wonderful day for a wonderful man. And the fact that so many cricketers have turned out for him is a great tribute.\" Glenn McGrath was so keen to play that he phoned the organiser David English. \"But I've already got 47 players,\" he was told. \"Then make me the 48th,\" replied the Australia fast bowler. Colin Croft was miffed when he could not get a game. \"But I wanted to be here anyway. Malcolm was effervescent and one of the best performers I've seen. He was always charging in. His arm came over very quickly and he did more with it than the rest of us.\" Michael Holding did get a game and even gave a chilling reprise of the Oval '76 when he glided in off his full run, although this time he did not release the ball. \"It doesn't matter,\" said someone. \"I would pay good money just to see him run in. The ball doesn't matter.\" Joel Garner, a former Barbados and West Indies team-mate, said: \"He was a good friend; one of the best I had. We were like family. His great strength as a bowler was his ability to adapt to any conditions.\" Former opponents had more rueful memories. Mike Gatting, who must have thought he had faced Holding and Garner for the last time, recalled the time Marshall broke his nose in Kingston in 1986. \"He was just about the best fast bowler I ever saw. And he was such an intelligent bowler. He bowled very fast, swung it both ways, and wanted to keep the ball all day. He was a dream to captain and I just wish I had done it more than once. That was when we had the MCC bicentennial match at Lord's, and on a flat pitch he gave everyone problems.\" The Hampshire captain Robin Smith, once a team-mate at Southampton, said: \"We are all here for Mali today.

      "body": "<p>Two formats that have long dominated the cinematic imagination are the Last Caper Film and the Last Gunfight Film. In the former (The Lavender Hill Mob, Oceans 11, Assault On A Queen, the next five Burt Reynolds movies), an affable scoundrel starting to get a bit long in the tooth assembles a gang of his old cronies and tries to pull off one last big score. </p> <p>Usually, a large part of the film is devoted to the leader's desperate attempts to induce his cohorts to come out of retirement; there is invariably a disbelieving wife, a sullen girlfriend, an incredulous employer or an irate mother standing in the way. But in the end, the ringleader makes his case, and the game is afoot.</p> <p>The Last Gunfight Film (Shane, The Unforgiven, The Wild Bunch, The Patriot) usually involves an ageing gunslinger who is persuaded to emerge from retirement because of a personal obligation, a mysterious vendetta or an unusual amount of villainy at the state, county or municipal level. Frequently the hero himself has a number of personality deficiencies, but these tend to be overshadowed by the utter moral disfigurement of his adversaries. The hero is, in the words of the Immortal Bard, a man more sinned against than sinning. Though sometimes not by a very wide margin.</p> <p>Gone In 60 Seconds is a highly effective, though mildly ridiculous, hybrid of these two beloved genres. Giovanni Ribisi, who has been in so many bad movies that it was inevitable he should eventually be in a good one, plays a young, industrious car thief whose grandstanding tendencies have just landed him in hot water. Personally committed to stealing 50 cars for a psychotic Anglo-Italian mobster based in the suburbs of Los Angeles, he has totally muffed the assignment and now faces certain death.</p> <p>Ribisi, in point of fact, is doomed because his psychotic employer cannot bear the thought of not delivering the 50 vehicles to his South American customers at the stipulated time. Seemingly, it is a central tenet of the unwritten South American criminal code that stolen cars not delivered on time are worse than no stolen cars at all. Thus, if the psychotic middle-man cannot come up with the cars by 8am on Friday morning, he will be forever discredited in the eyes of his nefarious customers, and very likely forced to become a full-time woodworker, a talent that to date has only been his hobby. Like I said, the movie is mildly ridiculous.</p> <p>Into this imbroglio steps the engaging Nicolas Cage, a recently retired car thief par excellence who was, in his heyday, the Paganini of southern Californian automotive redeployment. Cage has taken early retirement at the behest of his long-suffering mother, who worries that her younger son, Ribisi, will be so envious of Cage's grand larceny skills that he will eventually go into the same line of work.

      "bodyText": "Two formats that have long dominated the cinematic imagination are the Last Caper Film and the Last Gunfight Film. In the former (The Lavender Hill Mob, Oceans 11, Assault On A Queen, the next five Burt Reynolds movies), an affable scoundrel starting to get a bit long in the tooth assembles a gang of his old cronies and tries to pull off one last big score. Usually, a large part of the film is devoted to the leader's desperate attempts to induce his cohorts to come out of retirement; there is invariably a disbelieving wife, a sullen girlfriend, an incredulous employer or an irate mother standing in the way. But in the end, the ringleader makes his case, and the game is afoot. The Last Gunfight Film (Shane, The Unforgiven, The Wild Bunch, The Patriot) usually involves an ageing gunslinger who is persuaded to emerge from retirement because of a personal obligation, a mysterious vendetta or an unusual amount of villainy at the state, county or municipal level. Frequently the hero himself has a number of personality deficiencies, but these tend to be overshadowed by the utter moral disfigurement of his adversaries. The hero is, in the words of the Immortal Bard, a man more sinned against than sinning. Though sometimes not by a very wide margin. Gone In 60 Seconds is a highly effective, though mildly ridiculous, hybrid of these two beloved genres. Giovanni Ribisi, who has been in so many bad movies that it was inevitable he should eventually be in a good one, plays a young, industrious car thief whose grandstanding tendencies have just landed him in hot water. Personally committed to stealing 50 cars for a psychotic Anglo-Italian mobster based in the suburbs of Los Angeles, he has totally muffed the assignment and now faces certain death. Ribisi, in point of fact, is doomed because his psychotic employer cannot bear the thought of not delivering the 50 vehicles to his South American customers at the stipulated time. Seemingly, it is a central tenet of the unwritten South American criminal code that stolen cars not delivered on time are worse than no stolen cars at all. Thus, if the psychotic middle-man cannot come up with the cars by 8am on Friday morning, he will be forever discredited in the eyes of his nefarious customers, and very likely forced to become a full-time woodworker, a talent that to date has only been his hobby. Like I said, the movie is mildly ridiculous. Into this imbroglio steps the engaging Nicolas Cage, a recently retired car thief par excellence who was, in his heyday, the Paganini of southern Californian automotive redeployment. Cage has taken early retirement at the behest of his long-suffering mother, who worries that her younger son, Ribisi, will be so envious of Cage's grand larceny skills that he will eventually go into the same line of work. Which he does. Now Cage learns from an old confederate, played by the serviceable Will Patton, that unless he shakes off the mothballs and steals the 50 cars within the next four days, his brother will be cruelly dispatched by a slowly descending trash compactor. Cage reluctantly agrees to steal the cars, immediately running afoul of his old nemesis Delroy Lindo, the hard-working cop who has been trying to put him in the slammer for years. A good portion of the film is now taken up by what are best described as genre compulsories: the scene where Cage tries to persuade reliable old coot Robert Duvall to serve as the sergeant-at-arms on this operation; the scene where Cage hooks up with his old flame, Angelina Jolie, who still wonders why her ex-lover bagged the car-theft game; a number of scenes where Cage goes head to head with Lindo. These stock sequences have the same seductive appeal as rock'n'roll power chords: the fact that you can see them coming from a mile away doesn't make them any less satisfactory. In fact, it makes them more so. No Last Gunfight film would be complete without the scene where the sheriff tells the gunslinger that this particular town isn't big enough for both of them. Several years ago, I wrote a story for Movieline about extremely unlikely movie heroes. These included Kevin Costner as a charming kidnapper in A Perfect World, Al Pacino as a congenial drug dealer and murderer in Carlito's Way and Jean Reno as a thoroughly loveable hit man in The Professional.

      "bodyText": "The former Tottenham Hotspur captain Gary Mabbutt is one of several former professional footballers who have been nominated to sit on a new disciplinary panel to examine video evidence of controversial incidents. The Professional Footballers' Association has written to the Football Association nominating Mabbutt along with Brian McClair, Steve Ogrizovic, John Barnes and Brian Marwood. Garth Crooks has also been nominated but his appointment could cause problems given the former Tottenham striker's involvement with Match of the Day. The FA has the right to reject any of the names and may feel that there is a conflict of interest with Crooks, particularly if he highlights an incident on Match of the Day and is then asked to adjudicate on it days later. The League Managers' Association has nominated four former managers to the FA, as has the Referees' Association. The setting up of disciplinary panels was announced by the FA on Wednesday as part of a package of stern measures to stamp out bad behaviour by players and club officials. A pool of panel members will be available to the FA but only three will sit on any one incident. The panel will only be allowed to adjudicate on incidents not seen by the referee but caught on camera, or in cases of mistaken identity. Gordon Taylor, the PFA's chief executive, said care had been taken to ensure that its nominees had good disciplinary records during their playing careers. He added: \"Obviously you would not choose a convicted criminal to sit on a jury. This is going to be football's equivalent of a jury. We are confident that the players we have nominated have the respect of their peers. There will be a better chance of justice being seen to be done when there's a more rounded view of particular incidents with the opinions of those who have played being taken on board.\" Meanwhile, the Manchester United captain Roy Keane admitted yesterday he had been \"bang out of order\" in leading a posse of players haranguing the referee Andy d'Urso last season. \"You have to hold your hands up,\" he said. \"When you're wrong, you're wrong.

English football will continue to be saturated by overseas players after the government effectively ended any hope of a quota being implemented, stating it would be \"extremely unpopular with fans and clubs\". Despite England's dismal showing in the European Championship - and the Professional Footballers' Association echoing Keegan's reservations about the lack of opportunities for home-grown talent - the department for education and employment is unwilling to pursue a change in European law that would permit such a move. Under the present system, with the Treaty of Rome implementing equality of opportunity and the free movement of labour throughout the European Union, the Football Association is powerless to impose its own quota. It has reached the point where Keegan said recently that future England coaches would have to pick most of their players from the lower divisions. Any alteration to the statute would require the unanimous agreement of every EU nation and, although the government has indicated it will contribute to any talks, it is unwilling to pursue the matter itself. \"Given that free movement of labour throughout the European Economic Area is viewed as one of the cardinal principles of the treaty, we think it unlikely that sport would be given an exemption,\" a department spokesman said yesterday.

Will the \u00a311m Sergei Rebrov, the left-sided defender Ben Thatcher and his former Wimbledon colleague Neil Sullivan make this year any different? \"We've got some way to go before we can match Manchester United's strength, but I feel far more optimistic now than I did this time last year,\" said Graham, in spite of doubts over the future of David \"Two Mercs\" Ginola. \"There's a lot of negative talk attached to this club which is unjustified. We haven't achieved what we set out to achieve, but we're a big club with big ideas. We have a stronger squad, we've shown we're prepared to spend money and there could be more new faces coming in.\" Spurs fans will have heard it all before, of course, and we'll believe future success when we see it. But if anyone can do it, George Graham can, with or without a Zimmer frame.",

It remains unclear if their current handler intends to sue. Or should that be Soo?",

So managing director Gabriele Oriali has been on the case this week trying to push through a deal, even if it involved interrupting Cov chairman Bryan Richardson's holiday. \"We are aware that Mr Richardson is on holiday,\" Oriali told a right-lurching redtop, \"but there is such a thing as a telephone.\"</p> <p>Richardson must have decided it was good to talk, because Keane appeared to be on his way out of Highfield Road today. \"Robbie came into the training ground this morning,\" a club spokesman said, \"But he left early to speak to his agent and is now going to Italy to talk with Inter Milan.\" In which case it looks like Robbie will be plying his trade at the San Siro next season, along with Ronaldo, Vieri, Sukur, Recoba, Zamorano, Mutu, Baggio, and Pirlo.

A fair deal for Chelsea? Last year they bought Deschamps for \u00a33.5m - which means they've made a not-insubstantial \u00a31.2m loss in 12 months. Not bad for a player you were reluctant to sell.

      "bodyText": "William Hague yesterday prompted a new row over race relations when he gave a job on the Tory shadow home affairs team to a rightwing MP who once advocated the voluntary repatriation of black and Asian people. In a move which was condemned by Labour and the Liberal Democrats, the former Monday Club member John Bercow was given a key slot on the frontbench working alongside Ann Widdecombe. As a rightwinger in the 1980s Mr Bercow argued for the voluntary repatriation of black and Asian people, the repeal of the Race Relations Act and the abolition of the commission for racial equality. His promotion overshadowed the appointment of Steve Norris as a Tory vice-chairman in charge of recruiting more people from Britain's ethnic minorities. His appointment was designed to appeal to voters on the centre ground who were encouraged by his moderate language on race relations during the London mayoral election. Mr Hague's new home affairs spokesman, who will have a say in the Tories' race relations policies, was secretary to the immigration and repatriation committee of the Monday Club in the early 1980s and wrote up the minutes of a committee meeting which called for voluntary repatriation. He wrote: \"It was formally agreed that the policy of the committee should be: an end to New Commonwealth and Pakistan immigration, a properly financed system of voluntary repatriation, the repeal of the Race Relations Act and the abolition of the commission for racial equality. Particular emphasis on repatriation.\" The appointment of the rightwinger was condemned last night by Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Simon Hughes, the Lib Dem home affairs spokesman, said last night: \"John Bercow's appointment to look after the civil liberties of the nation is dangerous and very worrying. A Tory home affairs team led by Ann Widdecombe and with John Bercow following behind is hardly the inheritance of the One Nation tradition.\" Mr Bercow last night stood by his comments, saying that he believed at the time that the scale of immigration was \"difficult to accommodate\". However, he insisted that he no longer supported any of the arguments outlined in his memorandum. Pointing out that he had only been a member of the Monday Club for 18 months between 1981 and 1983, Mr Bercow said that it was \"breathtaking tripe and stupid\" to link him with outdated views. \"I was a member of the Monday Club which I left many years ago,\" he said. \"Senior members of the Labour frontbench were also card-carrying members of CND until recently.\" Mr Bercow, an admirer of Enoch Powell, said that he now opposed voluntary repatriation and supported the Race Relations Act and the commission for racial equality. \"I believe that in a fair society if you start identifying volunteers to leave that can turn nasty,\" he said. Mr Norris, in his new job, will take over responsibility for the Tory culture unit, designed to reach out to members of ethnic minorities. \"Any party that wants to be seen as a truly national party has got to appeal to 100% of the population, be they straight, gay, black or white,\" he said. \"William Hague feels that I can articulate that.\" Mr Norris, who will play a central role in the Tories' general election campaign, will have to work with Tim Collins, another vice chairman, who attempted to block him standing as the Tory candidate for London mayor.",

We can all stroll forth, adorned in dignity as befits our status in life, and fashionable, too. </p> <p>But there's a big problem here that Prada seem not to have taken into account. It's to do with age, and motherliness, and all that. It's this: if a woman over, oh, 25 puts on those little suits and blouses and court heels, she looks like a middle-aged lady. If a woman verging on what used to be called middle-aged - 39 plus tax, say - puts them on, she looks like an old lady.

We have, as they say, come a long way, baby, and putting on clothing from way back when is not in our interests, sartorially, aesthetically or politically. I don't care what fashion says: if I am to look like anyone's mother, I want to look like my daughter's mother, not my own in a time warp. </p> <p>Even way back then, the only people who looked nice in those little suits were Audrey Hepburn and Ava Gardner. They were probably about 22 at the time, slender as elves, leggy, and just waiting for Cary Grant to take their specs off and say: \"Why but Miss Thing, you're beautiful!\" </p> <p> Anyone other than a beautiful, timid virgin in her first job and working for Cary Grant is not going to look good in these clothes. Anyone who has a bosom is going to look like Margaret Dumont; anyone with legs shorter than Cyd Charisse is going to look like a stylish pouffe from some taupe-obsessed modern furniture shop. </p> <p>If all my comparisons are with film stars of yesterdecade, it's completely logical. This look has not come around since then, purely and simply because on 99% of women it is not a good look. Until now, designers and their high street imitators have realised this and moved straight on through the wardrobe of history to something more profitable. But there comes a time when, in her neverending swirl through the outfits of the past, fashion could not resist picking up something patently hopeless and trying again with it.

      "bodyText": "Air France said its Concorde supersonic jets would remain grounded until further notice as the company prepared to hold its own private tribute to the crew and victims of Tuesday's crash that killed 113 people. British Airways has resumed its flights from London to New York, but the French transport minister, Jean-Claude Gayssot, said earlier this week that France didn't want to take any risks. Air France was planning a private memorial this afternoon at its headquarters at Charles de Gaulle airport, where the doomed Concorde started its short and fatal flight. The town of Gonesse, where the jet crashed, is holding a silent march this evening in honour of the dead. French accident investigators said on Thursday that shreds of tyre had been found on the runway at Charles de Gaulle airport after the disaster. \"The tyres are under such high pressure - they are as big as truck tyres but designed to travel at over 300kph (180mph) - that anything thrown out by them bursting is as good as from a gun,\" said a retired aviation engineer who worked on British versions of the Anglo-French jet. In an earlier development, a French prosecutor promised a swift inquiry to decide whether to lay criminal charges in connection with the crash as fresh reports of a chain of mechanical problems continued to trickle out. Xavier Salvat, prosecutor for the Val d'Oise region where the luxury supersonic jet went down, said he had taken the rare step of appointing three investigative magistrates, rather than just one, because the inquiry promised to be complex. Salvat said on Thursday that the investigation would decide whether anyone should be charged with involuntary homicide and involuntary injury. \"We want to act in such a way that the proceedings both determine the cause of the accident quickly and provide information for the families of the victims,\" Salvat said. He gave no timeframe for completing the investigation, but it could last months. Air France today denied a newspaper report that the post-combustion chamber had been changed the morning of the accident and said it deplored the publication of erroneous information. French daily Le Parisien, citing unnamed sources, reported earlier that mechanics changed a pump in the post-combustion chamber of the number two engine. The pump, located near the back of the engine, sends jet fuel under high pressure into the turbine, giving a \"necessary push during take-off\", the article cited experts as saying. The newspaper also reported an aircraft mechanic as saying a malfunctioning or broken pump could turn the back portion of the turbine into a \"real blowtorch\". However, an Air France statement said: \"The only pertinent and exact information; are from the transport ministry's official investigative office and Air France. The French government said a preliminary report of the investigation would be published at the end of August.

      "body": "<p>The key to the success of turning round the NHS juggernaut lies in the numbers and the attitudes of doctors and nurses in surgeries and on the wards. No amount of bedside television or fruit for five year-olds will compensate for shortages of staff to treat the sick.</p> <p> While almost everybody yesterday agreed that the thrust of the patient-focused proposals is right, there were concerns that the proposed increased staffing levels may not be high enough to deliver them, particularly if it proves hard to persuade former NHS doctors and nurses that they could now return to a job more rewarding than the one they left. </p> <p>By 2004, there will be 2,000 more GPs, says the plan, and 450 more in training than at present. \"This will be just a start - faster growth of the number of GPs will need to continue beyond 2004,\" says the document. The British Medical Association and the Royal College of General Practitioners agree. They argue that the extra GPs will give us two per thousand head of population by 2004, when Greece already has four, Germany 3.4 and France 2.9. </p> <p>\"The country's 30,000 family doctors are currently stretched to the limit meeting current patient demand with nearly a million consultations every working day,\" said Simon Fradd, joint deputy chairman of the BMA's GPs committee. \"It's hard to see how this relatively small increase in numbers will enable us to cope with the current increase in demand, far less meet the 2004 target of access to a GP within 48 hours for non-urgent matters.\" </p> <p>Consultant numbers are to expand as well, by 30 per cent, and will be funded by central government, removing the disincentive for hospital Trusts to appoint to senior posts with large salaries. That was welcomed by the BMA, although they are bitterly opposed to the removal of their right to work in private practice for seven years after qualifying as a consultant. </p> <p>The Royal College of Nursing agrees that more staff are crucial. \"In terms of implementation it will be about getting enough nurses, doctors and therapists quickly enough to achieve the targets that are there,\" said a spokeswoman. \"That was always the issue about modernising the NHS.\" </p> <p> Nurses have left in droves through a combination of bad pay and demoralisation. The Department of Health has already been pulling out all the stops to recruit more and entice those who have left back into the profession. Recruitment campaigns, advertising and a couple of reasonable pay rises have succeeded in bringing in a few thousand extra, but an additional 20,000 are in the plan. \"There is definitely more optimism - more are wanting to stay because they feel it is changing. But the litmus test is will nurses tell friends who have left to come back because it is an exciting and good place to work.\" </p> <p>Time is not on the government's side, she said. Improvements have to have taken place before the traditional winter crisis. \"Last winter nurses who were optimistic became demoralised because they were pressured and couldn't provide good quality care.\" </p> <p>Nurses are fundamentally important to the plan. The government wants them to take on increasing responsibility, from running the wards - the return of \"matron\" - to taking over some of the clinical work of doctors, especially in general practice. </p> <p>This should take some of the burden off the shoulders of hard-pressed doctors, but it also has the advantage of shaking up old attitudes. The breaking down of old barriers between doctors and nurses is a constant theme and one that nurses, who have felt under-valued and under-used in the past, have welcomed. </p> <p>The King's Fund, the respected health policy think tank, agrees that the attitudes of people working in the NHS are crucial to change. \"Over the last few years people working in the NHS have been bombarded with one initiative after another,\" said a spokesman.</p> <p> \"It takes it out of you, frankly. We know because the government has said it that the main way we are going to get the improvements we want is through more people working in the NHS. It's not about beds or wonderful machines but about the right people in the right places with the right skills. We've got to recruit them by making the NHS an attractive place to work. Then we have got to keep them there. </p> <p>\"We have been finding people who work in the NHS are feeling very vulnerable. They are being hit around the head with all sorts of things with very little attention being paid to their own needs. We need to give them some time and some space and more in the way of autonomy.\" </p> <p>There are exciting ideas for modernising the way the NHS works, but they will not bear fruit without major cultural change, says Nigel Edwards, policy director of the NHS Confederation which represents NHS managers. </p> <p>The NHS does not have a reputation for encouraging new ideas in its staff, he said. \"If you are an innovative consultant or nurse you can very quickly have the creativity beaten out of you.\" What needs to be fostered, he says, is \"the idea that leading your clinical team and implementing good practice are as much a part of being a professional as your technical skill in looking after patients.\" </p> <p>There are some very positive proposals in the plan for supporting innovators and encouraging new ways of thinking, such as the changes in the professional roles of doctors and nurses. \"There is quite a lot there, but the challenge is for those people responsible for leading the profession and managers to pick it up,\" he said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The key to the success of turning round the NHS juggernaut lies in the numbers and the attitudes of doctors and nurses in surgeries and on the wards. No amount of bedside television or fruit for five year-olds will compensate for shortages of staff to treat the sick. While almost everybody yesterday agreed that the thrust of the patient-focused proposals is right, there were concerns that the proposed increased staffing levels may not be high enough to deliver them, particularly if it proves hard to persuade former NHS doctors and nurses that they could now return to a job more rewarding than the one they left. By 2004, there will be 2,000 more GPs, says the plan, and 450 more in training than at present. \"This will be just a start - faster growth of the number of GPs will need to continue beyond 2004,\" says the document. The British Medical Association and the Royal College of General Practitioners agree. They argue that the extra GPs will give us two per thousand head of population by 2004, when Greece already has four, Germany 3.4 and France 2.9. \"The country's 30,000 family doctors are currently stretched to the limit meeting current patient demand with nearly a million consultations every working day,\" said Simon Fradd, joint deputy chairman of the BMA's GPs committee. \"It's hard to see how this relatively small increase in numbers will enable us to cope with the current increase in demand, far less meet the 2004 target of access to a GP within 48 hours for non-urgent matters.\" Consultant numbers are to expand as well, by 30 per cent, and will be funded by central government, removing the disincentive for hospital Trusts to appoint to senior posts with large salaries. That was welcomed by the BMA, although they are bitterly opposed to the removal of their right to work in private practice for seven years after qualifying as a consultant. The Royal College of Nursing agrees that more staff are crucial. \"In terms of implementation it will be about getting enough nurses, doctors and therapists quickly enough to achieve the targets that are there,\" said a spokeswoman. \"That was always the issue about modernising the NHS.\" Nurses have left in droves through a combination of bad pay and demoralisation. The Department of Health has already been pulling out all the stops to recruit more and entice those who have left back into the profession. Recruitment campaigns, advertising and a couple of reasonable pay rises have succeeded in bringing in a few thousand extra, but an additional 20,000 are in the plan. \"There is definitely more optimism - more are wanting to stay because they feel it is changing. But the litmus test is will nurses tell friends who have left to come back because it is an exciting and good place to work.\" Time is not on the government's side, she said. Improvements have to have taken place before the traditional winter crisis. \"Last winter nurses who were optimistic became demoralised because they were pressured and couldn't provide good quality care.\" Nurses are fundamentally important to the plan. The government wants them to take on increasing responsibility, from running the wards - the return of \"matron\" - to taking over some of the clinical work of doctors, especially in general practice. This should take some of the burden off the shoulders of hard-pressed doctors, but it also has the advantage of shaking up old attitudes. The breaking down of old barriers between doctors and nurses is a constant theme and one that nurses, who have felt under-valued and under-used in the past, have welcomed. The King's Fund, the respected health policy think tank, agrees that the attitudes of people working in the NHS are crucial to change. \"Over the last few years people working in the NHS have been bombarded with one initiative after another,\" said a spokesman. \"It takes it out of you, frankly. We know because the government has said it that the main way we are going to get the improvements we want is through more people working in the NHS. It's not about beds or wonderful machines but about the right people in the right places with the right skills. We've got to recruit them by making the NHS an attractive place to work. Then we have got to keep them there. \"We have been finding people who work in the NHS are feeling very vulnerable. They are being hit around the head with all sorts of things with very little attention being paid to their own needs. We need to give them some time and some space and more in the way of autonomy.\" There are exciting ideas for modernising the way the NHS works, but they will not bear fruit without major cultural change, says Nigel Edwards, policy director of the NHS Confederation which represents NHS managers. The NHS does not have a reputation for encouraging new ideas in its staff, he said. \"If you are an innovative consultant or nurse you can very quickly have the creativity beaten out of you.\" What needs to be fostered, he says, is \"the idea that leading your clinical team and implementing good practice are as much a part of being a professional as your technical skill in looking after patients.\" There are some very positive proposals in the plan for supporting innovators and encouraging new ways of thinking, such as the changes in the professional roles of doctors and nurses. \"There is quite a lot there, but the challenge is for those people responsible for leading the profession and managers to pick it up,\" he said.",

But serious modernisation can now begin. More than money is needed, as ministers will know from reading the recent report on orthopaedic surgeons: spending 50% up in the last decade, and yet a decline in the number of patients treated down to a mere six operations per surgeon per week, when there are 250,000 on the waiting list! </p> <p>Few will argue with the need to make the NHS more patient-centred.

Even under the new plan, it is going to be 2004 before patients are guaranteed an appointment within 48 hours; 2005 before booked hospital appointments replace current waiting lists; and 2008 before the maximum waiting time for any stage of treatment is reduced to three months. Big increases in medical manpower are in the pipeline - 7,500 more consultants, 2,000 extra GPs, 20,000 extra nurses - but it takes three years to train a nurse and six years to produce a doctor. </p> <p>One potentially serious error has been avoided: this is not just an acute hospital plan. Nine out of 10 times when people use the NHS, a hospital is not involved. Primary and community services are also being improved, with 3,000 GP premises being modernised and 500 new one-stop primary centres (bringing together GPs, dentists, and opticians under one roof ) opened.

      "body": "<p>Railtrack has laid most of the blame for last October's Paddington rail crash on Thames Trains driver Michael Hodder in today's closing submissions to the inquiry into the disaster.</p> <p>The company said the infrastructure of the rail network in the Ladbroke Grove area of west London was not at fault. Instead, it blamed errors by Mr Hodder, 31, and deficiencies in his training.</p> <p>Thirty-one people, including Mr Hodder and the driver of the other train, a First Great Western express, died in the tragedy two miles from Paddington station on October 5 last year.</p> <p>Railtrack QC Roger Henderson, in his closing submission to inquiry chairman Lord Cullen, said Mr Hodder had been trained to use a button called the Driver Reminder Appliance (DRA), which stops the train from accelerating whenever a yellow signal is passed. This is designed to remind drivers that a red signal is coming up and to prevent them from speeding through when they are meant to stop.</p> <p>But Mr Hodder failed to apply the DRA at the yellow signal SN87, which would have alerted him to red signal SN109, which he subsequently passed at danger and as a result ploughed into the oncoming express.</p> <p>Mr Henderson said: \"It is probable that something or some things were causing him to believe that the coast was clear for him, although in truth the signal was properly visible and legible. Those causes are more likely than not to have centred upon a DRA trap against an important background of defective and deficient training and inexperience. For these, Mr Hodder was not to blame.\"</p> <p>But, commenting on Mr Hodder's failure to spot the yellow at signal SN87, he said: \"His attention and mind were elsewhere, but only for a moment or two. That would explain why he didn't set the DRA.\"</p> <p>Mr Henderson said, however, that although the rail infrastructure was not to blame for the Paddington crash it was possible that changes \"could have broken the chain of causation.

      "bodyText": "Railtrack has laid most of the blame for last October's Paddington rail crash on Thames Trains driver Michael Hodder in today's closing submissions to the inquiry into the disaster. The company said the infrastructure of the rail network in the Ladbroke Grove area of west London was not at fault. Instead, it blamed errors by Mr Hodder, 31, and deficiencies in his training. Thirty-one people, including Mr Hodder and the driver of the other train, a First Great Western express, died in the tragedy two miles from Paddington station on October 5 last year. Railtrack QC Roger Henderson, in his closing submission to inquiry chairman Lord Cullen, said Mr Hodder had been trained to use a button called the Driver Reminder Appliance (DRA), which stops the train from accelerating whenever a yellow signal is passed. This is designed to remind drivers that a red signal is coming up and to prevent them from speeding through when they are meant to stop. But Mr Hodder failed to apply the DRA at the yellow signal SN87, which would have alerted him to red signal SN109, which he subsequently passed at danger and as a result ploughed into the oncoming express. Mr Henderson said: \"It is probable that something or some things were causing him to believe that the coast was clear for him, although in truth the signal was properly visible and legible. Those causes are more likely than not to have centred upon a DRA trap against an important background of defective and deficient training and inexperience. For these, Mr Hodder was not to blame.\" But, commenting on Mr Hodder's failure to spot the yellow at signal SN87, he said: \"His attention and mind were elsewhere, but only for a moment or two. That would explain why he didn't set the DRA.\" Mr Henderson said, however, that although the rail infrastructure was not to blame for the Paddington crash it was possible that changes \"could have broken the chain of causation. At worst it can be said that had there been differences they might have made differences and we would not argue with that.\" A signalman who earlier in the inquiry admitted there may have been a delay of up to 25 seconds in reacting to the impending collision was also not to blame, he added. He said signaller David Allen's reaction was \"reasonable\" and said there had been \"no wait and see\" policy when dealing with a signal passed at danger. Mr Henderson finished by saying the Health &amp; Safety Executive investigation into the crash had been \"not as studied, nor as considered nor as careful as we would have hoped\". The inquiry at London's Central Hall is hearing closing submissions following 47 days of evidence from 332 witnesses. This will only be the end of part one of the inquiry, which has been examining the causes of the crash and lessons to be learned from it. It is due to hear from John Hendy QC, of the Ladbroke Grove Solicitors' Group, representing the bereaved families and injured survivors, Kenneth Hamer, of Collins Solicitors, also representing survivors and bereaved relatives, and Anthony Seys-Llewellyn for Thames Trains Ltd. Counsel to the inquiry, Robert Owen QC, will be last to make his closing remarks. The inquiry will not officially close until September. Meanwhile, Lord Cullen has said he will report a solicitor for the bereaved and injured to the Law Society for publishing legal submissions in advance of yesterday's proceedings. Lord Cullen described as \"reprehensible\" the conduct of Louise Christian, who issued a press release criticising the management of the rail industry before yesterday's closing submissions of the inquiry. He said he was satisfied that counsel was not involved and nor were any of the other lawyers in the Ladbroke Grove Solicitors' Group.",

In common with many newspaper groups it has been looking for a way to take its brands online without cannibalising too much of its existing, and cash generative, newspaper sales. CurrantBun.com, a free internet service provider linked with the Sun, was set up last year, quickly rebranded Bun.com and then after a heavy television advertising campaign sold to pan-European ISP World Online for an undisclosed sum. Lineone, an ISP and portal, was started in partnership with BT but NI pulled out and several of Lineone's technical team departed for the BBC. Lineone's media partner is now United News &amp; Media. In March, webzine theregister.co.uk got hold of a leaked NI memo from Mr MacLeod that suggested that employee morale at the new-media company was low and employees were dissatisfied with management. Mr Hinton has previously emphasised the importance of digital media to NI. In May, while outlining a series of new divisions aimed at accelerating development of NI's digital franchise, he said: \"News Network has been the catalyst in developing an expertise and culture which we can now adopt throughout the company to take full advantage of the potential presented by the new economy.\"",

      "byline": "Libby Brooks",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Here is Robert Carlyle. One of the most versatile actors of his generation, he inhabits psycho, soft touch, lover or loafer so convincingly that people often fail to realise it's the same man. He's a performer with perfect pitch. Here he is again, the star of Trainspotting and The Full Monty, two of the most commercially successful British films of the last decade. And again, coordinating an international acting career from his native Glasgow. </p> <p>Fiercely private and avowed enemy of the press, his public persona is similarly fractured: garrulous hard-nut, working-class hero, fanciable chancer, nippy sweetie. Committer of the cardinal celebrity sin of taking his work seriously. </p> <p>So here is Robert Carlyle today. He has kind eyes. \"I appreciate my life and what I've got in my life. It's always good to remind yourself, wherever you go. Me and Anastasia [his wife] are sitting there and I'm like, 'Fuck's sake, babe, this isn't bad.' I'm a very lucky man. I'm always grateful.\" </p> <p>Nothing about him is obvious. There are qualities that you sense rather than intellectualise: warmth, intelligence, honesty, cheek. He is preternatually elusive. But his body can't dissemble: it coughs at awkward questions, leans into interest, coils round a joke. </p> <p>There's a lot of light about him. There's a lot of animal about him: sex, anger, tenderness. He has a familiar face. He's only 5ft 8in but he doesn't seem smaller in real life. \"There's been a lot of aggression [in my recent work]. I didn't ever want to be seen as that, but I know I've got that reputation. I wanted to redress that balance. I've stabbed, punched, eaten people, blown them up in films for ages. I saw something in this that I needed for myself. It was very calm - an antidote for myself in a way.\" </p> <p>Thirty-nine-year-old Carlyle's latest endeavour is There's Only One Jimmy Grimble, a gentle urban fable charting the journey of a lonely Manchester City fan from playground punchbag for the rival Reds to schools' cup final hero. Alongside Gina McKee and Ray Winstone, Carlyle turns in a typically nuanced performance as Eric Wirral, Jimmy's games teacher. \"I just felt for that kid. Bullying is a terrible, terrible thing. It would be nice if any kids in that situation come to see the film and get a wee boost,\" he says eagerly, open-faced. He pauses, shakes his head to loose the sentiment, and begins to haver. \"That's idealism at its best. It's only a fucking movie, but hopefully that's what it's about.\" </p> <p>The debut feature for television director John Hay, with a budget of \u00a33m, the part was the antithesis of his last role as osprey-wielding Bond villain Renard in the \u00a373m blockbuster The World is Not Enough. \"I had a great time doing Bond, but it was an alien world. I wanted to get back to the type of films that I feel comfortable making, and that I think have some kind of social worth. You take the \u00a370m off and you can focus a wee bit more.\" </p> <p>Most of Grimble's youthful cast were first-time screen actors. \"Acting is a really insular thing. You're in this vacuum, and working with teenagers shakes you out of that because you realise your responsibility is to make sure they're okay. You can pass on what you've learned, and that's one of the most rewarding things that you can do.\" It could sound horribly Miss World were it not for the fact that's it's delivered with such enthusiasm. He mashes his knees together earnestly. The body doesn't lie. </p> <p>Doesn't Carlyle have a tendency to put himself in that vacuum? His thoroughness is legendary: learning to drive a double-decker bus for Ken Loach's Carla's Song, sleeping on the streets in preparation for Antonia Bird's Safe. But it's clean of pretention. \"To me, it's a simple thing. The people who employ me are putting their faith in me and paying me to do a job. I don't know whether it's a west of Scotland work ethic or whatever, but I feel that it's my responsibility to fulfil that for them. For those three months my life goes on hold and that seems to me to be a fair exchange for me to able to do what I do.\" </p> <p>The belief of others - as much as self-belief - seems to be very important to Robert Carlyle. The last thing anyone expects is success, he says. He talks especially tenderly about Antonia Bird's early faith in his work. Now a close friend - they set up a production company, 4Way Pictures, together with Mark Cousins, former director of the Edinburgh Film Festival - she first cast him as Safe's homeless psychotic Nosty in 1993. \"Antonia believed in me when nobody did. I'll never ever forget that. She's a good woman.\" </p> <p>His ego is modest but not fragile. If a criticism of his work is offered, he is interested to hear it, all the while making it clear that he privately maintains a complete understanding of why you are wrong. </p> <p>He is uncomfortable with words like talent. He only thinks about the OBE that Tony Blair awarded him in the New Year when journalists ask about it: \"You have to be graceful. I don't quite know how it happened to me, but I'm not going to trash it.\" The way he describes it, his hunger - to move people, to keep learning, not to take anything for granted - never shifts into something so out of control as craving. </p> <p>If Jimmy Grimble is about the grim realities of childhood, it is also about the stories we tell ourselves that allow us to escape. What were the stories Carlyle told himself as a child? \"I was always a dreamer. You couldn't keep me away from the cinema when I was a kid - I lived in the Wild West completely. When I got to 21 and I was introduced to acting again, I didn't equate the images I'd seen as a child with the theatre - it didn't seem to me to be the same world.\" Why didn't the theatre move him? \"I never believed it. I never believed myself. It's too artificial. You could say it's artificial on a film set, but when I'm in a room, in a tight situation and the camera's pretty close, I don't see anything else but the other actor I'm looking at.\" </p> <p>Carlyle's transition from tradesman to thespian is well documented, perhaps because it's one of the few stories he'll tell about himself: 75p left over on his birthday book token, chanced upon a copy of The Crucible, hooked. Stuck out the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama, formed a theatre company called Raindog taking plays to local communities, before Loach gave him his first big break, Riff Raff. He nods his head mock-doltishly when I recount it back to him. There must have been more, though. </p> <p>\"Put it into the political context of the time. The Thatcher years were beginning to bite really deep in the late 70s, jobs were vanishing and so leisure time for people was growing and growing. </p> <p>\"Acting, the arts in general, is a magnet for the wounded of society. A lot of people that came to the arts centre I went to never had any intention of going on to a career in acting, but socially they got a lot out of it, talking to people who weren't going to laugh at them, being in an environment where they could maybe get a bit of shit out of their head. They could rail against society in the safety of the rehearsal room. I became a more political person inside my own head about that time.\" And placed himself - his whole social situation - in context for the first time. </p> <p>Born in 1961, in Glasgow's Maryhill, Carlyle was brought up by his father Joseph, a painter and decorator who lived an itinerant lifestyle but was based in Scotland. (His mother left when Carlyle was a toddler - he had no contact with her until the Sunday Mirror tracked her down in 1995: \"I didn't even know what she looked like, and then these bastards dug her up. Imagine what that does to you,\" he said at the time.) </p> <p>Labour's election defeat in 1992 crushed his faith in party politics. \"The entire map of Scotland was red, and the injustice of that was just so great for me, I turned my back on that. Social politics is a different thing. I still care about how people are treated.\" </p> <p>Do those politics still inform his choices? His projects span a broad spectrum of issues: Priest was about homosexuality, Hamish Macbeth about a dope-smoking copper, The Full Monty touched on the decline of the steel industry. He hesitates. \"Everything inside me wants to say yes, but it isn't true. Bond, or Plunkett and Macleane, these films aren't anything to do with that. They're entertainment. I don't have any qualms about it. But, if I can, and if the choice is there, nine times out of 10 I'll go the other way.\" </p> <p>He is happy: his home in Glasgow with his wife of three years, giving it large on his trips to London with his pal Ray Winstone, his tight group of family and friends. It keeps him grounded, he says. </p> <p>What do they think of him in Glasgow? He wriggles in embarrassment as the answer comes into his head, and blethers for a bit before saying: \"I think they like what I do. I think there is that sense in Glasgow that he's one of us. I don't revel in it, but I like that, because that's what I've always wanted. </p> <p>\"Whenever I did anything, particularly in this tongue, I didn't want anybody to go, 'That's shite, by the way, that's not true.' I think that so far, whenever I've been asked to interpret any Scot in any way, I've told it as it is and I've sounded the way they are. I don't think I've caricatured.\" </p> <p>Which immediately brings to mind Daffy, Carlyle's sweaty - and to my mind caricatured - psycho-Scot in The Beach. \"There were a lot of problems with that film,\" he says evenly. \"When I saw the thing pieced together, I thought, 'Well, I'm in a different film.' \" He pitched his portrayal of Daffy to the character in the book, he says, not the eventual celluloid version, skewed by big-budget demands and studio imperatives.</p> <p>\"Ultimately what happened there was that I didn't really want to do it, but I love Danny [Boyle, director of the Beach]. He phoned me personally and I felt a pull. Then he threw a shitload of money at me and called it a cameo. I thought, 'Fuck it, I'm going to go and take my pals to Thailand for a month,' and at the end of the day that's basically what I did.\" He laughs.</p> <p>\"I love working with Danny,\" he adds. \"But I don't think he should be doing any more American films for a bit. I think he should come back to Britain and he should go where he knows.\"</p> <p>For someone who prides himself on withholding from interviewers, he does a good act of being forthcoming, I say. \"I think I've gone so far down this road now I can't come back. But I firmly believe in it. I think it's vital that you keep a bit of yourself back, you have to try and retain a bit of mystery. There's wee things, wee secrets that you have to keep back. Then you're always capable of surprising people. If your face is in the paper every day it's no good. It's boring. It disempowers you.\"</p> <p>A good actor must guard against public revelation, Ken Loach tells me later. \"The more you talk about feelings, the less you have them,\" he says. He calls Carlyle a generous actor, a good listener and very direct. He's also one of the few actors that he has cast twice. \"I find his responses very true.

How fucking pat is that notion? There are a lot of things that make up a performance, a lot of technical things.

      "bodyText": "Here is Robert Carlyle. One of the most versatile actors of his generation, he inhabits psycho, soft touch, lover or loafer so convincingly that people often fail to realise it's the same man. He's a performer with perfect pitch. Here he is again, the star of Trainspotting and The Full Monty, two of the most commercially successful British films of the last decade. And again, coordinating an international acting career from his native Glasgow. Fiercely private and avowed enemy of the press, his public persona is similarly fractured: garrulous hard-nut, working-class hero, fanciable chancer, nippy sweetie. Committer of the cardinal celebrity sin of taking his work seriously. So here is Robert Carlyle today. He has kind eyes. \"I appreciate my life and what I've got in my life. It's always good to remind yourself, wherever you go. Me and Anastasia [his wife] are sitting there and I'm like, 'Fuck's sake, babe, this isn't bad.' I'm a very lucky man. I'm always grateful.\" Nothing about him is obvious. There are qualities that you sense rather than intellectualise: warmth, intelligence, honesty, cheek. He is preternatually elusive. But his body can't dissemble: it coughs at awkward questions, leans into interest, coils round a joke. There's a lot of light about him. There's a lot of animal about him: sex, anger, tenderness. He has a familiar face. He's only 5ft 8in but he doesn't seem smaller in real life. \"There's been a lot of aggression [in my recent work]. I didn't ever want to be seen as that, but I know I've got that reputation. I wanted to redress that balance. I've stabbed, punched, eaten people, blown them up in films for ages. I saw something in this that I needed for myself. It was very calm - an antidote for myself in a way.\" Thirty-nine-year-old Carlyle's latest endeavour is There's Only One Jimmy Grimble, a gentle urban fable charting the journey of a lonely Manchester City fan from playground punchbag for the rival Reds to schools' cup final hero. Alongside Gina McKee and Ray Winstone, Carlyle turns in a typically nuanced performance as Eric Wirral, Jimmy's games teacher. \"I just felt for that kid. Bullying is a terrible, terrible thing. It would be nice if any kids in that situation come to see the film and get a wee boost,\" he says eagerly, open-faced. He pauses, shakes his head to loose the sentiment, and begins to haver. \"That's idealism at its best. It's only a fucking movie, but hopefully that's what it's about.\" The debut feature for television director John Hay, with a budget of \u00a33m, the part was the antithesis of his last role as osprey-wielding Bond villain Renard in the \u00a373m blockbuster The World is Not Enough. \"I had a great time doing Bond, but it was an alien world. I wanted to get back to the type of films that I feel comfortable making, and that I think have some kind of social worth. You take the \u00a370m off and you can focus a wee bit more.\" Most of Grimble's youthful cast were first-time screen actors. \"Acting is a really insular thing. You're in this vacuum, and working with teenagers shakes you out of that because you realise your responsibility is to make sure they're okay. You can pass on what you've learned, and that's one of the most rewarding things that you can do.\" It could sound horribly Miss World were it not for the fact that's it's delivered with such enthusiasm. He mashes his knees together earnestly. The body doesn't lie. Doesn't Carlyle have a tendency to put himself in that vacuum? His thoroughness is legendary: learning to drive a double-decker bus for Ken Loach's Carla's Song, sleeping on the streets in preparation for Antonia Bird's Safe. But it's clean of pretention. \"To me, it's a simple thing. The people who employ me are putting their faith in me and paying me to do a job. I don't know whether it's a west of Scotland work ethic or whatever, but I feel that it's my responsibility to fulfil that for them. For those three months my life goes on hold and that seems to me to be a fair exchange for me to able to do what I do.\" The belief of others - as much as self-belief - seems to be very important to Robert Carlyle. The last thing anyone expects is success, he says. He talks especially tenderly about Antonia Bird's early faith in his work. Now a close friend - they set up a production company, 4Way Pictures, together with Mark Cousins, former director of the Edinburgh Film Festival - she first cast him as Safe's homeless psychotic Nosty in 1993. \"Antonia believed in me when nobody did. I'll never ever forget that. She's a good woman.\" His ego is modest but not fragile. If a criticism of his work is offered, he is interested to hear it, all the while making it clear that he privately maintains a complete understanding of why you are wrong. He is uncomfortable with words like talent. He only thinks about the OBE that Tony Blair awarded him in the New Year when journalists ask about it: \"You have to be graceful. I don't quite know how it happened to me, but I'm not going to trash it.\" The way he describes it, his hunger - to move people, to keep learning, not to take anything for granted - never shifts into something so out of control as craving. If Jimmy Grimble is about the grim realities of childhood, it is also about the stories we tell ourselves that allow us to escape. What were the stories Carlyle told himself as a child? \"I was always a dreamer. You couldn't keep me away from the cinema when I was a kid - I lived in the Wild West completely. When I got to 21 and I was introduced to acting again, I didn't equate the images I'd seen as a child with the theatre - it didn't seem to me to be the same world.\" Why didn't the theatre move him? \"I never believed it. I never believed myself. It's too artificial. You could say it's artificial on a film set, but when I'm in a room, in a tight situation and the camera's pretty close, I don't see anything else but the other actor I'm looking at.\" Carlyle's transition from tradesman to thespian is well documented, perhaps because it's one of the few stories he'll tell about himself: 75p left over on his birthday book token, chanced upon a copy of The Crucible, hooked. Stuck out the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama, formed a theatre company called Raindog taking plays to local communities, before Loach gave him his first big break, Riff Raff. He nods his head mock-doltishly when I recount it back to him. There must have been more, though. \"Put it into the political context of the time. The Thatcher years were beginning to bite really deep in the late 70s, jobs were vanishing and so leisure time for people was growing and growing. \"Acting, the arts in general, is a magnet for the wounded of society. A lot of people that came to the arts centre I went to never had any intention of going on to a career in acting, but socially they got a lot out of it, talking to people who weren't going to laugh at them, being in an environment where they could maybe get a bit of shit out of their head. They could rail against society in the safety of the rehearsal room. I became a more political person inside my own head about that time.\" And placed himself - his whole social situation - in context for the first time. Born in 1961, in Glasgow's Maryhill, Carlyle was brought up by his father Joseph, a painter and decorator who lived an itinerant lifestyle but was based in Scotland. (His mother left when Carlyle was a toddler - he had no contact with her until the Sunday Mirror tracked her down in 1995: \"I didn't even know what she looked like, and then these bastards dug her up. Imagine what that does to you,\" he said at the time.) Labour's election defeat in 1992 crushed his faith in party politics. \"The entire map of Scotland was red, and the injustice of that was just so great for me, I turned my back on that. Social politics is a different thing. I still care about how people are treated.\" Do those politics still inform his choices? His projects span a broad spectrum of issues: Priest was about homosexuality, Hamish Macbeth about a dope-smoking copper, The Full Monty touched on the decline of the steel industry. He hesitates. \"Everything inside me wants to say yes, but it isn't true. Bond, or Plunkett and Macleane, these films aren't anything to do with that. They're entertainment. I don't have any qualms about it. But, if I can, and if the choice is there, nine times out of 10 I'll go the other way.\" He is happy: his home in Glasgow with his wife of three years, giving it large on his trips to London with his pal Ray Winstone, his tight group of family and friends. It keeps him grounded, he says. What do they think of him in Glasgow? He wriggles in embarrassment as the answer comes into his head, and blethers for a bit before saying: \"I think they like what I do. I think there is that sense in Glasgow that he's one of us. I don't revel in it, but I like that, because that's what I've always wanted. \"Whenever I did anything, particularly in this tongue, I didn't want anybody to go, 'That's shite, by the way, that's not true.' I think that so far, whenever I've been asked to interpret any Scot in any way, I've told it as it is and I've sounded the way they are. I don't think I've caricatured.\" Which immediately brings to mind Daffy, Carlyle's sweaty - and to my mind caricatured - psycho-Scot in The Beach. \"There were a lot of problems with that film,\" he says evenly. \"When I saw the thing pieced together, I thought, 'Well, I'm in a different film.' \" He pitched his portrayal of Daffy to the character in the book, he says, not the eventual celluloid version, skewed by big-budget demands and studio imperatives. \"Ultimately what happened there was that I didn't really want to do it, but I love Danny [Boyle, director of the Beach]. He phoned me personally and I felt a pull. Then he threw a shitload of money at me and called it a cameo. I thought, 'Fuck it, I'm going to go and take my pals to Thailand for a month,' and at the end of the day that's basically what I did.\" He laughs. \"I love working with Danny,\" he adds. \"But I don't think he should be doing any more American films for a bit. I think he should come back to Britain and he should go where he knows.\" For someone who prides himself on withholding from interviewers, he does a good act of being forthcoming, I say. \"I think I've gone so far down this road now I can't come back. But I firmly believe in it. I think it's vital that you keep a bit of yourself back, you have to try and retain a bit of mystery. There's wee things, wee secrets that you have to keep back. Then you're always capable of surprising people. If your face is in the paper every day it's no good. It's boring. It disempowers you.\" A good actor must guard against public revelation, Ken Loach tells me later. \"The more you talk about feelings, the less you have them,\" he says. He calls Carlyle a generous actor, a good listener and very direct. He's also one of the few actors that he has cast twice. \"I find his responses very true. I never feel he does things for effect, he simply plays the truth of the moment.\" Carlyle once railed against a journalist for suggesting that an actor's life informed his work. But surely some universal experiences do? \"Personal life is different from experience,\" he says. \"Whether it's my childhood or whatever, for someone to equate that with what I do as an actor is up to them, but it's too convenient to say it's because he grew up like this, that's why he's like that.

It isn't always just about pulling it up from the darkest recesses of your mind or your heart. It's your experience, and your observation. Because sometimes I'm looking at this guy in a bar and I'm watching how he's putting a glass down.\" He demonstrates with the water on the table. Normally, you'd put it down so. But Trainspotting's pub-psycho Begbie, for example, would put it down so. It's a small action. He hardly moves. He's not even looking at me. But just for a moment, I'm in a room with a loony. Clutch him and he's gone. Here is Robert Carlyle, for a moment.

The AskOJ website is not the first of Simpson's tasteful money-making wheezes. He was reportedly offered $100,000 (around \u00a364,000) to pose for photographs by his dead wife's grave. 7. The Simpson sensation has proved a nice little earner for many. It certainly gave a fillip to the instant book trade. 8. It has also made a few celebrity reputations, among them the criminal trial judge Lance Ito. 9. Though he was acquitted by a jury of his peers, most Americans still think Simpson was guilty. 10. If you share that view and don't feel like handing over \u00a36.40, you can always use the web instead to send OJ to jail. If you can.",

      "body": "<p>After three glasses of wine, Desie could no longer pretend to be following her husband's account of the canned rhinoceros hunt. Across the table she appraised Palmer Stoat as if he were a mime. His fingers danced and his mouth moved, but nothing he said reached her ears. She observed him in two dimensions, as if he were an image on a television screen: an animated middle-aged man with a slight paunch, thin blond hair, reddish eyebrows, pale skin, upcurled lips and vermilion-splotched cheeks (from too much sun or too much alcohol). </p> <p>Palmer had a soft neck but a strong chiselled chin, the surgical scars invisible in the low light. His teeth were straight and polished, but his smile had a twist of permanent skepticism. To Desie, her husband's nose had always appeared too small for his face; a little girl's nose, really, although he insisted it was the one he'd been born with. His blue eyes also seemed tiny, though quick and bright with self-confidence. His face was, in the way of prosperous ex-jocks, roundish and pre-jowly and companionable.</p> <p> Desie wouldn't have called Stoat a hunk but he was attractive in that gregarious southern frat-boy manner, and he had overwhelmed her with favours and flattery and constant attention. Later she realized that the inexhaustible energy with which Palmer had pursued their courtship was less a display of ardour than an ingrained relentlessness; it was how he went after anything he wanted. They dated for four weeks and then got married on the island of Tortola. Desie supposed she had been in a fog, and now the fog was beginning to lift. What in the world had she done? She pushed the awful question out of her mind, and when she did she was able to hear Palmer's voice again. </p> <p>\"Some creepo was tailing me,\" he was saying, \"for like a hundred miles.\" </p> <p>\"Why?\" </p> <p>Her husband snorted. \"To rob my lily-white ass, that's why.\" </p> <p>\"This was a black guy?\" Desie asked. </p> <p>\"Or a Cuban. I couldn't see which,\" Stoat said, \"but I tell you what, sweets, I was ready for the sonofabitch. Se\u00f1or Glock was in my lap, locked and loaded.\" </p> <p>\"On the turnpike, Palmer?\" </p> <p>\"He would have been one stone-dead mother.\" </p> <p>\"Just like your rhino,\" Desie said. \"By the way, are you getting her stuffed like the others?\" </p> <p>\"Mounted,\" Stoat corrected. \"And just the head.\" </p> <p>\"Lovely. We can hang it over the bed.\" </p> <p>\"Speaking of which, guess what they're doing with rhinoceros horns.\" </p> <p>\"Who's they?\" Desie asked. </p> <p>\"Asians and such.\" </p> <p>Desie knew, but she let Palmer tell the story. He concluded with Durgess's fanciful rumour of two-day erections. </p> <p>\"Can you imagine!\" Stoat hooted. </p> <p>Desie shook her head. \"Who'd even want one of those?\" </p> <p>\"Maybe you might, someday.\" He winked. </p> <p>Desie glanced around for the waiter. Where was dinner? How could it take so long to boil pasta? </p> <p>Stoat poured himself another glass of wine. \"Rhino horns, Holy Christ on a 10-speed. What next, huh?\" </p> <p>\"That's why poachers are killing them off,\" his wife said. </p> <p>\"Yeah?\" </p> <p>\"That's why they're almost extinct. God, Palmer, where have you been?\" </p> <p>\"Working for a living. So you can sit home, paint your toenails and learn all about endangered species on the Discovery Channel.\" </p> <p>Desie said, \"Try the New York Times.\" </p> <p>\"Well, pardon me.\" Stoat sniffed sarcastically. \"I read the newspaper today, oh boy.\" </p> <p>This was one of her husband's most annoying habits, dropping the lyrics of old rock songs into everyday conversation. Palmer thought it clever, and perhaps it wouldn't have bothered Desie so much if occasionally he got the words right, but he never did. Though Desie was much younger, she was familiar with the work of Dylan and the Beatles and the Stones, and so on. In college she had worked two summers at a Sam Goody outlet. </p> <p>To change the subject, she said: \"So what did Dick Artemus want?\" </p> <p>\"A new bridge.\" Stoat took a sideways bite from a sourdough roll. \"No big deal.\" </p> <p>\"A bridge to what?\" </p> <p>\"Some nowhere bird island over on the Gulf. How about passing the butter?\" </p> <p>Desie said, \"Why would the governor want a bridge to nowhere?\" </p> <p>Her husband chuckled, spraying crumbs. \"Why does the governor want anything? It's not for me to question, darling. I just take the calls and work my magic.\" </p> <p>\"A day in the life,\" said Desie. </p> <p>\"You got it.\" </p> <p>***</p> <p> Once, as a condition of a probation, Twilly Spree had been ordered to attend a course on \"anger management.\" The class was made up of men and women who had been arrested for outbursts of violence, mostly in domestic situations. There were husbands who'd clobbered their wives, wives who'd clobbered their husbands, and even one grandmother who had clobbered her 62-year-old son for blaspheming during Thanksgiving supper. Others of Twilly's classmates had been in bar fights, gambling frays and bleacher brawls at Miami Dolphins games. Three had shot guns at strangers during traffic altercations and, of those, two had been wounded by return fire. Then there was Twilly. </p> <p>The instructor of the anger-management course presented himself as a trained psychotherapist. Dr Boston was his name. On the first day he asked everyone in class to compose a short essay titled \"What Makes Me Really, Really Mad\". While the students wrote, Dr Boston went through the stack of manila file folders that had been sent to him by the court. After reading the file of Twilly Spree, Dr. Boston set it aside on a corner of the desk. \"Mr Spree,\" he said in a level tone. \"We're going to take turns sharing our stories. Would you mind going first?\" </p> <p>Twilly stood up and said: \"I'm not done with my assignment.\" </p> <p>\"You may finish it later.\" </p> <p>\"It's a question of focus, sir. I'm in the middle of a sentence.\" </p> <p>Dr. Boston paused. Inadvertently he flicked his eyes to Twilly's folder. \"All right, let's compromise. You go ahead and finish the sentence, and then you can address the class.\" </p> <p>Twilly sat down and ended the passage with the words 'ankle-deep in the blood of fools!' After a moment's thought, he changed it to 'ankle-deep in the evanescing blood of fools!'</p> <p>He stuck the pencil behind one ear and rose. </p> <p>Dr Boston said: \"Done? Good. Now please share your story with the rest of us.\" </p> <p>\"That'll take some time, the whole story will.\" </p> <p>\"Mr Spree, just tell us why you're here.\" </p> <p>\"I blew up my uncle's bank.\" </p> <p>Twilly's classmates straightened and turned in their seats. </p> <p>\"A branch,\" Twilly added, \"not the main office.\" </p> <p>Dr Boston said, \"Why do you think you did it?\" </p> <p>\"Well, I'd found out some things.\" </p> <p>\"About your uncle.\" </p> <p>\"About a loan he'd made. A very large loan to some very rotten people.\" </p> <p>\"Did you try discussing it with your uncle?\" asked Dr. Boston. </p> <p>\"About the loan? Several times. He wasn't particularly interested.\" </p> <p>\"And that made you angry?\" </p> <p>\"No, discouraged.\" Twilly squinted his eyes and locked his hands around the back of his neck. \"Disappointed, frustrated, insulted, ashamed - \" </p> <p>\"But isn't it fair to say you were angry, too? Wouldn't a person need to be pretty angry to blow up a bank building?\" </p> <p>\"No. A person would need to be resolved. That I was.\" </p> <p>Dr Boston felt the amused gaze of the other students, who were awaiting his reaction. He said, \"I believe what I'm hearing is some denial. What do the rest of you think?\" </p> <p>Twilly cut in: \"I'm not denying anything. I purchased the dynamite. I cut the fuses. I take full responsibility.\" </p> <p>Another student asked: \"Did anybody get kilt?\" </p> <p>\"Of course not,\" Twilly snapped. \"I did it on a Sunday, when the bank was closed. That's my point - if I was really pissed, I would've done it on a Monday morning, and I would've made damn sure my uncle was inside at the time.\" </p> <p>Several other probationers nodded in agreement. Dr Boston said: \"Mr Spree, a person can be very mad without pitching a fit or flying off the handle. Anger is one of those complicated emotions that can be close to the surface or buried deeply, so deeply we often don't recognise it for what it is. What I'm suggesting is that at some subconscious level you must've been extremely angry with your uncle, and probably for reasons that had nothing to do with his banking practices.\" </p> <p>Twilly frowned. \"You're saying that's not enough?\" </p> <p>\"I'm saying - \" </p> <p>\"Loaning 14m dollars to a rock-mining company that's digging craters in the Amazon River basin. What more did I need?\" </p> <p>Dr Boston said, \"It sounds like you might've had a difficult relationship with your uncle.\" </p> <p>\"I barely know the man. He lives in Chicago. That's where the bank is.\" </p> <p>\"How about when you were a boy?\" </p> <p>\"Once he took me to a football game.\" </p> <p>\"Ah. Did something happen that day?\" </p> <p>\"Yeah,\" said Twilly. \"One team scored more points than the other team, and then we went home.\" </p> <p>Now the class was snickering and it was Dr Boston's turn to manage his anger. </p> <p>\"Look, it's simple,\" Twilly said. \"I blew up the building to help him grow a conscience, OK? To make him think about the greedy wrongheaded direction his life was heading. I put it all in a letter.\" </p> <p>\"Yes, the letter's in the file,\" said Dr Boston. \"But I noticed you didn't sign your name to it.\" </p> <p>Twilly spread his hands. \"Do I look like an idiot? It's against the law, blowing up financial institutions.\" </p> <p>\"And just about anything else.\" </p> <p>\"So I've been advised,\" Twilly muttered. </p> <p>\"But, still, at a subconscious level - \" </p> <p>\"I don't have a subconscious, Doctor. That's what I'm trying to explain. Everything that happens in my brain happens right on the surface, like a stove, where I can see it and feel it and taste the heat.\" Twilly sat down and began massaging his temples with his fingertips. </p> <p>Dr Boston said, \"That would make you biologically unique in the species, Mr Spree, not having a subconscious. Don't you dream in your sleep?\" </p> <p>\"Never.\" </p> <p>\"Seriously.\" </p> <p>\"Seriously,\" Twilly said. </p> <p>\"Never once?\" </p> <p>\"Not ever in my whole life.\" </p> <p>Another probationer waved a hand. \"C'mon, man, you never had no nightmares?\" </p> <p>\"Nope,\" Twilly said. \"I can't dream. Maybe if I could I wouldn't be here now.\" </p> <p>He licked the tip of his pencil and resumed work on the essay, which he submitted to Dr Boston after class. Dr Boston did not acknowledge reading Twilly's composition, but the next morning and every morning for the following four weeks, an armed campus security guard was posted in the rear of the classroom. Dr Boston never again called on Twilly Spree to speak. At the end of the term, Twilly received a notarised certificate saying he'd successfully completed anger-management counseling, and was sent back to his probation officer, who commended him on his progress. </p> <p>***</p> <p>If only they could see me now, Twilly thought. Preparing for a hijack. </p> <p> First he'd followed the litterbug home, to one of those exclusive islands off Las Olas Boulevard, near the beach. Nice spread the guy had: old two-story Spanish stucco with barrell-tile shingles and vines crawling the walls. The house was on a cul-de-sac, leaving Twilly no safe cover for lurking in his dirty black pickup. So he found a nearby construction site - a mansion going up. The architecture was pre-Scarface Medell\u00edn, all sharp angles and marble facings and smoked glass. Twilly's truck blended in nicely among the backhoes and cement mixers. Through the twilight he strolled back toward the litterbug's home, where he melted into a hedge of thick ficus to wait. Parked in the driveway next to the Range Rover was a Beemer convertible, top down, which Twilly surmised would belong to the wife, girlfriend or boyfriend. Twilly had a notion that made him smile. </p> <p>An hour later the litterbug came out the front door. He stood in the amber light under the stucco arch and fired up a cigar. Moments later a woman emerged from the house, slowly backing out and pulling the door shut behind her; bending forward at the waist, as if saying good-bye to a small child or perhaps a dog. As the litterbug and his female companion crossed the driveway, Twilly saw her fanning the air in an exaggerated way, indicating she didn't much care for cigar smoke. This brought another smile to Twilly's face as he slipped from the hedge and hustled back to his truck. They'll be taking the ragtop, he thought. So she can breathe. </p> <p>Twilly followed the couple to an Italian restaurant on an unscenic stretch of Federal Highway, not far from the seaport. It was a magnificent choice for what Twilly had in mind. Litterbug parked the convertible in true dickhead style, diagonally across two spaces. The strategy was to protect one's expensive luxury import from scratches and dings by preventing common folks from parking next to it. Twilly was elated to witness this selfish stunt. He waited 10 minutes after the cigar-smoking man and cigar-hating woman had entered the restaurant, to make sure they'd been seated. Then he sped off on his quest. </p> <p>***</p> <p> Her stage name was Tia and she was already up on their table, already twirling her mail-order ponytail and peeling off her lacy top when the stink hit her like a blast furnace. Damn, she thought, did a sewer pipe break? </p> <p>And the three guys all grins and high fives, wearing matching dark blue coveralls with filthy sleeves; laughing and smoking and sipping their six-dollar beers and going Tee-uh, izzat how you say it? Kinda name is Tee-uh? And all three of them waving 50s, for God's sake; stinking like buzzard puke and singsonging her name, her stage name, and slipping brand-new 50-dollar bills into her G-string. So now Tia had a major decision to make, a choice between the unbelievable gutter-rot stench and the unbelievably easy money. And what she did was concentrate mightily on breathing through her mouth, so that after a while the reek didn't seem so unbearable and the truth was, hey, they were nice enough guys. Regular working stiffs. They even apologized for stinking up the joint.</p> <p> After a few table dances they asked Tia to sit and join them because they had the wildest story for her to hear. Tia said OK, just a minute, and hurried to the dressing room. In her locker she found a handkerchief, upon which she sprinkled expensive Paris perfume, another unwanted gift from another smitten customer. She returned to the table to find an open bottle of the club's priciest champagne, which was almost potable. The crew in the dirty blue coveralls was making a sloppy toast to somebody; clinking their glasses and imploring Tia to sit down, c'mon, sit. Have some bubbly. They couldn't wait to tell her what had happened, all three chattering simultaneously, raising their voices, trying to take charge of the storytelling. Tia, holding the scented hankie under her nose, found herself authentically entertained and of course not believing a word they said, except for the part about their occupations, which they could hardly embellish, given the odour. </p> <p>How come you don't believe we got our load hijacked! one of them exclaimed. </p> <p>Because it's ridiculous, said Tia. </p> <p>Really it was more of a trade, said one of his pals. The young man give us three grand cash and the use of his pickup and told us to meet back here in a hour. </p> <p>Tia flared her eyebrows. This total stranger, he hands you 3,000 bucks and drives off in a - </p> <p>All 50s, one of the men said, waving a handful of bills. A grand each! </p> <p>Tia, giggling through the handkerchief: You guys are seriously fulla shit. </p> <p>No, ma'am, we ain't. We might smell like we are, but we ain't. </p> <p>The one waving the fattest wad was talking loudest. What we told you, he said, that's the honest-to-God truth of how we come to be here tonight, watchin' you dance. And if you don't believe it, Miz Tee-uh, just come out back to the parkin' lot in about 15 minutes when the boy gets back. </p> <p>Maybe I will, said Tia. </p> <p>But by then she was busy entertaining a table of cable-TV executives, so she missed seeing Twilly Spree drive up to the neon-lit strip club in a full-sized county garbage truck. When Twilly got out, one of the men in blue coveralls tossed him the keys to the black pickup. </p> <p>\"You guys go through all that dough I gave you?\" Twilly asked amiably. </p> <p>\"No, but just about.\" </p> <p>\"And it was worth every dollar, I bet.\" </p> <p>\"Oh yeah.\" </p> <p>Twilly shook hands with each of the men and said goodbye. </p> <p>\"Wait, son, come on inside and have just one beer. We got a lady wants to meet you.\" </p> <p>\"Rain check,\" said Twilly. </p> <p>\"No, but see, she don't believe us. She thinks we robbed the bingo hall or somethin'. That's how come you gotta come inside just for a minute, to tell her it's no bullshit, you paid us three grand to rent out the shitwagon.\" </p> <p>Twilly smiled. \"I don't know what you're talking about.\" </p> <p>\"Hey, man, where's the load? The truck, it looks empty.\" </p> <p>\"That's right,\" Twilly said. \"There's nothing to haul to the dump. You guys can go straight on home tonight.\" </p> <p>\"But what happened to it?\" </p> <p>\"Best you don't know.\" </p> <p>\"Oh Lord,\" one of the garbagemen muttered to his pals. \"This is a crazy-ass boy. He's gone done some crazy-ass thing.\" </p> <p>\"No,\" Twilly said, \"I believe you'd approve. I really do.\" Then he drove off, thinking how wrong Dr Boston had been. Anger wasn't such a complicated emotion. </p> <p>***</p> <p> Palmer Stoat ordered an antipasto salad, garlic rolls, fettuccine Alfredo, a side of meatballs, and before long Desie had to look away, for fear of being sick. He was perspiring, that's how hard he went at the food; droplets of sweat streaking both sides of his jawline. Desie was ashamed of herself for feeling so revulsed; this was her husband, after all. It wasn't as if his personality had transformed after they got married. He was the same man in all respects, two years later. Desie felt guilty about marrying him, guilty about having second thoughts, guilty about the rhinoceros he'd shot dead that morning. </p> <p>\"From here to the salad bar,\" Stoat was telling her. \"That's how close she was.\" </p> <p>\"And for that you needed a scope?\" </p> <p>\"Better safe than sorry. That's Durgess's motto.\" </p> <p>Stoat ordered tortoni for dessert. He used a fork to probe the ice cream for fragments of almonds, which he raked into a tidy pattern along the perimeter of the plate. Watching the fastidious ritual plunged Desie deeper into melancholy. Later, while Palmer reviewed the bill, she excused herself and went to the rest room, where she dampened a paper towel to wipe off her lipstick and makeup. She had no idea why, but it made her feel much better. By the time she finished, her husband was gone from the restaurant. </p> <p>Desie walked outside and was nearly poleaxed by the smell. She cupped her hands to her mouth and looked around for Palmer. He was in the parking lot, beneath a streetlight. As Desie approached him, the odour got worse, and soon she saw why: a sour mound of garbage 10 feet high. Desie estimated it to weigh several tons. Palmer Stoat stood at the base of the fetid hill, his eyes fixed lugubriously on the peak. </p> <p>\"Where's the car?\" Desie asked with a cough. </p> <p>Palmer's arms flopped at his sides. He began squeaking like a lost kitten. </p> <p>\"Don't tell me.\" She struggled not to gag on the stink. \"Dammit, Palmer. My Beemer!\" </p> <p>Haltingly he began to circle the rancid dune. He raised an arm, pointing in outraged stupefaction. A cloud of flies buzzed about his face, but he made no effort to shoo them away. </p> <p>\"Goddammit,\" Desie cried. \"Didn't I tell you to put the top up? Didn't I?\"</p>",

Palmer had a soft neck but a strong chiselled chin, the surgical scars invisible in the low light. His teeth were straight and polished, but his smile had a twist of permanent skepticism. To Desie, her husband's nose had always appeared too small for his face; a little girl's nose, really, although he insisted it was the one he'd been born with. His blue eyes also seemed tiny, though quick and bright with self-confidence. His face was, in the way of prosperous ex-jocks, roundish and pre-jowly and companionable. Desie wouldn't have called Stoat a hunk but he was attractive in that gregarious southern frat-boy manner, and he had overwhelmed her with favours and flattery and constant attention. Later she realized that the inexhaustible energy with which Palmer had pursued their courtship was less a display of ardour than an ingrained relentlessness; it was how he went after anything he wanted. They dated for four weeks and then got married on the island of Tortola. Desie supposed she had been in a fog, and now the fog was beginning to lift. What in the world had she done? She pushed the awful question out of her mind, and when she did she was able to hear Palmer's voice again. \"Some creepo was tailing me,\" he was saying, \"for like a hundred miles.\" \"Why?\" Her husband snorted. \"To rob my lily-white ass, that's why.\" \"This was a black guy?\" Desie asked. \"Or a Cuban. I couldn't see which,\" Stoat said, \"but I tell you what, sweets, I was ready for the sonofabitch. Se\u00f1or Glock was in my lap, locked and loaded.\" \"On the turnpike, Palmer?\" \"He would have been one stone-dead mother.\" \"Just like your rhino,\" Desie said. \"By the way, are you getting her stuffed like the others?\" \"Mounted,\" Stoat corrected. \"And just the head.\" \"Lovely. We can hang it over the bed.\" \"Speaking of which, guess what they're doing with rhinoceros horns.\" \"Who's they?\" Desie asked. \"Asians and such.\" Desie knew, but she let Palmer tell the story. He concluded with Durgess's fanciful rumour of two-day erections. \"Can you imagine!\" Stoat hooted. Desie shook her head. \"Who'd even want one of those?\" \"Maybe you might, someday.\" He winked. Desie glanced around for the waiter. Where was dinner? How could it take so long to boil pasta? Stoat poured himself another glass of wine. \"Rhino horns, Holy Christ on a 10-speed. What next, huh?\" \"That's why poachers are killing them off,\" his wife said. \"Yeah?\" \"That's why they're almost extinct. God, Palmer, where have you been?\" \"Working for a living. So you can sit home, paint your toenails and learn all about endangered species on the Discovery Channel.\" Desie said, \"Try the New York Times.\" \"Well, pardon me.\" Stoat sniffed sarcastically. \"I read the newspaper today, oh boy.\" This was one of her husband's most annoying habits, dropping the lyrics of old rock songs into everyday conversation. Palmer thought it clever, and perhaps it wouldn't have bothered Desie so much if occasionally he got the words right, but he never did. Though Desie was much younger, she was familiar with the work of Dylan and the Beatles and the Stones, and so on. In college she had worked two summers at a Sam Goody outlet. To change the subject, she said: \"So what did Dick Artemus want?\" \"A new bridge.\" Stoat took a sideways bite from a sourdough roll. \"No big deal.\" \"A bridge to what?\" \"Some nowhere bird island over on the Gulf. How about passing the butter?\" Desie said, \"Why would the governor want a bridge to nowhere?\" Her husband chuckled, spraying crumbs. \"Why does the governor want anything? It's not for me to question, darling. I just take the calls and work my magic.\" \"A day in the life,\" said Desie. \"You got it.\" *** Once, as a condition of a probation, Twilly Spree had been ordered to attend a course on \"anger management.\" The class was made up of men and women who had been arrested for outbursts of violence, mostly in domestic situations. There were husbands who'd clobbered their wives, wives who'd clobbered their husbands, and even one grandmother who had clobbered her 62-year-old son for blaspheming during Thanksgiving supper. Others of Twilly's classmates had been in bar fights, gambling frays and bleacher brawls at Miami Dolphins games. Three had shot guns at strangers during traffic altercations and, of those, two had been wounded by return fire. Then there was Twilly. The instructor of the anger-management course presented himself as a trained psychotherapist. Dr Boston was his name. On the first day he asked everyone in class to compose a short essay titled \"What Makes Me Really, Really Mad\". While the students wrote, Dr Boston went through the stack of manila file folders that had been sent to him by the court. After reading the file of Twilly Spree, Dr. Boston set it aside on a corner of the desk. \"Mr Spree,\" he said in a level tone. \"We're going to take turns sharing our stories. Would you mind going first?\" Twilly stood up and said: \"I'm not done with my assignment.\" \"You may finish it later.\" \"It's a question of focus, sir. I'm in the middle of a sentence.\" Dr. Boston paused. Inadvertently he flicked his eyes to Twilly's folder. \"All right, let's compromise. You go ahead and finish the sentence, and then you can address the class.\" Twilly sat down and ended the passage with the words 'ankle-deep in the blood of fools!' After a moment's thought, he changed it to 'ankle-deep in the evanescing blood of fools!' He stuck the pencil behind one ear and rose. Dr Boston said: \"Done? Good. Now please share your story with the rest of us.\" \"That'll take some time, the whole story will.\" \"Mr Spree, just tell us why you're here.\" \"I blew up my uncle's bank.\" Twilly's classmates straightened and turned in their seats. \"A branch,\" Twilly added, \"not the main office.\" Dr Boston said, \"Why do you think you did it?\" \"Well, I'd found out some things.\" \"About your uncle.\" \"About a loan he'd made. A very large loan to some very rotten people.\" \"Did you try discussing it with your uncle?\" asked Dr. Boston. \"About the loan? Several times. He wasn't particularly interested.\" \"And that made you angry?\" \"No, discouraged.\" Twilly squinted his eyes and locked his hands around the back of his neck. \"Disappointed, frustrated, insulted, ashamed - \" \"But isn't it fair to say you were angry, too? Wouldn't a person need to be pretty angry to blow up a bank building?\" \"No. A person would need to be resolved. That I was.\" Dr Boston felt the amused gaze of the other students, who were awaiting his reaction. He said, \"I believe what I'm hearing is some denial. What do the rest of you think?\" Twilly cut in: \"I'm not denying anything. I purchased the dynamite. I cut the fuses. I take full responsibility.\" Another student asked: \"Did anybody get kilt?\" \"Of course not,\" Twilly snapped. \"I did it on a Sunday, when the bank was closed. That's my point - if I was really pissed, I would've done it on a Monday morning, and I would've made damn sure my uncle was inside at the time.\" Several other probationers nodded in agreement. Dr Boston said: \"Mr Spree, a person can be very mad without pitching a fit or flying off the handle. Anger is one of those complicated emotions that can be close to the surface or buried deeply, so deeply we often don't recognise it for what it is. What I'm suggesting is that at some subconscious level you must've been extremely angry with your uncle, and probably for reasons that had nothing to do with his banking practices.\" Twilly frowned. \"You're saying that's not enough?\" \"I'm saying - \" \"Loaning 14m dollars to a rock-mining company that's digging craters in the Amazon River basin. What more did I need?\" Dr Boston said, \"It sounds like you might've had a difficult relationship with your uncle.\" \"I barely know the man. He lives in Chicago. That's where the bank is.\" \"How about when you were a boy?\" \"Once he took me to a football game.\" \"Ah. Did something happen that day?\" \"Yeah,\" said Twilly. \"One team scored more points than the other team, and then we went home.\" Now the class was snickering and it was Dr Boston's turn to manage his anger. \"Look, it's simple,\" Twilly said. \"I blew up the building to help him grow a conscience, OK? To make him think about the greedy wrongheaded direction his life was heading. I put it all in a letter.\" \"Yes, the letter's in the file,\" said Dr Boston. \"But I noticed you didn't sign your name to it.\" Twilly spread his hands. \"Do I look like an idiot? It's against the law, blowing up financial institutions.\" \"And just about anything else.\" \"So I've been advised,\" Twilly muttered. \"But, still, at a subconscious level - \" \"I don't have a subconscious, Doctor. That's what I'm trying to explain. Everything that happens in my brain happens right on the surface, like a stove, where I can see it and feel it and taste the heat.\" Twilly sat down and began massaging his temples with his fingertips. Dr Boston said, \"That would make you biologically unique in the species, Mr Spree, not having a subconscious. Don't you dream in your sleep?\" \"Never.\" \"Seriously.\" \"Seriously,\" Twilly said. \"Never once?\" \"Not ever in my whole life.\" Another probationer waved a hand. \"C'mon, man, you never had no nightmares?\" \"Nope,\" Twilly said. \"I can't dream. Maybe if I could I wouldn't be here now.\" He licked the tip of his pencil and resumed work on the essay, which he submitted to Dr Boston after class. Dr Boston did not acknowledge reading Twilly's composition, but the next morning and every morning for the following four weeks, an armed campus security guard was posted in the rear of the classroom. Dr Boston never again called on Twilly Spree to speak. At the end of the term, Twilly received a notarised certificate saying he'd successfully completed anger-management counseling, and was sent back to his probation officer, who commended him on his progress. *** If only they could see me now, Twilly thought. Preparing for a hijack. First he'd followed the litterbug home, to one of those exclusive islands off Las Olas Boulevard, near the beach. Nice spread the guy had: old two-story Spanish stucco with barrell-tile shingles and vines crawling the walls. The house was on a cul-de-sac, leaving Twilly no safe cover for lurking in his dirty black pickup. So he found a nearby construction site - a mansion going up. The architecture was pre-Scarface Medell\u00edn, all sharp angles and marble facings and smoked glass. Twilly's truck blended in nicely among the backhoes and cement mixers. Through the twilight he strolled back toward the litterbug's home, where he melted into a hedge of thick ficus to wait. Parked in the driveway next to the Range Rover was a Beemer convertible, top down, which Twilly surmised would belong to the wife, girlfriend or boyfriend. Twilly had a notion that made him smile. An hour later the litterbug came out the front door. He stood in the amber light under the stucco arch and fired up a cigar. Moments later a woman emerged from the house, slowly backing out and pulling the door shut behind her; bending forward at the waist, as if saying good-bye to a small child or perhaps a dog. As the litterbug and his female companion crossed the driveway, Twilly saw her fanning the air in an exaggerated way, indicating she didn't much care for cigar smoke. This brought another smile to Twilly's face as he slipped from the hedge and hustled back to his truck. They'll be taking the ragtop, he thought. So she can breathe. Twilly followed the couple to an Italian restaurant on an unscenic stretch of Federal Highway, not far from the seaport. It was a magnificent choice for what Twilly had in mind. Litterbug parked the convertible in true dickhead style, diagonally across two spaces. The strategy was to protect one's expensive luxury import from scratches and dings by preventing common folks from parking next to it. Twilly was elated to witness this selfish stunt. He waited 10 minutes after the cigar-smoking man and cigar-hating woman had entered the restaurant, to make sure they'd been seated. Then he sped off on his quest. *** Her stage name was Tia and she was already up on their table, already twirling her mail-order ponytail and peeling off her lacy top when the stink hit her like a blast furnace. Damn, she thought, did a sewer pipe break? And the three guys all grins and high fives, wearing matching dark blue coveralls with filthy sleeves; laughing and smoking and sipping their six-dollar beers and going Tee-uh, izzat how you say it? Kinda name is Tee-uh? And all three of them waving 50s, for God's sake; stinking like buzzard puke and singsonging her name, her stage name, and slipping brand-new 50-dollar bills into her G-string. So now Tia had a major decision to make, a choice between the unbelievable gutter-rot stench and the unbelievably easy money. And what she did was concentrate mightily on breathing through her mouth, so that after a while the reek didn't seem so unbearable and the truth was, hey, they were nice enough guys. Regular working stiffs. They even apologized for stinking up the joint. After a few table dances they asked Tia to sit and join them because they had the wildest story for her to hear. Tia said OK, just a minute, and hurried to the dressing room. In her locker she found a handkerchief, upon which she sprinkled expensive Paris perfume, another unwanted gift from another smitten customer. She returned to the table to find an open bottle of the club's priciest champagne, which was almost potable. The crew in the dirty blue coveralls was making a sloppy toast to somebody; clinking their glasses and imploring Tia to sit down, c'mon, sit. Have some bubbly. They couldn't wait to tell her what had happened, all three chattering simultaneously, raising their voices, trying to take charge of the storytelling. Tia, holding the scented hankie under her nose, found herself authentically entertained and of course not believing a word they said, except for the part about their occupations, which they could hardly embellish, given the odour. How come you don't believe we got our load hijacked! one of them exclaimed. Because it's ridiculous, said Tia. Really it was more of a trade, said one of his pals. The young man give us three grand cash and the use of his pickup and told us to meet back here in a hour. Tia flared her eyebrows. This total stranger, he hands you 3,000 bucks and drives off in a - All 50s, one of the men said, waving a handful of bills. A grand each! Tia, giggling through the handkerchief: You guys are seriously fulla shit. No, ma'am, we ain't. We might smell like we are, but we ain't. The one waving the fattest wad was talking loudest. What we told you, he said, that's the honest-to-God truth of how we come to be here tonight, watchin' you dance. And if you don't believe it, Miz Tee-uh, just come out back to the parkin' lot in about 15 minutes when the boy gets back. Maybe I will, said Tia. But by then she was busy entertaining a table of cable-TV executives, so she missed seeing Twilly Spree drive up to the neon-lit strip club in a full-sized county garbage truck. When Twilly got out, one of the men in blue coveralls tossed him the keys to the black pickup. \"You guys go through all that dough I gave you?\" Twilly asked amiably. \"No, but just about.\" \"And it was worth every dollar, I bet.\" \"Oh yeah.\" Twilly shook hands with each of the men and said goodbye. \"Wait, son, come on inside and have just one beer. We got a lady wants to meet you.\" \"Rain check,\" said Twilly. \"No, but see, she don't believe us. She thinks we robbed the bingo hall or somethin'. That's how come you gotta come inside just for a minute, to tell her it's no bullshit, you paid us three grand to rent out the shitwagon.\" Twilly smiled. \"I don't know what you're talking about.\" \"Hey, man, where's the load? The truck, it looks empty.\" \"That's right,\" Twilly said. \"There's nothing to haul to the dump. You guys can go straight on home tonight.\" \"But what happened to it?\" \"Best you don't know.\" \"Oh Lord,\" one of the garbagemen muttered to his pals. \"This is a crazy-ass boy. He's gone done some crazy-ass thing.\" \"No,\" Twilly said, \"I believe you'd approve. I really do.\" Then he drove off, thinking how wrong Dr Boston had been. Anger wasn't such a complicated emotion. *** Palmer Stoat ordered an antipasto salad, garlic rolls, fettuccine Alfredo, a side of meatballs, and before long Desie had to look away, for fear of being sick. He was perspiring, that's how hard he went at the food; droplets of sweat streaking both sides of his jawline. Desie was ashamed of herself for feeling so revulsed; this was her husband, after all. It wasn't as if his personality had transformed after they got married. He was the same man in all respects, two years later. Desie felt guilty about marrying him, guilty about having second thoughts, guilty about the rhinoceros he'd shot dead that morning. \"From here to the salad bar,\" Stoat was telling her. \"That's how close she was.\" \"And for that you needed a scope?\" \"Better safe than sorry. That's Durgess's motto.\" Stoat ordered tortoni for dessert. He used a fork to probe the ice cream for fragments of almonds, which he raked into a tidy pattern along the perimeter of the plate. Watching the fastidious ritual plunged Desie deeper into melancholy. Later, while Palmer reviewed the bill, she excused herself and went to the rest room, where she dampened a paper towel to wipe off her lipstick and makeup. She had no idea why, but it made her feel much better. By the time she finished, her husband was gone from the restaurant. Desie walked outside and was nearly poleaxed by the smell. She cupped her hands to her mouth and looked around for Palmer. He was in the parking lot, beneath a streetlight. As Desie approached him, the odour got worse, and soon she saw why: a sour mound of garbage 10 feet high. Desie estimated it to weigh several tons. Palmer Stoat stood at the base of the fetid hill, his eyes fixed lugubriously on the peak. \"Where's the car?\" Desie asked with a cough. Palmer's arms flopped at his sides. He began squeaking like a lost kitten. \"Don't tell me.\" She struggled not to gag on the stink. \"Dammit, Palmer. My Beemer!\" Haltingly he began to circle the rancid dune. He raised an arm, pointing in outraged stupefaction. A cloud of flies buzzed about his face, but he made no effort to shoo them away. \"Goddammit,\" Desie cried. \"Didn't I tell you to put the top up? Didn't I?\"",

      "bodyText": "The Concorde which crashed on take-off from Paris on Tuesday underwent extensive engine repairs earlier the same day in addition to the last-minute mechanical work requested by its pilot, it was revealed today. Technicians spent most of the morning working on both engines on the left side of the plane which, the crash inquiry team has confirmed, failed as Flight 4590 lifted off from Charles de Gaulle airport. The Concorde - the oldest of the six-strong Air France fleet - had flown in from New York on Monday with a list of minor work entered in its technical log book. The most important work involved the post-combustion pumps on engines one and two, which feed raw fuel into the engines for extra thrust on take-off - just like a fighter aircraft. Yesterday, the French newspaper Le Parisien reported that mechanics had changed an entire pump in the post-combustion chamber of the second engine as they carried out the repairs. An aircraft mechanic was also quoted, claiming that a malfunctioning or broken pump could turn the back section of a turbine into a \"real blowtorch\". But Air France refused to confirm the report, attributed to unnamed sources, which stated that the repairs were carried out just hours before a reverse thruster in the same engine was replaced. As relatives of the 113 victims of the disaster - 109 of whom were on the plane and four of whom were killed when it crashed into a hotel at Gonesse, just outside Paris - continued to wait for confirmation of their loved ones' identities, speculation increased as to the possible causes of the tragedy. Last night's first statement from the French accident investigation bureau confirmed that, during take-off, the pilot, Christian Marty, had warned the control tower that engine number two had \"broken down\" and that engine number one had also lost power twice. He also told the control tower he could not retract the craft's undercarriage. But investigators also admitted that remains of tyres had been found on the runway at the airport. This suggests that one of the eight tyres had burst, with shreds being sucked into the jet's number two engine, triggering the explosion and sending shards of metal through the wing. The blast would have wrecked the plane's electrical and hydraulic systems, giving Marty and his crew no chance to avert disaster - and explaining why the undercarriage could not be raised. As many of the relatives of the 96 German victims returned home to the sombre task of arranging funerals, the French prosecutor in charge of the Val d'Oise region where the supersonic jet went down pledged a swift investigation to decide whether Air France should face criminal charges in connection with the tragedy. Xavier Salvat said he had taken the rare step of appointing three investigative magistrates instead of one to conduct the manslaughter inquiry - standard practice in France where a death is involved - because it promised to be complex. \"We want to act in such a way that the proceedings both determine the cause of the accident quickly and provide information for the families of the victims,\" he said. He could give no timeframe for the investigation, which it is believed could take months. A preliminary technical report, from the accident investigation bureau, is likely by the end of August, but completion for the full inquiry is unlikely for months, the French ministry of transport said yesterday.",

There were, said the judge \"plenty of those minds in Silicon Valley\" capable of devising suitable software.</p> <p>Earlier, attorney Russ Frackman, for the music industry, said: \"This is the most egregious case of copyright infringement that has ever existed.\" He said that 14,000 recordings were downloaded every minute, around 20m a day. Of these, around 90% were copyrighted. Napster has said that it anticipates 70m users by the end of this year, the court heard.</p> <p>For Napster, attorney David Boies said his client had not had any substantial adverse effect on the market. Another Napster attorney, Daniel Johnson, said: \"You cannot put the genie back in the bottle.\"</p> <p>In the space of nine months, Napster, which is based in the Bay Area, has changed the pattern of distributing music. It acts as a clearing house directing users towards computers where songs can be downloaded and swapped.</p> <p>The record industry has objected to this operation on the grounds that an estimated 20m people have been \"song-swapping\" via Napster and that this has cost the industry $300m (\u00a3200m) in lost sales. The industry argued the company was facilitating this loss of revenue to artists.</p> <p>In May 9 in San Francisco, Judge Patel rejected Napster's claims that it was protected from the illegal actions of its users.</p> <p>Napster has subsequently argued that the personal copying of music via the internet is protected by federal law in the same way that it is not illegal to tape-record music.</p> <p>The industry claims that there is a great difference between, for instance, the loan of a CD so that a friend can copy it and the placing of that music on the internet so that the world can copy it.</p> <p>Interest in the case had been heightened by the band Metallica filing its own suit against Napster, accusing the company of stealing its music.</p> <p>The band's drummer, Lars Ulrich, told a Senate committee that \"it's like... one of those contests where you get turned loose in a store for five minutes and get to keep everything you can load into your shopping cart\".</p> <p>Despite the ruling, the general belief within the world of e-commerce is that it will not be possible to reverse what Napster has achieved.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In a ruling with immeasurable consequences for the uses of the internet, a San Francisco judge yesterday granted a temporary injunction to the music industry to prevent the internet firm Napster from distributing and copying music. Napster has claimed that the ruling could put it out of business and will have ramifications for the whole industry. Judge Marilyn Hall Patel granted the temporary injunction sought by the Recording Industry Association of America that will prevent Napster from making copyrighted music available on the internet until a full trial is held. She told a packed federal court that the plaintiffs had established a \"strong likelihood of success\" in the forthcoming trial and might suffer \"irreparable\" damage if Napster continued to distribute free music over the internet. The judge portrayed Napster's attitude as \"piracy be damned... piracy was pretty much uppermost in their minds. [It was] 'Free music for the people'!\" She said that Napster's claims about wanting to assist unknown bands were not its reason for operating. The court heard of exchanges between Napster executives referring to \"bringing about the death of the CD\" and making Tower Records \"obsolete\". She said it was clear that piracy was its purpose. The judge added that the claims that an injunction would put Napster out of business was \"like becoming an orphan by your own hand and then throwing yourself at the mercy of the court because you're an orphan\". She suggested that it should be possible for Napster to come up with a way of supervising and policing the distribution of copyrighted music.

Earlier, attorney Russ Frackman, for the music industry, said: \"This is the most egregious case of copyright infringement that has ever existed.\" He said that 14,000 recordings were downloaded every minute, around 20m a day. Of these, around 90% were copyrighted. Napster has said that it anticipates 70m users by the end of this year, the court heard. For Napster, attorney David Boies said his client had not had any substantial adverse effect on the market. Another Napster attorney, Daniel Johnson, said: \"You cannot put the genie back in the bottle.\" In the space of nine months, Napster, which is based in the Bay Area, has changed the pattern of distributing music. It acts as a clearing house directing users towards computers where songs can be downloaded and swapped. The record industry has objected to this operation on the grounds that an estimated 20m people have been \"song-swapping\" via Napster and that this has cost the industry $300m (\u00a3200m) in lost sales. The industry argued the company was facilitating this loss of revenue to artists. In May 9 in San Francisco, Judge Patel rejected Napster's claims that it was protected from the illegal actions of its users. Napster has subsequently argued that the personal copying of music via the internet is protected by federal law in the same way that it is not illegal to tape-record music. The industry claims that there is a great difference between, for instance, the loan of a CD so that a friend can copy it and the placing of that music on the internet so that the world can copy it. Interest in the case had been heightened by the band Metallica filing its own suit against Napster, accusing the company of stealing its music. The band's drummer, Lars Ulrich, told a Senate committee that \"it's like... one of those contests where you get turned loose in a store for five minutes and get to keep everything you can load into your shopping cart\". Despite the ruling, the general belief within the world of e-commerce is that it will not be possible to reverse what Napster has achieved.",

      "body": "<p>There was no doubt about it: there was something familiar about that basket. When an employee of the fashionable bag designer Lulu Guinness walked into high street retailer Accessorize one afternoon last February, she was \"horrified\" to see for sale two styles of wicker baskets distinctly reminiscent of ones designed earlier that year by her boss. The Accessorize ones, however, were retailing at a tenth of the price. </p> <p>\"This is beginning to happen more and more on the high street,\" says Charlotte Macfarlane, managing director of Lulu Guinness. \"These days we are having to concentrate much more on defending our copyright and we are considering taking out insurance against further legal action.\" </p> <p>What a sign of the times. Once the line between high fashion designers and high street retailers was marked by more than the difference in the price tags. But in the past decade, high street retailers have realised that even those without bloated bank accounts like to keep abreast of high fashion trends. Having perceived this noticeable gap in the market, they have since been mining a very rich seam by offering similar, but much cheaper, copies of high fashion clothes. What is seen on the catwalks this season is becoming a reliable indicator of what will be on the high street next month, minus a couple of zeros from the price. In Italy, copies of Prada bags and JP Tods totes are sold from blankets on the pavement, only to be shoved into a carrier bag if a police car is heard nearby; here copies (albeit not as blatant) are sold on the high street. </p> <p>Guinness, however, was more fortunate. After her complaint in February, Accessorize launched an internal investigation, before finally conceding the similarities on June 28. An out of court settlement was reached in which Accessorize paid all the legal costs incurred, as well as handing over the two styles of basket. Lulu Guinness Ltd, in suitably dramatic fashion, burned the offending items. </p> <p>\"The artwork on the basket was perhaps similar,\" admits Nicky Pike, managing director of Accessorize. \"But it is quite a common weave.\" </p> <p>In an ironic twist to the saga, last Saturday a different Lulu Guinness basket, which retails for \u00a3120, appeared in a newspaper supplement, photographed, in apparent ignorance of the recent affray, next to a twin version from Tesco, priced at \u00a38. \"Yes, we are considering further action,\" Macfarlane sighs, rather wearily. \"That's all we can say at the moment.\" </p> <p>Lindsey Robinson, marketing manager of Tesco Clothing, however, was surprised at the suggestion of a potential problem. \"Everyone takes inspiration from high fashion designers,\" she points out. </p> <p>Fashion inevitably takes influences from predecessors and contemporaries. But where does inspiration end and downright plagiarism begin? This question is increasingly plaguing the once happily distant relationship between high fashion designers and high street retailers. This season's offerings from the latter are so similar to those of the former that their audacity can be breathtaking. Morgan has produced a pattern similar to the familiar Burberry print (which is, in fact, a registered trademark); LK Bennett is offering its own version of last season's shoe sensation, Marc Jacobs' stitched pump; Office, with commendable speed, has already produced 1940s-style pumps in the style of the new Pradas (and at a sixth of the price), almost before the Prada versions are on the shelves. </p> <p>\"Obviously, as a high street retailer, it would be suicidal to ignore what the leading design houses are doing,\" says Lynsey Hand, ladies buyer at Office. \"Basically, we take note of the main fashion themes, then we come up with our own ideas around those.\" </p> <p>The high street has democratised the whole concept of fashion: to be able to dress in desirable clothes similar to those seen in fashion magazines is no longer the privilege of the phenomenally well-heeled. High fashion has now, through the high street filter, become more relevant to more people. So shouldn't designers simply smile benignly at their aspiring retail companions and see this mimicry as a compliment? </p> <p>\"It's not a compliment when it harms our business,\" Macfarlane retorts. \"Of course I can see the point of high street copies - not everyone can afford full-price Prada or Gucci - but the high street has to realise that designers have businesses to run.\" </p> <p>Pat Marsh, chairman of Philip Treacy, agrees. \"In terms of size, we are a David in an industry of Goliath manufacturers and we can ill-afford to see Philip's unique talent plagiarised. In our view, any such act is no different from a famous artist having his paintings copied without permission, reproduced and sold for profit.\" </p> <p>\"Lulu is a directional designer and people do take inspiration from her,\" Macfarlane continues. \"But the Accessorize baskets were too close. The high street is there to provide the essence of fashion - it should not go as far as blatant copying.\" </p> <p> High street retailers respond that they are at the mercy of both customer demand and their suppliers. \"Fifty per cent of our products are bought from manufacturers and developers in the UK and far east, and these baskets came from the far east,\" Pike explains. \"In fact, the same baskets are available in at least three other high street retailers. We really were an innocent infringer.\" </p> <p>It is not only the high street that occasionally gets into trouble. In 1993, London-based design team Antoni and Alison received an out of court settlement from Giorgio Armani who, they alleged, had produced a T-shirt bearing a logo too close to their own. In 1994, Ralph Lauren paid \u00a3250,000 in damages to Yves Saint Laurent for copyright infringement of a black tuxedo evening sheath. </p> <p>But thanks to the increasingly sophisticated copies available, the high street is stronger than ever. Even celebrities and the proudly high-maintenance It girls can be spotted picking up cut-price Chloe aviator sunglasses at Oxford Circus. So it is unsurprising that designers are glancing anxiously towards these less costly interpretations of their clothes. </p> <p>Lynsey Hand at Office nevertheless feels such concern is needless. \"Top designers use the top factories - which we cannot afford - to produce their designs. Certainly no designers have complained to us. Our shoes, in the flesh, are quite different and I'm sure the big designers know that.\" </p> <p>Treacy and Guinness disagree. \"It hurts our relationship with our stockists,\" Macfarlane explains. \"They are inevitably unhappy that copies of our products are available just down the road at lower prices.\" </p> <p>There is one designer, however, whose view differs. At a recent lecture in London, Tom Ford was asked how he felt about high street versions of his lavish clothes. With characteristic financial pragmatism, Ford replied: \"I love it - and I want to hire those designers.\"</p>",

Across more than half a century, he produced some of the finest, most memorable poems in recent Iranian history, and played an important role in the modernisation of Persian poetry, developing new techniques that gave greater flight to his imagination.</p> <p>He was also a professional journalist, earning most of his living by editing literary and political magazines. He was a critic, scholar, translator, scriptwriter and - with his beautiful voice - a gifted reciter of poetry. As a lifelong campaigner for freedom of expression, he was several times jailed by the Shah's regime and vilified by the subsequent Islamic government.</p> <p>Shamlu published nearly 20 collections of poetry. His work set him apart, even in a country with a rich poetic heritage, where poetry is widely read, memorised and used in daily conversation.</p> <p>Born in Tehran, his life and work reflected Iran's turbulent history from the second world war to the Islamic revolution of the late 1970s. He grew up in various cities, as his family followed the postings of his army officer father. He did not finish high school, he explained later, because he was thirsty to read and understand - and he was getting nothing from school. From an early age, he was an avid reader and a concerned observer of the misery and suffering around him.</p> <p>The allied occupation of Iran, towards the end of the second world war, inspired Shamlu's first patriotic po ems. At 18, he was held in an allied prison for a year, for distributing anti-occupation pamphlets. Shortly after his release, he was arrested again - together with his father - by the separatist local government of Azerbaijan. They were left waiting for execution in front of a firing squad for hours before being freed.</p> <p>After the war, like many young Iranian intellectuals, Shamlu joined the Tudeh (communist) party, and his poetry of this period reflected his politics. His first collection of poems, The Forgotten Songs, was published in 1947, when he was 22; it was followed, in 1951, by Manifesto. After Mohammed Mussadeq's nationalist and liberal government was overthrown in 1953 by an Anglo-American backed coup, Shamlu was again imprisoned. Once released, he left the Tudeh party and never again joined a political organisation.</p> <p>Shamlu's style of poetry was influenced by two sources. He was fascinated by Nima Yushij, generally regarded as the father of Iran's \"new poetry\", and by a variety of foreign poets: the French Paul Eluard and Louis Aragon, the Russian Vladimir Mayakovsky, the American Langston Hughes and, above all, the Spaniard Federico Garcia Lorca.</p> <p>The publication of The Fresh Air (1957) established him as a prominent poet. His verse was full of hope and he saw himself as the heart of the revolution: \"Come/ my companion/ with your pains/ and trickle the poison of your pains/ into the wound of my heart/ I am the common pain/ cry me out\".</p> <p>In the wake of Mussadeq's overthrow, however, political repression gradually created despair and pessimism among Iranian intellectuals, a mood reflected in Shamlu's works of the period: Aida In Mirror (1964), Aida: The Tree, The Dagger And A Memory, and Phoenix In The Rain (1966).</p> <p>Aida was the name of Shamlu's second wife, who he met in the early 1960s and who remained his companion for the rest of his life. In these collections, love became his main preoccupation, replacing his belief in the masses. Jesus, and the indifference of the people towards his suffering, was also a new theme for his poetry.</p> <p>In Abraham In The Fire (1973), Shamlu's pessimism reached a new height, when he beautifully portrayed a lifeless Iranian society: \"There is no door/ There is no road/ There is no night/ There is no moon/ Neither day/ Nor sun/ We are standing outside time/ With a bitter dagger/ Stuck in our spine/ No one talks to anyone/ For silence is speaking in a thousand tongues.\"</p> <p>Harassed by the authorities, and unable to tolerate the oppressive atmosphere of Iran, Shamlu left for the United States in 1977, and later moved to Britain to edit Iranshahr, a popular, anti-Shah, Persian-language newspaper. When he returned home after the Shah was overthrown, he found the Islamic regime just as hostile. He warned in the first issue of his new weekly, Ketab-e Jumeh, that black days were ahead and, in his powerful poem, In This Dead-End, he depicted the atmosphere of fear and repression in post-revolutionary Iran.</p> <p>Shamlu published a few other collections of poems before the regime banned his work.

      "body": "<p>Granada Media was last night close to finalising a deal which would see it emerge as the dominant player in the ITV network. The company could announce an agreement as early as this morning which will see it buying the Meridian and Anglia franchises owned by Lord Hollick's United News &amp; Media. </p> <p>There was speculation that Granada was working on a deal to acquire all three of United's licences, including HTV, but it would be required to sell one on to satisfy demands made by the regulators. The likely outcome is that HTV, the Welsh franchise, will end up in the hands of Carlton Communications, leaving the lion's share of ITV controlled by two companies. </p> <p>The agreement will be a triumph for Charles Allen, the Granada Media chief executive who had to fight back after an attempt by his two ITV rivals to merge - a deal which would have left Granada as the minority player. </p> <p>Mr Allen has long maintained that there will eventually be a single company running ITV and has made no secret of his ambitions to be at the helm. </p> <p>Granada already owns the Yorkshire, Tyne Tees, LWT and Granada franchises as well as being the ITV network's most prolific programme maker. Its productions include Coronation Street, Emmerdale and Cold Feet. </p> <p>Carlton owns the London Weekday, West Country and Central licences. </p> <p>United raised the \"for sale\" sign over its ITV interests after its hoped-for \u00a310bn merger with Carlton ran foul of competition authorities. The deal was approved only on condition that United dispose of its Meridian licence on the south coast which accounted for half the group's revenues from ITV. </p> <p>Carlton subsequently pulled out of the deal leaving Lord Hollick, who is a Labour peer, with few options. </p> <p>Shares in United closed 15p lower at 945p yesterday as investors resigned themselves to the prospect that there would not be a takeover premium for the entire group. </p> <p>Granada Media was trading 15p lower at 585p and Carlton was up 5p at 823.5p. </p> <p>There was also a question mark still hanging over the 35% stake in Channel 5 owned by United. </p> <p>A deal is expected to be agreed to sell the share in that broadcaster to pan-European television group RTL, which already owns the remaining 65%. </p> <p>Under takeover panel rules Granada has until Friday of next week to declare its hand after it was given the green light to bid for either United or Carlton by trade secretary Stephen Byers two weeks ago. </p> <p>Broadcasting regulations mean that no single company is allowed to control more than 15% of the total television audience share but that limit is expected to be swept aside by the communications white paper due for publication in the autumn. A single ITV could then become a possibility once legislation is passed after the general election. </p> <p>The sale of United's TV assets will throw the focus on the remainder of the trimmed-down media concern. </p> <p>There have long been suggestions that the Daily Express and Sunday Express newspapers would find no shortage of buyers if Lord Hollick decided to sell.</p>",

There was speculation that Granada was working on a deal to acquire all three of United's licences, including HTV, but it would be required to sell one on to satisfy demands made by the regulators. The likely outcome is that HTV, the Welsh franchise, will end up in the hands of Carlton Communications, leaving the lion's share of ITV controlled by two companies. The agreement will be a triumph for Charles Allen, the Granada Media chief executive who had to fight back after an attempt by his two ITV rivals to merge - a deal which would have left Granada as the minority player. Mr Allen has long maintained that there will eventually be a single company running ITV and has made no secret of his ambitions to be at the helm. Granada already owns the Yorkshire, Tyne Tees, LWT and Granada franchises as well as being the ITV network's most prolific programme maker. Its productions include Coronation Street, Emmerdale and Cold Feet. Carlton owns the London Weekday, West Country and Central licences. United raised the \"for sale\" sign over its ITV interests after its hoped-for \u00a310bn merger with Carlton ran foul of competition authorities. The deal was approved only on condition that United dispose of its Meridian licence on the south coast which accounted for half the group's revenues from ITV. Carlton subsequently pulled out of the deal leaving Lord Hollick, who is a Labour peer, with few options. Shares in United closed 15p lower at 945p yesterday as investors resigned themselves to the prospect that there would not be a takeover premium for the entire group. Granada Media was trading 15p lower at 585p and Carlton was up 5p at 823.5p. There was also a question mark still hanging over the 35% stake in Channel 5 owned by United. A deal is expected to be agreed to sell the share in that broadcaster to pan-European television group RTL, which already owns the remaining 65%. Under takeover panel rules Granada has until Friday of next week to declare its hand after it was given the green light to bid for either United or Carlton by trade secretary Stephen Byers two weeks ago. Broadcasting regulations mean that no single company is allowed to control more than 15% of the total television audience share but that limit is expected to be swept aside by the communications white paper due for publication in the autumn. A single ITV could then become a possibility once legislation is passed after the general election. The sale of United's TV assets will throw the focus on the remainder of the trimmed-down media concern. There have long been suggestions that the Daily Express and Sunday Express newspapers would find no shortage of buyers if Lord Hollick decided to sell.",

Yesterday, the NHS plan shifted that central accountability away from the government's corridors of power and out into hospital wards, GPs' surgeries, local authorities' chambers and even the patient's home. </p> <p>Setting out its vision, the government said its plan was to build a health service for the 21st century, one that was designed around the needs of the patient. It wanted a \"leaner more focused centre with the secretary of state devolving powers\", and aimed to offer fast and convenient care delivered to a consistently high standard, with services that were tailored to people's individual needs. </p> <p>\"Our vision is of an NHS where staff are not rushed off their feet and constantly exhausted; where careers are developed not stagnant; where staff are paid properly for good performance; and where child care is provided in every hospital,\" said the NHS plan. </p> <p>\"Ours is a vision of a renewed public service ethos, a system that values the dedication of staff and believes that trust is still the glue that binds the NHS together.\" </p> <p>The top-down, dropped bedpan model \"failed to provide the local innovation, and the responsiveness to deliver sustained improvements in patient care\". </p> <p>The government admitted that it would take time to realise its vision, but said that over the next 10 years the NHS must be redesigned to be patient centred. It said that the task for the plan was to show how to bridge the gulf between the reality of the NHS today and the vision of what it should be like tomorrow. </p> <p> <b> What's wrong with the NHS?</b> </p> <p> In his introduction to the report, the secretary of state for health, Alan Milburn, said that today's NHS was not sufficiently designed around the convenience and concerns of the patient. </p> <p>\"The NHS provides many patients with a good and reliable service. But it is simply not responsive enough to their needs,\" he said. \"Patients have to wait too long for treatment. Records get lost. Wards are not clean. Standards are too variable. Old-fashioned demarcations between staff, restricted opening and operating times, outdated systems, unnecessarily complex procedures and a lack of training all combine to create a culture where the convenience of the patient can come a poor second to the convenience of the system.\" </p> <p>The report said that the NHS was a 1940s system operating in a 21st century world. It criticised old-fashioned demarcations between staff which meant some patients saw a procession of health professionals to whom they often had to recount the same details. Information was not shared and investigations were often repeated. </p> <p>The report said the fault line between health and social care which had existed since the service was created in 1948 had inhibited the development of services shaped around the needs of patients. </p> <p>It criticised the NHS for doing too little to prevent ill health in the first place. \"The health gap between the better off and the worst off in society has widened in the last 50 years. The gap between health need and health services remains stubbornly wide.\" </p> <p>The relationship between service and patient was too hierarchical and paternalistic. The NHS was also criticised for inadequate levels of modern equipment, and IT investment had been \"too slow and too patchy\". </p> <p> <b> What will happen in the future?</b> </p> <p> The public's main concern about the NHS was waiting times, and the plan said that these would be cut. </p> <p>\"The traditional waiting list for surgery will become a thing of the past. There will be waits of weeks rather than months. The uncertainty of not knowing when your operation will happen will be replaced by the certainty of a booked date.\" </p> <p>The government said that, by the end of 2005, waiting lists for hospital appointments and admission would be abolished and replaced with booking systems. The maximum waiting time for an out-patient appointment would be three months, and for in-patients, six months. It was hoped that by 2008 the maximum wait for treatment would be cut to three months and 75% of operations would be carried out on a day-care basis. By 2004 patients would be able to have a GP appointment within 48 hours. </p> <p>As a result of the plan, there will be 7000 extra NHS beds by 2004 along with a substantial investment in NHS buildings. Between now and 2004 there will be 7,000 more consultants, 2,000 more GPs, 20,000 more nurses, and over 6,500 more therapists and other health professionals. </p> <p> <b> Patients</b> </p> <p> The plan said that too many patients felt talked at, rather than listened to, and that this had to change. </p> <p>A patient would have the right to fair access and high standards wherever they lived. They would have greater power and possession of their illness, their choice would be strengthened and they would have more rights. Eventually they would have smart cards containing medical records. These electronic patient records would enable nurses, therapists and doctors to maintain continuity of care and knowledge of patients. </p> <p>Appointments would be pre-booked to suit the patient, and tests and diagnosis would be carried out on the same day. Patients would have proper redress when operations were cancelled and would have access to patients advocates and advisers, a service that would be set up in every hospital. </p> <p>By 2001, the patients' charter would be replaced by the NHS charter, which clarified the NHS commitment to patients and their rights. </p> <p> <b> Better, faster services</b> </p> <p> The plan said that waiting times in accident and emergency departments would be drastically reduced; no one should wait more than four hours and most should be seen within 75 minutes. The proposal meant big changes to the way casualty departments worked, and patients with minor injuries would often be treated by nurse practitioners. </p> <p>The role of NHS Direct would increase to try to unplug choked areas of the system, particularly accident and emergency departments. The plan said: \"By 2004 a single call to NHS Direct will be a one-stop gateway to out of hours healthcare, passing on calls, where necessary.\" </p> <p>The government promised better out of hours pharmacy services and to make available a wider range of over the counter medicines. </p> <p> <b> Newer, cleaner hospitals and better food</b> </p> <p> The government promised to build a new generation of state of the art hospitals with more intimate ward bays or rooms rather than the old style Nightingale wards. Eventually each patient would have their own television and telephone. </p> <p>Over \u00a330m would be allocated immediately to hospital trusts to improve hospital cleaning, and a nationwide clean-up campaign would start immediately. All patient areas, visitor toilets, outpatients and accident and emergency units would be thoroughly cleaned and maintained. Each hospital would have an unannounced inspection of its cleanliness in the next six months, and the results would be made public. </p> <p>The plan said that the NHS provided more than 300m meals each year and the food was \"variable in quality, is not provided in a way which is sufficiently responsive to patients, and too much of it is wasted as a result\". </p> <p>By 2001, there would be a 24-hour NHS catering service with a new menu designed by leading chefs. Half of all hospitals would have new \"ward housekeepers\" in place by 2004 who would ensure the quality of meals and that patients were able to eat them. An extra \u00a310m would be provided for improvements in hospital food. </p> <p> <b> Better pay</b> </p> <p> Improvements would be made in pay for NHS staff, the plan said. There would be more help with accommodation costs, and the concept of staff hotels would be evaluated. </p> <p>The national recruitment campaign would be extended, and the way NHS employers treated their staff would be linked to the financial resources they received. Every NHS Trust would receive \u00a325,000 to be spent on improving the working environment for staff, and childcare provision would also be increased. </p> <p> <b> Changing role of health department</b> </p> <p> The role of the department would change so that it would champion the interests of patients by applying both pressure and support. </p> <p>By 2004, there would be a new relationship between the government and the NHS and devolution would have taken hold. The same year, the share of NHS spend on management costs would be cut so that a higher share of every pound went into frontline patient care. </p> <p> <b> Consultants</b> </p> <p> A move from a consultant-led to a consultant-delivered service would provide a clear career structure for doctors. Contracts would be overhauled; the issue of consultants' private practice would be addressed and performances would be reviewed; and two-thirds of consultants would get a superannuable bonus. The financial reward to new consultants would be increased, but they would not be allowed to take up private work for seven years. </p> <p> <b> Nurses</b> </p> <p> Nurses would be empowered to undertake a wider range of clinical tasks, including the right to make and receive referrals, admit and discharge patients, order investigations and diagnostic tests and run clinics and prescribe drugs. </p> <p>By 2001, 23,000 nurses would be able to prescribe a limited range of medicines. Staff would be given training if they wanted to take on new roles. Support staff would each have access to \u00a3150 from a learning account. </p> <p> <b> Cancer</b> </p> <p> The plan stated that the provision of extra investment, improved prevention and changed ways of working would mean that cancer services would improve. It would invest an extra \u00a3570m by 2003-04. The breast screening programme would be extended from ages 50-64 to ages 65-70. Cervical cancer screening would be upgraded, and there would be an expansion in cancer screening drugs. An end would be brought to the postcode lottery in the prescribing of cancer drugs. </p> <p> <b> Coronary heart disease</b> </p> <p> A \u00a3230m investment by 2003-04 would be accompanied by the establishment of rapid access chest pain clinics across the country. Clot-busting drugs would be available within an hour of calling for professional help, and ambulance response times would be improved. </p> <p> <b> New equipment</b> </p> <p> New equipment would also be introduced: 50 magnetic resonance imaging cancer scanners; 200 CT cancer scanners; 80 liquid cytology units to improve cervical cancer screening; 450 new and replacement kidney dialysis machines and 3000 automated defibrillators, which would be placed in public places. Up to date information technology systems would be introduced for which the NHS Plan would provide an extra \u00a3250m by 2003-04. </p> <p> <b> Modernisation and scrutiny</b> </p> <p> A modernisation agency would be created to help local clinicians and managers redesign local services around the needs and convenience of patients. </p> <p>The NHS would be made subject to independent scrutiny, and local government would also be given power of scrutiny. </p> <p> <b> Concordat with the private sector</b> </p> <p> The government plan outlined a concordat for the relationship between the NHS and the private sector, which it said would not compromise the principle underpinning the plan. It said: \"Under our proposals a patient would remain an NHS patient even if they were being treated in the private sector.\" </p> <p> <b> Improving health and reducing inequality</b> </p> <p> The report said that the gap between health needs and health services remained stubbornly wide. The plan aimed to tackle the specific needs of differnt groups as well as disadvantage in all forms. The government would set a target to narrow the gap in infant and early childhood mortality and morbidity between socio-economic groups. By 2002 it would develop a new health poverty index. The plan said that the \"inverse care law\" still applied to too many parts of the country. There would be a new way of distributing resources to address iniquities in poorer areas. </p> <p> <b> Reducing smoking and eating fruit</b> </p> <p> For the first time, a quitting service would be provided on the NHS, with nicotine replacement therapy available on prescription from GPs. </p> <p>A new national school fruit scheme would be introduced, whereby every child in nursery aged four to six would be entitled to a free piece of fruit each school day. This would coincide with a programme to get the public to eat five pieces of fruit or vegetables a day. </p> <p> <b> Mental health</b> </p> <p> Extra investment would bring 500 more secure beds and 1,000 new graduate primary care mental health workers, as well as 500 more community health staff. </p> <p>The plan would also see early intervention to reduce the period of untreated psychosis in young people, with 50 teams established over the next three years. </p> <p>The plan said: \"By 2004 all young people who experience a first episode of psychosis, such as schizophrenia, will receive the early and intensive support they need.\" </p> <p> <b> Support for carers</b> </p> <p> By 2004, there would be 7,000 more staff recruited to provide relief to carers and reduce the risk of social isolation. </p> <p><b>New health targets</b></p> <p> \u0095 Maximum waiting time for an operation to fall from 18 months to six months by 2005 and to three months by 2008 </p> <p>\u0095 Maximum waiting time for outpatient appointments to fall to three months by 2005 </p> <p>\u0095 Maximum waiting time at accident and emergency to fall to four hours by 2004. Average should fall to 75 minutes </p> <p>\u0095 If an operation is cancelled on the day of surgery for non-clinical reasons, the hospital will have to rearrange for a date within 28 days. Or it must pay for the patient to go private at time and hospital of patient's choice </p> <p> \u0095 Maximum waiting time to see a GP will fall to 48 hours and to see a primary care professional to 24 hours by 2004</p>",

      "body": "<p>Tony Blair yesterday staked the political credibility of a second Labour term in government on a five-year plan to slash NHS waiting times and create a patient-friendly health service to suit the consumerist values of the 21st century. </p> <p>He promised to recruit 7,500 more consultants by 2005, along with 2,000 extra GPs, more than 20,000 extra nurses and at least 6,750 more therapists and other health professionals. </p> <p>The national plan for health in England will create 7,000 extra NHS beds by 2004, including the first increase in numbers of general and acute wards for nearly 30 years. Modernisation of primary care will include the creation of 500 one-stop centres, combining GPs, dentists, opticians and other health care and social care professionals under one roof. </p> <p>The investment will be supported by a 35% real terms increase in NHS resources over four years - double the historic trend of growth in health spending. Ministers said lack of money was no longer the problem and the key tests of delivery would now be how fast they can recruit trained staff and how well they can retain them. </p> <p>The plan is specific enough in its objectives to create many hostages to Labour's fortune if the NHS does not deliver. </p> <p>Mr Blair told MPs: \"By 2005 the maximum waiting time for an outpatient will be three months and for an in-patient six months, rather than the present 18 months.\" </p> <p>Average waiting times would be cut from seven to five weeks for outpatients and from three months to seven weeks for operations. The eventual objective \"is to get the maximum waiting time for any stage of treatment down to three months by the end of 2008\". Other targets include a commitment that by 2002 all patients will be able to see a primary care professional within 24 hours and a GP within two days. </p> <p>Alan Milburn, the health secretary, said the 144-page national plan was \"the most fundamental and far-reaching reform programme\", addressing every one of the problems facing the NHS. \"From the state of the wards to the doctor's contract, not one issue has been ducked.\" </p> <p>The proposals include steps to break down the boundaries between the health professions, expanding the responsibilities of nurses, midwives and therapists. </p> <p>Changes for NHS doctors will include a new consultants' contract linked to annual appraisal of their work. Newly qualified consultants will be obliged to work exclusively for the NHS for seven years, but after that they will be allowed to undertake private practice in their own time. </p> <p>There will be a nationwide clean-up campaign of wards and six-monthly undercover inspections of hospital cleanliness.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair yesterday staked the political credibility of a second Labour term in government on a five-year plan to slash NHS waiting times and create a patient-friendly health service to suit the consumerist values of the 21st century. He promised to recruit 7,500 more consultants by 2005, along with 2,000 extra GPs, more than 20,000 extra nurses and at least 6,750 more therapists and other health professionals. The national plan for health in England will create 7,000 extra NHS beds by 2004, including the first increase in numbers of general and acute wards for nearly 30 years. Modernisation of primary care will include the creation of 500 one-stop centres, combining GPs, dentists, opticians and other health care and social care professionals under one roof. The investment will be supported by a 35% real terms increase in NHS resources over four years - double the historic trend of growth in health spending. Ministers said lack of money was no longer the problem and the key tests of delivery would now be how fast they can recruit trained staff and how well they can retain them. The plan is specific enough in its objectives to create many hostages to Labour's fortune if the NHS does not deliver. Mr Blair told MPs: \"By 2005 the maximum waiting time for an outpatient will be three months and for an in-patient six months, rather than the present 18 months.\" Average waiting times would be cut from seven to five weeks for outpatients and from three months to seven weeks for operations. The eventual objective \"is to get the maximum waiting time for any stage of treatment down to three months by the end of 2008\". Other targets include a commitment that by 2002 all patients will be able to see a primary care professional within 24 hours and a GP within two days. Alan Milburn, the health secretary, said the 144-page national plan was \"the most fundamental and far-reaching reform programme\", addressing every one of the problems facing the NHS. \"From the state of the wards to the doctor's contract, not one issue has been ducked.\" The proposals include steps to break down the boundaries between the health professions, expanding the responsibilities of nurses, midwives and therapists. Changes for NHS doctors will include a new consultants' contract linked to annual appraisal of their work. Newly qualified consultants will be obliged to work exclusively for the NHS for seven years, but after that they will be allowed to undertake private practice in their own time. There will be a nationwide clean-up campaign of wards and six-monthly undercover inspections of hospital cleanliness. Hospitals will be set tough performance targets linked to extra cash and those who fail will be taken over and run by a management hit squad. Early reaction from the NHS professions, managers and patients suggested there would be strong support for the general direction of reform, but months of in-fighting over the detail. The plan included a preface signed by 25 leaders of organisations on which its delivery will depend, welcoming its \"direction of travel\". They included representatives of the British Medical Association, Royal College of Nursing and the NHS Confederation, representing the managers. But Peter Hawker, chairman of the BMA consultants committee, said proposals for changing the consultants contract showed \"profound lack of understanding of the work they do\". After two years of discussion, the government's only new idea was \"an ill-conceived, vindictive attack on new consultants' freedom to work outside the NHS\". There was also bitter disappointment among organisations representing older people about the government's decision to reject the royal commission's recommendation that the NHS should pay for personal care in residential homes.

Dozens of people in rows, sitting around for hours to be told by a doctor that really there is very little wrong with them: the ankle they thought was broken is simply a sprain; the cut on the finger that does not need stitches but a plaster. It is a bit of a relief, but it is also a waste of time - for patient and doctor alike. </p> <p>On Friday night in the Medway Maritime hospital in Gillingham, Kent, the high temperature outside the automatic doors of the accident and emergency department is reflected in the fractious tempers of those waiting inside. Much like any casualty department, this one operates a system where those with minor injuries must wait. </p> <p>The two flashing red LED signs spell it out: \"Welcome to Medway A&amp;E. The current waiting time for category green patients is 2-3 hours. Patients are seen in order of priority and not in order of arrival. We are sorry for any delay.\" </p> <p>For the patients whose patience has run out, they cannot understand what takes so long. Nursing minor cuts, swollen ankles, bruises, scrapes, torn ligaments and other everyday ailments, they cannot see what more serious injuries and illnesses are being attended to as a matter of priority. </p> <p>Behind the doors of the trolley area - the main reception for patients with major injury, trauma and illness - an elderly man is fitting uncontrollably and as yet, the staff do not know why. A prisoner from one of her majesty's local hostelries is chained to his bed under the watch of two prison officers. A woman is strapped down on to a trolley in case she has suffered a spinal injury. And a very sick baby is crying uncontrollably for an unknown reason. </p> <p>Out in reception, Shelley Smithson, 24, and her dad have been waiting four hours. She has been sent by her GP with a suspected appendicitis and is confused by the need to be assessed by a triage nurse because - in spite of information technology - there is no NHS computer link to her doctor's notes. </p> <p>Looking at the others waiting, her dad, who does not want to be named, says: \"Half of these people don't need to be here to start with. There are people who should be going to their GP, not coming here.\" </p> <p>And that is one of the problems of today's A&amp;E service. </p> <p>It needs to provide everything to all people. From the road traffic accident victim to the woman who calls an ambulance for a cut on her finger. To every casualty department, there are no inappropriate attenders - everyone is welcome, it is just that it might take time to treat some of them. </p> <p>In a report on modernisation of A&amp;E submitted in April to Alan Milburn, the health secretary, an A&amp;E consultant at Norfolk and Norwich hospital, Mike Lambert, said there should be more consistency in emergency medicine, and a re-education of the public. He suggested people needed to be trained out of their automatic instinct to head straight to casualty. </p> <p>\"We have to improve patients' knowledge of how the system works. I believe that in five to 10 years time, people will use a combination of NHS Direct and the ambulance service to determine their needs,\" said Mr Lambert. </p> <p>It is something the government has taken on board. By 2004 it aims to cut average waits to 75 minutes by introducing new working practices. </p> <p>At Medway, the staff know the system needs to be improved, and welcome change. Peter McKenna, the senior nurse manager, said: \"Across the country people keep coming through the doors. I think what we need now is almost a clarification of what the government or the people wants us to do. I don't think it has ever been stated. </p> <p>\"Are they actually going to say 'no, A&amp;E isn't always the place to go'? Everyone is still frightened to say 'this is not where you should be'. There is a debate, but it's almost circular.\" </p> <p>While the work of A&amp;E is focused on the seriously ill and injured, those who require immediate attention account for less than 10% of the department's workload. At Medway, 16-20% of patients are seen by nurse practitioners who can treat and discharge without the need to see a doctor. It is a practice that is being piloted and researched countrywide. </p> <p>North Tyneside hospital in North Shields was highlighted in yesterday's NHS Plan for piloting a computer system that has slashed A&amp;E waiting times and allowed many patients who can treat themselves to go home after an average wait of 36 minutes. After being assessed by a triage nurse who splits patients off into serious and minor, computer algorithms similar to those of NHS Direct are applied by a nurse, who will either treat and discharge the patient or refer them on to a doctor or, sometimes, back to their GP. </p> <p>The computer allows the nurse to ask questions to help determine the problem. For many patients, a professional ruling out anything seriously wrong is enough. At North Tyneside, 27% of patients are referred to self care. The model is being considered for not just other A&amp;E departments but other parts of the NHS. </p> <p>Sue Page, chief executive of North Tynside NHS trust, explained: \"Last year, all the consultants said 'we have got to sort out A&amp;E, it's crippling us'. We had waiting rooms full of agitated patients, which was manifesting itself in security risks to the staff, particularly on the weekend. Drunks, disturbance - and the longer you had them waiting, the worse it became. We ended up with a base for Northumbra police here. </p> <p>\"Now they walk into an environment which is much like a hotel, and are dealt with quickly. Stress levels amongst the staff have gone down.\" </p> <p>Caroline Angus, a staff nurse trained to use the algorithms, agreed: \"If you look to the old system, patients classed as minor injuries, and waiting for four or five hours, got fed up, frustrated, angry. Who did they take it out on? The nurses. </p> <p>\"This new system means that the turnover is quite quick.\"</p>",

Earlier court decisions had ruled that local education authorities did not owe a duty of care to children with learning difficulties, even if they had been treated negligently, and it was therefore impossible for councils to be sued for damages. The law lords disagreed. Seven law lords agreed that the issue of whether teachers owed a duty of care to all their pupils, and not just those with special needs, was more controversial. But Lord Nicholls said: \"I can see no escape from the conclusion that teachers do, indeed, owe such duties. \"The principal objection raised to this conclusion is the spectre of a rash of gold digging actions brought on behalf of under-achieving children by discontented parents, perhaps years after the events complained of. \"I am not persuaded by these fears. I do not think they provide sufficient reason for treating work in the classroom as territory which the courts must never enter.\" Jack Rabinowicz, the solicitor for Ms Anderton and Mrs Phelps said: \"This is a fundamental statement by the English courts that if mistakes do take place in the education system then teachers and local education authorities can be held liable.\" Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers said the ruling was \"another big step down the slippery path of the suing society\". He added: \"Where will it all end? Will teachers have the right to sue disruptive pupils and their parents for damages? Will schools and teachers have the right to sue the government for failing to provide them with adequate resources to meet all the demands that are now being made upon them?\" Graham Lane, Labour education group leader on the Local government association, said: \"If you sue, you take money out of the authority for today's children - that really is unjust.\" Mrs Phelps said last night that when her dyslexia was discovered, two weeks before she was due to take her GCSEs, teachers at the Mellow Lane School in Hillingdon had not wanted her to sit the exams. She left the school and paid for private tuition. In 1990 she began her legal fight. Mrs Phelps said that she would spend the damages on getting the education that was denied her and put the rest towards schooling her two sons. Ms Anderton, also dyslexic, said that she would be fighting for compensation from Mold LEA for the bullying she had suffered until she was 13, when she was forced to leave Argoed high school. The LEA refused to send her to the Ravenscroft school for dyslexics. When Ms Anderton's family appealed to the Welsh Office, the government allowed her to go there. Lawyers for Marcus Jarvis welcomed the ruling. Mr Jarvis had no formal education after the age of 12 and ended up serving a five year jail sentence for robbery. He had tried to sue Hampshire county council for giving him \"a rotten deal\", but the court of appeal had said that he had no right to sue the authority.",

      "body": "<p>When a fire bomb ripped through the Balmes cinema in Barcelona on July 11 1974, the screening of Carlos Saura's La Prima Angelica (Cousin Angelica) was brought abruptly to a halt. The violent response to Angelica, one of the first films to represent the country's bitter civil war from a republican perspective, emphasised the political importance of cinema that deals with contested historical periods. The civil war may have ended officially in 1939, but fascist fire bombs suggested that the battle for Spain's fractured past was set to continue. </p> <p>The release of Jose Luis Cuerda's La Lengua de las Mariposas (Butterfly's Tongue) once again brings the Spanish civil war into the cinema. Set in Galicia in the months preceding Franco's fascist uprising in July 1936, it traces the relationship between a seven-year-old boy and his anarchist-leaning teacher.</p> <p>The film is indicative of Spanish cinema's concern with the country's recent past; of the nearly 300 historical films produced in Spain since the 1970s, more than half are set during the second republic, the civil war and under Franco. A period of 40-odd years, from 1931 to 1975, has become a rich historical seam for Spanish film-makers to mine as Spain struggles to come to terms with a past that had previously been refracted through a right-wing lens. </p> <p>Under the dictatorship of General Francisco Franco, Spanish cinema was utilised as a myth-making machine to spin stories about the past. Cinema became a propaganda tool as the government turned out cine cruzada, or civil-war films, which venerated the Church, the family and the fascist state. The only cinematic version of history permitted, cine cruzada is best exemplified by the 1941 film Raza (Race), a triumphalist account of the war based on a script by the victorious dictator himself. It encapsulates the attitude of those in power: they had won the war, now they needed to win the history. </p> <p>Even foreign films favourable to a republican viewpoint, such as the 1943 version of Ernest Hemingway's novel For Whom the Bell Tolls, were refused distribution. Facing the sharp scissors of the censor, oppositional film-makers who remained in the country utilised allusion, metaphor and symbolism in an attempt to raise alternative historical accounts of the past.</p> <p>But from within these artistic strictures emerged two of the most acclaimed films to touch on the conflict: Saura's 1965 film La Caza (The Hunt) and Victor Erice's classic expressionist work from 1973, El Espiritu de la Colmena (Spirit of the Beehive). Set in the period following the conflict, both films deny easy interpretation, but many of those Spaniards fortunate enough to have seen them in cinemas at the time viewed them as harsh condemnations of the regime. </p> <p>A recurring theme in Saura's work is the problems associated with re-capturing a long-suppressed past through recourse to memory. This is evident in Cousin Angelica which recalls the war from the perspective of a child of republican parents. Similarly, Saura's 1970 film, El Jardin de las Delicias (The Garden of Delights), relates the story of an amnesiac businessman whose peseta-chasing family attempt to force him to recollect his financial transactions. After years of cinematic distortion of history, Saura's films raise crucial questions about the vital necessity of remembering the past; yet, simultaneously, they point to the inherent fallibility of human memory itself. </p> <p>After Franco's death in 1975 and the subsequent relaxation of censorship laws, cinematic representations of the war changed beyond all recognition. Over the following two and a half decades, events that were previously referred to obliquely took centre-stage in Spanish cinema. </p> <p>In the years immediately following the dictator's demise, some film-makers turned towards documentary in a direct attempt to recuperate this repressed historical period. In 1977 La vieja memoria (The Old Memory) was released - an experimental documentary directed by Jaime Camino that utilises eyewitness testimonies from a wide range of veterans of the conflict. It seeks the \"truth\" of the past, but a different type of \"truth\" from the monolithic accounts characteristic of Francoist cinema. By presenting conflicting, subjective versions of the same period, The Old Memory moves from a documentary style to a more open-ended narrative that invites a plurality of response. </p> <p>The same year saw another landmark documentary, Por Que Perdimos la Guerra? (Why Did We Lose the War?), directed by Diego Santillan, the son of a wartime anarchist leader, which presents a series of interviews with sympathisers of the anarchist trade union, the CNT. Fiercely critical of the British and French governments' refusal to sell arms to the beleaguered republic, the film also takes a bitter swipe at Stalin and the Spanish Communist Party (PCE).</p> <p>With more than a little justification, Santillan suggests that Stalin was keener to establish a pact with fascism than to further the revolutionary uprising that had prevented Franco's immediate seizure of power. Both these documentaries marked a new stage in representations of the conflict, but the appeal of documentary cinema was relatively short-lived and Spanish film-makers mainly utilised fictional cinema to deal with the past. </p> <p>In 1985, Luis Garcia Berlanga's La Vaquilla (The Little Cow) was released. Set on the Aragon front during the war, the significance of the film stems from its status as one of the first comedies set during that period. In that sense it foreshadows two of the films best known to foreign audiences: Fernando Trueba's Oscar-winning Belle Epoque (1993) and Saura's Ay, Carmela! (1990). </p> <p>Set on the cusp of the establishment of the second republic and the abdication of the monarchy in April 1931, the world created in Belle Epoque is a million miles removed from the lived experience of rural life in 1930s Spain. The film creates an imaginary world where no one worries about work or money, where there is an abundance of good food and wine, and where personal freedom is closely identified with sexual liberation - a world that is in the process of shaking off the repressive force of the Catholic church and where people can begin to live their lives free from patriarchal restrictions. </p> <p>As with Butterfly's Tongue, this is sugar-coated history. Republican Spain seen through rose-tinted glasses; a harsh and bitter world, magically transformed into an idyllic pre-modern utopia about to be cruelly crushed by fascism. There is a refusal to engage with a concrete historical past, and what is presented in both films is a nostalgic recreation of a republican Spain that never was. These two films highlight the fact that right-wing myths of the past are slowly being undone but they are being replaced with myths of a different kind. </p> <p>If both Belle Epoque and Butterfly's Tongue recreate romanticised worlds, Ay Carmela! presents a different image of Spain altogether. Set in 1938, when the republic looked defeated, Carmela and her compatriots are performers in a republican theatre company who are captured by Franco's troops and faced with the dilemma of whether to perform before a group of fascist soldiers.</p> <p>Saura uses the situation to present a meditation on questions dealing with artistic and cultural freedom: how much is it possible to compromise in the face of censorship and dictatorial control? What do you do in the face of inevitable doom? These are undoubtedly questions of specific relevance to those who struggled to make films under the dictatorship, but they also raise questions about the here and now, and indicate how the civil war is visited to comment on the concerns of the present. </p> <p>It was not only Spanish films that entered the battle over Spain's past. Ken Loach's Land and Freedom was released in 1995 amidst a flurry of critical praise and political debate. Using as its starting point George Orwell's classic autobiographical account, Homage to Catalonia, Land and Freedom focuses on the bitter internal struggles within the republican movement that assisted the fascists' victory. </p> <p>Like Why Did We Lose the War?, by re-examining the debates over the need for a revolutionary war to defeat Franco, Loach attempts to rehabilitate the war's revolutionary dimensions, suggesting that the conflict was more than a simple struggle between fascism and democracy. The closing slow-motion shooting of Blanca, a metaphorical representation of the betrayal of the revolution by the Spanish communists, caused bitter controversy and kick-started a reappraisal of the conflict inside Spain. </p> <p>The furore provoked by Land and Freedom confirms the importance of cinematic images to contemporary audiences' understanding of the past. Like it or not, as the importance of the written word is steadily replaced by the immediacy of the visual image, cinema will increasingly become an arena for the contestation of differing versions of history. </p> <p>Currently in pre-production, Antonio Banderas is preparing to direct Malaga Burning!, an adaptation of a 1937 novel set in his hometown in 1936. We wait with bated breath to see what myths will be created - or exploded - when Hollywood gets its hands on the Spanish civil war.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong> American Beauty</strong><br>Rental <br>Universal Pictures Cert 18 <br> *****</p> <p>A US film so fresh, light, personal and full of ideas, you'd think you were back in the early 70s. It's a long time since anything was more deserving of its raft of Oscars - these are the people, remember, who gave six doorstops to Forrest Gump.</p> <p>American Beauty is brilliantly assembled by first-time director Sam Mendes, teasingly scripted by Alan Ball (also a first after bill-paying TV work on Cybill and Grace Under Fire) and nicely acted all round; and Tim Newman's mood-changing score hasn't had as much praise as it deserves. But most of all, it features a towering performance from the sultan of sly, Kevin Spacey.</p> <p>Spacey's henpecked worm turn is a thing of joy. When he falls in lust on seeing Mena Suvari's precocious cheerleader, he does the opposite of the traditional tongue-lolling approach but it works a treat; when he hits back at Annette Bening's tightly wound aspirational wife, he's quiet but sharp as a stiletto - hear the loathing behind the carefully enunciated \"bloodless money-grabbing freak\"; when he needs to show tenderness (to Chris Cooper's psychotic military man), he's achingly sensitive.</p> <p>American Beauty is the story of a suburban community where everybody is living a lie and where truth, eventually and tragicomically, will out. It's about liberation and repression and bottled up lives coming spectacularly unravelled. It does its job so well that you could imagine its audience trying to be a little looser and more honest.</p> <p>You could still nitpick a little: I thought Bening was a bit one-dimensional and the \"beauty in a plastic bag\" scene may remind cynical Viz fans irresistibly of the Black Bag strip. But Wes Bentley is a real find and anything that has people bonding across a generation gap (as Bentley and Spacey do) through a shared love of Re-Animator, and has the best \"clean piss\" scene since Withnail and I, gets my vote.

      "bodyText": "American Beauty Rental Universal Pictures Cert 18 ***** A US film so fresh, light, personal and full of ideas, you'd think you were back in the early 70s. It's a long time since anything was more deserving of its raft of Oscars - these are the people, remember, who gave six doorstops to Forrest Gump. American Beauty is brilliantly assembled by first-time director Sam Mendes, teasingly scripted by Alan Ball (also a first after bill-paying TV work on Cybill and Grace Under Fire) and nicely acted all round; and Tim Newman's mood-changing score hasn't had as much praise as it deserves. But most of all, it features a towering performance from the sultan of sly, Kevin Spacey. Spacey's henpecked worm turn is a thing of joy. When he falls in lust on seeing Mena Suvari's precocious cheerleader, he does the opposite of the traditional tongue-lolling approach but it works a treat; when he hits back at Annette Bening's tightly wound aspirational wife, he's quiet but sharp as a stiletto - hear the loathing behind the carefully enunciated \"bloodless money-grabbing freak\"; when he needs to show tenderness (to Chris Cooper's psychotic military man), he's achingly sensitive. American Beauty is the story of a suburban community where everybody is living a lie and where truth, eventually and tragicomically, will out. It's about liberation and repression and bottled up lives coming spectacularly unravelled. It does its job so well that you could imagine its audience trying to be a little looser and more honest. You could still nitpick a little: I thought Bening was a bit one-dimensional and the \"beauty in a plastic bag\" scene may remind cynical Viz fans irresistibly of the Black Bag strip. But Wes Bentley is a real find and anything that has people bonding across a generation gap (as Bentley and Spacey do) through a shared love of Re-Animator, and has the best \"clean piss\" scene since Withnail and I, gets my vote. You'll probably know by now that American Beauty is a kind of rose (cue petals as recurring motif) but here's a Guardian exclusive: the Dancing Spartanettes routine was choreographed by Paula Abdul.

He is on the bridge of his craft, the Andrea Gail, explaining to fellow skipper Linda Greenlaw - played by Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio - just why he loves fishing so much. This is a longish set-piece speech, poignantly reprised in voiceover at the end, about the playful acquaintance with the gulls, the \"throwing a wave to the lighthouse keeper's kid\" as he rounds the point, the freedom of the ocean. </p> <p>His words here are important - especially as almost all the rest of what Clooney has to say is destined to be shouted inaudibly into the driving wind and rain. They are there to reassure us that the agonies and dangers of the swordfisherman's life are not a banal matter of the risks involved in the pursuit of money, but part of the vocation and the tragic romance of the sea. Sadly, there's something in shot the entire time called a \"bilge monitor\". And, as the Andrea Gail fearlessly sails into the mighty, frothing heart of what meteorologists evidently considered to be the worst situation conceivable (what Junger called the perfect storm) this film's bilge monitor goes on the blink. </p> <p>Sebastian Junger's book - part of the 90s publishing industry's tidal wave of user-friendly, single-issue historical books about cod, tulips, longitude-measuring chronometers, etc - was a passionate and compassionate study of seamanship and the weather, detailing a storm in October 1991 of unexampled ferocity, which claimed six lives. </p> <p>There was arguably something a bit precious about Junger calling his little-known event a \"perfect\" storm, with an air of scientific exactitude or aesthetic connoisseurship, as we all know of other natural disasters of tempest and flood which have killed far more than six - are they supposed to be in some way \"imperfect\"? But Junger wins us over with compelling and meticulously researched detail, setting out not merely the human cost of the storm, but its scientific and even philosophical and geo-political dimensions. The storm is the occasion for a deeply felt meditation on humanity's relationship with the elements, what it might be like to die and, by implication, what it is like to live. </p> <p>Petersen's movie chucks all these non-narrative elements overboard. It leaves us with a pretty static story without much in the way of character development or plot complication. Clooney, and not the storm, turns out to be the star, and so there is a great deal of Clooney shouting interminably while two or three guys off camera chuck buckets of water in his face. The purely descriptive burden of the picture boils down to a perpetually thunderstruck TV weatherman played by Chris McDonald (the baritone announcer from Robert Redford's Quiz Show) who is always gasping over his charts and intoning: \"Oh my God! It's HAPPENING! The storms have collided! They are EXPLODING! You're headed right for the middle of the MONSTER!\" </p> <p>No they're not, though. Clooney and his shouting, stubbled crew are sailing right for the middle of some utterly unscary CGI effects, alternating with the miserable low-tech business of wading around in a freezing tank. There is a very strong cast here doing this, with John C Reilly and Mark Wahlberg among Clooney's shipmates, and Janet Wright, Rusty Schwimmer and Karen Allen as the womenfolk left behind to hug each other as the bad news rolls in. And their decent performances are topped off by an outstanding, and moving, funeral oration by Mastrantonio at the film's melancholy end. </p> <p>But the sad fact is that though the storm sequences are long and loud, they are in danger of being drowned out by the sound of snoring from the auditorium. That image from the poster, for example, showing the Andrea Gail toiling up the side of a wave as high as a building, would be terrifying and awe-inspiring - if we didn't expect large white horses and surfers to come over it advertising Guinness. It is not frightening or convincing for a single moment. Never for one second is it possible to believe, really believe, in Clooney or Wahlberg in peril on the sea. </p> <p>In drenched and windswept movies like Petersen's Das Boot, the mighty forces of the sea complicate and intensify human dramas and human conflict. But in The Perfect Storm, there is no compelling story on board; the inter-crew tensions are resolved well before the Beaufort scale cranks upwards, and in any case the focus on this blurs when the movie has to take in the situation of the other vessels and air-sea rescue crews involved. </p> <p>These people are not allowed any back-story and Petersen seems unsure whether they should be given equal dramatic weight as the crew of the Andrea Gail. In Three Kings, Clooney and Wahlberg demonstrated that they could carry a picture as plausibly tough and masculine movie stars, and in the Coen Brothers' forthcoming O Brother Where Art Thou?, Clooney will show that he can cut it as the leading man of a light comedy. But in The Perfect Storm, Clooney, and everyone else, are all at sea.</p>",

That image from the poster, for example, showing the Andrea Gail toiling up the side of a wave as high as a building, would be terrifying and awe-inspiring - if we didn't expect large white horses and surfers to come over it advertising Guinness. It is not frightening or convincing for a single moment. Never for one second is it possible to believe, really believe, in Clooney or Wahlberg in peril on the sea. In drenched and windswept movies like Petersen's Das Boot, the mighty forces of the sea complicate and intensify human dramas and human conflict. But in The Perfect Storm, there is no compelling story on board; the inter-crew tensions are resolved well before the Beaufort scale cranks upwards, and in any case the focus on this blurs when the movie has to take in the situation of the other vessels and air-sea rescue crews involved. These people are not allowed any back-story and Petersen seems unsure whether they should be given equal dramatic weight as the crew of the Andrea Gail. In Three Kings, Clooney and Wahlberg demonstrated that they could carry a picture as plausibly tough and masculine movie stars, and in the Coen Brothers' forthcoming O Brother Where Art Thou?, Clooney will show that he can cut it as the leading man of a light comedy. But in The Perfect Storm, Clooney, and everyone else, are all at sea.",

      "bodyText": "The European Union could admit up to 75m immigrants over the next half-century and must be prepared to become a racially hybrid society, according to a paper drawn up by France. Jean-Pierre Chev\u00e8nement, the French interior minister, produced the document for a meeting of EU ministers in Marseille today. Citizens of the EU should be told, the paper says, that Europe will become an area of \"cross-fertilisation\" ( m\u00e9tissage ). Diplomats expressed surprise at the blunt language of the text, which avoids any suspicion of Anglo-Saxon political correctness to argue that with declining fertility and birthrates, the issue of legal immigration into the EU must be tackled. Mr Chev\u00e8nement, an often outspoken nationalist, created controversy recently when he accused Germany of not having overcome its Nazi past. \"Public opinion must be told clearly that Europe, a land of immigration, will become a place where cross-fertilisation occurs,\" says the document. M\u00e9tissage also translates as cross-breeding. \"Public opinion needs to be enlightened and convinced, and more so in countries of recent immigration than others.\" But it adds: \"To allow access is not to renounce all forms of control. Ensuring cross-fertilisation requires a careful and controlling hand, in immigration terms.\" Mr Chev\u00e8nement is in effect issuing a wake-up call to governments to consider resuming what demographers call \"primary migration\", encouraging the entry of economic job hunters who intend to stay and bring their families. But the French minister anticipated that \"a reasonable policy of integration\" that brought in 50m to 75m immigrants by 2050 would leave unchanged \"the percentage of the population of non-European origin\". Jack Straw, Britain's home secretary, is among those attending today's Marseille meeting, organised by France in its role as holder of the EU's rotating presidency. Illegal immigration is one of the topics. \"We need to look imaginatively at how to meet the legal desire for immigration,\" said a Home Office official in London last night. But the unvarnished French analysis could fuel anti-EU sentiment in Britain, where the government has pledged to keep border controls and crack down on those it deems false asylum-seekers. And across the continent, immigration has fuelled anti-foreigner sentiment in a range of countries including Germany, Sweden and Spain. In Austria the issue has been exploited by the far-right Freedom party led by J\u00f6rg Haider. Fears are widespread of a new influx from Poland and Hungary once they join the EU in coming years. Immigration is an increasing preoccupation for Brussels, but decisions are still made by member states, not the European Commission. The French document is based partly on a recent survey by the UN Population Division. That said the population of the 15 EU countries and countries currently bidding for membership would fall in the next 50 years from 729m to 628m while the world's population would grow from 6bn to 9bn. Immigrants, mostly from developing countries, would be needed to fill the vacuum, the UN report argued. Germany recently illustrated one approach to the problem, calling for the immigration of 20,000 IT specialists from India. Ireland, whose economy is booming, is considering importing some 200,000 skilled workers over seven years.",

The man, 21, who has not been named, is among 31 Afghans from the hijacked plane that landed at Stansted in February who are appealing against an immigration decision not to give them asylum. After arriving in Britain he told the authorities: \"If the worst comes to the worst you will have to kill me and send my body back to Afghanistan.\" An immigration appeals adjudicator was told yesterday that the man had been given 30 lashes for serving women in a tailor's shop, and had been forced to give up his medical studies. He feared he would be beaten if sent back to Kabul. Rejecting his appeal, Judge Herbert Dunn said the man had not proved he would be persecuted on his return and had been on his way home when he boarded the internal flight. The judge is to rule on the other 30 appeals in the next few days. So far only three people from the hijacked plane have been granted asylum.",

      "body": "<p>Evidence was growing last night that the Concorde that crashed on Tuesday suffered a catastrophic failure in two engines, as accident investigators released details of radio conversations with the pilot, Christian Marty, moments before the plane crashed with the loss of 113 lives.</p> <p>The French accident investigation bureau last night said the remains of tyres had been found on the runway at Charles de Gaulle airport, outside Paris. Mr Marty had told the control tower he could not retract the undercarriage.</p> <p>The bureau added that both engines on the port side of the aircraft were in grave difficulty. The pilot told the control tower that engine number two had \"broken down\" and that the adjacent engine lost power twice during the brief flight.</p> <p>The bureau said the inability to retract the plane's undercarriage would have worsened stability problems. This could explain its sudden lurch to the left before it ploughed into a hotel in Gonesse. All 109 people on board killed, along with four on the ground.</p> <p>The finding would appear to take the spotlight off the maintenance crew who worked on the thrust reverser at the rear of engine number two. The device has been at the centre of speculation about the crash.</p> <p>Investigators yesterday decoded data from the two black boxes recovered from the crash site, but said it might be three days before they could pinpoint the cause. A criminal investigation for manslaughter, a legal requirement in France during a fatal accident inquiry, was launched and documents including papers relating to the repair on the thrust reverser have been seized.</p> <p>However, industry experts rejected what they called unfounded speculation that a last-minute repair caused the disaster. They stressed that none of the elite team of Concorde mechanics had been suspended and argued that a malfunction of the thrust reverser could not have caused the engine to disintegrate and spark such a calamitous fire.

      "bodyText": "Evidence was growing last night that the Concorde that crashed on Tuesday suffered a catastrophic failure in two engines, as accident investigators released details of radio conversations with the pilot, Christian Marty, moments before the plane crashed with the loss of 113 lives. The French accident investigation bureau last night said the remains of tyres had been found on the runway at Charles de Gaulle airport, outside Paris. Mr Marty had told the control tower he could not retract the undercarriage. The bureau added that both engines on the port side of the aircraft were in grave difficulty. The pilot told the control tower that engine number two had \"broken down\" and that the adjacent engine lost power twice during the brief flight. The bureau said the inability to retract the plane's undercarriage would have worsened stability problems. This could explain its sudden lurch to the left before it ploughed into a hotel in Gonesse. All 109 people on board killed, along with four on the ground. The finding would appear to take the spotlight off the maintenance crew who worked on the thrust reverser at the rear of engine number two. The device has been at the centre of speculation about the crash. Investigators yesterday decoded data from the two black boxes recovered from the crash site, but said it might be three days before they could pinpoint the cause. A criminal investigation for manslaughter, a legal requirement in France during a fatal accident inquiry, was launched and documents including papers relating to the repair on the thrust reverser have been seized. However, industry experts rejected what they called unfounded speculation that a last-minute repair caused the disaster. They stressed that none of the elite team of Concorde mechanics had been suspended and argued that a malfunction of the thrust reverser could not have caused the engine to disintegrate and spark such a calamitous fire. The mechanics involved in the repair are said to be receiving psychiatric help. Flight AF4590 took off more than an hour late after Mr Marty insisted on the repair after a fault had been reported on a flight from New York the previous day. The plane took off shortly before 4pm but flames began shooting from its left engines even before it had left the runway. Raymond Auffray, an aeronautical engineer who was responsible for Concorde's certification nearly 25 years ago, said the only engine problem capable of causing such destruction would be a failure of the engine's turbine discs. \"If [a turbine disc failure] happens, everything would be destroyed in its path, including the turbine of the neighbouring engine and all the hydraulic controls,\" he said. \"It does seem that the pilot was first and foremost having to fight with the controls.\" The last of the bodies were recovered from the crash site yesterday, most are burned beyond recognition. Officials said the identification process, by DNA or dental records, was slow and laborious. A minute's silence was observed at the three Paris airports at 5.30 pm yesterday as an ecumenical memorial service attended by the German foreign minister Joshka Fischer and senior members of the French government began at the ornate Madeleine church in the city centre. Air France, which declined to comment on the progress of the investigation, announced it would pay an advance of \u00a314,000 to relatives \"for their immediate material needs\" and also pay for funerals and any counselling required. Bernard Maugis, a CGT union representative and Concorde mechanic, said that in 30 years he had never seen human error during an aircraft repair lead to an accident. \"Planes are repaired before take off every day, all over the world,\" he said. \"The rules are extremely strict and do not depend on the airline concerned. Every repair is checked at several levels.\" The mayor of Gonesse, Jean-Pierre Blazy, who has led the town's battle against night flights over their homes, said a silent march would be held through the streets this afternoon in remembrance of the victims. He also threatened legal action against Air France for compensation on behalf of the town. \u0095 Additional reporting by Amy Lodge",

She specialises in espionage and speaks seven languages, including Arabic,\" he alleged.</p> <p>On the subject of Mr Bin Laden, the Taliban's reclusive leader, Mullah Omar, said he refused to give in to US pressure to surrender the suspected terrorist. The Taliban regard Mr Bin Laden as a hero for his help in bankrolling the guerrilla fight against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s.

      "bodyText": "The Taliban launched a new magazine yesterday which styled the movement as \"a simple band of rural youths\" and quoted its leader as saying that despite the threat of new sanctions against Afghanistan, he would never hand over Osama bin Laden to face terrorism charges in the west. In another article, headlined \"Confessions of an Arab spy\", a Syrian man, 22, claimed to have been sent to infiltrate the Taliban in February on behalf of US and Israeli intelligence agencies. He said he was blackmailed by a recruiter with money and sex after being \"strongly affected\" one night while in the United Arab Emirates watching a Sony PlayStation game. He said he was told that his contact in Pakistan would be a woman named Florence at the US embassy in Islamabad. \"She was described to me as a fat woman who wears glasses. She specialises in espionage and speaks seven languages, including Arabic,\" he alleged. On the subject of Mr Bin Laden, the Taliban's reclusive leader, Mullah Omar, said he refused to give in to US pressure to surrender the suspected terrorist. The Taliban regard Mr Bin Laden as a hero for his help in bankrolling the guerrilla fight against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s. His financial resources continue to aid Kabul's new masters; they also rather enjoy the fact that his presence aggravates the Americans. At some point they may use him as a bargaining chip. The Saudi millionaire - long exiled by his country - is wanted by a US court for the bombings of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania two years ago in which more than 200 people, mainly Africans, died. \"Extraditing Osama bin Laden, who made jihad (holy war) against the Communists for the duration of their occupation of Afghanistan, is tantamount to leaving a pillar of our religion,\" Mullah Omar said in the magazine. If there were sufficient evidence against Mr Bin Laden, he said, the Taliban would try him in an Islamic court. He suggested that a meeting of Islamic scholars from Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia and a third country should decide how to resolve the issue. The United States says it has already provided sufficient evidence of Mr Bin Laden's involvement in the bombings. In November the United Nations security council imposed financial and aviation sanctions on Afghanistan for failing to turn Mr Bin Laden in. More embargo measures are now being considered. The Taliban magazine in which the mullah's interview appeared is billed as a monthly is published in English. The publication, which is titled the Islamic Emirate, said its aim was to counter \"misinformation from Zionist media\" and opposition to the Taliban from the US. With a forlorn cover picture of a half-destroyed village by the Kabul river, the magazine carried a series of articles about Islam and Afghanistan interspersed with verses from the Koran. Giving an outline of the war-torn 1990s in Afghanistan, it described the Taliban as \"a simple band of dedicated youths from rural Kandahar\". Under Mullah Omar, the Taliban have taken over most of the country in the past decade and enforced their strict interpretation of Islamic sharia law. Afghan women have become virtual prisoners in their homes, banned from employment, and public amputations and executions have been used against criminals.",

Nine impeccably peaceful Vikings will clamber out of a historic wooden sailing ship on to the northern tip of Newfoundland today after a voyage of nearly 2,000 miles from Iceland; their minds will probably be focused less on pillaging than on having a relaxing warm bath. As the Icelanders step ashore - to be welcomed by Herb Gray, the deputy prime minister of Canada - these intrepid latter-day Norsemen will rekindle memories of an era of exploration and seamanship that is only eclipsed in most people's minds by the deeds of Christopher Columbus and his contemporaries. Although this year's 1,000th anniversary of the voyage of Leif Eriksson has spawned fewer tributes and a more human scale of commemoration than Columbus's 500th anniversary celebrations eight years ago, it has also stirred far less controversy. Nearly 500 years before Columbus sailed the ocean blue, \"Leif the Lucky\" and his crew of Viking sailors became the first Europeans to set foot in north America. The bay at L'Anse aux Meadows in northern Newfound land where the Viking voyagers are scheduled to arrive today may also be the spot where Eriksson and his crew first stood on dry land after their voyage from Greenland in AD1,000.

He said: \"We need to make sure we bring the knowledge base closer to business.\" Relenza in a nutshell \u0095 In 1983, Australian physicist Peter Colman discovered a \"soft spot\" in flu viruses. \u0095 The drug was taken on by Australian biotech firm Biota, which signed up Glaxo Wellcome in 1989 to develop it. \u0095 Trials showed that if taken within 36 hours of flu striking, Relenza could speed recovery by up to two days, at a cost of \u00a324 per patient. \u0095 Relenza was first approved in Sweden in February 1999. Analysts predicted first-year sales of \u00a3100m, reaching a peak of \u00a3500m in 2005. \u0095 In October, the national institute for clinical excellence said the drug was not cost effective. Glaxo chairman Sir Richard Sykes threatened to move the company overseas. \u0095 Relenza has generated revenue of just \u00a319m in its first six months.",

BEUC voices merger worry An influential consumers' group has written to the European Commission voicing concern over Time Warner's proposed merger with America Online and planned joint venture with EMI Group.

The two separate deals are both presently being reviewed by EU competition authorities. BEUC said it was artificial to distinguish between them. \"They are linked in fact,\" a spokesman said.",

      "bodyText": "A fuel-tank fire triggered by catastrophic engine failure could have caused the crash of the Air France Concorde this week and TWA flight 800, which went down over the Atlantic in 1996, American fire specialists suggested last night. A report by Blazetech of Cambridge, Massachusetts, written nearly 25 years ago specifically mentions the vulnerability of the Concorde to fires produced by catastrophic engine failure. An account of the report in this week's issue of New Scientist says that the risk of fire and explosion in the Concorde's fuel tanks was initially recognised in a British Aerospace report in 1976. British Aerospace, now called BAe Systems, last night refused to release the report for \"judicial reasons\" surrounding the investigation into the Air France crash. Blazetech produced its report for the US Federal Aviation Administration after the TWA flight crashed into the Atlantic in 1996. The author of the Blazetech report, Albert Moussa, said last night that the television pictures of the doomed Concorde just before it crashed showed that \"a distinct portion of the flame was quite hot\". \"This suggests to me that the metal parts of the engine are burning and the engine failure was pretty severe,\" he said. Mr Moussa said that any air disaster of this type usually depended on a sequence of events: Two of which he said were that the fragment of metal in any engine failure had to be large enough to puncture the fuel tank; and the plane had to be unlucky enough to be travelling in the direction of the leaking fuel supply, exposing it to elements that could ignite it. Britain's regulatory body, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), last night released details of a list of 37 safety-related incidents, referred to as \"mandatory occurrence reports\" (MOR), involving British Airways fleet of seven Concordes during the past 12 months. The CAA has to be notified by the company if an MOR has been filed by a pilot or air traffic control. The CAA said that the number of MORs for the Concorde was slightly lower than normal for a fleet of BA's size during a 12-month period. A spokesman said: \"Most of these incidents will be relatively minor and will not directly affect the safety of the flight.\" During the past 12 months, six incidents were filed after an engine had shutdown. Several incidents involving the Concorde's airframe were also reported, including wing cracks and wing spar defects. But officials said the frequent and stringent inspections demanded by the CAA meant that all these incidents were discovered before they affected safety.",

      "bodyText": "Two weeks ago a man strolled into the reception centre of a busy campsite near Farnborough in Hampshire and booked a two night stay, signing himself into the visitors' book as Reinhard Zeuner from Erlangen in Germany. That day, Friday July 14, Bobby Kelly's face was on the front of the Express newspaper under the headline \"Cult kidnap boy aged 16.\" He was in other newspapers too, and the cult members with him read the reports with alarm. Their fear was that Bobby would be \"deprogrammed\" - forcibly made to give up the religious beliefs he had acquired since he left his grandmother's home in Romford to travel with them a month earlier. So Zeuner and another cult member, Andrew Eagles, took Bobby to the campsite, where they kept a low profile, renewing their stay every few days. Vanessa Sands, a hostel warden from Bristol who camped alongside, said: \"To me they didn't look like lads who'd gone away camping together. They weren't like normal lads, they weren't drinking or having a laugh. They'd just sit hunched over their Primus stove, looking around, being quiet and serious.\" Bobby was accompanied to a phone box where he recorded an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme. In this interview, barred from broadcast for 10 days after his family obtained an injunction, the boy admitted missing his family but denied he was being held against his will. In the campsite at Mytchett, on the Surrey-Hampshire border, they maintained a facade of normal holidaymaking, with Zeuner enquiring about local attractions and expressing an interest in the nearby Royal Army Medical Corps museum. But the search for the boy was intensifying, with an appeal by a high court judge, Mr Justice Munby, for Bobby to come forward and for the public to help with any information on his whereabouts. On Tuesday, the day of the judge's appeal, Detective Constable Shaun Reardon of the Metropolitan police kidnap and special investigations unit rang the campsite and asked if a Mr Zeuner had booked in. Visitors' services manager Susie Porter took the call. \"You've just missed him,\" she said. Five hours earlier the group had packed up their two domed tents and headed into the woods behind the field. Here, in a clearing in the woods at Ash Ranges, Bobby was found and the two men were arrested by plainclothes detectives at 10.30am yesterday. On the Jesus Christians' website, the group declared that \"we recognised something like this was almost inevitable\". The website reiterates their fear of \"deprogramming\". It states: \"We regard Bobby Kelly as an adolescent... not fully adult, not fully child... 16-year-old children all over Britain do things that their parents and guardians do not agree with, but the police are not called in, a nationwide manhunt is not mounted... and certainly the whole country is not banned from hearing their side.\" Founded by David McKay in 1981 and at one time - maybe still - consisting of no more than his family, friends and dropouts picked up on the group's travels, the Jesus Christians preach a fundamentalist version of Christianity, insisting that salvation can be obtained only by reverting to the precepts of the Bible. The insistence on returning to a wandering lifestyle, not dependent on money, has not prevented the group carrying out a series of stunts with a shrewd eye to publicity, such as superglueing Australian dollar bills to pavements to illustrate the illusory nature of cash and dressing up as babies outside more orthodox religious gatherings to demonstrate the need to be childlike to accept God's message.",

Mr Gregory and the Guardian appear to have their own Irish republican agenda for Northern Ireland. I have mine in the Ulster Unionist party and that is to create a long-term and stable peace in the province, which I have tried to do in my work for Unionism for the last 30 years.

      "body": "<b>Nine injured in German bridge blast</b> <br> <p>An explosion on a footbridge leading to at a railway station in D\u00fcsseldorf injured nine people yesterday, including a heavily pregnant woman who had to have a leg amputated at the scene. </p> <p>The woman, in her 20s, was later reported to have lost her unborn child in hospital. She was said to be in a critical condition, along with a man who had serious injuries to the stomach. </p> <p>As appeals were broadcast for blood donors, police said the explosion had been caused by a fragmentation device. They said it was unclear whether the device used was a grenade or a homemade bomb. </p> <p>A police spokesman, Andre Hartwich, said there were no early indications that the attack was politically motivated. No warning had been given before the device went off. </p> <p>The DPA news agency reported that most of the victims were foreigners. But it was unclear whether they were visitors from abroad or German residents of immigrant origin. </p> <p>The station chosen for the attack is a particularly busy one, with a large number of connections to bus and tram lines. The device, loaded with shrapnel, went off at the start of the afternoon rush hour, as shoppers and the first commuters were hurrying home. </p> <p>A reporter from the ZDF television network said blood was spattered all around the area. \"The situation at the scene was terrible\", said Suzanne Freitag. Scores of police descended on the area and a helicopter was used to ferry victims to hospital. </p> <p>Yesterday's blast was the second of its kind this year. In May a man was arrested after a hand grenade exploded in a Hamburg discotheque, injuring nine people, in what was believed to be a revenge attack. <br>John Hooper, Berlin </p> <p><b> France to extend law on abortion </b><br> </p> <p> The Socialist-led government in France confronted decades of resistance from the Catholic church yesterday by proposing to extend the country's legal abortion period from the first 10 to 12 weeks of pregnancy. </p> <p>The reform, which would bring France more in line with most of its neighbours, would also remove the need for girls under 18 to get parental permission before seeking an abortion or buying the morning-after pill, and it would lift a ban on \"pro-abortion propaganda\". </p> <p>The employment and health minister, Martine Aubry, said the 10-week deadline - in force since 1975 when France finally legalised abortion after years of bitter debate - meant that about 5,000 French women left the country each year to terminate their pregnancy abroad. </p> <p>She said the reform bill would be put before parliament as soon as possible and should become law by the end of the year. </p> <p>Some 220,000 abortions are performed annually in France.

      "bodyText": "Nine injured in German bridge blast An explosion on a footbridge leading to at a railway station in D\u00fcsseldorf injured nine people yesterday, including a heavily pregnant woman who had to have a leg amputated at the scene. The woman, in her 20s, was later reported to have lost her unborn child in hospital. She was said to be in a critical condition, along with a man who had serious injuries to the stomach. As appeals were broadcast for blood donors, police said the explosion had been caused by a fragmentation device. They said it was unclear whether the device used was a grenade or a homemade bomb. A police spokesman, Andre Hartwich, said there were no early indications that the attack was politically motivated. No warning had been given before the device went off. The DPA news agency reported that most of the victims were foreigners. But it was unclear whether they were visitors from abroad or German residents of immigrant origin. The station chosen for the attack is a particularly busy one, with a large number of connections to bus and tram lines. The device, loaded with shrapnel, went off at the start of the afternoon rush hour, as shoppers and the first commuters were hurrying home. A reporter from the ZDF television network said blood was spattered all around the area. \"The situation at the scene was terrible\", said Suzanne Freitag. Scores of police descended on the area and a helicopter was used to ferry victims to hospital. Yesterday's blast was the second of its kind this year. In May a man was arrested after a hand grenade exploded in a Hamburg discotheque, injuring nine people, in what was believed to be a revenge attack. John Hooper, Berlin France to extend law on abortion The Socialist-led government in France confronted decades of resistance from the Catholic church yesterday by proposing to extend the country's legal abortion period from the first 10 to 12 weeks of pregnancy. The reform, which would bring France more in line with most of its neighbours, would also remove the need for girls under 18 to get parental permission before seeking an abortion or buying the morning-after pill, and it would lift a ban on \"pro-abortion propaganda\". The employment and health minister, Martine Aubry, said the 10-week deadline - in force since 1975 when France finally legalised abortion after years of bitter debate - meant that about 5,000 French women left the country each year to terminate their pregnancy abroad. She said the reform bill would be put before parliament as soon as possible and should become law by the end of the year. Some 220,000 abortions are performed annually in France. About 10,000 girls under 18 become pregnant each year, of whom about 6,000 have abortions. The bill will allow them to buy the morning-after pill without prescription, and to seek an abortion after consulting a doctor and a counsellor. It will also permit French secondary school nurses to distribute the morning-after pill, overruling an earlier decision by the supreme court that a highly controversial free distribution scheme launched this year by a junior education minister was in breach of French law.

The case - particularly the imprisonment for three days of Mr Gusinsky and the armed police raid on his company headquarters - had prompted protests at home and abroad.</p> <p>Commentators in Moscow suggested yesterday that prosecutors may have dropped the case after reaching a compromise with Mr Gusinsky - possibly even a commitment from the tycoon to soften the criticism of the Kremlin in the media outlets he controls. His newspapers and television channels have been critical of the president, Vladimir Putin, since he came to power. A spokesman for Media-Most denied that negotiations had taken place.</p> <p>Last month Mr Gusinsky was charged with embezzling some $10m (\u00a36.6m) of state funds during the takeover of a St Petersburg television company in 1997. He maintained that his arrest represented a heavy-handed attempt to intimidate him and to silence his media empire.</p> <p>In a two-sentence letter sent to Mr Gusinsky late on Wednesday, the chief prosecutor on the case stated that charges had been dropped. Property belonging to the tycoon, including his country house outside Moscow confiscated by the state two weeks ago, was returned, and an injunction preventing him from leaving the country was lifted.</p> <p>Sources at the prosecutor general's office said that investigations into the privatisation were continuing, but that the inquiries no longer concerned Mr Gusinsky directly.</p> <p>On hearing the news, Mr Gusinsky left Moscow immediately to join his wife and three sons at his villa in Spain.

      "bodyText": "Investigators have dropped fraud charges against Russian media magnate Vladimir Gusinsky, saying they have found no evidence of a crime, it emerged yesterday. The sudden decision was the latest development in the extraordinary Media-Most affair. The case - particularly the imprisonment for three days of Mr Gusinsky and the armed police raid on his company headquarters - had prompted protests at home and abroad. Commentators in Moscow suggested yesterday that prosecutors may have dropped the case after reaching a compromise with Mr Gusinsky - possibly even a commitment from the tycoon to soften the criticism of the Kremlin in the media outlets he controls. His newspapers and television channels have been critical of the president, Vladimir Putin, since he came to power. A spokesman for Media-Most denied that negotiations had taken place. Last month Mr Gusinsky was charged with embezzling some $10m (\u00a36.6m) of state funds during the takeover of a St Petersburg television company in 1997. He maintained that his arrest represented a heavy-handed attempt to intimidate him and to silence his media empire. In a two-sentence letter sent to Mr Gusinsky late on Wednesday, the chief prosecutor on the case stated that charges had been dropped. Property belonging to the tycoon, including his country house outside Moscow confiscated by the state two weeks ago, was returned, and an injunction preventing him from leaving the country was lifted. Sources at the prosecutor general's office said that investigations into the privatisation were continuing, but that the inquiries no longer concerned Mr Gusinsky directly. On hearing the news, Mr Gusinsky left Moscow immediately to join his wife and three sons at his villa in Spain. A Media-Most spokesman, Dmitri Ostalsky, said the tycoon was \"delighted\" by the news. \"It is too early to come to any conclusion about why the prosecutor decided to drop the charges now. We have always maintained that the accusation was absurd,\" he added. Experts in Moscow drew their own conclusions from the developments. Sergei Markov, of the Institute of Political Studies, interpreted the dropping of charges as a sign of the government's recognition that the original attack on Mr Gusinsky had been \"crudely and badly\" handled. \"I'm convinced that the Kremlin will continue to put pressure on Media-Most, only now they will go about it in a more intelligent fashion,\" he said. The Kommersant newspaper reported yesterday that Mr Gusinsky had made a deal with the government, promising to soften criticism of the Kremlin broadcast by NTV, Russia's largest private television company, in exchange for having the charges dropped. Sources told the newspaper - which is partly owned by Mr Gusinsky's arch rival Boris Berezovsky - that the Media-Most chief had been negotiating with representatives from the presidential administration all week, and had finally agreed to tone down the station's position \"both in relation to the state and to President Putin personally\". Sergei Ryabov, a political analyst from the Carnegie Centre in Moscow, said he believed this interpretation was highly likely, and claimed that even yesterday's coverage of the news on NTV was noticeably more loyal in its tone, particularly in relation to the situation in the breakaway region of Chechnya. But NTV's editor in chief, Vladimir Kulistikov, said he had not been asked to change the station's line. \"We cover events that take place, and the position of the television company will not change in any way,\" he said. Mr Gusinsky agreed to tone down coverage of the last war in Chechnya during the 1996 presidential campaign, when he joined a group of businessmen lobbying to secure Boris Yeltsin's re-election, to prevent a Communist revival.",

Punching the air in celebration, Ashley Pittman, 22, said he felt as though his life was back on track after the nightmare he had lived through since the accusation was made. According to the prosecution, the woman, then a biology undergraduate at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth, was so traumatised by the alleged attack that she waited more than two years to contact the police. But a jury of seven women and five men took 45 minutes to reach a unanimous verdict clearing Pittman of the charge following a three day trial at Swansea crown court. Pittman's mother, a former policewoman, said the case against her son should never have been brought. Speaking outside the court, she said: \"The cost to Ashley cannot be calculated and there is no avenue of compensation open to him. All our lives have been on hold.

      "body": "<p>Just after 8am today, the rusting, rickety turnstile out of the Maze prison and into the visitors' car park will begin to clatter. It will fall silent only after midday, when the last of 76 men will leave jail to rejoin the world outside.</p> <p>It is the culmination of the early release scheme of the Good Friday agreement, the two-year cut-off point at which all qualifying prisoners yet to benefit from the handsome increases in remission are free to go. Only 15 inmates will be left behind and the Maze, once home to 1,700, will close shortly.</p> <p>Today marks the biggest one-day exodus from the Maze, 10 miles west of Belfast, and marks a fulcrum in the peace process. And it will be the most painful moment of all for victims' relatives as the atrocities involved are still so recent. The scheme has released 428 convicted terrorists ahead of schedule, 143 of whom were life-sentence prisoners. Those freed will include 192 loyalists and 226 republicans, such as Sean Kelly, 26, the IRA bomber who murdered nine with the Shankill Road bomb, and Torrens Knight, 30, Ulster Freedom Fighter and murderer of 11.</p> <p>No one is sure exactly how many terrorists have served time. It is estimated to be between 25,000 and 30,000 during the past 30 years.</p> <p>The Northern Ireland Office figures indicate little recidivism. Of 456 life-sentence prisoners released between 1983 and the start of the early release scheme, only one was recalled to jail. Only one prisoner freed under the agreement has had his licence revoked and been returned to custody for suspected terrorism. He was an IRA volunteer who served a five-year term before defecting to dissident republicans, and was held this year when police intercepted a car carrying explosives at Hillsborough, Co Down.</p> <p>Ten more prisoners benefiting from the scheme, believed to be mostly loyalists, have since been charged, though none for terrorist offences - the charges include assault, drug-dealing, and driving offences and those held include three life-term prisoners.</p> <p>Each prisoner leaving the Maze this morning will receive a \u00a352.20 discharge payment, and some will qualify for a \u00a3100 clothing grant. Prisoners' groups have been in the Maze this month to ensure all will have filled out benefit forms and applications for housing. Employ- ment is the biggest single problem facing prisoners, and it worries Garnet Busby, 46, a former Ulster Volunteer Force member who now works for the Sandy Row Residents Group in south Belfast. He served 16 years of a life term for murdering an IRA member.</p> <p>\"Most prisoners will have no means at all to earn,\" Mr Busby says. \"They are coming back into a much more affluent Northern Ireland, and they are going to be excluded from that. They will be bored, and some will be tempted to get involved in crime unless government takes some action to bind them in to the peace process.\"</p> <p>Thomas Quigley, 44, jailed for the IRA attack on Chelsea Barracks in 1982, in which two were killed, was released last year after 16 years. He is now working with Tar Isteach, one of 20 republican prisoners' groups, the first of which was founded in 1995.</p> <p>\"Even now, prisoners are worried about their security when they come out,\" he says. \"They are unhappy venturing close to interfaces. That cuts down on the jobs open to them, and it is not as if there is much choice in deprived areas like north Belfast.\"</p> <p>Research in working-class republican areas suggests long-term unemployment for prisoners may be as high as nine in ten. It is likely to run around the same level within loyalist districts. Mike Ritchie, project director of Coiste na n-Iarchimi, an umbrella organisation for the republican groups, is campaigning for convictions to be wiped. (He hopes that the government may back that in a few years if political progress continues. Most employers demand details of criminal records, dismissing anyone later caught lying. All convictions above 30 months are never spent, and access to many public sector jobs is ruled out.)</p> <p>According to Mr Ritchie, \"Many ex-prisoners end up working on the black taxis, the favoured transport in west Belfast, or as security men on the doors of pubs and clubs. Some might get work as labourers or on building sites, but the black economy is very important. Many end up in the funded sector, mostly working as volunteers.\"</p> <p>Prisoners' groups liaise with social services and the housing executive, and also offer retraining programmes. They are also becoming involved in counselling which was unthinkable when the Troubles were at their peak.</p> <p>Former Ulster Defence Association member Billy McQuiston, 43, who spent more than 12 years at the Maze for offences including armed robbery, says: \"The rate of marriage breakdown is high. Men who have married a quiet girl come out to find she rules the roost at home and they are the stranger. There is an enormous strain.\"</p> <p>Prisoners' groups also aim to become involved in commercial activities; one republican group, in Derry, has branched out: it has opened a gym in the Creggan area.</p> <p>European funding through peace and reconciliation schemes is running at \u00a34m over five years to prisoners' groups on both sides; but there are doubts about its future. The groups say there is no government cash on top of that, and feel it is insufficient. Victims disagree. They say they get virtually nothing at all, often having to haggle hard even for their funeral expenses.</p> <p>The families of the so-called disappeared - victims abducted and secretly murdered by the IRA - were enraged yesterday at news they would each receive compensation of \u00a310,000. Nine families qualify.

      "bodyText": "Just after 8am today, the rusting, rickety turnstile out of the Maze prison and into the visitors' car park will begin to clatter. It will fall silent only after midday, when the last of 76 men will leave jail to rejoin the world outside. It is the culmination of the early release scheme of the Good Friday agreement, the two-year cut-off point at which all qualifying prisoners yet to benefit from the handsome increases in remission are free to go. Only 15 inmates will be left behind and the Maze, once home to 1,700, will close shortly. Today marks the biggest one-day exodus from the Maze, 10 miles west of Belfast, and marks a fulcrum in the peace process. And it will be the most painful moment of all for victims' relatives as the atrocities involved are still so recent. The scheme has released 428 convicted terrorists ahead of schedule, 143 of whom were life-sentence prisoners. Those freed will include 192 loyalists and 226 republicans, such as Sean Kelly, 26, the IRA bomber who murdered nine with the Shankill Road bomb, and Torrens Knight, 30, Ulster Freedom Fighter and murderer of 11. No one is sure exactly how many terrorists have served time. It is estimated to be between 25,000 and 30,000 during the past 30 years. The Northern Ireland Office figures indicate little recidivism. Of 456 life-sentence prisoners released between 1983 and the start of the early release scheme, only one was recalled to jail. Only one prisoner freed under the agreement has had his licence revoked and been returned to custody for suspected terrorism. He was an IRA volunteer who served a five-year term before defecting to dissident republicans, and was held this year when police intercepted a car carrying explosives at Hillsborough, Co Down. Ten more prisoners benefiting from the scheme, believed to be mostly loyalists, have since been charged, though none for terrorist offences - the charges include assault, drug-dealing, and driving offences and those held include three life-term prisoners. Each prisoner leaving the Maze this morning will receive a \u00a352.20 discharge payment, and some will qualify for a \u00a3100 clothing grant. Prisoners' groups have been in the Maze this month to ensure all will have filled out benefit forms and applications for housing. Employ- ment is the biggest single problem facing prisoners, and it worries Garnet Busby, 46, a former Ulster Volunteer Force member who now works for the Sandy Row Residents Group in south Belfast. He served 16 years of a life term for murdering an IRA member. \"Most prisoners will have no means at all to earn,\" Mr Busby says. \"They are coming back into a much more affluent Northern Ireland, and they are going to be excluded from that. They will be bored, and some will be tempted to get involved in crime unless government takes some action to bind them in to the peace process.\" Thomas Quigley, 44, jailed for the IRA attack on Chelsea Barracks in 1982, in which two were killed, was released last year after 16 years. He is now working with Tar Isteach, one of 20 republican prisoners' groups, the first of which was founded in 1995. \"Even now, prisoners are worried about their security when they come out,\" he says. \"They are unhappy venturing close to interfaces. That cuts down on the jobs open to them, and it is not as if there is much choice in deprived areas like north Belfast.\" Research in working-class republican areas suggests long-term unemployment for prisoners may be as high as nine in ten. It is likely to run around the same level within loyalist districts. Mike Ritchie, project director of Coiste na n-Iarchimi, an umbrella organisation for the republican groups, is campaigning for convictions to be wiped. (He hopes that the government may back that in a few years if political progress continues. Most employers demand details of criminal records, dismissing anyone later caught lying. All convictions above 30 months are never spent, and access to many public sector jobs is ruled out.) According to Mr Ritchie, \"Many ex-prisoners end up working on the black taxis, the favoured transport in west Belfast, or as security men on the doors of pubs and clubs. Some might get work as labourers or on building sites, but the black economy is very important. Many end up in the funded sector, mostly working as volunteers.\" Prisoners' groups liaise with social services and the housing executive, and also offer retraining programmes. They are also becoming involved in counselling which was unthinkable when the Troubles were at their peak. Former Ulster Defence Association member Billy McQuiston, 43, who spent more than 12 years at the Maze for offences including armed robbery, says: \"The rate of marriage breakdown is high. Men who have married a quiet girl come out to find she rules the roost at home and they are the stranger. There is an enormous strain.\" Prisoners' groups also aim to become involved in commercial activities; one republican group, in Derry, has branched out: it has opened a gym in the Creggan area. European funding through peace and reconciliation schemes is running at \u00a34m over five years to prisoners' groups on both sides; but there are doubts about its future. The groups say there is no government cash on top of that, and feel it is insufficient. Victims disagree. They say they get virtually nothing at all, often having to haggle hard even for their funeral expenses. The families of the so-called disappeared - victims abducted and secretly murdered by the IRA - were enraged yesterday at news they would each receive compensation of \u00a310,000. Nine families qualify. Willie Frazer, spokesman for Families Acting for Innocent Relatives, who has lost five family members, says: \"We have people coming out of the Maze who were laughing when they were jailed last year for a total of 640 years. They knew they would be out soon. \"They will be feted as heroes and their own organisations will look after them. And what do the victims get - a cup of tea and a bun with Prince Charles?

The opposition is hoping to get as many as 300,000 demonstrators out for what will be the third day of protests this week. Organisers said that tens of thousands of people were converging on the capital yesterday from around the country. But with a strong police presence and fears of bloodshed - a concern shared by Amnesty International - news agency reports said that as of yesterday, many Lima residents seemed to be staying home. The election victory that won Mr Fujimori his third five-year term was tainted by irregularities. It became a one-horse race when the opposition challenger, Alejandro Toledo, withdrew after doing well in the first round, claiming unfairness. In a bid to improve his democratic credentials, Mr Fujimori on Wednesday named as his prime minister an opposition moderate, Frederico Salas, mayor of one of Peru's poorest provincial capitals and a former presidential candidate. \"We want our government to show more consensus,\" Mr Fujimori said. \"Salas's presence proves what we have always shown: openness to people who are not members of the governing party.\" But outside the presidential palace - ringed by hundreds of riot police - unionists and students protesting against the man they call \"the dictator\" were not convinced that the cabinet change would alter things, according to reports from the scene. \"Salas is a pawn used by Fujimori to make his election look legitimate,\" said Daniel, 40, a clerk, who was waving a banner supporting Mr Toledo. Mr Toledo has been saying that a quarter of a million people will gather outside congress in Lima today when Mr Fujimori takes office, perhaps a third of these demonstrators brought in from the jungle, Andean highlands and Pacific coast in buses, open trucks and boats. Even though Mr Fujimori has said today's demonstration would be allowed to \"go ahead without incidents\", there were several reports that the authorities were stopping people arriving in Lima. The air force has declared a no-fly zone above the city, prohibiting reporters and international monitors from observing the protests in helicopters. Mr Toledo said: \"Hundreds upon hundreds of people are being detained in various parts of the country. We are practically under a state of siege.\" But the Organisation of American States is putting some pressure on him for democratic reform, as is Washington.

I believe this led to an assessment of the poverty of their own system and to require them to admit it produced neither power nor dignity and therefore led to the enormous changes in east-west relations we are seeing.\"</p> <p>A pity about the dates. Cheney's denunciation of star wars came several months before the fall of the Berlin Wall and when Moscow was still only tinkering with economic reform.

A sceptical Congress had long been chipping away at SDI funding and in October 1988 Cheney's predecessor as defence secretary cut star wars back by roughly half.</p> <p>Far from being panicked, Gorbachev enjoyed the bureaucratic civil war in Washington in which the star wars maximalists lost out. The Soviet leader contributed to their defeat by repeatedly saying Moscow would not bother to join an arms race in space, and it was the American economy which would lose out. \"I think you're wasting your money. I don't think it will work. But if that's what you want to do, go ahead,\" he told Reagan at the Washington summit in December 1987.</p> <p>But that's the end of the good news. Star wars was not completely scrapped.

Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait and the Gulf war, in which Cheney was to play a major role, were still more than a year away. Here was Cheney already anticipating a nuclear shield against third world states.</p> <p>The charitable explanation might be that Cheney could not destroy star wars in one go, given the attraction to the hi-tech community of any new scientific option plus the huge subsidies which the arms industry would enjoy. So he could only reduce it and invent a new rationale.</p> <p>Sadly, there is a grimmer version. Cheney's whole career shows he was always an advocate of American global interventionism, with a propensity to exaggerate both the threats America faces and its need for military rather than political means to deal with them. As a congressman in the 1980s, he backed US funding and military help for the contra rebels in Nicaragua, Jonas Savimbi in Angola, and the mojahedin in Afghanistan. In the Pentagon under George Bush senior, he master-minded the US invasion of Panama. Months before Clinton turned it into the linchpin of its European strategy, Cheney was calling for Nato's expansion into eastern Europe. So George W's choice of Cheney for vice-president is not a reassuring sign that he wants an experienced infighter who understands how the White House has to handle powerful congressional committees. It is proof that Bush's instincts on foreign policy are ultra-hawkish.</p> <p>As the father of the scaled-down version of star wars which is currently known as the National Missile Defence, Cheney is not going to find it emotionally easy to renounce it. The best hope is that as a man who must by now understand the growing desire of European governments not to be taken for granted by their American super-ally he will control his unilateralist reflexes.</p> <p>The current defence secretary, William Cohen, is at least moving in that direction.

      "body": "<p>I have been with my husband for 23 years and we have three teenage children. Ten years ago I wanted to break up as I was very unhappy, but my husband would not agree to it.</p> <p>He now has a relationship with a woman with children of her own and who is known (and liked) by me and by our children. I have no problem with this. The difficulty is that he hates having to tell lies when he visits her and plans to tell our children about her. He is determined to pursue this course.</p> <p>I would welcome ideas about how I can help the children handle their responses when the time comes. This man has always been a good father and I believe that the children need loving relationships with both of us. Might it be that his honesty is the best path?</p> <p><b> Stop living in denial</b><br></p> <p>Your correspondent is concerned about deceiving her children about the relationship between her husband and another woman. It seems to me that she and her husband have been grossly deceiving their children for the past 10 years and it is this that will cause more difficulties than the extra-marital relationship.</p> <p>If they had been open about the fact that their marriage was a purely practical arrangement then the revelation that her husband was satisfying his need for love and affection with a different woman would be expected and understandable.</p> <p>Instead the children are likely to feel betrayed when their family is revealed to them as something quite other from what they had been led to believe. They will need to build up trust in people and their own perceptions of reality again.

      "bodyText": "I have been with my husband for 23 years and we have three teenage children. Ten years ago I wanted to break up as I was very unhappy, but my husband would not agree to it. He now has a relationship with a woman with children of her own and who is known (and liked) by me and by our children. I have no problem with this. The difficulty is that he hates having to tell lies when he visits her and plans to tell our children about her. He is determined to pursue this course. I would welcome ideas about how I can help the children handle their responses when the time comes. This man has always been a good father and I believe that the children need loving relationships with both of us. Might it be that his honesty is the best path? Stop living in denial Your correspondent is concerned about deceiving her children about the relationship between her husband and another woman. It seems to me that she and her husband have been grossly deceiving their children for the past 10 years and it is this that will cause more difficulties than the extra-marital relationship. If they had been open about the fact that their marriage was a purely practical arrangement then the revelation that her husband was satisfying his need for love and affection with a different woman would be expected and understandable. Instead the children are likely to feel betrayed when their family is revealed to them as something quite other from what they had been led to believe. They will need to build up trust in people and their own perceptions of reality again. But I would think that this is better faced sooner rather than later. I suspect that your correspondent doesn't want her husband to tell the children because of the likelihood that it will expose her own feelings of self-denial which she must have buried in order for her to live life how her husband wanted her to and how she thought she should for the sake of her children. She will need to relearn how to live life, doing what she wants to do for herself rather than what she thinks she ought to do. I have been realising how daunting this is for myself over the last two and a half years after a lifetime of being a dutiful daughter, wife, mother and citizen. When my husband of 23 years said he wanted to develop a relationship with another woman but didn't want to break up the family I asked him to leave as I was not prepared to provide \"the services of love\" while his love went elsewhere. I had been unhappy and unsatisfied for some years but felt I shouldn't end something I had committed to, so at first the break-up felt like an enormous relief. But then I found myself weeping for no obvious reason. I became quite unable to make the decisions about what to do from the trivial \"Do I want tea or coffee?\" to the huge \"What do I want for the rest of my life now all that I had been expecting has been destroyed?\". I don't think that I had ever before made a significant decision purely for myself and I have found it a difficult skill to begin to learn. I have used a counsellor to help me, and I think I am now slowly beginning to be able to recognise and acknowledge my feelings and act on them. I am optimistic that I will gradually develop a life of my own choosing and be better for it. As for my children, well, it must have been difficult at first for them but I am not aware that they have any serious problems. Their academic progress has not faltered, their social lives continue to develop, they seem happy in themselves. They all accept the situation between their father and me. They choose to see him quite often but use my house as their base. They really can't understand why I have any difficulty in knowing what I want for myself. Hilary Chivall, Peterborough Tell the truth My parents separated over six years ago and although at the time it was difficult for myself and my four brothers and sisters, all under 16, I believe that they did the right thing. The most important thing is for you to be happy, so tell the truth and ultimately your children will respect you, their father and your decision, as I do my parents. Name and address withheld Break free now Your husband's wish to tell your children about his lover is at odds with his refusal to agree to the break-up of your marriage for the sake of the same children.

Even those who don't in principle mind eating doe-eyed baby animals might balk at tucking into one that has spent its short life in a crate, deprived of light, bedding and all food but milk, unable to move or lie down properly. And yet this, the purists argue, is the whole point of veal: the meat must be pale and tender. This, says Rowley Leigh of Kensington Place restaurant, involves \"a kind of infanticide\". To achieve the pale look and melting texture, young milk-fed calves must be reared for maximum weight gain in ways that avoid darkening the meat.</p> <p>Of course, this welfare issue isn't new. Campaigners succeeded, 10 years ago, in getting veal crates - the individual cells in which calves are raised - banned in this country. So while Dutch animals still languish in dark solitude, British ones have to be housed with other calves where they can move around. And while French ones stand still wolfing processed milk and waiting to die, British ones can at least have a good lie down on a straw bed.</p> <p>This is set to change - again for the better - because by 2006 veal crates must be phased out in all EU countries. But will this mean the end of veal cutlets as we know them?</p> <p>Since veal crates were outlawed here, British veal has been pinker, tougher and fattier than its foreign crate-fed counterpart. As Leigh puts it: \"The more exercise and more fresh air and more access to grass the animal gets, the faster the meat will develop muscles and therefore become tougher and darker.\"</p> <p>This is why farmers - in Britain and the rest of Europe - are trying to come up with ways to produce uncrated, \"welfare-raised\" veal without sacrificing the tender whiteness of the meat. And it looks like progress is being made. This month an East Sussex farm exported its first 50 humanely reared veal calves - chopped up and vacuum packed - to Europe. It is the first step in a joint scheme run by the British company Anglo Dutch Meats and the French company Serval. If it works it could be good news for veal eaters and farmers alike.</p> <p>Veal is, in some ways, a by-product of the dairy industry. To keep cows producing milk, they need to give birth once a year, having their calves removed when they are a day old. But since 1996 the beef ban has stopped the export of British calves to the continent, and farmers have had to dispose of - that is, slaughter - two million unwanted male calves every year. Even now that most aspects of the ban have been lifted, calves under six months old still can't be exported. But their meat can, as long as they've been slaughtered at more than six months old and the farmer can prove that their mother is alive and well. The French are big veal eaters, so there is a huge market for British veal exports, but the problem is quality. The idea behind this new veal scheme is to produce veal that is as good as crate-raised meat, without the cruelty.</p> <p>Paul Ashworth, coordinator of the joint project, says the calves have been reared on a milk-only diet and housed loosely in groups of 30 with natural light and plenty of space. However, unlike other British veal calves, they are subject to a strict computerised feeding regime, developed and overseen by French technicians who pioneered the project in response to the forthcoming European ban on veal crates.</p> <p>\"The old-fashioned system,\" explains Ashworth, \"lets the calves eat as much as they want whenever they want.\" But this means that some of the calves - the greedy ones - get fat while others languish, and because of this the quality of the meat can vary enormously, which makes exporting it difficult.</p> <p>\"With this new system each calf gets an individualised feeding regime,\" says Ashworth. This makes the meat more reliable. Each animal has a computer chip in its ear, and when it shows up for its milk the computer identifies it and adjusts the amount accordingly. So big greedy calf might find that his milk runs dry, while little shy one will get a bellyful. The result is \"peas in a pod\", as Ashworth puts it: \"Our calves were all a similar size and weight.\"</p> <p>But does it really taste like crate-raised veal? \"No,\" says Kevin Pierce, beef and sheep adviser to the National Farmers' Union, \"but the growing market in Europe today is not for crated meat. Everyone has to switch to the welfare-friendly system.\"</p> <p>The hope is that this new veal will be excellent in its own right and raised humanely. Pierce claims that \"the animals are very well looked after\" and Joyce D'Silva, the director of Compassion in World Farming, is cautiously optimistic: \"There has never been a more cruel trade than the export of live calves, so we're glad that animals at last are going out on the hook rather than on the hoof. We're hoping that meat from high-welfare British systems will set the standard throughout the EU for veal calf rearing in future.\"</p> <p>Leigh points out that \"there is no one thing called British veal - different people are producing different sorts of veal\", but this very lack of uniformity may turn out to be a strength.</p> <p>Different kinds of veal already have different followings. For instance, Marc Beaujeu, the buying manager for Personal Catering, eulogises a particular kind of French veal called veaux sous la m\u00e8re . \"This is,\" says Beaujeu, \"a different way of raising the animals that is far more humane.\" The calf suckles from its mother in the field, fully at liberty until it is slaughtered. \"The meat turns out more red than crate-raised veal,\" says Beaujeu, \"but in my opinion it has a far better flavour.\"</p> <p>The calf in this situation will probably eat a bit of grass, but will mainly feed on its mother's milk, and the quality of this milk will far outstrip anything it could get in powdered form. \"It's like the difference between free-range and battery-raised chickens,\" says Beaujeu. \"The result is far better.\"</p> <p>You can get veaux sous la m\u00e8re from most French butchers, though you'll pay more for it. And this is perhaps the central issue: if you want to mass-produce meat cheaply, you can't have your calves running around suckling from their mothers in open fields.</p> <p>Still, where there's variety there's competition, and at least animal lovers can rejoice in the fact that, in 2006, veal crates will be a thing of the past in Europe.

      "bodyText": "Few foods have raised as many hackles as veal. Even those who don't in principle mind eating doe-eyed baby animals might balk at tucking into one that has spent its short life in a crate, deprived of light, bedding and all food but milk, unable to move or lie down properly. And yet this, the purists argue, is the whole point of veal: the meat must be pale and tender. This, says Rowley Leigh of Kensington Place restaurant, involves \"a kind of infanticide\". To achieve the pale look and melting texture, young milk-fed calves must be reared for maximum weight gain in ways that avoid darkening the meat. Of course, this welfare issue isn't new. Campaigners succeeded, 10 years ago, in getting veal crates - the individual cells in which calves are raised - banned in this country. So while Dutch animals still languish in dark solitude, British ones have to be housed with other calves where they can move around.

      "body": "<p>Water has always been more important than gold or silver in the history and development of the American west, but unlike the fever over precious metals it was difficult to understand or make interesting. Marc Reisner, who has died of cancer at the age of 51, changed all that.</p> <p>His 1986 book, Cadillac Desert: The American West And Its Disappearing Water, did a similar job for its subject to that of Rachel Carson's seminal work on pesticides, Silent Spring (1962). Both changed the law but, more importantly, they brought the issue of a threatened environment into political prominence. Reisner's book was ranked by the Modern Library as 61st on a list of the 100 most notable English-language books of the 20th century.</p> <p>As a television documentary series, often beautiful as well as revelatory, it was screened in America in 1997, and was shown abroad, including in Britain. Its black and white photographs of the men who built the massive Hoover dam, on the Colorado river near Las Vegas, were as compelling por traits of human endeavour and courage as images from the second world war.</p> <p>Reisner had the remarkable ability to explain entertainingly the complex, and often numbing, deals and disputes in the \"water wars\" that have plagued the west, particularly California, for nearly 200 years. Tourists on their way to Death Valley today sometimes pause to look at the aqueduct that carries water from the once-fertile Owens valley more than 300 miles to Los Angeles. They have read Reisner's book, which describes how the water was stolen, how the Owens lake, which once bore paddle steamers, was turned into a dustbowl, and how the canal was bombed by local people in the 1920s.</p> <p>Reisner recounted the drama of the collapse of the Saint Francis dam in a valley of shale, north-west of Los Angeles, in 1928. It had been built by the legendary William Mulholland, a self-taught hydro-engineer, who presided over the aqueduct from Owens valley and was a popular hero. When the dam crumbled, it sent a 200-ft high wall of water to the sea, killing more than 400 people and destroying 1,200 homes. It also ruined Mulholland, after whom the home of film stars, Mulholland Drive, is named.</p> <p>Such follies and tragedies were only part of Reisner's argument, still debated today, that much of the west is simply too arid to permit extensive development, and that eventually nature will have her revenge. Yet only this year have developers been forced to demonstrate how they will provide water before erecting houses.</p> <p>Another forecast Reisner made is still largely ignored, but irrefutable - that the massive dams across the west, such as Hoover, Parker and Glen Canyon, will one day cease to provide electricity, and turn into spectacular waterfalls as the lakes behind them fill with silt. He also reported that no irrigated community has existed for longer than 400 years.

      "bodyText": "Water has always been more important than gold or silver in the history and development of the American west, but unlike the fever over precious metals it was difficult to understand or make interesting. Marc Reisner, who has died of cancer at the age of 51, changed all that. His 1986 book, Cadillac Desert: The American West And Its Disappearing Water, did a similar job for its subject to that of Rachel Carson's seminal work on pesticides, Silent Spring (1962). Both changed the law but, more importantly, they brought the issue of a threatened environment into political prominence. Reisner's book was ranked by the Modern Library as 61st on a list of the 100 most notable English-language books of the 20th century. As a television documentary series, often beautiful as well as revelatory, it was screened in America in 1997, and was shown abroad, including in Britain. Its black and white photographs of the men who built the massive Hoover dam, on the Colorado river near Las Vegas, were as compelling por traits of human endeavour and courage as images from the second world war. Reisner had the remarkable ability to explain entertainingly the complex, and often numbing, deals and disputes in the \"water wars\" that have plagued the west, particularly California, for nearly 200 years. Tourists on their way to Death Valley today sometimes pause to look at the aqueduct that carries water from the once-fertile Owens valley more than 300 miles to Los Angeles. They have read Reisner's book, which describes how the water was stolen, how the Owens lake, which once bore paddle steamers, was turned into a dustbowl, and how the canal was bombed by local people in the 1920s. Reisner recounted the drama of the collapse of the Saint Francis dam in a valley of shale, north-west of Los Angeles, in 1928. It had been built by the legendary William Mulholland, a self-taught hydro-engineer, who presided over the aqueduct from Owens valley and was a popular hero. When the dam crumbled, it sent a 200-ft high wall of water to the sea, killing more than 400 people and destroying 1,200 homes. It also ruined Mulholland, after whom the home of film stars, Mulholland Drive, is named. Such follies and tragedies were only part of Reisner's argument, still debated today, that much of the west is simply too arid to permit extensive development, and that eventually nature will have her revenge. Yet only this year have developers been forced to demonstrate how they will provide water before erecting houses. Another forecast Reisner made is still largely ignored, but irrefutable - that the massive dams across the west, such as Hoover, Parker and Glen Canyon, will one day cease to provide electricity, and turn into spectacular waterfalls as the lakes behind them fill with silt. He also reported that no irrigated community has existed for longer than 400 years. Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix and other neon-lit monuments to humanity are approaching the halfway mark. Reisner was born in water-abundant Minneapolis, the son of a lawyer and script- writer. He earned a bachelor's degree at a private college in Indiana. Interested in environmental politics from those early days, he worked for two years in Washington on the staff of Environmental Action and the Population Institute, before moving to the Natural Resources Defence Council, in New York, from 1972 to 1979. That year he obtained funds to research his masterpiece, and found a treasure trove in the formerly secret files of the Bureau of Reclamation, the villains of Cadillac valley (together with the Army Corps of Engineers) in their zeal to line with concrete every free- flowing river in America. In 1990 Reisner co-wrote Overtapped Oasis: Reform Or Revolution For Western Water, following it a year later with Game Wars: The Undercover Pursuit Of Wildlife Poachers, a study of 200 federal agents and their fight against illegal seizure of wildlife in the south. In his later years, environmentalists criticised Reisner for his association with two private companies, one storing water underground for profit - still better than dams, he said - and the other promoting the use of rice fibre. He had changed his mind about rice paddies in the west, he said, because they provided wetlands for birds that had otherwise been deprived of habitat. But the dispute was silly in comparison with his achievement. Reisner is survived by his wife Lawrie Mott, a biochemist, and their daughters, Ruthie and Margot. \u0095 Marc Reisner, environmentalist and writer, born Sept-ember 14 1948; died July 21 2000",

Unlike Samuel Johnson, John Keats or Felix Mendelssohn, the composer never crossed on the ferry from Mull to visit an outpost of Celtic Christianity on the chilly edge of Europe. He spent his last 27 years as cantor in the Lutheran church of St Thomas in Leipzig, which will be the focus of much of today's anniversary homage.

The 40-year-old white man and his sister, 32, are expected to appear in court today. The two were detained on Wednesday with their elderly parents, with whom they shared a remote farm, 60 miles east of Johannesburg. The police said the brother and sister \"lived as husband and wife\" and had at least nine children. But only two boys, aged 14 and seven, are accounted for. They have been taken into care. Police forensic experts and sniffer dogs were yesterday searching two farms near Delmas where the remains of at least three babies were believed to be buried. Police sources said that one of the detained suspects had offered to lead them to the graves of some of the children, but was uncertain exactly where they were buried. Inspector Olga Marais said the police had information that some of the missing children may have died of natural causes shortly after birth, but others allegedly were killed. The case has bizarre echoes of an award-winning South African novel, Triomf, by Marlene van Niekerk, about incest in a poor Afrikaans-speaking family and the child that results. The brother and sister, who have not been named, were arrested by the police child protection unit after a tip-off from a social worker who had been approached by another member of the family. The region's deputy police commissioner, Dimo Moraba, alleged that the two had been sexually involved since 1984, and that the woman was believed to have been pregnant at least 10 times. She is said to have told police that she is expecting another child soon. Neighbours described the woman as appearing to be \"almost continually pregnant\", but few of them seemed to have been alarmed by the lack of children. One resident, Elize de Klerk, said she had complained to a local Christian organisation that the couple's 14-year-old son seemed never to go to school, but to her knowledge nothing was done.",

      "bodyText": "The main body representing Europe's 12m Gypsies wants the Roma people to be given recognition as a non-territorial nation, and says it will back this up with its own \"floating\" parliament and embassies in various countries. It is the first time that the International Union Romani has made such a demand for international recognition since it was founded in London three decades ago. The organisation's fifth world congress concludes in Prague today with the presentation of a wide-reaching plan aimed at creating better living conditions for Europe's fastest-growing ethnic minority and increasing the Roma's power to lobby governments which discriminate against them. In 1993 the International Union Romani was granted the status of an advisory committee at the UN, greatly increasingly its lobbying power, but the congress document is its most significant political statement so far. It recommends the establishment of a floating parliament that would meet every three months, a network of embassies and an anti-racist committee to be linked to an international Roma court. A poll tax in the Roma community should be levied to finance the structure, the document says. It foresees the court putting racists on trial and putting pressure on governments that discriminate against Roma - but it is unclear what recognition such a tribunal would have. Sean Nazerali, one of the conference organisers said the time was long overdue to address one of the main Roma problems of the last 1,000 years - non-recognition of its nationhood by an international system geared to recognising states only. \"The Roma are a modern nation like all the rest, so we are seeking recognition as a modern nation... enabling us to play a political role at the national and international level,\" he said. He suggested that, contrary to viewing the Roma as a problem, they could be an archetype for the perfect European nation. \"It's everywhere, it has a collective identity at the European level and its people are connected throughout the entire continent.\" But progress means quashing stereotypes, he added. \"The sort of exotic but very common romantic notion of the wandering nomadic Gypsy who leads a wonderfully carefree, barefoot life, is roughly as accurate as the Indian running round on horseback, shooting bison with a bow and arrow.\" During often heated and passionate debate the conference tackled numerous issues. The migration of Roma to the west, the plight of Gypsies in Kosovo, the rise in race-related attacks against Roma and improving education have dominated the agenda. Compensation for Roma victims of the Nazi Holocaust was one of the more emotive issues. Plans were announced to set up a fund, to be financed by Roma personalities, which would establish a university as a living memorial to the half a million Roma who died. The irony of setting the conference in Prague was not lost on delegates. The Czech Republic, like several of its neighbours, has been fiercely criticised for its treatment of Roma. Of the more than 30 documented race-related killings in the region since the fall of communism - not including those in the former Yugoslavia - more than a third have been in the Czech Republic. Members of the British Gypsy Council said they had considered boycotting the conference, as had most western groups. \"We are suspicious that the Czech government put the money up for this to show how nice they're being to Gypsies, when in fact they get so poorly treated here,\" said the council's president, Josie Lee. But in his speech to the conference, President Vaclav Havel promised to \"do my best to ensure a happier life for the Roma of the Czech Republic\".",
