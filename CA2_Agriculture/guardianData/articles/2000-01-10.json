They juggled balls with players, posed for photographs and wore their United T-shirts and caps with pride. Perhaps Ferguson's words had convinced them. </p> <p>\"I think we were the best team in the tournament,\" he said. \"Definitely.

Vasco fans are hardly complaining but they could not believe how poorly the champions of Europe played. The downbeat second-half atmosphere showed what an anticlimax it was. </p> <p>\"It was not the Manchester United I know,\" said the former Brazil coach Mario Zagallo. \"I went to Tokyo to see them and I have seen them in England and this was a completely different team.

But the weather was not the true root of their downfall. Mistakes by Neville are as rare as woolly hats on Copacabana beach at this time of year. Yet he made two errors in two minutes to hand Romario his goals. Edmundo's brilliance fin ished it off. United can hardly say they were not warned of those two. </p> <p>\"Two unacceptable mistakes\" was how Neville described it. \"Contrary to what people may believe, we had come here to win this tournament,\" he added. \"With the two mistakes I made I didn't really give the team a chance. You can't give those guys opportunities.\" </p> <p>Even third place could be beyond United now, though it would mean nothing to them in any case.

They looked nervy and United had appeared comfortable until Neville lost his head. First his loose back-pass enabled Edmundo to provide Romario with No1. Then an attempt to chest a ball back to Bosnich allowed the 33-year-old in again. </p> <p>\"Sometimes, when you make mistakes like that, it's better to be punished,\" Neville said. \"It's a kick up the backside.

      "body": "<p>Even the Luddites among us are grudgingly accepting that the case for referees to be aided by television replays is becoming overwhelming. Though that alone might not have been sufficient to avoid the dreadful error at Tranmere, here a \"third eye\" similar to that employed in cricket Tests would have helped ensure Wednesday's progress to the fifth round. </p> <p>On this occasion the controversy surrounded a linesman who was providing a third eye. Unfortunately the assistant referee Trevor Massey's view was impeded by a goalmouth scramble 40 yards away and he was incorrect when he signalled that Steve Sedgley's header had crossed the line. None of the Wolves players had claimed that it had. </p> <p>It was no less than Wolves deserved for a stirring second-half fight-back but it was hard not to sympathise with the Premiership's whipping boys, whose manager Danny Wilson asked: \"How can a linesman, 40 yards away with 20 bodies in front of him, make that sort of decision? I find it unbelievable, particularly when Wolves haven't even claimed for it.\" </p> <p>Perhaps the most alarming aspect of the affair for Wednesday was the almost Corinthian grace with which they accepted their fate.

      "bodyText": "Even the Luddites among us are grudgingly accepting that the case for referees to be aided by television replays is becoming overwhelming. Though that alone might not have been sufficient to avoid the dreadful error at Tranmere, here a \"third eye\" similar to that employed in cricket Tests would have helped ensure Wednesday's progress to the fifth round. On this occasion the controversy surrounded a linesman who was providing a third eye. Unfortunately the assistant referee Trevor Massey's view was impeded by a goalmouth scramble 40 yards away and he was incorrect when he signalled that Steve Sedgley's header had crossed the line. None of the Wolves players had claimed that it had. It was no less than Wolves deserved for a stirring second-half fight-back but it was hard not to sympathise with the Premiership's whipping boys, whose manager Danny Wilson asked: \"How can a linesman, 40 yards away with 20 bodies in front of him, make that sort of decision? I find it unbelievable, particularly when Wolves haven't even claimed for it.\" Perhaps the most alarming aspect of the affair for Wednesday was the almost Corinthian grace with which they accepted their fate. Aside from the goalkeeper Pavel Srnicek's appeal at the final whistle there was no dissent, merely the casual air of resignation with which their players have begun to accept their fruitless travails in the Premiership. There is nothing wrong with being magnanimous but it is hard to imagine Manchester United or the Leeds team of the early 70s being so accepting of such an injustice.

      "body": "<p>During the Newlands Test last week - and quite a few more of recent lamenting memory - as Mark Nicholas's ball-by-ball Talk Radio commentating team described the helter-skelter of England wickets falling in a bunch, at the same time as breathlessly ensuring their ruddy office-rental sponsor received its money's worth of mentions, you might have wondered what it was like in the supposed golden ages of long ago, pre-sponsorship, when England batsmen stayed magisterially at the crease for day upon day under the sweltering suns of Empire. </p> <p>A nice anniversary shows, in fact, that nothing much has changed. The humiliation in Cape Town coincided, almost to the day, with the 75th birthday of ball-by-ball broadcast cricket commentary and, wouldn't you know, a dreadful England batting collapse of almost modern proportions. </p> <p>The Ashes Test in Sydney on England's 1924-25 tour, led by Arthur Gilligan, was played over seven days, with a break for Christmas Day, at the end of December 1924. The city's local 2BL wireless station had one of its cricket-loving reporters, one Hyam Marks, sitting inside the SCG's famous scoreboard alongside the venerable former Australian batsman Clem Hill. At irregular times through the match, the two of them described \"occasional passages of continuous play\" to listeners. </p> <p>The first Test match wicket to fall, simultaneous to being described on air, was the opener Warren Bardsley's, caught by Frank Woolley off Tich Freeman for 21 in Australia's first innings of 450 (Collins 114, Ponsford 110, Tate six for 130). </p> <p>England went in. Uncannily it was virtually a prophecy of what was to come on cricket broadcasting's 75th anniversary. In Cape Town last week, as the millennium dawned, England's first innings proceeded from an opening partnership of 115 between Mark Butcher and Michael Atherton to 213 for three before the last seven wickets collapsed for 45 and, everything frenziedly described on Talk Radio, 258 all out. </p> <p>In Sydney three-quarters of a century before, Jack Hobbs and Herbert Sutcliffe put on 157 for the opening stand, after which Patsy Hendren (74 not out) steered them to 202 for three before watching at the other end as the last seven folded in a heap for 72 (Hearne 7, Woolley 0, Sandham 7, Chapman 13, Tate 7, Gilligan 1, Freeman 0, Strudwick 6) and all out 298. And all described live on Sydney's 2BL wireless station. Nothing new under those Empire suns. </p> <p>Australia won that auspicious first Test by 193 runs and when they disdainfully wrapped up the series by 4-1 back at the SCG in March the wireless experiment was suc cessfully repeated. This time it was advertised as \"commentary and scores\". Later that year, when the Australia v The Rest Test Trial match (before selection of the 1926 side to tour England) was held in Sydney, the wireless transmission was trumpeted as \"unique ball-by-ball commentary\". </p> <p>This time it was the city's 2FC channel which did the honours, the intrepid broadcasters this time being Len Watt, a news reporter and Sydney grade cricketer, and the soon-to-be celebrated radio pioneer HP Williams, who was to become the first general manager and luminary of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. This time they worked at ground level on a trestle table almost behind the bowler's arm on the boundary line under the famous Hill. </p> <p>So Australians were very much the groundbreakers at cricket broadcasting. In Britain the fledgling BBC first attempted a live cricket commentary in May 1927 - Essex v the New Zealanders at Leyton - but it was deemed to be far too deadly dull, transmitting none of the excitement nor immediacy of the Twickenham rugby international or Wembley Cup final which they had covered live for the first time earlier that year. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Sydney's HP Williams had studio-bound commentators receiving snap cables describing each delivery for Australia's Test matches abroad, and after each over they would colour in the bare facts with descriptive inventions as-if live, along with \"canned\" sound effects for applause and pencils tapping microphones for the impression of willow on leather. </p> <p> T here had long been, of course, newsreel film of sports events, and many flickering clips survive. Feature documentary films, too, of championship boxing matches. The first live radio coverage of a boxing match was transmitted by landline into six New York cinemas in 1921, when Jack Dempsey fought the Frenchman Georges Carpentier in New Jersey. (Baseball match descriptions began similarly in private \"closed circuit\" pay-to-listen theatres.) </p> <p>But it wasn't until all of six years later, in September 1927, that a championship boxing match was heard live by a general audience - when 82 radio stations \"nationwide\" transmitted the second fight between Dempsey and Gene Tunney from Chicago. The first bout to be broadcast live and worldwide - with landlines under both the Atlantic and Pacific - was by NBC in June 1934, when Max Baer fought Primo Carnera. </p> <p>There was, alas, no recording of that first Test cricket wicket to fall - Bardsley c Woolley b Freeman - but a listening news reporter did take a shorthand transcript of the commentary, by a Major Andrew White, of the fourth round of that Dempsey-Carpentier match in 1921 . . . \"the referee is counting . . . three, four . . . Carpentier no effort to rise . . . five, six . . . he's sunk to the mat . . . nine, ten . . . The fight is over! Jack Dempsey remains world champ!\" Not bad, Major, for a historic, culture-setting first.</p>",

The first Test match wicket to fall, simultaneous to being described on air, was the opener Warren Bardsley's, caught by Frank Woolley off Tich Freeman for 21 in Australia's first innings of 450 (Collins 114, Ponsford 110, Tate six for 130). England went in. Uncannily it was virtually a prophecy of what was to come on cricket broadcasting's 75th anniversary. In Cape Town last week, as the millennium dawned, England's first innings proceeded from an opening partnership of 115 between Mark Butcher and Michael Atherton to 213 for three before the last seven wickets collapsed for 45 and, everything frenziedly described on Talk Radio, 258 all out. In Sydney three-quarters of a century before, Jack Hobbs and Herbert Sutcliffe put on 157 for the opening stand, after which Patsy Hendren (74 not out) steered them to 202 for three before watching at the other end as the last seven folded in a heap for 72 (Hearne 7, Woolley 0, Sandham 7, Chapman 13, Tate 7, Gilligan 1, Freeman 0, Strudwick 6) and all out 298. And all described live on Sydney's 2BL wireless station. Nothing new under those Empire suns. Australia won that auspicious first Test by 193 runs and when they disdainfully wrapped up the series by 4-1 back at the SCG in March the wireless experiment was suc cessfully repeated. This time it was advertised as \"commentary and scores\". Later that year, when the Australia v The Rest Test Trial match (before selection of the 1926 side to tour England) was held in Sydney, the wireless transmission was trumpeted as \"unique ball-by-ball commentary\". This time it was the city's 2FC channel which did the honours, the intrepid broadcasters this time being Len Watt, a news reporter and Sydney grade cricketer, and the soon-to-be celebrated radio pioneer HP Williams, who was to become the first general manager and luminary of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. This time they worked at ground level on a trestle table almost behind the bowler's arm on the boundary line under the famous Hill. So Australians were very much the groundbreakers at cricket broadcasting. In Britain the fledgling BBC first attempted a live cricket commentary in May 1927 - Essex v the New Zealanders at Leyton - but it was deemed to be far too deadly dull, transmitting none of the excitement nor immediacy of the Twickenham rugby international or Wembley Cup final which they had covered live for the first time earlier that year. Meanwhile, Sydney's HP Williams had studio-bound commentators receiving snap cables describing each delivery for Australia's Test matches abroad, and after each over they would colour in the bare facts with descriptive inventions as-if live, along with \"canned\" sound effects for applause and pencils tapping microphones for the impression of willow on leather. T here had long been, of course, newsreel film of sports events, and many flickering clips survive. Feature documentary films, too, of championship boxing matches. The first live radio coverage of a boxing match was transmitted by landline into six New York cinemas in 1921, when Jack Dempsey fought the Frenchman Georges Carpentier in New Jersey. (Baseball match descriptions began similarly in private \"closed circuit\" pay-to-listen theatres.) But it wasn't until all of six years later, in September 1927, that a championship boxing match was heard live by a general audience - when 82 radio stations \"nationwide\" transmitted the second fight between Dempsey and Gene Tunney from Chicago. The first bout to be broadcast live and worldwide - with landlines under both the Atlantic and Pacific - was by NBC in June 1934, when Max Baer fought Primo Carnera. There was, alas, no recording of that first Test cricket wicket to fall - Bardsley c Woolley b Freeman - but a listening news reporter did take a shorthand transcript of the commentary, by a Major Andrew White, of the fourth round of that Dempsey-Carpentier match in 1921 . . . \"the referee is counting . . . three, four . . . Carpentier no effort to rise . . . five, six . . . he's sunk to the mat . . . nine, ten . . . The fight is over! Jack Dempsey remains world champ!\" Not bad, Major, for a historic, culture-setting first.",

There, in the shadow of Table Mountain, England crumbled. </p> <p>It is precisely 13 years ago today that England, under Mike Gatting, began the final Test match of their successful Ashes tour, and the record abroad in the interim has been dismal. Fifty-eight matches have been played since that trip, in 14 series plus a couple of one-off matches, and only nine of them have been won, four of them in New Zealand who were beaten in the 1991-92 series and again five years later. </p> <p>In the eight full series of five or more matches, not once have England come within a sniff of winning, and the last time they went into the final match of such a series even with the rubber still undecided was in the Caribbean six years ago. Brian Lara put any ambitions firmly in their place with his triple century. </p> <p>So to come to South Africa this winter, with an inexperienced side under the stewardship of a new captain and coach, and expect (as opposed to hope) that they might win was fanciful. This is an immensely powerful South African side with a depth in batting unparalleled in Test history. They are playing at home, where since their readmission they have won 20 of 37 matches, losing only five. Only the Australians, and that in a close and withering contest, have beaten them in a series. </p> <p><strong> Sense of purpose</strong><br> </p> <p> Putting things in context, then, Nasser Hussain's team have acquitted themselves well, gaining respect for their spirit, sense of purpose, togetherness and tenacity. Certainly they were undeserving of the nasty, not to say deeply insensitive assertion of a tabloid newspaper that the team should be incarcerated on Robben Island. In fact, they would do well to remember that Nelson Mandela was sustained in part during his imprisonment by his capacity to take the long-term view. Hussain and Duncan Fletcher came to South Africa wanting to win the series, but above all they wanted to see progress being made towards a more stable and consistent England in the future. </p> <p>Selection was geared accordingly, and not as a reaction to the knee-jerk demands for new players that followed last summer's disastrous series against New Zealand. </p> <p>\"When I came into the job,\" Hussain has said, \"we had tried the top six for quite a while and it wasn't working. It was felt that this tour had to be a watershed.\" So familiar faces such as Graham Thorpe (by his own choice), Mark Ramprakash and Graeme Hick were missing and new ones - Michael Vaughan, Chris Adams, Darren Maddy - brought in. Of the batsmen, only Vaughan has been a success, and he only partially since he has yet to score a half-century. But he looks the part, is clearly temperamentally suited to Test cricket, has good technique and will be around now for a while. Had Hick and Ramprakash been selected (and they may yet get back into the side) Vaughan would not have had the opportunity to state his credentials. </p> <p>Fletcher and Hussain have already forged a profitable alliance, one that is respected by the players. The captain has his finger on the pulse and clearly has within him not just a sound cricket brain but a streak of ruthlessness. He presents himself to the media as articulate, thoughtful and deeply passionate. Fletcher is understated, a world away from the frenetic tenure of David Lloyd. Efficiency would be his watchword and he knows precisely where he would like England to be heading and on what timescale. </p> <p>He fully acknowledges the huge task his side faced out here and therefore has managed to keep a sense of perspective. Progress, he says, is up to schedule and perhaps even ahead, despite the fourth Test. If there are casualties - Adams looks likeliest and probably Mark Butcher too - then they have been given the freedom to play in their own way, confident that they would be given a run. They have been allowed every chance. Out of it already Vaughan has been identified as someone in whom to invest, but so too have Chris Silverwood and Andy Flintoff. That, Fletcher would say, is not a bad way to begin replacing the fabric of the side, and Andrew Caddick and Hussain himself have cemented their roles as England's key bowler and batsman. </p> <p>There is an argument which says that, with the series already lost, the rebuilding should start now; that Hussain's ruthlessness should be demonstrated with the swift introduction of Vikram Solanki, for example. Fletcher and the captain, however, have said they will not be looking outside the original tour party for this week's final Test at Centurion. </p> <p>\"It would be divisive at this stage,\" says Fletcher, and he has a point. In addition, he notes, there is not much to be learned in one game and didn't it take Herschelle Gibbs and Jacques Kallis time to learn the ropes at Test level? The management are prepared to back their judgment and the capacity of players to absorb lessons and respond accordingly. </p> <p>The real business starts when they return home, and Fletcher knows that the job of lifting the side to the competitive and technical levels enjoyed by the Australians and South Africa will be monumental. He is keen to explore the mental side of players as well as their technical ability. </p> <p>\"You have to look at that aspect,\" he says. \"I have been involved with Gary Kirsten for years and someone once asked me whether he would make it as a Test player. I said that technically I wasn't sure but that mentally he was tough and if you have that inner strength there is no limit to what can be achieved.\" </p> <p>However, Fletcher will be hampered by a county system which encourages mediocrity and then expects players to switch to international cricket without losing a beat, and by a massive international programme which precludes him watching domestic cricket to any great extent. </p> <p>He will be obstructed too in his search by the appalling standard of pitches on which young cricketers in their formative years and seasoned pros alike are compelled to play. Fletcher cites Gibbs and Kallis once more as players whose game has been honed on true surfaces and stresses the need for bowlers to be able to develop variety, allied to patience, in order to compete on proper Test pitches. </p> <p>The England and Wales Cricket Board is going some way in trying to eradicate poor pitches by the introduction next season of a \"flying squad\" who can get to a ground at a moment's notice. However, it could legislate as well (and this goes for the International Cricket Council too) by placing the responsibility for assessing a pitch in the hands of the umpires (or match referee) and giving them the power to award choice of innings to the visiting team if it is substandard.

When David Lloyd, then England's senior coach, spoke encouragingly of winning the World Cup on home soil last summer, the cynical reactions of disbelief left him cursing English sport's capacity for negativity.</p> <p>But such negativity is understandable. English team sport is failing to compete and English cricket is failing most of all. If England persistently shine at U19 level - even regularly outdoing the Australians, who all the evidence tells us have a tougher sporting upbringing than we do - then a few years later, the rot invariably sets in.</p> <p>The chief culprit is widely regarded as county cricket.

Even those immediately promoted can quickly find ambition deadened on an exhausting county circuit, where an overcrowded fixture list is maintained for the benefit of a few thousand elderly spectators.</p> <p>There remains hope that England's last World Youth Cup winners can reverse the trend. Paul Franks, at Nottinghamshire, has proved himself a combative all-rounder, qualities re-emphasised on this winter's England A tour in New Zealand. Chris Schofield's leg-spin is observed with relish not just within Lancashire. Robert Key's batting is highly regarded at Kent, and might have brought him an A tour ahead of Durham's Michael Gough.</p> <p>But, for all that, county cricket breeds complacency, and hinders development. Fast bowlers can virtually arrange their operation for a stress fracture in advance because of the excessive strains placed on developing bodies. Batting techniques are undermined by English cricket's persistent failure to produce consistent pitches of even bounce, where skill will out.</p> <p>Two years ago, Owais Shah was a media item, the A level student taking time off studies to bring England glory. That is worth recalling in a week when David Blunkett has envisaged an educational future in which schools may remain open until 10pm. For youth sport, such a future will spell chaos.</p> <p>Shah, in any case, has faltered, just as the much-touted Ben Hollioake before him. Shah was one of several Middlesex players criticised by the Australian batsman, Justin Langer, for a slack attitude towards maximising their talent. Hollioake even claimed that he is \"uncoachable\". It is a comment that would invite derision in Australia, but in England, boredom, fatigue and conceit are an ever-present danger.</p> <p>County cricket has at least been browbeaten into action. Next season, the championship splits into two divisions, with promotion and relegation. The transfer system will quicken, whatever the resistance, and in five years, perhaps less, a first division elite will possess the cream of the cricketing talent.</p> <p>But problems remain. The collapse of cricket in state schools maintains an over-reliance on the private schools, and on fast-tracking players identified at an early age. Alex Loudon, Kent's England U19 captain, has deserved his accolades. But his background is cliched: Eton College and England age-group cricket from U14 level onwards.</p> <p>English club cricket, although slowly awakening to its responsibilities, cannot fill the breach. The elite leagues introduced by the England and Wales Cricket Board will remain a nonsense until the best players play in them.</p> <p>A governing body with any guts and innovation would immediately enforce a pyramid system of club cricket, with free movement throughout all leagues, demand proper coaching and youth development, and blacklist all league clubs who failed to comply.</p> <p>Boon has experience of Sri Lankan conditions, having played for Colombo CC in 1983. He must know that for England to repeat, in the humidity of Sri Lanka, their victory in South Africa two years ago would be an achievement against the odds.</p> <p>England's U19s can do nothing more than win and, if they do, they deserve us to glory in any success, even if we believe it means little. Their opening match tomorrow, against one of the seven non-Test nations, pits them against America. Imagine if cricket really caught on in the United States.

Chris Schofield's leg-spin is observed with relish not just within Lancashire. Robert Key's batting is highly regarded at Kent, and might have brought him an A tour ahead of Durham's Michael Gough. But, for all that, county cricket breeds complacency, and hinders development. Fast bowlers can virtually arrange their operation for a stress fracture in advance because of the excessive strains placed on developing bodies. Batting techniques are undermined by English cricket's persistent failure to produce consistent pitches of even bounce, where skill will out. Two years ago, Owais Shah was a media item, the A level student taking time off studies to bring England glory. That is worth recalling in a week when David Blunkett has envisaged an educational future in which schools may remain open until 10pm. For youth sport, such a future will spell chaos. Shah, in any case, has faltered, just as the much-touted Ben Hollioake before him. Shah was one of several Middlesex players criticised by the Australian batsman, Justin Langer, for a slack attitude towards maximising their talent. Hollioake even claimed that he is \"uncoachable\". It is a comment that would invite derision in Australia, but in England, boredom, fatigue and conceit are an ever-present danger. County cricket has at least been browbeaten into action. Next season, the championship splits into two divisions, with promotion and relegation. The transfer system will quicken, whatever the resistance, and in five years, perhaps less, a first division elite will possess the cream of the cricketing talent. But problems remain. The collapse of cricket in state schools maintains an over-reliance on the private schools, and on fast-tracking players identified at an early age. Alex Loudon, Kent's England U19 captain, has deserved his accolades. But his background is cliched: Eton College and England age-group cricket from U14 level onwards. English club cricket, although slowly awakening to its responsibilities, cannot fill the breach. The elite leagues introduced by the England and Wales Cricket Board will remain a nonsense until the best players play in them. A governing body with any guts and innovation would immediately enforce a pyramid system of club cricket, with free movement throughout all leagues, demand proper coaching and youth development, and blacklist all league clubs who failed to comply. Boon has experience of Sri Lankan conditions, having played for Colombo CC in 1983. He must know that for England to repeat, in the humidity of Sri Lanka, their victory in South Africa two years ago would be an achievement against the odds. England's U19s can do nothing more than win and, if they do, they deserve us to glory in any success, even if we believe it means little. Their opening match tomorrow, against one of the seven non-Test nations, pits them against America. Imagine if cricket really caught on in the United States. Nobody would rest until a cricket pitch had been laid in every state school in Britain.

      "body": "<p>Suppose the Daily Beast were to start its own global news website. It would be a surefire winner, right? After all, the internet is creating huge new business opportunities and billions of pounds in revenue - and news websites are among the fastest-growing, most popular categories in the business. The money would just come rolling in, right? Up to a point, Lord Copper. </p> <p>There is no doubt the internet is creating massive wealth. A study by the University of Texas put the value of internet-related business in the US last year at $300bn, and rising. But where is the money going? At this relatively early stage of the industry's existence it is going, mostly, to the people who provide the technology: the infrastructure providers (Cisco and Sun), the telecoms companies (Bell, ATT and BT), the major internet service providers (AOL) and software businesses (Microsoft). </p> <p>Where it is not going is to the websites themselves - at least, not in sufficient quantities to make a profit for very many of them. The vast majority are losing money. And the big news websites, with their large staffs and relatively small revenues, are recording some of the biggest losses, despite the fact that some are now beginning to raise significant revenues. </p> <p>The internet world is one in which a company's true financial picture is seldom disclosed. Spin and speculation are rife, but hard facts are rare. An honourable exception was ABCNews.com, the third largest of the American news sites, which published a loss of $21.5m in its first year of operation (1997/98). </p> <p>It was hailed for its candour - but the publicity hurt. This year the parent Disney Corporation has chosen not to give ABC's individual figures. Instead these are included in overall losses for the group's internet operations of more than $1bn. </p> <p>CNN, which also does not give individual financial information about its internet activities, said its news site made a small profit last year - its fourth year in existence. But, it added, it would not expect to make a profit next year because the money would be ploughed into global expansion. </p> <p>All the other large news organisations are making similar decisions: the argument is not about how to make money from the web - but how to spend it. Their concern is not about how to increase revenue (though they are all trying to do that) - it is about how to establish themselves in the minds of users as the website of choice for following the news. </p> <p>They are spending heavily to achieve the dominant positions in the global news market. Then, when profitability finally arrives, they will be the ones to benefit. </p> <p>Attention has begun to shift to the \"global market\" because growth in internet usage in the US is at last beginning to slow down. One research firm, Cyber Dialogue, reported that the US internet population grew by just 13% in 1999, compared to 58% in 1998. This is seen as the inevitable result of a market reaching maturity. </p> <p>It also means that the big areas of growth in the years to come will be outside North America. Europe, South America and Asia have become important target markets. </p> <p>The relatively mature US market has shown that there is only room for a limited number of big news sites. CNN and MSNBC got off to flying starts and have remained the big players.

      "bodyText": "Suppose the Daily Beast were to start its own global news website. It would be a surefire winner, right? After all, the internet is creating huge new business opportunities and billions of pounds in revenue - and news websites are among the fastest-growing, most popular categories in the business. The money would just come rolling in, right? Up to a point, Lord Copper. There is no doubt the internet is creating massive wealth. A study by the University of Texas put the value of internet-related business in the US last year at $300bn, and rising. But where is the money going? At this relatively early stage of the industry's existence it is going, mostly, to the people who provide the technology: the infrastructure providers (Cisco and Sun), the telecoms companies (Bell, ATT and BT), the major internet service providers (AOL) and software businesses (Microsoft). Where it is not going is to the websites themselves - at least, not in sufficient quantities to make a profit for very many of them. The vast majority are losing money. And the big news websites, with their large staffs and relatively small revenues, are recording some of the biggest losses, despite the fact that some are now beginning to raise significant revenues. The internet world is one in which a company's true financial picture is seldom disclosed. Spin and speculation are rife, but hard facts are rare. An honourable exception was ABCNews.com, the third largest of the American news sites, which published a loss of $21.5m in its first year of operation (1997/98). It was hailed for its candour - but the publicity hurt. This year the parent Disney Corporation has chosen not to give ABC's individual figures. Instead these are included in overall losses for the group's internet operations of more than $1bn. CNN, which also does not give individual financial information about its internet activities, said its news site made a small profit last year - its fourth year in existence. But, it added, it would not expect to make a profit next year because the money would be ploughed into global expansion. All the other large news organisations are making similar decisions: the argument is not about how to make money from the web - but how to spend it. Their concern is not about how to increase revenue (though they are all trying to do that) - it is about how to establish themselves in the minds of users as the website of choice for following the news. They are spending heavily to achieve the dominant positions in the global news market. Then, when profitability finally arrives, they will be the ones to benefit. Attention has begun to shift to the \"global market\" because growth in internet usage in the US is at last beginning to slow down. One research firm, Cyber Dialogue, reported that the US internet population grew by just 13% in 1999, compared to 58% in 1998. This is seen as the inevitable result of a market reaching maturity. It also means that the big areas of growth in the years to come will be outside North America. Europe, South America and Asia have become important target markets. The relatively mature US market has shown that there is only room for a limited number of big news sites. CNN and MSNBC got off to flying starts and have remained the big players. ABC News and Fox have achieved some success but CBS, who entered last, have found it almost impossible to make any impact. So how many big global news sites can prosper? Two? Four? Six? Well, despite the immature, incoherent and largely abstract nature of the \"global market\", there are already three: CNN, Yahoo News and my own site, BBC News Online. All three have mature global strategies and significant numbers of users around the world. Yahoo is slightly different from CNN and the BBC, in that it is a \"news aggregator\" and not a primary source in its own right.

      "bodyText": "Britain's biggest police force was criticised today for its failings in murder investigations, in a damning report highlighting undermanned and overworked squads. The report found that senior investigators at the Metropolitan police were regularly forced to juggle 12 murder cases, with fewer resources than were given to their counterparts in provincial forces. Officers throughout the Met said they did not believe that investigating murder was a priority for the force, which has a murder solution rate of 84% compared with an average of 92% nationwide. Some complained that senior officers were indifferent to the problems they faced, coupled with \"unacceptably low staffing levels\" within murder squads, according to the report by Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary. It found \"too many staff working under pressures which are avoidable and cannot be justified\". One senior detective told the inspection team: \"The Met is not equipped to investigate lengthy murder inquiries.\" The report found there was a common perception among staff that chief officers had little understanding of what was involved in a murder investigation. It concluded: \"If the MPS is to improve on its performance in respect of murder detection there must be an increase of staff allocated to murder investigation.\" Senior investigators told inspectors that they were at times carrying \"excessively high\" workloads, with one saying he was looking into 14 murder offences. The report said: \"Her Majesty's Inspector ... is concerned that an SIO may be tempted to focus time and resources on new 'easy to solve' cases at the expense of longer running cases.\" However, it commended officers' work in training in murder scene attendance and investigation and said the majority of staff demonstrated a commitment \"of which the MPS can be proud\". The study was ordered by home secretary Jack Straw after the Stephen Lawrence report last year and looked into the investigation of murders and the force's community and race relations policy. However, the report did find considerable improvements in the Met's race relations policy and practice. Considerable efforts have been made to improve services to London's ethnic minority communities. Although more thought needs to be given to a pan-London strategy, the inspection judged that stop and search initiatives had been well-managed. Much more effort is needed to attract and retain ethnic minority staff, but the work of the racial and violent crime task force was highly praised. The inspector, Dan Crompton, said that he was confident that further improvements would have made by the beginning of 2001. Home office minister Charles Clarke said he was concerned at the finding by inspectors that officers did not see murder investigations as a key priority. The report said: \"There is more to be done in securing the hearts and minds of non-specialist police officers. A pervasive feeling exists among some staff that what is seen as special treatment for the victims of racist attacks can only be delivered by prejudicing service to the wider community. \"Until officers and staff understand the impact of hate crime because of skin colour or cultural difference, securing the appropriate initial response to victims will remain an unfulfilled challenge.\" But it said the internal culture within the force had improved despite the low level of officers from ethnic backgrounds. Senior officers at the Met said its murder clear-up rate should not be compared to provincial forces but instead judged against other major capital cities. The Met's clear-up rate is higher than Paris at 75%, Dublin at 74%, Amsterdam at 70% and Washington DC at 44%, according to figures collected by Scotland Yard. The report said it could not be proved that the Met was a special case but found that its relatively low detection rate was down to low resources rather than the competence or expertise of officers.

Luton won the replay 2-1 and Law had his goals removed from the record books. </p> <p><strong>Newcastle v Nottingham Forest</strong> (FA Cup, 1974)</p> <p>Forest were leading 3-1 when Newcastle fans staged a pitch invasion. After the game resumed, the Magpies came back to win 4-3, only for the Football Association to order a replay on neutral ground. After a 0-0 draw at Goodison Park, Newcastle finally won the second replay 1-0 and eventually went on to lose to Liverpool in the final. </p> <p><strong>Leeds v Stuttgart</strong> (European Cup, 1992)<br> Leeds thought they were out of the Uefa Cup despite winning the second leg of the tie 4-1 at Elland Road. Stuttgart scored the vital away goal, but it turned out that they had also broken Uefa regulations by fielding four foreign players instead of the permitted three. Swiss international Adrian Knup came on as a substitute, and it was three minutes until Italian Maurizio Gaudino was taken off. The replay was played at a neutral ground - the Nou Camp - and Leeds won 2-1. </p> <p><strong>Arsenal v Sheffield United</strong> (FA Cup, 1999)<br> After an injury to an Arsenal player, Sheffield United sportingly kicked the ball into touch. When the Gunners tried to return the ball, new signing Kanu, looking to make a good impression, intercepted and created the winning goal in a 2-1 victory. Gunners boss Arsene Wenger claimed that Kanu was not aware of the custom of returning the ball, and both teams agreed to replay the match. Again, Arsenal won 2-1.</p> <p><strong>Farnham v Herne Bay</strong> (FA Cup, 1999)</p> <p>Herne Bay used four substitutes in their FA Cup qualifying match victory earlier this season. Their chairman realised the mistake and went straight to the FA, who ordered the game to be replayed, this time at Farnham. The game went to a second replay, but eventually Herne Bay ran out 2-1 winners. </p> <p><strong>West Ham v Aston Villa</strong> (Worthington Cup, 1999)</p> <p>Manny Omoyimni came on for seven minutes in this Worthington Cup tie, but had already played in an earlier round of the competition whilst on loan to Gillingham. The Hammers went on to win the match on penalties, but the FA ordered the tie to be replayed.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Manchester City v Luton (FA Cup, 1961) Denis Law had scored all six goals as Manchester City moved into a 6-2 lead at Luton in the fourth round of the FA Cup, only for the match to be abandoned due to fog with 10 minutes remaining. Luton won the replay 2-1 and Law had his goals removed from the record books. Newcastle v Nottingham Forest (FA Cup, 1974) Forest were leading 3-1 when Newcastle fans staged a pitch invasion. After the game resumed, the Magpies came back to win 4-3, only for the Football Association to order a replay on neutral ground. After a 0-0 draw at Goodison Park, Newcastle finally won the second replay 1-0 and eventually went on to lose to Liverpool in the final. Leeds v Stuttgart (European Cup, 1992) Leeds thought they were out of the Uefa Cup despite winning the second leg of the tie 4-1 at Elland Road. Stuttgart scored the vital away goal, but it turned out that they had also broken Uefa regulations by fielding four foreign players instead of the permitted three. Swiss international Adrian Knup came on as a substitute, and it was three minutes until Italian Maurizio Gaudino was taken off. The replay was played at a neutral ground - the Nou Camp - and Leeds won 2-1. Arsenal v Sheffield United (FA Cup, 1999) After an injury to an Arsenal player, Sheffield United sportingly kicked the ball into touch. When the Gunners tried to return the ball, new signing Kanu, looking to make a good impression, intercepted and created the winning goal in a 2-1 victory. Gunners boss Arsene Wenger claimed that Kanu was not aware of the custom of returning the ball, and both teams agreed to replay the match. Again, Arsenal won 2-1. Farnham v Herne Bay (FA Cup, 1999) Herne Bay used four substitutes in their FA Cup qualifying match victory earlier this season. Their chairman realised the mistake and went straight to the FA, who ordered the game to be replayed, this time at Farnham. The game went to a second replay, but eventually Herne Bay ran out 2-1 winners. West Ham v Aston Villa (Worthington Cup, 1999) Manny Omoyimni came on for seven minutes in this Worthington Cup tie, but had already played in an earlier round of the competition whilst on loan to Gillingham. The Hammers went on to win the match on penalties, but the FA ordered the tie to be replayed.",

That is the nub of his defence against lawyers who are attacking his plans to curb the right to jury trial.

He boasts that he has backed substantial increases in state funds for both Tories (from \u00a31.53m to \u00a33.38m) and Liberal Democrats (\u00a30.3m to \u00a31.08m). \"I am in favour of fair funding of opposition parties and have sought in government to put into practice things which I thought were unfair in opposition.\" As for the joint sessions pioneered by Mr Blair and Paddy Ashdown, Mr Straw has attended all of them. \"There are still differences of emphasis between me and some of my Liberal Democrat friends on the issue of PR. \"But I am in favour of cooperation with the Liberal Democrats on issues where we are in broad agreement, what Vernon Bogdanor called the 'popular front of the mind.\" Whether defending the controversial asylum act which comes into force in October or his refusal to outlaw indirect racism in the race relations (amendment) bill, Mr Straw always relies on a mixture of lightly-worn principle, pragmatism and his native optimism. Asked if his disdain for liberalism makes him illiberal he replies with laughter. \"No, no. Fair and effective is what I would say.\" Later he stressed that effective is not the same as efficient. \"Efficient is a narrower concept. Being effective is about outcomes. Being efficient is about process.\" Very New Labour. Jack Straw is on message. \u0095 Mr Straw has warned that the English are \"potentially very aggressive, very violent\" and will increasingly articulate their Englishness following devolution. Speaking as part of a BBC Radio 4 series about what it means to be British, to be broadcast today, Mr Straw said the English had used their \"propensity to violence\" to \"subjugate Ireland, Wales and Scotland\". He added: \"I think as we move into this new century, people's sense of Englishness will become more articulated and that's partly because of the mirror that devolution provides us with and because we're becoming more European at the same time.\" What the minister said On the Met: \"Where you have a major inquiry of that kind (Stephen Lawrence) it is bound to produce a short-term shock ... But I am convinced that good has already flowed from the process and will produce better, more effective policing in London.\" On anti-social behaviour orders: \"I am disappointed about the take-up and we are working to improve advice to local authorities and police about how they should be used ... Where they have been granted people on the ground have found they are very successful.\" On freedom of information bill: \"Where ministers refuse to accept the recommendation of the tribunal to make a disclosure the minister himself is responsible to parliament for that decision. That seems to me to be the right process.\" On human rights act: \"It will be seen in retrospect as the most significant change from the legal aspect last century.\"",

Whatever, things were certainly different in the 50s and 60s, when no artist would venture out in anything less than a fur-trimmed Roller with gold-plated hub caps. The best of these fabulous vehicles can still be seen in two extraordinary car museums, one at the Liberace Foundation in Las Vegas, the other at Elvis's home, Graceland, in Memphis. </p> <p>Automobiles may have been at least partly to blame for Elvis's slothful ballooning, but he still loved them. \"The first car I ever bought was the most beautiful I've ever seen,\" Elvis once said. \"It was secondhand, but I parked it outside my hotel the day I got it and stayed up all night just looking at it. The next day it caught fire and blew up on the road.\" </p> <p>I suspect it may have been suicide. The car knew what he would have done to it had it lived. The first new car he bought, soon after his first string of hits on the Sun record label, was a 1956 Cadillac. According to legend, Elvis went into the showroom clutching a pound of grapes and squeezed the fruit on to the bonnet of the demonstrator. \"That's the colour I want my Cadillac, thangyouverrymuch,\" he said. It was the only known instance of Elvis wasting food. </p> <p>That Cadillac is the first car you see as your eyes adjust to the reverently dimmed light inside the museum. The rest of the collection is arranged in a horseshoe around a re-creation of a drive-in movie theatre. Filmgoers watch selected car moments from Elvis's movies on a continuous loop, while parked in authentic 1957 Chevrolet seats. </p> <p>The collection is by no means complete - Elvis's legendary gold Caddy is on display at the Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville and other Elvis-mobiles are often advertised on the internet. As his wealth snowballed he began buying new cars, each of which he would personalise with the same good taste that judged the living room ceiling to be an appropriate place to lay shag pile. Cadillacs, Jeeps and Harley Davidson motorbikes abound throughout the rest of the museum, each with either a spangly silver or a bilious pink paint job to mark them as the property of the King. Occasionally Elvis inadvertently allowed good taste to obscure his better judgment and bought a European machine. But even then he either chose a dud (his black Ferrari 308 GT4 is about as desirable in Ferrari circles as rust), or irretrievably disfigured his purchase with an ill-advised piece of customising (as with the vile blue leather in his Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud). </p> <p>Elvis didn't reach his zenith until the 70s, and neither did his cars. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry when I reached the half way stage of the tour and the centre piece of the exhibition: a brace of Stutz Blackhawks. </p> <p>Even in standard trim Stutz Blackhawks are ostentatious. The first one ever made was originally ordered for Frank Sinatra in 1971; Elvis charmed it from the dealer for $26,500 (Sinatra's response is not recorded). Frustratingly, an assistant wrecked that car while on his way to wash it shortly after Elvis took delivery (it was later repaired). Undeterred, the King bought another of the Pontiac-engined monsters and had its interior plated with 18-carat gold. Both are on display at Graceland. </p> <p>As if Elvis's cars hadn't suffered enough, he even tried to murder one of them. As is the custom with highly strung, mid-engined Italian supercars, Elvis's rare and beautiful De Tomaso Pantera refused to start one morning. Instead of calling a breakdown service, as you or I might, he simply pulled out his gun and shot it. </p> <p>By the standards of what Wladziu Valentino Liberace did to his cars, Elvis's Pantera got off lightly. Las Vegas's Liberace Car Gallery is possibly the only car museum that could rival Elvis's for chintz and chutzpah. I took a cab there from the Strip and found, alongside the world's biggest rhinestone and more dodgy candelabra than Bermondsey market, numerous customised classics. </p> <p>Take the priceless Rolls-Royce Phantom V Landau, smothered in tiny mirror tiles etched with a design of galloping horses. Beside it in the low-rise museum compound, ranged appropriately around a parking lot, sits a matching Baldwin grand piano. Or Liberace's Excalibur, a British confection based loosely (and I mean loosely) on the legendary Mercedes SSK. This one is covered from head to fender in Australian rhinestones (his favourite semi-precious rock). </p> <p>Liberace, at one time the highest-paid musician in the world, didn't own a car until he was 30, when he bought an Oldsmobile 88 convertible - chosen because a piano has 88 keys. But once he bought that he was hooked, and embarked on an automotive spending spree untrammelled by notions of taste or restraint. As with Elvis, but sadly not today's off-the-peg stars, Liberace didn't stop once he'd bought a car. Even his more mundane machinery would be decorated with a piano key motif, or bedecked with his trademark candelabra. But Liberace's greatest automotive crime was that the only mileage his grand and costly cars accrued was in carrying their owner on and off stage to the applause of a sea of blue rinses. </p> <p>As you wander around the rest of the collection, you cast incredulous eyes over a Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud with a striking red, white and blue colour scheme, in honour of America's bicentennial; a bastardised Beetle - \"Volks-Royce\" - part Roller, part VW; a customised London cab (Liberace was a committed Anglophile - or \"insufferable snob\" as they are known in the US); a 1964 Cadillac with diamond-studded candelabra, a bar with sterling silver cups depicting winners of the Kentucky Derby, and a TV and stereo; as well as dozens more motoring atrocities. As far as I'm concerned, it more than warrants its title of \"Nevada's third most popular tourist attraction\". </p> <p>One man whose name crops up in both museums is George Barris, fabled customiser and creator of the original Batmobile. Barris painted Elvis's gold Cadillac, and also plastered Liberace's 1954 Eldorado with a chrome piano key design and used candelabra as (hardly pedestrian-friendly) bonnet ornaments. </p> <p>It could be that today's pop stars need a man like Barris to pep up their garages. He could decorate Morrissey's Porsche with a fibreglass quiff; the Sterophonics' car could be swathed in sheepskin; or maybe Liam Gallagher would like a large pair of bushy eyebrows atop the windscreen of his Bristol. </p> <p>I suspect my fantasies may all be in vain.

      "body": "<p> At its launch, the new Fiat Punto lost its spirit. Or at least its spirito: the ad campaign for the new model traded the wry wit of the \"Spirito di Punto\" series for a dollop of American cheese. And hey, if those elephants, giraffes and ostriches didn't make you laugh, there was a fat man, too! </p> <p>Thankfully, the car's image projectors are now back on track with a new series of boy v girl dialogues, to which the obvious subtext is that Fiat's best-ever seller is the essence of cute. Few will disagree; if you thought the original was a nice-looking duckling (Ford evidently did, given the styling tribute that is the Focus) it's fair to say that Punto II is a fanciable swan. </p> <p>Like size-10 stilettos, five-door hatchbacks can look clumsy, but Punto's proud haunches are so confidently styled that, in this case, the five-door manages to be chic. Check the bold, pointy tail lights and clever kicked-out boot; like a little Dolce and Gabbana number, it looks trim from every angle. Blessed with a flatter, more pert posterior, the three-door car looks even tidier. Punto's face now shows more character; the headlamps are complex, all-in-one clusters and they glare with the kind of insect-like cool you'd expect from a BMW. </p> <p>Inside, there's enough room for at least half an average Italian family. The stereo sits logically on a pronounced bump atop the dash, but visibility is excellent for most of 360 degrees. The seats are comfy and big on side support; they encourage you to assume an uprightish stance, but that's entirely suitable for this car's roadgoing nature. </p> <p>Fiat braved a potential caseful of jokes by staging Punto II's launch in a remote corner of western Sicily. Brimming with pride, the mayor of the labyrinthine mountain-top town of Erice threw his streets open to visiting journalists. Studying the map carefully, I charged my JTD 1.9 diesel test car the wrong way down a generous alleyway, being forced to retrace my tracks after a swift 58-point turn. Still, the manoeuvre was invaluable: it showed how well the new \"City\" button works - you push it in and the steering goes light as an air steward's handshake.

      "bodyText": "At its launch, the new Fiat Punto lost its spirit. Or at least its spirito: the ad campaign for the new model traded the wry wit of the \"Spirito di Punto\" series for a dollop of American cheese. And hey, if those elephants, giraffes and ostriches didn't make you laugh, there was a fat man, too! Thankfully, the car's image projectors are now back on track with a new series of boy v girl dialogues, to which the obvious subtext is that Fiat's best-ever seller is the essence of cute. Few will disagree; if you thought the original was a nice-looking duckling (Ford evidently did, given the styling tribute that is the Focus) it's fair to say that Punto II is a fanciable swan. Like size-10 stilettos, five-door hatchbacks can look clumsy, but Punto's proud haunches are so confidently styled that, in this case, the five-door manages to be chic. Check the bold, pointy tail lights and clever kicked-out boot; like a little Dolce and Gabbana number, it looks trim from every angle. Blessed with a flatter, more pert posterior, the three-door car looks even tidier. Punto's face now shows more character; the headlamps are complex, all-in-one clusters and they glare with the kind of insect-like cool you'd expect from a BMW. Inside, there's enough room for at least half an average Italian family. The stereo sits logically on a pronounced bump atop the dash, but visibility is excellent for most of 360 degrees. The seats are comfy and big on side support; they encourage you to assume an uprightish stance, but that's entirely suitable for this car's roadgoing nature. Fiat braved a potential caseful of jokes by staging Punto II's launch in a remote corner of western Sicily. Brimming with pride, the mayor of the labyrinthine mountain-top town of Erice threw his streets open to visiting journalists. Studying the map carefully, I charged my JTD 1.9 diesel test car the wrong way down a generous alleyway, being forced to retrace my tracks after a swift 58-point turn. Still, the manoeuvre was invaluable: it showed how well the new \"City\" button works - you push it in and the steering goes light as an air steward's handshake. It also showed how dint-resistant the car is - when I finally managed to detach the rear quarter panel from the street corner, the metalwork obediently popped back into place, showing hardly a scratch. Once through the city walls, the JTD took to the hairpins like a supercharged sherpa. In fact, it showed such brio that it upstaged both the 1.2 litre 16-valve and the alleged Sporting version, the latter producing so little torque in second that, as I overtook a lorry, I fully expected the words \"To be continued!\" to flash across the windscreen. By now, I was starting to conceive my Punto dream-team - a creation with all the rev-lust of the JTD, all the toned handling of the Sporting and all the composure of the 1.2 ELX. Silly me, I had yet to drive the prime Punto, the HGT. This 1.8 insists and thrives on a good hard thrashing, clings to tarmac like heavily chewed gum and, at high speed, sails on with all the solid grace of a Golf GTi. Superminis face tough work to earn family car status, but the new Punto keeps Fiat in the field - a marked improvement on a car which has been Europe's best seller since 1997. Fiat's decision to kick off prices at \u00a37,995 makes the car not quite as lean as the cheapest 1.3 Encore-badged Ford Fiesta.

United's initial aloofness \"may have upset a few people,\" reasons McGivan, \"but this week when things are relaxed [ie: too late] they have done things with street kids.\" Heart warming.</p> <p>But what did Mr Blatter make of it all? \"I have had suspicions today and yesterday that Sepp Blatter is thrilled by United's being here,\" said McGivan rather unconvincingly. \"I think he's very pleased by their attitude and the way in which they have accepted defeat and yet are still keen participants.\" Which, with regards to our World Cup prospects, amounts to a small amount of bugger all.

They were not prepared to take sufficient strong action against the troublesome families. This was very difficult for the wardens.\" </p> <p>Mr Fennell said that of the ten wardens employed by the council, seven had been off work with stress and one had left permanently on ill health grounds, receiving a compensation payment of \u00a314,500. Dave Prentis, deputy general secretary of Unison, said the case was one of the most extreme examples of stress the union had dealt with. </p> <p>Chris Carter, head of planning at Worcestershire county council, which dealt with the claim as a result of local government changes, said procedures had been improved since the authority was formed two years ago, and more support was now given to gypsy liaison staff. </p> <p>Today's settlement was the third high-profile stress case brought by Unison. </p> <p>In 1994, social worker John Walker was awarded an out-of-court settlement of \u00a3175,000 against Northumberland County Council and last year housing officer Beverley Lancaster was awarded damages of around \u00a365,000 by a judge after Birmingham City admitted liability for personal injury caused by stress. </p> <p>\u0095 Recent figures showed that unions took 783 legal cases against employers for stress-related illness last year, 70% up on the previous 12 months.</p>",

Wardens accused the county council of failing to support their work, leading to a loss of their authority on the sites. At a press conference in Birmingham, where the out-of-court settlement was agreed, Mr Ingram said: \"I liked the job I did but the support wasn't there from my employers. \"I am part of the gypsy community, I have always lived in a caravan and I shall not be changing my lifestyle. \"The council has a lot to answer for, they have made me very ill with stress and depression and my home life has suffered as a result.\" Peter Fennell, regional officer of Mr Ingram's union, Unison, said that when steps were taken to evict anti-social families from sites, or refuse entry to other known troublemakers, the decisions taken by the wardens were over-ruled by council managers. \"The council appeared to take the side of the gypsies. They were not prepared to take sufficient strong action against the troublesome families. This was very difficult for the wardens.\" Mr Fennell said that of the ten wardens employed by the council, seven had been off work with stress and one had left permanently on ill health grounds, receiving a compensation payment of \u00a314,500. Dave Prentis, deputy general secretary of Unison, said the case was one of the most extreme examples of stress the union had dealt with. Chris Carter, head of planning at Worcestershire county council, which dealt with the claim as a result of local government changes, said procedures had been improved since the authority was formed two years ago, and more support was now given to gypsy liaison staff. Today's settlement was the third high-profile stress case brought by Unison. In 1994, social worker John Walker was awarded an out-of-court settlement of \u00a3175,000 against Northumberland County Council and last year housing officer Beverley Lancaster was awarded damages of around \u00a365,000 by a judge after Birmingham City admitted liability for personal injury caused by stress. \u0095 Recent figures showed that unions took 783 legal cases against employers for stress-related illness last year, 70% up on the previous 12 months.",

      "body": "<p>You would hardly notice it on a map. The small farm is tucked away in the folds of Worcestershire, sitting on a narrow country lane on the outskirts of the Middle of Nowhere. It has been the home for close on 30 years of Peter and Charmian Gibson. </p> <p>Mr and Mrs Gibson live a rural life, he's a design engineer who works from home, she's an administrator for an e-commerce association based in the nearby village. They are quiet, private people who suffered the type of tragedy last June that no parent should have to suffer. Their son, Robert, took his own life. He had just completed a fine art degree at Southampton institute. He was awarded a first. </p> <p>The Gibsons never asked FHM magazine to come barging into their lives last October, raking up their grief. They never asked FHM magazine to trivialise the death of their son or make a joke of its cause. They never asked to go into battle with an editor, Anthony Noguera - a battle which ultimately included Oxford university, the National Union of Students, the Samaritans and the Press Complaints Commission. But FHM came ploughing into Lench Farm anyway, wielding arrogance and ignorance and decided that as far as it was concerned the Gibsons were merely a sideshow in a much larger affair. Getting \"the kids\" to talk about suicide. </p> <p>Drive 350 miles north from the Gibsons' farm and you come to the Edinburgh home of Angela and Kerry Napuk. Their daughter, Sarah, took her own life in April 1997. They didn't ask FHM magazine to trivialise the death or make a joke of its cause, either. But FHM just shrugged and got on with what it does best, irreverent, sarcastic coverage of any subject, however sensitive, in the name of the lad's mag revolution. </p> <p>The Gibsons, the Napuks and three other families' children appeared in a special edition of FHM magazine that was distributed to universities across Britain at the start of the new academic year last autumn. In the free student guide were a series of articles on suicide entitled Straight to Hell, followed by an exclamation mark to give another little twist. Their tone astonished many and has raised serious questions both about the way the media cover such delicate subjects and about magazines that consider themselves outside the normal ethical controls of the media world. </p> <p>Oxford university, Southampton institute and the National Union of Students all condemned the \"grossly offensive\" reporting. The Gibsons and the Napuks also lodged a formal complaint with the Press Complaints Commission, saying that the articles broke the code of practice. The commission has now agreed that FHM was involved in a \"serious breach\" of its code on intrusion into grief. It said the articles were \"gratuitously humorous\". </p> <p>\"The article was written in a humorous style and included examples of students who had committed suicide, tips on how to kill yourself and advice from a counsellor on how to prevent student suicide,\" the adjudication said. </p> <p>\"The commission agreed with the magazine that suicide is a matter of public interest and noted that the style of the piece was clearly intended for a particular audience of young people. However one of the key features of the code of practice is the way in which it seeks to protect particularly vulnerable groups of people, including those who are suffering at times of grief and shock. </p> <p>\"In this case, the commission noted that the complainants' children had died relatively recently - in one case only a few months prior to publication - and the magazine should have taken every care strictly to abide by the terms of the code which requires sensitivity in such circumstances. It had not done so, and instead of due sensitivity had treated their deaths in a gratuitously humorous manner.\" </p> <p>The attitude of Straight to Hell was clear from the start. \"The rest of the world might think you have it easy, but some students prefer suicide to another term of cider, exams and Red Dwarf . . .\" the articles began, before detailing five \"case studies\" including those of Robert Gibson and Sarah Napuk. The tone was jokey: under a picture of a man, all clown tears and mock contrition, was the line: No one heard Tim's cry for help. And more. The magazine, sponsored by Pizza Hut, which has since said it is reviewing its relationship with FHM, gave a \"how to\" guide to different suicide methods. \"Gun? Rope? Cyanide? Suicide may be the easy way out but that doesn't mean that it is simple to get right. So try these methods for size.\" It went on to detail, in comic tones, hanging, \"bullet through the head\", overdose and jumping. </p> <p>\"A pistol in the mouth is quick and easy, but remember to leave the safety catch off,\" the magazine said. \"For maximum wall art effect use a shot gun like Ernest Hemingway, pulling the trigger by tugging on a piece of string.\" </p> <p>And there was more. \"How to construct a baffling suicide note\", \"isn't it better to go down the bar and have a beer\" and an effectiveness rating for each suicide method. </p> <p>When the magazine was published in October, all hell broke loose. Oxford university, at which two of the deaths mentioned in the articles took place, withdrew the magazine. Alex Coren, the deputy head of Oxford university's counselling service, who had given an interview to FHM about the causes of suicide, felt that he had been duped into appearing to give tacit approval to the magazine. </p> <p>\"Like the rest of us at the university he believes this is not a subject to be dealt with by sarcasm,\" an Oxford university spokeswoman said at the time. Oxford Brookes university also withdrew the guide. The NUS admitted it had \"made a mistake\" by allowing its commercial arm, NUS Services Ltd, to distribute the guide. A week later it announced that it was banning the magazine from all student unions and that FHM, along with other lads' magazines such as Loaded, would now be thoroughly vetted before any agreement about distribution was made in the future. </p> <p>\"I cannot find any good journalistic reason for the article,\" said Dr Roger Brown, the principal of Southampton institute. \"There is no public interest. What next? A jokey piece about how to construct a gas chamber?\" Every week there are 12 deaths by suicide in the university student age bracket. </p> <p>Brown wrote to Noguera. \"I believe the article is irresponsible and shows an unacceptable disregard for the personal grief of the students' family and friends. To write about these tragic events in such a flippant style can only add unnecessary pain.\" </p> <p>\"It was absolute filth, the worst type of gutter journalism,\" said Peter Gibson. \"This was distributed to young people, many of whom are away from home for the first time, and they might be lonely and insecure and here is a magazine that is producing this stuff to get new readers.\" </p> <p>The Napuks were similarly angered and distressed by the coverage. \"How anyone can think that this is a suitable subject for satire is beyond me,\" Mr Napuk said. </p> <p>The two families also wrote to the magazine demanding some answers. \"We are protesting in the strongest possible terms that the reports of the students' deaths were used to illustrate an issue of great gravity in a crass and callous way,\" Mr and Mrs Gibson wrote. \"We consider that it is a vile abuse of journalistic licence. As our son only died five months ago the wounds are very fresh.\" </p> <p>Noguera wrote back to the Gibsons. He started with an apology, saying that the magazine had \"no right to intrude upon your grief\". </p> <p>Then came the defence. \"The article was designed as a deterrent and a warning to students, written in a language and style that they understand,\" he wrote. \"Much of the discussion around this piece has taken the actual article wildly out of context and misrepresented much of what was in it. </p> <p>\"Of course we were not encouraging students to kill themselves. I must ask you to accept that whether you like FHM or not we know a lot about communicating with young people, especially men. You may not have appreciated the tone of the piece - and I fully appreciate that - but the majority of the target audience saw it for what it was. The piece sought to point out the horror and waste of suicide, specifically by citing case studies.\" </p> <p>Noguera pointed out that FHM had been \"commended on many occasions\" for writing about difficult subjects that are often ignored. He said that features on young men and leukaemia and testicular cancer had been particularly well received. </p> <p>\"We have done more to persuade men to talk about their problems, both medical and psychological, than anybody,\" he said. \"We communicate with men in a language and tone that they understand. It may seem insensitive and irreverent to you but it is by far the most effective way of getting the message across to our readers.\" </p> <p>The Samaritans has taken a close interest in the FHM publication. It knows it needs such magazines to get to one of the most vulnerable suicide groups, young men. Does such an irreverent take on suicide work? \"Young men do find it very difficult to articulate their emotions,\" says Simon Armson, chief executive of the Samaritans. \"If you can do anything to help then that is to be welcomed. The concern is over the means by which that is done. We have to be very careful indeed about trivialising the issue, it is a question of balance. FHM did not get the balance correct, it ran the risk of causing damage to those people who are already in a vulnerable state.\" </p> <p>Emap Metro, the publishers of FHM, is concerned about the bad publicity that may build when news of the adjudication becomes widely known. The NUS is likely to discuss banning the publication from its shop sites at its national conference at Easter. At a time when the lads' mag circulation bubble appears to be on the verge of bursting, such a move could be commercially damaging. </p> <p>In an attempt to spike any guns that may be massing, Philip Thomas, the managing director of FHM, also wrote to the Gibsons. \"That the tone and style of this recent piece overstepped the mark is an indication of the difficulties we face in covering these topics in the right manner,\" he said. \"I am truly sorry to have caused you distress and I know that everyone at FHM feels the same. Please accept my sincere apologies.\" Paul Keenan, the managing director of Emap, also wrote to the chairman of the PCC, Lord Wakeham, saying that he \"deeply regretted\" the articles. He said last week that FHM had \"learnt some hard lessons\". </p> <p>The Gibsons, who point out that FHM has been criticised before for its treatment of issues of mental health, and the Napuks are not convinced that the apologies amount to very much. \"I want to challenge them to make a proper, public apology to all of those affected,\" Mr Gibson said. All FHM is duty bound to publish is the adjudication itself, which is likely to appear in the March issue of the magazine. It remains to be seen whether it will go further than that and run a personal message from the editor. </p> <p>\"There should be lessons here for all the media,\" Mr Napuk said. \"The invasion into ordinary people's privacy has gone far too far. The excesses are sheer lunacy. In Sweden only [covering] the suicide of public figures is permissible, anyone who violates that rule is fined.

      "body": "<p>Some of the country's best-known journalists are joining forces to teach a 48-hour crash course in investigative reporting. We plan to turn our own stories inside out to expose the techniques we use. David Leigh is going to unpack the saga of Jonathan Aitken; Paul Foot will look back at notorious miscarriages of justice; John Ware will talk about his work on the secret state in Northern Ireland; and I am going to explain how I spent almost 18 months investigating a murderous paedophile ring and never got a word into print. </p> <p>It will all provide good anecdotes for the audience, but the aim is to achieve something more urgent. There are ominous signs that reporting skills are choking to death. If journalism had its own Chris Woodhead, sweeping through newsrooms with a black cloak and the power of inquisition, he would find plenty of brilliant and dedicated reporters, but he would also uncover a gathering sediment of incompetence. </p> <p>We have to acknowledge at the outset that, on the face of it, there are monkeys peeling bananas who have more skills than any reporter needs. After all, what do reporters do? They ask one lot of people questions and tell another lot of people the answers. In theory, they might need shorthand and typing; in practice, newsrooms are littered with people who can't do either. </p> <p>And yet it is precisely because reporting involves such a simple and commonplace exchange that the skills required are so peculiarly subtle and elusive. Take, for example, the simple business of persuading people to talk. Almost anyone with a story worth telling has a reason to withhold it, so when you turn up on the doorstep of the bent detective, or the parents whose child has just been murdered, or the MI5 officer whose colleagues are bending the law, you are confronted with a most intricate problem and, if the door opens, you will have between five and ten seconds to start to solve it and you are going to have to use some very unusual skills. </p> <p>I had been blown off dozens of doorsteps like so much old litter before I even began to realise that there were techniques to deploy here, let alone discovered what they were. And the closer you look at the reporter's role, the more hidden skills you see. </p> <p>There are technical skills involved in finding stories and all kinds of tricks to procure the sources you need to pursue them. There are old skills in exploiting public records; new ones such as using the internet as an investigative tool; grubby ones such as playing office politics to work on the story you want and get the space you need to run it. There are ethical questions, practical questions, such as staying safe or avoiding arrest or dealing with a leaks inquiry, and philosophical questions about truth and objectivity. </p> <p>If you succeed in gathering your facts then, in this country, a whole set of devious skills is required to negotiate the road to publication, which is blocked by laws of libel and contempt and official secrecy, all of them preserved by governments and courts which profit from their protection. The good news is that, at least to some extent, there are ways round them. </p> <p>The object is not simply to track down these skills but to preserve them in the face of extinction. We have described them as \"investigative reporting\" skills. That ought to be a nonsense, like saying that some water is special because it is wet. All reporting is supposed to be investigative.

      "bodyText": "Some of the country's best-known journalists are joining forces to teach a 48-hour crash course in investigative reporting. We plan to turn our own stories inside out to expose the techniques we use. David Leigh is going to unpack the saga of Jonathan Aitken; Paul Foot will look back at notorious miscarriages of justice; John Ware will talk about his work on the secret state in Northern Ireland; and I am going to explain how I spent almost 18 months investigating a murderous paedophile ring and never got a word into print. It will all provide good anecdotes for the audience, but the aim is to achieve something more urgent. There are ominous signs that reporting skills are choking to death. If journalism had its own Chris Woodhead, sweeping through newsrooms with a black cloak and the power of inquisition, he would find plenty of brilliant and dedicated reporters, but he would also uncover a gathering sediment of incompetence. We have to acknowledge at the outset that, on the face of it, there are monkeys peeling bananas who have more skills than any reporter needs. After all, what do reporters do? They ask one lot of people questions and tell another lot of people the answers. In theory, they might need shorthand and typing; in practice, newsrooms are littered with people who can't do either. And yet it is precisely because reporting involves such a simple and commonplace exchange that the skills required are so peculiarly subtle and elusive. Take, for example, the simple business of persuading people to talk. Almost anyone with a story worth telling has a reason to withhold it, so when you turn up on the doorstep of the bent detective, or the parents whose child has just been murdered, or the MI5 officer whose colleagues are bending the law, you are confronted with a most intricate problem and, if the door opens, you will have between five and ten seconds to start to solve it and you are going to have to use some very unusual skills. I had been blown off dozens of doorsteps like so much old litter before I even began to realise that there were techniques to deploy here, let alone discovered what they were. And the closer you look at the reporter's role, the more hidden skills you see. There are technical skills involved in finding stories and all kinds of tricks to procure the sources you need to pursue them. There are old skills in exploiting public records; new ones such as using the internet as an investigative tool; grubby ones such as playing office politics to work on the story you want and get the space you need to run it. There are ethical questions, practical questions, such as staying safe or avoiding arrest or dealing with a leaks inquiry, and philosophical questions about truth and objectivity. If you succeed in gathering your facts then, in this country, a whole set of devious skills is required to negotiate the road to publication, which is blocked by laws of libel and contempt and official secrecy, all of them preserved by governments and courts which profit from their protection. The good news is that, at least to some extent, there are ways round them. The object is not simply to track down these skills but to preserve them in the face of extinction. We have described them as \"investigative reporting\" skills. That ought to be a nonsense, like saying that some water is special because it is wet. All reporting is supposed to be investigative. At the most mundane level, it means simply that reporters should not print information just because someone claims it is true. At its most powerful, it means that news is what someone somewhere is deliberately concealing, and the reporter is consciously and rightly subversive. As currently practised, however, the investigative skills of reporting are withering. There are reporters in Fleet Street and the provincial press who have not spent a single day learning their trade, who recycle political spin and PR fiction simply because they couldn't find an angle in a five-cornered room. Worse than that, there are middle-ranking executives with no training who commission this stuff without realising that it is not journalism. There are Fleet Street editors who seriously think that an investigation consists of a particularly heavy lunch with Max Clifford, followed by a bout of creative writing in the company chequebook.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Kelvin MacKenzie is clutching a red Talk Radio mug and roaring at the photographer. Britain's one-man PR machine is loving every moment. \"Am I going to look handsome or not?\" he shouts. \"Come on. I know your tricks, you're not going to take one of those photos looking up my nose. At my age [he's 53] I'm not having all my double chins on display.\" </p> <p>It's just over a year since the former Sun editor turned wannabe entrepreneur took over Talk Radio in a \u00a324.7m deal. It remains the weakest national commercial station. After sacking almost every presenter he inherited, including Anna Raeburn, (just before Christmas - \"she just didn't fit in\") and suddenly throwing the South African test match at listeners, he was rewarded in November with a 17% drop in listeners, to 1.8m. </p> <p>But, by way of two further deals, he has also added 16 local music stations to his radio empire: in Scotland, the north west around Manchester, and Wales. After a total \u00a390m of spending, the renamed Wireless Company, backed by Rupert Murdoch who holds a 20% share, is vying to be the UK's fourth largest radio group. </p> <p>Even though two of the three acquisitions are still losing money, to the tune of \u00a35-6m annually, MacKenzie, acutely interested in riches, says he is planning to float it, offering some shares to the public later this year or in early 2001, City estimates suggest it might be worth around \u00a3200m. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Talk's audience losses - 450,000 over the year from slots throughout the day - have privately delighted his sworn enemy, the BBC's Radio 5 Live, whose audiences MacKenzie is after. So is it time for a reckoning? </p> <p>After the bluster has died away, MacKenzie, who bet his own capital on success, has something of an admission to make. \"I've made some errors,\" he says. \"We've done some good things, we've done some bad things. When I first came, I wish I had jammed a lot more sport in. From the day I arrived. Right? But when I came in first of all, I wanted to learn. It's all very well backing your hunches, but in terms of tens of millions of millions [of pounds] running on it, you tend to be cautious. And I wish I had gone down the sports route faster . . . but nothing is going to stop us now.\" </p> <p>How long did it take for the penny to drop that Talk's future lay in football? \"I don't know. I liked the sports phone-ins. And then competing with the BBC on news talk (his original plan) is a difficult beast, because it has so many resources and can send people to far-flung places.\" </p> <p>MacKenzie's company is quitting its prestigious offices in Oxford Street, London, this week (something he said last year he wouldn't do) for the more anonymous Waterloo. The reason is more space at a cheaper rate. </p> <p>He needs the extra space because he has set up Impact, a national advertising sales house, to pump national advertising into his local stations, the main route for cutting losses at a time when radio advertising, up 12% in 1999, is slated for further strong growth. This is run by one of MacKenzie's most rated employees, Tim Bleakley, who leads a sharp sales team in a conventional manner. MacKenzie has the sense to leave him alone. </p> <p>So, you've been on a bit of a learning curve? \"It's true. I'm no genius.\" You didn't crack L!ve TV either. \"It was never going to work commercially. Never any possibility. Its base was too low. But it was great fun.\" </p> <p>If Talk's long-term future is sport, then much hangs on negotiations later this year for the radio rights to the Premier League from 2001. The rights are currently with Radio 5 Live. \"We'll bid, but won't get them, too expensive. Um . . . [there is a long pause . . . he sucks through his teeth]. That is the challenge, is it not? You have to decide if you wish to be a shareholder, get the opportunity to buy the shares this year. You decide.\" Which is a rather convoluted way of suggesting he will use money from a flotation to build up a war chest. </p> <p>His staff say one of MacKenzie's problems as chief executive is that he has no one to keep him under control, and to filter the five good ideas from the 20 he throws out. \"Good point. Um . . . you know that is absolutely true, my failing is that I have too many ideas. Literally, I do. I come in here in the morning and sit down with my colleagues and say, right, I had this fantastic idea in the night. I have to get up and write them down. I did that in newspapers too, I have to get up. I can see they have to work very hard, make sure their eyes don't loll. And they always say, 'Where are we going to get the money for that?' And I always say, 'The Lord will provide.' </p> <p>\"Anyway, it's better to have ideas than to have none. Go to any live wire company today and they will have more ideas than capital. The day they have more capital than ideas, fire the chief executive.\" </p> <p>The question is whether things like test match cricket really work for Talk. England's play has hardly been magical. \"It is pretty tough to just put cricket into the schedule after it has been elsewhere for so many years. But the signal is sport, and live sport, and live sport makes great radio. It's got a nice sound to it. </p> <p>\"What I was amazed about when I first came here [in November 1998] was that we completely changed the schedule and our audience didn't move. In the third quarter [July/September 1999] 17% of them said farewell. In the fourth quarter we're ending up with a completely different audience: younger, male, less hours. So suddenly the audience get it and start liking it.\" </p> <p>The worry, however, is that with cricket dominating output since November 17, the audience could change yet again, and this time downwards. And young men, his target, also like to listen to FM radio, something which Talk cannot offer. \"Yes, but they like sport,\" MacKenzie says. </p> <p>Talk's coverage has, so far, won plaudits from listeners for the quality of its commentators - the controversial Geoff Boycott, Mark Nicholas, Chris Cowdrey and Bob Woolmer, the former South African coach. The radio industry is also impressed. \"It has done him good,\" says a rival. </p> <p>Talk put it together themselves without help from close allies Sky (\"It's not rocket science\") and MacKenzie denies there is any link, cooperation or cross promotion between Talk and Murdoch companies. He won't know until February 3 and the next set of ratings figures how the cricket performed in terms of audience. \"If I had to bet, we'll get some people in, some people out. When the cricket ends, we go back to normal schedule.\" But he is certain of one thing - Talk's audience will be back over 2m. </p> <p>\"We'll do more cricket in the summer, four-day cricket, one-day games.\" There are those who wonder if MacKenzie, ever experimental, plans to spread sports coverage from Talk to his local stations. </p> <p>\"They're two different businesses. People shouldn't confuse music and speech. They are completely different. To run a 24-hour speech station is actually a much tougher proposition than running a music station.\" </p> <p>The only possible exception is the under-unexploited franchise for Scot FM, which might get a MacKenzie-style revamp. But nothing will be done on the hoof. Meanwhile, his megaphone and highly personalised campaign against the BBC continues unabated. He really sees himself as a David against a Goliath, campaigning for the end of the licence fee: \"They enjoy taking taxpayers' money then appropriating to themselves some kind of genius by knocking me out of the ring. And when I tried to explain this to the dimwits on the [culture, media and sport] select committee [investigating the digital licence fee] they honestly could not understand it. One woman said to me, 'What about society?' I had to control myself, I was going to say to her, 'Well actually my little lovely, it's not society losing all this money, it's me.' The BBC is like royalty. Their time is past, but nobody has told the old dears.\" </p> <p>As for Greg Dyke and the BBC? \"When I saw this great list of the good and the great wrestling for this position, it was beyond my thought processes why anyone would want to do it. John Birt has been a bloody great problem for me, I can't believe under Dyke it will be any easier.\" </p> <p>MacKenzie looks positively pink with pleasure at the thought of extending the attack.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Sue Douglas is posing for a photo-shoot in the black and white checked executive boardroom at Cond\u00e9 Nast, where she has recently been appointed director of a re-suited and re-booted new media department. The former editor of the Sunday Express and senior executive of the Barclay Brothers' newspaper empire is blending in rather well with her new surroundings - looking for all the world like the techno-empowered ABC1 modern woman she is trying to reach with the new Vogue.com, which launches in April. </p> <p>New media chic has officially arrived at Vogue House. The little black dress and Tatler's little black book are about to be joined by the little black palm top with detachable mobile phone (Vogue's own brand). </p> <p>Douglas does not have a new media background. She has had one of the most varied and well-recounted careers in journalism, serving as the inspiration for heroines of hack-soap fiction. She is perceived by former colleagues to be charming (lethally so), extremely capable and truculent, when pressed. After being pushed from the Sunday Express in 1996, she has turned her back on editing for consultancy roles. </p> <p>When Jonathan Newhouse, chairman of Cond\u00e9 Nast International, offered Douglas the job on a consultancy basis, she told him she was \"a technophobe\". \"But the internet is no longer dominated by City boys trying to make money and nerds,\" she says. Just look at how many women are using email now and mobile phones - what will happen when everybody starts logging on via their mobiles? \"But it will never take over from other forms of publishing; it is just another medium.\" </p> <p>A medium which, with a bit of imported old-world glamour and new-world commerce, could be extremely profitable. If Douglas can turn the flagging Cond\u00e9 Nast Online around, the Elysian fields of upmarket online publishing could be hers. </p> <p>Apart from Vogue.com - which, after it is merged with the American site to form a global-style portal, promises to be as different from the rather parochial Vogue.co.uk as Popeye before and after spinach - there are six other titles to tackle: GQ, Tatler, Traveller, Vanity Fair, World of Interiors and, finally, Brides, to launch at the end of February. </p> <p>Cond\u00e9 Nast poured money away down the black hole that was the early internet. It was one of the first publishers to brave it online as early as 1996, with a low-level presence to boost subscriptions and a staff of three, backed by Microsoft. Apprehensions about the unknown market - not least the common fear that they would lose readers if they could get it free on the net - stymied any great developments, but, even at subsistence, the site was costly to sustain. </p> <p>Dan Conaghan, the first editor of Cond\u00e9 Nast Online, is now in charge of new business at New Media. With Nicholas Coleridge, the managing director, he sketched out on a piece of paper the idea for \"the eighth magazine\", an internet-exclusive brand which never came to fruition. \"Cond\u00e9 Nast in the UK is choosing to focus on its main magazine brand and build a site around that brand,\" he says, fearing they run the risk of not having enough money to sustain their vision. \"Cond\u00e9 Nast as a publisher is unique in not seeing an exit in raising capital from outside and always having to dig deeper in its own pockets.\" </p> <p>Cond\u00e9 Nast reported an online revenue of \u00a35m last year, an 83% increase in the number of banner adverts, and 10m page impressions. Advertisers are, apparently, \"desperate\" to get into the new brass-knobs-on Vogue.com. The upward trend is encouraging, but is it enough to justify a \u00a33m revamp, including five new members of staff, and a new editor, Abigail Chisman? </p> <p>New media analyst Rebecca Ulphe, from Fletcher research, believes the offensive has been \"prompted by the recent launch of women's portals\". The competition is not just from other publishing houses, but from internet service providers such as Freeserve, newspaper groups (Hollinger and Associated with Handbag.com, and Charlotte Street.com respectively), and even Microsoft Network. \"If you told Cond\u00e9 Nast they would be competing with Miscrosoft a year ago they would have laughed,\" she says. </p> <p>The biggest challenge Cond\u00e9 Nast faces is not that it is starting late, but that its current readers might not be geared up for e-commerce. Fewer than one third of British women who buy magazines use the internet. The vast majority of Vogue and GQ users are in the top income bracket, however, and one in three have bought something over the net. \"They have a very good opportunity here,\" says Ulphe. \"They know their niche and how valuable their readers are.\" </p> <p>It will not be difficult to steal the editorial edge from the women's networks, which have been criticised for trying to be all things to all people. There will be no question of stretching the Cond\u00e9 Nast brands to include a wider audience, says Douglas. \"The disadvantage for all these other pretenders is that nobody knows who they are. I mean, is it Charlotte Street or Berwick Street? At least we have the nuts and bolts in place.\" </p> <p>Douglas is confident current readers will use Vogue.com, but hopes to attract a new generation of young women who might not buy the magazine but would surf the site and use the chat-room. With young audiences already so sophisticated, however, they need plenty of new attractions. </p> <p>The first of these will arrive in February when London fashion week will be broadcast live from the site, as will New York and Paris. There will be daily fashion news (currently the most visited part of the site), and a glitterati events page - like an animated Hello!, where you can zero in on celebrities' facial blemishes - will follow. A virtual shopping assistant to guide users around the site is being discussed. A Vogue.com internet cafe will also be opening soon. </p> <p>The next stage is Vogue email - users can define who they are by putting the name of the most famous fashion magazine in the world after their own - and (a long way off in internet terms, maybe six months) Vogue mobile phones. Customisation is the marketing mantra of the American Cond\u00e9net, but brand extension is still a dirty word for many at Vogue House, so Douglas treads carefully. </p> <p>\"Cond\u00e9 Nast UK will not lose its British character or sophistication,\" says Douglas firmly. The American site is decidedly aimed at the shopping mall market with a dating agency, Swoon.com, a health and fitness brand called PHYS, and Epicurious, a food channel that has a lucrative television deal. \"If our readers want that, they will have to click through to the American site.\" If masthead television - something Nicholas Coleridge was wary of 18 months ago - happens, it will happen through the site. </p> <p>GQ is staying as it is online: a cursory presence with a gallery of gorgeous cover girls to surf through, and editorial content reduced to a teaser. Tatler will remain inimitably Tatler with lists of the best hotels, restaurants, A-list party-goers, upper-class crumpet: \"the definitive Metropolitan guide\". </p> <p>There is some talk of an interactive TV partnership for Vanity Fair with Channel 4, and a deal has just been signed with the Wedding Channel in the US, who will have a 40% stake in Brides. Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveller's site is relatively advanced with inside track editorial and online booking already available. But, on the whole, the outlook is conservative. </p> <p>E-commerce is an area Cond\u00e9 Nast is treating with caution. \"Everyone has just jumped in at the deep end and publishers have tried to become retailers. Some have got their fingers burned,\" says Douglas (namely Elle, which is struggling to ship goods customers have ordered). </p> <p>With Vogue.com, Douglas aims to close the 18-month evolutionary time lag that separates Europe and America. Joan Feeney, editorial director of Cond\u00e9net, said at the launch of US Vogue.com in October: \"The moment has finally arrived when the technology, the audience, the marketplace and the fashion world are ready and primed for a site like Vogue.com.\" The same could already apply to the British market. </p> <p>\"The atmosphere of excitement is tangible,\" says Douglas, thrilled to have discovered the hang-out of the New Media IT crowd is in the lobby bar of London's Claridges Hotel. There, the technorati drink cocktails, flash mobiles and talk web ventures with the conviction they will happen. Venture capital rather than editorial favours is the big game. \"It's hilarious,\" says Douglas. \"Just like the Groucho club used to be - the 80s all over again.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sue Douglas is posing for a photo-shoot in the black and white checked executive boardroom at Cond\u00e9 Nast, where she has recently been appointed director of a re-suited and re-booted new media department. The former editor of the Sunday Express and senior executive of the Barclay Brothers' newspaper empire is blending in rather well with her new surroundings - looking for all the world like the techno-empowered ABC1 modern woman she is trying to reach with the new Vogue.com, which launches in April. New media chic has officially arrived at Vogue House. The little black dress and Tatler's little black book are about to be joined by the little black palm top with detachable mobile phone (Vogue's own brand). Douglas does not have a new media background. She has had one of the most varied and well-recounted careers in journalism, serving as the inspiration for heroines of hack-soap fiction. She is perceived by former colleagues to be charming (lethally so), extremely capable and truculent, when pressed. After being pushed from the Sunday Express in 1996, she has turned her back on editing for consultancy roles. When Jonathan Newhouse, chairman of Cond\u00e9 Nast International, offered Douglas the job on a consultancy basis, she told him she was \"a technophobe\". \"But the internet is no longer dominated by City boys trying to make money and nerds,\" she says. Just look at how many women are using email now and mobile phones - what will happen when everybody starts logging on via their mobiles? \"But it will never take over from other forms of publishing; it is just another medium.\" A medium which, with a bit of imported old-world glamour and new-world commerce, could be extremely profitable. If Douglas can turn the flagging Cond\u00e9 Nast Online around, the Elysian fields of upmarket online publishing could be hers. Apart from Vogue.com - which, after it is merged with the American site to form a global-style portal, promises to be as different from the rather parochial Vogue.co.uk as Popeye before and after spinach - there are six other titles to tackle: GQ, Tatler, Traveller, Vanity Fair, World of Interiors and, finally, Brides, to launch at the end of February. Cond\u00e9 Nast poured money away down the black hole that was the early internet. It was one of the first publishers to brave it online as early as 1996, with a low-level presence to boost subscriptions and a staff of three, backed by Microsoft. Apprehensions about the unknown market - not least the common fear that they would lose readers if they could get it free on the net - stymied any great developments, but, even at subsistence, the site was costly to sustain. Dan Conaghan, the first editor of Cond\u00e9 Nast Online, is now in charge of new business at New Media. With Nicholas Coleridge, the managing director, he sketched out on a piece of paper the idea for \"the eighth magazine\", an internet-exclusive brand which never came to fruition. \"Cond\u00e9 Nast in the UK is choosing to focus on its main magazine brand and build a site around that brand,\" he says, fearing they run the risk of not having enough money to sustain their vision. \"Cond\u00e9 Nast as a publisher is unique in not seeing an exit in raising capital from outside and always having to dig deeper in its own pockets.\" Cond\u00e9 Nast reported an online revenue of \u00a35m last year, an 83% increase in the number of banner adverts, and 10m page impressions.

      "body": "<p>Across hours and hours of television output, \"white\" and \"English\" are words that are rarely heard. It's even rarer to see them together. And yet the white English are the biggest group in Britain, the silent majority. They have become a race that dare not speak its name. Could it be that in our politically correct culture we're ignoring the ethnic majority and actually not making enough programmes about how white people feel? </p> <p>I wanted to send Darcus Howe around Britain in search of the White Tribe - a tribe lost and, in some cases, even ashamed to be English. But it took a long time to get the idea off the ground. Strangely, I was met with a mix of apathy and disbelief from commissioning editors: \"Sorry, this isn't for me\"; \"Most of our programmes are about white people already\"; \"Isn't this just divisive - how can you regard whites as a race?\"; and \"Darcus who?\" were typical responses. </p> <p>Even amongst those broadcasters who could see that this was a fresh idea, there seemed to be a nervousness about commissioning a \"black\" series with a mainstream vision. They could see that there was a need for multicultural output but were locked into an old way of thinking. For them, multicultural meant programmes made by black people for black people about black subjects. </p> <p>But one broadcaster did get it - Michael Jackson, chief executive of Channel 4. \"At last a series about my people,\" he said ironically. He also liked the idea of an authored journey with Darcus - a man closely associated with the black cause, leaving his home territory of Brixton and going off to meet whites in trouble: the former panther meets \"the enemy\", armed this time with tea and sympathy. </p> <p>White Tribe, for me, is a radical format. For centuries the white man has gone to the dark continent to investigate the strange rites and rituals of a black tribe. This time we've reversed that and sent a black man to England to meet its ethnic majority, the whites. </p> <p>Our real intention was to re-define what multicultural television should be in the new century. There's no reason why multicultural programmes should focus only on people with dark skin and life in the ghettos. Rather, its real future lies in the opportunities it provides for fresh perspectives on subjects that are often the preserve of \"whites\". When did you last see three hours of primetime television on a significant issue fronted by a black man who is not a chef, stand-up comic or a footballer? </p> <p>There's a wide range of subject areas that can be re-invented and re-vitalised by looking through the multicultural prism. In Love In Leeds, a series I made last year for Channel 4, we took a universal theme - love - and gave it a multicultural spin. By reversing conventional documentary casting, replacing the token black with a token white, we gave romance a new lick of paint with surprising results. </p> <p>In White Tribe, Englishness gets the Darcus treatment. He argues that the English are lost, demoralised and even ashamed to admit who they are. He confronts a tribe that prefers vindaloo to fish and chips, chooses coffee rather than tea, but still blames the rest of the world for its slow demise. It's a world in which to be white and proud is a contradiction in terms. Even the future king looks like a wigger - a white nigger - with his baseball cap back to front. </p> <p>One example reveals some of the difficulties of making this type of multicultural television. On one occasion we filmed Darcus moving cautiously through the grey, rundown streets of an Oldham housing estate, looking left and then right. He was the only black man for miles. This was a white space, do not disturb. Asian families have tried living here but have not lasted long. </p> <p>Darcus was visibly shocked by the views of the residents who consider themselves an ethnic minority in a town where they make up 90% of the population: \"Us whites are second-class citizens now\"; \"Get one family in, and before you know it the estate is over-run by them\"; \"It's a white estate, and it'll stay a white estate\"; \"We're supposed to be Great Britain, but all the great has gone\". </p> <p>These encounters are going to upset some people and - as someone who has suffered personally from racial violence - I thought a lot about whether to include them. The argument that we might be providing a platform for the far right was taken seriously, but was ultimately dismissed. </p> <p>The reason? Well, I wanted to see whether it was possible for people in places like Oldham to be white and proud but not racist - after all, it is possible for me to be Asian and proud, and for Darcus to be black and proud. But sadly, there is a thin line between English nationalism and racism. </p> <p>People struggle to describe their Englishness in positive terms. They often resort to negatives. Uncertain of themselves, they attack others. This is why we used the comments, to reveal that very point. </p> <p>Personally, I don't see anything wrong with people on television describing their feelings about other ethnic groups, as long as they are challenged - though I draw the line at including contributors who seek to incite racial violence. </p> <p>One woman interviewed by Darcus expressed support for the nail bomber who terrorised minorities in London last year. We had no qualms about removing her contribution. </p> <p>But, in general, the sense of injustice felt by members of every community in Britain should be explored on television - and that includes white victims. It seems to me that we as programme-makers tend to exercise a kind of self-censorship when it comes to certain forms of racism, almost as if it's exclusively ethnic minorities who find themselves on the receiving end of a type of prejudice and discrimination. </p> <p>As Darcus's journey shows, this country has been completely transformed by immigration and globalisation. We're no longer so sure who the victims are, what black and white means, and ultimately what it is to be English. We're in a state of flux, living in a pick-and-mix culture. In this new landscape, multicultural no longer needs to be dull and worthy or confined to ghetto subjects. We have to move it in to primetime. We're all multicultural now. </p> <p>Narinder Minhas is joint head of programmes at Diverse Production, and executive producer of White Tribe which will be shown on Channel 4, Thursday, 9pm.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Hundreds of column inches were dedicated at the weekend to the news that Granada just might want to take part in the consolidation of ITV. </p> <p>What a surprise! Granada's Gerry Robinson and Charles Allen have been telling anyone who will listen that the commercial logic of a single ITV was inescapable; and who better to run it than the key executives of Britain's most successful commercial terrestrial broadcaster, Granada? </p> <p>But how much closer to the prize did the two men come on Friday, with their announcement that Granada is considering a bid for either Carlton or United? Not very. This was a matter of putting down a marker rather than making a real move on either target company. Granada wants to be seen as a contender for the mantle of ITV chief, and with it the \u00a31.8bn in advertising revenues generated by the Channel 3 companies. But it is not yet ready to run risks by mounting a bid that faces huge regulatory obstacles. </p> <p>The message was meant for a wide public, including the City, Whitehall, Westminster, the Office of Fair Trading and the head offices of Michael Green's Carlton and Lord Hollick's United News &amp; Media. The daily newspapers, the Sundays, the Today programme, Channel 4 news - all the media outlets duly complied, giving Robinson and Allen huge publicity for essentially saying: \"We'd like to have a go too, please.\" </p> <p> The announcement was aimed at allowing Granada to recover from a virulent case of wrong-footedness. Last November, Carlton and United announced they intended to merge to form an \u00a38bn media giant, controlling all the regional ITV licences south of Granada's Yorkshire (with the exception, of course, of Granada's London Weekend Television).

Granada could certainly afford to pay a premium for the more desirable of the two companies, Carlton, whose shares are trading at a significant discount to their fundamental value. A break-up bid might value Carlton at more than \u00a38 a share, compared to the \u00a36 or so implied by the terms of the Carlton-United merger.

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of column inches were dedicated at the weekend to the news that Granada just might want to take part in the consolidation of ITV. What a surprise! Granada's Gerry Robinson and Charles Allen have been telling anyone who will listen that the commercial logic of a single ITV was inescapable; and who better to run it than the key executives of Britain's most successful commercial terrestrial broadcaster, Granada? But how much closer to the prize did the two men come on Friday, with their announcement that Granada is considering a bid for either Carlton or United? Not very. This was a matter of putting down a marker rather than making a real move on either target company. Granada wants to be seen as a contender for the mantle of ITV chief, and with it the \u00a31.8bn in advertising revenues generated by the Channel 3 companies. But it is not yet ready to run risks by mounting a bid that faces huge regulatory obstacles. The message was meant for a wide public, including the City, Whitehall, Westminster, the Office of Fair Trading and the head offices of Michael Green's Carlton and Lord Hollick's United News &amp; Media. The daily newspapers, the Sundays, the Today programme, Channel 4 news - all the media outlets duly complied, giving Robinson and Allen huge publicity for essentially saying: \"We'd like to have a go too, please.\" The announcement was aimed at allowing Granada to recover from a virulent case of wrong-footedness. Last November, Carlton and United announced they intended to merge to form an \u00a38bn media giant, controlling all the regional ITV licences south of Granada's Yorkshire (with the exception, of course, of Granada's London Weekend Television). That merger would go against the rules - specifically undertakings agreed five years ago, during an earlier frenzied round of ITV consolidation, that no single company would claim more than 25% of national advertising revenues. Carlton and United combined would represent at least 36%. On another important regulatory measure - share of television audience - Carlton and United could just squeeze through, as they together would represent 14.9% of the national audience, compared to the ceiling of 15% (excluding their stakes in GMTV and Channel 5).

The reported \u00a375,000 to \u00a3100,000 bonuses the Network Centre team stood to earn in 1999 were linked to performance in ITV's definition of peak-time. Why? Why not its total audience share? Cynics would say because total share is in long-term unstoppable decline, and the team can only be \"incentivised\" by offering them a realistic target. </p> <p>So ITV created a definition of peak-time that excluded the awkward 6-7pm hour, and said it would increase its share within it, even at the expense of losing share off-peak. And so last year overall share duly dropped by 0.5% even as peak share rose by 1% (not quite the promised 1.2%). </p> <p>A con? Or a good result? Advertisers are not fools. They clearly want bigger audiences in peak-time, even if shifting resources into achieving this is at the expense of viewership off-peak. Delivering mass volumes of people who see an advertisement at least once is ITV's unique selling proposition. Other channels can fill in the gaps, or build up multiple viewership of campaigns. </p> <p>ITV was rewarded with a reported extra \u00a3100m of revenue last year as a result of this. Meanwhile, other channels picked up ratings points at times when ITV was competing less vigorously, and so also increased revenues. In business jargon: \"win-win\". Which is why I would echo Wilfred Pickles and say: \"Give 'em the money, Mabel!\" </p> <p>Incentives can also work in the BBC. After a year of the governors and John Birt insisting that a nine-month handover to his successor was essential in an organisation as complex as the BBC, the simple device of a peerage seems enough to have induced his premature departure (presumably, a delay of the announcement until the summer's birthday honours would have so undermined the workings of the House of Lords that it was worth disrupting our national broadcaster to avoid it). </p> <p>Curiously, the story announcing the early Birt bath concentrated on the impending cull of BBC management that Greg Dyke would swiftly undertake, to be followed by the exile of the consultants, the re-drawing of the Broadcast/Production split, the abandonment of bi-media ideology in News, etc. If the reward for getting so much so wrong is a barony, we must surely expect a Duke Dyke to be unveiled if Greg survives five years. </p> <p>Even the centrepiece of the Birt DG-ship is unravelling: his digital strategy. Greg himself paid obeisance to the achievements of BBC Online when he was appointed. But it is perverse to judge the success of an organisation on 1% of its spending, and not the other 99%. Meanwhile, News 24 was given a drubbing by the Commons Culture Committee, and the BBC's most consistent supporters have had little good to say about BBC Choice. </p> <p>The established wisdom is that the Commons Committee is made up of anti-BBC oddballs, with none odder than its outspoken chairman, Gerald Kaufman. Such an assumption does not survive a reading of the Committee's report. Even those of us who disagree with some of the Kaufman conclusions have to admit he is a master of detail and an enemy of humbug. He offers a simple and effective mechanism for implementing the free TV licence for over-75s. He ruthlessly demonstrates that the BBC's response to the Davies Report is substantially at odds with its (unpublished) evidence to Davies just a few months earlier. \"Sketchy at best\" is his damning summary of the BBC's claims for additional expenditure on new services. As for a much expanded role in the digital era and additional funding, the BBC had \"singularly failed to make the case\". </p> <p> However, he has failed to spot the absurdities in the NERA Report commissioned by the commercial lobby, and so takes at face value its laughable predictions that a digital licence fee would significantly slow digital take-up and delay analogue switch-off. The million homes that have gone digital in the past six months have clearly not been deterred by the prospect of the Davies Report being implemented. </p> <p>Kaufman's most effective argument against the digital licence fee is that the BBC's contribution to the digital proposition is too modest to justify a compulsory payment by digital households for its digital services. But he is equally adamant that no increase in the general licence fee should be authorised to fund the BBC's digital ambitions, and rejects any thought of re-opening the five-year licence settlement. He devastatingly cites the BBC's own statements - in support of the five-year deal, in opposition to a digital licence fee, in pledging digital services at no extra cost - to deflate its vision. </p> <p>A muddled digital strategy, poorly implemented, is scarcely what John Birt would have chosen as his legacy. There is much to be applauded from his 13 years at the BBC. Even so, we should remember that incentives are used to persuade failed managers to leave as well as successful ones to continue. Just as well they work.</p>",

The reported \u00a375,000 to \u00a3100,000 bonuses the Network Centre team stood to earn in 1999 were linked to performance in ITV's definition of peak-time. Why? Why not its total audience share? Cynics would say because total share is in long-term unstoppable decline, and the team can only be \"incentivised\" by offering them a realistic target. So ITV created a definition of peak-time that excluded the awkward 6-7pm hour, and said it would increase its share within it, even at the expense of losing share off-peak. And so last year overall share duly dropped by 0.5% even as peak share rose by 1% (not quite the promised 1.2%). A con? Or a good result? Advertisers are not fools. They clearly want bigger audiences in peak-time, even if shifting resources into achieving this is at the expense of viewership off-peak. Delivering mass volumes of people who see an advertisement at least once is ITV's unique selling proposition. Other channels can fill in the gaps, or build up multiple viewership of campaigns. ITV was rewarded with a reported extra \u00a3100m of revenue last year as a result of this. Meanwhile, other channels picked up ratings points at times when ITV was competing less vigorously, and so also increased revenues. In business jargon: \"win-win\". Which is why I would echo Wilfred Pickles and say: \"Give 'em the money, Mabel!\" Incentives can also work in the BBC. After a year of the governors and John Birt insisting that a nine-month handover to his successor was essential in an organisation as complex as the BBC, the simple device of a peerage seems enough to have induced his premature departure (presumably, a delay of the announcement until the summer's birthday honours would have so undermined the workings of the House of Lords that it was worth disrupting our national broadcaster to avoid it). Curiously, the story announcing the early Birt bath concentrated on the impending cull of BBC management that Greg Dyke would swiftly undertake, to be followed by the exile of the consultants, the re-drawing of the Broadcast/Production split, the abandonment of bi-media ideology in News, etc. If the reward for getting so much so wrong is a barony, we must surely expect a Duke Dyke to be unveiled if Greg survives five years. Even the centrepiece of the Birt DG-ship is unravelling: his digital strategy. Greg himself paid obeisance to the achievements of BBC Online when he was appointed. But it is perverse to judge the success of an organisation on 1% of its spending, and not the other 99%. Meanwhile, News 24 was given a drubbing by the Commons Culture Committee, and the BBC's most consistent supporters have had little good to say about BBC Choice. The established wisdom is that the Commons Committee is made up of anti-BBC oddballs, with none odder than its outspoken chairman, Gerald Kaufman. Such an assumption does not survive a reading of the Committee's report. Even those of us who disagree with some of the Kaufman conclusions have to admit he is a master of detail and an enemy of humbug. He offers a simple and effective mechanism for implementing the free TV licence for over-75s. He ruthlessly demonstrates that the BBC's response to the Davies Report is substantially at odds with its (unpublished) evidence to Davies just a few months earlier. \"Sketchy at best\" is his damning summary of the BBC's claims for additional expenditure on new services. As for a much expanded role in the digital era and additional funding, the BBC had \"singularly failed to make the case\". However, he has failed to spot the absurdities in the NERA Report commissioned by the commercial lobby, and so takes at face value its laughable predictions that a digital licence fee would significantly slow digital take-up and delay analogue switch-off. The million homes that have gone digital in the past six months have clearly not been deterred by the prospect of the Davies Report being implemented. Kaufman's most effective argument against the digital licence fee is that the BBC's contribution to the digital proposition is too modest to justify a compulsory payment by digital households for its digital services. But he is equally adamant that no increase in the general licence fee should be authorised to fund the BBC's digital ambitions, and rejects any thought of re-opening the five-year licence settlement. He devastatingly cites the BBC's own statements - in support of the five-year deal, in opposition to a digital licence fee, in pledging digital services at no extra cost - to deflate its vision. A muddled digital strategy, poorly implemented, is scarcely what John Birt would have chosen as his legacy. There is much to be applauded from his 13 years at the BBC. Even so, we should remember that incentives are used to persuade failed managers to leave as well as successful ones to continue. Just as well they work.",

If your illness lasts longer than the usual three to ten days, you should see your doctor. You should also get medical advice if you are at risk of developing complications.

      "body": "<p>Today's $250bn merger announcement between Time Warner and America Online provides the most dramatic proof yet of the breakdown of old and new media.</p> <p>For Time Warner, it has been a steady march from the traditional media of film and print new areas. Gerald Levin, the head of Time Warner brought CNN, the cable network into the Time Warner empire, seeking to cross-fertilise Time Warner's numerous publications with cable TV.</p> <p>Once thought of a bloodless technophile, Mr Levin has emerged as an audacious dealmaker. In his latest venture, Mr Levin is seeking to catapult Time Warner well and truly into the internet age, tapping the internet expertise of a new media company like AOL to leverage his company's traditional media assets.</p> <p>Other companies have been moving in this direction, notably Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. Mr Murdoch became an internet convert towards the end of last year and now wants his company to be at the cutting edge of the internet. His number two, Peter Chernin, is less focused on the company's heart, its newspaper business, than on its fast-growing divisions such as entertainment and the internet.</p> <p>Last month, Mr Chernin announced a $1bn alliance with Healtheon/WebMD, the online healthcare company.

      "bodyText": "Today's $250bn merger announcement between Time Warner and America Online provides the most dramatic proof yet of the breakdown of old and new media. For Time Warner, it has been a steady march from the traditional media of film and print new areas. Gerald Levin, the head of Time Warner brought CNN, the cable network into the Time Warner empire, seeking to cross-fertilise Time Warner's numerous publications with cable TV. Once thought of a bloodless technophile, Mr Levin has emerged as an audacious dealmaker. In his latest venture, Mr Levin is seeking to catapult Time Warner well and truly into the internet age, tapping the internet expertise of a new media company like AOL to leverage his company's traditional media assets. Other companies have been moving in this direction, notably Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. Mr Murdoch became an internet convert towards the end of last year and now wants his company to be at the cutting edge of the internet. His number two, Peter Chernin, is less focused on the company's heart, its newspaper business, than on its fast-growing divisions such as entertainment and the internet. Last month, Mr Chernin announced a $1bn alliance with Healtheon/WebMD, the online healthcare company. The deal signalled a new trend for traditional companies to leverage their huge marketing power to gain a stake in internet companies. Instead of accepting advertising fees from online groups desperate to increase brand awareness, media companies are demanding a stake in the company in return for space. As another example of the sort of cross-pollination Mr Chernin has in mind, News Corp plans to start a religious website linked to its Zondervan publishing interests. Mr Chernin also expects TV Guide, the magazine partly owned by News Corp, to rival Yahoo and America Online as a valuable media brand. Mr Levin has taken the process of convergence to another level altogether, by merging Time Warner with an internet company. Although AOL initially was ridiculed by internet purists, it has established itself as the dominant online service provider with 20m customers, and it boosted its internet credentials with its purchase last year of Netscape, which popularised the internet browser. By merging operations, Time Warner will have access to AOL's large customer base, while Yahoo will have access to Time Warner's content, which includes films, TV programmes and publications ranging from Time and Sports Illustrated to People and Entertainment Weekly. While other companies such as News Corp were looking at alliances with internet entities, Time Warner has decided to go all the way by throwing its lot in with AOL. This deal represents the second phase of mergers among media companies. In the first phase media companies merged with each other. Disney set the trend by buying the ABC television network, Viacom bought Paramount, the film studio, Time Warner hopped on the bandwagon and bought CNN.

Still, even though I went for some runs I also picked up three wickets, which is my job. </p> <p><strong>Dec 25</strong><br> We went down to Kingsmead to train at around 10.30am on Christmas Day. The nets were very soggy because of torrential rain so it was mostly indoors. Alan Mullally was having a fitness test in the car park - he was bowling from one end, then he decided to switch ends, said he wanted to come downwind.</p> <p> Got back in time for Christmas lunch - nothing too extravagant, just food and a couple of drinks, and then everyone went about their business. It was an important game the next day, plus all the guys had their girlfriends and families staying with them. All the guys, that is, apart from Graeme Swann. We told him he's a loner, but he doesn't mind - he takes it all with a pinch of salt.</p> <p> The system of having the wives and girlfriends out here for Christmas makes a lot of sense. They get some sun, we get a break from being with the other guys all the time, and everyone gets to catch up with each other.

      "bodyText": "Dec 18 East London: Combined Eastern Province/Border XI v England We fielded first, one of the hottest days since we've been here, and I had a chance to show that I'm still on this tour. In general, I felt I bowled really well - the ball was coming out nicely, and getting down there at good pace. There were just three overs later on when the ball got very sticky and I couldn't grip it properly. Their captain Strydom was able to get hold of a few then. Still, even though I went for some runs I also picked up three wickets, which is my job. Dec 25 We went down to Kingsmead to train at around 10.30am on Christmas Day. The nets were very soggy because of torrential rain so it was mostly indoors. Alan Mullally was having a fitness test in the car park - he was bowling from one end, then he decided to switch ends, said he wanted to come downwind. Got back in time for Christmas lunch - nothing too extravagant, just food and a couple of drinks, and then everyone went about their business. It was an important game the next day, plus all the guys had their girlfriends and families staying with them. All the guys, that is, apart from Graeme Swann. We told him he's a loner, but he doesn't mind - he takes it all with a pinch of salt. The system of having the wives and girlfriends out here for Christmas makes a lot of sense. They get some sun, we get a break from being with the other guys all the time, and everyone gets to catch up with each other. It can be hard to see them during the summer too, so it's very important that they get out to meet us over the winter.

      "bodyText": "Any football club, large or small, waiting for an FA committee to decide their fate can never be sure whether reason, expediency or sheer mindboggling doublethink will rule the day. Last year, when the spirit of the law was breached in Arsenal's FA Cup match against Sheffield United, a replay was deemed right and proper. On this occasion the spirit of Tranmere's 1-0 victory over Premiership Sunderland might suggest the FA should let the result stand. But replays have become the fashion and yesterday Adrian Bevington, one of the few FA spokesmen not in Brazil, made it clear that a second match was an option, even if his utterances amounted to little more than what Basil Fawlty famously called \"a statement of the bleedin' obvious\". This morning the FA Challenge Cup committee will bend its mighty collective mind to the problem, and Tranmere will fear the worst. Clearly there was a breach of the rules in extra-time, with the referee Rob Harris, the fourth official David Unsworth and the Tranmere management all culpable to some degree. John Aldridge, Tranmere's manager, unfortunately reacted rather like a recalcitrant schoolboy, claiming his club had done nothing wrong. \"If the officials can't do it right, it is nothing to do with our lads,\" he said. \"It was the last minute of the game.

      "bodyText": "Heads sure do roll in Sleepy Hollow, but they certainly aren't lost in love. Apart from the endless decapitations, Tim Burton's Hammer homage is also notable for the complete lack of onscreen chemistry between Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci. One scene in which Depp confesses to Ricci that she has \"bewitched\" him is delivered with as much feeling as one would reserve for a pickled onion, but there is a reason why the pair - dubbed the 'gothic Tracy and Hepburn' give a whole new meaning to word 'sang-froid'. At a recent press conference Depp said: \"I met Christina when she was nine years old and when you have to regard that person you met at the age of nine as a love interest it's a little uncomfortableunsettling. Working on Sleepy Hollow we gradually allowed ourselves to get to the stage where it wasn't so...twisted.\" Cate Blanchett in line for Hannibal After a week of uncertainty and intense speculation, it seems certain that Hannibal, the sequel to The Silence of the Lambs, will definitely not star Jodie Foster. Studio executives had contemplated abandoning the project altogether when producer Dino De Laurentiis offered to pay back the $10 million spent by Universal on book and script costs, but it now seems likely the studio will go ahead with the film, and will make an offer to Cate Blanchett to play the female lead of FBI agent Clarice Starling.

The last Pope to resign willingly was Celestine V, who stepped down in 1294. Gregory XII reluctantly abdicated in 1415 in order to resolve a dispute when there was more than one Pope reigning at the same time.</p> <p>\"It is naturally difficult to imagine such a situation.

      "bodyText": "A leading German bishop sparked outrage in Italy today by suggesting that the Pope should retire if his health deteriorates further. Bishop Karl Lehmann, president of the German bishops conference, was speaking on the Cologne-based Deutschlandfunk radio station when he made the comments about John Paul II, who is believed to have Parkinson's disease. \"I have confidence in the Pope that when he feels he is no longer capable of leading the Church with responsibility, he will have the strength and the courage to say: 'I cannot fulfil this (charge) as is required',\" he said. Although his comments were heavily qualified, they were carried in big headlines in most Italian newspapers. Bishop Lehmann's remarks are even more controversial because, while the Pope's critics inside the church have made such remarks in the past, it was the first time it came from a powerful figure in an important European bishops conference. Popes usually reign for life. The last Pope to resign willingly was Celestine V, who stepped down in 1294. Gregory XII reluctantly abdicated in 1415 in order to resolve a dispute when there was more than one Pope reigning at the same time. \"It is naturally difficult to imagine such a situation. Nobody is used to the idea of a Pope stepping down. Nonetheless with Celestine V we have someone who has done that,\" Bishop Lehmann added. He said that even if an incapacitated Pope tried to step down, his aides probably would try to resist the idea. \"But if the Pope wanted to do that (retire), I am not sure whether the climate is right, and whether all those that give advice would agree and think it better that he should step down. It is still a sensitive time for the church,\" he said. The bishop noted that despite what is believed to be Parkinson's disease the Pope always displays an \"unbelievable presence of mind\" and there was no question at the moment that he was not fulfilling his Papal duties. The 79-year-old Pope, elected in 1978, last dismissed suggestions that he should resign in 1995, when he turned 75, the age at which Roman Catholic bishops usually hand in their resignation. \"I renew before Christ my willingness to serve the Church as long as he wants, abandoning myself completely to his holy will. I leave to him to decide when and how he wants to relieve me of this service,\" the Pope said at the time. Lehmann's words were met with incredulity in some Vatican quarters. \"No-one has the right to say that the Pope should step down for any reason,\" Cardinal Alfons Stickler, a Vatican-based Austrian, was quoted as saying in Monday's La Repubblica newspaper. Italian Cardinal Ersilio Tonini told La Stampa newspaper: \"I can't believe this, if it is true. I think the Pope is in full command of his functions. Above all, his mind is still totally free, totally unencumbered. The decisions still are all his.\" According to Canon 332 of church law, a Pope can resign, but since he is supreme pontiff, no one has to accept the resignation. The Canon reads: \"If it should happen that the Roman Pontiff resigns his office, it is required for validity that he makes the resignation freely and that it be duly manifested, but not that it be accepted by anyone.\" Useful sites The Vatican Deutschlandfunk Radio La Stampa La Repubblica",

Clearly the Greenwich experience is not the thumping world-class achievement that government propagandists, distorting prisms clamped to their eyes, are inviting us to believe.</p> <p>But neither is it the 100% certified fiasco now being acclaimed on the political right. \"Sponsors are appalled by dome chaos\"; \"Dome tickets flop forces big relaunch\", the Telegraph proudly proclaims on successive days on page one. On inside pages, columnists get to work. \"The orphan dome, the Oliver Twist of architectural disasters, will go down in posterity as one of the great bad jokes of British history, along with King Canute's failure to halt the tide, King John's loss of his baggage in the Wash, and the South Sea bubble\", burbles one overwrought soul in the Daily Mail. Two pages later, another writes of a \"criminal\" waste of resources. Yesterday, a fresh allegation emerged: the cash to meet the looming shortfall, up to \u00a323m, will be snatched from lottery money which would otherwise go to charities and other good causes.</p> <p>There is a hidden agenda here, of which those tempted to credit this kind of analysis ought to be made aware. The troubles with the Dome, the failures in organisation, the unhappiness of the sponsors, the fact that some of the punters are coming away disappointed, has come as a heaven-sent chance for the right, at a time when such chances are rare, to get back at all-conquering Labour. Persuade people, not just that this enterprise is a fiasco, but that is also somehow emblematic of the whole New Labour approach, and you might just begin to roll back some of that huge Labour lead which threatens an even bigger Blair majority in May 2001 or whenever. But what makes it even more juicy is the second dimension to this attack. If the Dome becomes established as a disaster, the blame will fall not only on Tony Blair and specifically on his first \"dome secretary\", Peter Mandelson, but on someone the Tory right tends to regard with even more venomous loathing: the great Europhile and assassin of Margaret Thatcher, Michael Heseltine. One could note on Saturday morning how the two columnists of the Mail carefully bracketed Messrs Mandelson and Heseltine together as what one of them called \"the Dome's putative fathers\". \"This monument to his vanity,\" said the other of Mr Heseltine, \"is the last entry on his list of failures, and just about the biggest.\" A Times leader made the same telling conjunction, nailing Mr Heseltine as the project's \"prime progenitor\", \"a long-time giganticist whose interest in size for its own sake was the hallmark of his career.\"</p> <p>The special joy of their campaign is that it may become self-fulfilling: by trumpeting it as a recognised fiasco from which the public is staying away, it is much more likely the project will fail. The certainty with which they condemn it seems all the more bogus in the light of a poll of more than 1,000 visitors to the Dome carried out (in circumstances inadequately specified) by the Sunday Times. Asked \"Did you enjoy it?\" 85% said they did. Was it good value for money? 62% said that it was. Would you recommend it to friends? 74% said they would. That hardly makes it a triumph, but it does underline how much of the rightwing comment now proceeds from political calculation, and malevolent and unscrupulous calculation at that.</p>",

On inside pages, columnists get to work. \"The orphan dome, the Oliver Twist of architectural disasters, will go down in posterity as one of the great bad jokes of British history, along with King Canute's failure to halt the tide, King John's loss of his baggage in the Wash, and the South Sea bubble\", burbles one overwrought soul in the Daily Mail. Two pages later, another writes of a \"criminal\" waste of resources. Yesterday, a fresh allegation emerged: the cash to meet the looming shortfall, up to \u00a323m, will be snatched from lottery money which would otherwise go to charities and other good causes. There is a hidden agenda here, of which those tempted to credit this kind of analysis ought to be made aware. The troubles with the Dome, the failures in organisation, the unhappiness of the sponsors, the fact that some of the punters are coming away disappointed, has come as a heaven-sent chance for the right, at a time when such chances are rare, to get back at all-conquering Labour. Persuade people, not just that this enterprise is a fiasco, but that is also somehow emblematic of the whole New Labour approach, and you might just begin to roll back some of that huge Labour lead which threatens an even bigger Blair majority in May 2001 or whenever. But what makes it even more juicy is the second dimension to this attack. If the Dome becomes established as a disaster, the blame will fall not only on Tony Blair and specifically on his first \"dome secretary\", Peter Mandelson, but on someone the Tory right tends to regard with even more venomous loathing: the great Europhile and assassin of Margaret Thatcher, Michael Heseltine. One could note on Saturday morning how the two columnists of the Mail carefully bracketed Messrs Mandelson and Heseltine together as what one of them called \"the Dome's putative fathers\". \"This monument to his vanity,\" said the other of Mr Heseltine, \"is the last entry on his list of failures, and just about the biggest.\" A Times leader made the same telling conjunction, nailing Mr Heseltine as the project's \"prime progenitor\", \"a long-time giganticist whose interest in size for its own sake was the hallmark of his career.\" The special joy of their campaign is that it may become self-fulfilling: by trumpeting it as a recognised fiasco from which the public is staying away, it is much more likely the project will fail. The certainty with which they condemn it seems all the more bogus in the light of a poll of more than 1,000 visitors to the Dome carried out (in circumstances inadequately specified) by the Sunday Times. Asked \"Did you enjoy it?\" 85% said they did. Was it good value for money? 62% said that it was. Would you recommend it to friends? 74% said they would. That hardly makes it a triumph, but it does underline how much of the rightwing comment now proceeds from political calculation, and malevolent and unscrupulous calculation at that.",

      "bodyText": "Chechen guerrilla forces, growing bolder as the savage Russian campaign in the north Caucasus stalls, counter-attacked on several fronts at the weekend while Moscow's political and military leadership appeared confused. After Moscow ordered an abrupt suspension of its offensive to capture Grozny, the Chechen capital, and fired two of its most senior commanders, Chechen rebels staged counter-attacks in and around Grozny, ambushed Russian checkpoints further south, and claimed to have retaken a town and village from the Russians. The Russian consensus behind the war, meanwhile, showed signs of eroding amid mounting Russian casualties and questioning of Moscow's tactics and strategy. In two northern districts of Grozny which the Russians said they controlled last week, the city's defenders struck back, sparking fierce fighting and causing the Russians to call in air support from helicopter gunships. Fifteen miles to the south, outside the village of Shali, the Russians confirmed losing at least two men in an attack on a checkpoint. The Itar-Tass news agency said that Chechen gunmen drove a bus to the checkpoint and when Russian interior ministry troops asked to see documents, the Chechens opened fire. A four-hour gun battle ensued during which two Russians were killed and one wounded. NTV, Russia's largest private television station, reported yesterday that the Chechens had retaken Shali. The station played a key role in turning public opinion against the last Chechen war in 1994-96 and is slowly becoming more critical this time. Movladi Udugov, a Chechen spokesman, said battles were raging at Shali after the rebels launched an attempt to recapture it. He claimed the town of Argun and the village of Mersky-Yurt a few miles east of Grozny had also been recaptured by the Chechens. Through the past two weeks of Russia's ground assault on Grozny, the Russians have been seeking to pin the guerrilla fighters down and pen them in the city centre. The weekend developments suggested this had failed and that Chechen forces were breaking out of the city to launch counter-attacks. The last few days have also seen the rebels stage ambushes and counter-attacks behind the Russian lines at Gudermes, Chechnya's second biggest city, and at Chervlennaya north of the capital. The Russians said they were using the suspension of the air and artillery assault on Grozny to regroup under new commanders. The Russians said they had surrounded the southern mountain town of Vedeno, a rebel stronghold, and that officers were seeking to negotiate the town's surrender. Moscow media speculated that the Russians might be preparing an even bigger assault on the battered capital where some 20,000 civilians, many of them elderly Russians, are at their wits' end after four months of bombardment. Some Russian media which have hitherto supported the war and the hawkish line of the acting president, Vladimir Putin, are beginning to undermine official confidence by highlighting the funerals of dead soldiers, and interviewing combatants who make two points unwelcome to the government and military leadership: that the war will not be over quickly and that the Russian casualties are inexorably mounting. Anatoly Kulikov, a former Russian interior minister who was one of the commanders in the 1994-96 war, predicted a long slog despite repeated official claims that the war will be over quickly. While the government continued to insist that the two generals commanding the eastern and western fronts were removed as a matter of routine \"rotation\" in order to give other officers the chance to show their mettle in battle, Mr Kulikov said: \"When you're talking of a decisive stage, you don't change the leadership.\"",

Amid renewed attacks on its running of the dome, the New Millennium Experience Company dismissed as \"utter nonsense\" reports that it will be forced to ask for taxpayers' money or to remain open for an extra eight months to attract enough visitors to break even. It is due to close at the end of December, although there is an option to remain open for an extra month if there is substantial public demand. But the company refused to rule out the option of seeking extra funding from the National Lottery if more cash is required during the year.

But the dome would reach its break-even figure of \u00a3184m revenue with 8.8m visitors, or 24,000 a day. Attendance figures are due to be released at the end of the month, but reports yesterday claimed that the numbers so far have averaged around 10,000 a day. If that remained the average for the year, the organisers would be left with a \u00a3113m hole in their finances. But Gez Sagar, the dome's spokesman, insisted the organisers were confident that the 12m target would be reached and there would be no financial shortfall. Both visitor numbers and income during the first week were well ahead of the business plan's forecasts, he said. \"We are first and foremost a tourist attraction and that means our attendance figures will follow the rest of the UK leisure industry, with January and February the slower months. But in the summer we expect to be getting up to 55,000 visitors a day.\"",

      "bodyText": "Police conducting the criminal investigation into the Paddington rail crash yesterday said there was virtually no chance of anyone ever standing trial in connection with the disaster. Officers say that the attorney general's decision to offer immunity to all evidence presented to a public inquiry means that rail company bosses - if suspected of corporate manslaughter - could be free from prosecution. The immunity undertaking is so wide that it means that there is almost certain to be no documents left that could be used to support a case. Louise Christian, a solicitor representing eight of the bereaved families, accused the government of taking a political decision to block prosecutions. She said there could be a legal challenge to narrow the scope of the immunity. British transport police launched an investigation after the crash which killed 31 people and injured 250 in October last year. Two trains crashed close to Paddington station in London after one ploughed through a partially obscured red danger signal. Officers were searching for evidence to bring a charge of manslaughter against the companies involved or individual employees. Such a case would rely heavily on internal documents from any company charged, but they would be covered by immunity if presented to the inquiry by the firm concerned. Within the last week officers have been in talks with the director of public prosecutions, David Calvert-Smith, over the impact of the immunity granted by Lord Williams, the attorney general. Railtrack and the two train companies, Great Western and Thames, face the possibility of charges. The Guardian has also learned that the health and safety executive is also under criminal investigation. Superintendent Tony Thompson of British transport police said: \"If certain key documents aren't admissible, it tears the heart out of any potential prosecution.\" He added: \"A lot of the stuff we will be relying on for a prosecution is going to be looked at by the inquiry. Once it's admitted and subject to immunity, there is virtually nothing left to base a case on.\" Lord Cullen, chairman of the public inquiry, asked for the immunity to help establish the full truth. To speed up his delivery of recommendations on rail safety, Lord Cullen's inquiry will start even if decisions over prosecutions have not been made, also raising the risk that a prosecution could founder because of prejudicial material emerging at the inquiry. Robin Kellow, who lost his daughter Elaine, 24, in the crash, said: \"It's an utter disgrace. People who do wrong should be punished.

Over the past decade, rich western countries have merrily trousered their peace dividends as a result of the end of the cold war, giving them the wherewithal to meet their United Nations targets for aid.

That means redistribution of power and redistribution of wealth. But above all it means a belief that we can do it. If we believe it can't be done, it won't be.",

The potential for a serious escalation is only too clear.</p> <p>Much the same might be said of the province of Aceh, in western Sumatra, the scene of much recent separatist violence. There seems little doubt that a majority of local people would vote for independence from Indonesia if their demand for a Timorese-style referendum were granted. So far, it has been refused. In Irian Jaya (known indigenously as Papua), in West Kalimantan, in South Sulawesi, and in Riau, in eastern Sumatra, a similar story is unfolding. While each agitation has its own particular aspects, this seemingly disparate unrest has some common causes. One is the political weakness, in the post-Suharto era, of the central government now led by President Abdurrahman Wahid and Megawati Sukarnoputri, his inexperienced deputy. Another is the economic depression that has plagued Indonesia for the past three years. Yet another is the widely-felt grievance that the natural resources of non-Javanese provinces are unfairly exploited by the Jakarta power elite.</p> <p>Is Indonesia about to break into pieces, to be Balkanised like a sort of Asian Yugoslavia? Its neighbours, who have most to lose in any such implosion, would be unwise to wait and see. Members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations, Japan, and China, many of whom ducked the Timor problem, leaving it largely to Australia and the west, should move quickly to bolster Mr Wahid. Humanitarian aid should be backed up by greater economic assistance. At this time of uncertain transition, escalating violence and resultant government repression help nobody.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The election of a new president last October and the ending of the crisis caused by East Timor's secession have brought little respite from political, ethnic and sectarian upheavals for the people of Indonesia. The latest flashpoint is centred on Ambon, the capital of the Moluccas in eastern Indonesia. An estimated 1,500 people have been killed in clashes between Muslim and Christian communities in more than a dozen islands in the past year, and perhaps 200,000 have been displaced. In contrast to East Timor, the army, which took over responsibility for security from the police last month, does not appear to be actively fuelling the conflict. But nor does it seem able to contain it. In faraway Jakarta, passions have become inflamed. Reckless calls are heard for a jihad (holy war) against the Christian minority. The potential for a serious escalation is only too clear. Much the same might be said of the province of Aceh, in western Sumatra, the scene of much recent separatist violence. There seems little doubt that a majority of local people would vote for independence from Indonesia if their demand for a Timorese-style referendum were granted. So far, it has been refused. In Irian Jaya (known indigenously as Papua), in West Kalimantan, in South Sulawesi, and in Riau, in eastern Sumatra, a similar story is unfolding. While each agitation has its own particular aspects, this seemingly disparate unrest has some common causes. One is the political weakness, in the post-Suharto era, of the central government now led by President Abdurrahman Wahid and Megawati Sukarnoputri, his inexperienced deputy. Another is the economic depression that has plagued Indonesia for the past three years. Yet another is the widely-felt grievance that the natural resources of non-Javanese provinces are unfairly exploited by the Jakarta power elite. Is Indonesia about to break into pieces, to be Balkanised like a sort of Asian Yugoslavia? Its neighbours, who have most to lose in any such implosion, would be unwise to wait and see. Members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations, Japan, and China, many of whom ducked the Timor problem, leaving it largely to Australia and the west, should move quickly to bolster Mr Wahid. Humanitarian aid should be backed up by greater economic assistance. At this time of uncertain transition, escalating violence and resultant government repression help nobody.",

      "bodyText": "Children in care are still suffering abuse at the hands of those who are supposedly looking after them despite efforts to clean up the system, the NSPCC says today. The child protection charity is warning against such abuse being seen as a thing of the past when the long-awaited Waterhouse report on scandals in north Wales children's homes is published shortly. But the charity's intervention has angered social services leaders, who accuse it of exaggerating problems in order to promote its own role at the expense of existing child protection arrangements. Jo Williams, president of the Association of Directors of Social Services, said the NSPCC was mixing the messages of the importance of protecting children with its aspirations to increase the number of its own investigation teams. The clash is a foretaste of the potentially acrimonious fallout from the Waterhouse report, which will deal mainly with abuse cases in the 1970s and 1980s. Ministers will respond in part to the report by citing the care standards bill, which seeks to tighten safeguards for children in care. But the NSPCC says the government needs to go further. The charity says abuse is still occurring and the care system needs to be opened to more independent scrutiny to ensure that children in both residential and foster placements get \"five star\" protection. In the 12 months to last October, NSPCC workers conducted 82 investigations into alleged physical and sexual abuse of children in the care of more than 60 local authorities. Forty-five of the investigations related to alleged events within the previous two years. The investigations as a whole involved more than 200 allegations against 138 individuals and, the charity says, have so far resulted in charges against 53 care workers and others in positions of trust. One abuser, already convicted and sent to prison for six years, subjected a young girl to sex assaults over a period of three years while he was her foster carer. Inquiries established that he had cared for 15 other children, two of whom also alleged abuse. The charity says that in recent years, it has investigated allegations of children in care as young as five being kicked, slapped, thrown against walls, forced to perform oral sex and made to pose for pornographic photography. Neil Hunt, the charity's child protection director, said: \"The number of children involved in these investigations represents a small minority of the 55,000 children in care. However, the NSPCC believes that one child abused in the care system is one too many.\" The charity is calling for all allegations of abuse in the care system to be referred for investigation by independent teams of specialist child protection officers, working with the police. At present, the NSPCC runs 11 such teams. As a result of its Full Stop campaign, which has been seeking to raise \u00a3250m towards a goal of ending child abuse, it intends to establish another five. The charity is also pressing for the creation of a children's commissioner, with stronger powers and a wider remit than the \"director of children's rights\" proposed in the care standards bill. All children in care should have a statutory right to independent advocacy services and access to a safe, adult friend trained as an independent visitor, the charity says. Ms Williams said five years of building added precautions and tightening checks was ensuring that abusers were being wrung out of the care system. The NSPCC carried out important work, but was involved in only a tiny minority of abuse investigations, she added. Most were conducted by social workers and the police, and the charity's idea of independent investigation \"could undermine\" such arrangements. One social services director went further, privately saying: \"Directors everywhere will be disappointed and in many cases resent the fact that the NSPCC should use its information at such a sensitive time to promote the services it wishes local authorities to buy.\" In a statement, the department of health said new guidance made it clear that investigations should involve an independent person.",

The couple, who can be named only as the Ws, are now divorced. Both suffer from depression and can no longer work. The children, three girls and a boy, have had to undergo extensive psychiatric counselling. In April 1993 the family accepted G, a boy aged 15, into their home. He was there for only a month, but he systematically physically and sexually abused all four children, then aged between seven and 12. What the Ws didn't know - though Essex county council, which placed him, did - was that G was a known abuser who had been cautioned and taken into care at age 12 for an indecent assault on his sister, seven. Tomorrow the parents will go to the House of Lords to try to overturn refusals by the high court and court of appeal to let them sue the council for compensation. After a five-year battle, the appeal court agreed last year that the children could claim damages, but not the parents. The council has fought the case strenuously, although it admits that the abuse took place and that it was aware of the teenager's background. When the family issued their writ, the council applied to the court for the claim to be struck out. It was relying on a House of Lords ruling in 1994 which confirmed that councils are normally immune from negligence actions over the way they carry out their statutory child care duties. The council argued in the high court that it would be immune even if it knowingly placed an adolescent convicted of rape or robbery with a family, and even if a social worker had deliberately lied to the parents. But the case was so extreme that Mr Justice Hooper refused to strike out the children's claim, making it the first such case to be allowed to go ahead in the courts. However, the parents' claim was struck out because the judge held that they were secondary, not primary, victims since they played no personal part in the events. The House of Lords has held in a number of cases, especially those brought by families of fans killed in the Hillsborough football ground disaster, that secondary victims can claim compensation only if they witnessed the traumatic event in person. The appeal court, by a two to one majority, agreed that the W children's claims could go ahead but not the parents'. Both sides appealed to the House of Lords, but the council has now dropped its appeal against the ruling in the children's favour. However, it is still strongly contesting the parents' claim. Allan Levy, the family's QC, will argue that the parents were primary victims who participated in the traumatic events as unknowing or unwitting agents in bringing the teenager into their home. Both parents were plunged into severe depression, blaming themselves for their children's trauma, and their marriage disintegrated. Lord Justice Judge, one of the appeal court judges who gave the go-ahead to the children's claims, said: \"For all the members of the family these were catastrophic events.\" The parents, who underwent an assessment and training course for caring for adolescents, claim they sought and were given assurances by the council that no teenager suspected of sexual abuse would be placed with them. The agreement they signed stated that foster parents would be fully informed about any problem relating to a foster child's background. They claim they were told only that the boy could be a bully and a liar and that his father, a convicted paedophile, had abused him. Had they known his history, they say, they would never have taken him into their home and endangered their children. Within a month they noticed that their four had become fearful and withdrawn. One day the teenager allegedly said casually that he had been accused of raping a girl in a children's home. The parents asked for him to be removed.

Under the picture the words just say The John McCain Story.</p> <p>And what a story it is. Grandfather and father both US admirals. A testosterone-charged, roustabout youth. Nearly fails to graduate from the US naval academy at Annapolis. Sent to Vietnam as a pilot. Shot down over Haiphong in 1967. Pulled from the sea, body broken, and interned in the prison the GIs called the Hanoi Hilton. Tortured. Beaten. Repeatedly offered a preferential early release, which he refuses. Spends five-and-a-half years as a prisoner of war.</p> <p>He returns, still on crutches, when a peace deal is signed. His marriage cannot stand the strain. He remarries, to Cindy Hensley. Stands for congress as a Republican. Succeeds Barry Goldwater in the senate. Now running for president. Ladies and gentlemen, the John McCain story.</p> <p>Contrast McCain's story with that of his principal Republican rival, George W Bush, another likeable man with an agreeably misspent youth. But there the resemblance ends. Where McCain's adulthood has been seared by death and war, Bush's has been gifted to him by privilege and his presidential dad. When McCain published his autobiography last year, he called it Faith of My Fathers. If Bush wrote a similar life story, one reviewer suggested, he would have to call it Friends of My Father's.</p> <p>As McCain campaigned last week in New Hampshire, where the polls show him ahead in that state's all important first-in-the-nation February 1 primary, people arrive at McCain's meeting in Franklin bearing copies of his book.</p> <p>\"I see some of you have my book,\" McCain says, as he begins to warm up the packed crowd. \"I wouldn't want to hype it. It costs $24.95; it's 16 weeks on the bestsellers; it's available from Amazon.com.\" McCain grins and the audience laughs at his cheek.</p> <p>If McCain was just a conservative military man with a brave war record running for office, he would be easy to pigeonhole. But it's not that simple. McCain appeals to conservatives and radicals alike, not just to the ageing veterans whose welfare he constantly champions but also to the young first-time voters who find the other candidates too boring and cautious to hold their attention.</p> <p>McCain is a Republican independent. For someone who has lived so much of his life under service discipline, his record is liberally littered with rebellion and insubordination. A prankster and hustler at the academy, he is now the most iconoclastic member of the 55-strong Republican majority in the US senate. On two issues in particular, tobacco and campaign finance reform, he has set himself apart from the Republican establishment. No candidate in this year's race has more powerful enemies within his own party than McCain.</p> <p>This audacity is delivered with a charm, humour and confidence which delights his supporters and infuriates his enemies. McCain's campaign hallmark is his informality and accessibility. In town hall meetings around New Hampshire, he chats and answers any question. His minders do not mind - that's his style, and the media and his supporters love it.</p> <p>\"I find that brief remarks are the most popular,\" he tells his audience in Franklin, cracking a few jokes before taking questions on a bewildering range of topics. It's hard to think of a politician who appears more at ease for so much of the time. Certainly not Bush, nor the two Democratic presidential hopefuls, Al Gore and Bill Bradley.</p> <p>They ask him about everything from pollution to Russia, from health to pornography, and most of the time he has something interesting to say. He is brilliant at excoriating the Clinton administration's foreign policy. \"A photo-op, poll-driven foreign policy,\" he often dubs it. Other times, he calls it \"foreign policy as social work\".</p> <p>Not surprisingly, he is hot on military issues. Though he supported Clinton over Kosovo, he is scathing about the administration's tactics there. \"Planes dropping bombs from 15,000ft, killing innocent people. There's something fundamentally immoral about that.\"</p> <p>During the Kosovo crisis, he says, the US moved an aircraft carrier from the Pacific to that theatre. \"That was the first time since 1945 that we didn't have an aircraft carrier in the Pacific. Suppose that North Korea had chosen that moment to do something.\"</p> <p>Foreign policy, though, won't win or lose him the race for the nomination. Taxes might. While Bush offers a massive tax-cutting programme of half a trillion dollars over five years - promising \"tax cuts, so help me God\" in last week's New Hampshire debate - McCain remains steadfastly in the mainstream with most Democrats, in favour of some tax cuts, but not for the rich, an astonishing piece of audacity for a Republican.</p> <p>\"I believe that rather than spending the surplus on tax cuts we have to make sure that social security is solvent,\" he tells the Franklin audience. \"To use it all in tax cuts is a risky business. I know it sounds populist, but I'm not sure that millionaires and billionaires need a tax cut.\"</p> <p>He stands on a small platform in the middle of the hall holding a microphone. He never explicitly exploits his suffering, but everyone in the hall knows he cannot raise his arms above the shoulder because of his wounds, left untreated and neglected in Hanoi. Whenever a veteran speaks, McCain is visibly moved. Tears glisten more than once.</p> <p>Behind him is a banner that says Restoring Respect - McCain. He travels in a bus that he calls the Straight Talk Express. His television ads say The Character To Do Things Right. Though he has a legendary temper, he is unfailingly courteous on the stump. When anyone tells him about their own military experience - and lots of older voters do, often showing him photographs of themselves in their uniformed days - he always says \"Thank you for serving\".</p> <p>\"Look at that man,\" says an awestruck staffer. \"This guy is not stressed. He's having such a good time.\" More seasoned heads have been turned by McCain too. Bill Bennett, Ronald Reagan's education secretary and former \"drugs tsar\", told me in New Hampshire: \"He brings back to the Oval Office what people have been missing. When he comes on TV, instead of people changing the channel they'll turn up the volume.\"</p> <p>McCain's openness to the press is counter-cultural in these times of limited access, over-anxious staffers, and ubiquitous security details. On the ride back from Franklin, 10 of us sit around in the back of the bus shooting the breeze with the candidate, while he talks at length about the campaign and the world.</p> <p>He tells us that he is confident about his opposition to massive tax cuts. \"People don't press for them. That tells me that they want to pay down the debt, to protect social security. Most people are doing well. They feel a responsibility to those who might not be.\"</p> <p>All this has inevitably bred doubts in parts of the media. \"It is a cliche in journalism circles these days to grouse that the media, in their coverage of McCain, are acting like schoolgirls at a Ricky Martin concert,\" wrote Eron Shosteck in the prestigious National Journal last week.</p> <p>\"But the near-unanimity with which the media seem to have fallen in love with McCain is unprecedented in modern presidential politics.</p> <p>\"His strategy of giving the media unlimited access has to be having an effect on his coverage. Indeed, some have even speculated that, in return for being so open, McCain has benefited from smitten reporters who have not reported potentially damaging comments an unguarded McCain has made in interviews.\"</p> <p>For there is another McCain that the world rarely sees. The Arizona Republic has repeatedly claimed that \"it is time the rest of the nation learned about the John McCain we know in Arizona\", and said there was \"reason to seriously question whether he has the temperament, and the political approach and skills, we want in the next president\".</p> <p>Two years ago, the Phoenix New Times went even further, calling McCain \"a mean-spirited, hot-tempered, opportunistic, philandering, hypocritical political climber who married a comely beer heiress and used her daddy's money to get elected to congress in a state he can hardly call home\".</p> <p>Last week, as if on cue, the McCain campaign hit a potentially serious glitch. The Boston Globe reported that McCain had used his position on a senate committee to press the federal communications commission to expedite its approval of a television station purchase by Paxson Communications, owned by a McCain supporter, Lowell Paxson. McCain has made four campaign trips in Paxson's private jet in recent months.</p> <p>McCain tried to brush the allegation off, but last Thursday's debate with Bush, held at the University of New Hampshire, hung on how McCain handled the issue under the television lights. Wasn't this hypocrisy, or at least poor judgment, the debate moderator asked McCain. His response was, by his standards, wary and long-winded, betraying an uncharacteristic anxiety not to say anything either glib or off-message.</p> <p>Rather than drive home his advantage, Bush said he was more concerned by McCain's preoccupation with campaign finance reform than this issue, but it had still been a difficult day for a man who presents himself as Mr Clean. \"If you're explaining you're losing,\" said Bush's media strategist after the debate.</p> <p>In a bar afterwards, McCain reviews his performance with supporters. He cracks jokes, pumps up his team. \"There's only 26 days, four hours and six minutes before the polls open,\" McCain tells them. \"We'll be entertaining and informative and we'll be able to take the positions that we believe in. Let me just give you an example. Cindy has asked me to give a 45-minute speech on the North Korean nuclear build-up.\" The campaign workers collapse in laughter and applause, as they always do.</p> <p>Can McCain win? It's definitely an outside bet. He is ahead in New Hampshire, one of those states where independents, who love McCain, can vote in the primary.</p> <p>Bush's cash juggernaut and superior organisation give him the advantage almost everywhere else. If McCain wins New Hampshire, though, he'll be on a roll that could change everything. Yet the party establishment, lined up behind Bush, is prepared in states where McCain has hardly campaigned yet.</p> <p>The toughest fight for McCain is the one for the nomination. If he wins at the Republican convention in July, his broad appeal could make him a very plausible candidate against the Democrats in November.</p> <p>President McCain? A First Lady called Cindy?

The National Trust has announced a range of working holidays to raise awareness of Britain's threatened environments and offer an alternative to \"boring\" beach holidays. Launching the trust's working holidays programme, David Bellamy, the botanist and TV presenter, said the holidays offered an unparalleled opportunity to learn more about the environment. \"Not only will you learn the age-old skills of landscape management, but you will be in the company of local experts who will open your eyes to the living wonders of our coastline,\" he said. \"If you are tempted to say 'I am too old, or not fit enough', I can assure you that there is a whole range of important jobs to be done. I can also guarantee that you will be fitter at the end of your working holiday, whether it's beside the seaside or in deep countryside.\" Among the holidays on offer is a week at Formby, Merseyside, where wardens will instruct volunteers how to develop habitats for the natterjack toad and a tiny population of red squirrels that persists along this stretch of the west coast. At Lacock abbey in Wiltshire there will be a chance to join in an archaeological excavation of a lost garden, while in April at Dolaucothi, Carmarthenshire, volunteers can spend their Easter break improving footpaths and access to goldmines above the Cothi valley. Other schemes include replanting the formal gardens at Waddesdon manor, Buckinghamshire, goat-herding on the Isle of Wight, beachcombing at Chyvarloe in Cornwall, and, for those of an excitable disposition, counting sheep on Lundy Island (selected dates between March and September). Finally, in a scheme that may reveal more about the economic realities facing the National Trust than the environment it works to protect, volunteers can work unpaid as stewards at a concert by the Queen tribute band Magic at Bodiam castle in Kent.",

The composer of such mega musical hits as Evita, Jesus Christ Superstar, Cats and Phantom of the Opera - which has taken twice as much in box office receipts worldwide as Titanic - has bought London's biggest theatre empire for \u00a387.5m. Lloyd-Webber quickly denied he was buying up the West End so he could fill it with his own work. \"My God, I hope I'm not,\" he joked. His spokesman, Daniel Bee, said not even a composer of Lloyd-Webber's prolific and \"prodigious talents\" could possibly fill 13 theatres at once. The deal for Stoll Moss - which owns such renowned West End theatres as the London Palladium, the Garrick and the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane - was finally sealed yesterday following a long drawn-out auction over the new year. It makes Lord Lloyd Webber - who famously threatened to quit the country if Labour won the last election - the undisputed king of theatreland and one of the world's most powerful impresarios. It also sees off the looming American threat to the West End after the Apollo Group and its 23, mostly regional, theatres and arenas were swallowed up last year by the US entertainment giant SFX for \u00a3157m. With the box offices booming, and London property prices soaring, SFX had been eyeing some of Stoll Moss's 10 large West End houses - though monopoly laws would probably have prevented their buying them all up. Even so, with their subsidiary, the Ambassadors Group, bidding for the eight-strong chain of smaller Crescent theatres, there had been fears that US domination would at best water down the West End's unique diversity of drama, and at worst turn it into the kind of theatrical theme park that many claim New York's Broadway has become since the advent of Disney's Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King. Lloyd-Webber said he was worried that, if he did not act, London's theatres would fall into the hands of conglomerates \"who wouldn't necessarily understand [that] the thing about the theatre is you have got to take risks\". His spokesman said the composer did not step in purely out of the goodness of his heart. \"It has to be very good news for London, with so many theatres being snapped up by the Americans. It's very important such historic names stay in British ownership,\" Mr Bee said. \"There is no danger whatsoever of just putting on musicals.

Stoll Moss's chief executive, Richard Johnson, will stay on, and widespread redundancies are not expected.

Genuinely unsure whether it would be better to be recognised or not recognised - because celebrities fear privacy although they claim to crave it - she is finally approached by an evangelist who has had a dream revealing that the Spice Girls need Jesus in their life. Meanwhile, a burly minder hovers nervously nearby. </p> <p>In a few scenes like these - which genuinely give viewers that rare view from inside the smoked-glass limo windows - a really bad idea for a programme becomes a compelling one. There is an electrifying sequence in which Posh goes shopping in a Virgin Megastore with Elton John. Grabbing CDs in triplicate - one for the South of France, one for Atlanta, one for here - he contributes the only decent interview of the film, although it is conducted in reverse. </p> <p>What do you think of Geri's album?, he wonders. Um, replies Posh. How do you get on with the manager of Manchester United?, he follows up. Not having seen the rest of the programme, Elton can't know that he is giving her a cruel lesson in how to be a celebrity interviewer but the dismissal of her prospects is as final as a footballer's sending off. </p> <p>In the programme's final interview, Posh attempts to interrogate her husband in a dressing room. He is stubbornly wearing a bandana indoors, exposing again the paradox that a man who is clearly so thin-skinned should offer so many provocations to mocking.

Because of lust and love and gaucheness, Posh is unable to ask any questions. </p> <p>This serious weakness in a would-be interviewer should logically be the end of television's flirtation with celebrity presenters. London viewers might also make a note to avoid the return of Edward Windsor with Crown And Country (Tuesday, 10.30pm, Thames). But a failed chat-show becomes another fascinating film about fame.

      "body": "<p>The Philhelline, editor and writer, Marion Sarafis, who has died aged 86, was the widow of the Greek Popular Liberation Army (ELAS) second world war commander, General Stefanos Sarafis.</p> <p>She was the only child of an Anglo-Austrian family, born in its substantial family house, Bracken Hill, in Woking. It remained her lifelong haven. She was educated at home and convent school, and read classics at Oxford university.</p> <p>Following a Cambridge postgraduate archaeology course, she travelled to Athens in 1936, and joined the British School of Archaeology. From 1937-39, she worked and wrote on excavations at Lasithi in Crete, uncovering two statues now in the Heraklion museum.</p> <p>While researching in Milos, she met Sarafis, a leading leftist republican in internal exile for his part in the 1935 coup, which opposed the monarchical restoration. A romantic attachment slowly developed during walks on the island's hills within sight of the supervising gendarme in the caf\u00e9 below. But their friendship was broken off by the second world war.</p> <p>In 1939, she offered her services to the British embassy in Athens, but was turned down, she believed, because of her friendship with Sarafis. Back in England she worked tirelessly for Greek relief efforts. During the civil war which followed the German defeat, she was a founder member of the League for Democracy in Greece, which campaigned for the release of imprisoned resistance fighters and for those, like Sarafis, in internal exile. It also lobbied for human rights in Greece.</p> <p>In 1951, she edited an English edition of his book, Greek Resistance Army: The Story of ELAS. Work on the text meant correspondence throughout the late 40s and their affection grew. Back in Greece, a mutual friend told her that \"the general\", as she called him, reciprocated her love, but given his reticence would never articulate it. Marion proposed. They married in 1952.</p> <p>Five intensely happy years followed in the Athenian seaside suburb of Alimos. Self-effacingly, she supported his campaigning for the United Democratic Left party. Then, in 1957, they were hit by a vehicle driven by an American serviceman.

      "bodyText": "The Philhelline, editor and writer, Marion Sarafis, who has died aged 86, was the widow of the Greek Popular Liberation Army (ELAS) second world war commander, General Stefanos Sarafis. She was the only child of an Anglo-Austrian family, born in its substantial family house, Bracken Hill, in Woking. It remained her lifelong haven. She was educated at home and convent school, and read classics at Oxford university. Following a Cambridge postgraduate archaeology course, she travelled to Athens in 1936, and joined the British School of Archaeology. From 1937-39, she worked and wrote on excavations at Lasithi in Crete, uncovering two statues now in the Heraklion museum. While researching in Milos, she met Sarafis, a leading leftist republican in internal exile for his part in the 1935 coup, which opposed the monarchical restoration. A romantic attachment slowly developed during walks on the island's hills within sight of the supervising gendarme in the caf\u00e9 below. But their friendship was broken off by the second world war. In 1939, she offered her services to the British embassy in Athens, but was turned down, she believed, because of her friendship with Sarafis. Back in England she worked tirelessly for Greek relief efforts. During the civil war which followed the German defeat, she was a founder member of the League for Democracy in Greece, which campaigned for the release of imprisoned resistance fighters and for those, like Sarafis, in internal exile. It also lobbied for human rights in Greece. In 1951, she edited an English edition of his book, Greek Resistance Army: The Story of ELAS. Work on the text meant correspondence throughout the late 40s and their affection grew. Back in Greece, a mutual friend told her that \"the general\", as she called him, reciprocated her love, but given his reticence would never articulate it. Marion proposed. They married in 1952. Five intensely happy years followed in the Athenian seaside suburb of Alimos. Self-effacingly, she supported his campaigning for the United Democratic Left party. Then, in 1957, they were hit by a vehicle driven by an American serviceman. The general was killed and Marion's right leg was shattered and ineptly set; it bowed outwards, leaving her with what she referred to as \"hammer and sickle legs\". She returned to England, where she devoted much of her time to keeping up Bracken Hill, pursuing interests, from reading English, French, German, Modern Greek and Latin to music, theatre and gallery going. She maintained her interest in Greece, retained her Greek citizenship and was an active campaigner during the 1967-74 colonels' dictatorship.

      "body": "<p>Dennis Severs, who has died aged 51, tried to bring the past alive in the dark and strange living house museum he created inside 18 Folgate Street, Spitalfields, on the edge of London's East End.</p> <p>It became, as he described it, \"a famous time-machine\" in which those prepared to enter his empathetic historical imagination and to suspend disbelief (never mind mundane considerations of historical fact, conventional museum practice or conservation philosophy) could find themselves transported into a dream which illuminated the complicated and poignant social history of that ancient part of London.</p> <p>Although sneered at by many who suffer from what he would have dismissed as \"pigeonholed styles of intelligence\" inhibiting creativity, Severs was a true original, an artist of perverse genius who created a three-dimensional historical novel out of bricks and mortar and timber and the objects he picked up for a song on countless stalls.</p> <p>The social historian Raphael Samuel considered it \"a magical mystery tour which dazzles the visitor with a succession of scenes more crowded with memorable incident than the mere facsimile of what passes in the museums as a period room\".</p> <p>Dennis was one of those Americans in England who seemed to have arrived from nowhere, to have no past, no roots and who, so irritatingly, could not be placed socially. I first encountered him in the late 60s as the exotic friend of a Cambridge friend; he was then running horse-drawn open carriage tours around Hyde Park and the West End (\"See Something Different Graciously\") and seemed, even for me then, a little too starry-eyed about the charm of Victorian England. But Dennis was not a blazer and Brooks Brothers stereotype American Anglophile; he was humorous, generous, passionate, altogether unpretentious and engagingly camp.</p> <p>I now know that he was a Californian, the son of Earl and Helen Severs, then of Escondito, who already had four sons between them by different marriages. In an unpublished guide to his house entitled The Space Between, Severs recalled that, as a dreamy and imaginative child, he was regarded at one of his several schools as somewhere between \"exceptional\" and \"mentally retarded.\"</p> <p>Storytelling earned him the respect of his peers, while the mania to collect began early. \"Down deep,\" he recalled, \"I always believed that one day I would travel past picture frames and into the marinated glow of a warmer, more mellow and more romantic light. There was one such light in particular, one that I saw in the combination of old varnish and paint, and that appealed to me as my ideal. By the age of 11, it was identified as English.\"</p> <p>Severs visited England in 1965 and moved to London two years later, after high school graduation. He abandoned plans to become a barrister in favour of carriage tours, but then his stable, near Gloucester Road, was demolished by a developer. He bought the brick George I terraced house, to which he devoted the rest of his life, in 1979.</p> <p>It was the right time: the campaign to restore Hawksmoor's great church nearby had begun, while the Spitalfields Historic Buildings Trust was fighting to prevent the erosion of that run-down, but mysterious, inner suburb. The artists Gilbert and George had already moved into Fournier Street while, more significantly perhaps, another pioneering resident was the late Raphael Samuel, whose analysis of the contemporary phenomenon of \"retrochic\" in his book, Theatres of Memory, celebrated that restorative sympathy for the artefacts of the past that so moved Dennis.</p> <p>As he put it, he did not want so much to \"restore\" the house with its panelled rooms, \"but to bring it to life as my home. With a candle, a chamber pot and a bedroll, I began sleeping in each of the house's 10 rooms so that I might arouse my intuition in the quest for each room's soul.</p> <p>\"Then, having neared it, I worked inside out from there to create what turned out to be a collection of atmospheres: moods that harbour the light and the spirit of various ages in Time.\"</p> <p>The Spitalfields inhabited by Dennis was that of the novelist Peter Ackroyd rather than that of the historian John Summerson.

      "bodyText": "Dennis Severs, who has died aged 51, tried to bring the past alive in the dark and strange living house museum he created inside 18 Folgate Street, Spitalfields, on the edge of London's East End. It became, as he described it, \"a famous time-machine\" in which those prepared to enter his empathetic historical imagination and to suspend disbelief (never mind mundane considerations of historical fact, conventional museum practice or conservation philosophy) could find themselves transported into a dream which illuminated the complicated and poignant social history of that ancient part of London. Although sneered at by many who suffer from what he would have dismissed as \"pigeonholed styles of intelligence\" inhibiting creativity, Severs was a true original, an artist of perverse genius who created a three-dimensional historical novel out of bricks and mortar and timber and the objects he picked up for a song on countless stalls. The social historian Raphael Samuel considered it \"a magical mystery tour which dazzles the visitor with a succession of scenes more crowded with memorable incident than the mere facsimile of what passes in the museums as a period room\". Dennis was one of those Americans in England who seemed to have arrived from nowhere, to have no past, no roots and who, so irritatingly, could not be placed socially. I first encountered him in the late 60s as the exotic friend of a Cambridge friend; he was then running horse-drawn open carriage tours around Hyde Park and the West End (\"See Something Different Graciously\") and seemed, even for me then, a little too starry-eyed about the charm of Victorian England. But Dennis was not a blazer and Brooks Brothers stereotype American Anglophile; he was humorous, generous, passionate, altogether unpretentious and engagingly camp. I now know that he was a Californian, the son of Earl and Helen Severs, then of Escondito, who already had four sons between them by different marriages. In an unpublished guide to his house entitled The Space Between, Severs recalled that, as a dreamy and imaginative child, he was regarded at one of his several schools as somewhere between \"exceptional\" and \"mentally retarded.\" Storytelling earned him the respect of his peers, while the mania to collect began early. \"Down deep,\" he recalled, \"I always believed that one day I would travel past picture frames and into the marinated glow of a warmer, more mellow and more romantic light. There was one such light in particular, one that I saw in the combination of old varnish and paint, and that appealed to me as my ideal. By the age of 11, it was identified as English.\" Severs visited England in 1965 and moved to London two years later, after high school graduation. He abandoned plans to become a barrister in favour of carriage tours, but then his stable, near Gloucester Road, was demolished by a developer. He bought the brick George I terraced house, to which he devoted the rest of his life, in 1979. It was the right time: the campaign to restore Hawksmoor's great church nearby had begun, while the Spitalfields Historic Buildings Trust was fighting to prevent the erosion of that run-down, but mysterious, inner suburb. The artists Gilbert and George had already moved into Fournier Street while, more significantly perhaps, another pioneering resident was the late Raphael Samuel, whose analysis of the contemporary phenomenon of \"retrochic\" in his book, Theatres of Memory, celebrated that restorative sympathy for the artefacts of the past that so moved Dennis. As he put it, he did not want so much to \"restore\" the house with its panelled rooms, \"but to bring it to life as my home. With a candle, a chamber pot and a bedroll, I began sleeping in each of the house's 10 rooms so that I might arouse my intuition in the quest for each room's soul. \"Then, having neared it, I worked inside out from there to create what turned out to be a collection of atmospheres: moods that harbour the light and the spirit of various ages in Time.\" The Spitalfields inhabited by Dennis was that of the novelist Peter Ackroyd rather than that of the historian John Summerson. And to illuminate these atmospheres for his paying visitors, Severs invented a family called Jervis who had lived there over the centuries and whose members had apparently just left each of the rooms entered. With that openness and lack of prejudice which is America at its best, he cleverly combined low and high tech: real guttering candles co-existed with concealed taped sound-effects in settings which he constantly refined. Nor was this frivolous or cynical: visitors who giggled or who were otherwise unable to enter into the spirit of the enterprise would be summarily ejected. Nothing could be less New Labour than Severs's achievement; for him, emotionally understanding the past was vital and his vision was holistic and therapeutic, almost spiritual. He felt able to summon up past eras not through history books, but through empathy with objects and places, to tell a fictional, true story \"aimed at those who want to make sense of the whole picture of being alive\". Shortly before he died two days after Christmas, ravaged by cancer, bravely borne, after long being HIV-positive, his house was bought by the Spitalfields Trust, but it is hard to see how his creation can be sustained. \"Sadly,\" Dennis wrote, \"I have recently come to accept what I refused to accept for so long: that the house is only ephemeral. That no one can put a preservation order on atmosphere.\" Certainly not now Dennis Severs has gone to join the Jervises. \u0095 Dennis Severs, museum creator, born November 16 1948; died December 27 1999",

Little did the young musician realise that he would one day swap cold Russian winters for the humid swelter of the Brazilian rainforest - and that he would do so for the sake of his orchestral career. In October last year, the 25-year-old cellist left the renowned Kirov Opera to join the new Amazon Philharmonic, based in Manaus. He is not the only good east European musician now living in the jungle. Since the orchestra was founded two years ago it has become the focus of perhaps the most bizarre migration in the classical music world. At the last count the 54-member orchestra included 16 Bulgarians, 15 Belarussians and seven Russians. At least a dozen more east Europeans are expected to join this year. \"There's a very good outlook for me here,\" says Mr Bogatyrev, whose pale features are sunburned and sweaty. \"In Russia there is a war with Chechnya; I may be called up.

Mrs Thatcher is in South Africa to see her son, Mark. Mr Mandela once said \"let bygones be bygones\" when asked about the former prime minister's description of the ANC as terrorists. An official in the president's office, Tasneem Carrim, said Mr Mbeki is not quite as forgiving. \"I don't think the president would say 'let bygones be bygones'. But Mrs Thatcher is not prime minister anymore, and I don't think the president sees much harm in meeting with her.\"",

Unlike the others, though, Thomas does so knowing it is only a few hours until $86.06 worth of chemicals are injected into his veins to stop his heart.</p> <p>\"I've seen the [prison] officers eating fried chicken,\" he said yesterday, dressed in regulation orange jumpsuit and sitting 20ft from the execution chamber in Greenville prison, Virginia. \"I acquired a taste for the smell of it.\"</p> <p>Thomas was 17, still at school and too young to vote when he was convicted of murdering his girlfriend's mother and father because they wanted to keep the couple apart. Had he been born in almost any other country in the world he would not be facing death at 9pm (Eastern Time) near the heart of the Old South.</p> <p>\"I can't blame the United States; I can't blame Virginia,\" said Thomas. \"In a sense, I put myself here. It was a childish decision. I was a child. I'm not a victim of my environment, I'm not a victim of drugs. In the US we live under a democracy with freedom of speech, freedom of choice. Unfortunately, I made a bad choice.\"</p> <p>He is by no means the only one to have done so. About 70 death row inmates have been sentenced as juveniles in the US in the past 24 years and on Thursday Steve Roach is due to be executed in Virginia for murdering a neighbour when he too was 17. In Texas two more are soon to die.</p> <p>\"This would mark the first time since the death penalty was reinstated [in 1976] that so many juvenile offenders would be executed in so short a period,\" William Paul, president of the American Bar Association, wrote to Virginia's governor, Jim Gilmore. \"In our view, the execution of people for crimes they committed while children is unacceptable in a civilised society.\"</p> <p>Only Iran, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Yemen appeared with the US on a list of countries that have executed juvenile offenders in the past 10 years.</p> <p>Thirty-eight of the 50 states have the death penalty. It can be imposed at the age of 16 in 18 states, including Virginia; at 17 in five states, including Texas; and at 18 in 15 more.</p> <p><b> Spoiled child</b></p> <p>Mr Gilmore is the only person left who can prevent Thomas from dying tonight, by granting clemency. There is no reason to suppose that he will.</p> <p>\"I think Monday will be a glorious day, whatever way it goes,\" said Thomas, now 26. \"If it's commuted, I get some sort of life back. If it's not commuted, then I move on to another life. I believe death is only the beginning.\"</p> <p>He was raised by his grandparents in Chesterfield, about 100 miles from Richmond, the state capitol, where his mother Margaret lived, and he had no contact with his father until last summer.</p> <p>\"It was a pretty great childhood,\" said Thomas, allowing himself to laugh at how he believes his case confounds the stereotype of the criminal shaped by his miserable early years. \"I was a spoilt kid. Anything I wanted, they gave me: toys, motorcycles, all the normal kid things.\"</p> <p>He did pretty well at school and played baseball, basketball and soccer. But his grandparents died when he was 12 and he had to go to Richmond to live with his mother. \"I was moving in with someone I knew was my mother but I didn't know her as a person. I was moving from my home town.\"</p> <p>There were other changes: at 14, he was caught stealing music tapes from a shop; at 15, it was breaking and entering, possessing drugs, and then alcohol and trespass, which earned him three months in a special school for boys; at 16, he stole a car and spent four days in jail.</p> <p>\"Nothing violent - I never exhibited any violence to anyone.\" Not, at any rate, until he was 17 and back home, as he thinks of it, in Chesterfield. There he took up with 14-year-old Jessica Wiseman, whose parents disapproved of the relationship. The teenagers plotted to kill Kathy and James Wiseman, both 33, and they saw it through with a shotgun.</p> <p>Jessica was tried and convicted as a juvenile, held in a correctional centre until she was 21 and released three years ago. Thomas was charged as a juvenile, tried as an adult and sentenced to death.</p> <p><b> Search for identity</b></p> <p>\"She pulled the trigger,\" he said yesterday. \"I should have said it during my trial. I told her I would take full responsibility.\" Two women came forward last summer to say they had heard Jessica say she killed her mother.</p> <p>\"I don't hold any animosity towards her,\" said Thomas. \"At 17 I was impulsive. I was gullible, I was still searching for my identity, I was being who everyone wanted me to be. Now I've grown up. I've changed.\"</p> <p>He has spent his years in jail reading, watching television, working out, listening to music from opera to rap, anything that would take his mind off where he was. \"I like Frederick Forsyth. I read Andrew Morton's book about Princess Diana, but I'm a sceptical about Morton. She took her celebrity and made a difference.\"</p> <p>Not much can make a difference now for Chris Thomas, though he has been here before, last June, when a stay of execution was granted five hours before he was due to die. He had fried chicken for dinner that night, too.</p> <p><b>600 executed</b></p> <p>Since 1976, when the US supreme court reinstated the death penalty, 600 people have been put to death. There are 3,600 on death row.</p> <p>Two died this year: Malcolm Johnson by lethal injection in Oklahoma and David Duren by electrocution in Alabama.</p> <p>Texas has been responsible for 199 of those executed since 1976. Virginia has put to death 73 people, Florida 44 and Missouri 41. Colorado, Idaho, Ohio and Wyoming have executed one each.</p>",

Unlike the others, though, Thomas does so knowing it is only a few hours until $86.06 worth of chemicals are injected into his veins to stop his heart. \"I've seen the [prison] officers eating fried chicken,\" he said yesterday, dressed in regulation orange jumpsuit and sitting 20ft from the execution chamber in Greenville prison, Virginia. \"I acquired a taste for the smell of it.\" Thomas was 17, still at school and too young to vote when he was convicted of murdering his girlfriend's mother and father because they wanted to keep the couple apart. Had he been born in almost any other country in the world he would not be facing death at 9pm (Eastern Time) near the heart of the Old South. \"I can't blame the United States; I can't blame Virginia,\" said Thomas. \"In a sense, I put myself here. It was a childish decision. I was a child. I'm not a victim of my environment, I'm not a victim of drugs. In the US we live under a democracy with freedom of speech, freedom of choice. Unfortunately, I made a bad choice.\" He is by no means the only one to have done so. About 70 death row inmates have been sentenced as juveniles in the US in the past 24 years and on Thursday Steve Roach is due to be executed in Virginia for murdering a neighbour when he too was 17. In Texas two more are soon to die. \"This would mark the first time since the death penalty was reinstated [in 1976] that so many juvenile offenders would be executed in so short a period,\" William Paul, president of the American Bar Association, wrote to Virginia's governor, Jim Gilmore. \"In our view, the execution of people for crimes they committed while children is unacceptable in a civilised society.\" Only Iran, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Yemen appeared with the US on a list of countries that have executed juvenile offenders in the past 10 years. Thirty-eight of the 50 states have the death penalty. It can be imposed at the age of 16 in 18 states, including Virginia; at 17 in five states, including Texas; and at 18 in 15 more. Spoiled child Mr Gilmore is the only person left who can prevent Thomas from dying tonight, by granting clemency. There is no reason to suppose that he will. \"I think Monday will be a glorious day, whatever way it goes,\" said Thomas, now 26. \"If it's commuted, I get some sort of life back. If it's not commuted, then I move on to another life. I believe death is only the beginning.\" He was raised by his grandparents in Chesterfield, about 100 miles from Richmond, the state capitol, where his mother Margaret lived, and he had no contact with his father until last summer. \"It was a pretty great childhood,\" said Thomas, allowing himself to laugh at how he believes his case confounds the stereotype of the criminal shaped by his miserable early years. \"I was a spoilt kid. Anything I wanted, they gave me: toys, motorcycles, all the normal kid things.\" He did pretty well at school and played baseball, basketball and soccer. But his grandparents died when he was 12 and he had to go to Richmond to live with his mother. \"I was moving in with someone I knew was my mother but I didn't know her as a person. I was moving from my home town.\" There were other changes: at 14, he was caught stealing music tapes from a shop; at 15, it was breaking and entering, possessing drugs, and then alcohol and trespass, which earned him three months in a special school for boys; at 16, he stole a car and spent four days in jail. \"Nothing violent - I never exhibited any violence to anyone.\" Not, at any rate, until he was 17 and back home, as he thinks of it, in Chesterfield. There he took up with 14-year-old Jessica Wiseman, whose parents disapproved of the relationship. The teenagers plotted to kill Kathy and James Wiseman, both 33, and they saw it through with a shotgun. Jessica was tried and convicted as a juvenile, held in a correctional centre until she was 21 and released three years ago. Thomas was charged as a juvenile, tried as an adult and sentenced to death. Search for identity \"She pulled the trigger,\" he said yesterday. \"I should have said it during my trial. I told her I would take full responsibility.\" Two women came forward last summer to say they had heard Jessica say she killed her mother. \"I don't hold any animosity towards her,\" said Thomas. \"At 17 I was impulsive. I was gullible, I was still searching for my identity, I was being who everyone wanted me to be. Now I've grown up. I've changed.\" He has spent his years in jail reading, watching television, working out, listening to music from opera to rap, anything that would take his mind off where he was. \"I like Frederick Forsyth. I read Andrew Morton's book about Princess Diana, but I'm a sceptical about Morton. She took her celebrity and made a difference.\" Not much can make a difference now for Chris Thomas, though he has been here before, last June, when a stay of execution was granted five hours before he was due to die. He had fried chicken for dinner that night, too. 600 executed Since 1976, when the US supreme court reinstated the death penalty, 600 people have been put to death. There are 3,600 on death row. Two died this year: Malcolm Johnson by lethal injection in Oklahoma and David Duren by electrocution in Alabama. Texas has been responsible for 199 of those executed since 1976. Virginia has put to death 73 people, Florida 44 and Missouri 41. Colorado, Idaho, Ohio and Wyoming have executed one each.",

It was \"a physical experience, a bit painful\". They felt \"the rust, the dust\". It was, despite the multi-million-dollar equipment, 100%\"organic\".</p> <p>He has a new album out this month, Metamorphoses, \"a blank page, a new chapter\", in which for the first time in his career he has fully \"experimented\" with the voice, his own and others, using it naturally \"as an instrument\", the words as \"audio-pictograms\". It has an Oriental feel this album (it is also \"organic\"), and Jarre believes more and more that the next metamorphoses of Europe, in which \"we grow up enough to succeed as Europeans\", may come not from inside but from outside, from this Oriental connection, \"this glue\", we all share: \"The Turkish connection for Germans, the north African connection for France, Pakistani or Indian for Britain.\"</p> <p>He has a sensitive nature, he says. \"At the end of the day the saddest thing for me was clowns. I used to cry. The more the other children around me were laughing, the more I was crying.\"</p> <p>But Jarre is French after all. And handsome. And so charming. And so tiny. He sits in a recording studio in Paris, surrounded by crates (\"Pink Floyd World Tour\") and boys in Hard Rock cafe T-shirts, and all the wires and chrome and leads and cables and titanic speakers that attend his career as the man who brought the musical extravaganza, the techno tirade, to your local city centre (Paris, Beijing, Houston, Moscow... Docklands), like a Gallic Wizard of Oz.</p> <p>He looks like a spaniel, with his puppydog brown eyes and dark hair falling around his line-free face like two floppy ears, a lean Dudley Moore with his easy grin and shiny school boy trousers. His hands are pale and slim and a bit damp looking and always on the move, scratching his eyebrows, tweaking the flies of his trousers.</p> <p>\"Oh, you English women, you are so cheeky,\" he says. \"The guys in England are more cynical. It's funny, in France it is the reverse. English woman is more open and much less cynical, less knowing is the word, than the French woman. On my side I have this love affair with the UK...\"</p> <p>He has, however, separated from his wife, the English actress Charlotte Rampling; newspaper reports in 1997 said he'd left her for a 31-year-old French civil servant called Odile Froment. But he says he and Charlotte \"are like twins. Really, we are closer than ever. Really, she is the woman of my life.\" So you are living together again? \"Er, not really. We have separate lives but we will live together forever. Life is a long way...\"</p> <p>Jarre, who was born in Lyon, has been around almost as long as the Pyramids. He was experimenting at the Paris Conservatoire in 1966. Oxygene, his first international hit, was released in 1976, the same year he was voted Personality of the Year by People magazine. His first open air concert was on Bastille Day in Paris in 1979. (He fell into the whole outdoor scene by accident - in an attempt to make the performance of music based around a synthesiser interesting: \"the instruments were not so sexy,\" he says.)</p> <p>He's sold more than 50m albums along the way, but he found the 80s a bit lonely: \"I followed my way more or less by myself.\" But the raves of the 90s have caught him up. \"A lot of people joined the boat.\" He says he is a regular fixture on the rave scene. Does he take ecstasy when he's there?</p> <p>\"Er, no. But you know it is unfair to trap a movement with drugs. It is a never-ending story. Every movement has been linked with drugs, the beginning of jazz, the beginning of rock'n'roll, the beginning of heavy metal, punk, grunge, techno. Drug dealers have an impact when people are just starting a new way of expression, when they are fragile and vulnerable, but what is most interesting in the rave scene is the attempt to find an alternative to rock'n'roll.\"</p> <p>He could never have been a rock'n'roll star himself. He's adamant about that. He uses painting or writing analogies for what he does, not musical. It's a question of humility. \"I know that I'm a bit odd, or eccentric. But I never consider myself a pop star obsessed by my image. This image problem is a very 80s attitude, linked with a certain cynicism, that the image is more important than whoever you are. But mine is a more humble approach, to be part of a big picture, rather than going into a small theatre just with your guitar with a spotlight on yourself, thinking you are going to excite an audience for two hours.\"</p> <p>Jarre is not short of theories, and he's generous with them too. He has a complicated family - he and Rampling have a son; she had a son from a previous marriage, he had a daughter (he had custody of her from the time she was 18 months). They're all in their 20s now - a magician, a graphic designer, the movie business: a perfect division of the family talent - but he's happy to share his tips for domestic harmony. \"The 60s generated this silly attitude to leaving the kids to do whatever they want, which created a big mess.</p> <p>\"Charlotte and I always considered that you should give a framework where they could be as free as possible and then enlarge the framework as long as they are growing up. We are all very close, even among these mad crazy schedules. Yesterday I was with David. We had dinner at one in the morning until three. I had no other time and he was the same.\" As for he and Rampling: \"We will never divorce. The whole family is very close.\"</p> <p>There is one exception: his father, Maurice Jarre, who wrote the soundtrack to Dr Zhivago and lives in Los Angeles, \"trying... I mean continuing to do his work\". His son thinks he has met him about 20 times. \"As long as you can count the number of contacts with one member of your family, it is not a good thing. I am only now starting to cope with this. A blank space instead of a father is not a good thing. It means nothing. It's sad because apart from the personal things, it is quite unusual from a professional point of view when a French person is internationally successful in music, but to have two in the same family, it is crazy not to share that.\"</p> <p>His father has another son from a more recent relationship. \"I think it's even worse with this one than with me.\" Have you met him? \"No. Er, yes... I've met him, but, you know, I have enough responsibility with my own children. I'm not taking care of children from my father!\"</p> <p>For most of our encounter, Jarre fits easily into the role of the ageless celebrity, one of the most successful post-Beatles musicians. Everyone around him bangs on about how wonderful he looks for his age (\"Fit, 50 and not a firework in sight!\" begins his press pack). And he does. He was on \"a silly\" French version of This Is Your Life recently, and \"suddenly you are in front of your mates of when you were 14 and they were these old, established people. I had the feeling they belonged to the generation of my father.\"</p> <p>But, after talking for a while, he begins to act his age, giving a nice rant at the French tax system when I asked how rich he was (he and Rampling brought their children up in a 14-bedroom chateau at Versailles; he still lives nearby). \"I am not at all like these English pop stars who are not paying taxes by having these big tours and avoiding any traps with the tax,\" he said crossly. \"I am a victim of the highest tax in Europe.</p> <p>\"It's a joke in France. If you have so many people unemployed it's because people are living on this system, working to just the limit and getting paid in black [economy] money, while a small percentage of people are working day and night for really the rest of the country.\"</p> <p>He's gone off America: \"It's an old-new concept. It's a dated country.\" He's fed up with being associated with lasers. \"I don't like lasers. I think it's very disco. I'm not a fan.\" He's against cosmetic surgery. \"All these silly things people are doing. Charlotte thinks exactly the same. It's too much.\" And he gets a bit hot under the collar about cigarettes too. \"Really I am fed up. In record institutions you have four people smoking around you, it's really affecting. I really hate this more and more.\" He screwed up his nose.</p> <p>\"But what I hate the most, I must say, particularly in London, is noisy restaurants. I can't stand that any more. More and more restaurants are like gymnasiums. This Conran is like a railway station.</p> <p>\"I was in this restaurant the other day and I looked around and it was like people were having arguments with one another and I thought to myself we should organise intercoms for people to talk to one another at lunch!\"</p> <p>By now he had completely forgotten himself. \"The next step, the next luxury,\" he said, \"will be to have a quiet place, and to shoot the pianist.\"</p>",

Look, we may have to speed things up a bit. Now, don't be hurrying me. Will you be having a few jars? Perhaps later. Appearance: Well, he was in Dublin for a book signing the other week. No, what does he look like? Pensive. Surely not. His first book, Angela's Ashes, was an international bestseller; the sequel, 'Tis, is doing very nicely; and this week sees the release of the film of Angela's Ashes, starring Emily Watson and Robert Carlyle. This is not by way of being a commercial, is it? Of course not: . . . Because Frank isn't too popular here in Limerick. Why's that? Well, there's a feeling that his book was unfair to his mammy, to the Catholic church, and to the plain folk of Ireland; that he exaggerated the suffering and twisted the truth. Local DJ Gerry Hannon is publishing a riposte to 'Tis called 'Tis In Me Ass. But McCourt's childhood was appalling: alcoholic father, downtrodden mother, dying siblings; ceaseless suffering, hunger and humiliation; sleeping in flea-ridden beds, begging for food, eating out of jam jars . . . To be sure, but think of the spirit of the place, man. Will you be sinking some black? No thanks, not in this dump. Begob! You're as bad as he is. Not to be confused with: The even more miserable Frank Dobson. Do say: \"These ridiculous Oirish expressions serve only to perpetuate an outmoded view of a rapidly changing society.\" Don't say: \"There was a poor Limerick lad / Whose family history was sad / Nothing to eat / No shoes on his feet / Hey, get me an agent!\"",

      "bodyText": "The war is over. Britain's two premier and rival business organisations, the Confederation of British Industry and the Institute of Directors, are burying the hatchet and joining forces to launch a campaign to improve industry's image in the community. Due to be officially announced in the next few weeks, the initiative is seen as heralding a warming of relations between the CBI and IoD, which have been at loggerheads over the business approach to New Labour in power. Leading directors have accused the CBI of being far too cosy with the government, and have been especially critical of the softly-softly approach adopted by Adair Turner, the rival body's director general until the end of last month. The IoD believes that business organisations as a whole - including the CBI - should have taken a far more robust and public stance towards the increased regulations which have been imposed by government via policies such as the minimum wage and the working time directive. George Cox, who has been the IoD's director general for the past four months, is understood to have approached Digby Jones, his new opposite number at the CBI, suggesting that the two groups and the British Chambers of Commerce join forces to run the campaign - and Mr Jones instantly agreed. The initiative embracing the BCC is designed to encourage a \"risk culture\" and to promote a sizeable increase the numbers of entrepreneurs in Britain over the next decade. The BCC, CBI and IoD are now proposing to lead the national enterprise campaign on a rolling basis to prevent it being dissipated in a variety of well-meaning but ultimately ineffective initiatives. The IoD argues that while earlier campaigns such as Business in the Community and the Prince's Trust have achieved much, the culture and attitudes of a large proportion of the population remain hostile and negative towards business. A crucial aim is to build on the IoD's Hub programme and send 1,000 business ambassadors into the community, including schools, to promote greater trust in industry and commerce and counter the widespread view that business leaders care not a fig for their local communities. Mr Cox said: \"Altering the attitude towards business is a huge task; if we are to make any impression it is an area where the major organisations concerned with representing business - albeit from their different standpoints - have to join forces.\"",

Under the direction of Piano, but without Rogers on a formal basis, other firms of architects have been involved in bringing the Pompidou up to date and enabling it to cope with the tidal wave of visitors that had crashed and rolled through its steely interiors since its opening by Val\u00e9ry Giscard-d'Estaing on January 31, 1977. </p> <p>During that time no fewer than 145m visitors came to ride the external escalators with their cinematic views of central Paris and to shoulder their way through great exhibitions devoted to Dali (the most popular of all, in 1980), Matisse and Derain. That's an average of 23,000 a day, and this for a cultural centre designed for an optimistic capacity of 5,000 a day. No wonder the Pompidou was looking shabby and threadbare by the mid-90s. But who now remembers the cavernous lobby with its soiled grey carpet, the tons of grime accumulated on the building's prominently displayed (or \"Bowellist\") ductwork and the lack of proper cafes, bookshop and spaces to unwind? Today the building looks and feels light, airy, almost elegant. This is not just because it sparkles like a liner out of dry dock after a major refit, but also because the west front has been painted a convincing shade of white (with subtle yellow bands behind windows and the undersides of the escalator tubes painted a handsome red), leaving the less visited east front in the toy-like reds and blues that, fashionable among architects back in the mid-70s, seem hard on the retina today. </p> <p>The building has been much modified internally. The admin offices have gone, clearing a whole floor for more art. The vast entrance lobby is much lighter and more welcoming.

On both of these, pre- and post-1950, the pavilions of painting and sculpture lead into others displaying design and architecture. This is a controversial decision in curatorial circles, but it works pretty well, because the selection of architectural drawings and models, of chairs and cameras and even computers (it's fun to see one of those faddish iMacs, dated 1998, already preserved in a display case) has been rigorous.

In one gallery, I found myself surrounded by the architecture and design, wrapped around with the art, that I first published as an assistant editor on the Architectural Review. It was like being surrounded by old friends. There were provocative designs for buildings and furniture by those Italian \"Rationalists\" (Aldo Rossi chief among them) and irrationalists of the 80s - Gaetano Pesce, Andrea Branzi, Michelle de Lucchi, Ettorre Sottsass - that made me smile and which my then editor frowned on with undisguised contempt. They looked great in the magazine, though, and are just as much fun today.

Yet, as the architects agree, the Pompidou was designed for change;they meant that when they were the extremely unlikely winners of the design competition for the Pompidou Centre at the end of the 60s (there were more than 600 entries) and the building really can cope with change now - as it no doubt will again, and again, in the future.</p>",

Less than two years later, the site has more than 500,000 regular users and 80,000 daily browsers. Plans to float next year have valued the company at \u00a3400m, netting its founders Brent Hoberman, 31, and Martha Lane Fox, 26, a combined fortune of around \u00a3150m.</p> <p> Ros Hollingworth's rise to PA to the two directors has been not quite as spectacular, but is no less a success story. She joined the company in August, her first job after graduating from Nottingham university. Originally fancying a career in TV production, her plan to study media was abandoned for a degree in classical civilisation after a year backpacking across Thailand. Her secretarial skills were minimal when she moved to London and began temping. \"I didn't have any office experience so temping was a good way to get started. My typing skills are non-existent, but I was very comfortable with computers after researching and writing my thesis. I had a few interviews for receptionist posts, but when I heard about the job here, I really wanted it.\"</p> <p> Fortunately, Hoberman and Lane Fox were not looking for an experienced, corporate PA. \"I didn't know much about e-commerce or the internet and I was completely honest about my lack of experience. But I managed to show that I have the energy and the willingness to learn. I think the interview established that I would fit in here and have the potential to grow with the company.\"</p> <p> Hollingworth coordinates both directors' diaries, and handles frantic media interest, but in general, she says, they are very self-sufficient. This frees Hollingworth's time to oversee the day-to-day running of lastminute.com alongside the office manager. A major part of this is handling the logistics of a rapid recruitment programme: Hollingworth started as the 40th employee, but over the past five months the staff has increased to 150. Going through online applications on the website's JobBox is a priority. \"Martha was on Question Time recently and mentioned that lastminute.com is always looking for good, energetic people,\" she says. \"I knew that the rest of my week would be taken over with CV sorting but even I was surprised by the overwhelming response.\"</p> <p> It can seem that there is a new face everyday, and Hollingworth is the first port of call. \"I suppose I am seen as the 'office fixer', particularly for new members of staff, but I like that role. I am responsible for getting them set up as quickly as possible in the office with their equipment and stationery and making sure they appear on our website. Everybody answers a fun questionnaire about themselves and gets featured on our 'About Us' page.\" She has had to learn just enough of the programming language HTML to ensure the website is kept up to date. Lastminute.com puts a big emphasis on communication, and on Fridays Hollingworth organises an informal staff lunch for everyone to air their news and views. With an average employee age of 27, there is also plenty of socialising going on and Hollingworth often finds herself arranging these events too. \"It is a very electric, buzzing environment with a real community spirit but you need some serious energy to be able to keep up with the workload and the extra curricular activities. I love the informal atmosphere - there's no dress code and the organisation is truly merit-based - but I have spent quite a few weekends recovering from the previous week in time to regroup for next one.\"</p> <p> But there are two big bonuses in her job: \"No letter typing - everything is done via email and I like that immediacy. I also find working for Martha and Brent inspirational because they are hugely successful but are still sensible human beings. Martha recently spent the day having her photo taken for an Elle feature on inspirational women and was reeling from the shock of hanging around a studio with Claudia Schiffer. I can't really relate to Martha's success, but at times I don't think she can either!\" </p> <p> All employees will be offered stock options when the company floats and Hollingworth says this is an added incentive to contribute to the company.</p> <p> \"Essentially, this is where it's at. Aside from the fact that I love what I do, I am working for the leading lights in e-commerce, developing the most revolutionary industry around. I'm pretty pleased with the first job of my career.\"</p>",

Originally fancying a career in TV production, her plan to study media was abandoned for a degree in classical civilisation after a year backpacking across Thailand. Her secretarial skills were minimal when she moved to London and began temping. \"I didn't have any office experience so temping was a good way to get started. My typing skills are non-existent, but I was very comfortable with computers after researching and writing my thesis. I had a few interviews for receptionist posts, but when I heard about the job here, I really wanted it.\" Fortunately, Hoberman and Lane Fox were not looking for an experienced, corporate PA. \"I didn't know much about e-commerce or the internet and I was completely honest about my lack of experience. But I managed to show that I have the energy and the willingness to learn. I think the interview established that I would fit in here and have the potential to grow with the company.\" Hollingworth coordinates both directors' diaries, and handles frantic media interest, but in general, she says, they are very self-sufficient. This frees Hollingworth's time to oversee the day-to-day running of lastminute.com alongside the office manager. A major part of this is handling the logistics of a rapid recruitment programme: Hollingworth started as the 40th employee, but over the past five months the staff has increased to 150. Going through online applications on the website's JobBox is a priority. \"Martha was on Question Time recently and mentioned that lastminute.com is always looking for good, energetic people,\" she says. \"I knew that the rest of my week would be taken over with CV sorting but even I was surprised by the overwhelming response.\" It can seem that there is a new face everyday, and Hollingworth is the first port of call. \"I suppose I am seen as the 'office fixer', particularly for new members of staff, but I like that role. I am responsible for getting them set up as quickly as possible in the office with their equipment and stationery and making sure they appear on our website. Everybody answers a fun questionnaire about themselves and gets featured on our 'About Us' page.\" She has had to learn just enough of the programming language HTML to ensure the website is kept up to date. Lastminute.com puts a big emphasis on communication, and on Fridays Hollingworth organises an informal staff lunch for everyone to air their news and views. With an average employee age of 27, there is also plenty of socialising going on and Hollingworth often finds herself arranging these events too. \"It is a very electric, buzzing environment with a real community spirit but you need some serious energy to be able to keep up with the workload and the extra curricular activities. I love the informal atmosphere - there's no dress code and the organisation is truly merit-based - but I have spent quite a few weekends recovering from the previous week in time to regroup for next one.\" But there are two big bonuses in her job: \"No letter typing - everything is done via email and I like that immediacy. I also find working for Martha and Brent inspirational because they are hugely successful but are still sensible human beings. Martha recently spent the day having her photo taken for an Elle feature on inspirational women and was reeling from the shock of hanging around a studio with Claudia Schiffer. I can't really relate to Martha's success, but at times I don't think she can either!\" All employees will be offered stock options when the company floats and Hollingworth says this is an added incentive to contribute to the company. \"Essentially, this is where it's at. Aside from the fact that I love what I do, I am working for the leading lights in e-commerce, developing the most revolutionary industry around. I'm pretty pleased with the first job of my career.\"",

What happens, though, when a meeting with your manager doesn't sort out office problems? How bad does it have to get before you stop moaning to colleagues and start talking to your lawyer? </p> <p> Record numbers of workers are now turning to the law to sort out their workplace grievances. In 1998, the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (Acas) reported its biggest ever employment tribunal caseload, a 6% rise to 112,000 claims in just one year. Ten years ago the figure was 50,000.</p> <p> Acas argues that these figures show employees have become more politicised and less complacent. \"People are more aware of their individual rights and are more willing to do something about their grievances,\" says chairman John Hougham. </p> <p> But a glance at the latest report from the TUC suggests another motive - compensation. The trade union umbrella body announced last month that in 1998 it won more than \u00a3308m in compensation from employers for members either injured or made ill at work, an increase of 10% on the previous year and its second highest figure ever. Compensation claims for stress alone soared by 70%. </p> <p> Last year's landmark case of a secretary who successfully sued her employer for stress has crystallised the belief that a compensation culture is beginning to bite in the workplace. Beverley Lancaster, a former Birmingham city council employee, won more than \u00a367,000 for the mental anguish she suffered after being switched from a clerical job to a much more demanding role in a neighbourhood housing office. The Institute of Directors was worried enough to warn its members to expect a tidal wave of copycat compensation claims. </p> <p> So is the workplace becoming more stressful, unhealthy and dangerous, or are we greedier? Certainly high-profile cases with huge awards do encourage others to sue, says Ronnie Fox, an employment law specialist with City law firm Fox Williams. \"We've seen a huge increase in the number of employment disputes of any nature, particularly those involving industrial tribunals, because of the compensatory element.\" </p> <p> But the boom in litigation is not just down to greed, he stresses. Changes in government legislation have given tribunals much greater power to compensate in sex and disability discrimination cases, and have made access to the courts much easier for ordinary workers. One of the most significant changes, for example, is a reduction in the time workers must have been with a firm before being able to claim unfair dismissal - now one year instead of two. Adverts from law firms are now appearing on television offering \"no win, no fee\" representation, while trade unions are quickly expanding their legal services departments to match the new climate.</p> <p> The white collar union MSF (manufacturing, science and finance) is planning to set up a 24-hour call centre for members seeking legal advice. But spokesman Richard O'Brien denies trade unions are actively encouraging workers to sue. \"In most cases you still find that people don't know the system until they find themselves in the situation. We are the first point of call because they need to find out what their rights are.\"</p> <p> Marjorie Mair, head of secretarial and administrative development at the Industrial Society, recently came across the case of a woman who needed to go on a course for her job, but whose manager wouldn't meet the course fees. \"The poor woman rang us to ask if she could pay the \u00a3350 herself in instalments,\" she says. \"The manager refused to discuss the matter and the woman said the incident had upset her enough to make her leave. Potentially she could sue for constructive dismissal.\"</p> <p> The TUC wants to formalise workplace rights even further and is lobbying for a new code of practice on managing stress at work, as well as tougher regulations on working time. But, says Mair, the responsibility for avoiding litigation at work really lies with employers. \"They have got to be both supportive and involving, whatever the scenario, and come up with ways of improving things for the secretary.\"</p> <p> The workplace revolution has seen some secretaries assuming what are effectively managerial roles, while others find themselves marginalised and offered limited opportunities.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The future's bright - you've probably heard that once or twice in the past couple of weeks. But millennial hype aside, it does indeed seem that for administrative and support staff, 2000 looks set to be a bumper year in terms of career opportunities. A new report by employment agency Gordon Yates and the Guardian, which surveyed secretarial employers and employees, has taken a snapshot of the secretarial sector at the turn of the century - and reveals a picture of an industry in bouncing good health.</p> <p> \"A year ago widespread press coverage speculated on the possibility of an economic downturn in the UK,\" says Richard Grace, managing director of Gordon Yates. \"In the event, this didn't happen, and this year's survey suggests that optimism about prospects has strengthened.\" The principal reason for cheer among administrative and support staff is that employment opportunities are booming, which puts skilled secretarial staff at an extremely high premium. Secretarial appointments have been growing healthily for the past five years, but predictions for this year are even rosier - a quarter of firms say they will be hiring more admin staff.</p> <p> Salaries are also up: 1999 saw a 4.4% increase in wage packets, the highest rise in real terms for 10 years. More than half of companies now offer bonuses to their staff, at an average value of \u00a31,648 per employee. And companies are spending an average of \u00a3721 a year to train each of their staff, well up on the previous year. Never had it so good? The figures are certainly persuasive.</p> <p> The increasing emphasis on bonuses and perks is one of the most significant features of the changing secretarial landscape, according to Grace. \"It used to be that a quarter of the workforce got a little extra at Christmas, but now a significant proportion of employers will pay a reasonably chunky bonus. It's a material part of the package that started two or three years ago.\"</p> <p> But this is not necessarily all good news for the milliennial secretary. The increasing popularity of bonuses is partly a way for employers to make jobs more attractive without committing themselves to a salary increase. Wages may be up, but the really high rates witnessed during the last big boom in the late 80s have not, in the main, materialised.</p> <p> And there are other blots on the apparently blossoming landscape. While talented secretaries and PAs are much in demand, a quarter of firms say it is increasingly difficult to find good staff. \"We have a huge influx of jobs but extremely good candidates aren't walking through our doors at a rate of knots,\" says Jane Littlefield, manager of the secretarial division at employment agency Joslin Rowe. \"To find a good calibre candidate with good skills and shorthand seems to be asking the earth these days.\" </p> <p> This might be because employers are becoming more demanding. Aside from shorthand, the skills employers nominate as being in short supply centre almost entirely on attitude, the so-called \"soft skills\".

      "bodyText": "The future's bright - you've probably heard that once or twice in the past couple of weeks. But millennial hype aside, it does indeed seem that for administrative and support staff, 2000 looks set to be a bumper year in terms of career opportunities. A new report by employment agency Gordon Yates and the Guardian, which surveyed secretarial employers and employees, has taken a snapshot of the secretarial sector at the turn of the century - and reveals a picture of an industry in bouncing good health. \"A year ago widespread press coverage speculated on the possibility of an economic downturn in the UK,\" says Richard Grace, managing director of Gordon Yates. \"In the event, this didn't happen, and this year's survey suggests that optimism about prospects has strengthened.\" The principal reason for cheer among administrative and support staff is that employment opportunities are booming, which puts skilled secretarial staff at an extremely high premium. Secretarial appointments have been growing healthily for the past five years, but predictions for this year are even rosier - a quarter of firms say they will be hiring more admin staff. Salaries are also up: 1999 saw a 4.4% increase in wage packets, the highest rise in real terms for 10 years. More than half of companies now offer bonuses to their staff, at an average value of \u00a31,648 per employee. And companies are spending an average of \u00a3721 a year to train each of their staff, well up on the previous year. Never had it so good? The figures are certainly persuasive. The increasing emphasis on bonuses and perks is one of the most significant features of the changing secretarial landscape, according to Grace. \"It used to be that a quarter of the workforce got a little extra at Christmas, but now a significant proportion of employers will pay a reasonably chunky bonus. It's a material part of the package that started two or three years ago.\" But this is not necessarily all good news for the milliennial secretary. The increasing popularity of bonuses is partly a way for employers to make jobs more attractive without committing themselves to a salary increase. Wages may be up, but the really high rates witnessed during the last big boom in the late 80s have not, in the main, materialised. And there are other blots on the apparently blossoming landscape. While talented secretaries and PAs are much in demand, a quarter of firms say it is increasingly difficult to find good staff. \"We have a huge influx of jobs but extremely good candidates aren't walking through our doors at a rate of knots,\" says Jane Littlefield, manager of the secretarial division at employment agency Joslin Rowe. \"To find a good calibre candidate with good skills and shorthand seems to be asking the earth these days.\" This might be because employers are becoming more demanding. Aside from shorthand, the skills employers nominate as being in short supply centre almost entirely on attitude, the so-called \"soft skills\".
