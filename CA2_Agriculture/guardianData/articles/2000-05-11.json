Though parallel trading - customers buying in from abroad - had increased, he warned: \"It is apparent that manufacturers are not too pleased if dealers engage in parallel trade and dealers are afraid to displease their manufacturer. \"Therefore I do not attach too much importance to the fact that parallel trade into the UK has tripled for some manufacturers in the last two years. What matters is that it is still insufficient to put downward pressure on UK prices.\" He drew attention to the campaign by the Consumers Association in Britain which complained consumers were being \"ripped off\". He said he had been sent 20,000 protest notes signed by British consumers.",

His athletically hybrid style was demotic but classy, and in 1966 when Rambert made its own transition from ballet company to modern dance ensemble, Tetley provided much of its initial repertory.

Bruce's beautiful line and unworldly modesty made him an ideal Pierrot; now as Rambert's director he has the poignant task of helping Conor O'Brien recreate that role. O'Brien is uncannily like his mentor and the degree to which Pierrot looks as strange and vivid on stage as it once did owes much to his magnificent performance. </p> <p>It is a herculean role, powered by eccentric changes of mood, and O'Brien not only has an instinctive feel for the choreography's line, he retains a purity of demeanour which stops him looking twee.

Naturally, the night didn't remain so sedate. </p> <p>The Lips' opening proper came with their last single, Race for the Prize, which was fiercely frazzling and jubilant; an odd feeling, especially since nuclear detonations were screening on the video backdrop.

      "bodyText": "The mere appearance of a mini-Rank Films gong on the stage of the Glasgow Garage sparked crazed whooping throughout the audience in anticipation of the lo-fi multi-media extravaganza that was to follow. The assembled were distinctly hardcore fans of the Flaming Lips and knew what to expect. Kind of. As they swapped previous Lips' experiences - agreeing that no two gigs were the same - a patchwork of pixels materialised on the giant video screen at the back of the stage. The whooping turned cacophonous and a mourning guitar, which sounded like Air meets the Foo Fighters on a soporific Sunday afternoon, glided in above a filmic string chorus. Naturally, the night didn't remain so sedate. The Lips' opening proper came with their last single, Race for the Prize, which was fiercely frazzling and jubilant; an odd feeling, especially since nuclear detonations were screening on the video backdrop. Contradicting and enforcing the mood of the songs, the band take pride in their visuals. Like karaoke videos made by Stanley Kubrick, they are both weirdly dissonant and apposite. With a mini camera positioned in front of the band, there was no escaping the Oklahoma City trio's comic, poignant and hallucinogenic bents. Especially when the rubber glove puppets came out.

      "body": "<p>I once wrote the front-page splash for the Daily Mirror. And the subs never changed a single comma or exclamation mark. Ever since I have considered myself a real journalist - although the truth is that only one other person knew about my scoop. And now, alas and grievously out of the blue, he is dead. </p> <p>On May 21 1980, in the one-horse Afrikaans stronghold of Potchefstroom, I was sharing a hotel room with Chris Lander of the Daily Mirror. The Lions that afternoon had beaten a South African Select XV and, after both of us had telephoned our reports back to London over the crackly, intermittent landline, Chris decided on a night in the city, telephoned a lady (he had a phone book more female-full than any veteran matelot's) and set off on the two- or three-hour drive to wine her in Johannesburg. He was now incommunicado. </p> <p>In no time an angry phone rang from London: \"Where's Lander?\" barked the Mirror. \"Er, just popped out,\" I stalled. \"We've had an exclusive tip that the Lions' next match against Zimbabwe in Harare is off because of the Lions' connections with apartheid, so will you tell Lander when he 'pops back' that a copytaker will ring him in 10 minutes and I want 15 paragraphs.\" </p> <p>I shedded my inborn Guardian pretentiousness and cobbled together some breathless, deathless Mirrorese . . . \"IN A DRAMATIC SNUB TO BRITISH SPORTSMEN LAST NIGHT, NEW TYRANT 'RED BOB' MUGABE BANNED . . .\" </p> <p>Chris arrived back in the morning, bleary and amazed to find the next leg of the tour was off.

Ever since I have considered myself a real journalist - although the truth is that only one other person knew about my scoop. And now, alas and grievously out of the blue, he is dead. On May 21 1980, in the one-horse Afrikaans stronghold of Potchefstroom, I was sharing a hotel room with Chris Lander of the Daily Mirror. The Lions that afternoon had beaten a South African Select XV and, after both of us had telephoned our reports back to London over the crackly, intermittent landline, Chris decided on a night in the city, telephoned a lady (he had a phone book more female-full than any veteran matelot's) and set off on the two- or three-hour drive to wine her in Johannesburg. He was now incommunicado. In no time an angry phone rang from London: \"Where's Lander?\" barked the Mirror. \"Er, just popped out,\" I stalled. \"We've had an exclusive tip that the Lions' next match against Zimbabwe in Harare is off because of the Lions' connections with apartheid, so will you tell Lander when he 'pops back' that a copytaker will ring him in 10 minutes and I want 15 paragraphs.\" I shedded my inborn Guardian pretentiousness and cobbled together some breathless, deathless Mirrorese . . . \"IN A DRAMATIC SNUB TO BRITISH SPORTSMEN LAST NIGHT, NEW TYRANT 'RED BOB' MUGABE BANNED . . .\" Chris arrived back in the morning, bleary and amazed to find the next leg of the tour was off. A wire, a \"hooray-o-gram\", was waiting for him from London. Congrats on front-page splash scoop. He would, of course, have done the same for me - and made a much better fist of parodying the Guardian style. He was 59 when he died. He joined the Mirror, to cover cricket and rugby, more than 30 years ago and his scintillating company made him the life, soul and heartbeat of press boxes the world over - fun and laughter. Chris will doubtless already be writing out the batting order - or chewing it over with eminence Jim Swanton, who died in January - for his Celestial Press XI, and no problems with numbers either, for our trade and once merry freemasonry has been suddenly and wretchedly blighted of late. In less than three years, sadness upon sadness, cricket has lost - most well before their time - such writing stalwarts (heavy and light, posh and pop) as Alan Gibson, John Parker, David Lemmon, Doug Ibbotson, Geoff Nicholson, Christopher Wordsworth, Don Mosey, Harold Abel, John Kay, Michael Melford and even, at 50, Lander's buddy and soul mate from the Mirror, Colin Price.

      "bodyText": "Unless ticket sales pick up there will be a record low attendance for the opening day of a test at Lord's when England begin their two-match series against Zimbabwe next Thursday. Only 7,500 tickets have so far been sold for the first day with a figure of 10,000 for the second and third days. No tickets have been sold for the final two days. The record opening-day low attendance was in 1986 when only 11,854 turned up to watch the start of England's test against India. The England and Wales Cricket Board has been attempting to put a brave face on the sluggish sales and claimed that it could represent a rare chance for \"walk-up\" spectators to pay at the gate. An ECB spokesman said: \"You can't turn up at football matches and pay at the gate so this is a great opportunity for people who do not normally stand a chance of getting into Lord's of buying a ticket for a test match.\" Theories put forward to explain the poor sales ranged from bad weather, the long football season, the early start to the test series and a lack of awareness about Zimbabwe cricket in general or even that the country's first tour of England was taking place at all. But there are no plans to increase publicity for the test series in the hope of boosting sales. ECB officials are hoping that word will spread on the amount of tickets available and that many fans will turn up and pay on the day. The chief executive Tim Lamb said: \"There are plenty of tickets available for next week's Zimbabwe test match and we would urge the wider cricket public to take advantage of this opportunity to come along and enjoy the unique atmosphere.\" Yesterday staff answered a handful of calls in a valiant attempt to shift tickets priced at \u00a318, \u00a324, \u00a328 and \u00a332. \"We've got thousands of them available,\" said one seller. \"You can have as many as you want and sit where you want. Nobody is interested in this test match.\" Normally, tickets for tests have to be purchased months in advance and many fans complain that they have been driven out by corporate guests who show more appreciation of the food and drink that is served up than they do of the cricket on show.",

Most families are living in the open, without clothes, blankets or clean water. The mud hut that calls itself a hospital contains nothing but flies. The young man in charge, a farmer-turned-health worker, says 200 children and 50 old people are already in urgent need of medical care. He is treating them with tree leaves and bark, but he needs anti-malarials and antibiotics.</p> <p>Less than a year after international pressure forced Sudan's Islamist government to allow United Nations relief into the Nuba mountains for the first time in more than a decade, Khartoum is attempting to put the Nuba beyond the reach of relief by cutting off all access to the mountains and starving civilians out of areas controlled by the rebels of the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA).</p> <p>In the past two months, moving in whenever United Nations teams move out, government forces have captured two of the three rough airstrips that make relief operations possible and have mounted a surprise assault on some of the Nuba's most productive land around the village of Tabanya.</p> <p>The UN's silence has been almost as shocking to the Nuba as the attack on Tabanya that displaced 15,000 people and propelled them towards Kadoro - a mountain village of 150 families that has shared its own meagre supplies for more than a month and now has nothing more to offer.</p> <p>\"The UN's own first mission to the mountains was heavily shelled - but it has never said a word of criticism of the government,\" said Walid Hamed, assistant to a rebel commander, Yusuf Kuwa. \"When it comes to the government, the UN is on its knees. All we are asking is equal treatment so people can decide freely whether they stay in SPLA areas or go to the government.\"</p> <p>The Nuba are in their 13th year of struggle for a democratic, secular state in which the country's African south would be the equal of its Arab north. Since the fundamentalist generals of the National Islamic Front came to power in 1989, an attempt to defeat the Nuba rebellion has grown into a scorched-earth holy war of annihilation against a people whose tradition of political and religious tolerance threatens the Front's whole project of a conformist Islamic extremism.</p> <p>Today hundreds of thousands of Nuba starved out of the mountains are imprisoned in \"peace villages\" where men are armed and compelled to fight against fellow Nuba; where children are separated from their parents and conscripted into Islamic militias; where women are raped to dilute Nuba ethnicity.</p> <p>Nuba who refuse to leave SPLA-controlled areas are being driven off the fertile plains and into the mountains where survival is a struggle. Even the UN acknowledges that women venturing down to the government-controlled plains to fetch water and mangoes are subjected to rape \"often of the most horrendous kind\".</p> <p>As evidence of human rights abuses piles up, the government promises relief but fights with the oldest, and cruellest, weapon in its arsenal - hunger.</p> <p>Rahila Kuku, a mother of five, was put to work gathering in the sorghum that was thick in the fields surrounding Tabanya at the time of the attack on the village on March 17. She says hundreds of prisoners, working at gunpoint, stripped the sorghum fields bare and loaded every grain on to trucks bound for government garrisons in other parts of the mountains.</p> <p>Rahila escaped to Kadoro after being raped repeatedly over a month, but at the hospital has found only words of comfort - not the painkillers she wants. She says her body still hurts from the beatings she received and her breasts are sore. She suspects she is pregnant.</p> <p>Phoebe Tutu fled to Kadoro with nine children and a jerrycan when the first government troops attacked Tabanya. Forced off Kadoro mountain by hunger, she joined a group of 30 women foraging for food on the edge of government-controlled areas a four-hour walk away. The women were ambushed and four died. Phoebe was shot and wounded. Reduced to one small plate of sorghum a day, all her children are suffering from diarrhoea.</p> <p>The government's capture of Toro airstrip near Tabanya has put the displaced almost beyond the reach of help. The nearest airstrip is now 120km away - a three-day trek up granite mountains and down valleys where water holes are drying up and government troops lay ambushes for defenceless civilians.</p> <p>\"At one stroke, the attack on Tabanya has cut people off from their harvest and also from easy access from outside,\" said Paul Savage of the British charity Christian Aid. \"It now takes a huge logistical effort across insecure and dangerous areas to bring the smallest amount of help to the displaced. This is a planned and purposeful undermining of the Nuba's resilience and capacity to cope and exist.\"</p> <p>Zakariah Suleiman, an elderly farmer, was among those captured in the Tabanya offensive. For three days he was forced to work for the government forces. \"They burned all the far sorghum and collected all the near sorghum,\" he said. \"They sent us out every day in large groups protected by soldiers.

      "bodyText": "In a few weeks, barring miracles, the children in this region of southern Sudan will begin to die - if not from hunger, then from disease. Most families are living in the open, without clothes, blankets or clean water. The mud hut that calls itself a hospital contains nothing but flies. The young man in charge, a farmer-turned-health worker, says 200 children and 50 old people are already in urgent need of medical care. He is treating them with tree leaves and bark, but he needs anti-malarials and antibiotics. Less than a year after international pressure forced Sudan's Islamist government to allow United Nations relief into the Nuba mountains for the first time in more than a decade, Khartoum is attempting to put the Nuba beyond the reach of relief by cutting off all access to the mountains and starving civilians out of areas controlled by the rebels of the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA). In the past two months, moving in whenever United Nations teams move out, government forces have captured two of the three rough airstrips that make relief operations possible and have mounted a surprise assault on some of the Nuba's most productive land around the village of Tabanya. The UN's silence has been almost as shocking to the Nuba as the attack on Tabanya that displaced 15,000 people and propelled them towards Kadoro - a mountain village of 150 families that has shared its own meagre supplies for more than a month and now has nothing more to offer. \"The UN's own first mission to the mountains was heavily shelled - but it has never said a word of criticism of the government,\" said Walid Hamed, assistant to a rebel commander, Yusuf Kuwa. \"When it comes to the government, the UN is on its knees. All we are asking is equal treatment so people can decide freely whether they stay in SPLA areas or go to the government.\" The Nuba are in their 13th year of struggle for a democratic, secular state in which the country's African south would be the equal of its Arab north. Since the fundamentalist generals of the National Islamic Front came to power in 1989, an attempt to defeat the Nuba rebellion has grown into a scorched-earth holy war of annihilation against a people whose tradition of political and religious tolerance threatens the Front's whole project of a conformist Islamic extremism. Today hundreds of thousands of Nuba starved out of the mountains are imprisoned in \"peace villages\" where men are armed and compelled to fight against fellow Nuba; where children are separated from their parents and conscripted into Islamic militias; where women are raped to dilute Nuba ethnicity. Nuba who refuse to leave SPLA-controlled areas are being driven off the fertile plains and into the mountains where survival is a struggle. Even the UN acknowledges that women venturing down to the government-controlled plains to fetch water and mangoes are subjected to rape \"often of the most horrendous kind\". As evidence of human rights abuses piles up, the government promises relief but fights with the oldest, and cruellest, weapon in its arsenal - hunger. Rahila Kuku, a mother of five, was put to work gathering in the sorghum that was thick in the fields surrounding Tabanya at the time of the attack on the village on March 17. She says hundreds of prisoners, working at gunpoint, stripped the sorghum fields bare and loaded every grain on to trucks bound for government garrisons in other parts of the mountains. Rahila escaped to Kadoro after being raped repeatedly over a month, but at the hospital has found only words of comfort - not the painkillers she wants. She says her body still hurts from the beatings she received and her breasts are sore. She suspects she is pregnant. Phoebe Tutu fled to Kadoro with nine children and a jerrycan when the first government troops attacked Tabanya. Forced off Kadoro mountain by hunger, she joined a group of 30 women foraging for food on the edge of government-controlled areas a four-hour walk away. The women were ambushed and four died. Phoebe was shot and wounded. Reduced to one small plate of sorghum a day, all her children are suffering from diarrhoea. The government's capture of Toro airstrip near Tabanya has put the displaced almost beyond the reach of help. The nearest airstrip is now 120km away - a three-day trek up granite mountains and down valleys where water holes are drying up and government troops lay ambushes for defenceless civilians. \"At one stroke, the attack on Tabanya has cut people off from their harvest and also from easy access from outside,\" said Paul Savage of the British charity Christian Aid. \"It now takes a huge logistical effort across insecure and dangerous areas to bring the smallest amount of help to the displaced. This is a planned and purposeful undermining of the Nuba's resilience and capacity to cope and exist.\" Zakariah Suleiman, an elderly farmer, was among those captured in the Tabanya offensive. For three days he was forced to work for the government forces. \"They burned all the far sorghum and collected all the near sorghum,\" he said. \"They sent us out every day in large groups protected by soldiers. This is their weapon against us: hunger. They have taken everything from Tabanya - sorghum, beans and maize. Nothing is left.\" Like Rahila Kuku, Suleiman succeeded in escaping from Tabanya and fled to Kadoro - fully aware that he was running from hunger to hunger. \"I'm happy to be here whether I find food or not,\" he said. \"I have left everything behind, but I don't care if I'm naked or clothed. Here I can go wherever I want to without asking for permission . . . I may die of hunger here, but I'll die free - not penned in like an animal.\" The Observer",

In March this year he walked into Beeston police station and told officers he wanted to confess to committing a serious sexual assault on a 14-year-old boy. He was seen by a police surgeon and declared fit for interview before making a confession which he later declared was a \"cry for help\". Mr Straw was not charged when an investigation by Nottinghamshire police failed to find evidence. Mr Straw is regional secretary of the Open University in Nottingham.",

Since 1993 staff have launched 22 claims, and last October a tribunal made the third finding of race discrimination against the service in less than a year.</p> <p>David Calvert-Smith, director of public prosecutions, said: \"This is a hard-hitting report which makes uncomfortable reading for all managers in the CPS. I have said many times that I will not tolerate racism, which is why diversity is a key aim in our business plans this year.</p> <p>\"I am determined that equality and diversity will be woven into the fabric and ethos of the CPS so that we become a truly diverse organisation.\"</p> <p>Ms Denman, who will deliver a final report later this year, said it would be \"precipitate\" to reach a firm conclusion on institutional racism in her preliminary report. \"However, the evidence given so far to the inquiry, seen in the light of the persistent pattern of under-representation of ethnic minorities at higher grades and the serious findings of discrimination made against the CPS by employment tribunals, provides strong prima facie evidence that some forms of race discrimination and institutional racism have operated to the disadvantage of black and Asian staff.\"</p> <p>Last February, a tribunal awarded a record \u00a330,000 for injury to feelings to Maria Bamieh, a crown prosecutor, after finding that the CPS wanted to \"rub her nose in the dirt\" following her two earlier successful claims for race discrimination and victimisation. The tribunal said the service's conduct fell below the standard \"we would have expected of a corner shop\".</p> <p>Ms Denman suggested barriers to recruitment and promotion for ethnic minority lawyers might be due to the dominance of a clique of white managers, the discriminatory conduct of promotion boards, and a lack of sensitivity by management to race issues. These will have to be examined in more detail before firm conclusions are reached. Barriers to recruitment undoubtedly operate in some areas, which have no or virtually no black staff, she said.</p> <p>Many ethnic minority staff believed they had been discriminated against - far more than those who had lodged formal grievances or taken cases to tribunals. \"There is a particularly strong perception that white managers have discriminated in relation to the advancement and promotion of black and Asian staff.\"</p> <p>Ms Denman said recent statements and action plans by management \"lack coherence and are heavy on ambitious declarations of intent\". There was \"a tendency within the service to overreact and panic in the face of allegations of race discrimination\".</p> <p>Faced with the evidence, managers continued to deny that there was racism. \"When confronted with the statistical evidence, their first reaction was to seek an 'innocent' explanation. It is a matter of concern that there was a noticeable reluctance on the part of some managers to contemplate the possibility of a serious problem.\"</p>",

I have said many times that I will not tolerate racism, which is why diversity is a key aim in our business plans this year. \"I am determined that equality and diversity will be woven into the fabric and ethos of the CPS so that we become a truly diverse organisation.\" Ms Denman, who will deliver a final report later this year, said it would be \"precipitate\" to reach a firm conclusion on institutional racism in her preliminary report. \"However, the evidence given so far to the inquiry, seen in the light of the persistent pattern of under-representation of ethnic minorities at higher grades and the serious findings of discrimination made against the CPS by employment tribunals, provides strong prima facie evidence that some forms of race discrimination and institutional racism have operated to the disadvantage of black and Asian staff.\" Last February, a tribunal awarded a record \u00a330,000 for injury to feelings to Maria Bamieh, a crown prosecutor, after finding that the CPS wanted to \"rub her nose in the dirt\" following her two earlier successful claims for race discrimination and victimisation. The tribunal said the service's conduct fell below the standard \"we would have expected of a corner shop\". Ms Denman suggested barriers to recruitment and promotion for ethnic minority lawyers might be due to the dominance of a clique of white managers, the discriminatory conduct of promotion boards, and a lack of sensitivity by management to race issues. These will have to be examined in more detail before firm conclusions are reached. Barriers to recruitment undoubtedly operate in some areas, which have no or virtually no black staff, she said. Many ethnic minority staff believed they had been discriminated against - far more than those who had lodged formal grievances or taken cases to tribunals. \"There is a particularly strong perception that white managers have discriminated in relation to the advancement and promotion of black and Asian staff.\" Ms Denman said recent statements and action plans by management \"lack coherence and are heavy on ambitious declarations of intent\". There was \"a tendency within the service to overreact and panic in the face of allegations of race discrimination\". Faced with the evidence, managers continued to deny that there was racism. \"When confronted with the statistical evidence, their first reaction was to seek an 'innocent' explanation. It is a matter of concern that there was a noticeable reluctance on the part of some managers to contemplate the possibility of a serious problem.\"",

      "body": "<p>Supermarket loyalty cards are past their sell-by date, according to Safeway. The company announced last week that after five years it is cancelling its ABC card, arguing that shoppers have got bored with collecting points and would prefer to see the money spent on price cuts. \"People don't think they give value,\" said Safeway's chief executive Carlos Criado-Perez. \"They'll never get tired of great deals.\" </p> <p>The move follows Asda's decision last year to abandon its own trial scheme in favour of the \"rollback\" price-cutting strategy. But are high-street reward schemes really nearing the end of their shelf-life? The schemes have certainly been a phenomenal success since Tesco launched the first supermarket card in 1995 and was swiftly imitated by most of its big rivals. The idea is that when customers collect points in exchange for money spent in the store they are likely to be more \"loyal\" in where they chose to shop. Retailers in turn can collate detailed data on their shoppers' spending habits. </p> <p>For a while retailers and shoppers couldn't get enough of reward cards; Boots, WHSmith, Homebase and BhS were quick to follow the supermarkets. But loyalty cards have been a victim of their own success. Three-quarters of us now use them, and the more we can sign up for the better. Over half of those with a Sainsbury's Reward card hold a Tesco Clubcard; 42% of Tesco cardholders have a Sainsbury's card. Consumers' wallets are bulging with plastic and they simply produce the right card for whichever shop they are in. So much for loyalty. </p> <p>If shoppers are becoming jaded it is also because they have recognised that the return on cards is minimal. According to the Consumer Association's magazine, Which?, the average annual grocery spend is \u00a32,900. So the standard supermarket reward of 1% would give a return of just \u00a329 a year. It's better than nothing, but hardly enough to buy a customer's unstinting loyalty. </p> <p>As shoppers collect a full pack of loyalty cards, supermarkets are having to be increasingly imaginative in the rewards they offer. Safeway has routinely been offering double and treble points on the ABC card, while Tesco launched a parallel reward scheme in August, where customers get a \"key\" for every \u00a325 spent, 50 of which can be exchanged for travel-related deals. Sainsbury's, oddly, has halved the denomination of its points, \"so one old reward point is worth two new reward points\", as a spokesperson carefully explained. It's something to do with \"flexibility\", apparently. The company also introduced a number of high street tie-ins; shoppers get double the usual value of their points if they are redeemed at Burton, Top Shop or Principles. </p> <p>Even high-street favourite Boots is planning a relaunch - its Advantage card will evolve in September into a \"loyalty credit card\". This curious hybrid will function like a normal visa card (run by Egg, the banking offshoot of Prudential), but cardholders will accrue one loyalty point for every \u00a31 spent on the card, or five points per \u00a31 if the purchase is at Boots. Once you have collected 4,500 - that's \u00a3900 worth of shampoo and toothpaste - you can have a day out at a leisure club. </p> <p>\"The market has slowed down now,\" says Tess Sullivan, senior researcher at Which? \"People are more aware of cards, and in particular how long it takes to get decent rewards from them. I don't expect we'll see many more new schemes.\" </p> <p>Customer familiarity aside, Safeway is also abandoning its scheme because of the huge cost. Profits have been falling, and the \u00a350m saved by cancelling the loyalty cards is to be redirected into a price-cutting strategy. \"We have got a new chief executive, and his strategy is based on stealing other people's customers,\" says Emma Mason, the company's head of PR. \"Loyalty cards allow you to talk to existing customers, but they don't help you reach new customers. We are going to spend the money on big cut-price deals.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, Sainsbury's appears to be piggybacking on the publicity generated by its competitor's new tack, announcing yesterday that Safeway shoppers will get 500 free points on if they exchange their old ABC card for a Sainsbury's one. </p> <p>So why do supermarkets continue to operate the schemes if customers aren't learning to be more loyal? A survey by the market analysts Mintel found that Morrison's, a relatively small supermarket chain, has the highest proportion of loyal customers. According to Morrison's, the secret of its success is that it doesn't run a reward scheme. </p> <p>\"If a supermarket operates a loyalty scheme just to give away points, it's not good value,\" says Richard Caines of Mintel. \"The value is in the data generated on shoppers' habits. If they use it for planning, then it's very useful.\" When Boots, for example, analysed shopping patterns among its loyalty cardholders, it found a link between the purchase of baby products and photographic goods - when you have a baby, goes the logic, you want to send pictures to grandparents. The store now puts its camera films close to its nappies. </p> <p>This sort of information can be enormously valuable to a retailer, but not, according to Mason, so valuable that is justifies the huge cost of the schemes. \"To have data on 6m customers coming through our stores every week - it wasn't manageable. The data wasn't being used properly, and I defy anyone else to tell you that they use the data properly.\" </p> <p>\"It's hard to foresee what will happen with loyalty cards,\" says Sullivan. \"I don't expect Tesco or Sainsbury's to drop their cards in the near future, but they are always looking for new ways of marketing against each other. Loyalty cards were once a new way of doing this, but not any longer.

      "bodyText": "Supermarket loyalty cards are past their sell-by date, according to Safeway. The company announced last week that after five years it is cancelling its ABC card, arguing that shoppers have got bored with collecting points and would prefer to see the money spent on price cuts. \"People don't think they give value,\" said Safeway's chief executive Carlos Criado-Perez. \"They'll never get tired of great deals.\" The move follows Asda's decision last year to abandon its own trial scheme in favour of the \"rollback\" price-cutting strategy. But are high-street reward schemes really nearing the end of their shelf-life? The schemes have certainly been a phenomenal success since Tesco launched the first supermarket card in 1995 and was swiftly imitated by most of its big rivals. The idea is that when customers collect points in exchange for money spent in the store they are likely to be more \"loyal\" in where they chose to shop. Retailers in turn can collate detailed data on their shoppers' spending habits. For a while retailers and shoppers couldn't get enough of reward cards; Boots, WHSmith, Homebase and BhS were quick to follow the supermarkets. But loyalty cards have been a victim of their own success. Three-quarters of us now use them, and the more we can sign up for the better. Over half of those with a Sainsbury's Reward card hold a Tesco Clubcard; 42% of Tesco cardholders have a Sainsbury's card. Consumers' wallets are bulging with plastic and they simply produce the right card for whichever shop they are in. So much for loyalty. If shoppers are becoming jaded it is also because they have recognised that the return on cards is minimal. According to the Consumer Association's magazine, Which?, the average annual grocery spend is \u00a32,900. So the standard supermarket reward of 1% would give a return of just \u00a329 a year. It's better than nothing, but hardly enough to buy a customer's unstinting loyalty. As shoppers collect a full pack of loyalty cards, supermarkets are having to be increasingly imaginative in the rewards they offer. Safeway has routinely been offering double and treble points on the ABC card, while Tesco launched a parallel reward scheme in August, where customers get a \"key\" for every \u00a325 spent, 50 of which can be exchanged for travel-related deals. Sainsbury's, oddly, has halved the denomination of its points, \"so one old reward point is worth two new reward points\", as a spokesperson carefully explained. It's something to do with \"flexibility\", apparently. The company also introduced a number of high street tie-ins; shoppers get double the usual value of their points if they are redeemed at Burton, Top Shop or Principles. Even high-street favourite Boots is planning a relaunch - its Advantage card will evolve in September into a \"loyalty credit card\". This curious hybrid will function like a normal visa card (run by Egg, the banking offshoot of Prudential), but cardholders will accrue one loyalty point for every \u00a31 spent on the card, or five points per \u00a31 if the purchase is at Boots. Once you have collected 4,500 - that's \u00a3900 worth of shampoo and toothpaste - you can have a day out at a leisure club. \"The market has slowed down now,\" says Tess Sullivan, senior researcher at Which? \"People are more aware of cards, and in particular how long it takes to get decent rewards from them. I don't expect we'll see many more new schemes.\" Customer familiarity aside, Safeway is also abandoning its scheme because of the huge cost. Profits have been falling, and the \u00a350m saved by cancelling the loyalty cards is to be redirected into a price-cutting strategy. \"We have got a new chief executive, and his strategy is based on stealing other people's customers,\" says Emma Mason, the company's head of PR. \"Loyalty cards allow you to talk to existing customers, but they don't help you reach new customers. We are going to spend the money on big cut-price deals.\" Meanwhile, Sainsbury's appears to be piggybacking on the publicity generated by its competitor's new tack, announcing yesterday that Safeway shoppers will get 500 free points on if they exchange their old ABC card for a Sainsbury's one. So why do supermarkets continue to operate the schemes if customers aren't learning to be more loyal? A survey by the market analysts Mintel found that Morrison's, a relatively small supermarket chain, has the highest proportion of loyal customers. According to Morrison's, the secret of its success is that it doesn't run a reward scheme. \"If a supermarket operates a loyalty scheme just to give away points, it's not good value,\" says Richard Caines of Mintel. \"The value is in the data generated on shoppers' habits. If they use it for planning, then it's very useful.\" When Boots, for example, analysed shopping patterns among its loyalty cardholders, it found a link between the purchase of baby products and photographic goods - when you have a baby, goes the logic, you want to send pictures to grandparents. The store now puts its camera films close to its nappies. This sort of information can be enormously valuable to a retailer, but not, according to Mason, so valuable that is justifies the huge cost of the schemes. \"To have data on 6m customers coming through our stores every week - it wasn't manageable. The data wasn't being used properly, and I defy anyone else to tell you that they use the data properly.\" \"It's hard to foresee what will happen with loyalty cards,\" says Sullivan. \"I don't expect Tesco or Sainsbury's to drop their cards in the near future, but they are always looking for new ways of marketing against each other. Loyalty cards were once a new way of doing this, but not any longer. If they come up with a better way of targeting customers they will certainly do so.\" Mason is more frank: \"Retail moves very quickly, and loyalty cards have already been around for five years. In any case, they are nothing to do with loyalty. They are just an old gimmick.\" House of cards Boots: Boots offers a 4% return, well ahead of the supermarkets. Their \"pampering card\" is explicity aimed at women, and 4,500 points (a spend of \u00a31,125) can be exchanged for a day at a leisure club.

Tests on volunteers showed no effect on short-term memory or attention span after exposure to microwave radiation of up to 30 minutes.

The report concluded that the balance of evidence indicated there was no general risk to the health of people living near base stations, but there could be indirect adverse affects on their well-being in some cases. It recommended no further development should be permitted at existing base stations, including those with masts under 15 metres, and the location of new stations should be subject to the normal planning process. In relation to base stations located near schools, the inquiry team recommended that the beam of greatest intensity should not fall on any part of the school grounds or buildings without agreement from school and parents. </p> <p> <b>What about research in other areas? </b><br> Two experiments, one at Nottingham University and the other at the University of Washington, Seattle, have suggested that microwaves could produce stress in animals.</p> <p> <b>And is Sir William following his own advice? </b><br> He said that when his grandchildren, now four and two, were a few years older, he would not recommend allowing them \"unfettered access\" to mobile phones. He could see the benefit for children who might be out late at night having access to mobile phones for essential calls. The inquiry team could not provide further guidelines about how many minutes a day a child should use a mobile phone because it depended on variables such as how the phone was held, the type of phone, or whether it was hands-free. \"The shortest time that a child needs for essential calls is the amount of time it should use,\" he said. </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.iegmp.org.uk/IEGMPtxt.htm\" target=\"_new\">The report into mobile phones and health</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mobile\" target=\"_new\">Special report</a></p>",

The panel of experts working with Sir William, which included physicists, engineers and neuro-scientists, recommended stricter controls on the location of mobile phone base stations and masts. The report concluded that the balance of evidence indicated there was no general risk to the health of people living near base stations, but there could be indirect adverse affects on their well-being in some cases. It recommended no further development should be permitted at existing base stations, including those with masts under 15 metres, and the location of new stations should be subject to the normal planning process. In relation to base stations located near schools, the inquiry team recommended that the beam of greatest intensity should not fall on any part of the school grounds or buildings without agreement from school and parents. What about research in other areas? Two experiments, one at Nottingham University and the other at the University of Washington, Seattle, have suggested that microwaves could produce stress in animals. And is Sir William following his own advice? He said that when his grandchildren, now four and two, were a few years older, he would not recommend allowing them \"unfettered access\" to mobile phones. He could see the benefit for children who might be out late at night having access to mobile phones for essential calls. The inquiry team could not provide further guidelines about how many minutes a day a child should use a mobile phone because it depended on variables such as how the phone was held, the type of phone, or whether it was hands-free. \"The shortest time that a child needs for essential calls is the amount of time it should use,\" he said.

Ford will also recommit itself to a multi-million-pound plan to regenerate the Thames corridor around the Dagenham factory. Ford has refused to confirm any of the speculation about the future of its 8,000 workers at Dagenham, which produced its first vehicle in 1931 and today manufactures the ailing Fiesta. Following Ford's Europe-wide review of its operations, car assembly is expected to be phased out by November next year, leaving the site reliant on engine production and other manufacturing work. Ford said earlier this year it was axing 1,300 jobs at Dagenham, so the plant would be left employing just over 4,000 workers after the fresh job losses. Martin O'Neill, Labour chairman of the Commons trade and industry select committee, blamed \"gross overcapacity\" across the motor industry for the current problems and urged manufacturers to \"adopt a more realistic approach\" rather than \"lurch into crisis situations\". Mr O'Neill said: \"It's not the fault of the workers. It's the fault of the marketing people in the car industry who look at the world through rose-coloured glasses.\" Mr Byers said Ford's review of its operations had been motivated \"not by the strength of sterling, not by the employment laws in the UK, but as a result of over-production in the European market. \"Tomorrow's announcement will be a mixture of good and bad news. But what will be clear from it, is that Ford will remain committed to the UK and that we will still have Ford as a major employer within this country.\"",

This time it was Vatel, a Franco-British co-production directed by Roland Joff\u00e9, with an adapted screenplay by Tom Stoppard. Gerard Depardieu stars as Fran\u00e7ois Vatel, a 17th-century \"master of the revels\" reputed to have killed himself when the fish failed to arrive for an enormous three-day banquet-cum-spectacle he was directing for Louis XIV. </p> <p>The story's obvious possibilities for black comedy are ignored in favour of producing a flatulent and self-important costume drama. The film makes Vatel a smouldering hero and man of principle who gets to have sex with Uma Thurman, coolly despises the greedy and heartless courtiers, yet is bafflingly unconcerned by the fact that he is a key part of all this excess. Creaking under the weight of its expensive costumes and lavish set-pieces, Joff\u00e9's movie is paralysed within its single location, the Chantilly estate where it has been laboriously filmed. Ill-natured noblemen are always hissing unfortunate things like: \"The King is bored: eet ees a disastaire!\" </p> <p>Joff\u00e9 coaxes unhappy performances from all his stellar cast, but the king of wooden acting here is Depardieu, who lumbers about on auto-pilot, dealing with every horrendous crisis with the air of someone who has had to get out of the bath to answer the phone. A stable-boy is accidentally hanged by the rope-pulley mechanism which flies a cherub through the air for a masque, mounted for the smirking King's diversion. Vatel's noble disgust at this waste of a man's life is a very material factor at getting Uma into bed, yet it doesn't occur to her or anyone else to point out that it is really Gerard's fault. </p> <p>The screenplay, reworked from Jeanne Labrune's French original, dies an agonising death in almost every line. Tim Roth, playing a villainous courtier and wearing a wig that makes him look like an electrocuted poodle, has to say: \"Vinegar! It makes the King irritable - especially around his... anus .\" There are lots of very irritable-anus moments in this wretched script; its fundament is positively twitching when Depardieu has to say: \"Let me quote Descartes, who I knew...\" Stoppard has quite a few Hail Marys to say for this one. </p> <p>It looks worryingly as if Vatel, and last year's The Barber of Siberia by Nikita Mikhalkov, might be setting the trend for a kind of generic \"opening night\"-type film at Cannes: a film not submitted to the rigours of competition, plausibly grand - and so appropriate to kick off the festival - yet not too demanding. This year and last year the films have been squawking, gobbling turkeys and the festival must surely smarten up this important part of its act. </p> <p>That said, Vatel was not technically the first film to be shown here. It was preceded by a new 17-minute short by Jean-Luc Godard, De l'origine du XXIe si\u00e8cle, shot on video and punctuated with dates from the bygone century flashed up as captions - 1930, 1945, 1975, etc. Godard's film is a succession of harrowing and disorienting images, taken mostly from the theatre of political extremism - Nazism, Stalinism, hangings, and a particularly unlovely sequence showing someone urinating onto the face of a woman. What these add up to exactly is arguable: they possibly exhibit a glib or shallow sense of history, but something in the piece's very brevity and inscrutability gives it a certain power. It was definitely a more acceptable opening film for the first Cannes of the new century.</p>",

Statisticians say that if the current birth rate continues, by 2050 India will overtake China as the world's most populous country. 3. The world's population passed six billion on October 12 1999. At two minutes past midnight a baby boy in Bosnia was designated the world's six billionth person by United Nations secretary-general Kofi Annan. 4. India's government is using the birth of Astha Arora to highlight the problems caused by the nation's growing population and the need to control it. 5. Since independence in 1947, India's population has more than tripled - so has food production, but many people still go hungry. 6. Globally, population itself is not the problem: 30 years ago the world's food supply represented 2,360 calories per person; today that figure has increased to 2,740 calories and food supplies are expected to outstrip population growth for the next 10 years. 7. If the world was shrunk to 100 individuals (with all the existing human ratios the same) six people would own 59 per cent of the wealth and 50 would suffer from malnutrition. 8. As the world grows, it is feared that pressure on resources, such as water, in the poorest southern half of the world will lead to rising tensions within and between countries. 9. For now population control is a feminist issue. More and more women are becoming educated and entering the workforce, which means they delay starting a family and have fewer children. 10. The world is not growing uniformly. Unlike India, Japan and Italy are experiencing a decline in population.",

      "body": "<p>You can choose your friends, the saying goes, but you can't choose your relatives. That was before public records went online and you could put your name into a search engine and call up whole pages of distant cousins, planning a holiday around the better-located of them. Genealogy has always been popular with bearded men who enjoy reading charts. But the transference of the social security index on to the web has seen a more general rise in enthusiasm for tracing ancestors who fought in the civil war or went down with the Titanic, preferably with a descendant in Bali. </p> <p>Most family historians are compelled by two things: one, to construct a narrative for themselves that is more interesting than the one they've got; two, to identify in the family tree a strain of talent they might claim heir to, if only at molecular level. </p> <p>\"I had a client who was convinced she was descended from Johann Sebastian Bach,\" says Eric Probert, genealogical consultant and computer editor of Family Tree magazine. \"But I traced her records back and she came from a family of Backs in the Midlands. She wouldn't accept it, though. She died still believing she was related to Bach.\" </p> <p>Her suspension of disbelief is in keeping with the slightly fantastical nature of the pur suit. Several years ago, I typed my mum's maiden name - De Kiewiet - into a US search engine. It returned one name, Mark De Kiewiet, with an email address in Oregon. We calculated that our grand-parents had been first cousins and he sent me a family tree going back eight generations. Then, one night, I wobbled in from the pub to a ringing phone and there he was, calling from the US, threatening to drop by on a forthcoming trip to London. I recoiled. Mark only existed for me as a repository for the faith that I was connected to something distant and exotic. I didn't want him on my doorstep acting like a mortal or, more probably, a nutter. My mum was exasperated. We have enough weird relatives, she said, without digging up more. </p> <p>Tracing dead ancestors doesn't present this problem, but it does come from the same slightly desperate drive to retrieve for oneself a secret history, a refuge from the fear of being ordinary. It is a motivation well known to the makers of family tree web sites and CD-Rom packages. The underlying sell is: bad day at work? Raise your chin, soldier, for you are descended from the Warrior King of Bohemia and his third wife, Ethel (you and everyone else who cares to look). </p> <p>If you're not too worried about the facts, it's an easy trick to pull off. You go to a web site such as <a href=\"http://www.familysearch.org\">www.familysearch.org</a>. With access to 600m names, it's one of the biggest genealogy sites in Britain and run, like most of them, by the Mormon Church. (The Mormons are the chief distributors of genealogical data, since it's their aim to find Mormon ancestors and rebaptise them into the church.) Anyway, you go to the site, enter a surname, and with any luck a whole raft of spicy ancestors will pop up. </p> <p>Within an hour of logging onto the Family Search website, I have found a possible branch of my dad's family in Czechoslovakia (a marriage certificate exists for Dorothy Brockes and Johan Lebeda in Litomysl, 1723), a lead on the maternal grandmother front (a christening record for a Michiel Doubel, Cape of Good Hope, 1869) and - yes! - a celebrity. I am related to none other than radical theorist and social revolutionary, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, a fact established by feeding each new surname back into the search engine. Grandma Doubel's mother was (possibly) Rosa Erasmus, whose mother was Rosa Rossouw, whose alternative spelling was Rousseau. Bingo. </p> <p>This is the kind of blind, acquisitive research that infuriates professional genealogists. \"You've got to work back from yourself, stage by stage,\" says Christine Morris, who has traced her own family back to the 16th century. \"You can't just appropriate a name you find in the middle of America and assume you are related to them.\" </p> <p>\"The internet has made it easier,\" says Eric Probert. \"But you always need to go back to the original source - the parish register, for example - because there may be mistakes in the translation.\" Probert has traced his own roots back to an 18th-century stone mason in Herefordshire - William Probert - where he has been stuck for 15 years. \"I can't find his baptism or death certificate,\" he sighs. </p> <p>\"A lot of people don't take up genealogy until they retire,\" says Michael Armstrong, who founded Family Tree magazine in 1985 and has seen it grow to a circulation of 42,000. In a recent poll of 500 of its subscribers, the majority were found to be in the 50-59 age group. Only six were under the age of 29, and while nearly 300 respondents had a computer, only eight had ever found a family connection via the internet. </p> <p>The new generation of family historians differs considerably in their methods and motivations from their older counterparts. \"A lot of people get into genealogy now, not through their interest in family history, but through their interest in computers,\" says Armstrong. \"They are a different type of people.\" </p> <p>In other words, they are the dilettantes whose first resource is the free, online databases that stop 100 years short of the present day and are useless unless you have done some primary research to cover the gap. For this, the dedicated computer user can turn to more comprehensive packages such as the Genera tions Family Tree Grande Suite, a set of 15 CD-Roms boasting access to more than a billion names. It's linked to the <a href=\"http://www.ancestory.com\">www.ancestory.com</a> website and is heavily tailored for the American market (US states are listed separately, while Europe appears as a conglomerate). </p> <p>Its big selling point is its databases, including Civil War muster rolls for five million soldiers, national archives for both world wars and the Titanic passenger list, an indication that there is nothing a user likes better than to imagine himself at the scene of a disaster, or at least, its film version. </p> <p>The problem with using a package like this as a first resource is that unless you are lucky with your surname you'll fall into one of two camps. De Kiewiet returns no names; Heaney, my paternal grandmother's name, returns 1,115. At several turns, the program suggests I might like to buy the 1870 Maryland census for $295, or the International Directory of Brockes in Salt Lake City, which at $39.99 is a series of maps and charts locating everyone of that surname in the entire world and strikes me as a bit creepy. The other service is the virtual photo album, where you can turn all your findings into an Ancestry World Tree, with pop-up boxes, a mottled background and the swirly typefaces that characterise the set. </p> <p>A more sensible first stop is something like the World Family Tree, a resource of 143,000 privately researched histories and 98 million names. That allows you, before embarking on your search, to ensure that you're not going over the same ground an unknown cousin in Ontario spent five years on. The average family tree contains 600 names and although you can't download the results without paying \u00a310, it does mean you can find out if you're listed before buying the \u00a360 CD-Rom. </p> <p>This is known as 'shareware' software, a program that allows you to download a free version before you commit to buying. It's what Wayne Younge relied on to trace his family tree back seven generations. Two years ago, Younge, a lecturer at City University in London, took a trip to Barbados, where his parents were from, and started researching his family tree. His first resource was human - talking to as many old people as possible. His next was paper - going to the archives and trying to consolidate what he had been told. It was only after this that Younge turned to the web. </p> <p>\"I posted a message on the West Indian newsgroups, asking if anyone had information on a list of surnames,\" he says. Younge downloaded two free applications - from <a href=\"http://www.brotherskeeper.com\">www.brotherskeeper.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.gendex.com\">www.gendex.com</a> - which allowed him to save his findings in a clickable family tree. Thus armed, he went to FamilySearch.org and was able to eliminate the dozens of Younges who bore no relation to him. </p> <p>\"On sites such as Family Search, most of the information is at least 100 years old and to get back that far, the best sources of information are archives or family members. Where the internet makes a huge difference is in sharing information.

      "bodyText": "William Hague's spin doctors were understandably keen to share what they judged to be the good news. There has not been an abundance of it since he emerged from John Major's election catastrophe three years ago. Few commentators believe the Tories have a remote chance of winning the general election expected next year. Mr Hague must keep his troops' morale up, ward off threats to his leadership after election day, and find issues that work - ''tunes people can whistle.'' So at Wednesday night's meeting of the shadow cabinet the Conservative leader was able to tell his colleagues that his headline-grabbing tactics before the local election results had paid off, despite uproar in some sections of the media and the byelection defeat in Romsey, hitherto a Tory stronghold. If it is more significant than just another twitch on a flatlining monitor of the Tory Party's health, then the Hagueites will claim their young leader has finally struck that elusive chord with voters on law and order (for instance, condemning Tony Martin's conviction for murdering a burglar) and calls for a tighter line of asylum. Labour has been ahead even on law and order in the Blair era. But according to private poll findings for the party, conducted among 1,000 voters last weekend by ICM, the gap between Tories and Labour shrank to 8% - the lowest it has been since sterling fell out of the exchange rate mechanism in 1992. ''This is the end of flatlining,'' Mr Hague, told fellow-MPs, a reference to the depressing fact that ICM has found Tory support stuck between 27% and 32% since the election save for the occasional, brief twitch. The Tories have risen by 3% to 35% since April, Labour has fallen to 42% while the Lib Dems remain steady on 15%. Smaller parties are on around 8%. Never to trust selective leaking of private polls is good advice. The ICM team has not yet confirmed the trend, if that is what it is, in its public findings for the Guardian.

Firefighters admitted they had been forced to retreat in the face of high winds and a water shortage.</p> <p>At least 18,000 people were evacuated from the city this morning, including 7,000 in the White Rock suburb. No injuries were reported, but President Bill Clinton declared New Mexico a major disaster area.</p> <p>Flames reached a Los Alamos national laboratory building, but it did not ignite. The laboratory has been shut down and officials stressed that explosives and radioactive material were protected in fireproof facilities.</p> <p>\"We can assure the country and New Mexico that our nuclear materials are safe,\" said the energy secretary, Bill Richardson, a former New Mexico congressman.</p> <p>Flying embers have set off spot-fires in the grounds of the laboratory, but officials said plutonium and high explosives were securely sealed in concrete and steel bunkers.</p> <p>\"Of all the things that could threaten the nuclear material, a forest fire is very low on the list of threats,\" fire information centre spokesman Chris Judson said.</p> <p>The fire was started by the national park service a week ago to clear brush, but it quickly flared out of control, racing through stands of ponderosa pine across a 4,500-acre area. Winds gusted to 50 mph yesterday - and forecasters said there was a danger that they might increase today and fan the blaze.</p> <p>Los Alamos, which is 70 miles north of Albuquerque, is a company town for the federal lab. In the 1940s it was used as the operations base for the Manhattan Project, which built the first atomic bomb.</p> <p>Residents of the community began to flee as winds rose yesterday, hurling flames into tinder-dry, tree-filled residential areas. Police, sheriff's and fire department officials visited each of the 6,000 households in Los Alamos in an effort to evacuate the town.</p> <p>\"We are in a retreat situation,\" said county firefighting spokesman Bill Lehman last night.

      "bodyText": "A raging fire swept through the abandoned streets of Los Alamos, New Mexico today, burning at least 100 homes and \"singeing\" the biggest nuclear weapons laboratory in the US. Firefighters admitted they had been forced to retreat in the face of high winds and a water shortage. At least 18,000 people were evacuated from the city this morning, including 7,000 in the White Rock suburb. No injuries were reported, but President Bill Clinton declared New Mexico a major disaster area. Flames reached a Los Alamos national laboratory building, but it did not ignite. The laboratory has been shut down and officials stressed that explosives and radioactive material were protected in fireproof facilities. \"We can assure the country and New Mexico that our nuclear materials are safe,\" said the energy secretary, Bill Richardson, a former New Mexico congressman. Flying embers have set off spot-fires in the grounds of the laboratory, but officials said plutonium and high explosives were securely sealed in concrete and steel bunkers. \"Of all the things that could threaten the nuclear material, a forest fire is very low on the list of threats,\" fire information centre spokesman Chris Judson said. The fire was started by the national park service a week ago to clear brush, but it quickly flared out of control, racing through stands of ponderosa pine across a 4,500-acre area. Winds gusted to 50 mph yesterday - and forecasters said there was a danger that they might increase today and fan the blaze. Los Alamos, which is 70 miles north of Albuquerque, is a company town for the federal lab. In the 1940s it was used as the operations base for the Manhattan Project, which built the first atomic bomb. Residents of the community began to flee as winds rose yesterday, hurling flames into tinder-dry, tree-filled residential areas. Police, sheriff's and fire department officials visited each of the 6,000 households in Los Alamos in an effort to evacuate the town. \"We are in a retreat situation,\" said county firefighting spokesman Bill Lehman last night. The fire was too dangerous to battle head-on, and firefighters were even forced to move their command post. This fire's got a mind of its own,\" he said. Firefighters were reluctant to back off, but \"there was just nothing we could do, because of the wind.\" Water-dropping helicopters and aeroplanes dropping pink fire retardant bombarded the blaze, hoping to narrow its westward and northward thrust. The Los Alamos laboratory declared a general emergency yesterday, saying there were grass and brush fires at three of its research facilities.

But, instead, he chooses to catch you in an arm lock, twist you about a bit, kick you up the arse (sorry, assss), throw you down the stairs. GET OUTTA HERE! (Ah, his Saturday Night Live self). </p> <p>It's a standard Martin gag. Once upon a time (1976), it would have been for real. But now, there's a line of nodding-dog publicists behind Martin, laughing fakely at the hollow horseplay. </p> <p>Martin is the perfect example of why comedians should never go into the movies. Somewhere along the line - let's call it the moment they read a script - they stop being funny. </p> <p>In one way, it's nothing to do with the performer at all, but simply the structure, sorry stricture, of movie-making. Martin's entire film career is an inevitable glacial slide towards schmaltz-mediocrity. It's as if, movie by movie, Hollywood has ground the talent out of the man, ending up with a husk of the original genius, but a perfect Hollywood machine-actor. </p> <p>Exactly the same thing happened to Eddie Murphy. But it wasn't always so. The Three Stooges inhabited their own comedic world on the big screen. (Martin has always namechecked The Three Stooges) - so, too, Abbott and Costello. When did it go wrong? When another Martin - Dean Martin - was teamed with Jerry Lewis. Hollywood had everything covered with this krazy komedy dream-team: we get the wild guy stuff from the little Jewish one, and the ladies swooning over the tall dark cardboard guy. </p> <p>It was the beginning of formula comedy. And the beginning of the end for anything resembling originality, spark or danger on the big screen. From the mid-50s onwards, the strait-jacket of the story (boy-girl-conflict-resolution) mattered far more than any wise-cracking shyster the studio might hire to play in it. </p> <p>Steve Martin's debut big screen outings - The Jerk, Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid and The Man With Two Brains - demonstrate how ill at ease Martin was with movies. They each subvert the crass stupidity of the format film. They're basically a laugh at the expense of the medium in which Martin had suddenly been plonked. </p> <p>As time went on, and the movies rolled by, Martin got sucked into the system, and started to become the sort of person he would have ripped the shit out of at the beginning of his career. Martin's capitulation of his talent was a victory for Hollywood, proving they could tame the wildest beast. </p> <p>There's a darker side to the movies Martin produced as his creativity sunk from view: LA Story, Parenthood, House Sitter, Father Of The Bride. Each is a progressively more twisted take on the white neurotic middle-aged male. There's comedy in there somewhere, but you'd be hard pressed to find it amid all the snarling, suppressed anger. </p> <p>There's another unpalatable side to Martin's act: his pass-the-sick-bag sincerity, always disconcertingly the wrong side of parody. Martin shares the heart-on-sleeve approach of his contemporary, Andy Kaufman, who could never reconcile himself to the system. Martin could, because he was basically Kaufman with a business plan. Bottom line, Martin was always a strange and dislikeble man. Hollywood gave him a chance to escape his comic genius and live out his real life weirdness in straight roles. </p> <p>Watching Martin do Wild Man physical comedy now is like watching a fat fortysomething John Lydon say: \"I Am The Anti-Christ.\" It lacks that ring of authenticity. It's a self-abasing comment on how far he's moved away from his original self, and perhaps how little that original self meant anyway. </p> <p>So why does Martin want to return to TV, signing a three-year deal with Carsey-Werner, home of NBC's Third Rock From The Sun? </p> <p>Because American TV comedy has rediscovered its Martinesque roots: Third Rock is pure Martin circa Saturday Night Live. There's an appetite once more for the kind of comedy that Martin, John Belushi, Dan Ackroyd and Bill Murray pioneered in the mid-70s (Seinfeld's Kramer was an SNL steal, plain and simple). </p> <p>More importantly, there's an acknowledgement that TV is a more open, radical environment for comedy than the big screen could ever be. Comedians are turned into heroes on the big screen, and it just doesn't fit. </p> <p>But since Martin's heyday, TV comedy has been revolutionised. And if shows like South Park are as big and mainstream now as Johnny Carson was in the 60s, then how is Martin going to play it? Funny ha, ha or funny peculiar? Or maybe just not funny at all.</p>",

Bottom line, Martin was always a strange and dislikeble man. Hollywood gave him a chance to escape his comic genius and live out his real life weirdness in straight roles. Watching Martin do Wild Man physical comedy now is like watching a fat fortysomething John Lydon say: \"I Am The Anti-Christ.\" It lacks that ring of authenticity. It's a self-abasing comment on how far he's moved away from his original self, and perhaps how little that original self meant anyway. So why does Martin want to return to TV, signing a three-year deal with Carsey-Werner, home of NBC's Third Rock From The Sun? Because American TV comedy has rediscovered its Martinesque roots: Third Rock is pure Martin circa Saturday Night Live. There's an appetite once more for the kind of comedy that Martin, John Belushi, Dan Ackroyd and Bill Murray pioneered in the mid-70s (Seinfeld's Kramer was an SNL steal, plain and simple). More importantly, there's an acknowledgement that TV is a more open, radical environment for comedy than the big screen could ever be. Comedians are turned into heroes on the big screen, and it just doesn't fit. But since Martin's heyday, TV comedy has been revolutionised. And if shows like South Park are as big and mainstream now as Johnny Carson was in the 60s, then how is Martin going to play it? Funny ha, ha or funny peculiar? Or maybe just not funny at all.",

But that's all changed. Nowadays, internet-savvy cinephiles can log on to web sites devoted to a film that may be months away from completion, conduct Q&amp;As with directors and actors while they are still shooting, check out unauthorised photos and reports from on-set spies, and debate online with fellow fans the minutiae of casting and locations. </p> <p>Even the studios are getting in on the act. The Lord of the Rings (LOTR) is currently being filmed in New Zealand as a trilogy of two-hour films, a mammoth 18-month shoot from which the first film won't even be released until Christmas 2001. Despite this, the films' official web site is already up and running, and a few weeks ago a few minutes of very rough \"preview\" footage was put up on the web. The site had more than 1.7 million downloads of the footage in the first 24 hours - not bad for a trilogy of films whose debut is still 18 months away, and the last of which won't be out for another three and a half years. </p> <p>The recent LOTR preview was the first time that a major Hollywood studio has released footage of a film that is still 12 months away from even finishing its shoot, let alone releasing a trailer. If you had spent $200m on a very long strip of celluloid still light years from making a return, you'd want to protect your investment too. This explains why the film studios are so keen on interactive web sites at the moment: it's a way of getting an audience before you even have your film in the can. An increasing chunk of a film's marketing budget is spent online, not necessarily on adverts, but in using the film's official web site as part of the film itself. </p> <p>For the release of <a href=\"http://www.scream3.com\">Scream 3</a>, the web site was a mock-up of the web site for Stab 2 - the film based on the original film (still with me?).

      "body": "<p><strong> Delivery suite</strong><br> The proliferation of online shopping has brought with it inevitable complaints of concealed costs and delivery problems. But plenty of conventional mail-order companies are still giving hi-tech outfits a run for their money when it comes to shoddy service. </p> <p>MA Godfrey of Leeds, Terry Duffy of St Helens, S Cann of Doncaster and Renata Harvey of Cornwall are all waiting for goods they ordered months ago from Home Selections, part of a company called Temps L, which is based in Sittingbourne. Duffy's experience was typical. On ringing to inquire about his order, he was informed that he was 26th in the queue. When an operator finally answered, Duffy was transferred straight back to the automated answer service. \"I was instructed to press option two, was treated to a Latin mass, overtures from most of the world's musicals and finally another operator, who did the same as the first and so on,\" he says. Duffy's next phone bill showed the call had cost \u00a321. \"This means I have spent an extra \u00a321 trying to buy an item worth \u00a348,\" he says. </p> <p>\u0095 \"We're sorry, all our lines are busy. Please try again,\" intones a recorded message each time Consumer tries to ring Temps L. In desperation, we appeal to Kent Trading Standards, which admits that it has received a number of complaints from empty-handed customers. </p> <p>\"We have had meetings with the company to try to sort out their problems, but we don't see them as a problem company,\" says a spokesman. The difficulty seems to be an over-zealous advertising campaign which attracted an unexpected multitude of orders. \"They are having problems meeting demand, the warehouse is not fully staffed and there were not enough people to answer the phones,\" says Trading Standards. \"They are recruiting new people but it all might take some time because they seem to have lost a lot of customers' details.\" Those still waiting are advised to write to the company detailing their order. Two months after the first attempt, Consumer has a last shot at reaching the firm. \"I'm sorry,\" says the familiar voice, \"all our lines are busy...\" </p> <p><strong> Musical jeers</strong><br> Several readers feel they have been suffering at the hands of book and music clubs, the kind that offer you the complete works of Jane Austen for \u00a31.99 provided you buy a full-price book each quarter for the next two years. They are enticing to join but not, it seems, so easy to leave. </p> <p>Britannia Music Club, which sells discounted CDs to its members, obliges them to buy a recommended recording each month unless they write to refuse each dispatch. When Evelyn Mann of Clacton-on-Sea tried to cancel her membership, having fulfilled all her requirements, she was told that the recommended recording could not be cancelled on a permanent basis. This meant she faced having to write to refuse it every month ad infinitum. Philip Freeman of Wolverhampton says he can't break free of Britannia either because, he says, \"they've disqualified all but one of my purchases from their required six regular CDs in two years, on the grounds that they were not 'regular', although a search of their monthly catalogues failed to disclose any alternative descriptions for them\". </p> <p>\u0095 Britannia says Mann's account was cancelled as requested but the wrong letter was sent. Someone has now rung her to apologise. As for Freeman, the club says some offers are heavily discounted and are therefore excluded from members' required quota of purchases. \"These prices and conditions are highlighted in special sales information provided at the time of mailing.\" </p> <p><strong> Cold comfort</strong><br> Won't-take-no-for-an-answer cold calls from salesmen, so often featured on this page, have been exercising Michael Grosvenor Myer of Cambridge. \"People are too polite to these nuisances,\" he says. \"My own technique with them is simply to put the phone down on them as soon as they have identified themselves as being Wobbly Windows or Krumbly Kitchens with 'a wonderful piece of news you'.\" </p> <p>My tip, for those feeling sorely vengeful, is to ask said salesman to hang on while you turn the hob down or answer the doorbell. Then don't return. The joy of this method lies in calculating the phone bill - and man hours - the company is wasting as it hovers for your custom. If anyone has other advice, please share it. </p> <p> <strong> Dead letters</strong><br> Last week we discovered why so much junk mail addressed to either the long dead or the long since moved clogs our doorsteps. The owner of a small mail order firm had written in complaining that the address list he'd purchased via a broker was fearsomely out of date, a fact he only realised after receiving 3,000 of his mail shots \"returned to sender\". </p> <p>Now D Kelly of Leeds has received an offer of tampons addressed to her 90-year-old grandmother. Not only did her grandmother die last year, but she had never lived at the Leeds address. Ian McRobert of Peterborough is not surprised. \"I'm a postman and can tell you that even reputable firms use rubbish mailing lists,\" he says. \"One this morning had 25% of its names wrong and one earlier this week had addressees who'd died years ago. It's unlikely that the mailing list people would even know when someone had died as the Royal Mail no longer returns mail marked 'deceased', merely 'gone away'.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile the Royal Mail writes to say it has launched a booklet to tell householders how to avoid junk mail. Requests addressed to Freepost, Fair Play will, apparently, suffice. </p> <p><strong> Off the hook</strong><br> In January 1996 Suzanne Williams of Gwynedd both wrote and telephoned Vodafone to cancel her contract with the necessary 28 days' notice. Weeks later an invoice arrived for February line rental and, when she queried it, Vodafone denied having received the cancellation. Williams claims numerous letters from her since then have gone unanswered, including two sent recorded delivery this year, and her case is now in the hands of a debt collection agency. </p> <p> \u0095 Vodafone maintains it never saw or heard the cancellation notices but promises Consumer it will drop its demands and restore Williams' credit status.</p> <p><strong> Net loss</strong><br> It seems cruel to attack lastminute.com when it is still reeling from the recent stock market blip, but Jane Creaton of London feels some flak is justified. She booked a hotel room through the website then found it available elsewhere for \u00a320 less. The sales blurb promised customers they would be refunded the difference if they found a cheaper alternative, so Creaton emailed... and emailed, and emailed. Five messages in all over two months and not a single reply. Two phone calls were no more successful due, says Creaton, to \"their spectacularly unhelpful sales assistants\". </p> <p>\u0095 Lastminute.com's eager new PR firm is far more forthcoming. \"Due to a small administrative oversight, we regret that Ms Creaton's emails were directed to an incorrect mailbox,\" says a spokesman. \"She has now accepted our apology and the \u00a320 she is owed, plus a goodwill voucher.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Write to us at119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER, send a fax on 020-7239 9933 or email us at <a href=\"'mailto:consumer@theguardian.com'\">consumer@theguardian.com </a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Delivery suite The proliferation of online shopping has brought with it inevitable complaints of concealed costs and delivery problems. But plenty of conventional mail-order companies are still giving hi-tech outfits a run for their money when it comes to shoddy service. MA Godfrey of Leeds, Terry Duffy of St Helens, S Cann of Doncaster and Renata Harvey of Cornwall are all waiting for goods they ordered months ago from Home Selections, part of a company called Temps L, which is based in Sittingbourne. Duffy's experience was typical. On ringing to inquire about his order, he was informed that he was 26th in the queue. When an operator finally answered, Duffy was transferred straight back to the automated answer service. \"I was instructed to press option two, was treated to a Latin mass, overtures from most of the world's musicals and finally another operator, who did the same as the first and so on,\" he says. Duffy's next phone bill showed the call had cost \u00a321. \"This means I have spent an extra \u00a321 trying to buy an item worth \u00a348,\" he says. \u0095 \"We're sorry, all our lines are busy. Please try again,\" intones a recorded message each time Consumer tries to ring Temps L. In desperation, we appeal to Kent Trading Standards, which admits that it has received a number of complaints from empty-handed customers. \"We have had meetings with the company to try to sort out their problems, but we don't see them as a problem company,\" says a spokesman. The difficulty seems to be an over-zealous advertising campaign which attracted an unexpected multitude of orders. \"They are having problems meeting demand, the warehouse is not fully staffed and there were not enough people to answer the phones,\" says Trading Standards. \"They are recruiting new people but it all might take some time because they seem to have lost a lot of customers' details.\" Those still waiting are advised to write to the company detailing their order. Two months after the first attempt, Consumer has a last shot at reaching the firm. \"I'm sorry,\" says the familiar voice, \"all our lines are busy...\" Musical jeers Several readers feel they have been suffering at the hands of book and music clubs, the kind that offer you the complete works of Jane Austen for \u00a31.99 provided you buy a full-price book each quarter for the next two years. They are enticing to join but not, it seems, so easy to leave. Britannia Music Club, which sells discounted CDs to its members, obliges them to buy a recommended recording each month unless they write to refuse each dispatch. When Evelyn Mann of Clacton-on-Sea tried to cancel her membership, having fulfilled all her requirements, she was told that the recommended recording could not be cancelled on a permanent basis. This meant she faced having to write to refuse it every month ad infinitum. Philip Freeman of Wolverhampton says he can't break free of Britannia either because, he says, \"they've disqualified all but one of my purchases from their required six regular CDs in two years, on the grounds that they were not 'regular', although a search of their monthly catalogues failed to disclose any alternative descriptions for them\". \u0095 Britannia says Mann's account was cancelled as requested but the wrong letter was sent. Someone has now rung her to apologise. As for Freeman, the club says some offers are heavily discounted and are therefore excluded from members' required quota of purchases. \"These prices and conditions are highlighted in special sales information provided at the time of mailing.\" Cold comfort Won't-take-no-for-an-answer cold calls from salesmen, so often featured on this page, have been exercising Michael Grosvenor Myer of Cambridge. \"People are too polite to these nuisances,\" he says. \"My own technique with them is simply to put the phone down on them as soon as they have identified themselves as being Wobbly Windows or Krumbly Kitchens with 'a wonderful piece of news you'.\" My tip, for those feeling sorely vengeful, is to ask said salesman to hang on while you turn the hob down or answer the doorbell. Then don't return. The joy of this method lies in calculating the phone bill - and man hours - the company is wasting as it hovers for your custom. If anyone has other advice, please share it. Dead letters Last week we discovered why so much junk mail addressed to either the long dead or the long since moved clogs our doorsteps. The owner of a small mail order firm had written in complaining that the address list he'd purchased via a broker was fearsomely out of date, a fact he only realised after receiving 3,000 of his mail shots \"returned to sender\". Now D Kelly of Leeds has received an offer of tampons addressed to her 90-year-old grandmother. Not only did her grandmother die last year, but she had never lived at the Leeds address. Ian McRobert of Peterborough is not surprised. \"I'm a postman and can tell you that even reputable firms use rubbish mailing lists,\" he says. \"One this morning had 25% of its names wrong and one earlier this week had addressees who'd died years ago. It's unlikely that the mailing list people would even know when someone had died as the Royal Mail no longer returns mail marked 'deceased', merely 'gone away'.\" Meanwhile the Royal Mail writes to say it has launched a booklet to tell householders how to avoid junk mail. Requests addressed to Freepost, Fair Play will, apparently, suffice. Off the hook In January 1996 Suzanne Williams of Gwynedd both wrote and telephoned Vodafone to cancel her contract with the necessary 28 days' notice. Weeks later an invoice arrived for February line rental and, when she queried it, Vodafone denied having received the cancellation. Williams claims numerous letters from her since then have gone unanswered, including two sent recorded delivery this year, and her case is now in the hands of a debt collection agency. \u0095 Vodafone maintains it never saw or heard the cancellation notices but promises Consumer it will drop its demands and restore Williams' credit status. Net loss It seems cruel to attack lastminute.com when it is still reeling from the recent stock market blip, but Jane Creaton of London feels some flak is justified. She booked a hotel room through the website then found it available elsewhere for \u00a320 less. The sales blurb promised customers they would be refunded the difference if they found a cheaper alternative, so Creaton emailed... and emailed, and emailed. Five messages in all over two months and not a single reply. Two phone calls were no more successful due, says Creaton, to \"their spectacularly unhelpful sales assistants\". \u0095 Lastminute.com's eager new PR firm is far more forthcoming. \"Due to a small administrative oversight, we regret that Ms Creaton's emails were directed to an incorrect mailbox,\" says a spokesman. \"She has now accepted our apology and the \u00a320 she is owed, plus a goodwill voucher.\" \u0095 Write to us at119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER, send a fax on 020-7239 9933 or email us at consumer@theguardian.com",

After the meeting, during which some \"very hot\" unionist speeches were made arguing for the removal of Sinn Fein and Roman Catholics from the shipyards, bodies of men carrying sticks and clubs descended on Harland and Wolff - the site of the third most important centre for shipbuilding in the British empire. A police report at the time described the subsequent violence as a \"general hunt\" for Catholic workers, some of whom were severely beaten and were thrown into the water, having to swim for their lives. Thus began, in the middle of the IRA's war against British rule and the establishment of a separate northern/unionist state, the mass expulsion of Catholic workers from the shipyard, which built the \"unsinkable\" Titanic that sunk in 1912. The expulsion of thousands of Catholic workers left a deep psychological scar on northern nationalists. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that when news broke in April 2000 that the shipyard was on the verge of closure, there was a certain amount of schadenfreude within the city's republican community. Nationalists point to the fact that the yard's workforce continued to provide the shock troops for loyalist street protest right up until the 1980s. During the 1974 Ulster workers' strike, which brought down the last power-sharing government in Northern Ireland, the shipyard was closed thanks to a combination of outright intimidation and loyalist militancy among the stagers who built the scaffolding around ships under construction. But the delight shared by republicans over the shipyard's uncertain future is short-sighted, because the loss of shipbuilding will have a negative effect on the entire economy in Northern Ireland. Today the area around Harland and Wolff represents the old and the new Belfast.

The Greens and Popular party want to stop a gruesome murder scene from the sequel to The Silence of the Lambs being filmed inside the Palazzo Vecchio, a renaissance monument to good taste. The giddiness that surrounded the arrival of the actor Anthony Hopkins, who will portray Lecter, and director Ridley Scott has turned to concern that tourists who see the film may never again look at Florence the same way. In an open letter to the mayor, Leonardo Domenici, the two parties begged him to retract the authorisation for the three-day shooting of the sequel, called Hannibal. \"This will add nothing to Florence's prestige in the world,\" they said in the letter. \"We believe instead that the most intimate location in the city would become the setting for morbid thrills and vulgar horror.\" Although the parties are members of the city's ruling centre-left coalition, it was thought unlikely the mayor will oblige. Nevertheless, the Florence newspaper, La Nazione, has queried the value of transforming the city's image from sun-kissed culture and civilisation to that of blood and cannibalism. Thomas Harris, whose best-seller spawned the Oscar-winning Silence of the Lambs, was inspired to base his sequel in the Tuscan capital by a 1992 visit. He attended the trial of the so-called monster of Florence, Pietro Pacciani, who was accused of killing eight courting couples in the woods in and around Florence between 1968 and 1985. However, one of the investigators suspected that Pacciani was too stupid to have arranged the killings and may have been following the orders of a respected local professional, a notion that is said to have intrigued Harris. The farm labourer was acquitted on appeal but faced another trial until he died of a heart attack in 1998. In the new film, Hannibal flees an American hospital for the criminally insane and reinvents himself as the cultured, Dante-quoting custodian of the Capponi library, after brutally creating a vacancy. He is tracked down by a mutilated former victim, played by Gary Oldman, and FBI agent Clarice Starling, played this time by Julianne Moore instead of Jodie Foster. Mayhem ensues.

He resigned the captaincy following a whitewash against the Black Caps, having lost both Tests and all five one-day internationals. </p> <p>A week later he announced he would \"use the time away to seek the assistance of appropriate professionals to rebuild all facets of my games so as to sustain the remainder of my cricketing career\".</p> <p>Former West Indies team manager Clive Lloyd said: \"It is a shame that a man with so much talent is not taking part in the game he loves. </p> <p>\"I am really saddened by that. I thought the little break he had would have been the sort of rest he needed to come back and show his talents.\" </p> <p>Asked on Radio 4 if Lara was dismayed at the Windies' demise after years of dominating the game, Lloyd said: \"Brian perhaps got a bit disillusioned because the young talent was not coming through quickly and the team were not doing well. </p> <p>\"I don't think anyone had any indication that he wanted to give it up. I would love to see Lara back playing again - he is poetry in motion in full flow. </p> <p>\"He got on well with his players; there was never a particular problem there. He sets such high standards and if you don't meet them he feels disappointed. </p> <p>\"Brian is a lovely young man but at the moment he can't come to grips with things.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Brian Lara has pulled out of the West Indies squad to tour England this summer, according to a report in the Independent. The former Windies skipper is reported to have told his country's selectors he wants to extend his exile from the international arena on Tuesday. The 31-year-old left-hander's self-imposed break from the game - he missed the home series with Zimbabwe and Pakistan - had been expected to come to an end in time for the tour, which starts in three weeks' time. Lara, who underwent psychic counselling, had been told not to return to the Test arena until he felt the motivation to do so. The rest from the game was taken after Lara's side's disastrous display in New Zealand. He resigned the captaincy following a whitewash against the Black Caps, having lost both Tests and all five one-day internationals. A week later he announced he would \"use the time away to seek the assistance of appropriate professionals to rebuild all facets of my games so as to sustain the remainder of my cricketing career\". Former West Indies team manager Clive Lloyd said: \"It is a shame that a man with so much talent is not taking part in the game he loves. \"I am really saddened by that. I thought the little break he had would have been the sort of rest he needed to come back and show his talents.\" Asked on Radio 4 if Lara was dismayed at the Windies' demise after years of dominating the game, Lloyd said: \"Brian perhaps got a bit disillusioned because the young talent was not coming through quickly and the team were not doing well. \"I don't think anyone had any indication that he wanted to give it up. I would love to see Lara back playing again - he is poetry in motion in full flow. \"He got on well with his players; there was never a particular problem there. He sets such high standards and if you don't meet them he feels disappointed. \"Brian is a lovely young man but at the moment he can't come to grips with things.\"",

      "body": "<p>When I go back to the core of my childhood, my cousin Lucy seems always to be in the peripheral vision of my memories. She is off to one side, always off to one side, with a book, with a scheme or a project or an enterprise. Or with an animal. I keep thinking that if I could only shift my head an inch and change its angle, then I would see her fully. Just as Marian, her sister, a year my senior, was magnified in my mind, so Lucy, two and a half years younger, was additionally reduced. Only their brother David did I see four-square... In my clearest image of her she is crossing the small courtyard between the stable and the house, looking downwards and smiling secretively, privately, as if sharing a joke with the mouse I knew she had in her pocket. Some people, alas, live and die without trace. They come and they go and they leave no trace. This, at least, was not Lucy's destiny.</p> <p>On the night of December 27 1973, Lucy Partington, who was staying with her mother in Gloucestershire, was driven into Cheltenham to visit an old friend, Helen Render. Lucy and Helen spent the evening talking about their future; they put together a letter of application to the Courtauld Institute in London, where Lucy hoped to continue studying medieval art. They parted at 10.15. It was a three-minute walk to the bus stop. She never posted the letter and she never boarded the bus. She was 21. And it was another 21 years before the world found out what happened to her.</p> <p>At certain times, for certain periods, David was able to persuade himself that Lucy was still alive - alive, but elsewhere. Naturally all the Partingtons attempted something of the kind. My mother, too, attempted it. I attempted it. Lucy was serious, resolute, artistic, musical and religious. Even when we were children, the message I always took away from Lucy was that she wasn't going to be deflected, she wasn't going to be deterred.</p> <p>Only with difficulty could you imagine her having the inclination to vanish; but it was the work of a moment to imagine her having the will. So she was in a nunnery, somewhere; she was a violinist in Melbourne, a pseudonymous poet in Montreal. Of course, these reveries kept running up against an obstacle: the fact that Lucy was gentle, was kind, was sane. To which the one available rejoinder would be: well, I must have been wrong about that, and I suppose it can deeply surprise you, the people who turn out to be prepared to disseminate hurt. Thus the argument continued (very faintly after a while, and then almost inaudibly, given my distance from the event) for 21 years.</p> <p>In early March 1994, I had been abroad and knew nothing until I opened a newspaper in the taxi from Heathrow. There was the photograph I had last seen on a missing persons poster 20 years ago. David would later tell me that the moment he heard about the exhumations in Gloucester, he knew that Lucy would be among the dead.</p> <p>She had been abducted by one of the most prolific murderers in British history, Frederick West. We knew what had happened to her after death. She was decapitated and dismembered, and her remains were crammed into a shaft between leaking sewage pipes, along with a knife, a rope, a section of masking tape, and two hairgrips.</p> <p>But the terrible imponderable was what had happened to her when she was still alive. Records showed that just after midnight on the morning of January 3 1974, West appeared at the casualty department of Gloucester Royal Hospital with a serious laceration to the right hand. \"It seems only too possible that she was kept alive for several days,\" writes one commentator. And yet the evidence remains entirely circumstantial. \"It is possible,\" writes another, \"that [West's] wound occurred as a result of the dismemberment of a corpse, but it is just as possible that it did not, which is the inference I should prefer the family to make.\"</p> <p>From the moment Lucy's fate became public knowledge, David had needed to nerve himself to open a newspaper. Because it was all ready to begin again: waking in the middle of the night and getting up to sit for hours weeping and swearing. This was his condition on the day after the disappearance. \"Lucy didn't come home last night.\" There was nobody in her room and the made bed had not been slept in. There was certainty of disaster. And there was my poor cousin (I hate thinking about this), out in the courtyard, crying and raising his clenched fists and saying: \"If anyone has done anything to her...\"</p> <p>It was David who drove Lucy into Cheltenham on December 27 1973.</p> <p>- I could so easily have driven her back. I offered to.</p> <p>But Lucy had decided to take the bus; and there was no point in arguing with her about a thing like that.</p> <p>- If I had insisted...</p> <p>- You could go on for ever, I said, with this chain of ifs... As you drove into town, do you remember what you talked about?</p> <p>- I was trying to justify my current girlfriend, who was - you know, sexy, but thick. Lucy was being very accommodating. Not at all critical. But I still felt I had to justify myself.</p> <p>- Six years after she disappeared - remember? When we talked about it. You were saying that you wanted to avenge her. With your own hands. Do you still?</p> <p>- No. But now, or at any other stage, I would give up my life so that Lucy could have hers. Because my life is... And hers...</p> <p>- I understand. But don't be hard on yourself. I think you're a paragon.</p> <p>- Me?</p> <p>I told David, - I've read all the books, and there's no hard evidence that it wasn't all over there and then at the bus stop. And I added, hoping to give comfort (but why would this give comfort?), - Lucy was just very unlucky, David. Your sister was just incredibly unlucky.</p> <p>Like well over 100 other souls, we converged on the Religious Society of Friends Meeting House, in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, to attend a memorial gathering for Lucy Katherine Partington, 1952-1973. The funeral itself had been postponed because Lucy's remains were still being held as evidence by the police.</p> <p>This was Elizabeth Webster, a teacher at the Arts Centre:</p> <p>\"...She came to see me when she was at Exeter, just before the last year, and I said to her, 'Now that you are grown-up, what are you going to do?' and she said, 'I don't mind what I do, as long as I do it absolutely to the hilt.' And then I said, 'Yes, that's fine, but where are you going?' and she thought awfully hard, then she said, 'Towards the light... Towards the light.'\"</p> <p>I never again want to hear anyone ask me how Lucy Partington got \"drawn into\" the orbit of the Wests. West said he killed my cousin because she wanted him to go and meet her parents. He and Lucy were having an affair (\"purely sex, end of story\"), and Lucy, now pregnant, had \"come the loving racket\" and \"said I wanna come and live with you and all this crap, and I just grabbed her by the throat\". \"[H]er wanted me to see her parents, her wanted me to do bloody everything.\"</p> <p>That is what it said, in the press, unchallenged. I rebut it. This book rebuts it.</p> <p>Everything about her, even her name, pointed towards the light. Given this, I cannot find order or meaning in a darkness so deep and durable. The death of Lucy Partington represents a fantastic collision (collide: \"from col- 'together' + laedere 'to strike'\"). It is what happens when darkness meets light, when experience meets innocence, when the false meets the true, when utter godlessness meets purity of spirit, when this -</p> <p>Hi May it your Dad Writeing to you. or lette me have your telephone number... or Write to me as soon as you can, please may I have to sort out watt Mr Ogden did to me, my new solicitors are Brilliant I Read What you sead about me in News of the that was loylty you read what Scott canavan sead he had -</p> <p>meets this -</p> <p>things are as big as you make them - <br>I can fill a whole body, <br>a whole day of life <br>with worry <br>about a few words <br>on one scrap of paper; <br>yet, the same evening, <br>looking up, <br>can frame my fingers <br>to fit the sky <br>in my cupped hands.</p> <p><b> Sweethearts and sacrificed empires</b></p> <p>As a child, my parents' marriage, I believed, loomed like a translucent horizon - a belief memorably reaffirmed by my father in Deya, Majorca, where (late at night, admittedly) he had said to my brother and me: Never doubt that I love your mother. Never doubt that we will always be together... And I didn't doubt it.</p> <p>It is very difficult, it is perhaps impossible, for someone who loves his mother to love the woman whom your father left her for. Because the Other Woman has made you cautious about love: she herself has created caution in you about love. However this may be, I got very close to loving Jane. \"I'm your wicked stepmother,\" said Jane, after the wedding. And she was my wicked stepmother - but only in the sense meant by my son, Louis, when he tells me (for instance) that he is \"wicked at Latin\".</p> <p>Jane was my wicked stepmother: she was generous, affectionate and resourceful; she salvaged my schooling and I owe her an unknowable debt for that. One flaw: sometimes, early on, she would tell me things designed to make me think less of my mother, and I would wave her away, saying, Jane, this just backfires and makes me think less of you. And she worked on this little vice, and overcame it.</p> <p>The day I finished reading my father's 1978 novel Jake's Thing, I went over to the house in Hampstead. When Jane left the room I said,</p> <p>- All that sex therapy stuff. Did you really do any of that?</p> <p>I knew something about my father's sex life. One source was Jane, who even in 1975 was telling me more about my father's growing remissness in that area than I really wanted to know. Another source was Jake's Thing.</p> <p>- Yes!</p> <p>- Christ! That genital-focusing stuff and going to bed with a ring round your cock?</p> <p>- Yes! Some of it.</p> <p>- Christ!</p> <p>- Well, in a case like this you have to show willing...</p> <p>- Yeah, but the novel didn't show willing, did it?</p> <p>And he gave me that look. Incapacitated: gently incapacitated.</p> <p>[Elizabeth Jane Howard left Kingsley in 1980. He moved in with Hilly, his first wife, and her husband Alastair Boyd, Lord Kilmarnock. The arrangement lasted until Kingsley's death in 1995.]</p> <p>To the end of his life, Kingsley maintained the following: \"the idea was\" that he would have his holiday with Jane, and then return to the family (and then go on seeing her as often as he could).</p> <p>\"It's only half a life without a woman,\" he said to me, later; the woman, the wife, the other half, was gone - and no successor would be sought. My father never again kissed a woman with passion. This from a man who used to live for adultery...</p> <p>When my parents' marriage broke up, in the 60s, the newspapers covered it. And when my marriage broke up, 30 years later, the newspapers covered it (with noticeable differences in the journalistic approach). When my father had his teeth fixed, in the 60s, the newspapers didn't cover it. And when I had my teeth fixed, 30 years later, the newspapers covered it. My teeth made headlines. But let me tell you something about experience. It outstrips all accounts of it - all ulterior versions. A man having a full scale epileptic fit on the street corner does not mind about the tittering of nearby children. He is involved in his own triage.</p> <p>In 1993, over dinner, my father said,</p> <p>- Say as little as you want or as much as you want.</p> <p>And I told him about my recent visit to Cape Cod to see my children, and their mother - to whom I had become a stranger, from whom I was estranged. The boys sensed that there was a possibility of reconciliation. On the first morning, Jacob pushed my coffee cup an inch nearer my right hand and said, \"Enjoying your stay so far?\"...</p> <p>Five days later, as I prepared to leave, the pond outside the house was obediently reflecting the mass of doom stacked up in the sky. My sons were constructing a miniature zoo on a patch of grass; Louis showed me the little stunt where you dropped a coin down a complicated tunnel and were then issued with your ticket of admission. But I wasn't staying, and they knew it. They knew I was leaving. They knew the thing had failed - the whole thing had failed. I said goodbye and climbed into the rented car.</p> <p>- I just can't stop thinking about it. I just can't get it out of my mind.</p> <p>- There's nothing you can do with things like that. You can only hope to coexist with them. They never go away. They're always with you. They're just - there...</p> <p>Yes, always available for delectation, and always undiminished in their power. On the night flight back to London, I performed what seemed to me to be the extraordinary feat of shedding tears throughout the full six hours, even during the shallow sleep I kept snapping out of. I wondered about the physiology of weeping: questions of storage and supply. In my delirium, I was vexed by the parenthetical thought that there was an indicator flashing in the cockpit, something like the watering can symbol on the dashboard of a car, telling me that I had at last used up all my spray.</p> <p>In leaving home, I did what I did for love. But how does it look, the love ledger, by the time you're done? Because you are also the enemy of love and - for your children - its despoiler. \"I hate love,\" said my son Louis at the age of five or six (he was complaining about the love interest in a book we were reading). He didn't mean that, but he could now say: \"I no longer trust it.\"</p> <p>When Dryden retold the story of Antony and Cleopatra, he called his tragedy All For Love (or The World Well Lost). Those stupendous sweethearts sacrificed empires, but they were certain that love, the primary value, was being exalted even in their defeats and their suicides. I envy them the flourish. We who absent ourselves from the daily company of our children must reckon it differently. Love comes out of it with gains but also with losses. And whenever death is losing, the force of death makes gains. Divorce: the incredibly violent thing. What parent, involved in it, has not wished for the death of the once-loved one? This is universal. And this is why your heart feels gangrenous inside your chest. This is why (as I put it to myself) you want men in white to come and take you away and wash your blood.</p> <p>\"Stopping being married to someone,\" my father had written, 10 years earlier, \"is an incredibly violent thing to happen to you, not easy to take in completely, ever.\" He knew I was now absorbing the truth and the force of this. And he knew also that the process could not be softened or hastened. All you could do was survive it. That surviving was a possibility he showed me, by example. But he did more. He roused himself and did more. \"Talk as much as you want about it or as little as you want.\" These words sounded like civilisation to me, in my barbarous state, so dishevelled in body and mind.</p> <p>Talk as much or as little... I talked much. Only to him could I confess how terrible I felt, how physically terrible, bemused, subnormalised, stupefied from within, and always about to flinch or tremble from the effort of making my face look honest, kind, sane. Only to him could I talk about what I was doing to my children. Because he had done it to me.</p> <p>\u0095 \u00a9 Martin Amis 2000.

Not at all critical. But I still felt I had to justify myself. - Six years after she disappeared - remember? When we talked about it. You were saying that you wanted to avenge her. With your own hands. Do you still? - No. But now, or at any other stage, I would give up my life so that Lucy could have hers. Because my life is... And hers... - I understand. But don't be hard on yourself. I think you're a paragon. - Me? I told David, - I've read all the books, and there's no hard evidence that it wasn't all over there and then at the bus stop. And I added, hoping to give comfort (but why would this give comfort?), - Lucy was just very unlucky, David. Your sister was just incredibly unlucky. Like well over 100 other souls, we converged on the Religious Society of Friends Meeting House, in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, to attend a memorial gathering for Lucy Katherine Partington, 1952-1973. The funeral itself had been postponed because Lucy's remains were still being held as evidence by the police. This was Elizabeth Webster, a teacher at the Arts Centre: \"...She came to see me when she was at Exeter, just before the last year, and I said to her, 'Now that you are grown-up, what are you going to do?' and she said, 'I don't mind what I do, as long as I do it absolutely to the hilt.' And then I said, 'Yes, that's fine, but where are you going?' and she thought awfully hard, then she said, 'Towards the light... Towards the light.'\" I never again want to hear anyone ask me how Lucy Partington got \"drawn into\" the orbit of the Wests. West said he killed my cousin because she wanted him to go and meet her parents. He and Lucy were having an affair (\"purely sex, end of story\"), and Lucy, now pregnant, had \"come the loving racket\" and \"said I wanna come and live with you and all this crap, and I just grabbed her by the throat\". \"[H]er wanted me to see her parents, her wanted me to do bloody everything.\" That is what it said, in the press, unchallenged. I rebut it. This book rebuts it. Everything about her, even her name, pointed towards the light. Given this, I cannot find order or meaning in a darkness so deep and durable. The death of Lucy Partington represents a fantastic collision (collide: \"from col- 'together' + laedere 'to strike'\"). It is what happens when darkness meets light, when experience meets innocence, when the false meets the true, when utter godlessness meets purity of spirit, when this - Hi May it your Dad Writeing to you. or lette me have your telephone number... or Write to me as soon as you can, please may I have to sort out watt Mr Ogden did to me, my new solicitors are Brilliant I Read What you sead about me in News of the that was loylty you read what Scott canavan sead he had - meets this - things are as big as you make them - I can fill a whole body, a whole day of life with worry about a few words on one scrap of paper; yet, the same evening, looking up, can frame my fingers to fit the sky in my cupped hands. Sweethearts and sacrificed empires As a child, my parents' marriage, I believed, loomed like a translucent horizon - a belief memorably reaffirmed by my father in Deya, Majorca, where (late at night, admittedly) he had said to my brother and me: Never doubt that I love your mother. Never doubt that we will always be together... And I didn't doubt it. It is very difficult, it is perhaps impossible, for someone who loves his mother to love the woman whom your father left her for. Because the Other Woman has made you cautious about love: she herself has created caution in you about love. However this may be, I got very close to loving Jane. \"I'm your wicked stepmother,\" said Jane, after the wedding. And she was my wicked stepmother - but only in the sense meant by my son, Louis, when he tells me (for instance) that he is \"wicked at Latin\". Jane was my wicked stepmother: she was generous, affectionate and resourceful; she salvaged my schooling and I owe her an unknowable debt for that. One flaw: sometimes, early on, she would tell me things designed to make me think less of my mother, and I would wave her away, saying, Jane, this just backfires and makes me think less of you. And she worked on this little vice, and overcame it. The day I finished reading my father's 1978 novel Jake's Thing, I went over to the house in Hampstead. When Jane left the room I said, - All that sex therapy stuff. Did you really do any of that? I knew something about my father's sex life. One source was Jane, who even in 1975 was telling me more about my father's growing remissness in that area than I really wanted to know. Another source was Jake's Thing. - Yes! - Christ! That genital-focusing stuff and going to bed with a ring round your cock? - Yes! Some of it. - Christ! - Well, in a case like this you have to show willing... - Yeah, but the novel didn't show willing, did it? And he gave me that look. Incapacitated: gently incapacitated. [Elizabeth Jane Howard left Kingsley in 1980. He moved in with Hilly, his first wife, and her husband Alastair Boyd, Lord Kilmarnock. The arrangement lasted until Kingsley's death in 1995.] To the end of his life, Kingsley maintained the following: \"the idea was\" that he would have his holiday with Jane, and then return to the family (and then go on seeing her as often as he could). \"It's only half a life without a woman,\" he said to me, later; the woman, the wife, the other half, was gone - and no successor would be sought. My father never again kissed a woman with passion. This from a man who used to live for adultery... When my parents' marriage broke up, in the 60s, the newspapers covered it. And when my marriage broke up, 30 years later, the newspapers covered it (with noticeable differences in the journalistic approach). When my father had his teeth fixed, in the 60s, the newspapers didn't cover it. And when I had my teeth fixed, 30 years later, the newspapers covered it. My teeth made headlines. But let me tell you something about experience. It outstrips all accounts of it - all ulterior versions. A man having a full scale epileptic fit on the street corner does not mind about the tittering of nearby children. He is involved in his own triage. In 1993, over dinner, my father said, - Say as little as you want or as much as you want. And I told him about my recent visit to Cape Cod to see my children, and their mother - to whom I had become a stranger, from whom I was estranged. The boys sensed that there was a possibility of reconciliation. On the first morning, Jacob pushed my coffee cup an inch nearer my right hand and said, \"Enjoying your stay so far?\"... Five days later, as I prepared to leave, the pond outside the house was obediently reflecting the mass of doom stacked up in the sky. My sons were constructing a miniature zoo on a patch of grass; Louis showed me the little stunt where you dropped a coin down a complicated tunnel and were then issued with your ticket of admission. But I wasn't staying, and they knew it. They knew I was leaving. They knew the thing had failed - the whole thing had failed. I said goodbye and climbed into the rented car. - I just can't stop thinking about it. I just can't get it out of my mind. - There's nothing you can do with things like that. You can only hope to coexist with them. They never go away. They're always with you. They're just - there... Yes, always available for delectation, and always undiminished in their power. On the night flight back to London, I performed what seemed to me to be the extraordinary feat of shedding tears throughout the full six hours, even during the shallow sleep I kept snapping out of. I wondered about the physiology of weeping: questions of storage and supply. In my delirium, I was vexed by the parenthetical thought that there was an indicator flashing in the cockpit, something like the watering can symbol on the dashboard of a car, telling me that I had at last used up all my spray. In leaving home, I did what I did for love. But how does it look, the love ledger, by the time you're done? Because you are also the enemy of love and - for your children - its despoiler. \"I hate love,\" said my son Louis at the age of five or six (he was complaining about the love interest in a book we were reading). He didn't mean that, but he could now say: \"I no longer trust it.\" When Dryden retold the story of Antony and Cleopatra, he called his tragedy All For Love (or The World Well Lost). Those stupendous sweethearts sacrificed empires, but they were certain that love, the primary value, was being exalted even in their defeats and their suicides. I envy them the flourish. We who absent ourselves from the daily company of our children must reckon it differently. Love comes out of it with gains but also with losses. And whenever death is losing, the force of death makes gains. Divorce: the incredibly violent thing. What parent, involved in it, has not wished for the death of the once-loved one? This is universal. And this is why your heart feels gangrenous inside your chest. This is why (as I put it to myself) you want men in white to come and take you away and wash your blood. \"Stopping being married to someone,\" my father had written, 10 years earlier, \"is an incredibly violent thing to happen to you, not easy to take in completely, ever.\" He knew I was now absorbing the truth and the force of this. And he knew also that the process could not be softened or hastened. All you could do was survive it. That surviving was a possibility he showed me, by example. But he did more. He roused himself and did more. \"Talk as much as you want about it or as little as you want.\" These words sounded like civilisation to me, in my barbarous state, so dishevelled in body and mind. Talk as much or as little... I talked much. Only to him could I confess how terrible I felt, how physically terrible, bemused, subnormalised, stupefied from within, and always about to flinch or tremble from the effort of making my face look honest, kind, sane. Only to him could I talk about what I was doing to my children. Because he had done it to me. \u0095 \u00a9 Martin Amis 2000. Experience by Martin Amis is published by Jonathan Cape, price \u00a318.

There was a cocktail of problems, including low aspirations among some families and schools. But some universities recruited less than half their students from state schools and he singled out medical schools in particular.</p> <p>\"It is not simply prejudice by admissions tutors - although it would be interesting to see the social background of some of them to find out whether we need summer schools for admissions tutors and not just for students seeking entry.\"</p> <p>He added: \"We are in a new century. For universities to be taking such a small proportion of students from deprived areas or even from the state sector is no longer acceptable. \"We are not talking about diluting entry standards but of equal treatment for those who get high scores at A-level.\"</p> <p>The conference was also told that British universities were missing out on millions of pounds of income because they were \"bloody useless\" at patenting and exploiting their inventions.

      "bodyText": "Snobbish admissions officers were helping to keep working class youngsters out of universities and medical schools, David Blunkett, the education secretary, suggested yesterday. Announcing student bursaries of up to \u00a31,000 for poor students as part of a \u00a34m drive to open up access to higher education, Mr Blunkett told the Association of University Teachers annual conference in Eastbourne that universities would have to change. Someone from a private school was nearly 30 times as likely to get into one of the top universities as someone from a disadvantaged background. Mr Blunkett said he had been the only one from his working class area of Sheffield who had gone to university. There was a cocktail of problems, including low aspirations among some families and schools. But some universities recruited less than half their students from state schools and he singled out medical schools in particular. \"It is not simply prejudice by admissions tutors - although it would be interesting to see the social background of some of them to find out whether we need summer schools for admissions tutors and not just for students seeking entry.\" He added: \"We are in a new century. For universities to be taking such a small proportion of students from deprived areas or even from the state sector is no longer acceptable. \"We are not talking about diluting entry standards but of equal treatment for those who get high scores at A-level.\" The conference was also told that British universities were missing out on millions of pounds of income because they were \"bloody useless\" at patenting and exploiting their inventions. David Triesman, the association's general secretary, accused universities of failing to help themselves by making sure they benefited from inventions.",

It is guided by more obviously teenage preferences, set in a fantasy world called Aquaselva where the hero, Cathan, defends the minority beliefs of his clan against an oppressive regime. This is not an allegory for Audley's adolescent rage against the machine: he is quiet and measured, sitting in his agent's house looking mildly alarmed at having to explain something that just popped out as a diversion from A-level revision. \"I had been reading fantasy and sci-fi books for a long time and I'd been writing short stories for a couple of years, so I was looking for a subject for a novel. In Heresy I found one that wasn't too long.\" </p> <p>Audley doesn't speak like a precocious teen. He is reluctant to embark on long sentences or sell himself as a personality with which to market the book. He is dressed sensibly, not fashionably. He doesn't represent the angry youth of his native Dorset. He plays the bassoon to grade eight and dislikes PE. He is the sort of boy who, in the 80s, used to spend his lunch hours playing epic games of Dungeons and Dragons but now dedicates it to computers. The first fantasy story he wrote was at the age of nine and it was returned to him underscored in red ink, with the judgment, \"There are no volcanoes in Cumbria.\" </p> <p>All of which contributes to the rare possibility that Anselm Audley will be a teenage novelist whose book is more interesting than him. </p> <p>His writing regime was not structured by an ambitious plan - it just evolved. Audley was a day scholar at Millfield public school and would not get home before 7pm, sometimes writing until 11pm. His parents, both translators of German, French and eastern European languages, worried that he would jeopardise his exams, but last year he won a place to read history at St John's College, Oxford, on the strength of three A grades at A-level. </p> <p>The idea for Heresy came while Audley was on holiday with his parents in the south of France. \"We were in a region where they had a lot of heresy and things,\" he says, quietly. \"It's their main tourist point. I had written stories of over 10,000 words before, and was looking for something to write a novel about. The central character gets caught up in the whole religion and heresy thing.\" He adds rather quickly, \"It is not a children's book.\" </p> <p>Audley wrote Heresy in eight months and sent it to the agent James Hale, a friend of his parents who represents Iain Banks. Hale made a couple of suggestions about the book's chronology, before sending it to the publishers Simon and Schuster. Audley was \"stunned\", he says, when the publisher came back with a \u00a350,000 three-book deal. Judging by his demeanour, he's still getting over it. </p> <p>He hasn't seen any of the money yet but is expecting a cheque to arrive within the next couple of weeks, although he softly admits that he is not one for spending sprees. For his year out, he has chosen to study for two more A-levels in physics and ancient history, \"just for fun\". That takes up his mornings, and he spends the afternoon working on Inquisition, part two of his trilogy.

It seems barely three years - it is barely three years - since that glorious summer when the prime minister came on the radio and told a sombre and fearful nation that we were at war, mainly with each other. The fields were yellow with oilseed rape, the hedges stiff with mayflower. The heat lay heavily upon the land, like an incontinent labrador. It seemed impossible that anything could destroy the peace of that tranquil springtime. But even as we sheltered in the open air, next to munitions dumps if necessary, to escape the deafening barrage of the election broadcasts that threatened our whole way of life, we could see the first press plane climb in the sky, carrying the brave young men and women of the media towards the political struggle.

      "body": "<p>Ford is to confirm 2,000 job losses at its Dagenham plant tomorrow, ending car production by the company in Britain after 69 years. </p> <p>The decision means that after November 2001, none of the 442,000 Ford cars bought annually in the UK will have been made in this country. </p> <p>Ford is to sugar the pill by announcing heavy investment in engine production at the plant, in east London. For the first time Jaguar and Volvo engines will be made alongside Ford diesels. Other engine work also will be transferred from Detroit to Dagenham. </p> <p>But Ford's plan to end car production in Britain, where it enjoys 20% of the market, and transfer production to Germany, where it has 6% of sales, triggered union protests. </p> <p>The government, relieved at the rescue of Rover's Longbridge plant this week, faces new pressure to intervene and save car making at Dagenham. </p> <p>Union leaders last night said Ford had broken a promise to build its new Fiesta model in the UK when the current version is scrapped in 18 months. </p> <p>The prime minister, Tony Blair, yesterday appeared resigned to the end of car production at Dagenham when he said the government would help those put out of work. </p> <p>\"We will be there to help with money, investment and advice for anyone who does lose their job,\" he said. </p> <p>Ford makes luxury Jaguar models in the West Midlands and at Halewood on Merseyside. Its Transit vans will still be produced in Southampton. </p> <p>The number of redundancies at Dagenham has been scaled down from 3,000 to 2,000 in an attempt to defuse anger. Payoffs, which union negotiators estimate are worth up to \u00a355,000, are being offered to assembly workers to encourage them to go quietly. </p> <p>Notices pinned on walls of the Dagenham plant by workers read: \"Closing down sale - everything must go.\" </p> <p>Union leaders claim Dagenham is now more efficient than Cologne, where the new Fiesta will be made. They say it takes 24.4 hours to build a car in the UK plant, compared with 25.3 hours in Germany. </p> <p>Sir Ken Jackson, the general secretary of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union, said: \"Ford will have broken the commitment they made to us guaranteeing car production at Dagenham. </p> <p>\"We have a number of meetings and it is too early to say exactly what will happen, but if car assembly does end it will have a severe impact on the local economy.\" </p> <p>Tony Woodley, of the Transport and General Workers Union, said: \"Ending car as sembly at Dagenham is pure corporate greed. Workers are to be sacked in Britain because it is cheap and easy for Ford. To sell 442,000 cars and not build one here is a disgrace.\" </p> <p>Dagenham's fate became clearer as it emerged that the \u00a3575m BMW made available to Phoenix to take over Longbridge was effectively a sweetener. Company sources said \u00a375m is a donation and \u00a3500m is an interest free loan not payable for 50 years unless the firm is sold on. </p> <p>The newly-elected London mayor, Ken Livingstone, said the end of mass car production at Dagenham would be a \"body blow\" to one of London's poorest areas.

      "bodyText": "Ford is to confirm 2,000 job losses at its Dagenham plant tomorrow, ending car production by the company in Britain after 69 years. The decision means that after November 2001, none of the 442,000 Ford cars bought annually in the UK will have been made in this country. Ford is to sugar the pill by announcing heavy investment in engine production at the plant, in east London. For the first time Jaguar and Volvo engines will be made alongside Ford diesels. Other engine work also will be transferred from Detroit to Dagenham. But Ford's plan to end car production in Britain, where it enjoys 20% of the market, and transfer production to Germany, where it has 6% of sales, triggered union protests. The government, relieved at the rescue of Rover's Longbridge plant this week, faces new pressure to intervene and save car making at Dagenham. Union leaders last night said Ford had broken a promise to build its new Fiesta model in the UK when the current version is scrapped in 18 months. The prime minister, Tony Blair, yesterday appeared resigned to the end of car production at Dagenham when he said the government would help those put out of work. \"We will be there to help with money, investment and advice for anyone who does lose their job,\" he said. Ford makes luxury Jaguar models in the West Midlands and at Halewood on Merseyside. Its Transit vans will still be produced in Southampton. The number of redundancies at Dagenham has been scaled down from 3,000 to 2,000 in an attempt to defuse anger. Payoffs, which union negotiators estimate are worth up to \u00a355,000, are being offered to assembly workers to encourage them to go quietly. Notices pinned on walls of the Dagenham plant by workers read: \"Closing down sale - everything must go.\" Union leaders claim Dagenham is now more efficient than Cologne, where the new Fiesta will be made. They say it takes 24.4 hours to build a car in the UK plant, compared with 25.3 hours in Germany. Sir Ken Jackson, the general secretary of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union, said: \"Ford will have broken the commitment they made to us guaranteeing car production at Dagenham. \"We have a number of meetings and it is too early to say exactly what will happen, but if car assembly does end it will have a severe impact on the local economy.\" Tony Woodley, of the Transport and General Workers Union, said: \"Ending car as sembly at Dagenham is pure corporate greed. Workers are to be sacked in Britain because it is cheap and easy for Ford. To sell 442,000 cars and not build one here is a disgrace.\" Dagenham's fate became clearer as it emerged that the \u00a3575m BMW made available to Phoenix to take over Longbridge was effectively a sweetener. Company sources said \u00a375m is a donation and \u00a3500m is an interest free loan not payable for 50 years unless the firm is sold on. The newly-elected London mayor, Ken Livingstone, said the end of mass car production at Dagenham would be a \"body blow\" to one of London's poorest areas. He warned that Ford could face \"a backlash\" from angry Britons. William Hague, the Tory leader, said 206,000 manufacturing jobs had been lost under Mr Blair's government.",

In this opposition they put their livelihoods on the line because of legal fees costing I\u00a3150,000.

This morning very early dawn had not broken in glory on sea or land, only a few pale fingers of light stroked the darkness - I saw what looked like a short post about two feet high. It was a hare standing on its hind legs and gazing intently at the window. I was afraid to breathe. We each stood immobile - I never relaxed my watching the hare and it matched my attention, though what it saw I know not.</p> <p>Gradually the fingers of light joined, dispelling the dark. The hare turned its head, dropped on all fours and sauntered away in silence, not even inviting me, as the March Hare invited Alice, to \"take some more tea\".</p>",

Bluebells, early purple orchids and just flowering mountain avens line the roadsides from Poulnabrone Dolmen downhill to Ballyvaughan. Last month I wrote about how the Burren action group opposed for nine years a government project to build a visitor centre at isolated Mullaghmore. In this opposition they put their livelihoods on the line because of legal fees costing I\u00a3150,000. I wrote that the minister had her team searching for a technicality on which to appeal the decision of the highest planning authority against the construction of the visitor centre. She has now decided not to appeal - a well deserved victory for the group. Now we are dipping into our pockets to help pay their legal fees. A race night is to be held later this month. For I\u00a320 a horse, jockey and trainer may be entered for the race, their names chosen by the contributor. Our horse is called Escargot! We hope to win. This recalls the word we, as children in Co Wexford, used for snail - shellacapookie. Lovely. And where did it originate? So spring glides into summer in a hazy warmth and a sense of happiness that a part of the environment of these islands has been saved, not by money but by real devotion to, by the constancy of love for a place of beauty, remote, tranquil, austere. This morning very early dawn had not broken in glory on sea or land, only a few pale fingers of light stroked the darkness - I saw what looked like a short post about two feet high. It was a hare standing on its hind legs and gazing intently at the window. I was afraid to breathe. We each stood immobile - I never relaxed my watching the hare and it matched my attention, though what it saw I know not. Gradually the fingers of light joined, dispelling the dark. The hare turned its head, dropped on all fours and sauntered away in silence, not even inviting me, as the March Hare invited Alice, to \"take some more tea\".",

      "bodyText": "British Midland's chairman, Sir Michael Bishop, yesterday outlined ambitious plans for expansion as he launched the airline's service to Madrid. Insiders say Sir Michael has had indications from the government that the long-awaited deal on transatlantic flights is within sight, allowing it to begin flying to the US within a year. The airline is also looking at new European routes, which could include Barcelona, Lisbon and Zurich. Expansion is likely to create around 3,000 jobs over the next five years and the airline is likely to be rebranded; Bluebird is one possibility. Sir Michael said: \"This will be a year of significant transition, we've got a big job to do.\" British Midland has won licences to fly to New York, Washington, Miami and Boston and wants to begin next May. Sir Michael wants to launch services from Manchester and Heathrow simultaneously. But they cannot start until the long-running \"open skies\" talks between the British and US governments are resolved. Sir Michael said: \"The tone of statements from the government is very different from at the start of the year.\" Lord Macdonald, the transport minister, had suggested Heathrow could be a hub for both British Midland's Star Alliance and the rival One World group which includes British Airways. The Madrid service is a collaboration with Star partners SAS and Lufthansa. The route was previously the preserve of BA and Iberia - both One World members - and Sir Michael expects further challenges to his rivals around Europe. The airline is Britain's second largest, carrying 7m passengers a year. Sir Michael, who owns 60%, said flotation was a long-term option once the company had secured a strong earnings stream.",

Restrictions placed on the deal by regulators in Washington have effectively scuppered the bid, which will lapse at the end of the week. The company - which accepted the \u00a37.2bn bid in July - said yesterday it had undergone significant restructuring and reorganisation over the past two years and was confident of its ability to develop its business unaided. Air Liquide and Air Products said they are prepared to consider whether a new offer acceptable to BOC can be made. Any such new offer would involve a different structure and price, they said. Four giant groups dominate the world's industrial gases market, with a total 60% share. The Air Liquide-Air Products deal was always going to hit regulatory problems, given that two of these groups were proposing to carve up a third between them. Prior to the joint offer, the conventional wisdom had been that only one merger at the most, involving two of the four, would be permitted, giving a huge incentive to be first in the race to get together. To that end, BOC opened talks with the largest gases group, America's Praxair, but they stalled in early 1999. BOC then started talking to Air Liquide about a friendly tie-up, but Air Liquide surprised BOC in June by proposing a break-up bid involving Air Products. Initially, BOC threw out the the offer but in July agreed to end 130 years of independence and recommend the deal to shareholders. Under the proposals, Air Liquide would take over BOC operations in Britain and Ireland, half of its activities in the US its subsidiaries in Japan and those in some other Asian countries. Air Products would take those in Australia and New Zealand, the other half of BOC's US operations and the remaining businesses in Asia. Negotiations opened with regulators in Brussels and with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in Washington. In the event, it was the FTC which was to prove the stumbling block. Air Products and Air Liquide said yesterday that during 10 months of discussions with the commission they had made \"a number of comprehensive and practical proposals, including divestitures, which responded to the demands of the FTC.\" But it had recently become clear that the FTC would not approve the offer by the May 12 expiry date, and so the offer would not go ahead.

BSkyB and chairman Rupert Murdoch have been accused of being slow to recognise the importance of the internet but chief executive Tony Ball insisted the acquisition was a sound one and puts its own web development strategy one year ahead of schedule. </p> <p>The costs of rolling out its digital service continue to weigh heavily on BSkyB's balance sheet, accounting for a fourth consecutive quarter of losses. However, analysts say the investment has been worthwhile. </p> <p>BSkyB added 316,000 new digital subscribers during the three months ended March 31 and with a further 398,000 existing analogue customers making the switch it had 3.4m digital subscribers by May 9. Mr Ball wants to have 5m digital subscribers by the end of the year. \"In the past 12 months we have attracted an additional 2.3m subscribers to the digital platform, underlining what has been the fastest digital launch by any European platform,\" he said. </p> <p>Peter Misek, analyst at Chase H&amp;Q, said: \"BSkyB is way ahead of its rivals with its digital numbers. However, there is a lot of uncertainty because of the football rights. If they win them for less than \u00a31.5bn I'd be happy for them. Anything more would be a short-term negative for the stock.\" </p> <p>The quarterly pre-tax loss of \u00a328.4m compared with a profit of \u00a316m year-on-year. Operating costs rose from \u00a3345.2m to \u00a3443.9m, while sales rose from \u00a3391.1m to \u00a3467.2m. </p> <p>Peter Wilkinson, Sports Internet's main shareholder, stands to receive around \u00a3130m worth of BSkyB shares for his stake, has been tied into the company for two years. </p> <p>He is expected to use BSkyB's financial muscle to move into new sports - notably horse racing - and advise on how the broadcaster can leverage his Planetfootball.com brand into its interactive television service. </p> <p>Other Sports Internet shareholders celebrating the deal include Chris Akers, the company's executive chairman whose holding is valued at \u00a317m, and Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood.</p>",

Some also questioned whether it had overpaid for ther soccer website and tax-free betting company, Sports Internet, by agreeing a \u00a3303m all-share deal. BSkyB and chairman Rupert Murdoch have been accused of being slow to recognise the importance of the internet but chief executive Tony Ball insisted the acquisition was a sound one and puts its own web development strategy one year ahead of schedule. The costs of rolling out its digital service continue to weigh heavily on BSkyB's balance sheet, accounting for a fourth consecutive quarter of losses. However, analysts say the investment has been worthwhile. BSkyB added 316,000 new digital subscribers during the three months ended March 31 and with a further 398,000 existing analogue customers making the switch it had 3.4m digital subscribers by May 9. Mr Ball wants to have 5m digital subscribers by the end of the year. \"In the past 12 months we have attracted an additional 2.3m subscribers to the digital platform, underlining what has been the fastest digital launch by any European platform,\" he said. Peter Misek, analyst at Chase H&amp;Q, said: \"BSkyB is way ahead of its rivals with its digital numbers. However, there is a lot of uncertainty because of the football rights. If they win them for less than \u00a31.5bn I'd be happy for them. Anything more would be a short-term negative for the stock.\" The quarterly pre-tax loss of \u00a328.4m compared with a profit of \u00a316m year-on-year. Operating costs rose from \u00a3345.2m to \u00a3443.9m, while sales rose from \u00a3391.1m to \u00a3467.2m. Peter Wilkinson, Sports Internet's main shareholder, stands to receive around \u00a3130m worth of BSkyB shares for his stake, has been tied into the company for two years. He is expected to use BSkyB's financial muscle to move into new sports - notably horse racing - and advise on how the broadcaster can leverage his Planetfootball.com brand into its interactive television service. Other Sports Internet shareholders celebrating the deal include Chris Akers, the company's executive chairman whose holding is valued at \u00a317m, and Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood.",

His training questions did not cover the busiest section of his route between Paddington and Ladbroke Grove, he was not told about the risks of passing red signals, particularly signal 109 at Ladbroke Grove, and his company failed to send him on a special red signal awareness day. It was also revealed for the first time that Mr Hodder should not have been driving because he had a criminal record. The inquiry, opened by Lord Cullen in London, heard that Mr Hodder, who was among the 31 people who died in the crash, had failed to disclose at his interview with Thames Trains that he had been convicted by magistrates a year earlier of assault and affray, and been given a conditional discharge. Robert Owen QC, counsel to the inquiry, said that Thames Trains would probably not have offered Mr Hodder a job if it had known of the conviction.

One day a bright spark - let's call him Fred - offers to carry messages between islanders, a service that rapidly becomes very popular. Then he has another good idea: he clears one side of a big tree and encourages people to carve messages on it. Who should be held responsible if one islander defames another, or wrongly accuses him of a heinous crime? Simple, surely: whoever wrote the message. At any rate, not Fred. But what if Fred begins removing messages he does not like from his tree? And what if it becomes impossible to track down the authors of specific messages?

For Alusein, seven, his brother, Mohamed, six, and their sister, Hafsatu, three, are stranded in Freetown, and their mother, a British national who fled before the last bout of bloodshed, is in a council flat in Mitcham, Surrey. Their separation came about because Ms Sandy, who was born in south-east London but moved to Sierra Leone at the age of three, was allowed on the plane which evacuated Britons from the troubled west African country on Christmas Eve 1998, days before Revolutionary United Front rebels temporarily seized the capital leaving 6,000 dead. But, despite having registered her children as British citizens a month earlier, Ms Sandy, 26, was not allowed to bring them with her because they had no British passports. Sixteen months on, the situation has not altered; and, with the imminent threat of further massacres, the youngsters - taken by their Sierra Leonean father to the hotel-turned-evacuation-centre - are among the many who have been turned away. It is a situation which leaves Ms Sandy, a cleaner at a London teaching hospital, feeling helpless and desperate. \"At times, I'm crying all the time. I don't want to eat, I can't sleep.

But the report highlights the scale of the social justice problem, with April 1998 figures showing that about 3m children were still living below the poverty line in families with incomes of less than 60% of the median - the middle value - income. </p> <p>The report is a first for the office of national statistics and is a mark of a new official recognition of the need to tackle social exclusion. Such a publication never appeared during the 18 years of Conservative governments. </p> <p>The report also shows that the pay gap between men and women remains as wide as ever. Average gross annual earnings for April 1999 show that men in full time jobs earned about \u00a323,000 a year - 42% more than the average \u00a316,000 a year earned by women in full time work. </p> <p>Despite this growing pay gap between men and women the ONS reports confirms that girls continue to do better than boys at school with 50% of girls getting five or more good GCSE passes compared with only 40% of boys. There has also been a much more rapid expansion in the number of young women in higher and further education from 1m in 1970 to about 2.5m by 1998. </p> <p>The ONS report confirms some of the seismic shifts in the profile of Britain's population of 59m people. There are 4m from minority ethnic groups, who have a younger age profile than the white population. Between 1961 and 1998 the proportion of households headed by a lone parent rose from 2% to 7% and a quarter of black families are lone parents with dependent children. </p> <p>In one crucial area - infant mortality - the gap between rich and poor has narrowed slightly in the last 29 years. In 1976 the death rate for babies born to families of \"unskilled\" workers was more than twice that for babies born to those with \"professional\" jobs. By 1997 the infant mortality rate for children of unskilled workers had fallen to just under twice that of the professional group. </p> <p>The ONS report also reveals that during the 1970s the income of households at the top, middle and bottom of the scale grew at roughly the same pace but during the 1980s income inequality rose. The top 10% saw their incomes grow by 38% over the decade while the bottom 10% only saw incomes rise by around 5%. </p> <p>During the 1990s there was greater stability but the figures show that the rate of growth of the incomes of the top 10% con tinued to outstrip improvements at the bottom. At the start of the 1970s the incomes of the richest 10% were three times higher than the poorest 10%. By the end of the 1990s they were four times higher. </p> <p>The report shows that the distribution of wealth - as opposed to income - has altered little in the past 20 years and is even more unevenly distributed. In 1996 1% of the population owned 20% of the wealth - about \u00a3388bn. Over half the total wealth was owned by 10% of the population. In the same year, the wealthiest 50% owned almost all the wealth, 93%. </p> <p>In 1997-98 about 30% of households said they had no savings and over half had savings of less than \u00a31,500. Only 14% of households had savings of more than \u00a320,000. </p> <p> <b>Gender: Men earn 42% more than women with full time jobs</b><br> The pay gap between men and women remains as wide as ever with men in full time work earning on average \u00a323,000 a year, some 42% higher than the average income of \u00a316,000 a year for women in full-time jobs, according to the office of national statistics report. </p> <p>This pay gap appears to be true across all jobs with women working full time earning on average 60% to 70% less than men in the same occupational group. </p> <p>About 45% of working women are employed on a part time basis, with men in similar jobs getting an hourly rate about one third higher than that paid to women. </p> <p>The ONS report does show, however, that over the last 20 years the proportion of men who work has fallen from 88% in 1984 to 84% by 1999, and over the same period the proportion of women of working age with jobs rose from 66% to 72%. </p> <p>The increasing role of women in the workforce is put in stark relief by a comparison of occupations in 1891 with those in 1991. </p> <p>At the end of the 19th century about 1.5m women - by far the largest single group - worked as domestic servants. By 1991 the figure for women working as cleaners and housekeepers had fallen to 800,000. </p> <p>By the end of the 20th century women still dominated some occupations such as nursing and teaching but the variety is as great as it is for men. </p> <p>The ONS survey also hits at the idea that the \"job for life\" is a thing of the past.

The report says high levels of children eligible for free school meals generally correspond with lower GCSE attainment levels. </p> <p>When it comes to social class, the differences are even more striking.

But it admitted that its defences had been overrun at Ariyalai military base, on a peninsula to the south-west of Jaffna. The town itself remained firmly in Sri Lankan army control, officials said.</p> <p>\"[The Tigers] have breached the line but now we are consolidating in the area,\" a military spokesman, Brigadier Palitho Fernando, said. \"Of course this is a fast-changing situation. The fighting is still going on.\"</p> <p>Military sources last night said that Navatkuli bridge was now in no-man's land - between rebel positions dug in to the east of the bridge, and government forces to the west.</p> <p>Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) troops were also trying to infiltrate into Jaffna, they added.</p> <p>The Sri Lankan information ministry claimed that suicide attackers - many of them women and children - had taken part in the offensive. \"Terrorists continued to fire a heavy volume of artillery and mortars. Troops fought back effectively, repulsing a number of human waves of the attackers,\" a government statement added.</p> <p>The attack came 24 hours after Sri Lanka's president, Chandrika Kumaratunga, flatly rejected a temporary ceasefire offer by the Tigers to allow the 40,000 Sri Lankan troops marooned in Jaffna to evacuate. The rebels had warned that rejection would lead to \"disastrous consequences\".</p> <p>In a statement from its London headquarters, the Tigers yesterday said that their commando units launched a massive offensive on three fronts in the early hours of yesterday morning, attacking Sri Lankan army bases at Thanankilappu, Ariyalai and Navatkuli.</p> <p>The rebels described yesterday's attack as part of an ongoing operation dubbed \"Unceasing Waves 3\". The operation, which began in November, has seen the Tigers make their most spectacular gains since they lost Jaffna and much of northern Sri Lanka to a government advance in 1995.</p> <p>On April 22 they seized Elephant Pass, a key military base and gateway to the peninsula. Ten days ago they seized a second military base at Palali, before scaling back hostilities while Indian diplomats secretly tried to broker a ceasefire.</p> <p>Government forces had expected the rebels to continue their attack on Kilaly, a naval base 14 miles from Jaffna, close to the rebel front line. Instead, around 400 elite LTTE troops are believed to have set off in the dark by boat from Pooneryn, on the opposite side of the Jaffna lagoon, before landing at Ariyalai and Thanankilappu.</p> <p>\"It was a classic pincer movement,\" one analyst said. \"They simply went around the left flank. The LTTE [now] have numerous options. They are highly motivated and extremely well trained,\" he added. \"The question is whether the Sri Lankan army troops will stand and fight.\"</p>",

The town itself remained firmly in Sri Lankan army control, officials said. \"[The Tigers] have breached the line but now we are consolidating in the area,\" a military spokesman, Brigadier Palitho Fernando, said. \"Of course this is a fast-changing situation. The fighting is still going on.\" Military sources last night said that Navatkuli bridge was now in no-man's land - between rebel positions dug in to the east of the bridge, and government forces to the west. Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) troops were also trying to infiltrate into Jaffna, they added. The Sri Lankan information ministry claimed that suicide attackers - many of them women and children - had taken part in the offensive. \"Terrorists continued to fire a heavy volume of artillery and mortars. Troops fought back effectively, repulsing a number of human waves of the attackers,\" a government statement added. The attack came 24 hours after Sri Lanka's president, Chandrika Kumaratunga, flatly rejected a temporary ceasefire offer by the Tigers to allow the 40,000 Sri Lankan troops marooned in Jaffna to evacuate. The rebels had warned that rejection would lead to \"disastrous consequences\". In a statement from its London headquarters, the Tigers yesterday said that their commando units launched a massive offensive on three fronts in the early hours of yesterday morning, attacking Sri Lankan army bases at Thanankilappu, Ariyalai and Navatkuli. The rebels described yesterday's attack as part of an ongoing operation dubbed \"Unceasing Waves 3\". The operation, which began in November, has seen the Tigers make their most spectacular gains since they lost Jaffna and much of northern Sri Lanka to a government advance in 1995. On April 22 they seized Elephant Pass, a key military base and gateway to the peninsula. Ten days ago they seized a second military base at Palali, before scaling back hostilities while Indian diplomats secretly tried to broker a ceasefire. Government forces had expected the rebels to continue their attack on Kilaly, a naval base 14 miles from Jaffna, close to the rebel front line. Instead, around 400 elite LTTE troops are believed to have set off in the dark by boat from Pooneryn, on the opposite side of the Jaffna lagoon, before landing at Ariyalai and Thanankilappu. \"It was a classic pincer movement,\" one analyst said. \"They simply went around the left flank. The LTTE [now] have numerous options. They are highly motivated and extremely well trained,\" he added. \"The question is whether the Sri Lankan army troops will stand and fight.\"",

The flesh, in this case, is your own. In a discovery set to have holiday beaches smelling like a foodie's kitchen this summer, Japanese scientists have found that applying virgin olive oil to the skin after sunbathing protects against skin cancer. A team led by Masamitsu Ichihashi of Kobe University decided to try the olive oil treatment after realising that it was rich in a set of substances called antioxidants. Antioxidants, which include vitamins E and C, can mop up a pernicious type of molecule called a free radical, which can damage cells and genes. Free radicals are generated naturally by the body's absorption of oxygen but they are also created by the ultraviolet radiation in sunlight, which in turn can lead to skin cancer. The latest edition of New Scientist magazine reports that the Kobe team tanned hairless mice under a sunlamp three times a week. Shortly after the tanning sessions some of the mice were painted with regular olive oil and some with virgin oil. After 18 weeks under the sun lamp, unoiled mice and those treated with regular oil began to develop skin tumours. The virgin oil mice did not show any sign of cancer for a further six weeks, and when they did, the tumours were smaller and fewer. Their skin had also suffered less genetic damage. The Japanese researchers do not propose that olive oil is useful as a sunscreen, but say that the results in mice suggest it could help protect against skin cancer from the sun if applied after tanning. The report is a further boost to the olive oil industry, already a beneficiary of the north European fad for high quality Mediterranean ingredients and evidence that olive oil can help protect against heart disease.

He straddles the ground between party moderates and the religious right who, as his biographers say, \"get more sermons than blood, sweat or policy out of Bush\", and yet still support him.

Ann Clwyd, Labour MP for Cynon Valley, said nose, stomach and breast operations by David Herbert, of Southwell, Nottinghamshire, had generated a huge number of complaints. \"The dossier of evidence I have about him is as gruesome as it is wrong,\" she said, using parliamentary privilege to launch a scathing attack on a surgeon whose own colleagues, she said, had described him as a psychopath. He had been dubbed \"the flying doctor\" because of \"the speed with which he carries out his surgery and the brief time he spends with patients. \"He carries out 35 surgical procedures a week and he carries out a face lift in just 40 minutes.

The list of allegations and complaints goes on and on. \"It is just incredible that this man should be continuing to operate given the complaints against him.\" Yesterday Mr Herbert, a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England and co-founder of the British Associ ation of Cosmetic Surgeons, was operating at the Cromwell Clinic in Huntingdon. In a statement released through the Medical Protection Society he said the complaints had come as a great shock and that he would consult his lawyers. \"I have been a cosmetic surgeon since 1978 and have always done everything I could to achieve the best possible result for every one of the many patients I have treated during that time.\" The General Medical Council confirmed last night that it had received a large number of complaints about Mr Herbert and was pursuing them \"as urgently as the present law allows\". The council was investigating him under \"pattern of poor performance\" procedure rather than isolated incidents of misconduct. \"The performance procedures allow us to assess a doctor when there is evidence of seriously deficient performance and where necessary to suspend the doctor or to impose conditions.\" But the council had no power to suspend a doctor being considered for investigation under the performance procedures. \"You don't need a qualification in plastic surgery to become a plastic surgeon.\" The Royal College of Surgeons said it had no powers to discipline Mr Herbert because he worked entirely in private practice. Mr Herbert, 62, is said to be a pioneer of the scar-free facelift. He trained in London and Edinburgh and has worked in plastic surgery units in Liverpool and Birmingham. He now operates at clinics in Nottingham, Preston and London in addition to Huntingdon and deals with up to 1,300 patients a year. In February he told the Not tingham Evening Post that he had had \"fewer than eight\" complaints. \"In this country, about 4% or 5% of people are unhappy with their surgery based on a plastic surgeon who does no more than 150 cases a year.

      "bodyText": "Russia attacked Nato for its Kosovo policy yesterday at the first meeting between senior military officers since relations were ruptured over last year's war in the Serbian province. General Anatoly Kvashnin, the chief of the Russian general staff, complained before starting talks at alliance headquarters in Brussels that Nato was not doing enough to protect Serbs from attacks by ethnic Albanians. \"No positive signs can be seen in the situation,\" he said. \"Nato is trying to present a better picture than actually exists.\" Gen Kvashnin's remarks cast a cloud over what Nato had hoped would be the resumption of friendly relations with Moscow, and came amid Serb protests. In Kosovo, Serbs demonstrated in the ethnically mixed northern town of Mitrovice, demanding speedy trials for jailed friends and relatives. \"We are aware of the problems regarding Kosovo's judicial system,\" the local Nato commander, French Brigadier General Pierre de Saqui de Sannes, told the protesters, alluding to a backlog of cases awaiting trial because of lack of personnel and inadequate legislation. In Belgrade, the families of several hundred missing Kosovo Serbs held a march demanding that their loved ones be released or at least accounted for. Several Serbs were yesterday reported wounded in a grenade and machinegun attack in Cernica, an ethnically-mixed town 20 miles south-east of Pristina. Alliance leaders acknowledge that violence remains a serious problem in Kosovo, but insist there has been some progress in achieving peace. Russia opposed the bombing of Yugoslavia and its relations with Nato were effectively frozen until February. Russian troops serve alongside the Nato-led K-For peacekeeping troops, but Moscow remains on good terms with the regime of President Slobodan Milosevic. Meanwhile, the European commission yesterday announced a revamp of its aid efforts to Kosovo by cutting red tape and speeding up delivery. Chris Patten, the external relations commissioner, warned that if the EU wanted to be taken seriously in foreign policy it must back up words with deeds. \"We cannot go around making huge spending promises to people unless we put it in the budget,\" he said. \"I'm embarrassed by the size of the gap between committed and spent aid.\" The EU is footing half the bill for reconstructing Kosovo, because the US paid most of the cost of the war.

That may not in itself be a reason for Britain to feel responsible for what happens, but it is one reason for Sierra Leoneans to hope that she will. Yet this British government has been bruised by Sierra Leone before. Had it cared to take the lesson, the promise to restore Ahmad Tejan Kabbah to power in 1997, and the arms-to-Africa scandal that followed, was an early example of the old truth that wishing a result is not the same as obtaining it. When Robin Cook began to appear decisive and commanding this week, there was an unmistakable whiff of old ghost to be laid. The peace agreement imposed with British and US backing in July last year is another, more serious case of wishful thinking. Foday Sankoh - or Vice-President Foday Sankoh as he became after the Lome peace accord - has been committing atrocities in Sierra Leone for more than 10 years and was a prime candidate for a war crimes tribunal. But it was easier, then, to give Sankoh an amnesty and make him minister of mines. It is easy to blame the United Nations and certainly the UN has an almost unique capacity to generate overpaying jobs that permit under-performing bureaucrats to enjoy first world comfort in third world countries. But the UN is little more than the sum of its parts and the resolve of the UN can be nothing more than the collective will of its key members. Just as the UN failure in Rwanda was our failure, so the Unamsil (UN mission) failure in Sierra Leone is our failure too. But what is it that has failed? Is it the idea of peacekeeping, or our commitment to it? The rhetoric says we will intervene wherever there is a humanitarian need. Reality suggests that we will do so in selected, relatively small countries in which we can argue both a strategic or humanitarian imperative and the possibility of a result. The evidence is building, though, that even that limited commitment is beyond us. Two previous African interventions are relevant here: Somalia, where 18 American and 24 Pakistani soldiers died; and Rwanda, where, after the grisly murder of 14 Belgian peacekeepers, the UN abandoned the Tutsi population to its fate. The decisions now taken on intervention in Africa are weighed against this history and seem to be informed by two principles: that it is unacceptable to stand by while civilians are butchered, and that white lives must not be lost in any attempt to prevent it. In Sierra Leone, Britain and the US backed last July's peace agreement and voted for the UN peacekeeping force, but refused to participate in it. The result - an ill trained, under strength and ill equipped force with a mission to enforce a non existent peace - suggests another question. Is the effort to save democratic government and bring peace to Sierra Leone important or is it not? If it is, then should it not be done properly? If it is not, then should it be done at all? There is an argument that says that conflict only ends - and peace only comes - when one side or the other wins the war. Yet to send heavyweight fighting forces is a political impossibility, since so many voters are, on the whole, unwilling to see their young men die keeping the peace in a country they cannot find on the map. So what are the alternatives? One is to let the war happen, however painful, then to go in when it is over and salve the international conscience by rebuilding the hospitals and schools and bandaging the wounds of the survivors. The other is to intervene on the side that we think is in the right, to try to hasten the victory. These are not pretty choices, but the experience of recent years suggests that they are realistic. We could evacuate the UN peacekeepers and leave Sierra Leone to fight it out, hoping that the government side will win and the hostages will be rescued, but keeping a shady deal handy in case the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) wins. There would be costs: abject humiliation for the United Nations (something that unfortunate body is more than used to); and of course, the risk that a mass murderer might end up as dictator of Sierra Leone. But if we were prepared to give Sankoh an amnesty and the diamond mines instead of the death sentence he would otherwise have faced last year, allowing him the whole country does not seem such a big step. There would be a cost in the lives of the people, including those who have fled to Freetown to escape the advancing RUF (the last time the RUF had the upper hand, 6,000 people were butchered). And finally, if the UN forces have to flee, the next casualty would be the UN hopes of intervention in the far more complicated and intractable war in the Democratic Republic of Congo. If the experience of Sierra Leone is anything to go by, a pause for reflection there might not be a bad thing. A second option is to use the fact that the British have secured the airport to reinforce Unamsil while negotiating the return of the Nigerian troops who were the only force who managed to keep the RUF at bay and the semblance of a peace intact. Robin Cook's formulation of the British forces role - that they will not be fighting as part of the UN forces in Sierra Leone - is characteristically ambiguous. But whatever fighting the paras find themselves in, neither Robin Cook nor Tony Blair is likely to wish them to remain in Sierra Leone for long enough to get a result. Propping up the UN forces is fine in the short term, but I think we know by now that, even at the best of times, UN forces cannot bear much weight.

Bernard Alapetite, the chief executive of Platypus, a Paris publishing company, was found guilty of copying foreign child porn videos - some featuring rapes of boys under 15 and young children having sex with animals - and selling them for between \u00a380 and \u00a3100 each. Fifty-one other men who were found with child sex videos in their homes received suspended sentences ranging from two to six months. The case followed an unprecedented police crackdown in 1997 which prompted widespread alarm at the extent of paedophilia in France. More than 2,500 police searched 800 homes, questioned 700 men and detained 300 suspects, finally bringing charges against 61. Elsewhere in France, more than 100 unrelated paedophile cases were opened following the two-day operation, codenamed Ado 71. Several hundred more men were arrested for \"receiving objects obtained by means of the corruption of minors\". Six were also charged with child rape. But the operation also led to public concern at a \"name them and shame them\" policy that saw five suspects commit suicide immediately after being released from custody. The Human Rights League said the mass arrests were \"scandalous round-ups, an anti-paedophile witch-hunt\", while the justice minister, Elisabeth Guigou, asked whether such a \"spectacular series of coups\" was necessary or appropriate. Those on trial included priests, doctors, lawyers, a managing director, a tax inspector, a banker, a pharmacist, a bus driver, a scriptwriter and an advertising executive. Aged between 30 and 92, all had bought child porn videos from a mail order company in Macon in the central region of Burgundy. The youth and sports minister, Marie-George Buffet, was subsequently forced to promise tougher controls in schools, youth clubs and summer camps after several teachers were among those in the dock. But while Mr Alapetite had numerous previous convictions for similar offences, his clients either strongly protested their innocence or broke down during the court case last March as they tried to express their remorse. The case raised questions about definitions of paedophilia in French law: half the suspects were in court for being in possession of one video.

      "body": "<p>It begins like chaos theory. A butterfly beats its wings in Norfolk as polar bear cubs die of the heat in Alaska. Conurbations of coral are bleached white in the Maldives while a tiny toad, as golden as sunflowers, disappears forever into the clouds of Costa Rica. In a natural world as densely diverse as ours, it could just be the ecological equivalent of fractals - evolution erasing species and making way for more. Only it isn't. </p> <p>\"We changed the world too fast and left it behind\", was just one of the perversely poetic moments in <strong> Warnings From The Wild</strong> (BBC2), a frighteningly comprehensive and comprehensively frightening Nature Special. Showing there is nothing chaotic about the appearance of 22 species of butterflies from southern Europe in Norfolk and the disappearance of some 50 species of frog and toad in the Monteverde Cloud Forests, it joined the dots and presented a picture of a world being slowly strangled by global warming. </p> <p>While we were bombarded with statistics - the 1990s were the warmest decade since records began, 1998 the warmest year ever; ice cover in the Arctic has been reduced by three to five per cent per decade; since 1860, there has been a 33 per cent rise in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere - which were all very sobering, it was the images of Warnings From The Wild which hammered home the gravity of global warming. Fish danced over albino coral cities paled by El Ni\u00f1o, swallows swimming in the English spring air made it summer, and polar bears waited patiently for death. </p> <p>And while the extinction of some frogs in a faraway place may be considered by some as a tiny footnote in the book of the world, the extreme weather, the social and agricultural dislocation, and the spread of disease which will also result from global warming made the fate of the golden toad a warning for us all. A lucid, unsensational piece of television, its message was clear. Unless we act, the world will end with neither a whimper nor a bang but with the steady drip-drip-drip of melting ice. Comfortable viewing, this wasn't. </p> <p> <strong> The Body Hunter</strong> (BBC1) was equally challenging. Following Chief Inspector Martin Hemingway from south Yorkshire to southern Kosovo, it charted a month in the search for the disappeared ethnic Albanians of the war-torn region. </p> <p>Hemingway and his team spent their time both digging in suspected mass graves for bodies and searching their humanity for the fortitude to continue, for the sake of justice and for the sake of those grieving in Kosovo. \"It is desperately disrespectful, but we are trying our best\", Hemingway explained over and over. By finding bodies, Hemingway's team were trying to give the people whose relatives were missing some peace of mind. The team themselves however had no peace (\"We have to separate. Put it in a little box...\" an army major said with haunted eyes), but continued their grim task with a sense of duty alien to most of us. </p> <p>Yet hammering home the horror of Kosovo with the fiercest impact was the recurring idea that so much evil occurred amid such ordinariness. In a shopping centre, a whole family were executed. A wedding video recorded the last gloriously happy day of a gathered clan. Tonka-yellow diggers uncovered bags and bags of rotting human meat. Grandchildren had to identify their grandmother's body by the cardigan she was wearing when she was herded off.

      "bodyText": "It begins like chaos theory. A butterfly beats its wings in Norfolk as polar bear cubs die of the heat in Alaska. Conurbations of coral are bleached white in the Maldives while a tiny toad, as golden as sunflowers, disappears forever into the clouds of Costa Rica. In a natural world as densely diverse as ours, it could just be the ecological equivalent of fractals - evolution erasing species and making way for more. Only it isn't. \"We changed the world too fast and left it behind\", was just one of the perversely poetic moments in Warnings From The Wild (BBC2), a frighteningly comprehensive and comprehensively frightening Nature Special. Showing there is nothing chaotic about the appearance of 22 species of butterflies from southern Europe in Norfolk and the disappearance of some 50 species of frog and toad in the Monteverde Cloud Forests, it joined the dots and presented a picture of a world being slowly strangled by global warming. While we were bombarded with statistics - the 1990s were the warmest decade since records began, 1998 the warmest year ever; ice cover in the Arctic has been reduced by three to five per cent per decade; since 1860, there has been a 33 per cent rise in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere - which were all very sobering, it was the images of Warnings From The Wild which hammered home the gravity of global warming. Fish danced over albino coral cities paled by El Ni\u00f1o, swallows swimming in the English spring air made it summer, and polar bears waited patiently for death. And while the extinction of some frogs in a faraway place may be considered by some as a tiny footnote in the book of the world, the extreme weather, the social and agricultural dislocation, and the spread of disease which will also result from global warming made the fate of the golden toad a warning for us all. A lucid, unsensational piece of television, its message was clear. Unless we act, the world will end with neither a whimper nor a bang but with the steady drip-drip-drip of melting ice. Comfortable viewing, this wasn't. The Body Hunter (BBC1) was equally challenging. Following Chief Inspector Martin Hemingway from south Yorkshire to southern Kosovo, it charted a month in the search for the disappeared ethnic Albanians of the war-torn region. Hemingway and his team spent their time both digging in suspected mass graves for bodies and searching their humanity for the fortitude to continue, for the sake of justice and for the sake of those grieving in Kosovo. \"It is desperately disrespectful, but we are trying our best\", Hemingway explained over and over. By finding bodies, Hemingway's team were trying to give the people whose relatives were missing some peace of mind. The team themselves however had no peace (\"We have to separate. Put it in a little box...\" an army major said with haunted eyes), but continued their grim task with a sense of duty alien to most of us. Yet hammering home the horror of Kosovo with the fiercest impact was the recurring idea that so much evil occurred amid such ordinariness. In a shopping centre, a whole family were executed. A wedding video recorded the last gloriously happy day of a gathered clan. Tonka-yellow diggers uncovered bags and bags of rotting human meat. Grandchildren had to identify their grandmother's body by the cardigan she was wearing when she was herded off. Not until then did I realise the full horror of what went on in Kosovo; the anaesthetic provided by the same news reports over and over again suddenly worn off. In King Of The Hill (C4), Peggy was head-to-nearly-toes in plaster after a parachuting accident, dim Didi had given birth and kept forgetting where she left the baby, and Bobby was left to care for it. In the end, an incapacitated Peggy calmed the crying baby, soothed a guilt-ridden Hank and gave viewers a cosy thought. Who would have thought such a misanthropic cartoon would provide such comfort? And speaking of two-dimensional characters, Gail had a dinner party in Coronation Street (ITV) in an attempt to matchmake Gary \"The Mullet\" Mallet and Rebecca, unaware that Rebecca was at it with Mr Gail, Spindly Martin.

      "body": "<p>At 5pm today at the American Craft Museum in New York, bidding will begin for Suprematist Composition by Kasimir Malevich. This is the first painting by Malevich to be auctioned on the open market since the artist's death in 1935, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to acquire an important work by one of the founding fathers of abstract art. Rumours vary as to what it will fetch, but \"it's got to be worth $15m\", says Howard Rutkowski of the auctioneers, Phillips. </p> <p>The sale comes after six years of negotiations between the Museum of Modern Art in New York and Malevich's heirs, who last June received the painting plus $5m in an out-of-court settlement as compensation for the museum's \"appropriation\" of 21 works, including Suprematist Composition. Alfred Barr, a former director of MoMA, bought four works and borrowed another 17 in 1935, and when the man who lent Barr the works died in 1957, the labels saying \"on loan\" changed. However, it is only since the fall of the Soviet Union that the Malevich family has been able to file a claim, and it still has several lawsuits pending, notably against the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam. In 1958 the Stedelijk, which has the best Malevich collection outside Russia, paid $29,000 for 36 works, but there are doubts as to whether those who sold it the works were authorised to do so. If the Malevich family's claim is successful, the sums involved could dwarf those in the case against MoMA. </p> <p>Kasimir Malevich was born in Kiev in 1878, and studied art there and later in Moscow; his main contribution to 20th-century art came in December 1915, when he exhibited a roomful of Suprematist works in St Petersburg, then called Petrograd. The paintings feature geometric planes of colour suspended in infinite white space, conveying dynamic spatial relations by minimal but forceful means. The painting being auctioned today was executed in 1919 and 1920, by which time Malevich was a leading figure in the new Soviet artistic establishment, and Suprematism, with its austere but iconoclastic energy, had all but become the official revolutionary school of painting. </p> <p>In the spring of 1927 Malevich travelled to Berlin to take part in the Grossek\u00fcnstausstellung, where he was due to exhibit around 70 paintings, drawings and architectural models. At this time it was becoming increasingly difficult for Russian avant-garde artists to work freely, and Malevich used the trip to investigate the possibility of emigrating. In April he went to the Bauhaus in Dessau to try to get a teaching post, but his German wasn't up to scratch and Walter Gropius, the director of the school, eventually had to refuse. Disappointed, Malevich left Germany on June 6, almost four months before the Berlin exhibition was due to finish, and left his works in the care of his friend Hugo H\u00e4ring. </p> <p>Malevich clearly hoped to return one day, and left no precise instructions as to what was to happen to the works if he didn't come back. But Stalin's lieutenants were entrenching themselves in all spheres, and Malevich was arrested and interrogated for several days in 1930, his correspondence with H\u00e4ring abruptly cut off. </p> <p>In Germany, meanwhile, the Nazis were targeting \"degenerate art\". H\u00e4ring, fearing for the works' safety, left them in the care of Alexander D\u00f6rner, the director of the Hanover Museum. It was from D\u00f6rner that Barr borrowed several Malevich works in 1935, and it was D\u00f6rner who took one painting and a drawing with him when he emigrated to America in 1938; these two works are held in the Busch-Reisenger Museum, which still has them but in December acknowledged the Malevich family's ownership. </p> <p>Malevich died of cancer in May 1935, and after his death his family were scattered across the Soviet Union. In the words of Clemens Toussaint, a German art historian who has been instrumental in the Malevich family's claim, the family \"had to run for their lives\", moving to provincial towns in Russia, Ukraine and Turkmenistan to avoid Stalin's purges. Malevich's works were not exhibited again in the Soviet Union until 1962. In the early 90s, Toussaint was contacted by Malevich's granddaughter, Ninel Bychkova, and he set about the task of locating Malevich's surviving descendants. In all, Toussaint found 31 descendants from Malevich's three marriages, including not only those still in the former USSR but also others in Canada, Poland and the UK. A few family members will be at the auction today. </p> <p>Toussaint and the Malevich estate presented their case to Lawrence M Kaye of New York lawyers Herrick, Feinstein LLP, who specialise in the repatriation and recovery of art. Speaking on behalf of the Malevich estate, Kaye says that the family believe the success of their claim to be \"a justified triumph\", adding: \"It is important for the international community of art collectors and museum curators to have the opportunity to compete for the first time for a Malevich.\" Howard Rutkowski of Phillips, however, notes that although he \"would love to see it go to a museum, unfortunately there are very few with those kind of finances\", and Suprematist Composition is more likely to go to a European or American collector. </p> <p>Toussaint describes the MoMA case as \"a long, hard adventure\". Even now, nine years after the collapse of the USSR, the Malevich estate is the first from the former Soviet Union to claim works in the west, and Toussaint seems sceptical about the possibility of still more avant-garde heavyweights resurfacing. \"It's now more a question of re-establishing legal relations between countries than re-establishing the avant-garde,\" he says, pointing out that there are more than a million and a half objects in Russia - largely those taken from Germany by the Red Army in 1945 - whose fate remains unresolved. </p> <p>Marian Douma of the Stedelijk Museum calls the repatriation of art \"a question for Europe\", referring to so-called trophy art, Nazi thefts and even the Elgin marbles. Indeed, today's auction marks more than the restitution of a family's heritage, since Malevich's works followed a tortuous route through totalitarian terror, a world war and emigration. Not only is Suprematist Composition an icon of 20th-century art; it stands for the dislocations and dispossessions of 20th-century history.</p>",

      "body": "<p>It has been a bad week for doctors. First came a report from an NHS investigation in Staffordshire, which found doctors pursuing clinical trials on babies using totally inadequate procedures for obtaining informed consent from parents. In the words of Lord Hunt, health minister in the Lords and a former health manager, it documented the need for a cultural change in the NHS with a shift in the balance of power towards patients. Then came yesterday's interim report, produced by the Bristol Royal Infirmary inquiry, into the removal of hundreds of organs from dead children across the country without parental knowledge or consent. Professor Ian Kennedy, chairman of the inquiry, spoke yesterday of the \"professional arrogance\" of doctors, who had produced \"a social and ethical time bomb waiting to go off. It is no surprise that the explosion of anger, when it came, was huge.\" Now our health correspondent reports that the British Medical Association, which in the wake of Bristol was ready to accept revalidation - testing of a doctor's continued fitness to practise - is backtracking; one reason why yesterday's report is so timely. </p> <p>To be fair to modern medics, attitudes are changing. The conservative profession has been forced to change, not least because of the huge increase in information now available to patients. But it is not just the web. Sir Cyril Chantler, dean of London's largest medical school, set out other reasons why doctors had to become more open: \"Medicine used to be simple, ineffective and relatively safe. It is now complex, effective and potentially dangerous. The mystical authority of the doctor used to be essential for practice. Now we need to be open and work in partnership with our colleagues in health care and with our patients.\" </p> <p>Professor Kennedy recognised the conflict of interests between doctors wanting organs to help advance medical care and parents expecting to be properly consulted about their dead children. He rightly rejects the idea that this is irremediable. The aim should be to see consent as a process, giving parents time to reflect and recognise the needs of medical science. The report sets out an enforceable new code, calls for an end to the separate rules governing hospital and coroners' post-mortem examinations and insists on the new procedure being open and honest. A profession intent on restoring public trust will back not just these proposals but revalidation too.</p>",

To be fair to modern medics, attitudes are changing. The conservative profession has been forced to change, not least because of the huge increase in information now available to patients. But it is not just the web. Sir Cyril Chantler, dean of London's largest medical school, set out other reasons why doctors had to become more open: \"Medicine used to be simple, ineffective and relatively safe. It is now complex, effective and potentially dangerous. The mystical authority of the doctor used to be essential for practice. Now we need to be open and work in partnership with our colleagues in health care and with our patients.\" Professor Kennedy recognised the conflict of interests between doctors wanting organs to help advance medical care and parents expecting to be properly consulted about their dead children. He rightly rejects the idea that this is irremediable. The aim should be to see consent as a process, giving parents time to reflect and recognise the needs of medical science. The report sets out an enforceable new code, calls for an end to the separate rules governing hospital and coroners' post-mortem examinations and insists on the new procedure being open and honest. A profession intent on restoring public trust will back not just these proposals but revalidation too.",

Twenty-five years ago, when he last prowled the turbine hall of Tate Modern, it was a fully-functioning 300 megawatt oil-fired power station, helping to quench London's burgeoning thirst for energy, and Dennett, now 67, was its manager. </p> <p>It is the noise - its omnipresence then, and its absence now - that he notices first. Every day, he walked the length of the turbine hall to the control room to check that everything was running smoothly. \"The turbines were grinding away, there were people everywhere,\" he remembers. \"Walking the building, talking to everyone - it was the only way to get a sense of how things were going on. You had to go and look, and feel, and smell.\" Like all the power stations he worked in, he says, there was \"an immense smell of oil and grease\". </p> <p>Today, the handful of frenzied security guards and black-polo-necked denizens of the art world scuttling across the hall do so silently; the predominant smell is of expensive perfume. The intervening platforms have been ripped out and the huge space is dominated by Louise Bourgeois's three bronze towers, echoing the turbines Dennett inspected daily. </p> <p>He shows more gratitude for what has remained than sadness at what has gone. \"Now, look at this ducting,\" he exclaims with relish, almost backing into C\u00e9zanne's Still Life With Water Jug (1892-3) and eliciting audible gasps from gallery attendants. \"They're using it as the ventilation system, but we had to walk everywhere on it. That's why women were frightened to go round the plant, because people could see their knickers.\" </p> <p>It took 16 years to build Bankside, from Sir Giles Gilbert Scott's initial design to its opening in 1963 - by which time London was crying out for it. The capital's power requirements were doubling almost twice a decade, and no adequate technology had yet been developed to transport electricity from out-of-town sites. \"People look at this building today and they say, 'What the hell does anybody want to put a power station in the middle of London for?' But after the war, demand was tremendous, and you just had to build the supply near the demand.\" </p> <p>Much of the Bankside manager's working life was spent waiting for the call from the National Grid to say that the station's power was required to meet a surge in demand. The Miss World contest was always a particularly stressful time - everyone would switch on their kettles simultaneously, and energy requirements would skyrocket. The night BBC2 was launched, Battersea power station, just down the road, gave up the ghost completely. It was a night recalled with shudders by station managers for years afterwards. </p> <p>That was all a long time ago, Dennett says, and it's hard to remember exactly what was where - but there's still a sense of belonging, an air of proprietorialism, evident in his manner. He spots Sir Nicholas Serota gliding past. \"I think you've done a marvellous job, keeping all these signs of what the building used to be,\" he tells the Tate director warmly, rather as if he was congratulating one of his engineers on a particularly impressive piece of handiwork. Sir Nicholas looks genuinely enchanted, but it's time to move on. </p> <p>\"This was the boilerhouse, generating steam to feed the turbines,\" Dennett explains, gesturing at Tate Modern's ultra-trendy shop, its tables piled high with glossy art books and gallery sweatshirts. And it is still the boilerhouse, in some sense, he says. \"It's good that they've kept the girders, the rusty ductwork, the dirty bricks: there's a relationship to the plant as it was.\" </p> <p>The gallons of Thames water required to cool the plant flowed in roughly at a point now occupied by a particularly confusing installation by Peter Fischli and David Weiss, designed to give the impression of being a room of the gallery still under construction, littered with the detritus of a building site. \"Peter Fischli and David Weiss delight in the clutter of brightly coloured consumer products that surrounds us all,\" says an explanatory notice. \"I have to say, I prefer classical art,\" says Dennett. </p> <p> By the time the plant was decommissioned in 1981, Dennett had moved on, to a career that traced the development and fracturing of the British energy industry: first to work on developments in nuclear power, masterminded from offices just over the road from Bankside; then several years spent closing down other city-centre power stations as technology rendered them obsolete. It was a job requiring a lot of sensitivity, he says, and it's nice to see a decommissioned building getting a new lease of life instead. \"The most exciting things you usually see in our industry are chimney stacks being exploded and falling to the ground.\" </p> <p>Dennett retired in 1992, to an active life in Rotary Club affairs and a house in Cheam, where he lives with his wife Joan. It was sad to see Bankside go, but it was never going to last, he says: it wasn't long before one modern 660 megawatt turbine could outstrip the station's entire set, and still have spare capacity left over. \"There was a lot of dedication to duty here, from the lowest labourer through the craftsmen to the engineers,\" he remembers. \"But I've never been a person for wanting to live in the past. I don't believe in dwelling on things, on going and meeting people at pensioners' dos and saying 'Oh, wasn't it wonderful?' and all that. You've got to move on.\"</p>",

The researchers identified a gene that carries the blueprint for a protein that acts as a receptor for a chemical in the brain, substance P. This turned out to be one of the messengers of pleasure in opium-based drugs. Opiates are the only drugs strong enough to alleviate the pain of many cancer patients. If they could be administered with a second drug which blocked the substance P receptor, there would be less risk of dependency.",

Two men, who deny causing the jumbo jet disaster, are alleged to have caused a suitcase containing an umbrella, clothing and an improvised explosive device concealed within a radio cassette recorder to be placed on board Pan Am flight 103. The device allegedly detonated on board the aircraft on December 21 1988 killing all 259 passengers and crew and 11 Lockerbie residents. The hearing at Camp Zeist in the Netherlands was told how 64-year-old Gwendoline Horton, from Morpeth, Northumberland, scoured fields with her husband for debris after the plane was blown out of the sky above Lockerbie. She said she found a document, about eight inches long by eight inches wide, with writing on it which referred to a radio cassette player. \"We went out with the specific idea of collecting this stuff and my neighbour had said to hand it to the police.\" A retired police constable, Brian Walton, of Northumbria police, told how Mrs Horton handed the item to him at his station in Alnwick.

Last year Luminar bought 27 bars and nightclubs from Allied Leisure for \u00a334.5m, including the Hippodrome and Camden Palace. Allied had itself recently acquired those venues through its takeover of European Leisure. Luminar's executives include Tony Marshall, the former managing director of Butlins. Luminar shares yesterday fell by 22.5p, to 747.5p at the start of trading in London, while Northern Leisure rose as much as 13.5p, to 174p. The all-share deal would result in a company pressing for entry into the FTSE 250 Mid Cap group of stocks.",

Trained as a mechanic, he worked in a garage in the 1930s, but his real passion was motor-cycle racing. In 1937 he was the French motor-cycle racing champion and in 1938 he won the world record for the distance covered in 24 hours.</p> <p>Jarrot was taken prisoner during the fall of France, but escaped almost immediately and returned to his home in Burgundy. Jarrot's garage in Lux was just inside the unoccupied zone, and he started working for a network smuggling people - especially escaped prisoners of war and allied aviators who had been shot down - across the Demarcation Line dividing occupied and unoccupied France. In the first two years of the Occupation, he assisted over 4,000 people in this way.</p> <p>In 1942, after being briefly arrested by the Germans, he decided to head for London, where he arrived in the spring of 1943 after various vicissitudes (including a period of incarceration in the notorious Spanish internment camp of Miranda). In London, Jarrot was given training in sabotage by the Gaullist section of the Special Operations Executive and was parachuted back into France as one of two leaders of the \"Armada\" sabotage mission. Over the following months, Armada carried out an extraordinary number of operations, including the destruction of power stations in the Burgundy area, the destruction of the Le Creusot industrial plant (which the RAF had failed to destroy in 1942), the immobilisation of numerous canals, the destruction of power cables (187 pylons were brought down on one day in October 1943), and the breaching of the Grigny barrage near Chalon.</p> <p>Of Jarrot's multifarious Resistance activities, the most important was the disruption of the water transportation system of much of north-eastern and central France at a time when the Germans were trying to send torpedo boats and submarines to disrupt the imminent allied landings in Italy. By immobilising the canal traffic between the Ruhr and the Mediterranean at such a crucial moment, the Armada mission contributed significantly - possibly decisively - to the success of the allied landings at Anzio and Salerno. The official historian of the SOE rightly described the contribution of the Armada mission as the most \"striking demonstration of the sabotage possibilities of clandestine warfare\" and \"the most remarkable instance in France of sabotage directed to serve a strategic end\".

But not all resisters followed identical political trajectories. Jarrot had been on the left in the 1930s, but after the war loyalty to de Gaulle became his guiding principle. When in 1947 de Gaulle set up his Rally of the French People (RPF), Jarrot became regional organiser for the department of the Sane-et-Loire; in 1953 he was elected RPF mayor of Lux; in 1958, he was a founder member of the Union for the Republic (UNR), set up to support de Gaulle's action as president.</p> <p>Jarrot, however, was never a front rank - or even a second rank - politician. His political career centred on the Sane-et-Loire, for which he was elected deputy in 1958. Having been mayor of Lux since 1953, he was elected instead in 1965 to be mayor of the larger community of Montceau-les-Mines in the same area. Jarrot only emerged from his local role in May 1974, when he was chosen by the newly elected centre-right president Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing as minister for the quality of life.</p> <p>The choice of Jarrot was Giscard's attempt to enhance his reputation among Gaullists - all the more necessary since his family's Vichyite past gave Giscard an ambiguous reputation among former resisters, whereas his rival Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was seen as having good Resistance credentials. For this reason, once the Gaullist candidate Chaban Delmas had been knocked out of the race, even some conservative resisters preferred Mitterrand to Giscard.

      "body": "<p>Henry Bird, who has died in hospital in Northampton at the age of 90, was an artist who had worked, for the past 50 years anyway, mainly for the adornment of his native county. One of his paintings, for Matthew Holding's late Victorian Guildhall, showed the muses contemplating Northampton, and though they must on frequent occasions have had to cover their eyes at some of the changes in the town, they would have been pleased, one suspects, with the contribution of such a talented and indefatigable, if often catankerous, follower.</p> <p>Henry regarded talent as an obligation and he served his own with exemplary devotion. He could not understand people who appeared to take art less seriously. Many regretted their hastily expressed opinion too late in the face of one of his uncompromising rebuffs. His late wife, the actress Freda Jackson, viewed her own art with similar rigour and both of them tended to disdain small talk. Taking a chair between them in Hardingstone House, their home on the edge of Northampton, could be a bit like sitting on the anvil while the blacksmith was at work. It was a testing experience that survivors valued enormously, perhaps just as much, in retrospect, as the great kindness of which both Henry and Freda were capable.</p> <p>Henry Bird was born in the Green Street area of Northampton, near St Peter's church and the gasworks. His father had been a baker who, disillusioned after his return from the first world war, committed suicide. His mother came from a family of shoemakers at a time when the smell of leather, the town's daily bread, must have been permanently in the air. They were poor and it was a poor environment which Henry never forgot, but it was not unredeemed. Henry became a chorister in the Norman church, and once said that the beauty of St Peter's capitals, and the skill with which they were carved, helped to point the way to the kind of life he wanted.</p> <p>He was only 11 when he began to study part time at the art school, taking factory and office jobs to pay his way. Encouraged by the principal, Lewis Duckett, he took the government certificate in drawing and painting, was placed in the first six in England and Wales, and gained a scholarship to the Royal College of Art, where he won most of the big prizes, including a travelling scholarship. The single-minded dedication that was necessary to bring about such a translation was central to Henry's character and therefore never left him.</p> <p>Some of the early influences, such as Frank Brangwyn and Tiepolo, perhaps never left him either. What he never came to terms with was the declining value placed upon the academic skills which he had worked so hard to acquire, not only in the world at large but also, he felt, at the Royal College itself.</p> <p>After the Royal College, and a period in which, among other things, he painted a number of inn signs, he became, in 1936, a lecturer in art history at the University College of Wales in Aberystwyth. His knowledge of art history was deep and constantly increasing throughout his life (he never willingly missed Ernst Gombrich's lectures at the Warburg Institute, for instance, and I still feel indebted to him for introducing me to them). He was especially illuminating on artists with whom he felt an affinity - Rubens for example, whose plump women he particularly admired.</p> <p>Very soon after he took up the Aberystwyth appointment, which he held for five years, he and Freda Jackson married. They had met at Northampton Repertory Theatre, now The Royal (incorporated in the Derngate centre), where the company had included Errol Flynn, with whom Freda was reputed to have had a relationship. Indeed, Freda is said to have remarked, as a joke, that she chose Henry because he was so plain and unlikely to be lured away from her by another woman; or perhaps the story originated with Henry. They were, in any case, devoted to each other - even if the relationship sometimes seemed to outsiders perplexingly antagonistic - and their admiration for each other's work was unflagging.</p> <p>Their careers ran in parallel for some time. Henry became a scene painter in charge of the studio producing sets for the Old Vic and Sadler's Wells. Then he became the resident designer at the Embassy Theatre until, in 1950, he returned to Northampton to take up a teaching post at the school of art. His classes became legendary. He believed that drawing was the bedrock of art, but before his pupils were allowed to test their aptitude for life drawing, his real passion, he would confront them with an ordinary building brick, and say, \"First, draw that.\" Students were sometimes reduced to tears.</p> <p>For Henry, sound craftsmanship was the springboard for everything else: if you were not prepared for the necessary application to acquire it, then that was that. His belief in academic skills and qualifications sometimes caused damaging and long-lasting personal conflicts. One of these was with David Gommon, whose appointment as art master at Northampton Grammar School he opposed because Gommon had, to begin with, no conventional qualifications, although he had been rightly praised as a practising artist. Much distress was caused before this was resolved. They lived at opposite ends of the same village and both taught until they reached retirement age, keeping well away from each other.</p> <p>Henry painted a number of substantial mural schemes in the area, in the chapel of St Crispin Hospital (a psychiatric hospital) at Duston, near Northampton, at Danetre Hospital, Daventry, and at Denton Church, in Northamptonshire, where many of the villagers were included among other friends who acted as models for more than 30 figures in this ambitious scheme of the mid 1970s. A major mural was his fire curtain for the Royal Theatre in Northampton, which included a series of vignette portraits among whom were Freda and, on the opposite side of the proscenium, Errol Flynn.</p> <p>Henry probably saw himself principally as a mural painter, but his drawings, his life drawings, may come to be seen as his best work. He had a studio right in the centre of Northampton, up several flights of stairs in an attic above the Northampton and County club. It had a huge slanting light suggesting a set for La Boh\u00e8me, providing a view of the tower and cupola of All Saints church (where his memorial service was held).</p> <p>Whatever quips he directed at his own appearance, it did not deter a long succession of models, almost all women, who tramped up the stairs to strip and pose for him.

      "bodyText": "Henry Bird, who has died in hospital in Northampton at the age of 90, was an artist who had worked, for the past 50 years anyway, mainly for the adornment of his native county. One of his paintings, for Matthew Holding's late Victorian Guildhall, showed the muses contemplating Northampton, and though they must on frequent occasions have had to cover their eyes at some of the changes in the town, they would have been pleased, one suspects, with the contribution of such a talented and indefatigable, if often catankerous, follower. Henry regarded talent as an obligation and he served his own with exemplary devotion. He could not understand people who appeared to take art less seriously. Many regretted their hastily expressed opinion too late in the face of one of his uncompromising rebuffs. His late wife, the actress Freda Jackson, viewed her own art with similar rigour and both of them tended to disdain small talk. Taking a chair between them in Hardingstone House, their home on the edge of Northampton, could be a bit like sitting on the anvil while the blacksmith was at work. It was a testing experience that survivors valued enormously, perhaps just as much, in retrospect, as the great kindness of which both Henry and Freda were capable. Henry Bird was born in the Green Street area of Northampton, near St Peter's church and the gasworks. His father had been a baker who, disillusioned after his return from the first world war, committed suicide. His mother came from a family of shoemakers at a time when the smell of leather, the town's daily bread, must have been permanently in the air. They were poor and it was a poor environment which Henry never forgot, but it was not unredeemed. Henry became a chorister in the Norman church, and once said that the beauty of St Peter's capitals, and the skill with which they were carved, helped to point the way to the kind of life he wanted. He was only 11 when he began to study part time at the art school, taking factory and office jobs to pay his way. Encouraged by the principal, Lewis Duckett, he took the government certificate in drawing and painting, was placed in the first six in England and Wales, and gained a scholarship to the Royal College of Art, where he won most of the big prizes, including a travelling scholarship. The single-minded dedication that was necessary to bring about such a translation was central to Henry's character and therefore never left him. Some of the early influences, such as Frank Brangwyn and Tiepolo, perhaps never left him either. What he never came to terms with was the declining value placed upon the academic skills which he had worked so hard to acquire, not only in the world at large but also, he felt, at the Royal College itself. After the Royal College, and a period in which, among other things, he painted a number of inn signs, he became, in 1936, a lecturer in art history at the University College of Wales in Aberystwyth. His knowledge of art history was deep and constantly increasing throughout his life (he never willingly missed Ernst Gombrich's lectures at the Warburg Institute, for instance, and I still feel indebted to him for introducing me to them). He was especially illuminating on artists with whom he felt an affinity - Rubens for example, whose plump women he particularly admired. Very soon after he took up the Aberystwyth appointment, which he held for five years, he and Freda Jackson married. They had met at Northampton Repertory Theatre, now The Royal (incorporated in the Derngate centre), where the company had included Errol Flynn, with whom Freda was reputed to have had a relationship. Indeed, Freda is said to have remarked, as a joke, that she chose Henry because he was so plain and unlikely to be lured away from her by another woman; or perhaps the story originated with Henry. They were, in any case, devoted to each other - even if the relationship sometimes seemed to outsiders perplexingly antagonistic - and their admiration for each other's work was unflagging. Their careers ran in parallel for some time. Henry became a scene painter in charge of the studio producing sets for the Old Vic and Sadler's Wells. Then he became the resident designer at the Embassy Theatre until, in 1950, he returned to Northampton to take up a teaching post at the school of art. His classes became legendary. He believed that drawing was the bedrock of art, but before his pupils were allowed to test their aptitude for life drawing, his real passion, he would confront them with an ordinary building brick, and say, \"First, draw that.\" Students were sometimes reduced to tears. For Henry, sound craftsmanship was the springboard for everything else: if you were not prepared for the necessary application to acquire it, then that was that. His belief in academic skills and qualifications sometimes caused damaging and long-lasting personal conflicts. One of these was with David Gommon, whose appointment as art master at Northampton Grammar School he opposed because Gommon had, to begin with, no conventional qualifications, although he had been rightly praised as a practising artist. Much distress was caused before this was resolved. They lived at opposite ends of the same village and both taught until they reached retirement age, keeping well away from each other. Henry painted a number of substantial mural schemes in the area, in the chapel of St Crispin Hospital (a psychiatric hospital) at Duston, near Northampton, at Danetre Hospital, Daventry, and at Denton Church, in Northamptonshire, where many of the villagers were included among other friends who acted as models for more than 30 figures in this ambitious scheme of the mid 1970s. A major mural was his fire curtain for the Royal Theatre in Northampton, which included a series of vignette portraits among whom were Freda and, on the opposite side of the proscenium, Errol Flynn. Henry probably saw himself principally as a mural painter, but his drawings, his life drawings, may come to be seen as his best work. He had a studio right in the centre of Northampton, up several flights of stairs in an attic above the Northampton and County club. It had a huge slanting light suggesting a set for La Boh\u00e8me, providing a view of the tower and cupola of All Saints church (where his memorial service was held). Whatever quips he directed at his own appearance, it did not deter a long succession of models, almost all women, who tramped up the stairs to strip and pose for him. His drawings were always accomplished, and the good ones exhilaratingly so. A debilitating sweetness, when he allowed the drawing to become too decorative, sometimes prevailed. This was cut somewhat after the first Egon Schiele exhibition at the Marlborough gallery, which I saw with him, sometime in the 1960s, I think - a show that excited him greatly. Henry carried on making the ascent to draw in his studio until he was too frail for the climb and his eyesight had failed to too great a degree. He received various honours: a civil list pension in recognition of his services to art, a certificate of appreciation from the town. He felt those things were his due. He was, as someone remarked at his memorial service, an institution. He leaves one son, Julian, a psychiatrist, and a granddaughter, Kate.",

He worked for three years on a medical relief project in the Sudan, after which he wrote a paper for the World Health Organisation. In the years prior to his arrest he travelled in Asia, spending much time in Thailand where he had planned to work as an English teacher. A series of letters written from jail reveal Mr Chell's increasing frustration and disappointment as the case has appeared to turn against him. In a letter to Ms Shaw written while he was still in handcuffs after one hearing, he said: \"Sensational developments following Karpal's brilliant cross-examination of arresting officer yesterday ... lies and destruction of evidence shown up in court.\" But in an 18-page letter received at the end of April after he was ordered to present his defence the optimism appeared to have drained away. \"Henry Cooper, ex-British boxing champion, once said about fighting in Italy that you had to knock your opponent out to get a draw. I rather fancy that might be an approriate analogy ... there's no use hiding the fact that my chances have deteriorated considerably now.\" Mr Singh echoes his client's gloomy outlook: \"It has become very difficult now. If the judge is willing to accept such tarnished evidence, we will have to work very hard to prove he is innocent,\" he said.",

      "bodyText": "Sir Richard Branson has been forced to apologise for the heavy-handed threats made by his lawyers to companies that use the trade name Virgin. Sir Richard, who is launching his new Virgin Blue service as Australia's third domestic airline, has been accused of bullying small companies by telling them they could not use the name \"Virgin\" even if they had already registered it with state authorities and were not direct competitors. The furore over the company name began when several small firms were told by Coudert Brothers, the law firm retained by Virgin, that they had 14 days to disconnect their phones and hand over stationary for destruction. The letters asked the firms to give an irrevocable written undertaking to stop using the Virgin name and pay the costs of the legal letter. \"We got a bill basically saying 'Please remit $500 for the cost of our solicitor preparing this document to insult you',\" said Mark Kanard, the chief pilot of Virgin Helicopters, which has traded under the name since 1998. The owner of Virgin Wheel Repairs, Mr Steve Wiessner, who has been operating under the name in west Sydney for three years, said the threat to disconnect phones and faxes would have meant the closure of his company, which employs eight people. He failed to see how his business could be in competition with the entertainment and aviation giant.

In a further blow to public relations, it was discovered that Virgin's travel website has rubbished some of Australia's best-loved tourist attractions and insulted Brisbane, the site of Virgin Airlines' new regional headquarters. The Queensland state government, which wooed Virgin with a \u00a34m incentive package, was furious to see the website describe Brisbane as a \"hick\" town until the 1970s which is not worth flying halfway across the world to see.

Unions described the news as \"terrible\", suggesting that their worst fears about the deal could be realised. </p> <p>In a joint announcement, the two companies said their global headquarters would be in a new facility at Brentford, Middlesex, which SmithKline Beecham began building last year. </p> <p>SmithKline's nearby head offices, New Horizons Court and SB House, will be shut, as planned. However, additional casualties will include the company's pharmaceuticals centre in Welwyn Garden City - originally the headquarters of the group's predecessor, SmithKline &amp; French. </p> <p>A SmithKline spokesman said: \"It sounds like a lot but we were going to shut some of these anyway. We had a team which looked at things very carefully. What we need is state-of-the-art accomodation in new facilities.\" </p> <p>A modern Glaxo Wellcome building at Stockley Park, near Heathrow airport, London, will become the base of the combined company's UK pharmaceuticals operation. </p> <p>Glaxo's old headquarters at Greenford will be turned into a site for research and development. </p> <p>Both companies refused to comment on likely job losses in the upheaval. Many more redundancies are likely when manufacturing operations are combined. </p> <p>The Manufacturing, Science and Finance Union believes the deal as a whole could cost 5,000 jobs in the UK. An MSF spokesman said: \"We were saying this deal was a doomsday scenario for a lot of workers when it was first announced. People told us we were wrong but clearly, we weren't.\" </p> <p>Casualties among Glaxo's sites will include leased offices in Slough, Ealing Broadway, Southall and Stockley Park Lakeside. </p> <p>SmithKline's central London town house in Chester Square, which boasts a spacious flat for the group's chief executive, will be axed in favour of Glaxo's similar site in Berkeley Square. </p> <p>Between them, the two groups employ 16,000 people in Britain. The tie-up has triggered fears in political circles that jobs could be moved overseas, particularly in vital research areas. </p> <p>Particularly controversial has been a decision to locate Glaxo SmithKline's operational headquarters in New York. This will oversee day-to-day running of the business, while the official Brentford \"corporate headquarters\" will largely deal with administrative matters, such as finance, human resources and information technology. </p> <p>The two groups have promised to keep open both their research and development sites - in Stevenage and Harlow. However, Smith Kline's chief executive, Jean-Pierre Garnier, told MPs at a select committee hearing in February: </p> <p>\"We are businessmen. Clearly, if there is a dramatic change to the environment in Britain, you would not expect us to stay.\" </p> <p>The deal was nodded through on Monday by the European commission, on condition that the two groups sell drugs worth \u00a350m, including treatments for herpes, nausea and smoker's cough.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham are to close seven of their 10 administrative sites in the south-east, as part of their forthcoming \u00a3118bn merger to form the world's largest pharmaceuticals company. The closures will mean hundreds of job losses and these could be just the tip of the iceberg by the time all the merger plans are carried through. Unions described the news as \"terrible\", suggesting that their worst fears about the deal could be realised. In a joint announcement, the two companies said their global headquarters would be in a new facility at Brentford, Middlesex, which SmithKline Beecham began building last year. SmithKline's nearby head offices, New Horizons Court and SB House, will be shut, as planned. However, additional casualties will include the company's pharmaceuticals centre in Welwyn Garden City - originally the headquarters of the group's predecessor, SmithKline &amp; French. A SmithKline spokesman said: \"It sounds like a lot but we were going to shut some of these anyway. We had a team which looked at things very carefully. What we need is state-of-the-art accomodation in new facilities.\" A modern Glaxo Wellcome building at Stockley Park, near Heathrow airport, London, will become the base of the combined company's UK pharmaceuticals operation. Glaxo's old headquarters at Greenford will be turned into a site for research and development. Both companies refused to comment on likely job losses in the upheaval. Many more redundancies are likely when manufacturing operations are combined. The Manufacturing, Science and Finance Union believes the deal as a whole could cost 5,000 jobs in the UK. An MSF spokesman said: \"We were saying this deal was a doomsday scenario for a lot of workers when it was first announced. People told us we were wrong but clearly, we weren't.\" Casualties among Glaxo's sites will include leased offices in Slough, Ealing Broadway, Southall and Stockley Park Lakeside. SmithKline's central London town house in Chester Square, which boasts a spacious flat for the group's chief executive, will be axed in favour of Glaxo's similar site in Berkeley Square. Between them, the two groups employ 16,000 people in Britain. The tie-up has triggered fears in political circles that jobs could be moved overseas, particularly in vital research areas. Particularly controversial has been a decision to locate Glaxo SmithKline's operational headquarters in New York. This will oversee day-to-day running of the business, while the official Brentford \"corporate headquarters\" will largely deal with administrative matters, such as finance, human resources and information technology. The two groups have promised to keep open both their research and development sites - in Stevenage and Harlow. However, Smith Kline's chief executive, Jean-Pierre Garnier, told MPs at a select committee hearing in February: \"We are businessmen. Clearly, if there is a dramatic change to the environment in Britain, you would not expect us to stay.\" The deal was nodded through on Monday by the European commission, on condition that the two groups sell drugs worth \u00a350m, including treatments for herpes, nausea and smoker's cough.",

You choose one of five different Jedi characters from Obi-Wan Kenobi to Adi Gallia, hack and slash your way through 10 sort-of-3D levels, and beat the boss at the end of each scenario. It's not an intellectual challenge, but the levels are probably big enough to keep you going until you need a hand transplant. </p> <p>The enemy droids are amazingly unobservant and will stand around for ages waiting for you to dismember them. However, they do have blasters, which is a bit unfair if you only have a light sabre. Luckily, they are very bad shots, and you can bat their bullets back at them, baseball style. You can also \"earn\" your own thermite bombs, shields, restraining bolts and so on. The best feature of the game is co-operative play: you and a mate against the Federation. If you enjoyed the arcade action-adventure games of the late Sinclair Spectrum/ Commodore 64 era, you'll probably like this. What's more, it also has terrific Star Wars music and better animations than the little stick-like figures familiar from the 80s - though not that much better. (JS)</p> <p><strong>It's big but it's certainly not clever</strong><br> Slave Zero<br> PC \u00a334.99 Infogrames <br> Miniaturisation is an underused perspective in computer games. Only Micro Machines and its myriad sequels have really delved into realms of Honey, I Shrunk The Video Game. Slave Zero goes the other way with cities dwarfed by your character, the 60ft bi-pedal robot of the title. </p> <p>Imagine King Kong in Metropolis and you're part way there. And, of course, you're not the only big bot in town with numerous oversized adversaries blocking the way to freedom. Cue mindless blasting, excessive destruction and oodles of fun.</p> <p>Well, not really. Fiddly controls make steering Zero harder than you'd expect, while the camera is particularly unhelpful. Likewise, the graphics are barely adequate, though the meaty explosions are worthy of praise. No, the real problem here is the questionable longevity of the game itself. Variety is distinctly lacking as you veer from city to boss baddie and back to the samey city level again. It's not long before the mindless stomping loses its appeal and your mind begins to wander.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, Slave Zero has been ported to the Sega Dreamcast, where it seems better suited than the stuffier environs of the PC games market. Ultimately, with so many top-notch games around, something so average doesn't seem worth bothering with. Still, if you fancy a quick blast then Slave Zero is willing and able to deliver. However, if you demand slightly more commitment from your gaming relationships then it's probably best to leave well alone. (GH)</p>",

You choose one of five different Jedi characters from Obi-Wan Kenobi to Adi Gallia, hack and slash your way through 10 sort-of-3D levels, and beat the boss at the end of each scenario. It's not an intellectual challenge, but the levels are probably big enough to keep you going until you need a hand transplant. The enemy droids are amazingly unobservant and will stand around for ages waiting for you to dismember them. However, they do have blasters, which is a bit unfair if you only have a light sabre. Luckily, they are very bad shots, and you can bat their bullets back at them, baseball style. You can also \"earn\" your own thermite bombs, shields, restraining bolts and so on. The best feature of the game is co-operative play: you and a mate against the Federation. If you enjoyed the arcade action-adventure games of the late Sinclair Spectrum/ Commodore 64 era, you'll probably like this. What's more, it also has terrific Star Wars music and better animations than the little stick-like figures familiar from the 80s - though not that much better. (JS) It's big but it's certainly not clever Slave Zero PC \u00a334.99 Infogrames Miniaturisation is an underused perspective in computer games. Only Micro Machines and its myriad sequels have really delved into realms of Honey, I Shrunk The Video Game. Slave Zero goes the other way with cities dwarfed by your character, the 60ft bi-pedal robot of the title. Imagine King Kong in Metropolis and you're part way there. And, of course, you're not the only big bot in town with numerous oversized adversaries blocking the way to freedom. Cue mindless blasting, excessive destruction and oodles of fun. Well, not really. Fiddly controls make steering Zero harder than you'd expect, while the camera is particularly unhelpful. Likewise, the graphics are barely adequate, though the meaty explosions are worthy of praise. No, the real problem here is the questionable longevity of the game itself. Variety is distinctly lacking as you veer from city to boss baddie and back to the samey city level again. It's not long before the mindless stomping loses its appeal and your mind begins to wander. Unsurprisingly, Slave Zero has been ported to the Sega Dreamcast, where it seems better suited than the stuffier environs of the PC games market. Ultimately, with so many top-notch games around, something so average doesn't seem worth bothering with. Still, if you fancy a quick blast then Slave Zero is willing and able to deliver. However, if you demand slightly more commitment from your gaming relationships then it's probably best to leave well alone. (GH)",

But if you sense some tension behind the smiles and offer of complimentary champagne, don't panic: it doesn't affect you. You're only going on one flight and it probably won't give you cancer. </p> <p>The cabin crew, on the other hand, spend a large proportion of their time absorbing cosmic radiation. In fact, only astronauts spend more hours in such close proximity to the hazardous high energy particles that rain down on earth from space. And that's why - to give just one example - Finnair stewardesses are excessively susceptible to developing breast cancer, bone cancer and leukemia. Cosmic radiation, which comes to earth from the sun and outer space, poses a very real danger to aircrews and frequent flyers. </p> <p>From this Saturday, European Union countries adopt new legislation about exposure to this source of \"natural\" radiation; the rules will mean that aircrew and frequent business flyers will be able to sue their employers if they are over-exposed due to too much time in the air. The dangers are particularly high at the moment because the sun is currently moving towards a peak in its activity. The solar atmosphere is a mass of charged particles at temperatures around 10 million Celsius , held in by magnetic fields that constantly shift around on the sun's surface. Occasionally, these fields rupture and the sun vomits billion ton clouds of particles. </p> <p>These \"coronal mass ejections\" can sustain speeds of a million miles per hour on their four-day journey to the earth. When they arrive, their radiation is powerful enough to knock out satellites and terrestrial power grids. A pilot encountering one of these bursts would probably receive his annual radiation dose in one day. But even without these spurts of intense solar activity, galactic cosmic rays are constantly creating showers of dangerous particles in the upper atmosphere. </p> <p>The density of cosmic radiation fields is highest at around 20km above sea level, but aeroplanes flying at altitudes of around 12km still encounter intense radiation, especially if they fly over the earth's magnetic poles. The earth's magnetic field funnels the charged particles into extremely high concentrations around the poles. So the flight path of a 747 heading to Japan, for example, is a trip through radiation hell, especially since that high-altitude radiation contains a large number of high energy neutrons. New research indicates that the biological damage caused by neutrons smashing into the body's cells may have been underestimated - hence the need for new safety limits. </p> <p>On average, naturally occurring radiation gives us an annual dose of 2.7 milliSieverts (mSv) per year. According to the International Commission on Radiation Protection, the risk of a fatal cancer from that dose is 1 in 7400; not negligible, but roughly four times less than the risk from smoking 10 cigarettes a day. But down on the ground the earth's atmosphere shields us from the hazardous neutrons. Working in the air can quadruple the radiation dose - and that dose is rich in neutron radiation. Any company that routinely exposes its workers to a radiation dose between one and six mSv per year over the background average is now obliged to individually monitor those workers, because their cancer risk is significantly increased. </p> <p>\"If you put a flight crew on polar routes all the time, they can get more than six mSv quite easily,\" says Michael Clark, scientific spokesman for the National Radiological Protection Board. Put six mSv on top of the background average, and the fatal cancer risk climbs to one in 2,300. And that's without considering the adverse effects of the increased neutron dose. </p> <p>But Clark is keen to keep things in perspective. \"If you stick a geiger counter in an aircraft you'd scare people to death, but getting 7 mSv does not mean you're going to die.\" </p> <p>To be safe, however, airlines have to put crews onto a variety of flight paths, keeping their radiation exposure down. That has cost implications: if you've invested in training someone to work on a jumbo, you don't really want them doing too many short-haul flights. British Airways, who collaborated in the study that led to the new legislation, currently use a computer program that works out the radiation doses likely to be received on each flight. </p> <p>\"We put their rosters and doses into the program, and the crew members can go into the system and find out what dose they've received,\" says David Flower, an aviation doctor with BA. </p> <p>Using the program, the company makes sure that the crews aren't consistently rostered onto high exposure flights. Pregnant cabin crew are automatically given ground duties. </p> <p>That's all very well for airline employees, but frequent flyers, not protected by rest periods and trade union laws, can be exposed to even more radiation than aircrew. </p> <p>\"Some frequent flyers approach radiation levels of astronauts on the space station,\" says Clive Dyer, who researches the effects of radiation at the Defence Research Agency in Malvern. Despite what the airlines might claim, high levels of radiation are hitting and affecting planes and everything in them, Dyer says. Cancer is not the only risk: aircraft electronics are also affected by the radiation. As microelectronics makes devices smaller and smaller, it takes fewer electrical charges to influence pieces of data in a computer memory, for example. Cosmic rays hitting the cockpit electronics can flip digital bits from 0 to 1, or vice-versa, resulting in instrument errors. Large doses can even trigger electrical currents that burn out devices. </p> <p>But airlines are still able to play down the effects of the radiation on aircrew because the sample groups available for studies are too small for rigorous analysis. The only statistic that is widely accepted across the industry is that very many pilots develop skin cancer, confirmed by a report in the Lancet last December. </p> <p>But, the report's authors pointed out, these tended to occur on the torso and limbs.

      "body": "<p>Chances are, on your way to work you were pressed up against some people on the tube. Or maybe you passed a dozen parents taking their kids to school. Or perhaps you cycled past three office blocks and a row of shops. </p> <p> Did you notice what those people looked like? What they were wearing? How many different kinds of fruit were stacked outside the fourth shop in the row? What the colour of the lobby carpet is in your office? Most of the time we are unaware of many details of the world around us. Our eyes are not selecting what is salient; rather we are choosing what to pay attention to in the blooming, buzzing, confusion about us. It is as if a switch has been flicked preventing certain visual information from reaching the conscious part of our brains. Now new research by Dr Robert Desimone from the US National Institutes of Health in Bethesda seems to indicate exactly how we do it. </p> <p> What intrigued Desimone was how we spot a face in a crowd. Confronted with a school photo, or a mass of people waiting outside the arrivals lounge at Heathrow, we almost immediately spot the person we are looking for. We scan a vast amount of information, but pay attention almost exclusively to the salient cue, the face we are searching for. To try and determine how we do it, he trained a monkey to respond to a picture of an object - a flower, for instance. When it did, it was given a food reward. The monkey was then presented with an array of objects and had to find the flower as quickly as possible: a task analogous to finding the face of a friend in a crowd. </p> <p> Desimone monitored the electrical impulses in the monkey's brain cells, or neurones. He found that certain neurones responded to the flower, while others responded to different objects. When the monkey was waiting to see the array of objects, the neurones that responded to the flower were already showing heightened electrical activity even though the monkey was not looking at anything. As soon as the array appeared, these neurones became more active; the brain cells which responded to the other objects started to fire, but quickly became inactive. This happened even before the monkey moved its eyes to look at the flower. It is as if the monkey's brain was primed and ready to respond to the image it was waiting for, and any other signals from competing objects were suppressed: the monkey may not even have been aware of them. </p> <p> In this experiment, the monkey had actively been trained to spot the flower, but what happens when we have no image to look out for - when we walk into an office crowded with people, printers, and piles of paper? Desimone trained a monkey to look at a screen with a red bar and a yellow bar.

      "bodyText": "Chances are, on your way to work you were pressed up against some people on the tube. Or maybe you passed a dozen parents taking their kids to school. Or perhaps you cycled past three office blocks and a row of shops. Did you notice what those people looked like? What they were wearing? How many different kinds of fruit were stacked outside the fourth shop in the row? What the colour of the lobby carpet is in your office? Most of the time we are unaware of many details of the world around us. Our eyes are not selecting what is salient; rather we are choosing what to pay attention to in the blooming, buzzing, confusion about us. It is as if a switch has been flicked preventing certain visual information from reaching the conscious part of our brains. Now new research by Dr Robert Desimone from the US National Institutes of Health in Bethesda seems to indicate exactly how we do it. What intrigued Desimone was how we spot a face in a crowd. Confronted with a school photo, or a mass of people waiting outside the arrivals lounge at Heathrow, we almost immediately spot the person we are looking for. We scan a vast amount of information, but pay attention almost exclusively to the salient cue, the face we are searching for. To try and determine how we do it, he trained a monkey to respond to a picture of an object - a flower, for instance. When it did, it was given a food reward. The monkey was then presented with an array of objects and had to find the flower as quickly as possible: a task analogous to finding the face of a friend in a crowd. Desimone monitored the electrical impulses in the monkey's brain cells, or neurones. He found that certain neurones responded to the flower, while others responded to different objects. When the monkey was waiting to see the array of objects, the neurones that responded to the flower were already showing heightened electrical activity even though the monkey was not looking at anything. As soon as the array appeared, these neurones became more active; the brain cells which responded to the other objects started to fire, but quickly became inactive. This happened even before the monkey moved its eyes to look at the flower. It is as if the monkey's brain was primed and ready to respond to the image it was waiting for, and any other signals from competing objects were suppressed: the monkey may not even have been aware of them. In this experiment, the monkey had actively been trained to spot the flower, but what happens when we have no image to look out for - when we walk into an office crowded with people, printers, and piles of paper? Desimone trained a monkey to look at a screen with a red bar and a yellow bar. What he discovered was that many neurones fire; the electrical activity from brain cells responding to the red bar are in competition with those reacting to the yellow as both groups attempt to suppress the other. The total signal is muddied and weak: in an office we would see a general melee of people, printers and paperwork, but we would not notice anything in particular. If the monkey is now trained to respond to the yellow bar, these neuronal signals become stronger and suppress the ones that respond to the red bar - as if we had suddenly noticed a bright pink piece of paper, or the pencil we had been searching for. \"Attention seems to be biased towards what's important,\" says Desimone. \"Attention modulates suppression, it turns off the response to other stimuli.\" This same mechanism appears to work in humans as well as monkeys. Desimone presenting people with objects to look at whilst he scanned their brains. Their brains hardly responded. He then asked them to pay attention to what they were looking at. Immediately there was strong electrical activity. Finally, he showed them a blank screen but asked them to pay attention to the pictures he was about to show them.

It could grow into the most valuable company in the world: I can see it on every device. They have 120m subscribers to their service and they're basically providing whatever that number ask for. They could be the monster of this decade. The E-cademy can be found at: www.theecademy.com",

The model sports 32Mb of embedded memory which will deliver around half an hour of music. It goes on sale in June. </p> <p>Also coming in the next couple of months is Samsung's first Wap phone, the SGH-A110, and a high-end model laden with personal organiser style facilities called the SGH-A100. </p> <p>Ericsson will also soon be offering MP3 tunes via its mobile phones. At Mobilexpo it touted an MP3 add-on for several of its current models. Users won't have to worry about missing calls - when the phone rings the music automatically cuts out. The player goes on sale in July. </p> <p>Among Ericsson's other major launches this summer is a rival for its heavyweight R250 PRO water, shock and dust resistant phone, tested in Online recently. </p> <p>The new model, the R310, is said to be as tough as its predecessor, yet is significantly smaller and boasts extra facilities like voice control and data/fax capabilities.

It boasts that its 6250 is the first shock, dust and water resistant phone to feature a built in Wap browser (for maybe checking football scores when you are skiing?). </p> <p>Also due soon is a conventional Wap phone, the 6210 and the 8890 Nokia's first model that is compatible with American GSM networks. Another Wap debut came from French company Sagem, which is bringing its Internet-friendly MW930 model to the UK in the next couple of weeks. </p> <p><strong> Card battles</strong> The battle for supremacy in the high-speed, high storage memory card arena has shifted up a gear this week. Panasonic has announced Japanese launch dates for the first of its products that use an SD (Secure Digital) card - the main rival to Sony's already available Memory Stick. Due in June is the SV-SD70, a personal audio player compatible with both MP3 and the emerging audio format AAC. It will be joined later in the summer by SD-compatible PCs and email machines. Panasonic hopes SD, which it developed in collaboration with Toshiba and SanDisk, will become the standard storage system for solid-state audio players, digital cameras, mobile phones and portable data terminals. Initial cards will be able to store 64Mb of information. However, the trio is confident that a 1 gigabyte card will be available by 2002. Panasonic is expected to announce UK launch dates for SD products next week.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong> Handspring's history </strong><br> In 1992, Jeff Hawkins was developing applications for a new generation of pen-operated computers. But early systems were so poor he decided to develop something better, and with Donna Dubinsky and Ed Colligan, set up Palm in 1994. Palm was taken over by US Robotics in September 1995, and shipped its first machines in April 1996. But US Robotics was itself bought by 3Com in June 1997 and the Palm Pilot was renamed the 3Com Palm. The trio decided to leave for \"an independent environment\", licensed the Palm operating system from 3Com, and co-founded Handspring in July 1998. </p> <p> Palm's dominant market share of the palmtop computer market could be wiped out in a year or two, and the company's original founders could be just the people to do it. The core group responsible for the Palm Pilot left to start up a rival called Handspring, and last week, they continued their assault with the European launch of their rival machine, the Visor. </p> <p>\"The product's done incredibly well in the States,\" says Ed Colligan, Handspring co-founder and marketing man. \"We've been in retail for about three weeks now, and we seem to be taking about 50% of the sales at the locations we're in. It's nothing short of amazing.\" </p> <p>However, this is not necessarily bad news for Palm, because Handspring is using the PalmOS operating system and paying a royalty on each machine it sells. Palm is trying to avoid the mistakes made by companies such as Apple, which kept its Macintosh operating system proprietary, restricted competition, charged high prices, and only narrowly avoided being driven out of business. By licensing its software, Palm is giving consumers more choice and, it hopes, stimulating the growth of a larger market with room for all. </p> <p>Donna Dubinksy, Handspring's co-founder and chief executive, admits that \"it's hard to find examples of companies that license their technologies and then compete with their licensees: when I was at Palm, I had a strategy of licensing complementary products.\" However, it may turn out to be a product-based business rather than a platform business like the PC industry, which Microsoft is trying to replicate with its Windows CE/Pocket PC palmtop strategy. </p> <p>Colligan certainly thinks so. \"It's not going to be a winner-take-all game,\" he says. \"There's not going to be one device that everyone loves, or one operating system.

      "bodyText": "Handspring's history In 1992, Jeff Hawkins was developing applications for a new generation of pen-operated computers. But early systems were so poor he decided to develop something better, and with Donna Dubinsky and Ed Colligan, set up Palm in 1994. Palm was taken over by US Robotics in September 1995, and shipped its first machines in April 1996. But US Robotics was itself bought by 3Com in June 1997 and the Palm Pilot was renamed the 3Com Palm. The trio decided to leave for \"an independent environment\", licensed the Palm operating system from 3Com, and co-founded Handspring in July 1998. Palm's dominant market share of the palmtop computer market could be wiped out in a year or two, and the company's original founders could be just the people to do it. The core group responsible for the Palm Pilot left to start up a rival called Handspring, and last week, they continued their assault with the European launch of their rival machine, the Visor. \"The product's done incredibly well in the States,\" says Ed Colligan, Handspring co-founder and marketing man. \"We've been in retail for about three weeks now, and we seem to be taking about 50% of the sales at the locations we're in. It's nothing short of amazing.\" However, this is not necessarily bad news for Palm, because Handspring is using the PalmOS operating system and paying a royalty on each machine it sells. Palm is trying to avoid the mistakes made by companies such as Apple, which kept its Macintosh operating system proprietary, restricted competition, charged high prices, and only narrowly avoided being driven out of business. By licensing its software, Palm is giving consumers more choice and, it hopes, stimulating the growth of a larger market with room for all. Donna Dubinksy, Handspring's co-founder and chief executive, admits that \"it's hard to find examples of companies that license their technologies and then compete with their licensees: when I was at Palm, I had a strategy of licensing complementary products.\" However, it may turn out to be a product-based business rather than a platform business like the PC industry, which Microsoft is trying to replicate with its Windows CE/Pocket PC palmtop strategy. Colligan certainly thinks so. \"It's not going to be a winner-take-all game,\" he says. \"There's not going to be one device that everyone loves, or one operating system. It will be more like the cellphone business, where people will care more about form and function and ease of use. But from our perspective, boy, there's a lot of running room before we start fighting over single market share points.\" Handspring has targeted one of the Palm machine's main weaknesses: it's poor expandability. As well as the Palm's personal organiser software - addressbook, to-do list, clock, calendar, calculator - the Visor includes a Springboard expansion slot. This will let users plug a wide range of useful modules into the back. So far, Springboard has generated impressive support: more than a dozen modules were demonstrated at the London launch.

While this may be a good argument against the \"Windows or nothing\" approach often taken by people - and firms - who should know better, a thought comes to mind. What will happen when someone pens a virus that attacks the Linux-based devices now being launched, or WAP browsers or Psions? </p> <p>Is there any protection available for the growing \"non-standard\" brigade of net appliances? </p> <p><strong> Chris Emery</strong> </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:chrisdemery@chrisdemery.fsnet.co.uk\">chrisdemery@chrisdemery.fsnet.co.uk</a> </p> <p><strong> Ideal model </strong><br> Douglas Rushkoff's interesting article on modelling (Online, May 4) contained some inaccuracies which detract from his thesis. </p> <p>It would be more accurate to refer to a typewriter and a word-processing program as models of an ideal document processor. Both have subsets of the features that one might want. Models can be physical as well as programmatic. </p> <p>Word processing (and HTML) are both programming activities. Typing \"a\" in a Word document (for example) is an instruction to insert (usually) character #97 of the current font in the compiled document at the current point and move on by the character width. HTML is a language with which to give formatting instructions. Both languages may be restrictive compared with what Douglas regards as \"real\" programming languages, but languages they are. </p> <p><strong> Bob Margolis</strong> </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:bob@margolis.freewire.co.uk\">bob@margolis.freewire.co.uk</a> </p> <p><strong> Mass force </strong><br> Can it be that there are two laws of physics? The article Snowballs of the Gods (Science, May 4) states that \"the law of physics makes a bigger hailstone fall faster\". </p> <p>Newton's Second Law has it that there is a bigger gravitational force on a bigger mass, yes, but a bigger mass needs more force to get it moving, so a bigger mass and a smaller mass end up with the same acceleration. </p> <p>This was famously demonstrated by Galileo dropping objects of different mass from the Leaning Tower of Pisa. More recently, the whole world watched it in a television shot from the moon when a golf ball and a feather were used. </p> <p>It could even happen that the bigger mass falls more slowly than the smaller one when one brings air resistance into it and the \"terminal velocity\" effect - this is a characteristic of the body's shape. Two parachutes of identical mass, one packed into a tight bundle and the other allowed to assume its full and proper shape will fall at vastly different speeds! </p> <p>Naturally when it comes to impact damage, assuming the two objects did reach the same velocity, that's where the difference shows. </p> <p><strong> George H Westgarth</strong> </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:ghwestgarth@cwcom.net\">ghwestgarth@cwcom.net</a> </p> <p><strong> Phone fury </strong><br> I think Ken Sawyer (Feedback, May 4) is remarkably restrained in his comments on the Lineone/Quip free call access. Since the end of March when I registered, Quip has reduced me to the state of fury and frustration with my computer I thought I'd outgrown some time ago. </p> <p>Apart from the fact he mentions, that one can't easily connect at all in the evenings or at weekends, I've been unable to make ordinary phone calls using the Quip gadget, which are part of the deal. The worst of it is the bland instruction to e-mail them with problems, when part of the problem is that you can't send e-mails. They say they will have improved access from May 15 but it'll have to be pretty good to make up for the waste of time and energy Quip has cost me so far. </p> <p><strong> Liz Moloney</strong> </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:liz.moloney@lineone.net\">liz.moloney@lineone.net</a> </p> <p><strong> Cam con </strong><br> I missed the original piece about Caroline Online, being out of the country at the time, but last November we set up honicam.com, the site of a camgirl called Honey in New Jersey. The homepage features an attractive blond who promises all sorts of excitement. Alas, when you click to see more, the book jacket for my novel Nine Mil (in which Honey and honicam.com are featured) pops up, with a link to Amazon.

This virus was apparently specific to PCs running Microsoft Windows. While this may be a good argument against the \"Windows or nothing\" approach often taken by people - and firms - who should know better, a thought comes to mind. What will happen when someone pens a virus that attacks the Linux-based devices now being launched, or WAP browsers or Psions? Is there any protection available for the growing \"non-standard\" brigade of net appliances? Chris Emery chrisdemery@chrisdemery.fsnet.co.uk Ideal model Douglas Rushkoff's interesting article on modelling (Online, May 4) contained some inaccuracies which detract from his thesis. It would be more accurate to refer to a typewriter and a word-processing program as models of an ideal document processor. Both have subsets of the features that one might want. Models can be physical as well as programmatic. Word processing (and HTML) are both programming activities. Typing \"a\" in a Word document (for example) is an instruction to insert (usually) character #97 of the current font in the compiled document at the current point and move on by the character width. HTML is a language with which to give formatting instructions. Both languages may be restrictive compared with what Douglas regards as \"real\" programming languages, but languages they are. Bob Margolis bob@margolis.freewire.co.uk Mass force Can it be that there are two laws of physics? The article Snowballs of the Gods (Science, May 4) states that \"the law of physics makes a bigger hailstone fall faster\". Newton's Second Law has it that there is a bigger gravitational force on a bigger mass, yes, but a bigger mass needs more force to get it moving, so a bigger mass and a smaller mass end up with the same acceleration. This was famously demonstrated by Galileo dropping objects of different mass from the Leaning Tower of Pisa. More recently, the whole world watched it in a television shot from the moon when a golf ball and a feather were used. It could even happen that the bigger mass falls more slowly than the smaller one when one brings air resistance into it and the \"terminal velocity\" effect - this is a characteristic of the body's shape. Two parachutes of identical mass, one packed into a tight bundle and the other allowed to assume its full and proper shape will fall at vastly different speeds! Naturally when it comes to impact damage, assuming the two objects did reach the same velocity, that's where the difference shows. George H Westgarth ghwestgarth@cwcom.net Phone fury I think Ken Sawyer (Feedback, May 4) is remarkably restrained in his comments on the Lineone/Quip free call access. Since the end of March when I registered, Quip has reduced me to the state of fury and frustration with my computer I thought I'd outgrown some time ago. Apart from the fact he mentions, that one can't easily connect at all in the evenings or at weekends, I've been unable to make ordinary phone calls using the Quip gadget, which are part of the deal. The worst of it is the bland instruction to e-mail them with problems, when part of the problem is that you can't send e-mails. They say they will have improved access from May 15 but it'll have to be pretty good to make up for the waste of time and energy Quip has cost me so far. Liz Moloney liz.moloney@lineone.net Cam con I missed the original piece about Caroline Online, being out of the country at the time, but last November we set up honicam.com, the site of a camgirl called Honey in New Jersey. The homepage features an attractive blond who promises all sorts of excitement. Alas, when you click to see more, the book jacket for my novel Nine Mil (in which Honey and honicam.com are featured) pops up, with a link to Amazon. I thought it was a neat idea, the Bookseller thought it was an inappropriate piece of marketing. Made me laugh, anyway. Rob Ryan 101510.756@compuserve.com",

In the basement, Lais Bodanski, a Brazilian film-maker, is editing her debut feature film. Designers, photographers, web wizards and video artists bounce ideas off one another. The editorial team of the Benetton magazine, Colors, is housed here. A cellist rehearses outdoors. You could hardly think of a more idyllic place to work. </p> <p>Fabrica is the brainchild of Oliveiro Toscani, who was, until the end of April, the Benetton Group's maverick photographer and advertising guru. He persuaded his patron, Luciano Benetton, to bankroll this \"permanent laboratory\" (Fabrica means factory in Latin) where young artists from all over the world are brought on scholarships to work on practical projects, both for Benetton and for outside clients. Imagine the kids from Fame transplanted to the Bauhaus and you'll get an idea of how the place runs. </p> <p>Despite the balmy surroundings, the atmosphere was strained on the morning I arrived. Three days before, it had been announced that Toscani and Benetton were ending their partnership. Nobody seems sure why he left, or, if they are, they're not saying. Elizabetta Prando, the administrator at Fabrica, suggests that Toscani (currently working in New York on Tina Brown's Talk magazine) simply wanted a change of scene. She doubts that the rupture was caused by Toscani's latest campaign featuring images of Death Row prisoners in the US: Luciano Benetton was well-accustomed to his protege stirring up mischief. Nevertheless, the timing of his departure is surprising. </p> <p>In September 1998, Toscani helped to launch Fabrica Cinema, a production company run by Marco Muller (director of the Locarno Film Festival). Its aim, Muller declares, is \"to make the films that are forbidden - to make films that nobody else would tackle because their subject matter raises hell\". Eighteen months later, Fabrica has a film - Samira Makhmalbaf's Blackboards - in the main competition at Cannes for the first time. </p> <p>I'm taken to Fabrica's impressive new underground extension (designed by Tadao Ando) to see some footage from Blackboards. The film looks extraordinarily powerful. Scripted by Makhmalbaf's father, Mohsen Makhmalbaf, it is an epic tale about three generations of displaced Kurds adrift in the mountains. Across the hallway is Lais Bodanski, whose film is based on a true story about a middle-class kid committed by his father to one of Brazil's notorious psychiatric asylums. Once inside, he can't get out. </p> <p>Fabrica Cinema, Muller explains, is Benetton's way of testing \"what kind of indirect publicity could be gained by investing money into a very special line of cultural film production\". Yes, Benetton can write-off the investment against tax, but he points out that few other clothing manufacturers would be prepared to pump money into movies that so openly court controversy. He cites Makhmalbaf's second feature as a case in point. Blackboards was shot without any approval from the Iranian authorities, on the border between Iran and Iraq. The print was not sent to the censorship office but was smuggled across the border. </p> <p>Fabrica's first crop of movies proved every bit as provocative as anything else that Toscani has been associated with. Yesim Ustaoglu's Journey to the Sun, a film about the plight of Kurds in Turkey, received its world premiere in Berlin on the day that PKK leader Ocalan was arrested. Zhang Yuan's Seventeen Years broke new ground by shooting inside a Chinese prison. It was banned by the Chinese authorities and refused an export licence, but nonetheless won the Best Director Award at the Venice Festival. And Muller touts Roger Gnoan M'bala's Adanggaman as \"the first African film to deal with the ultimate taboo subject - the collaboration of black African tribes in setting up the slave trade for the Portuguese\". Adanggaman has been delayed by the political upheaval in the Ivory Coast, but should be ready by the end of the year. </p> <p>Shortly before quitting Benetton, Toscani gave his blessing to a second series of Fabrica features. He stipulated that all the directors (like the other students/artists at Fabrica) should be under 25. Samira Makhmalbaf (whose first film, The Apple, screened in Cannes when she was only 17) fits the bill, as does Lais Bodanski. She and her producer Sara Silveira, can't believe their luck. \"For a Brazilian producer, it's a big chance,\" says Silveira. \"It opens our way to Europe and the rest of the world.\" </p> <p>The students at Fabrica are unanimous in their praise of Toscani. \"For me, he was the fire and passion of Fabrica,\" says Steven Lidbury, a 22-year-old English graphic designer who has been at Fabrica for two years. \"Without him, everything is headless. We're in a transitional period.\" </p> <p>The party line is that Luciano Benetton is still committed to Fabrica, with or without Toscani as the driving force behind it. \"Luciano wants us to be autonomous. But now he'll have to fight alone,\" Muller says, hinting that the Benetton boss (now in his 60s) may struggle to convince the rest of the board to support so offbeat an institution. \"In the past, he had Toscani as his spokesman. </p> <p>\"Have you heard about the revolution in Oakland?\" Muller asks. He claims that thousands of rioters recently took to the streets in the Californian city, and \"it took a very large military intervention to suppress this unrest\". Apparently, the insurrection was staged as a training exercise for the US military, who wanted to prove that they had the capacity to suppress a popular rebellion in less than a day. Gianfranco Rosi, another of Fabrica Cinema's batch of new directors, caught the entire event on camera. \"It is one of the most amazing war films you've ever seen,\" Muller enthuses. \"John Milius's Red Dawn was a fragment compared to this film.\" </p> <p>The battle sequences are the prelude to Rosi's Oakland Is Not for Burning, a film combining drama and documentary. Toscani was passionate about the project. The question that even Muller can't answer is whether Fabrica will be the same without him. \"Obviously somebody like Oliveira has such creative energy. He was at the centre of everything here...\" </p> <p>\u0095 Blackboards screens in competition at Cannes tomorrow and will be reviewed in Monday's arts section.</p>",
