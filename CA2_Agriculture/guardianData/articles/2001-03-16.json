As time went on they got a bit braver, but were still twice as unlikely to rebel as the men. Does that make them craven lobby-fodder and a general waste of bench-space? That depends on what you think MPs are for. Is rebellion against your own party the emblem of backbench effectiveness? \"Voting against your own party is one way to claim political virility and independence, but it doesn't get results,\" Fiona Mactaggart wrote in her Fabian pamphlet. (Rebellion is always rare: most MPs would fail if rebellion was the test).</p> <p>All the same, the women MPs behave differently. Why?

Confrontation seems to them an unproductive avenue to changing policy. Women in parliaments around the world tend to follow the same pattern of voting loyalty. They do politics differently - and perhaps better.</p> <p>Dr Sarah Childs, of Middlesex University in an academic study out shortly in Parliamentary Affairs, probes beyond the bare voting statistics. She interviewed new women MPs shortly after their arrival in Westminster in 1997 and again four years later, and assesses what effect their arrival has had on politics. Did they make a difference? She thinks they did. Only look at the budget to find their handiwork. Maternity pay, child care, part-time workers' rights, lone parents' new deal and a score of other recent measures did far more for women than for men. Ask women MPs and most will say: \"We did that.\" Do you imagine, they ask, that Gordon Brown had babies on his mind when he came to power? Poverty, yes, in the abstract, but without understanding that means women. Where are the manifesto commitments to most of the things that he has spent his money on? It was ex- single mother paymaster general Dawn Primarolo - in a key but silent, back-room post - who required the Treasury to calculate the gender effect of all its actions. (The last budget delivered an average \u00a3440 for women and \u00a3225 for men compared to 1997.) Women were not a central pitch back in 1997, but an afterthought and a disastrous afternoon's photo shoot with the prime minister. Remember how Tony Blair forgot to appoint a women's minister at all, calling Harriet Harman back in a hurry to add it to her brief?</p> <p>Dr Childs notes the changed self-confidence in the MPs since she first interviewed them. Most talk bitterly of their first blooding over the lone parent cuts Brown pushed through. Some say it was their angry loyalty that gained cast-iron assurances that poor women and children would get the money back many-fold as recompense. They list how they exerted power behind the scenes, lobbying, arguing, writing reports, bending ministers' ears. The higher proportion of women ministers made a difference. (Women hold a third of ministerial posts.) The chancellor never meant to include lone parents in the new deal and it took long argument from Harriet Harman to persuade him child care was critical to poor mothers. Campaigning behind the scenes for maternity and parental rights was all done by women. Dr Childs's report suggests that in constituencies, both women and men with problems find a woman MP more approachable. Their presence has significantly shifted agendas of the select committees. The women claim they often work harder to get policy right in the first place: rebels often scarcely notice an offending policy until it reaches the Commons. So did performers of the Bob Marshall Andrews or Dennis Skin ner variety of MP get more done? They may add to the gaiety of the nation, but where is the beef?</p> <p>Women MPs are, of course, not a homogeneous group. These 101 women, only a half of whom call themselves feminists, include regular rebels such as Anne Cryer, and two cabinet ministers who have done everything to prevent changing the archaic and outrageous House of Commons hours and customs - Margaret Beckett and Ann Taylor. Betty Boothroyd was no sister, nor are many of the others who spit at being lumped together. And yet overall, there remains a generality of women who have a mission to press women's issues in a male legislature.</p> <p>Downing Street (mostly men) has not fully understood the message of the women's political success. Nearly 2m more women than men will vote at the election and yet they are the ones who are most disaffected with Labour. Fawcett Society/Mori research shows women like women MPs better, and remember them more. In elections parties remember this, then they forget again. If Labour has made too little impact with its remarkable tranche of women's policies, that is because they have been presented mainly by the men in the top jobs. It is shocking that only three out 30 Labour held seats have selected women candidates this time - as if the Blair Babes jibe had a lethal effect on local parties. Will the remaining seats all go to women or ethnic candidates in any last-minute selections? Dr Childs's research reveals women MPs who are not obedient, but effective - unless you think noise and notoriety is what counts most.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",

She thinks they did. Only look at the budget to find their handiwork. Maternity pay, child care, part-time workers' rights, lone parents' new deal and a score of other recent measures did far more for women than for men. Ask women MPs and most will say: \"We did that.\" Do you imagine, they ask, that Gordon Brown had babies on his mind when he came to power? Poverty, yes, in the abstract, but without understanding that means women. Where are the manifesto commitments to most of the things that he has spent his money on? It was ex- single mother paymaster general Dawn Primarolo - in a key but silent, back-room post - who required the Treasury to calculate the gender effect of all its actions. (The last budget delivered an average \u00a3440 for women and \u00a3225 for men compared to 1997.) Women were not a central pitch back in 1997, but an afterthought and a disastrous afternoon's photo shoot with the prime minister. Remember how Tony Blair forgot to appoint a women's minister at all, calling Harriet Harman back in a hurry to add it to her brief? Dr Childs notes the changed self-confidence in the MPs since she first interviewed them. Most talk bitterly of their first blooding over the lone parent cuts Brown pushed through. Some say it was their angry loyalty that gained cast-iron assurances that poor women and children would get the money back many-fold as recompense. They list how they exerted power behind the scenes, lobbying, arguing, writing reports, bending ministers' ears. The higher proportion of women ministers made a difference. (Women hold a third of ministerial posts.) The chancellor never meant to include lone parents in the new deal and it took long argument from Harriet Harman to persuade him child care was critical to poor mothers. Campaigning behind the scenes for maternity and parental rights was all done by women. Dr Childs's report suggests that in constituencies, both women and men with problems find a woman MP more approachable. Their presence has significantly shifted agendas of the select committees. The women claim they often work harder to get policy right in the first place: rebels often scarcely notice an offending policy until it reaches the Commons. So did performers of the Bob Marshall Andrews or Dennis Skin ner variety of MP get more done? They may add to the gaiety of the nation, but where is the beef? Women MPs are, of course, not a homogeneous group. These 101 women, only a half of whom call themselves feminists, include regular rebels such as Anne Cryer, and two cabinet ministers who have done everything to prevent changing the archaic and outrageous House of Commons hours and customs - Margaret Beckett and Ann Taylor. Betty Boothroyd was no sister, nor are many of the others who spit at being lumped together. And yet overall, there remains a generality of women who have a mission to press women's issues in a male legislature. Downing Street (mostly men) has not fully understood the message of the women's political success. Nearly 2m more women than men will vote at the election and yet they are the ones who are most disaffected with Labour. Fawcett Society/Mori research shows women like women MPs better, and remember them more. In elections parties remember this, then they forget again. If Labour has made too little impact with its remarkable tranche of women's policies, that is because they have been presented mainly by the men in the top jobs. It is shocking that only three out 30 Labour held seats have selected women candidates this time - as if the Blair Babes jibe had a lethal effect on local parties. Will the remaining seats all go to women or ethnic candidates in any last-minute selections? Dr Childs's research reveals women MPs who are not obedient, but effective - unless you think noise and notoriety is what counts most. polly.toynbee@theguardian.com",

      "body": "<p>On Thursday morning I woke up in a bed that wasn't in Coogee for the first time in a couple of months. It's definitely a good feeling to be away for a bit - I'm really starting to get excited about recommencing my travels in a few weeks time. </p> <p>My mum and I headed into the city early(ish) to explore Queen Victoria markets - another of the many Australian places named after English people/places. The markets were huge with a fantastic selection of fresh fish, meat, cheeses, fruit... and several&nbsp;items I'd never seen or heard of before. It felt like a locals' market, which also made a pleasant change. Purchasing an alternative picnic of sushi roll, sundried tomatoes, bread and fruit we headed back to the Royal Botanic gardens for a late lunch. It may seem unadventurous to head to the same place twice, but when you're sitting shaded by a tree, next to a lake surrounded by black swans and tranquility, it's hard to think of a nicer place to be on a sunny afternoon. Incidentally, it hasn't rained in Melbourne for three months, so we took full advantage of the sun while&nbsp;residents prayed for rain.</p> <p> In the evening we wandered further down the Yarra river, where the shops become more up-market and water-features spring up along the pedestrianised river bank. It was a lovely area and instantly became my 'Darling Harbour' of Melbourne. &nbsp; The highlight of my Melbourne trip was definitely Friday night and our trip to Phillip Island. I've had loads of advice telling me to visit the Penguin Parade on the island, so I was pretty pleased to have the opportunity. Two things I wasn't told beforehand: it takes over two hours to get there (this is a very big country) and you aren't allowed to take photos. Still, neither of these things spoiled our enjoyment of the experience - one that I would certainly recommend to others. </p> <p>We arrived on the island just as the sun was setting and made our way across wooden boardwalks that ran down to the beach. It was here under cover of darkness that the little penguins gathered in groups before waddling up the beach towards us as fast as their little legs would take them to reach the safety of their beach nests.&nbsp; The penguins were enchanting - a mass of tiny black and white figures suddenly appearing at the shoreline as we gathered for this insight into their world. All around us in the bushes they stood calling, with the odd fluffy baby waiting for its parents return from the sea. Absolutely magical. &nbsp; </p> <p>Sadly, the next day we had to leave Melbourne, a city that in a short time I'd come to love. I had a brief stop at my barely seen apartment to relax before work&nbsp; - because good things do come to an end. At least my evening at work involved some entertainment. The party had various live acts including dancers, singers and a girl named Christina Anu with a powerful voice who's been popping up a bit in the papers round here. The evening went on far too late considering I had to be in for breakfast as well. I took a workmate's advice and experimented with having exactly 40 minutes sleep - apparently, this was proven by NASA to be good for you. I wouldn't like to disagree with them, but I wasn't even slightly refreshed. That's one experiment not to try again... At least my morning shift was short (mostly due to my inability to do anything) and then I had a free Sunday afternoon! &nbsp; </p> <p>That evening I was heading out for a last supper with my mum. Before that, however, I met up with the three friends with whom I was originally going to travel, Sapphire, Dave and Gary. They're staying in Coogee for a week before going their separate ways. Gary is heading for Melbourne, Sapphire and Dave are hoping to live and work in Manly.&nbsp;It's not the first time I've seen people split up from their original travelling group - I guess you really get to know people when you're with them 24/7, and sometimes it works out, but other times you want slightly different things. What the three of them (or me for that matter) will do next is a case of wait and see, which is another great thing about travelling - you don't need set plans, you can take each day or week as it comes. &nbsp; </p> <p>Back to my last supper. We headed for Rice, the Asian resteraunt I had been to with Josh a couple of months earlier.&nbsp;It had been great before and didn't disappoint me this time - yet again I ate til I could hardly move - with food that good its hard not to be a bit excessive. My love of Sundays was once more confirmed.</p> <p>On Monday morning I actually had a lie-in, which is one of my most treasured words. I'm grateful I work because it makes me really love those lazy mornings when you slowly get up, think about having breakfast or what you might do with the rest of your day and just enjoy everything. An added bonus was how ridiculously easy my day at work was, leaving me free to stop round at the Dive Hotel for the last time before my mum returns to England. I ended up staying there again - with a hotel so&nbsp;lovely, I'm not exactly drawn up the hill to my own apartment. &nbsp; </p> <p>On Tuesday the sun was out in honour of my mum's departure from Oz. I met her after work for a cake and a cappucino before the inevitable trip to the airport.&nbsp;There's something I hate about seeing other people off at the airport. It's fine when it's me coming or going, or them arriving, but there's just something about the way they disappear through the departure gates that always depresses me.&nbsp;I got it over with as quickly as possible - and if you're reading this, mum,&nbsp;thanks for a lovely two weeks&nbsp;&nbsp;- then tried to cheer myself up by sitting in the sun. It certainly got me thinking about the time I have left and what I want from the rest of my travels. Have I become too settled? How will I take to being a single traveller again? &nbsp;</p> <p> The next day involved a ridiculously quick work shift leaving me an entire day to myself. I met Sapphire and Dave on Coogee beach where we planned our night out - it was the last chance we would have to go out together. Later&nbsp; that evening the three of them came to my place (where Brian is adjusting to the shock of actually having a room-mate again!) to conusme the beer I'd won weeks ago but still hadn't got round to touching. We headed into Sydney to Star City casino as I wanted to show them it out of interest more than any big desire to gamble the night away. Unfortunately we found it strangely addictive (again). I think I was the only one who came away with any winnings, as the enticing machines ate all our money. That place really does have a scary pull. </p> <p>After this we headed to Pyrmont Bridge Hotel (really a pub), one of the many 24-hour drinking establishments round Sydney, where we stayed for the rest of the evening while I became less sober and Gary put lots of tunes on using the jukebox. Before I knew it, it was very late (or early) and I was stumbling back to Coogee for one of the many short night's sleep I've had in recent weeks. Somehow I have to pull myself together for work in a few hours time. I've managed it before but I'm not convinced this time will be so easy... &nbsp; </p> <p>Until next week (when I'll find myself alone in Coogee), &nbsp; Milly &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>",

Mr Hall will report to the party on the inquiry findings but will face a challenge by Mr Kamal to resign.</p> <p>Mr Hall said: \"I will say that there were mitigating circumstances in relation to that charge, which the committee were aware of.\" He said these included the fact that he was not aware that Mr Kamal was making the allegations in relation to a parliamentary inquiry.</p> <p>The Filkin report has underlined the huge divide between the pro and anti-Vaz factions in the local party.</p> <p>Mr Hall attacked as \"baseless\" the latest revelations in the Guardian, relating to an internal Labour inquiry over allegations that Mr Vaz had tried to interfere in city council business.</p> <p>\"Keith has worked closely with the party since he's been in Leicester. That's 16 years,\" he said. \"It is not unique; other MPs have had close relationships with their constituencies.</p> <p>\"In 1985 Leicester was held by the Conservatives. At every election since 1985 the party's performance has been above the national average.</p> <p>\"I've worked with Keith during those 16 years and know there has been a lot of community pressure throughout the constituency - I don't just mean in the Asian community - to take up issues concerning things the council has done.</p> <p>\"There are things it has been necessary for him to do to build a local profile, to continue to do to maintain that local profile. He is a well respected figure in the city.\"</p> <p>A party insider and longstanding critic of Mr Vaz claimed that his support within the local party was eroding. The MP's interest in council affairs had acted as a \"dead hand\" which had promoted parochial projects over the interests of the city as a whole, he claimed.</p> <p>Mr Vaz is thought to be attending the tonight's meeting.</p> <p>Mr Kamal claimed that the local party had gone into decline and attacked the current membership as the MP's \"hangers on\".</p> <p>\"I intend to go and ask Colin Hall, now that he has been found to have committed contempt, if he will take the honourable course and resign.\" The letter Mr Hall had sent him had \"made shivers go down my spine\".</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm200001/cmselect/cmstnprv/314/31402.htm\" target=\"_new\">Standards and privileges committee report</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/parliament/guide/stand.htm\" target=\"_new\">Parliament information on standards</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.public-standards.gov.uk\" target=\"_new\">Committee on standards in public life</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/commons/selcom/s&amp;phome.htm\" target=\"_new\">Standards and privileges committee</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm199697/cmselect/cmstand/688/codefc.htm\" target=\"_new\">MPs' code of conduct, 1996</a><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "A Labour party meeting in Keith Vaz's Leicester East constituency tonight could see a showdown between members over their embattled MP. Normally attended only by a handful of party activists, a packed meeting is expected to hear a demand for the resignation of the constituency chairman, Colin Hall, a Vaz loyalist who was criticised in the Filkin report. Mr Hall was accused of committing \"a serious contempt\" of the Commons standards and privileges committee inquiry by threatening to put legal and disciplinary pressure on a witness, the Leicester city councillor Mustapha Kamal. Mr Hall will report to the party on the inquiry findings but will face a challenge by Mr Kamal to resign. Mr Hall said: \"I will say that there were mitigating circumstances in relation to that charge, which the committee were aware of.\" He said these included the fact that he was not aware that Mr Kamal was making the allegations in relation to a parliamentary inquiry. The Filkin report has underlined the huge divide between the pro and anti-Vaz factions in the local party. Mr Hall attacked as \"baseless\" the latest revelations in the Guardian, relating to an internal Labour inquiry over allegations that Mr Vaz had tried to interfere in city council business. \"Keith has worked closely with the party since he's been in Leicester. That's 16 years,\" he said. \"It is not unique; other MPs have had close relationships with their constituencies. \"In 1985 Leicester was held by the Conservatives. At every election since 1985 the party's performance has been above the national average. \"I've worked with Keith during those 16 years and know there has been a lot of community pressure throughout the constituency - I don't just mean in the Asian community - to take up issues concerning things the council has done. \"There are things it has been necessary for him to do to build a local profile, to continue to do to maintain that local profile. He is a well respected figure in the city.\" A party insider and longstanding critic of Mr Vaz claimed that his support within the local party was eroding. The MP's interest in council affairs had acted as a \"dead hand\" which had promoted parochial projects over the interests of the city as a whole, he claimed. Mr Vaz is thought to be attending the tonight's meeting. Mr Kamal claimed that the local party had gone into decline and attacked the current membership as the MP's \"hangers on\". \"I intend to go and ask Colin Hall, now that he has been found to have committed contempt, if he will take the honourable course and resign.\" The letter Mr Hall had sent him had \"made shivers go down my spine\".

Mr Kapasi's solicitor, Mark Stephens, accused Mrs Filkin of a \"conflict of interest\" because she once served on the audit commission with Sir Peter Soulsby, but thsi objections was described as \"absurd\" by the committee. The committee's verdict: Could not uphold complaint because it was unsafe to rely on what Mr Kapasi said to journalists and there was no hard evidence that payments were received by Mr Vaz. \u0095 Mr Vaz allegedly received cheques as Labour party donations - including one for \u00a31,000 - from Leicester businessman Bakshish Attwal. Mr Vaz's response: Denied he had received the \u00a31,000 cheque. Said Mr Attwal had \"a lapse of memory\" because he was elderly.

Mr Vaz said he no longer hadbank statements for January 1993 and nor could his bank provide copies. The constituency Labour party refused Mrs Filkin permission to look at its bank statements and then said it had lost its records. The committee's verdict: Complaint not upheld because of lack of evidence. \u0095 Mr Vaz was alleged to have received \u00a38 a month for four years from Mustapha Kamal and other Leicester councillors. Mr Vaz's response: Denied it. The evidence: Payments were made by standing order to Leicester East Labour party. The committee's verdict: Complaint not upheld because the money was too small to be worth pursuing. \u0095 The 50 Club, a constituency fundraising club said to be run by Mr Vaz, had allegedly secret accounts. Mr Vaz's response: Denied it. The evidence: Club appeared to be run by the constituency party rather than Mr Vaz. The committee's verdict : Complaint not upheld because it was satisfied that party ran the club and the sums involved were too small to warrant further inquiries. \u0095 Mr Vaz failed to dislcose a Leicester property in the register of MPs' interests. Mr Vaz's response: At first he accused the commissioner of getting the wrong address. Then he admitted it and agreed to register it. The evidence: The property was found to be Mr Vaz's constituency office.

      "body": "<p>A Commons committee yesterday angered the oil industry by calling for a \"name and shame\" exercise against companies which failed to cut petrol prices in line with falls in crude oil costs. </p> <p>The trade and industry select committee said: \"We recommend that the government . . . identify publicly any companies which fail to fulfil the undertaking given to ministers that cuts in duty will be speedily passed on to customers. </p> <p>But BP said that the committee had failed to take into account the nature of the oil industry. </p> <p>A spokesman said that the oil company was dismayed at some of the wording in the select committee's report. </p> <p>He said that crude oil had to undergo a whole series of processes before it reached the pumps, and therefore price reductions always took a period of time to filter through to the customer. </p> <p>MPs also blamed the government for higher oil prices.

      "bodyText": "A Commons committee yesterday angered the oil industry by calling for a \"name and shame\" exercise against companies which failed to cut petrol prices in line with falls in crude oil costs. The trade and industry select committee said: \"We recommend that the government . . . identify publicly any companies which fail to fulfil the undertaking given to ministers that cuts in duty will be speedily passed on to customers. But BP said that the committee had failed to take into account the nature of the oil industry. A spokesman said that the oil company was dismayed at some of the wording in the select committee's report. He said that crude oil had to undergo a whole series of processes before it reached the pumps, and therefore price reductions always took a period of time to filter through to the customer. MPs also blamed the government for higher oil prices. The committee agreed that there were short-term fluctuations that resulted from changes in world crude prices. \"But over the last decade the steady increase in the real price of motor fuel at the pumps has been entirely and intentionally the result of government taxation policies.\" It has produced a table showing that in 1992 the price of a litre of premium unleaded petrol was 43.43p with 14.55p being the pre-tax price, tax being 66% of the total.

      "body": "<p>Poor Nick Brown. The agriculture minister must be dropping on his hooves. He has always resembled a sheep, ambling up to the fence to peer myopically at visitors, but now he looks as if his legs are about to buckle under him. Even Tim Yeo, the Tory spokesman, had a kind word yesterday. \"May I offer my sympathy for the substantial burden he is carrying?\" he asked. No Tory ever said that to Peter Mandelson.</p> <p>The great panic continues and gets more hysterical by the day. Foot and mouth disease is a non-fatal illness which can't harm humans and used to be cured by slapping tarry rags on to beasts which caught it. So it's now been decided that hundreds of thousands of animals must die and large parts of Britain closed down.</p> <p>It's as if you got a call from your child's teacher explaining that he had cold sores, so that all the children would need to be locked permanently into the school. He himself would have to be put down in case any of his classmates caught the infection. You might consider this an overreaction.</p> <p>Anyhow, this is the route the government has gone down, and like Mr Yeo, one can only sympathise with the poor sod who has to put it into action, with no certainty that it will ever work. I felt a particular stab of pity when David Tredinnick, a Tory MP, asked if he had thought of homeopathy. I am a homeophobe myself (not a homophobe - it's only dodgy, magical medical theories I dislike, and please don't write), so I am deeply biased, but frankly I suspect it would have been just as much use if Mr Brown had invited Uri Geller to rub cows' ankles.</p> <p>The minister replied, rather calmly I thought, by saying that it was his job to keep an open mind, and he would draw the chief vet's attention to this idea. He then rolled his eyes to heaven and clutched his stomach. (Of course he didn't, but you could tell he wanted to.)</p> <p>Something has happened to Mr Brown. No doubt a civil servant, reading the papers on a train from Croydon, noticed that he was being criticised for a rather bloodless attitude to the whole crisis, as if it were a mere management problem, and not one which was destroying livelihoods and driving people to suicide.</p> <p>\"This is a devastating disease for farming and rural communities affected,\" he said in a robotic, it-says-on- this-Hallmark-greetings-card kind of way. \"I want to express my deepest sympathy,\" he went on - well, at least for the first time in three weeks he'd actually said it.</p> <p>In the end Mr Yeo was rather less sympathetic than he wanted us to think. After offering \"general support\" to the minister, he launched into a series of criticisms. Last weekend, Mr Brown had claimed that the outbreak was \"absolutely under control\"; since then the number of cases had doubled and they were now arriving at a much faster rate.</p> <p>Mr Brown tried to reply, but instead produced before our wondering eyes a superlative piece of political obfuscation. \"I don't want to get into a semantic argument with you, but when I said that it is absolutely under control, I meant that the movement controls we have in place are very severe indeed, and the fact that more disease emerges doesn't mean that it isn't under control.\"</p> <p>Try picking the bones out of that.</p> <p>Then he told us that the countryside wasn't closed down.

      "bodyText": "Poor Nick Brown. The agriculture minister must be dropping on his hooves. He has always resembled a sheep, ambling up to the fence to peer myopically at visitors, but now he looks as if his legs are about to buckle under him. Even Tim Yeo, the Tory spokesman, had a kind word yesterday. \"May I offer my sympathy for the substantial burden he is carrying?\" he asked. No Tory ever said that to Peter Mandelson. The great panic continues and gets more hysterical by the day. Foot and mouth disease is a non-fatal illness which can't harm humans and used to be cured by slapping tarry rags on to beasts which caught it. So it's now been decided that hundreds of thousands of animals must die and large parts of Britain closed down. It's as if you got a call from your child's teacher explaining that he had cold sores, so that all the children would need to be locked permanently into the school. He himself would have to be put down in case any of his classmates caught the infection. You might consider this an overreaction. Anyhow, this is the route the government has gone down, and like Mr Yeo, one can only sympathise with the poor sod who has to put it into action, with no certainty that it will ever work. I felt a particular stab of pity when David Tredinnick, a Tory MP, asked if he had thought of homeopathy. I am a homeophobe myself (not a homophobe - it's only dodgy, magical medical theories I dislike, and please don't write), so I am deeply biased, but frankly I suspect it would have been just as much use if Mr Brown had invited Uri Geller to rub cows' ankles. The minister replied, rather calmly I thought, by saying that it was his job to keep an open mind, and he would draw the chief vet's attention to this idea. He then rolled his eyes to heaven and clutched his stomach. (Of course he didn't, but you could tell he wanted to.) Something has happened to Mr Brown. No doubt a civil servant, reading the papers on a train from Croydon, noticed that he was being criticised for a rather bloodless attitude to the whole crisis, as if it were a mere management problem, and not one which was destroying livelihoods and driving people to suicide. \"This is a devastating disease for farming and rural communities affected,\" he said in a robotic, it-says-on- this-Hallmark-greetings-card kind of way. \"I want to express my deepest sympathy,\" he went on - well, at least for the first time in three weeks he'd actually said it. In the end Mr Yeo was rather less sympathetic than he wanted us to think. After offering \"general support\" to the minister, he launched into a series of criticisms. Last weekend, Mr Brown had claimed that the outbreak was \"absolutely under control\"; since then the number of cases had doubled and they were now arriving at a much faster rate. Mr Brown tried to reply, but instead produced before our wondering eyes a superlative piece of political obfuscation. \"I don't want to get into a semantic argument with you, but when I said that it is absolutely under control, I meant that the movement controls we have in place are very severe indeed, and the fact that more disease emerges doesn't mean that it isn't under control.\" Try picking the bones out of that. Then he told us that the countryside wasn't closed down. We were welcome to visit market towns, or even \"village events\". It's just that we mustn't go near any \"farmed livestock\". So our patriotic duty is to go for country walks and spend money in pubs, but as soon as we see a gambolling spring lamb, run like hell. What's going on?

      "body": "<p>The reputation of the foreign office minister, Keith Vaz, is expected to suffer a new blow today with the detailed publication of 20 letters between him, his solicitors and Elizabeth Filkin, the parliamentary standards watchdog, showing how the embattled minister prevaricated and refused to answer questions about his affairs.</p> <p>At the same time, he accused those giving evidence to her inquiry of malice, memory loss and introducing irrelevancies.</p> <p>The saga of the letters ends with his solicitor, Geoffrey Bindman, saying Mr Vaz would refuse to answer any more questions from her and would only talk to the committee. The letters will form part of a huge tranche of documents and include detailed evidence from all the main participants in the eight-month inquiry.</p> <p>Mrs Filkin complained that Mr Vaz's refusal to answer questions had prevented her from reaching conclusions on eight of the 18 allegations against him, and the committee was critical of his failure to cooperate with her. Mr Vaz was cleared of nine allegations of accepting thousands of pounds to his office and charities. He was found to have breached one rule - not declaring that he had received two small donations from a City solicitor he recommneded for an honour.</p> <p>The committee decided not to uphold another eight allegations - mainly due to the fact that they could not get hard evidence because Mr Vaz would not hand over documents and because other documents, such as bank state ments, had been lost or destroyed.</p> <p>Some documents will not be published. They include two damning letters from Labour MP Claire Ward to national party officers accusing the minister of \"disgraceful, initimidatory and contemptous behaviour \" during a previous internal Labour inquiry, which were leaked to the Guardian yesterday. But it will contain details of three meetings between the Watford MP and Mrs Filkin about her concerns over Mr Vaz.</p> <p>Yesterday Mr Vaz spoke for the first time about the inquiry's findings. He told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire: \"I was cleared by the privileges committee, I was cleared by Mrs Filkin and no action is to be taken. The simple reason is that those who put forward maliciously false complaints have had their evidence turned over by Mrs Filkin.\"</p> <p>He had decided to stop answering the commissioner's questions last December because he wished to bring the inquiry to an end, in order to quash allegations that he did not want it completed, he said.</p> <p>\"It reached a stage where it had to go to the committee so that those making allegations had to give evidence in front of the committee.</p> <p>\"What was vital was that we had a conclusion and the conclusion was put before the committee and they rejected all the allegations - all but a very minor allegation, and they accepted that nothing had been wrong in terms of the way in which matters were conducted on that.\"</p> <p>Asked if one such charge upheld would be \"mortally damaging\" for a cabinet minister, he said: \"Well, it would, but I'm not in the cabinet\".</p> <p>Mr Vaz's explanation however did not satisfy members of the standards and privileges committee or Lord Neill's committee on standards in public life.</p> <p>Tory committee member Peter Bottomley said Mr Vaz's claim that he had been cleared was \"hopeful\" and that his summary of the report's findings was \"pretty selective\". \"I think the report basically speaks for itself,\" he said. \"He and his solicitor flatly refused to go on cooperating with [Mrs Filkin]. That was wrong.\"</p> <p>A Liberal Democrat member of the committee on standards in public life added his voice to calls for Mr Vaz to go.</p> <p>Lord Goodhart said: \"I think there is a duty on all MPs, and that includes very much ministers as well, to co-operate with any inquiry. Frankly, Mr Vaz was entirely wrong in failing to do so and should go or be removed.</p> <p>\"If a minister refuses to co-operate with the standards commissioner, it seems to me very difficult to see how the prime minister can continue to have confidence in that minister.\"</p> <p>Francis Maude, the shadow foreign secretary, said: \"Mr Vaz has at last admitted that the complaint upheld against him is a resigning offence. He should now get on with it and resign. The foreign minister's conduct is unbecoming. His interviews have been a catalogue of evasions and half-truths.\"</p> <p>The view from Downing Street was very different. \"Mr Vaz has the prime minister's full support. End of story,\" said a spokesman.<br></p> <p><br> <a href=\"http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm200001/cmselect/cmstnprv/314/31402.htm\" target=\"_new\">Standards and privileges committee report</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/parliament/guide/stand.htm\" target=\"_new\">Parliament information on standards</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.public-standards.gov.uk\" target=\"_new\">Committee on standards in public life</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/commons/selcom/s&amp;phome.htm\" target=\"_new\">Standards and privileges committee</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm199697/cmselect/cmstand/688/codefc.htm\" target=\"_new\">MPs' code of conduct, 1996</a><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "The reputation of the foreign office minister, Keith Vaz, is expected to suffer a new blow today with the detailed publication of 20 letters between him, his solicitors and Elizabeth Filkin, the parliamentary standards watchdog, showing how the embattled minister prevaricated and refused to answer questions about his affairs. At the same time, he accused those giving evidence to her inquiry of malice, memory loss and introducing irrelevancies. The saga of the letters ends with his solicitor, Geoffrey Bindman, saying Mr Vaz would refuse to answer any more questions from her and would only talk to the committee. The letters will form part of a huge tranche of documents and include detailed evidence from all the main participants in the eight-month inquiry. Mrs Filkin complained that Mr Vaz's refusal to answer questions had prevented her from reaching conclusions on eight of the 18 allegations against him, and the committee was critical of his failure to cooperate with her. Mr Vaz was cleared of nine allegations of accepting thousands of pounds to his office and charities. He was found to have breached one rule - not declaring that he had received two small donations from a City solicitor he recommneded for an honour. The committee decided not to uphold another eight allegations - mainly due to the fact that they could not get hard evidence because Mr Vaz would not hand over documents and because other documents, such as bank state ments, had been lost or destroyed. Some documents will not be published. They include two damning letters from Labour MP Claire Ward to national party officers accusing the minister of \"disgraceful, initimidatory and contemptous behaviour \" during a previous internal Labour inquiry, which were leaked to the Guardian yesterday. But it will contain details of three meetings between the Watford MP and Mrs Filkin about her concerns over Mr Vaz. Yesterday Mr Vaz spoke for the first time about the inquiry's findings. He told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire: \"I was cleared by the privileges committee, I was cleared by Mrs Filkin and no action is to be taken. The simple reason is that those who put forward maliciously false complaints have had their evidence turned over by Mrs Filkin.\" He had decided to stop answering the commissioner's questions last December because he wished to bring the inquiry to an end, in order to quash allegations that he did not want it completed, he said. \"It reached a stage where it had to go to the committee so that those making allegations had to give evidence in front of the committee. \"What was vital was that we had a conclusion and the conclusion was put before the committee and they rejected all the allegations - all but a very minor allegation, and they accepted that nothing had been wrong in terms of the way in which matters were conducted on that.\" Asked if one such charge upheld would be \"mortally damaging\" for a cabinet minister, he said: \"Well, it would, but I'm not in the cabinet\". Mr Vaz's explanation however did not satisfy members of the standards and privileges committee or Lord Neill's committee on standards in public life. Tory committee member Peter Bottomley said Mr Vaz's claim that he had been cleared was \"hopeful\" and that his summary of the report's findings was \"pretty selective\". \"I think the report basically speaks for itself,\" he said. \"He and his solicitor flatly refused to go on cooperating with [Mrs Filkin]. That was wrong.\" A Liberal Democrat member of the committee on standards in public life added his voice to calls for Mr Vaz to go. Lord Goodhart said: \"I think there is a duty on all MPs, and that includes very much ministers as well, to co-operate with any inquiry. Frankly, Mr Vaz was entirely wrong in failing to do so and should go or be removed. \"If a minister refuses to co-operate with the standards commissioner, it seems to me very difficult to see how the prime minister can continue to have confidence in that minister.\" Francis Maude, the shadow foreign secretary, said: \"Mr Vaz has at last admitted that the complaint upheld against him is a resigning offence. He should now get on with it and resign. The foreign minister's conduct is unbecoming. His interviews have been a catalogue of evasions and half-truths.\" The view from Downing Street was very different. \"Mr Vaz has the prime minister's full support. End of story,\" said a spokesman.

Khalid Mahmood, a 39-year-old Kashmiri Muslim, was this week picked to succeed Jeff Rooker, social security minister and local MP for 27 years, despite two attempts to stall the proceedings - including a failed application for an injunction in the high hourt in London. The Birmingham party has been the scene of faction fighting and legal actions for many years, aggravated by tensions witin rival ethnic minorities in the city. Complaints against Mr Mahmood include his sudden disappearance from Birmingham for over a year shortly after first being elected a city coun cillor, and the collapse of the council-backed British Kashmiri Association with huge debts in 1994. Mr Rooker believes he should not be an MP. Twenty-four hours after Mr Mahmood won the vacant nomination on Sunday - by a decisive 196 votes to 82 for Sukhvinder Stubbs, the runner-up - Labour's ruling national executive committee endorsed his candidacy and the assurance of its regional officials that no impropriety had occurred. Ms Stubbs, a high flying Sikh who was the first pupil from the local Broadway comprehensive to go to university - she won an Oxford First - was chief executive of the Runnymede Trust and sits on the of regional development agency, Advantage West Midlands. Her supporters complain that she was the victim of both ethnic and gender prejudice. Rival camps have also signed statements complaining that Mr Mahmmod's team ob tained postal votes for party members in Perry Barr, in some cases without their permission, and cast them for their candidate.

      "body": "<p>Peter Mandelson told no lies, attempted no deception and made no overt effort to influence the outcome of the Hinduja brothers' passport application. But he had to go. And no Prime Minister with an instinct for self-preservation will ever bring him back.</p> <p>Technically his crime was nothing like as serious as David Willetts's attempt to deceive a House of Commons select committee. And Willetts is now back on the Tory front bench and about to draft the Conservative election manifesto. But he was found guilty only once. Mandelson has been in a succession of scrapes, and, innocent or not, the pattern of his conduct had become intolerable. He enjoyed living dangerously, and fell off the high wire far too often.</p> <p>Although Mandelson was acquitted of all charges, the report exposes a Whitehall machine which is complacent, incompetent and (in a very gentlemanly fashion) institutionally corrupt. The indictment is not that Ministers and civil servants treated the Hindujas in an exceptional way, nor that they helped them by breaking the rules. The report reveals that the rules which are regularly applied - when compounded by a demeaning reverence for wealth - are a disgrace.</p> <p>Among the working-class black and Asian British, the Home Office is notorious for the unsympathetic way in which it treats run-of-the-mill nationality applications. Yet in 1998 Ministers and civil servants competed with each other to give Strichand Hinduja a swift and easy passage. Shameful, but neither improper nor illegal.</p> <p>It is possible to relax some of the basic citizenship requirements 'in the special circumstances of any particular case'. So Andrew Walmsley, head of the Nationality Directorate, suggested that Rule D - which requires 450 days' residence in the UK during the five years before application - might be waived. Hinduja had been paying British taxes.</p> <p>There is no doubt why Hinduja was treated with such deference. In his note to Ministers, Walmsley emphasised a special attribute which he regarded as worthy of 'consideration' when the application for citizenship was considered: 'The family business empire has a corporate wealth of $6-$8 billion and their personal wealth was estimated in 1991 at \u00a3500m.'</p> <p>That wide-eyed description of the brothers' fortune solves the whole Hinduja riddle. It explains why William Hague was photographed with him, Tony Blair accepted invitations to his parties and Peter Mandelson acted as his messenger boy. Sadly, New Labour, no less than the Tories, is hypnotised by big bank balances. Wealth is regarded as synonymous with virtue and success. The mafia of power and money binds Ministers to men who should not be allowed within a mile of No 10.</p> <p>And the money buys privilege. The Hammond Report is explicit about that. Most people who know how Whitehall works will believe that the Mandelson phone call, whatever its formal purpose, guaranteed Hinduja special consideration. But the evidence proves that he was getting it already. As head of the Nationality Directorate, Walmsley 'tended to deal with high-profile cases himself'. And, partly because of his rank and partly because of his lighter case load, his applications progressed more quickly than those processed by his staff. Ergo, high visibility guaranteed speedy attention. So much for equality before the law.</p> <p>Walmsley has moved on. We should be grateful for that. He was not sure of the exact number of days Strichand Hinduja had spent in the country immediately before his nationality application, and he did not require him to apply again after his first attempt had failed. References, he said, were useless since they were usually complimentary.</p> <p>Not all of them. Caroline Elmes of the Foreign Office wrote to say that: 'At the very least, the Hinduja brothers can be said to sail close to the wind.' When he reported to Ministers, Walmsley put it differently. 'At the time of his earlier application there were doubts about the brothers' ability to meet the requirements to be of good character... These were, however, resolved concerning Mr Gopichand Hinduja's application and there is no reason to believe that Mr Strichand Hinduja would not now meet the requirement.' Tell that to the Indian government which will not let him out of the country.</p> <p>The problem, as so often, is the whole culture. Money talks. My Birmingham constituents had no more chance of having their citizenship application treated in the Hinduja way than they had of Blair accepting an invitation to one of their parties. And, although, the Prime Minister was right to act decisively in the removal of Mandelson, he must take some responsibility for not changing the Whitehall view that to those who have much, more shall be given. It is hard for him to make the Home Office change its ways with so much rich men's money swilling about Labour.</p> <p>New Labour is right to denounce old-fashioned socialism's antagonism to success. But success is not a virtue. The least we can accept is that, after the election, the Labour will show some discretion in its choice of millionaires.

Sadly, New Labour, no less than the Tories, is hypnotised by big bank balances. Wealth is regarded as synonymous with virtue and success. The mafia of power and money binds Ministers to men who should not be allowed within a mile of No 10. And the money buys privilege. The Hammond Report is explicit about that. Most people who know how Whitehall works will believe that the Mandelson phone call, whatever its formal purpose, guaranteed Hinduja special consideration. But the evidence proves that he was getting it already. As head of the Nationality Directorate, Walmsley 'tended to deal with high-profile cases himself'. And, partly because of his rank and partly because of his lighter case load, his applications progressed more quickly than those processed by his staff. Ergo, high visibility guaranteed speedy attention. So much for equality before the law. Walmsley has moved on. We should be grateful for that. He was not sure of the exact number of days Strichand Hinduja had spent in the country immediately before his nationality application, and he did not require him to apply again after his first attempt had failed. References, he said, were useless since they were usually complimentary. Not all of them. Caroline Elmes of the Foreign Office wrote to say that: 'At the very least, the Hinduja brothers can be said to sail close to the wind.' When he reported to Ministers, Walmsley put it differently. 'At the time of his earlier application there were doubts about the brothers' ability to meet the requirements to be of good character... These were, however, resolved concerning Mr Gopichand Hinduja's application and there is no reason to believe that Mr Strichand Hinduja would not now meet the requirement.' Tell that to the Indian government which will not let him out of the country. The problem, as so often, is the whole culture. Money talks. My Birmingham constituents had no more chance of having their citizenship application treated in the Hinduja way than they had of Blair accepting an invitation to one of their parties. And, although, the Prime Minister was right to act decisively in the removal of Mandelson, he must take some responsibility for not changing the Whitehall view that to those who have much, more shall be given. It is hard for him to make the Home Office change its ways with so much rich men's money swilling about Labour. New Labour is right to denounce old-fashioned socialism's antagonism to success. But success is not a virtue. The least we can accept is that, after the election, the Labour will show some discretion in its choice of millionaires. The Hammond Report proves - almost absentmindedly - the danger of being dazzled by wealth.

      "body": "<p> &nbsp; Here I am in the very heart of this huge land, and I have to admit to feeling absolutely shattered. This week I have spent seven days with NT Adventure Tours: three days down to Alice Springs, three days in the Uluru (Ayres Rock) area, and a day in the Western Macdonald Ranges. I am in amazing-geology overload. This report and the photos, the product of only a week,&nbsp;cannot do justice to the scenery of this remarkable country.</p> <p> &nbsp; It started last Friday from Darwin. 23 18-to-30-something international travellers and I began the 1500km journey to the Alice. Our tour-leader was called Meatloaf, due not only to his appearence but also to his love of heavy-metal music, which accompanied us most of the way. It has rained more than usual over the previous few weeks in north and central Australia so we have been rewarded with much more vegetation than is usual; in fact our first stop, Katherine, had been flooded the previous week. All&nbsp;was calm now, and we took a boat trip down the stunning Katherine Gorge with the inevitable (and welcome) swim at a waterfall and swimming hole. We got our second wash when a storm broke on the boat ride back. Already soaked, we sheltered under the narrow eaves of a hut, priority given to trying to keep our packs and cameras dry. Somebody found a box of black bin liners and it&nbsp;became a test of ingenuity and fashion skills to create raincovers. If&nbsp; I hadn't wanted to keep my camera dry it would have been a great photo - all these black figures with various holes with heads or just noses sticking out. </p> <p>The camp that evening resembled a scarecrows' convention, with dripping clothes and towels on every branch.&nbsp; My boots were full of water - I think the housemaid at Kuching had cleaned them so thoroughly that the proofing went, too. Unfortunately, everything was still wet when it had to be packed up again. I will leave to your imagination how everything smelt by the time we reached laundry facilities at Alice. </p> <p>On Saturday we ate up the miles down the Stuart Highway, a road that goes in an almost straight line right down to Adelaide - empty apart from tour buses and the occasional road-train (three or more trailers attached to lorries). There were stops at the Mataranka Thermal Springs; the Larrimah pub with its interesting railway museum (the railway used to reach there from Darwin, but had long since been abandoned) and at Daly Waters, a 100-year-old pub where travellers leave their cards or photos. </p> <p>We finally reached our camp at a horse farm outside the mining town of&nbsp; Tennant Creek. Here we were introduced to the swag-bag, a large canvas bag with a foam matress in which you put your sleeping bag - zip it up and you are safe from all the elements. This was the first night we were to spend under the star-filled Australian sky.&nbsp; Most people started off outside, safe from everything - apart from the mosquitos. At regular 10-minute intervals, however, there would be a loud series of expletives and another swag-bag would be rolled up and taken into the tent or kitchen area. I suddenly remembered that I had in fact brought a mozzie net, and six of us formed a star with our heads in the middle and draped the net over our heads. Few of us slept; we were all either too hot, bitten to death, or claustrophobic under the net. The&nbsp;expletives and exodus continued until, in the morning, there were only two Geordie girls, a couple of Danes and me left - the things I do for this website! </p> <p>On Sunday, there were more miles and heavy-metal until we reached the Devil's Marbles:&nbsp;sandstone eroded down to form huge boulders scattered in groups. This&nbsp;is an Aboriginal dream place, where the women and children gather to pass on stories, including tales of children disappearing, taken by the spirits.&nbsp; It certainly was impressive and atmospheric. </p> <p>The landscape was changing now, the trees becoming sparser, the speargrass shorter and more red soil and rock appearing.&nbsp; Unforgiving country for anyone who leaves the highway unprepared or without the necessary knowledge of how to travel across it.&nbsp;We stopped at one roadhouse to say hello to the inseparable camel and donkey that our tour-guide knew. They came bounding over at once, and the camel immediately stuck his head right into the bus and into the apple box. We finally reached Alice Springs, just in time to do the laundry, have a quick shower and send the odd email before the free dinner and party at the hostel - a raucous affair that I left early, in favour of&nbsp;my bed&nbsp;and air conditioning. </p> <p>We were up again at 5am to head off for phase two, with one or two new faces (including a new tour-leader), and many of the others still semi-drunk or hungover from the night before. We went first to the Watarrka National Park - the King's Canyon. This is a spectacular gorge where we did an 8km walk high on the cliffs, with a lovely swim half-way round in a rock-pool. How did mother nature know to provide these swimming areas in such strategic places, just when you are exhausted and&nbsp;boiling from walking in 35C temperatures? Bless her! Another night under the stars was planned&nbsp;(no mozzies in this area) but the arrival of a scorpion in the kitchen area sent some scurrying into their tents, and several others opting to spend an uncomfortable night on the bus.&nbsp; I&nbsp;had a blissful&nbsp;sleep outside, cool and refreshing. </p> <p>Next day started with a trip to the impressive Uluru Cultural Centre, to read about the rock and how the indigenous people regained it in 1984. Then we went to Kata Tjuta, the Olgas, a huge landmass like Ayres Rock, but broken up into enormous boulders. I admit&nbsp;that I had never heard of this area, but&nbsp;the landscape, the atmosphere, and the 9km walk there made it my&nbsp; favourite part of the whole tour.&nbsp;The cloud&nbsp;that had made&nbsp;walking&nbsp;pleasant cleared in time for us to join the masses for Uluru at sunset. Coaches, many with elaborate picnics and champagne on ice, abounded. We tried to find as quiet&nbsp;a spot as possible&nbsp; for our champagne (which we drank out of plastic cups) and biscuits as the sun set, casting shadows on the rock. </p> <p>Everyone was back again for a repeat performance at dawn. Most of my group had decided not to climb the rock in deference to the Aboriginal people's wishes; the few who wanted to couldn't anyway, as it was too windy and the climb was closed. We all did the 10km base walk, romping round in about an hour and a half and waking up the tour-leader, who had been hoping to catch up on at least three hours sleep while we were away.&nbsp; It&nbsp;was hard to capture any of the atmosphere of this place as it was so busy - even the walk was awash with people, many ignoring the notices which asked you not to take photographs at sites of great significance to the Aborigines. The tourist can be a crass, destructive creature. I don't know if it was because we were all so tired by now, but many of us found the Rock a bit of an anti-climax, and had preferred either King's Canyon or the Olgas. </p> <p>So it was back to Alice, and goodbye to most of the group. Only Karen from Canada and I took up the free day at the Western Macdonald Ranges.&nbsp; This was a nice, relaxed day spent visiting&nbsp; creeks and gorges, with a pleasant walk that included wading through a thigh-high river. A swim at Ellery Creek Big Hole finished off a good day. </p> <p>So that was the outback and the Red Centre. I have really enjoyed this glimpse of Australia's bush and all the sights, but I am tiring of tours. They are&nbsp; a relatively cheap way of seeing as much as possible in a short time, and great for youngsters. The tour-leaders are knowledgable, and the facilities usually good. But at times I have craved the less social - even lonelier - days of wandering around on my own. This is not a criticism of the youngsters, who are a great crowd and&nbsp; inclusive of all who travel with them,&nbsp; but I wish there was an affordable alternative for those who don't want to&nbsp;hire a car or join&nbsp; either buses or tours full of&nbsp; travellers who are mostly in their early 20s. The only Australians I have met have been the tour-leaders. Maybe in such a huge country I am asking the impossible. </p> <p>I am looking forward to Cairns tomorrow, where I am meeting up with the actual Australians that I met in Baku National Park in Sarawak. I haven't yet decided how to spend my week there, but I reckon that I've got to give snorkelling on the Barrier Reef a go, even though I don't like putting my head underwater. I'll let you know how I get on. </p> <p>I am going to have a lazy day today. I need to retrieve my big pack from the storage room. I wonder why it's still so full when I haven't needed anything from it for the last eight days - obviously some serious thinning out needed. </p> <p>Until next Friday when I hope I will be less tired - goodbye.</p>",

Anyone who cares for Spurs will see this is a bizarre and inexplicable decision. </p> <p>\"'Every club has a limited budget and to say that I have broken some confidence in revealing this 'secret' just demonstrates how little the new owners understand about the game. The saddest element for me is that the club had started putting together a great run of results and I had managed to build a wonderful team spirit. All of this is now at risk'. </p> <p>\"Mr Graham believes that ENIC always intended to sack him when they came in and for them to say that it was him who had 'his own agenda' was untrue and a complete reversal of the facts.\"</p> <p>Graham's Spurs career ended when he was summoned to an emergency meeting with Spurs executive vice-chairman David Buchler and was told the club could no longer work with him. </p> <p>It follows Graham revealing at a press conference yesterday details of his meeting this week with Tottenham's new owners ENIC. </p> <p>In an exclusive interview with PA Sport, Buchler said: \"I had a private meeting with George Graham and David Pleat this week and then found this morning details of it plastered across the press. </p> <p>\"I called George in for an explanation today. However, no explanation was forthcoming - and he had a defiant attitude. </p> <p>\"I am building from top to bottom a cohesive team, and this is a difficult time for the club with a semi-final coming up and negotiations with players over contracts. </p> <p>\"We agreed we cannot work with each other. I am not prepared to have someone who is not a team player and who is not looking after the club's interests.\" </p> <p>Pleat will take charge of the team for tomorrow's home clash against Coventry, with Tottenham's director of football \"happy to step into the breach\" according to Buchler. </p> <p>Buchler has no one in mind for Graham's immediate successor, but it is expected the new man will be in place by April 8 when Spurs face Arsenal in their FA Cup semi-final at Old Trafford. </p> <p>A list of candidates has already surfaced, including Glenn Hoddle, Gianluca Vialli, Joe Kinnear and Terry Venables among others, and Buchler added: \"They are all great names. </p> <p>\"But I did not anticipate it would come to this and I have not spoken to any other manager in relation to the job here. I have nobody else lined up. </p> <p>\"There are lots of names that will go into the hat, and that is something I will be thinking about with the club chairman Daniel Levy during the course of the next week or two.\" </p> <p>Two former Tottenham greats were stunned by Graham's dismissal, insisting he had done the best he could in difficult circumstances. </p> <p>They backed the former Arsenal and Leeds boss to bounce back into football management. </p> <p>Goalscoring ace Clive Allen said: \"I think George feels he's done a good job. The club is in a healthy position at the moment, and he would have probably wanted to push the club on another step next season. </p> <p>\"I'm sure George hasn't enjoyed the experience and I would think he will probably just relax for a while, take stock of what health he's in and where he goes from there. </p> <p>\"But George is a great football manager, and I'd be very surprised if there were not a lot of people who were very interested in having him working for them.\" </p> <p>Chris Waddle, who called the news \"a very, very surprising decision\", said: \"He's a first-class manager, but it is very difficult to work under those circumstances. </p> <p>\"I think they ENIC want to get their own people in and they might not be George's cup of tea - and unfortunately for George it has cost him his job. </p> <p>\"But we haven't seen the last of him. He's a very good coach, and I wouldn't be surprised if he goes abroad and becomes a big success over there.\"</p>",

Anyone who cares for Spurs will see this is a bizarre and inexplicable decision. \"'Every club has a limited budget and to say that I have broken some confidence in revealing this 'secret' just demonstrates how little the new owners understand about the game. The saddest element for me is that the club had started putting together a great run of results and I had managed to build a wonderful team spirit. All of this is now at risk'. \"Mr Graham believes that ENIC always intended to sack him when they came in and for them to say that it was him who had 'his own agenda' was untrue and a complete reversal of the facts.\" Graham's Spurs career ended when he was summoned to an emergency meeting with Spurs executive vice-chairman David Buchler and was told the club could no longer work with him. It follows Graham revealing at a press conference yesterday details of his meeting this week with Tottenham's new owners ENIC. In an exclusive interview with PA Sport, Buchler said: \"I had a private meeting with George Graham and David Pleat this week and then found this morning details of it plastered across the press. \"I called George in for an explanation today. However, no explanation was forthcoming - and he had a defiant attitude. \"I am building from top to bottom a cohesive team, and this is a difficult time for the club with a semi-final coming up and negotiations with players over contracts. \"We agreed we cannot work with each other. I am not prepared to have someone who is not a team player and who is not looking after the club's interests.\" Pleat will take charge of the team for tomorrow's home clash against Coventry, with Tottenham's director of football \"happy to step into the breach\" according to Buchler. Buchler has no one in mind for Graham's immediate successor, but it is expected the new man will be in place by April 8 when Spurs face Arsenal in their FA Cup semi-final at Old Trafford. A list of candidates has already surfaced, including Glenn Hoddle, Gianluca Vialli, Joe Kinnear and Terry Venables among others, and Buchler added: \"They are all great names. \"But I did not anticipate it would come to this and I have not spoken to any other manager in relation to the job here. I have nobody else lined up. \"There are lots of names that will go into the hat, and that is something I will be thinking about with the club chairman Daniel Levy during the course of the next week or two.\" Two former Tottenham greats were stunned by Graham's dismissal, insisting he had done the best he could in difficult circumstances. They backed the former Arsenal and Leeds boss to bounce back into football management. Goalscoring ace Clive Allen said: \"I think George feels he's done a good job. The club is in a healthy position at the moment, and he would have probably wanted to push the club on another step next season. \"I'm sure George hasn't enjoyed the experience and I would think he will probably just relax for a while, take stock of what health he's in and where he goes from there. \"But George is a great football manager, and I'd be very surprised if there were not a lot of people who were very interested in having him working for them.\" Chris Waddle, who called the news \"a very, very surprising decision\", said: \"He's a first-class manager, but it is very difficult to work under those circumstances. \"I think they ENIC want to get their own people in and they might not be George's cup of tea - and unfortunately for George it has cost him his job. \"But we haven't seen the last of him. He's a very good coach, and I wouldn't be surprised if he goes abroad and becomes a big success over there.\"",

More importantly, a clear principle of acceptable behaviour in politics or, indeed, any walk of life is at stake. Nobody should be able to use their spouse to gain advancement or unreasonable advantage. </p> <p>Professor Davis's efforts, on behalf of his Canadian friend, at the very least ran the risk of being seen as trying to do just that.\"</p>",

An editorial in the same newspaper, published Sunday, cocked a snoot at the dramatic increase in the number of yeshiva students registered in Israel - up 20% in the last year and a half. The increase, said the leader, \"raises grave doubts about the accuracy with which attendance figures are reported in modern Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox educational institutions.\" According to the article, the inflation of these figures is happening because higher attendance figures at rabbinical institutions translate into \"excessively large\" allocations of government funding for the schools. Korean exodus Broken systems, alas, also featured as an editorial theme in the Korea Times. \"An outstanding trend of these days, particularly among those in their 30s and 40s, is the mass exodus in search of a better life, society and education for their children to foreign lands,\" began a leader headlined Public Education Crisis. Too many middle-aged wealth-creators, it claimed, \"have been compelled to leave the country, fed up with the nation's educational circumstances and political and economic situation.\" The leader squarely blamed South Korea's much-vaunted public education system, describing it as the \"people's target of criticism and complaint\", on whose account public confidence is falling \"due to the government's inconsistent policies and the deteriorating educational circumstances\". Lobbygate in New Zealand In New Zealand, the newspaper commentary on education was much more specific - concentrating on just one man, Peter Davis, a British-born professor of public health at the country's Christchurch Medical School, who also happens to be Prime Minister Helen Clark's husband. According to documents tabled this week in the New Zealand parliament, Dr Davis had twice used the email address of Ms Clark's private secretary to lobby for his acknowledged friend, the Canadian academic Joel Lexchin, to be flown to New Zealand for a 10-day stint as a consultant involved of an official review of a government health funding agency. The New Zealand Herald said, \"Having been married to a politician for 20 years, Professor Davis should have known much better. More importantly, a clear principle of acceptable behaviour in politics or, indeed, any walk of life is at stake. Nobody should be able to use their spouse to gain advancement or unreasonable advantage. Professor Davis's efforts, on behalf of his Canadian friend, at the very least ran the risk of being seen as trying to do just that.\"",

      "body": "<p>In a white-washed room, there was a naked academic in a pair of ballet shoes, doing a pli\u00e9. She did a high kick and made eye-contact with her third- year undergraduates across the room. Was it to make sure they were taking notes? They were. Dr Cathy MacGregor, feminist and Andrea Dworkin-follower, did a few more sensual moves while saying in a deadpan, sarcastic and totally depressed voice: \"When I do this, it really turns me on. Oh, yes, it really, really makes me come. Oh, yes. Yes, oh.\" </p> <p>Cathy MacGregor is a lecturer at Wolverhampton University. She specialises in drama and has written extensively about the portrayal of women in the work of sexist male dramatists. Last year, she felt she would look further at the women's side of entertainment and went to New York to get a job as a lapdancer. She earned around $500 a night and learned a lot about the business, not least that the quick financial gain could be addictive. </p> <p>She also thought a lot about herself. As well as lecturing in art, she did performance art. As a lecturer, she earned less in a month than she did dancing for 48 hours. The work in New York had already funded her art, while lecturing had left her lacking. This year, she will ditch the lecturing job to go back to Florida to work full-time as a dancer. \"The money will let me fund my feminist, intellectual creative work.\" </p> <p>Last night, Nottingham council made an exception to its city-wide ban on nude performance to let MacGregor perform her one-woman, nude art, Scarlett's story: Part One at Nottingham Trent University. The show features her video diaries, ballet dance and deconstruction of lapdancing moves to spoken views on the industry. \"When the audience comes in, I am naked. I make a point of making eye-contact with all of them. Later, as I am going through the moves of dancing, I speak the mundanity of what is going through my head. I say: 'God, my feet are killing me. I am dying for a cup of tea.'\" </p> <p>The local press in Nottingham has spent the week running headlines on the \"naked academic\". In person, MacGregor is slight and shy. In crumpled, fitted pinstripe suit and nice boots, she walks with the small steps of a ballet dancer. When she talks about sex, she pushes her red fingernail around the rim of a floral mug. She tells me how tempting lapdancing was, and how she is looking forward to leaving academia and returning. </p> <p>Last summer, MacGregor, a Catholic from London who had then been lecturing for four years, rang her friend Ralf in New York. Ralf worked in a New Age emporium and was into the more progressive eastern philosophicial ideas about sex. She said she wanted to do some lapdancing and he went to check out some bars. He found one: carpeted, non-nude, 80s decor, and where the men stood round the bar. Wolverhampton University paid the airfare and MacGregor went out to watch the women work and earn some money herself. </p> <p>\"I worked eight- or nine-hour shifts with no breaks, except to sprint back to the dressing- room to retouch my make-up. I had no lunch. I worked the day shift, so there were fewer girls. If there were only four of us, it was very hard work. We worked three or four songs at a time, then we got down off the bar and interacted with the men to get tips. They would tip us $1 a song. We would chat to them to try and persuade them to pay for a private dance. I stress the hard-work aspect. This is a skilled and demanding industry, and we should respect it.\" </p> <p>There were rules at the New York bar. Women - \"girls\" - had to wear a smart cocktail dress and remove it to show a G-string. They danced to chart songs, most often Madonna, and the black women were allowed to do hip hop songs. </p> <p>MacGregor worked for two months. The friends she made in the business were mostly around her age - late-twenties. Some had come from Argentina or Latin America. One, Gaby, was from Yugoslavia and danced because \"she wanted to move to America and the money helped\". The women's salaries were unregulated. They paid $40 a night to dance, then took home the flat rate of $20 a song, plus tips. \"I saw that the young 22-year-olds were overwhelmed by the earning rate. They found it hard to stop because the money was so attractive. I realised that I could work a three-day week and earn what I earned as a lecturer full-time.\" </p> <p>MacGregor went back to the US at Christmas, this time to Florida, and did another month's work at the Florida Diamond topless bar. The money was funding her art. She met her boyfriend in Florida and will now move back there permanently. She says dancing is compatible with feminism. \"I had always been interested in the idea of stripping, initially as a naughty fantasy, inspired by the desire, but also by the fear of being looked at as a sexual object,\" she says. </p> <p>MacGregor does not tell her dancing friends that she is a feminist academic, in case they think she is intellectually superior. But she says her gender theory is completely compatible with the sex business. \"Lapdancing is a logical step from my intellectual, feminist work. You are empowered. You choose where you work. You leave if you don't like it. You never, ever have to put up with crap from a man. You work for yourself, so no one can tell you you're fired if you don't take crap from a punter. You simply act out a parody of female sexuality, under stage names like Demon and Seduction. Then you take the money home. It is like being a female drag queen.\" </p> <p>MacGregor feels it has made her stronger. \"I am very shy. Before dancing, people used to look at me in the street, and I looked down, feeling uncomfortable. Now, if someone looks, I keep staring until they look away. I feel able to do this.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>It was little more than 20 years ago that a group of men in suits waving a bucket stormed on to the stage of the University of South Africa's lecture hall, pinned down Floors van Jaarsveld, and tarred and feathered him. Van Jaarsveld's crime was to question the myth of Afrikanerdom's holiest day - the Day of Covenant. The prominent historian asked how Afrikaners could claim that divine intervention enabled 471 Boers to defeat 15,000 Zulus at the Battle of Blood River when the whites had been slaughtered at a previous encounter between the two. Did God switch sides, he wondered? </p> <p>It was too much for Eugene Terre'Blanche and his neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance Movement (AWB). Almost no one in South Africa had heard of Terre'Blanche until he led the charge on to the stage to punish Van Jaarsveld's heresy. After that, the AWB's ranks swelled, while the historian was shunned and suddenly dropped from invitations to speak at other universities. White South Africa was far from ready to question the myths about God, race and land that provided the deluded moral and intellectual basis for apartheid. </p> <p>Two decades later, the Day of the Covenant holiday has been consigned to a very tall scrap heap of discarded fictions once taken as factual history. But South Africa is grappling to decide what to replace them with. \"The standard thing here is to unlearn what you've learned in school,\" says Bill Nasson, head of history at the University of Cape Town. \"You have this old history which is that South Africa starts in 1652 with the arrival of Jan van Riebeeck. That's gone. The problem is what you replace that with. You could replace it with the liberation struggle that begins in 1653, but that simply replaces one form of nationalist history with another.\" </p> <p>\"South Africa has a very complex history. It's the only country in Africa that had slaves imported from other parts of Africa, and when some of those slaves were freed they took slaves themselves. The problem is to address this kind of thing without vilifying one group and making martyrs of another. Nothing is straightforward in our history.\" </p> <p>The first stage of officially reassessing South Africa's history has focused on schools, which are still waiting for the government to decide what will be taught, let alone rewrite the text books and print them. The education ministry appointed a committee of prominent historians, anthropologists and archaeologists - including Nasson - to mull over how best to address South Africa's complex past. There was common agreement that history is discredited and therefore in crisis. </p> <p>\"Some schools have even come to regard history as a subject for less able learners or those with a low IQ. It is no great surprise that both at schools and in many universities, students have been deserting the study of history,\" the report said. \"It is a considerable irony that we are having to address a 'crisis in history' when the pressing importance of history continues to be demonstrated daily in South Africa. For we live in a society in which contemporary issues are continually understood and judged within the powerful context of a past which has bequeathed a violent legacy of conquest, colonialism and apartheid.\" </p> <p>The result of the crisis is a school system still heavily reliant on the old history books. Revised textbooks are available for those schools that can afford them. Some, such as the pioneering National Education Crisis Committee Peoples' History book, are widely praised. Others are simply the old version of events with a picture of Nelson Mandela on the cover. But there is no common direction or consistency. </p> <p>The easy bit for the education department was deciding to dump the version of history propagated under what was called \"Christian National Education\", peppered with white heroes with Dutch surnames. For decades, children of all races learned that the Afrikaner was the real victim of South Africa's perpetual strife. As it was told, the peaceful Boers who settled in the Cape were abused and oppressed by the British in the early 19th century, and so forced to make the Great Trek north. They were attacked and betrayed by the great African chiefs, including the king of the Zulus, and so had to fight for their survival. </p> <p>And when they had finally established their own countries with the Boer republics, the British made war to get their hands on Johannesburg's gold mines. Tens of thousands of Boer women and children were murdered in the infamous British concentration camps. And when it was over, the Afrikaner was a British subject and a second-class citizen. </p> <p>Only in 1948, with the election of the National party government, was the Afrikaner liberated. All of this went to justify the imposition of apartheid. It was not a form of oppression, its authors argued, but a survival strategy for a people persecuted on all sides. </p> <p>In this version of history there was no room for the fate of the Khoikhoi, slaughtered after Van Riebeeck's arrival, or the tens of thousands of black people who also died in the British concentration camps. There was no mention of stolen land or forced removals or the execution of African men for wanting the right to govern. Neither was there recognition of the iron-age settlements in what is now Johannesburg, because that conflicted with the version of history that says the Afrikaners did not steal the land because it was empty. </p> <p>Much of Afrikaner historical orthodoxy emanated from Stellenbosch University. The last head of the history department was also chairman of the Broederbond, the secretive collection of Afrikaner men who guided apartheid ideology and government policy. Today, the department is led by Albert Grundlingh, the first person to hold the post who is not a former student at Stellenbosch. \"History in this country is a congealed set of misunderstandings,\" he says. \"The problemtoday is that after 1994 [and South Africa's first all-race election], history sort of vanished. I would like to suggest that history has served its purpose so far as the liberation movement was concerned. They don't need it to justify being in power. That was not the case of the Afrikaners who used history even after they won power in 1948. It was used to justify everything they did. </p> <p>\"I don't think we want to substitute one set of heroes for another - black for white. But we have to begin somewhere and I'd like to think that there is a hidden history of black and white cooperation. You can ask yourself how it is possible to maintain a system like apartheid over 300 years without cooperation. That is a good basis for exploration.\" </p> <p>Thabo Bashe knows only too well the shortcomings of the old version of history. Once a political prisoner, he is now deputy headmaster of Zola secondary school in Khayelitsha, one of the sprawling black townships outside Cape Town. \"There's a lot that we weren't taught in school. It was more about the Great Trek and how black people were stealing the cattle from white people and how the whites developed from the Western Cape to the interior,\" he says. </p> <p>\"We wanted to know more about the struggle against apartheid. At school, nothing would be said about that. As students we wanted to learn about Mandela and how the land was taken from black farmers. I went to a meeting addressed by Steve Biko and that was the first time we heard about our own history. We saw teachers at the time as part of the system. We even stoned the house of our headmaster. I don't know why we did that. It wasn't his fault.\" </p> <p>Yet 11 years after Mandela was released from prison, and seven years after he was elected president, Zola secondary school still relies on apartheid-era history books. Some pupils use a 1987 text, History in Action, written specifically for black schools. It has 30 pages on the Great Trek. There are just three on black South African history. \"The Great Trek was an independence movement, an act of self-preservation, a protest against British racial policies and a manifestation of the pioneering spirit of the Afrikaner,\" the book says. The British \"racial policies\" the trekkers protested against was the abolition of slavery. When the text finally addresses emancipation, it is to paint the Boers as the victims of the end of slavery. </p> <p>\"The Afrikaner farmers were not opposed to the freeing of slaves but they were dissatisfied with the way it was carried out, without a law passed to prevent vagrancy. The freed slaves wandered about and lived by stealing. In this way the farmers' losses were increased,\" it says. </p> <p>Bashe despairs. \"If you go to class, most teachers are still teaching using the same books and asking the same questions of learners and marking them in the same way,\" he says. \"The sad thing is, the learners don't seem to notice. It takes a long time to get the idea of white superiority out of the system, even among black learners. It's easy for me here because when I talk about apartheid you expect everyone to be against it. But there are learners here who say it was better to have a white government than a black government.\" </p> <p>To the disquiet of some teachers, a survey by Johannesburg's Witwatersrand University discovered that a high proportion of black schoolchildren want to know more, not less, about Jan van Riebeeck. But it is not the old Bantu education version they are interested in. What pupils are curious about are the real reasons that whites came at all, and what happened next to the black people who encountered the Dutch settlers. In other words, how did black people find themselves lorded over in their own land? </p> <p>Bashe says that in many ways it would be easier to leave history out of the curriculum. \"History is very difficult. It's very difficult to say these are the facts and these facts are beyond question. If you look at the role of Shaka and his part in building the Zulu nation, he was taking over the smaller ethnic groups and some fled to what is Lesotho now. Zulu students may see him as a hero, but Shaka is not a hero to those he chased out. They regard him as a villain,\" he says. </p> <p>\"But we have to teach history because these learners must be able to understand why we have Khayelitsha and why there are only black people here and why there are no coloured [mixed-race] or white people. They will understand this is a wrong thing and that is why this must never happen again. So if the government says we are going to oppress the white people who did this to us, they need to understand why that is wrong.\" </p> <p>Many whites have already reinterpreted history to suit themselves. So few admit they supported apartheid that it is amazing that the National party remained in power so long. But on the whole they just avoid the subject. \"In Afrikaner circles there has been a flight from history because of apartheid. You don't want to be reminded time and again of crimes committed in your name,\" says Dr Grundlingh. \"But there are others who are discovering another false history. Among some coloured [mixed-race] people there's the deliberate invention of a Khoikhoi heritage as a way of saying we were here before the black people. It's one-upping the Africans. It's a joke because I don't think any of them have Khoikhoi blood. This is how myths are made.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "It was little more than 20 years ago that a group of men in suits waving a bucket stormed on to the stage of the University of South Africa's lecture hall, pinned down Floors van Jaarsveld, and tarred and feathered him. Van Jaarsveld's crime was to question the myth of Afrikanerdom's holiest day - the Day of Covenant. The prominent historian asked how Afrikaners could claim that divine intervention enabled 471 Boers to defeat 15,000 Zulus at the Battle of Blood River when the whites had been slaughtered at a previous encounter between the two. Did God switch sides, he wondered? It was too much for Eugene Terre'Blanche and his neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance Movement (AWB). Almost no one in South Africa had heard of Terre'Blanche until he led the charge on to the stage to punish Van Jaarsveld's heresy. After that, the AWB's ranks swelled, while the historian was shunned and suddenly dropped from invitations to speak at other universities. White South Africa was far from ready to question the myths about God, race and land that provided the deluded moral and intellectual basis for apartheid. Two decades later, the Day of the Covenant holiday has been consigned to a very tall scrap heap of discarded fictions once taken as factual history. But South Africa is grappling to decide what to replace them with. \"The standard thing here is to unlearn what you've learned in school,\" says Bill Nasson, head of history at the University of Cape Town. \"You have this old history which is that South Africa starts in 1652 with the arrival of Jan van Riebeeck. That's gone. The problem is what you replace that with. You could replace it with the liberation struggle that begins in 1653, but that simply replaces one form of nationalist history with another.\" \"South Africa has a very complex history. It's the only country in Africa that had slaves imported from other parts of Africa, and when some of those slaves were freed they took slaves themselves. The problem is to address this kind of thing without vilifying one group and making martyrs of another. Nothing is straightforward in our history.\" The first stage of officially reassessing South Africa's history has focused on schools, which are still waiting for the government to decide what will be taught, let alone rewrite the text books and print them. The education ministry appointed a committee of prominent historians, anthropologists and archaeologists - including Nasson - to mull over how best to address South Africa's complex past. There was common agreement that history is discredited and therefore in crisis. \"Some schools have even come to regard history as a subject for less able learners or those with a low IQ. It is no great surprise that both at schools and in many universities, students have been deserting the study of history,\" the report said. \"It is a considerable irony that we are having to address a 'crisis in history' when the pressing importance of history continues to be demonstrated daily in South Africa. For we live in a society in which contemporary issues are continually understood and judged within the powerful context of a past which has bequeathed a violent legacy of conquest, colonialism and apartheid.\" The result of the crisis is a school system still heavily reliant on the old history books. Revised textbooks are available for those schools that can afford them. Some, such as the pioneering National Education Crisis Committee Peoples' History book, are widely praised. Others are simply the old version of events with a picture of Nelson Mandela on the cover. But there is no common direction or consistency. The easy bit for the education department was deciding to dump the version of history propagated under what was called \"Christian National Education\", peppered with white heroes with Dutch surnames. For decades, children of all races learned that the Afrikaner was the real victim of South Africa's perpetual strife. As it was told, the peaceful Boers who settled in the Cape were abused and oppressed by the British in the early 19th century, and so forced to make the Great Trek north. They were attacked and betrayed by the great African chiefs, including the king of the Zulus, and so had to fight for their survival. And when they had finally established their own countries with the Boer republics, the British made war to get their hands on Johannesburg's gold mines. Tens of thousands of Boer women and children were murdered in the infamous British concentration camps. And when it was over, the Afrikaner was a British subject and a second-class citizen. Only in 1948, with the election of the National party government, was the Afrikaner liberated. All of this went to justify the imposition of apartheid. It was not a form of oppression, its authors argued, but a survival strategy for a people persecuted on all sides. In this version of history there was no room for the fate of the Khoikhoi, slaughtered after Van Riebeeck's arrival, or the tens of thousands of black people who also died in the British concentration camps. There was no mention of stolen land or forced removals or the execution of African men for wanting the right to govern. Neither was there recognition of the iron-age settlements in what is now Johannesburg, because that conflicted with the version of history that says the Afrikaners did not steal the land because it was empty. Much of Afrikaner historical orthodoxy emanated from Stellenbosch University. The last head of the history department was also chairman of the Broederbond, the secretive collection of Afrikaner men who guided apartheid ideology and government policy. Today, the department is led by Albert Grundlingh, the first person to hold the post who is not a former student at Stellenbosch. \"History in this country is a congealed set of misunderstandings,\" he says. \"The problemtoday is that after 1994 [and South Africa's first all-race election], history sort of vanished. I would like to suggest that history has served its purpose so far as the liberation movement was concerned. They don't need it to justify being in power. That was not the case of the Afrikaners who used history even after they won power in 1948. It was used to justify everything they did. \"I don't think we want to substitute one set of heroes for another - black for white.

It's a very small, cameo performance on one level.</p> <p><strong>Charlotte Rampling:</strong> First of all because of Alan Parker, who is a friend, I've known him a long time and I admire him enormously, and then it was Mickey Rourke, and then it was the fascinating screenplay and it became irresistible. Even if it was just one big scene, you're always talking about this women, this woman holds tremendous power through the film. The film is quite astounding really.</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> That's the point, it's her film.</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> Almost, yeah, although she's hardly ever there.</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> When you play that scene, you're competing with an astonishing set, crammed with detail. I wonder how easy it is acting with, but against, the d\u00e9cor.</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> Well, you just don't think about it. You'd very quickly drown otherwise.</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> It must be quite alarming to have that sort of detail around you.</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> I don't actually look very much. I think, in a sense, it's a pity, but that's the only way I can protect myself in this business. I just look to the essential of what I have to look at, and the rest I don't see. People will say, \"Did you see that?\" I will say, \"No. I actually didn't.\" So if you say to me that room was very decorated, I had no idea that it was.</p> <p>It's also like that with the technicians, and all the movement and the agitation and the razzamatazz that goes around on a day's filming, if I connect into what is really happening then I'll lose what I need to be able to do what I have to do. So I blank out a lot of stuff.</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> Was it fun to work with Rourke?</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> Yeah. He was wonderful then too, he was really good, he was well and he was happy and it was a good moment in his life. He became a very good friend, yup.</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> In terms of performing, what made it good to be with him at that moment?</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> Because he is a highly instinctive, sensual actor and at that time he was at the peak of all that. He was quite remarkable. He just vibrated. He's not clever like a De Niro, who he was acting with, but he had great gifts. Has great gifts. He hasn't done much now, but then he was at the peak of his power, of his sensuality, of his animal side, of his instinctive side. Alan is a very powerful director, so he was able to keep him there, chain him in there and not let him go from there. Whereas if he's allowed to go on his own, he then gets out of control.</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> It's an American style of acting that some people call \"spit and sawdust.\" It couldn't be more different than your style. Because it's so overwhelming, Rourke's style, when it works, 200,000 volts in one person, how difficult is it to maintain your presence?</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> I don't think I do badly</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> I think you do wonderfully!</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> In terms of voltageI think I did well there!<br> </p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> It's just a different style, isn't it?</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> Hmm. Is it? I don't know. I would say Robert De Niro's style is much more different, I wouldn't say Mickey and mine's was so different.</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> Are you conscious of revealing too much of yourself. Your safety net in the end is based upon things from your own life. Sometimes taking skins off can be a dangerous business.</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> Yeah. Quite often I didn't do it, for that reason.</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> Can you sense, as a performer, when you taken one too many skins off.</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> Yup. </p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> What do you do about it?</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> You lick your wounds a bit. Stay at home.</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> Let's talk about your wonderful portrayal of Miss Havisham. The trouble with Miss Havisham is that everybody has in mind David Lean's version of Great Expectations. Did you consciously think what am I going to do in this that isn't going to be David Lean's Miss Havisham? This old, sad, mad woman surrounded by the relics of the marriage that never was.</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> No, because the screenplay was not that. I met all the people concerned who wanted to make that into something moreI think they wanted to put a bit of sex into Miss Havisham. She might have been dried up, but they did want to make her a bit sexy. That's what they said. \"I'm yer girl, then,\" I said!</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> That final line in that scene (Miss Havisham is told that she is going to marry after all) I think is wonderful. I can't think of any other way of doing it. You must have planned</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> \"Love\"?</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> Yes.</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> You don't plan, but you know that certain lines hold immense power and immense depth, and you just hope that you're going to put what is needed behind the words. If words don't have vibration behind them, and a real feeling behind them, then they're just words. Some words are very beautiful and that word is one of the most beautiful, it's been bandied around a million times, but if you can really say it in the context of a character like Miss Havisham then it's very satisfying.</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> I wonder if you feel that one of the problems for a female actor is that the parts don't come after a certain age. Until you become a character actress</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> So how long do I have to wait?</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> I wondered if you were conscious of being offered a lot of things that you really don't want to do because they're not very interesting.</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> Well, I'm probably lucky because I'm not someone who wants to work very much! So I always feel that there is a role around for me, though I might have to wait around for nine months or a year, but I don't mind that.</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> And preferably a role with a risk attached?</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> Yeah. So I suppose if you really wanted to work a lot I suppose I could say yeah, where are the roles for women my age, but they seem to comeThis one in Under The Sand, Fran\u00e7ois Ozon said, \"No-one will want to do this role because I want to film you exactly as you are. No French film actor is going to want to do it. They're not going to want to be a) in a bathing costume and b) not very well lit, c) looking pretty terrible and all that. I want to film a woman as a woman is at your age.\"<br> </p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> He also said he wanted to film \"the beauty of wrinkle\". So in a sense the romantic in him is there too. There is something romantic about his work.</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> I think that when a young man of thirty-two wants to film a woman of fifty, there is something very romantic about that. He wants to film something that is not necessarily pleasing all the time, but is certainly fulfilling. So a fulfilled woman sometimes looks beautiful, and sometimes doesn't look so beautiful, but you don't have to worry about that because it's all in a dayIn a day, from the moment you wake up in the morning until the moment you go to bed, all sorts of different faces happen, and that's what he wanted. He wanted very much for the actress not to worry about anything like: \"Have I got the right angle?\" or \"Is my stomach showing?\" or \"Can you see my double chin?\"</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> And you didn't?</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> Noof course I didn't</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> Let's ask the audience. </p> <p><strong>Question one:</strong> I think you were high voltage in Angel Heart. What was it like working with Paul Newman on The Verdict?</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> He was high voltage. I kind of like this voltage thing we're on. He is somebody so shy and fragile. You have to be very gentle with him, perhaps you wouldn't think it. He's very self-doubting, an immensely humane man. It was the most extraordinary experience working with him, just on a human basis, I find him an exquisite human being.</p> <p><strong>Question two:</strong> You made a film called He Died With His Eyes Open, what was your experience of that?</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> I thought it was pretty amazing, that film. I really did. As a dark, dark film. It was Robin Cook who wrote the bookdid it get released in England? Yes. It was also working with Michelle Serot, who is one of the finest French actors I think. He started on comedy and became a tremendous dramatic artist. It was one of the darkest films I've made, actually, in terms of the story and in terms of the weight. I saw it recently, I don't really watch my films, but I saw it because it was re-released somewhere.</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> Was it well received in France?</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> Yeah. Very well received. Very dark film. One of Jacques Deray's very good films, he's quite an unequal director, Jacques Deray.</p> <p><strong>Question three:</strong> What do you want, as a person, to happen to Marie at the end?</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> What I feel is that she has come to accept that he husband has died. She has the evidence, the body is there, she knows that. When she sees the watch, she knows that it's her husband because you can't possibly tell from the body. She's not going to be able to stay for very long with the pain of crying and she realises that she has to mourn. When she runs off she maybe invents the fact that it might be her husband, but she knows it's not and she will eventually come to terms with the death of her husband. She will accept it. That's what I feel.</p> <p><strong>Question four:</strong> She won't end up in an asylum like her mother-in-law?</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> No way, because she's far too proud!</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> Is she going to marry Vincent?</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> No. Vincent is still too \"leger.\"</p> <p><strong>Question five: </strong>What did Fran\u00e7ois Ozon need to learn, that he needed two female writers?</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> I just felt that it needed to have a woman's femininity in it somewhere. I didn't know what at all, or what it would reveal, but when Emmanuel Bernheim came in, something else started to happen, I don't know what it was, but something else happened. I think that collaboration in writing is very important, with male or female writers, but if the subject is uniquely about a woman, I think there's something out of balance if there's not a woman that comes in and collaborates with the writing.</p> <p><strong>Question six: </strong> How important is it for you for a film to be a commercial success?</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> I'm over the moon, actually, because there are 500,000 people in Paris that have seen Under The Sand. Quite often the films I make are difficult, a certain amount of people have seen them and they've been critically appreciated and respected, but to have a commercial success with a film like this - which is not an easy film, it's a very personal film, people's own story will be revealed a little bit through this film - it's something that makes me feel as if I've been recognised somewhere.</p> <p><strong>Question seven:</strong> You play women with secrets very often. Do you find secrets, and characters with secrets, attractive?</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> I think what we do best, in the artistic world, are the things where we're handicapped. I'm not very good at talking and being with people, and being gregarious and outgoing. I love people, but I have great difficulty doing it. I think the reason I have secrets is because there are a lot of things I haven't been able to let out and I'm able to let them out through the screen and this medium. </p> <p>I'm able to let them out in a way that if I'd been able to let them out before in a more easy, normal way it wouldn't be so effective. I think that all us people who perform and are called artists are usually very crippled people, and we use this to uncripple ourselves for a little bit of time. When people want to see your film you're over the moon because you've actually made real contact. That's something very special.</p> <p><strong>Question eight:</strong> Who is the best director that you've worked with?</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> It's like comparing children. You can't do that. These directors are so much part of me - they've made me and helped me along the way. Some better than othersbut they've all been incredibly kind to me. Maybe they all realised that they wouldn't get anything out of me if they were unkind! I'm not answering your question in the way that you want me to because I find it difficult to be specific in that way.</p> <p>It's a kind of idealistic love that I have with all these directors. They're figureheads for me. They've been part of such an essential part of my life, just for a short amount of time, but they're mythological gods up there for me. That's the way I like to feel about them, because that's the way I like to feel about my work.</p> <p><strong>Question nine:</strong> Were you nervous about performing for these great directors?</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> No, because they're all part of my family.

      "bodyText": "Charlotte Rampling on: Angel Heart | Mickey Rourke | Great Expectations | difficulty of finding roles for older actresses | Paul Newman | He Died With His Eyes Open | directors Christopher Cook: When the script for Angel Heart arrived, what made you think you really wanted to play Margaret Krusemark in the film? It's a very small, cameo performance on one level. Charlotte Rampling: First of all because of Alan Parker, who is a friend, I've known him a long time and I admire him enormously, and then it was Mickey Rourke, and then it was the fascinating screenplay and it became irresistible. Even if it was just one big scene, you're always talking about this women, this woman holds tremendous power through the film. The film is quite astounding really. CC: That's the point, it's her film. CR: Almost, yeah, although she's hardly ever there. CC: When you play that scene, you're competing with an astonishing set, crammed with detail. I wonder how easy it is acting with, but against, the d\u00e9cor. CR: Well, you just don't think about it. You'd very quickly drown otherwise. CC: It must be quite alarming to have that sort of detail around you. CR: I don't actually look very much. I think, in a sense, it's a pity, but that's the only way I can protect myself in this business. I just look to the essential of what I have to look at, and the rest I don't see. People will say, \"Did you see that?\" I will say, \"No. I actually didn't.\" So if you say to me that room was very decorated, I had no idea that it was. It's also like that with the technicians, and all the movement and the agitation and the razzamatazz that goes around on a day's filming, if I connect into what is really happening then I'll lose what I need to be able to do what I have to do. So I blank out a lot of stuff. CC: Was it fun to work with Rourke? CR: Yeah. He was wonderful then too, he was really good, he was well and he was happy and it was a good moment in his life. He became a very good friend, yup. CC: In terms of performing, what made it good to be with him at that moment? CR: Because he is a highly instinctive, sensual actor and at that time he was at the peak of all that. He was quite remarkable. He just vibrated. He's not clever like a De Niro, who he was acting with, but he had great gifts. Has great gifts. He hasn't done much now, but then he was at the peak of his power, of his sensuality, of his animal side, of his instinctive side. Alan is a very powerful director, so he was able to keep him there, chain him in there and not let him go from there. Whereas if he's allowed to go on his own, he then gets out of control. CC: It's an American style of acting that some people call \"spit and sawdust.\" It couldn't be more different than your style. Because it's so overwhelming, Rourke's style, when it works, 200,000 volts in one person, how difficult is it to maintain your presence? CR: I don't think I do badly CC: I think you do wonderfully! CR: In terms of voltageI think I did well there! CC: It's just a different style, isn't it? CR: Hmm. Is it? I don't know. I would say Robert De Niro's style is much more different, I wouldn't say Mickey and mine's was so different. CC: Are you conscious of revealing too much of yourself. Your safety net in the end is based upon things from your own life. Sometimes taking skins off can be a dangerous business. CR: Yeah. Quite often I didn't do it, for that reason. CC: Can you sense, as a performer, when you taken one too many skins off. CR: Yup. CC: What do you do about it? CR: You lick your wounds a bit. Stay at home. CC: Let's talk about your wonderful portrayal of Miss Havisham. The trouble with Miss Havisham is that everybody has in mind David Lean's version of Great Expectations. Did you consciously think what am I going to do in this that isn't going to be David Lean's Miss Havisham? This old, sad, mad woman surrounded by the relics of the marriage that never was. CR: No, because the screenplay was not that. I met all the people concerned who wanted to make that into something moreI think they wanted to put a bit of sex into Miss Havisham. She might have been dried up, but they did want to make her a bit sexy. That's what they said. \"I'm yer girl, then,\" I said! CC: That final line in that scene (Miss Havisham is told that she is going to marry after all) I think is wonderful. I can't think of any other way of doing it. You must have planned CR: \"Love\"? CC: Yes. CR: You don't plan, but you know that certain lines hold immense power and immense depth, and you just hope that you're going to put what is needed behind the words. If words don't have vibration behind them, and a real feeling behind them, then they're just words. Some words are very beautiful and that word is one of the most beautiful, it's been bandied around a million times, but if you can really say it in the context of a character like Miss Havisham then it's very satisfying. CC: I wonder if you feel that one of the problems for a female actor is that the parts don't come after a certain age. Until you become a character actress CR: So how long do I have to wait? CC: I wondered if you were conscious of being offered a lot of things that you really don't want to do because they're not very interesting. CR: Well, I'm probably lucky because I'm not someone who wants to work very much! So I always feel that there is a role around for me, though I might have to wait around for nine months or a year, but I don't mind that. CC: And preferably a role with a risk attached? CR: Yeah. So I suppose if you really wanted to work a lot I suppose I could say yeah, where are the roles for women my age, but they seem to comeThis one in Under The Sand, Fran\u00e7ois Ozon said, \"No-one will want to do this role because I want to film you exactly as you are. No French film actor is going to want to do it. They're not going to want to be a) in a bathing costume and b) not very well lit, c) looking pretty terrible and all that. I want to film a woman as a woman is at your age.\" CC: He also said he wanted to film \"the beauty of wrinkle\". So in a sense the romantic in him is there too. There is something romantic about his work. CR: I think that when a young man of thirty-two wants to film a woman of fifty, there is something very romantic about that. He wants to film something that is not necessarily pleasing all the time, but is certainly fulfilling. So a fulfilled woman sometimes looks beautiful, and sometimes doesn't look so beautiful, but you don't have to worry about that because it's all in a dayIn a day, from the moment you wake up in the morning until the moment you go to bed, all sorts of different faces happen, and that's what he wanted. He wanted very much for the actress not to worry about anything like: \"Have I got the right angle?\" or \"Is my stomach showing?\" or \"Can you see my double chin?\" CC: And you didn't? CR: Noof course I didn't CC: Let's ask the audience. Question one: I think you were high voltage in Angel Heart. What was it like working with Paul Newman on The Verdict? CR: He was high voltage. I kind of like this voltage thing we're on. He is somebody so shy and fragile. You have to be very gentle with him, perhaps you wouldn't think it. He's very self-doubting, an immensely humane man. It was the most extraordinary experience working with him, just on a human basis, I find him an exquisite human being. Question two: You made a film called He Died With His Eyes Open, what was your experience of that? CR: I thought it was pretty amazing, that film. I really did. As a dark, dark film. It was Robin Cook who wrote the bookdid it get released in England? Yes. It was also working with Michelle Serot, who is one of the finest French actors I think. He started on comedy and became a tremendous dramatic artist. It was one of the darkest films I've made, actually, in terms of the story and in terms of the weight. I saw it recently, I don't really watch my films, but I saw it because it was re-released somewhere. CC: Was it well received in France? CR: Yeah. Very well received. Very dark film. One of Jacques Deray's very good films, he's quite an unequal director, Jacques Deray. Question three: What do you want, as a person, to happen to Marie at the end? CR: What I feel is that she has come to accept that he husband has died. She has the evidence, the body is there, she knows that. When she sees the watch, she knows that it's her husband because you can't possibly tell from the body. She's not going to be able to stay for very long with the pain of crying and she realises that she has to mourn. When she runs off she maybe invents the fact that it might be her husband, but she knows it's not and she will eventually come to terms with the death of her husband. She will accept it. That's what I feel. Question four: She won't end up in an asylum like her mother-in-law? CR: No way, because she's far too proud! CC: Is she going to marry Vincent? CR: No. Vincent is still too \"leger.\" Question five: What did Fran\u00e7ois Ozon need to learn, that he needed two female writers? CR: I just felt that it needed to have a woman's femininity in it somewhere. I didn't know what at all, or what it would reveal, but when Emmanuel Bernheim came in, something else started to happen, I don't know what it was, but something else happened. I think that collaboration in writing is very important, with male or female writers, but if the subject is uniquely about a woman, I think there's something out of balance if there's not a woman that comes in and collaborates with the writing. Question six: How important is it for you for a film to be a commercial success? CR: I'm over the moon, actually, because there are 500,000 people in Paris that have seen Under The Sand. Quite often the films I make are difficult, a certain amount of people have seen them and they've been critically appreciated and respected, but to have a commercial success with a film like this - which is not an easy film, it's a very personal film, people's own story will be revealed a little bit through this film - it's something that makes me feel as if I've been recognised somewhere. Question seven: You play women with secrets very often. Do you find secrets, and characters with secrets, attractive? CR: I think what we do best, in the artistic world, are the things where we're handicapped. I'm not very good at talking and being with people, and being gregarious and outgoing. I love people, but I have great difficulty doing it. I think the reason I have secrets is because there are a lot of things I haven't been able to let out and I'm able to let them out through the screen and this medium. I'm able to let them out in a way that if I'd been able to let them out before in a more easy, normal way it wouldn't be so effective. I think that all us people who perform and are called artists are usually very crippled people, and we use this to uncripple ourselves for a little bit of time. When people want to see your film you're over the moon because you've actually made real contact. That's something very special. Question eight: Who is the best director that you've worked with? CR: It's like comparing children. You can't do that. These directors are so much part of me - they've made me and helped me along the way. Some better than othersbut they've all been incredibly kind to me. Maybe they all realised that they wouldn't get anything out of me if they were unkind! I'm not answering your question in the way that you want me to because I find it difficult to be specific in that way. It's a kind of idealistic love that I have with all these directors. They're figureheads for me. They've been part of such an essential part of my life, just for a short amount of time, but they're mythological gods up there for me. That's the way I like to feel about them, because that's the way I like to feel about my work. Question nine: Were you nervous about performing for these great directors? CR: No, because they're all part of my family. I don't think better or worse. The comparison thing for me has never worked in anything. I don't compare things. Question ten: Why is the film called Under The Sand? CR: What confuses you? Question eleven: I don't understand what is under the sand. CR: Well, he could be, couldn't he? The title was actually going to be the title of a short film Ozon made which was then called Regarde La Mer, but they changed titles. In France they asked about the title too. And it really annoyed Fran\u00e7ois! I'll tell him - there's another one! Question twelve: What was Robert Mitchum like in Farewell My Lovely? CR: He was fantastic, yeah. He's the last of the great Hollywood myths. And he really lives up to it. Question thirteen: What do you think about the look you created in Night Porter becoming so fashionable? CR: I haven't got my braces on todayWhat do I think about it? I think it's good. No, I do - when things go into fashion it means they're important, doesn't it Christopher? CC: I'm just imagining you at home trying on the costume CR: I do wear braces every now and then. Madonna wanted Dirk Bogarde to be in her video CC: Are you going to tell us what he said? CR: Umno. CC: I think that's one of the great lost lines of dialogue. Charlotte Rampling, thank you very much indeed. CR: Thank you. \u0095 Back to top of article.",

Fran\u00e7ois Ozon, whose work I was beginning to discover a few months before, came to me via my agent and said that he had this idea, which was just the first part of the film until the husband disappears, because it was something he himself witnessed when he was a boy of twelve. He was haunted by this idea and it so happens that at the age of thirty-two he was looking for someone who would be able to follow, to find out what happened to this woman that he saw pack her little bag with the towels and the beach ball, and go home and never really know what happened to her husband. So, that's the story. We filmed the first part, up to where the husband disappeared, then we stopped filming and then he wrote the screenplay.</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> But there must have been something about the story that caught your imagination as an actor?</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> I think because it was so incredibly difficult to imagine what could possibly happen, and how we could put that across on the screen. How could you actually make interesting what this woman was going through after such an experience? More and more as Fran\u00e7ois Ozon wrote the screenplay, more and more he didn't want anything to happen - he just wanted to film it through the eyes of the woman.</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> Being there while the screenplay was being written, did you get an opportunity to shape what was happening to Marie?</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> Yes, because I was his blueprint - the essence of what could happen in this very fragile story because there was no plot particularly, it was just about \"a being.\" Perhaps you feel it when you see this film, this film is more an experience than actually seeing a film, it's a very personal thing for everybody. The people that are affected by the film, and they seemed to be quite affected in France, if you are affected by it then it becomes your story.</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> Was there a sense in which you felt that the feminine aspect of the character needed a little help that perhaps you could bring in?</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> Well, there was never a question of me collaborating on the writing, but I very much collaborated with him in terms of ideas. At one moment I said to him that I thought it necessary for him to collaborate with a woman writer and so he worked with two women on the writing at one stage.</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> When you first see this film it doesn't seem to be a long, strong narrative, it seems to be about a woman trying to come to terms with the inexplicable loss of her husband Jean. But the film plays on your mind and isn't about that at all, it's not about mourning the loss of a husband really, is it?</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> No, that's the pretext of the story. Quite often in life, when a tragic event arrives it becomes a springboard for mirroring all other things in one's life that one hasn't come to terms with. To grieve is something extremely difficult, we don't even know how to begin to grieve, and I don't know how you can be taught to grieve. But it's how to come to terms with suffering, that's what it's really about - not to resist it, not to deny it, but to accept it - but we don't really want to do that because it's too painful.</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> Also a woman who is emotionally shipwrecked by an event. She loses all sense of bearing and it's an attempt to recover a sense of identity.</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> Yeah. I don't know, I sort of feel that, the way we go through life, these moments are necessary in different shapes and forms because they are what will make us understand more about why we're here and what we are doing in life and why we're actually alive. Quite often we're just trundling along and we think, well, it's sort of OK let's hope it stays OK, but it never really does stay OK. When life hits you very hard it's the biggest challenge. So each challenge is how we're going to accept these challenges. So we watch Marie come to terms, or not, with this. We watch how she goes along the way to become, perhaps, to that accepting form at the end of the film.</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> There's that savage scene towards the end of the film with her mother-in-law, which is I think the most vicious, psychological scene between two women on the screen that I've seen for a long time. Was that tough to do?</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> Memories of Bette Davis and Joan Crawford</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> You said it, not me!</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> I saw it in your eye! Well, it was positive, because it made Marie really resolve and say, \"Fuck her,\", that body is your son - she didn't know if it was, but she's going to tell that woman it was him in the net, and she says, \"Oh. But he never liked fishing! How strange!\"</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> You're competing with an actress in that scene who, like you, knows exactly where to position herself in relation to the camera. So it becomes a great duel between two powerful actors as well as two powerful women.</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> Yeah, that's what cinema is about. Good cinema can be like that.</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> I'm curious about the end. Should we suppose that there really is Jean there on the end of the beach or are we deliberately not supposed to make up our minds, and what does Marie think?</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> Well I think you've got to be as confused as Marie. I'm sorry!</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> Going back to the beginning of your career, did you always know that you wanted to act?</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> No, but I knew I wanted to be somewhere in the limelight, I knew I wanted to be up there somewhere. But acting, I didn't really think about it. I thought about singing but that become impossible because my father didn't want that. Acting came, sort of, out of the blue.</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> Acting was all right with your parents but singing wasn't?</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> Singing was rather daring because it meant rather short skirts and cabaret, because this was before discotheques you see, so I would have been a cabaret artiste. And I was only sixteen and still at school.</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> You studied at The Royal Court with William Gaskill and George Devine. What did you learn from these two great men of the British theatre?</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> Certainly, with George Devine, I learnt stillness, I learnt actually that movement wasn't necessary and you could convey all - we worked a lot with masks - through being still. That was enormous as a lesson, I certainly learnt that through him.</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> Do you think it's important for a cinema actor to have that sort of stagecraft?</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> I don't know, because I didn't do it</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> But the training</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> I think all training is wonderful and great, it's always useful. I regret not having enough training, I trained for a year at The Royal Court, but I very quickly went off to do films and television. Training is fabulous because it gives you a basis, a strong structure, so that when you're unbelievably nervous and you think that you can't get a word out, you will get the word out. Something is structured within you, that's what the training has given you, and it will come out.</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> After Georgy Girl you might have spent your career making English pictures, but very quickly you became interesting to European directors - you worked with Visconti on The Damned. Was that something that you'd wanted to do, get into European cinema?</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> No, but what I wanted to do I was researching psychologically what's the word not disturbed, but psychologically rich people whose inner world could have a voice. The films that were being offered to me in the early sixties in England were very much dollybirds, and girls following plots, and girlfriend of the hero and that sort of thing. So it was through Italy that I found the roles I needed.</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> Did you find Visconti, or did he find you to play Elizabeth Thallman in The Damned?</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> He found me. He'd seen me in Georgy girl and he'd seen me in the first Italian picture I did, Sequestro di Persona, called Kidnapped in England. He'd seen those two films.</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> What was he like as a director?</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> He became my master. He illustrated all that I imagined cinema could be. I didn't know much about cinema, I didn't have a culture in cinema, I hadn't had theatre training, I wasn't particularly educated in the cinema world and I didn't even know who Visconti was. He showed me a particular type of cinema, which became my matrix, which became the way I wanted to make films. I've never really deviated - they're not all Visconti-type films, but the essence, the quality, the style is what I've always looked for.</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> When he was on set with you, what would he be asking from you and the other actors?<br> </p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> I said to him, \"Look. I can't play this role,\" when I first met him. She's a woman of thirty and I'm twenty-three and here I am with my hair all over the place in a mini-skirt and I just don't know how this woman suffers. She's got two children and it's an incredible story and I said I didn't know how to do it. He said, \"I know that you can do it. Will you trust me?\" It was really sweet, and the idea of me turning down Visconti - well, I realised the extent of my youthful madness.</p> <p>He said, \"I know you can do it,\" and I said, \"How?\" and he said, \"I can see it behind your eyes. Just listen to me. I'm going to make you up, I'm going to change your style, I'm going to make you look like a woman in her thirties, you're going to have beautiful clothes, a beautiful set, you're going to have beautiful people around you. I'm going to put you into this place and you're going to have to do what you have to do. I can't act for you. I can do everything else for you, but I can't act for you. Will you act for me?\" I said, \"Senor, si! Grazia!\" And I did.</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> What you describe is similar to what other people have said - the absolute fascination with detail. There is a famous story about when he was shooting Ludwig where he sent his favourite designer back to Rome because he didn't like the coachman's buttons. Did you feel that once you were there on the set, that he wasn't going to tell you much about how to do it?</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> It depends. With Helmut Berger he was an absolute tyrant. He told Helmut every single thing to do. Everything. Every movement. But with the women, he was - I don't know how he was with Ingrid Thulin because we didn't have so many scenes together - certainly with me and Romy Schneider, he just puts you in this most incredible situation where you feel like a princess and you're absolutely loved, and you're dressed and you're made-up and he says, \"Just now act for me.\" And with his women it was like that. With the men it was very different.</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> That was the first time you worked with Dirk Bogarde. We saw a clip of one of your most notable partnerships, The Night Porter. What were Bogarde's strengths as an actor to work with? What did he bring to the relationship?</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> Certainly endurance. He never gave up. If ever for a moment I got tired, or looked depressed he would just literally pick me up by the scruff of my neck, sit me down and say, \"You never ever admit that you feel tired because you have to be ready for one minute at any time in the fourteen or fifteen hours we're working, because that minute will be the one that is eternally on the screen. You prepare for that constantly'.\"</p> <p>He sounded a bit like my father! But he was right, he was absolutely right. You can never go to pieces. It is incredibly strenuous, filming, physically, psychologically, in every way. It's a huge endurance test because you do have to be absolutely there for one minute. That's all it is - three minutes a day, filming. That's all you do. There is a lot of irritation and difficulty and waiting and being uncomfortable in your make-up and costume, and you just want to get out, but you can't. You must be ready for that one moment. He very much taught me about that and helped me in that film and certainly I never forgot that.</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> Both you and Bogarde are very English in one sense, as actors, but somehow terribly un-English too. It becomes rather dangerous. Am I overstating this, or did you have a sense of that?</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> Dangerous in what sense?</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> It doesn't have the neatness and order of most English acting.<br> </p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> After Dirk left the Rank organization and went to live in Italy and then in France, he was in his early forties at that time, he made his break with that. I made my break with that when I was twenty-three and decided that I needed to find characters that weren't in English cinema at that time. In that sense we were on a parallel. </p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> How did you prepare yourself for the part of Lucia Atherton in The Night Porter? Did you think your way into the terrifying history of this woman who had been in the camps during the holocaust?</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> We started filming the concentration camp sequences in a disinfected TB hospital outside Rome. I'd decided not to think about this story until I started. It was such a violent start I was just propelled into it. I can't describe it.</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> In approaching a part, do you need to research it and have lots of external things that you know?</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> No, because I dare to believe that I've got it somewhere in me. I dare to take that risk.</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> High wire walking, isn't it?</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> Yeah, but it hasn't proved too bad, has it?</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> Do you ever worry you might fall?</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> Of course I do, all the time, but that's the fun! Free-form, no net.</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> What can you put as a net beneath you?</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> What can you put? You put things of your life there.</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> So you've got things to draw on?</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> Yes. You've got your family, your children, your husband, your home, you put that. That's what holds a lot of stuff so you don't fall off and crash to the ground. There must be a sense of reality, the things you've really created, which is your home and your children.<br> </p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> How much do you want the director to offer you things to hold on to and how much do you want to listen to what you think he or she wants and then do it?</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> Well, he really is the ringmaster. In a sense I have to be at his command, but not in a submissive way or a puppet-like way, but I must feel that I am going to perform uniquely for him. I have to be sure that he really knows that so that he knows the risk I am taking.</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> So there is a very important trust from the very beginning?</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> Yes.</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> Do you like rehearsals?</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> No. I don't like rehearsals. That's probably why I don't do theatre. I don't like repeating things. </p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> Is that because in the end there is only one way of doing it?</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> Gosh, I don't know, that would be terrible to think, wouldn't it? That there's only one way of doing it. But I think I probably think that, yeah. And when I've got it, I don't ever want to do it again. Or I'm too frightened not to be able to get it. Or perhaps I'm not trained enough - had I had a training I think you think differently. I don't think you can think like the way I'm saying, that it can only be once, if you've had a theatrical training because you know you can get it again. But my training is instinctive and it's my training, it's what I've taught myself as I've gone along as to how to get the effect that I want.</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> Do you think that's a kind of nakedness? The technique that you might have acquired if you'd gone through \"great British acting institutions\" would have created a superstructure around you, but you don't have that.</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> No. I have always avoided it, not consciously, except for The Royal Court, which I loved, and the work I did with George Devine. Improvisation work, for example, we did there, and that was wonderful for me. You just had to get up in front of the class and do things. The teacher would say make us laugh, make us cry, make us believe in this. Make us believe in a way that children do. That's very powerful and useful. But anything that's formal, any kind of formal, institutionalised training - and anything institutionalised in life - I always end up avoiding that, and doing something else.</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> Many people would treasure the film Zardoz most, what was it like working with John Boorman?</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> Who would treasure most?</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> Those who'd admired your careerwell, I think that. Alright, I'm speaking for myself</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> Is he? Is he speaking for himself? That surprises me. Zardoz?</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> You don't regard that as something special in your career?</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> I don't know what I regard as special too much, I'm not the best judge. It just made me laugh, I don't know why. It's a funny film, a mixture of all sorts of things.</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> It just goes to show that critics are always wrong.</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> I'm certainly not the one who can judge all of that.</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> It seems to me that you find a completely different style of acting. There you are, with Sean Connery in an all-muscles role, and you cease to be this strange, dark creature and it's another actress altogether.</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> Hmm.</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> No? Well, passing lightly over Orca Killer Whale, let's talk about Stardust Memories</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> Just as well I had Orca Killer Whale, otherwise not a child in the world would know who I was. They couldn't see any of my films. What could my sons see? Well, they saw Orca. And they jolly well enjoyed it, it was a lovely film.</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> Did Woody Allen casting you in Stardust Memories come out of the blue?&lt;BR</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> No, he called my agent up. He was in Paris and I saw him and we had a very odd interview. I was sitting there, and he was asking me these rather odd questions and at the end he said, \"How do you feel about being my ideal woman?\" I said, \"Well, I love the idea,\" and he said, \"Well, OK.\" So I ended up doing the film.</p> <p>At the time, I had just had a baby and I said to Woody that I couldn't do the film - a pretty agonizing decision but I couldn't leave all my family because he wanted me in New York for five months, because he said it was going to be \"an experimental film.\" I talked to the producer, and the producer said if that was really the case thenWoody got back on the phone and said what can we do? I said, \"I don't know,\" and he said, \"Bring the family over.\" I said, \"I can't bring the family over, I've got three children and a husband, I can't bring everybody over to New York and live there for five months.\" So he said, \"Well what can we do?\" and I said, \"Will you let me come and go?\" - in American productions they never let you come and go, especially the studios in Hollywood - so they allowed me to do that. On the Concorde I came and went.</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> What did he mean when he said my ideal women? Was it just tongue in cheek?</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> No. No, no it wasn't. His ideal woman is absolutely completely bonkers for twenty-eight days of the month, and fantastic for two or three, but so fantastic you get through the other twenty-eight when she's completely out of her skull.</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> When he was working on set, did he direct in a way that was quite unusual compared to what you were used to?</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> He went on and on and on. He said, 'Right. We're going to improvise. You can do what you want.' You could not change a word. So you did things in various ways, but always his way completely. </p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> Was he allowed to improvise?</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> Well, yeah. He did a lot of improvising, but you weren't allowed to do any improvising at all. But you were bathed in the illusion that you were improvising like mad, but actually you were not changing a word of anything, not even a movement, because he would tell you exactly how he wanted you to move, which was very sweet.</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> Was the script written so that there was only one way of doing it? You sound like Charlotte Rampling as a Woody Allen leading lady - the lines don't end, there's an upbeat on the end of the line - is that the way it's written or is that the way you find yourself performing for him?</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> When you work with a director you become like a chameleon. The process of filmmaking is very musical, you get into the rhythm and the rhythmics of how someone is, especially with Woody Allen who is very much into body language and body movement. So it's a kind of mimicry that happens very quickly, you are getting into his rhythm because that's the way he wants you to be in the film. If he wanted you to be very different, you could be very different, but he wanted me to undergo osmosis with him, become the same person. So you just get into that rhythm.</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> That becomes even more obvious in the sequence where the two of you are in the apartment and the pigeon comes in. When you saw the film, were you surprised at what had happened?</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> [Laughing] I'm just remembering the sceneWas I surprised? No. I don't know. I suppose I'm always a bit surprised, yeah, when I see the films.</p> <p><strong>CC:</strong> Although he insisted that you kept to the script, quite a lot of things happened when he started to construct the film afterwards, so perhaps what you thought you were doing wasn't what you ended up doing.</p> <p><strong>CR:</strong> Well, he said that it was going to be \"an experimental film,\" and this meant that a few times I came back and we'd do five versions of a scene. </p> <p>For instance, the scene where Dorrie breaks down, we couldn't get how to show somebody breaking down. We did this scene in a clinic, then we were here, then we were there, then it was me, looking depressed and all this. Every time it didn't work. The final time he called me back and said just sit down, with a black background, and said, \"I've got all this text. Just read it, or learn it. Do something with it. Say all these words to the camera.\" As I was saying them something happened with the camera, I don't know the technical word, but the frame freezes for a minute and so it sort of stops. That became the scene. It was a mistake. He was doing something and it did that. That's how things happen. You find things, and that is the magic of films - so often it's out of your control. The most beautiful things happen.</p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"/Film/interview/interviewpages/0,6737,457892,00.html\">To next page</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Charlotte Rampling on: Under the sand | early career | Luchino Visconti | Dirk Bogarde | acting technique | Woody Allen and Stardust Memories Christopher Cook: What was it that you liked about the script of Under the Sand that made you want to take the part of Marie? Charlotte Rampling: It wasn't a script at all, it was just an idea. Fran\u00e7ois Ozon, whose work I was beginning to discover a few months before, came to me via my agent and said that he had this idea, which was just the first part of the film until the husband disappears, because it was something he himself witnessed when he was a boy of twelve. He was haunted by this idea and it so happens that at the age of thirty-two he was looking for someone who would be able to follow, to find out what happened to this woman that he saw pack her little bag with the towels and the beach ball, and go home and never really know what happened to her husband. So, that's the story. We filmed the first part, up to where the husband disappeared, then we stopped filming and then he wrote the screenplay. CC: But there must have been something about the story that caught your imagination as an actor?

CR: Yes, because I was his blueprint - the essence of what could happen in this very fragile story because there was no plot particularly, it was just about \"a being.\" Perhaps you feel it when you see this film, this film is more an experience than actually seeing a film, it's a very personal thing for everybody. The people that are affected by the film, and they seemed to be quite affected in France, if you are affected by it then it becomes your story. CC: Was there a sense in which you felt that the feminine aspect of the character needed a little help that perhaps you could bring in? CR: Well, there was never a question of me collaborating on the writing, but I very much collaborated with him in terms of ideas. At one moment I said to him that I thought it necessary for him to collaborate with a woman writer and so he worked with two women on the writing at one stage. CC: When you first see this film it doesn't seem to be a long, strong narrative, it seems to be about a woman trying to come to terms with the inexplicable loss of her husband Jean. But the film plays on your mind and isn't about that at all, it's not about mourning the loss of a husband really, is it? CR: No, that's the pretext of the story. Quite often in life, when a tragic event arrives it becomes a springboard for mirroring all other things in one's life that one hasn't come to terms with. To grieve is something extremely difficult, we don't even know how to begin to grieve, and I don't know how you can be taught to grieve. But it's how to come to terms with suffering, that's what it's really about - not to resist it, not to deny it, but to accept it - but we don't really want to do that because it's too painful. CC: Also a woman who is emotionally shipwrecked by an event. She loses all sense of bearing and it's an attempt to recover a sense of identity. CR: Yeah. I don't know, I sort of feel that, the way we go through life, these moments are necessary in different shapes and forms because they are what will make us understand more about why we're here and what we are doing in life and why we're actually alive. Quite often we're just trundling along and we think, well, it's sort of OK let's hope it stays OK, but it never really does stay OK. When life hits you very hard it's the biggest challenge. So each challenge is how we're going to accept these challenges. So we watch Marie come to terms, or not, with this. We watch how she goes along the way to become, perhaps, to that accepting form at the end of the film. CC: There's that savage scene towards the end of the film with her mother-in-law, which is I think the most vicious, psychological scene between two women on the screen that I've seen for a long time. Was that tough to do? CR: Memories of Bette Davis and Joan Crawford CC: You said it, not me! CR: I saw it in your eye! Well, it was positive, because it made Marie really resolve and say, \"Fuck her,\", that body is your son - she didn't know if it was, but she's going to tell that woman it was him in the net, and she says, \"Oh. But he never liked fishing! How strange!\" CC: You're competing with an actress in that scene who, like you, knows exactly where to position herself in relation to the camera.

That was enormous as a lesson, I certainly learnt that through him. CC: Do you think it's important for a cinema actor to have that sort of stagecraft? CR: I don't know, because I didn't do it CC: But the training CR: I think all training is wonderful and great, it's always useful. I regret not having enough training, I trained for a year at The Royal Court, but I very quickly went off to do films and television. Training is fabulous because it gives you a basis, a strong structure, so that when you're unbelievably nervous and you think that you can't get a word out, you will get the word out. Something is structured within you, that's what the training has given you, and it will come out.

He'd seen me in Georgy girl and he'd seen me in the first Italian picture I did, Sequestro di Persona, called Kidnapped in England. He'd seen those two films. CC: What was he like as a director? CR: He became my master. He illustrated all that I imagined cinema could be. I didn't know much about cinema, I didn't have a culture in cinema, I hadn't had theatre training, I wasn't particularly educated in the cinema world and I didn't even know who Visconti was. He showed me a particular type of cinema, which became my matrix, which became the way I wanted to make films. I've never really deviated - they're not all Visconti-type films, but the essence, the quality, the style is what I've always looked for. CC: When he was on set with you, what would he be asking from you and the other actors? CR: I said to him, \"Look. I can't play this role,\" when I first met him. She's a woman of thirty and I'm twenty-three and here I am with my hair all over the place in a mini-skirt and I just don't know how this woman suffers. She's got two children and it's an incredible story and I said I didn't know how to do it. He said, \"I know that you can do it. Will you trust me?\" It was really sweet, and the idea of me turning down Visconti - well, I realised the extent of my youthful madness. He said, \"I know you can do it,\" and I said, \"How?\" and he said, \"I can see it behind your eyes. Just listen to me. I'm going to make you up, I'm going to change your style, I'm going to make you look like a woman in her thirties, you're going to have beautiful clothes, a beautiful set, you're going to have beautiful people around you. I'm going to put you into this place and you're going to have to do what you have to do. I can't act for you. I can do everything else for you, but I can't act for you. Will you act for me?\" I said, \"Senor, si! Grazia!\" And I did. CC: What you describe is similar to what other people have said - the absolute fascination with detail. There is a famous story about when he was shooting Ludwig where he sent his favourite designer back to Rome because he didn't like the coachman's buttons. Did you feel that once you were there on the set, that he wasn't going to tell you much about how to do it? CR: It depends. With Helmut Berger he was an absolute tyrant. He told Helmut every single thing to do. Everything. Every movement. But with the women, he was - I don't know how he was with Ingrid Thulin because we didn't have so many scenes together - certainly with me and Romy Schneider, he just puts you in this most incredible situation where you feel like a princess and you're absolutely loved, and you're dressed and you're made-up and he says, \"Just now act for me.\" And with his women it was like that. With the men it was very different. CC: That was the first time you worked with Dirk Bogarde. We saw a clip of one of your most notable partnerships, The Night Porter. What were Bogarde's strengths as an actor to work with? What did he bring to the relationship? CR: Certainly endurance. He never gave up. If ever for a moment I got tired, or looked depressed he would just literally pick me up by the scruff of my neck, sit me down and say, \"You never ever admit that you feel tired because you have to be ready for one minute at any time in the fourteen or fifteen hours we're working, because that minute will be the one that is eternally on the screen. You prepare for that constantly'.\" He sounded a bit like my father! But he was right, he was absolutely right. You can never go to pieces. It is incredibly strenuous, filming, physically, psychologically, in every way. It's a huge endurance test because you do have to be absolutely there for one minute. That's all it is - three minutes a day, filming. That's all you do. There is a lot of irritation and difficulty and waiting and being uncomfortable in your make-up and costume, and you just want to get out, but you can't. You must be ready for that one moment. He very much taught me about that and helped me in that film and certainly I never forgot that. CC: Both you and Bogarde are very English in one sense, as actors, but somehow terribly un-English too. It becomes rather dangerous. Am I overstating this, or did you have a sense of that? CR: Dangerous in what sense? CC: It doesn't have the neatness and order of most English acting. CR: After Dirk left the Rank organization and went to live in Italy and then in France, he was in his early forties at that time, he made his break with that. I made my break with that when I was twenty-three and decided that I needed to find characters that weren't in English cinema at that time. In that sense we were on a parallel. CC: How did you prepare yourself for the part of Lucia Atherton in The Night Porter? Did you think your way into the terrifying history of this woman who had been in the camps during the holocaust? CR: We started filming the concentration camp sequences in a disinfected TB hospital outside Rome. I'd decided not to think about this story until I started. It was such a violent start I was just propelled into it. I can't describe it. CC: In approaching a part, do you need to research it and have lots of external things that you know? CR: No, because I dare to believe that I've got it somewhere in me. I dare to take that risk. CC: High wire walking, isn't it? CR: Yeah, but it hasn't proved too bad, has it? CC: Do you ever worry you might fall? CR: Of course I do, all the time, but that's the fun! Free-form, no net. CC: What can you put as a net beneath you? CR: What can you put? You put things of your life there. CC: So you've got things to draw on? CR: Yes. You've got your family, your children, your husband, your home, you put that. That's what holds a lot of stuff so you don't fall off and crash to the ground. There must be a sense of reality, the things you've really created, which is your home and your children. CC: How much do you want the director to offer you things to hold on to and how much do you want to listen to what you think he or she wants and then do it? CR: Well, he really is the ringmaster. In a sense I have to be at his command, but not in a submissive way or a puppet-like way, but I must feel that I am going to perform uniquely for him. I have to be sure that he really knows that so that he knows the risk I am taking. CC: So there is a very important trust from the very beginning? CR: Yes. CC: Do you like rehearsals? CR: No. I don't like rehearsals. That's probably why I don't do theatre. I don't like repeating things. CC: Is that because in the end there is only one way of doing it? CR: Gosh, I don't know, that would be terrible to think, wouldn't it? That there's only one way of doing it. But I think I probably think that, yeah. And when I've got it, I don't ever want to do it again. Or I'm too frightened not to be able to get it. Or perhaps I'm not trained enough - had I had a training I think you think differently. I don't think you can think like the way I'm saying, that it can only be once, if you've had a theatrical training because you know you can get it again. But my training is instinctive and it's my training, it's what I've taught myself as I've gone along as to how to get the effect that I want. CC: Do you think that's a kind of nakedness? The technique that you might have acquired if you'd gone through \"great British acting institutions\" would have created a superstructure around you, but you don't have that. CR: No. I have always avoided it, not consciously, except for The Royal Court, which I loved, and the work I did with George Devine. Improvisation work, for example, we did there, and that was wonderful for me. You just had to get up in front of the class and do things. The teacher would say make us laugh, make us cry, make us believe in this. Make us believe in a way that children do. That's very powerful and useful. But anything that's formal, any kind of formal, institutionalised training - and anything institutionalised in life - I always end up avoiding that, and doing something else. CC: Many people would treasure the film Zardoz most, what was it like working with John Boorman? CR: Who would treasure most? CC: Those who'd admired your careerwell, I think that. Alright, I'm speaking for myself CR: Is he? Is he speaking for himself? That surprises me. Zardoz? CC: You don't regard that as something special in your career? CR: I don't know what I regard as special too much, I'm not the best judge. It just made me laugh, I don't know why. It's a funny film, a mixture of all sorts of things. CC: It just goes to show that critics are always wrong. CR: I'm certainly not the one who can judge all of that. CC: It seems to me that you find a completely different style of acting. There you are, with Sean Connery in an all-muscles role, and you cease to be this strange, dark creature and it's another actress altogether. CR: Hmm. CC: No? Well, passing lightly over Orca Killer Whale, let's talk about Stardust Memories CR: Just as well I had Orca Killer Whale, otherwise not a child in the world would know who I was. They couldn't see any of my films. What could my sons see? Well, they saw Orca. And they jolly well enjoyed it, it was a lovely film. CC: Did Woody Allen casting you in Stardust Memories come out of the blue?",

      "byline": "Matt Wells  media correspondent",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>An intellectual pillow fight between Conrad Black and a clutch of distinguished writers from his prestigious publications has exploded into a titanic battle of egos. After accusing the Spectator columnist Taki Theodoracopoulos of anti-semitism for criticising Israel's role in the Middle East conflict, the press baron is in the dock himself - accused of stifling reasoned debate. </p> <p>Three prominent writers - all of them past contributors to Mr Black's Telegraph group - have signed a letter to the Spectator accusing him of abusing his responsibilities as a proprietor. Such is the vehemence with which Mr Black has expounded his pro-Israel views, they say, no editor or reporter would dare write frankly about the Palestinian perspective. </p> <p>\"Readers have been warned. There may be many good things in Black's newspapers, but for balanced reporting from the Middle East, they must now, sadly, turn elsewhere.\" </p> <p>With characteristic bombast, Black dismisses them as \"whingers and simperers\", arguing that he has just as much right as the next man to write to his own publications and insisting that his editors are free to print a range of opinions without proprietorial interference. </p> <p>Caught in the middle is the Spectator editor, Boris Johnson, fielding at once the ire of his boss and the irritation of his contributors. </p> <p>The anger of pro-Palestinian writers was provoked last November when the commentator Barbara Amiel, wife of Mr Black, wrote in a 5,300-word article in the Daily Telegraph that, despite Palestinian claims to the contrary, no serious attacks on Islamic holy sites would ever be tolerated by the Israelis. </p> <p>Taki later incensed Mr Black in a Spectator column when he said that the US had intended to force down the aeroplane of the fugitive financier Marc Rich. He said that Rich only escaped because he was tipped off by the Israeli secret service Mossad - a payback for the \"moola\" that Rich had given Israel. (In an unfortunate passage, Taki labelled himself an anti-Semite by confusing the term \"soi disant\" - thinking it meant \"so-called\" when in fact it translates as \"self-styled\".) </p> <p>For Mr Black, Taki's claims about Rich were \"lies worthy of Goebbels\". In a trenchant piece the following week, he said Taki's piece was unworthy of the Spectator and went on to lambast sections of the media- including the BBC, the Indepen dent and the Guardian - for allegedly being biased in favour of the Palestinians. </p> <p>A boisterous correspondence ensued in the letters pages of the Spectator: this week, Mr Black returned to print with another scathing attack on his critics. \"Fair comment and non-venomous ethnic reflections that might offend the politically correct are perfectly acceptable from contributors. However, our publications will not be used for incitements to racial or religious bigotry,\" he thundered. </p> <p>In the same issue, three prominent writers took issue with Mr Black's line. His original article would scare his editors from printing opposing views, argued William Dalrymple, Piers Paul Read and AN Wilson. \"It makes explicit what has long been apparent to those of us who have written about the Middle East in the Spectator: that under Black's proprietorship, serious, critical reporting of Israel is no longer tolerated in the Telegraph Group, however much Arab land Israel seizes, however many settlements it constructs in violation of international law and the Geneva conventions, however many Palestinians it expels or tortures and however many unarmed children it shoots.\" </p> <p>Mr Black dismissed the charges as \"complete nonsense\". He said: \"I'm happy to exchange fire with these people, but when I score a series of direct hits on them, I don't see why they should whinge and simper that I don't have the right to write to my own publications.\" </p> <p>He said that while he might exchange views with his editors, they were free to publish articles expressing views that opposed his own, so long as they were clearly labelled as comment. \"The allegation that I bully and intimidate our editors is nonsense,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Johnson was equally scathing, claiming that the writers wanted to withdraw their letter when it emerged that they had praised the independence of a Jerusalem-based publication without realising it was now controlled by Mr Black. \"It's all very well them casting aspersions, but if they are going to get their facts wrong, they had better get up earlier in the morning,\" he said. </p> <p>The three writers claim Mr Johnson and Mr Black colluded to retain the inaccuracy, thereby giving the proprietor more ammunition with which to attack them. Mr Johnson said: \"It must be the first time in history that people are complaining that we ran their letter.\"</p> <p><strong>Who's who in The Spectator spat</strong></p> <p><strong> Conrad Black </strong> Age 56. Canadian publisher. Chairman of Hollinger, owner of the Telegraph group. Military historian. Has passionate and strongly-held views on the Middle East conflict. Former Tory minister Lord Gilmour accused him of dispensing \"virulent Israeli propaganda\"; Black retorted that Gilmour was \"an almost pathological Americanophobic myth-maker\".</p> <p><strong> Boris Johnson </strong> Age 36. Young fogey editor of the Spectator and regular on the punditry circuit - currently seen sparring on BBC News 24 with the Guardian's Polly Toynbee. Selected as Tory candidate for Michael Heseltine's seat, Henley, for the next election. Speculation continues about whether he will continue a role at the magazine if he is elected.</p> <p><strong> AN Wilson </strong> Age 50. Full name Andrew Wilson. Former literary editor at the Spectator. Now writes column for the Evening Standard, edited by former Daily Telegraph editor Max Hastings. Revealed recently that Field Marshall Montgomery, on a visit to Rugby school, had \"allowed his fingers very delicately to stroke mine\".</p> <p><strong> Taki Theodoracopoulos </strong> Age 63. Outspoken socialite and columnist, writes column for the Spectator. Vocal supporter of General Pinochet and one-time backer of disgraced former Tory MP Neil Hamilton. Once described New York Puerto Ricans as \"fat, squat, ugly, dusky, dirty and unbelievably loud. They turned Manhattan into Palermo faster than you can say spic.\" Then, he was defended by Black.</p> <p><strong>Barbara Amiel </strong> Age 60. Wife of Mr Black and occasional Telegraph contributer. Appears to have set off the current spat with a legendary article in the Daily Telegraph last November, in which she claimed Israel would never desecrate an Islamic holy site.

      "bodyText": "An intellectual pillow fight between Conrad Black and a clutch of distinguished writers from his prestigious publications has exploded into a titanic battle of egos. After accusing the Spectator columnist Taki Theodoracopoulos of anti-semitism for criticising Israel's role in the Middle East conflict, the press baron is in the dock himself - accused of stifling reasoned debate. Three prominent writers - all of them past contributors to Mr Black's Telegraph group - have signed a letter to the Spectator accusing him of abusing his responsibilities as a proprietor. Such is the vehemence with which Mr Black has expounded his pro-Israel views, they say, no editor or reporter would dare write frankly about the Palestinian perspective. \"Readers have been warned. There may be many good things in Black's newspapers, but for balanced reporting from the Middle East, they must now, sadly, turn elsewhere.\" With characteristic bombast, Black dismisses them as \"whingers and simperers\", arguing that he has just as much right as the next man to write to his own publications and insisting that his editors are free to print a range of opinions without proprietorial interference. Caught in the middle is the Spectator editor, Boris Johnson, fielding at once the ire of his boss and the irritation of his contributors. The anger of pro-Palestinian writers was provoked last November when the commentator Barbara Amiel, wife of Mr Black, wrote in a 5,300-word article in the Daily Telegraph that, despite Palestinian claims to the contrary, no serious attacks on Islamic holy sites would ever be tolerated by the Israelis. Taki later incensed Mr Black in a Spectator column when he said that the US had intended to force down the aeroplane of the fugitive financier Marc Rich. He said that Rich only escaped because he was tipped off by the Israeli secret service Mossad - a payback for the \"moola\" that Rich had given Israel. (In an unfortunate passage, Taki labelled himself an anti-Semite by confusing the term \"soi disant\" - thinking it meant \"so-called\" when in fact it translates as \"self-styled\".) For Mr Black, Taki's claims about Rich were \"lies worthy of Goebbels\". In a trenchant piece the following week, he said Taki's piece was unworthy of the Spectator and went on to lambast sections of the media- including the BBC, the Indepen dent and the Guardian - for allegedly being biased in favour of the Palestinians. A boisterous correspondence ensued in the letters pages of the Spectator: this week, Mr Black returned to print with another scathing attack on his critics. \"Fair comment and non-venomous ethnic reflections that might offend the politically correct are perfectly acceptable from contributors. However, our publications will not be used for incitements to racial or religious bigotry,\" he thundered. In the same issue, three prominent writers took issue with Mr Black's line. His original article would scare his editors from printing opposing views, argued William Dalrymple, Piers Paul Read and AN Wilson. \"It makes explicit what has long been apparent to those of us who have written about the Middle East in the Spectator: that under Black's proprietorship, serious, critical reporting of Israel is no longer tolerated in the Telegraph Group, however much Arab land Israel seizes, however many settlements it constructs in violation of international law and the Geneva conventions, however many Palestinians it expels or tortures and however many unarmed children it shoots.\" Mr Black dismissed the charges as \"complete nonsense\". He said: \"I'm happy to exchange fire with these people, but when I score a series of direct hits on them, I don't see why they should whinge and simper that I don't have the right to write to my own publications.\" He said that while he might exchange views with his editors, they were free to publish articles expressing views that opposed his own, so long as they were clearly labelled as comment. \"The allegation that I bully and intimidate our editors is nonsense,\" he said. Mr Johnson was equally scathing, claiming that the writers wanted to withdraw their letter when it emerged that they had praised the independence of a Jerusalem-based publication without realising it was now controlled by Mr Black. \"It's all very well them casting aspersions, but if they are going to get their facts wrong, they had better get up earlier in the morning,\" he said. The three writers claim Mr Johnson and Mr Black colluded to retain the inaccuracy, thereby giving the proprietor more ammunition with which to attack them. Mr Johnson said: \"It must be the first time in history that people are complaining that we ran their letter.\" Who's who in The Spectator spat Conrad Black Age 56. Canadian publisher. Chairman of Hollinger, owner of the Telegraph group. Military historian. Has passionate and strongly-held views on the Middle East conflict. Former Tory minister Lord Gilmour accused him of dispensing \"virulent Israeli propaganda\"; Black retorted that Gilmour was \"an almost pathological Americanophobic myth-maker\". Boris Johnson Age 36. Young fogey editor of the Spectator and regular on the punditry circuit - currently seen sparring on BBC News 24 with the Guardian's Polly Toynbee. Selected as Tory candidate for Michael Heseltine's seat, Henley, for the next election. Speculation continues about whether he will continue a role at the magazine if he is elected. AN Wilson Age 50. Full name Andrew Wilson. Former literary editor at the Spectator. Now writes column for the Evening Standard, edited by former Daily Telegraph editor Max Hastings. Revealed recently that Field Marshall Montgomery, on a visit to Rugby school, had \"allowed his fingers very delicately to stroke mine\". Taki Theodoracopoulos Age 63. Outspoken socialite and columnist, writes column for the Spectator. Vocal supporter of General Pinochet and one-time backer of disgraced former Tory MP Neil Hamilton. Once described New York Puerto Ricans as \"fat, squat, ugly, dusky, dirty and unbelievably loud. They turned Manhattan into Palermo faster than you can say spic.\" Then, he was defended by Black. Barbara Amiel Age 60. Wife of Mr Black and occasional Telegraph contributer. Appears to have set off the current spat with a legendary article in the Daily Telegraph last November, in which she claimed Israel would never desecrate an Islamic holy site. Described by a former editor of the Tatler, Lucy Yeomans, as a woman who can\"sit in the front row of the couture and then whip up 5,000 words on the Middle East crisis\". William Dalrymple Age 35. Travel writer and author. Has had run-ins with Black over the Middle East question before: Black claims Dalrymple was dropped as a Telegraph contributor after \"inventing\" a story of Israeli desecration of Christian sites in Palestine; Dalrymple says his claims, in the award-winning book From the Holy Mountain, have never seriously been challenged.",

      "body": "<p><strong>SPURS SHOCK SACKING SUPER SPECIAL! </strong></p> <p>If you thought that Spurs executive vice-chairman David Buchler was angry yesterday when he was firing salvos at well-known buck-toothed train franchise owners, you ain't seen nothin' yet. This afternoon, the perpetually cross ENIC executive summoned manager George Graham to his parlour and demanded to know why details of a \"private meeting\" were splattered all over the papers. Nanoseconds later, he sacked him.</p> <p>[pause while 86% of White Hart Lane faithful cheer wildly and race off to pub]</p> <p>\"I had a private meeting with George Graham and David Pleat this week and then found this morning details of it plastered across the press,\" Buchler explained, referring to an interview Graham gave telling fans not to expect any \"big outlays\" on new players. \"I called George in for an explanation today. However, no explanation was forthcoming and he had a defiant attitude,\" the Spurs exec seethed, simmered, salivated and stewed.</p> <p>\"I am building from top to bottom a cohesive team, and this is a difficult time for the club, with a semi-final coming up and negotiations with players over contracts,\" babbled the bubbling board member. \"We agreed we cannot work with each other. I am not prepared to have someone who is not a team player and who is not looking after the club's interests,\" he put the boot in, before installing David Pleat as caretaker manager.</p> <p>But who will take over full time? Well, there's Southampton boss Glenn Hoddle, of course, although they'll want to get their FA Cup run out of the way first, as Hod is plainly a managerial liability in that particular tournament. Another former player, Gary Mabbutt, has been mentioned in dispatches, seemingly on the grounds that he's a bit of a nice bloke. And, of course, there's Terry Venables. The Middlesbrough supremo may have had enough of picking Bryan Robson up when he needs burping, and with nemesis Alan Sugar out of the way, he'd be free to return.</p> <p>Inevitably, other names will enter the frame as well, so if you've heard any wild rumours - or perhaps made one up yourself - send them to the.boss@theguardian.com. And if Spurs haven't cleared this mess up over the weekend, we may be able to get some mileage out of them next week.</p> <p><strong>TOUGH DRAW FOR UNITED (BUT EUROPE ISN'T JUST ABOUT LEEDS, YOU KNOW) </strong></p> <p>ITV commentator Clive Tyldesley finds it impossible to string more than a few words together without mentioning Manchester United's 1999 Big Cup victory over Bayern Munich. The other night, barely seven minutes of a game involving Arsenal had elapsed before he was waxing lyrical about Ole Gunnar Solksjaer's late Nou Camp contribution. This, to be fair, was his most restrained effort for some time, but as the Fiver doubts whether the man can order a cup of tea in the staff canteen without mentioning a Teddy Sheringham near-post flick, we're sure this morning's draw for the Big Cup quarter-finals has blown his sense of perspective to pieces once and for all.</p> <p>Yes, the most hated team in England have drawn the most hated team in Germany in Big Cup. \"Bayern will be looking for revenge but obviously we've got great memories of that night,\" United secretary Ken Merrett said as the Old Trafford PR machine wheeled the big guns out. \"We see them as the toughest opponent in the draw,\" uberface of Bayern, Franz Beckenbauer, smarmed in unison. Sadly, the romantic trills of the United-Bayern love-in were soon drowned out by raucous laughter across Europe, when it was realised that the winners of this tie will probably be knocked out in the semis: they'll face either Real Madrid or Galatasaray (ie Real Madrid).</p> <p>Meanwhile, the other half of the draw looks a bit healthier for the two teams Clive barely mentions on ITV's superb and in no way base Big Cup coverage. Leeds will play Deportivo, while Arsenal will struggle against Valencia, and it wasn't long before big nobs from both teams were wheeling out meaningless soundbites. \"We've just got to win!\" said Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein, while shy Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale mumbled, \"It doesn't matter who we got!\" And if both English teams win their ties - first leg April 3/4, second leg April 17/18 - they'll face each other in the semis. That should be enough to grab Clive's attention. Won't it?</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"It's another challenge. It's not a challenge that I would have liked - I'd rather have had the challenge of getting into Europe - but it's another challenge and it's a challenge that I relish. It's a challenge and I'm up for that challenge\" - Middlesbrough midfielder Paul Ince on the challenge of the relegation challenge.</p> <p><strong>NOT BIG CUP</strong></p> <p>It may be the competition nobody takes seriously, but there are advantages to playing in Euro Vase, you know. Unlike the teams playing with the Big Cup big boys, you get a whole section in the Fiver to yourself for a start. Actually, that's about it, to tell the truth. But plucky little Alaves, who will play Kaiserslautern in the semi-finals to be held on April 5 and April 19, aren't going to turn down some much-needed exposure, are they?</p> <p>Liverpool, meanwhile, have drawn Barcelona in the other semi. So that's that, then. \"It would be a great final but you've got to play the best teams sooner or later and in many ways I think we would rather have them over the two legs,\" grimaced Anfield money-man Rick Parry. \"And we also have the opportunity of that visit to the Nou Camp,\" he bravely chirped, desperately grabbing at the few straws poking out of the pile of rubble that represents his club's hopes and dreams.</p> <p>At least one man is happy to be facing Barcelona's multitude of famous names including Rivaldo, Patrick Kluivert and, erm, um, that Dutch bloke who has a brother. \"I am sure this is the tie every Liverpool fan wanted,\" smiled tricky winger and hopeless crosser Vladimir Smicer. \"After all, Barcelona is a great city and I know that I am not the only person on Merseyside who wants to experience their magnificent stadium. It has always been my dream to play in the Nou Camp stadium and this gives me the opportunity to do that.\" Hmm, close your eyes and that could almost be Jari Litmanen talking, couldn't it?</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Coventry, Derby and Wimbledon are all chasing 24-year-old Mechelen striker Joris van Hout.</p> <p>Huddersfield are interested in Southampton midfielder Chris Marsden.</p> <p><strong>NEWS IN BRIEF</strong></p> <p>Middlesbrough today confirmed that Dean Windass' move to the Riverside from Bradford has been completed. The deal, which could eventually be worth up to \u00a31m, was sealed ahead of the noon deadline which means he is available for selection for tomorrow's derby clash with Newcastle. No details of the agreement have been revealed after a week of renegotiations, during which it emerged the original plan - \u00a3600,000 down with \u00a3400,000 to come if Boro avoid relegation - was extremely unlikely to be approved.</p> <p>England Under-21 coach Howard Wilkinson has included Newcastle striker Shola Ameobi in his squad for next Friday's European Championship qualifier with Finland at Oakwell. Wilkinson is keen for the 19-year-old Ameobi to pledge his international future to England after news that Nigeria are keen on securing his services.</p> <p>Wycombe manager Lawrie Sanchez has been charged with misconduct by the FA. Sanchez allegedly used abusive behaviour towards a match official during the second half of last weekend's FA Cup quarter-final win over Leicester at Filbert Street.</p> <p>Tony Cottee has left his post of player-manager at Barnet after just four months in charge. He said: \"This has been a fantastic learning curve for me and my experience with Barnet will stand me in good stead for the future. With the current precarious situation, the chairman and I agree that it is best that the team is placed in the hands of a man with more experience in Third Division football.\" John Still, who was installed as director of football following Cottee's appointment, will resume his former role of manager for the remainder of the season.</p> <p>Confusion surrounds former Liverpool manager Roy Evans' plans to join Stockport County. The Hatters released a statement this morning saying Evans, who has been out of football since leaving Anfield in 1998, would be linking up with manager Andy Kilner on Monday to act as an advisor. But now BBC reports suggest Evans has turned down the invitation, saying that he does not want to interfere with Kilner's position.</p> <p><strong>TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO</strong></p> <p>ITV: World Football (2.25am) </p> <p>\"I work in the programme development department of a small-to-middling independent television production company,\" writes Lucas.</p> <p>Sky Sports 2: Futbol Mundial (5.30pm) </p> <p>\"We make several light-entertainment reality shows [remember Jailbreak?] for Channel 5, and last January I was responsible for trying to purchase the rights to the original US version of Touch the Truck.\"</p> <p>Sky Sports 3: Sports Centre Football Hour (10pm, 1.30am SS2) </p> <p>\"Instead of securing a money-spinning deal, I spent my time reading the Fiver and missed out on this golden opportunity.

[pause while 86% of White Hart Lane faithful cheer wildly and race off to pub] \"I had a private meeting with George Graham and David Pleat this week and then found this morning details of it plastered across the press,\" Buchler explained, referring to an interview Graham gave telling fans not to expect any \"big outlays\" on new players. \"I called George in for an explanation today. However, no explanation was forthcoming and he had a defiant attitude,\" the Spurs exec seethed, simmered, salivated and stewed. \"I am building from top to bottom a cohesive team, and this is a difficult time for the club, with a semi-final coming up and negotiations with players over contracts,\" babbled the bubbling board member. \"We agreed we cannot work with each other. I am not prepared to have someone who is not a team player and who is not looking after the club's interests,\" he put the boot in, before installing David Pleat as caretaker manager. But who will take over full time? Well, there's Southampton boss Glenn Hoddle, of course, although they'll want to get their FA Cup run out of the way first, as Hod is plainly a managerial liability in that particular tournament. Another former player, Gary Mabbutt, has been mentioned in dispatches, seemingly on the grounds that he's a bit of a nice bloke. And, of course, there's Terry Venables. The Middlesbrough supremo may have had enough of picking Bryan Robson up when he needs burping, and with nemesis Alan Sugar out of the way, he'd be free to return. Inevitably, other names will enter the frame as well, so if you've heard any wild rumours - or perhaps made one up yourself - send them to the.boss@theguardian.com. And if Spurs haven't cleared this mess up over the weekend, we may be able to get some mileage out of them next week. TOUGH DRAW FOR UNITED (BUT EUROPE ISN'T JUST ABOUT LEEDS, YOU KNOW) ITV commentator Clive Tyldesley finds it impossible to string more than a few words together without mentioning Manchester United's 1999 Big Cup victory over Bayern Munich. The other night, barely seven minutes of a game involving Arsenal had elapsed before he was waxing lyrical about Ole Gunnar Solksjaer's late Nou Camp contribution. This, to be fair, was his most restrained effort for some time, but as the Fiver doubts whether the man can order a cup of tea in the staff canteen without mentioning a Teddy Sheringham near-post flick, we're sure this morning's draw for the Big Cup quarter-finals has blown his sense of perspective to pieces once and for all. Yes, the most hated team in England have drawn the most hated team in Germany in Big Cup. \"Bayern will be looking for revenge but obviously we've got great memories of that night,\" United secretary Ken Merrett said as the Old Trafford PR machine wheeled the big guns out. \"We see them as the toughest opponent in the draw,\" uberface of Bayern, Franz Beckenbauer, smarmed in unison. Sadly, the romantic trills of the United-Bayern love-in were soon drowned out by raucous laughter across Europe, when it was realised that the winners of this tie will probably be knocked out in the semis: they'll face either Real Madrid or Galatasaray (ie Real Madrid). Meanwhile, the other half of the draw looks a bit healthier for the two teams Clive barely mentions on ITV's superb and in no way base Big Cup coverage. Leeds will play Deportivo, while Arsenal will struggle against Valencia, and it wasn't long before big nobs from both teams were wheeling out meaningless soundbites. \"We've just got to win!\" said Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein, while shy Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale mumbled, \"It doesn't matter who we got!\" And if both English teams win their ties - first leg April 3/4, second leg April 17/18 - they'll face each other in the semis. That should be enough to grab Clive's attention. Won't it? QUOTE OF THE DAY \"It's another challenge. It's not a challenge that I would have liked - I'd rather have had the challenge of getting into Europe - but it's another challenge and it's a challenge that I relish. It's a challenge and I'm up for that challenge\" - Middlesbrough midfielder Paul Ince on the challenge of the relegation challenge. NOT BIG CUP It may be the competition nobody takes seriously, but there are advantages to playing in Euro Vase, you know. Unlike the teams playing with the Big Cup big boys, you get a whole section in the Fiver to yourself for a start. Actually, that's about it, to tell the truth. But plucky little Alaves, who will play Kaiserslautern in the semi-finals to be held on April 5 and April 19, aren't going to turn down some much-needed exposure, are they? Liverpool, meanwhile, have drawn Barcelona in the other semi. So that's that, then. \"It would be a great final but you've got to play the best teams sooner or later and in many ways I think we would rather have them over the two legs,\" grimaced Anfield money-man Rick Parry. \"And we also have the opportunity of that visit to the Nou Camp,\" he bravely chirped, desperately grabbing at the few straws poking out of the pile of rubble that represents his club's hopes and dreams. At least one man is happy to be facing Barcelona's multitude of famous names including Rivaldo, Patrick Kluivert and, erm, um, that Dutch bloke who has a brother. \"I am sure this is the tie every Liverpool fan wanted,\" smiled tricky winger and hopeless crosser Vladimir Smicer. \"After all, Barcelona is a great city and I know that I am not the only person on Merseyside who wants to experience their magnificent stadium. It has always been my dream to play in the Nou Camp stadium and this gives me the opportunity to do that.\" Hmm, close your eyes and that could almost be Jari Litmanen talking, couldn't it? THE RUMOUR MILL Coventry, Derby and Wimbledon are all chasing 24-year-old Mechelen striker Joris van Hout. Huddersfield are interested in Southampton midfielder Chris Marsden. NEWS IN BRIEF Middlesbrough today confirmed that Dean Windass' move to the Riverside from Bradford has been completed. The deal, which could eventually be worth up to \u00a31m, was sealed ahead of the noon deadline which means he is available for selection for tomorrow's derby clash with Newcastle. No details of the agreement have been revealed after a week of renegotiations, during which it emerged the original plan - \u00a3600,000 down with \u00a3400,000 to come if Boro avoid relegation - was extremely unlikely to be approved. England Under-21 coach Howard Wilkinson has included Newcastle striker Shola Ameobi in his squad for next Friday's European Championship qualifier with Finland at Oakwell. Wilkinson is keen for the 19-year-old Ameobi to pledge his international future to England after news that Nigeria are keen on securing his services. Wycombe manager Lawrie Sanchez has been charged with misconduct by the FA. Sanchez allegedly used abusive behaviour towards a match official during the second half of last weekend's FA Cup quarter-final win over Leicester at Filbert Street. Tony Cottee has left his post of player-manager at Barnet after just four months in charge. He said: \"This has been a fantastic learning curve for me and my experience with Barnet will stand me in good stead for the future. With the current precarious situation, the chairman and I agree that it is best that the team is placed in the hands of a man with more experience in Third Division football.\" John Still, who was installed as director of football following Cottee's appointment, will resume his former role of manager for the remainder of the season. Confusion surrounds former Liverpool manager Roy Evans' plans to join Stockport County. The Hatters released a statement this morning saying Evans, who has been out of football since leaving Anfield in 1998, would be linking up with manager Andy Kilner on Monday to act as an advisor. But now BBC reports suggest Evans has turned down the invitation, saying that he does not want to interfere with Kilner's position. TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO ITV: World Football (2.25am) \"I work in the programme development department of a small-to-middling independent television production company,\" writes Lucas. Sky Sports 2: Futbol Mundial (5.30pm) \"We make several light-entertainment reality shows [remember Jailbreak?] for Channel 5, and last January I was responsible for trying to purchase the rights to the original US version of Touch the Truck.\" Sky Sports 3: Sports Centre Football Hour (10pm, 1.30am SS2) \"Instead of securing a money-spinning deal, I spent my time reading the Fiver and missed out on this golden opportunity.

He is no straight-arrow hero figure, but a flawed and self-doubting character which, like Russell Crowe's whistleblower in The Insider, makes him an unusually lifelike kind of hero: this, you feel, is the best you might do in an awful situation, muddling through and getting it right some of the time.

Nope, the real clue was tucked away on the B-side of last year's limited-edition, back-to-basics, number one single Masses Against the Classes, where James Dean Bradfield, Nicky Wire and Sean Moore treated the fans to an exuberant cover of Chuck Berry's Rock and Roll Music. It was an enthusiastically pointless pub-rock joy, and sounded like a band desperately trying to shake off their increasingly humourless, flabby-arsed, Brit-friendly AOR, even if it meant being retro and corny. And so it proves from the outset of Know Your Enemy, as Bradfield recklessly unleashes a bunch of old Johnny Thunders geetar licks on Found that Soul, followed by Ocean Spray, a clean, sweet, acoustic stroll reminiscing on the death of Bradfield's mother. Those who only check in for the band's post-Richey angst-with-orchestras might like to leave about now. </p> <p>Because Know Your Enemy, produced with an ear for invention, spontaneity and grungy din by Dave Eringa, Mike Hedges and David Holmes, is all over the place and so blatantly derivative of so many bands that it occasionally resembles one of those old Top of the Pops compilations. Indeed, the album features your fave Welsh rockers performing in the style of the Beach Boys (So Why So Sad), Sonic Youth (Intravenous Agnostic), Joy Division (Dead Martyrs), New Order (Baby Elian), Jesus and Mary Chain (the coda of My Guernica) and, on The Year of Purification and His Last Painting, good old REM - which might surprise those who remember Wire's \"I hope Michael Stipe gets Aids\" pronouncement onstage at the Kilburn National a few years ago. Unoriginal? Well, yes. But it does make Know Your Enemy more fun to listen to than anything since their Generation Terrorists debut. </p> <p>This scattershot approach has its shortcomings, though. Wattsville Blues features Wire's first lead vocals on a Manics LP. Pitched entirely on one note, he manages to make Mark E Smith sound like Mariah Carey. This lurching, sweary, sneery thing tries, and fails, to be very New York, 1976. Which, in a very different way, is what the next track would like to sound like too. Miss Europa Disco Dancer is their much-discussed first stab at disco, featuring Wire and drummer Moore struggling miserably to master the rudiments of a basic disco beat. By the time Wire starts chanting \"Braindead motherfuckers\" repeatedly to fade, your smile has congealed into an embarrassed wince. </p> <p>Of course, their being the Manics, it's not all Studio 54 and glittery slingbacks. The preacher part of the name is more appropriate here than at any time since the early days. Sadly, Wire continues to be lousy at it. The Small Faces-esque Let Robeson Sing pays tribute to the great Afro-American baritone and left-wing activist Paul Robeson, with Wire (via Bradfield's tonsils) asking: \"Can anyone make a difference any more?/ Can anyone write a protest song?\" Well, yes, probably. Tell you what - why don't you get on and give it a try? What is this, Who Wants To Be a Guilt-Ridden Millionaire? Elsewhere, and in keeping with the central theme of \"America - Crap or What?\", Baby Elian bigs up Cuba and informs us that \"You don't sit in a rocking chair/ When you build a revolution\" - which perhaps explains why Val Doonican never worked with Public Enemy. </p> <p>So ignore the words, because My Guernica, His Last Painting and The Convalescent are magnificently dark, marching and charging post-punk anthems. Freedom of Speech Won't Feed My Children, apart from possessing the definitive Manics song title, is swaggering, driving drone-rock that sums up everything great about this band. Furious, unreasonable (the Dalai Lama and the US celebs who support him come in for serious stick), confusing (freedom of speech \"just brings heart disease\", apparently) and cantankerously dumb, it reminds you that the Manics are, essentially, all the misguided and muddled bits of the Clash without a London Calling or White Riot to make it all right. Which, in a world of Coldplays and David Grays, remains surprisingly lovable. </p> <p>Nevertheless, this record is the most directionless and baffling Manics album thus far. It's tempting to conclude that its true nature will only be revealed in the fullness of time. But I suspect that Know Your Enemy will remain what it is - a well-meaning and charismatic mess, much like the band who made it.</p>",

So ignore the words, because My Guernica, His Last Painting and The Convalescent are magnificently dark, marching and charging post-punk anthems. Freedom of Speech Won't Feed My Children, apart from possessing the definitive Manics song title, is swaggering, driving drone-rock that sums up everything great about this band. Furious, unreasonable (the Dalai Lama and the US celebs who support him come in for serious stick), confusing (freedom of speech \"just brings heart disease\", apparently) and cantankerously dumb, it reminds you that the Manics are, essentially, all the misguided and muddled bits of the Clash without a London Calling or White Riot to make it all right. Which, in a world of Coldplays and David Grays, remains surprisingly lovable. Nevertheless, this record is the most directionless and baffling Manics album thus far. It's tempting to conclude that its true nature will only be revealed in the fullness of time. But I suspect that Know Your Enemy will remain what it is - a well-meaning and charismatic mess, much like the band who made it.",

His most accessible track, Song to the Siren, the narcotic generation's Unchained Melody, was resurrected by This Mortal Coil; while the success of his son Jeff, who made similarly complex, jazz-inflected music, excited further interest in the father. His original albums veer wildly in quality, but this 34-track retrospective is a judiciously selected pr\u00e9cis, featuring six tracks from the inspired and beautiful Goodbye &amp; Hello and just one from the unfocused Look at the Fool. Buckley avoided taut verses and whistlable choruses; not, as the pretty It Happens Every Time confirms, because he couldn't master them, but because he had other goals. Phantasmagoria In Two is more typical: tearfully sung, structurally haphazard, but possessed of emotive dignity. For the uninitiated, this is the place to discover Tim Buckley. (JA) </p> <p><strong> Kristin Hersh </strong> Sunny Border Blue <br>(4AD) <br> **** <br> \u00a312.99<br></p> <p> Pop music tends to recoil in embarrassed horror when confronted by genuine mental illness. With commendable bravery, however, American singer-songwriter Kristin Hersh has spoken candidly about her bipolar disorder: in medical terms, a sibling of cyclothymia; in lay terms, manic depression. It has long been her contention that her condition makes her a conduit for, rather than a pro-active participant in, the dark songs that hurtle out of her. Sunny Border Blue takes time to settle, but the songs are a hive of activity that yield more charms with each play. Hersh drums, fiercely strums guitars, tootles on brass and, especially on Ruby, wafts over some divine backing vocals. And when she starts to sing, potential chaff becomes wheat. She delivers all these songs in emotional extremis, her voice cracking during Tearful on Trouble, then vulnerably sneering on White Suckers. She is utterly convincing: that, allied to her keening intelligence, is why she is special. Her lyrics pick over emotional debris, from marital discord to self-awareness and self-delusion (\"It's not my fault you don't love me when I'm drunk\" on Your Dirty Answer). The album is not for the faint of heart, but its effect becomes increasingly uplifting the more familiar songs such as 37 Hours and the sprightly Flipside become. (JA) <strong> Radio Tarifa</strong> Cruzando El Rio <br>(World Circuit)<br> **<br> \u00a313.99<br> </p> <p> The Spanish band Radio Tarifa have specialised in mixing Arabic influences with flamenco and medieval Spanish styles. Performing live with their stirring flamenco dancer, they are one of the most exhilarating world-music bands in Europe, but here they sound decidedly less adventurous. Band leader Fain S Duenas has mysteriously decided to add electric guitar (played by himself) to his band's eclectic instrumental mix, and the opening piece sounds like an awkward mix of flamenco and Moroccan styles with an odd Caribbean edge. Other tracks range from an unremarkable percussive work-out to some gentle, delicate songs that blend African and medieval influences. But they lack the exuberance of either the best North African pop or flamenco, and many are just fragments: pleasant enough, but a bit thin. (RD) </p> <p><strong> Terris </strong> Learning To Let Go<br> (WEA) <br> *** <br> \u00a39.99<br> </p> <p> Prematurely touted as best new band at last year's NME awards, Terris took the next 12 months off to get over the shock of their elevation from morose Welsh garage band to Radioheads-in-waiting. Their first album finally arrives to a distinct sense of anticlimax. Their thunder has been stolen by the return of the real Radiohead and the repunked Manic Street Preachers, who make Terris's guitar/drums rawness feel redundant. What they do have going for them is Gavin Goodwin, a peroxided torrent of rage who hates most things with a passion and does so in tune. He rasps the embittered sentiments of Shapeshifter and Beneath the Belt (\"I'm gonna get over you, I've learned to deal with you\") as if choking on his own bile. But deeply felt as it clearly is, the incessant clawing at his wounds is hard to sustain, and harder to listen to. (CS) </p> <p><strong> Aerosmith </strong> Just Push Play<br> (Columbia) <br> *** <br> \u00a315.99<br></p> <p> Strange to remember that Aerosmith (well, singer Steve Tyler and guitarist Joe Perry) were the first rockers to bridge the rock-rap divide when they teamed up with Run-DMC in 1986 on Walk This Way. That aberration aside, Boston's finest have spent their 30-year career heeding the maxim \"If it ain't broke . . . \" It could be time for a rethink. With the formerly wild-living Tyler and Perry now apparently clean and serene, they're no longer the band they were. Calling their first album in four years Just Push Play might be a sly dig at their own entrenched ways, although considering that the thundering title track is about deflowering virgins, it's probably not. Then again, on the titanic weepie Fly Away From Here, Tyler busts a gut exploring the subject of changing and moving on. Confused? They certainly are. But they sustain the energy to the last gasp of Face - spurred on, no doubt, by fantasies of girls in a school gym locker. (CS)</p>",

Not, at any rate, to the same degree as most people in his position. The endless touring - this month, for example, he is to be found in Australia - can be seen as an expression of his abiding belief that music is best performed in front of an audience and has its real existence in the moment of creation. It is understood that studio recordings of his songs are early snapshots, which partially explains why his subsequent live reworkings are often so radically different. It seems curious, then, that with the exception of the 1966 Manchester Free Trade Hall concert, released a couple of years ago, his live albums have only sporadically captured Dylan's magic. This latest effort is no exception. </p> <p>You might have thought that the imminence of his 60th birthday - on May 24 - would have provided the opportunity for a celebratory release commensurate in scale with the artist's standing. Instead, we get a \"limited edition\" Japanese import, subtitled \"Thirty-nine years of great concert performances\", which sounds promising until you notice that only six of the 16 tracks have never been released before, while five are permanently available in Dylan's back catalogue. This lazy piece of work will cost you around \u00a320. </p> <p>The \"new\" items are a 1961 version of the gospel song Wade in the Water, from the much-bootlegged Minneapolis hotel tape; a fine Handsome Molly from the Gaslight Caf\u00e9 in Greenwich Village the following year, also familiar from unofficial issues; a poised To Ramona from Sheffield City Hall in 1965 (the concert captured in D A Pennebaker's Don't Look Back); and three enjoyable but hardly revelatory performances - Somebody Touched Me, Country Pie and Things Have Changed - from a concert at Portsmouth Guildhall six months ago. </p> <p>The appearance of the five already available tracks (including I Don't Believe You from Manchester '66, Knockin' on Heaven's Door from 1974's Before the Flood, and Dignity from 1994's MTV Unplugged) is inexplicable. Why not something from the 1966 Liverpool or Albert Hallconcerts, which were also recorded? More acceptable are a rollicking Grand Coulee Dam, from a 1968 Woody Guthrie memorial concert with the Band, and a nimble-fingered It Ain't Me, Babe from Renaldo and Clara, with the Rolling Thunder combo, briefly circulated on a promo disc 25 years ago. </p> <p>The remainder of the CD consists of Dead Man, Dead Man from New Orleans in 1981 (once the B-side of a cassette single), and two tracks issued on EPs, Cold Irons Bound from Los Angeles in 1997 and Born in Time from New Jersey in 1998. Each is decent but not half as good, for example, as the version of Boots of Spanish Leather of similar vintage, released on a Japanese EP. </p> <p>Goodness knows what this weird cross-section is supposed to demonstrate. If it is intended simply as an entertaining potpourri, then the selection of material is desperately unimaginative, and a step back from the intelligence on display in the archly titled Bootleg Series, which Sony began to release, somewhat haltingly, in the mid-1990s. </p> <p>It would be perfection, of course, to have Dylan's complete works, released and previously unreleased, studio and live, in a sort of Pl\u00e9iade edition, with exhaustive annotation.

Some might want a heavier, fruitier tone - Lafont is very much a baritone rather than a bass-baritone - and he does not always dominate proceedings as dramatically perhaps he should, but all the humanity is there, as well as enough of the swagger. Similarly, the Ford of Anthony Michaels-Moore lacks the steely edge that his outburst of jealousy in the second act really needs, though everywhere else he fits perfectly into the ensembles. Hillevi Martinpelto is an Alice Ford with a ravishing sense of line and perfectly focused tone, while Sara Mingardo is a Mistress Quickly of elegance and sly wit. Rebecca Evans is the Nannetta, rapturous in her duets with the Fenton of Antonella Palombi. Like everyone in this exceptional achievement, they know exactly how their characters should fit into this inexhaustibly rich musical tapestry.",

Easily the best yet to appear, it demonstrates that the concerto, far from being the grey and featureless essay in neoclassical serialism that its detractors have often claimed, is actually a work of tremendous rhythmic and textural variety, passionately argued. Mitsuko Uchida and Pierre Boulez make a wonderfully complementary partnership: her playing is by turns intensely febrile and delicately introspective; his conducting relishes every colour and nuance in the orchestral score. Together they shape the four-movements-in-one structure with total conviction. If that were not enough, Uchida's performances of two of Schoenberg's sets of piano pieces, together with Webern's Variations and Berg's single-movement Sonata, are a model of clarity, control and spontaneous fantasy. An outstanding disc. </p> <p><strong> Brahms: Piano Sonata Op 5; Ballades Op 10</strong><br> Lars Vogt<br> (EMI) <br> **** <br> \u00a314.99<br> </p> <p> There is a great deal to admire in the 30-year-old Vogt's playing of a composer who suits his temperament perfectly. He has the measure of the sweeping drama in the first movement of the F minor Sonata, yet balances its tragic intensity with moments of genuine delicacy. It is clear from the start that this is much more than wham-bam Brahms, as his careful voicing of the slow movement and punctilious articulation of the rhythms in the scherzo confirm. Each of the four Ballades has the same sense of proportion: Vogt is well aware of their programmatic origins, yet presents all the incidental details just as deftly as he apprehends the larger issues. Very classy piano playing altogether. </p> <p><strong> Shostakovich: Symphonies Nos 2 &amp; 3; Suite - The Bolt </strong><br> Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra and Chorus/Jarvi<br>(Deutsche Grammophon)<br> *** <br> \u00a314.99<br> </p> <p> The least well-known and the most problematic of all Shostakovich's symphonies (the composer as good as disowned them later in his life) make an obvious coupling. They were written in 1927 and 1929 - the Second to mark the 10th anniversary of the October Revolution, the Third to celebrate May Day - and are the most extreme examples of Shostakovich's agit-prop style. Each begins with a display of modernist gestures, with a bit of everything from neoclassicism to expressionism, and ends with a hymn to Soviet progress. Neeme Jarvi and the excellent Gothenburg forces realise the effects well enough, though they never quite screw up the tension as tightly as they could. The coupling is the suite from equally bombastic ballet The Bolt, withdrawn after one performance in 1931; by then the political tide had turned, and Shostakovich realised very quickly that he had to reorientate his style to survive. </p> <p><strong> Schmidt: The Book with Seven Seals </strong> <br>Streit/Roschmann/Lipovsek/Lippert/Hawlata/Vienna Singverein/Vienna Philharmonic/Harnoncourt <br>(Teldec, 2 CDs) <br> ***** <br> \u00a328.99<br> </p> <p> Nikolaus Harnoncourt's onward march through the Austro-German tradition began in the baroque and has now reached the 20th century. The majestic world of Franz Schmidt's apocalyptic masterpiece is a natural progression from Bruckner, whom Harnoncourt now conducts regularly with passionate conviction. This is the second outstanding set of The Book with Seven Seals to appear in recent years, and it would be hard to choose between this live account, by turns blazingly theatrical and exquisitely intimate, and the studio version by Franz Welser-Most on EMI. If Harnoncourt just wins out, it is because he is willing to take more risks, to go for extremes rather than adopt a pragmatic middle way, and all his gambles pay off. He also has the bonus of the Vienna Philharmonic on top form, a distinguished line-up of soloists, and a recording with a tingling sense of immediacy.</p>",

Catholic-educated, he admits to being culturally backward: \"I saw my first ballet in Bratislava when I was 46 years old.\" But he challenges anyone to dispute his adherence to the Labour ideals, imbibed since he decided to become a Labour MP at the age of 12. In pursuit of that goal he fought hopeless seats such as Surbiton, Croydon Central and Peterborough. After defeating the extreme rightwinger Tim Janman in 1992, he made his name as an assiduous MP and tough inquisitor of John Major. But it has been his behaviour under Tony Blair since 1997 which has marked him out from the Blairite sycophants and the usual \"awkward squad\" of leftwing rebels. In June 1998 he was widely applauded when he told the prime minister to stop scaring off his MPs from their duty to hold the government to account by encouraging \"fawning, obsequious\" and \"softball\" questions just as the Tories had done. He asked equally legitimate hardball questions of Labour ministers Robin Cook and Tony Lloyd as a member of the foreign affairs select committee, to the dismay of the whips. On the committee he has shown his commonsense shrewdness, without either subservience or disloyalty. He helped his reputation, too, with a longstanding crusade to secure belated pardons for first world war soldiers, shot for cowardice when most were suffering from shellshock and other mental breakdowns due to the horrors of trench warfare. In November 1998 he was also the first MP to introduce a freedom of information bill into the House of Commons, under the 10-minute rule. Without being disloyal to his party, he has sought to diminish the power of its whips and the power of its government, while strengthening the power of parliament.

Positioned left and right in the mix, Guy Klucevsek and Alan Bern generate dense harmonies, jazzy rhythms, atmospheric soundscapes and long, graceful melodies with the aplomb of magicians pulling silk scarves, rabbits and unicorns out of a battered old hat. </p> <p>Klucevsek is something of a new-music hero, moving and squeezing between the worlds of jazz and contemporary music with ease. He was the pivotal player in Bill Frisell's Have a Little Faith (Nonesuch). On that album, he added an orchestral element that enabled the guitarist's quintet to tackle Charles Ives, Aaron Copland and John Philip Sousa with a fresh ear and sound palette, kicking off with an ambitious version of Copland's Billy the Kid. A few years later, trumpeter Dave Douglas built his Charms of the Night Sky band (with violin and bass) around Klucevsek's accordion. Douglas is a hyperactive performer/ composer, but no one who caught his UK tour last September could fail to have been impressed by Klucevsek's cool strength in the eye of the hurricane. </p> <p>Accordance is made up of original compositions by both performers that range from the wilfully lightweight (Happy), through the finger-twistingly virtuosic (Scarlatti Fever), to more angst-ridden, post-minimalist tango workouts (Astor Place). Bern is a good composer, with pieces such as the moving, nine-minute Starting Over and the sure-footed Angel Blue. He also throws in a bit of fortepiano and melodica as sonic seasoning. They include a duo version of a jazzy Klucevsek suite featured on Douglas's first Charms of the Night Sky album (also on Winter &amp; Winter). Mug Shots is a fleet-footed, dancing trio of pieces, evoking polkas (Klucevsek comes from a Slovenian-American background) and plaintive refrains shot through with melancholy. </p> <p>Randy Newman chose his words carefully at the end of his song Love Story, anticipating a modest wedding banquet, accompanied by \"a violin, an accordion, and a tenor who can sing\". There is something sad and mysterious about these instruments, whether they are playing long, swollen chords (Pauline Oliveros-style) for Bern's composition Hegel's Fantasy, or negotiating the tricky articulations of Klucevsek's opening song Life, Liberty And the Prosciutto Happiness. Accordion players can be the life and soul of the party, but they have to keep playing. However nimble or wildly chromatic, the accordion can never be as sexy or as selfish as a lead guitar or sax, and therein lies its appeal. </p> <p><strong> Peter Blegvad </strong> Choices Under Pressure: An Acoustic Retrospective<br> (Resurgence) <br> ****<br> The Book of Leviathan <br>(Sort of Books, \u00a312.99) <br> ***** <br> </p> <p> \"That's my daughter in the water, everything she knows I taught her,\" sings Peter Blegvad at the close of his song Daughter. Bass, drums, guitar and a little splash cymbal hustle along behind in neat folk-rock style while the composer wails his sentimental but affecting words over the top. We could be in the LA Troubadour, or the one in the Old Brompton Road, listening to the man deliver well-crafted balladry such as the songs Gold or Waste of Time, in a Dylanesque drawl. Sometimes the surprise in Blegvad's work is how straightforward he sounds. Given his CV, which encompasses Faust, the Golden Palominos, Slapp Happy (his influential trio with Anthony Moore and Dagmar Krause), and ongoing work with Chris Cutler and other ex-Henry Cow musicians on ReR albums such as Just Woke Up and Hangman's Hill, you might expect something less FM-friendly than his easy-on-the-ear dad-rock. Yet the oddness is revealed in subtle twists and turns and the Lewis Carroll-like wordplay of songs such as The Unborn Byron (\"She calls him and he answers back, from the amniotic sac\"), or the funky Haiku, with its fabulous pumping chorus: \"Systole, diastole, dealing with the parts but feeling with the whole\". </p> <p>In fact to get the whole picture, you really have to buy more than one Blegvad product, and Choices Under Pressure serves as a neat promotional device for his magnum opus The Book of Leviathan (Sort of Books, \u00a312.99), drawn from the comic strip that ran for years in the Independent on Sunday. Combining anecdotes, puns, wry social comment, wild fantasy and unsentimental affection with a masterful and eclectic drawing style, Blegvad's Leviathan achieves a level of rich and surreal complexity his songs can only hint at. Blegvad the graphic artist has some fans in high places, including Matt Groening and Ben Katchor. The CD's title comes from a Leviathan strip whose first panel reads: \"Q: what defines 'character'? A: The choices a person makes under pressure.\" On the cover, the lightbulb outline of baby Leviathan can be glimpsed within a diving bell, while a thinks bubble reads: \"Eenie, meenie, minie, mo . . .\" The guy's a genius.

They have been instructed by the union to examine their contracts this weekend to examine the possibility of a work-to-rule as an initial protest against the 145 redundancies being planned by the newspaper group. An estimated 200 journalists gathered at a packed NUJ meeting in the Express canteen at 3pm today to discuss what action to take. The atmosphere was calm but determined and peppered with jokes at the expense of proprietor Richard Desmond and his management team. Staff came to the brink of instructing the NUJ to go ahead with a ballot for a strike action. Instead NUJ national newspaper organiser Jeremy Dear told journalists to \"go away and look at their contracts and see about the possibility of a work-to-rule.\" A motion was also proposed about the possibility of journalists refusing to work on other titles. However, this was not put to the vote because it was approaching press deadlines and journalists were going back to their desks. The proceedings were not all doom and gloom, however. Mr Dear raised a hollow laugh when he claimed that the editorial board assembled by Richard Desmond shortly after he took over had never actually convened. Mr Desmond put the board together to head off fears that the editorial quality of the paper would plunge under his stewardship. Journalists also wondered if jobs could be saved if they come up with alternative means of saving money.

This encouraged the trade and industry secretary, Stephen Byers, to declare the Shell deal \"an important step towards achieving full employment in all regions of the UK\". </p> <p>More than 4,000 of the new positions will be created with AMEC which has won the \u00a3300m contract to build a floating production system for the use in the Bonga field in Nigeria. The deal is the largest export contract of its kind and was won against ferocious competition from engineering group ABB which planned to use low cost Korean construction yards. </p> <p>Britain has found it difficult to land big deals outside the UK North Sea but Shell said AMEC had put together the best all-round package. </p> <p>Some industry experts suggested the oil group might have come under pressure from British politicians to place the contract in Britain but Shell insiders dismissed this. </p> <p>About 1,000 jobs will be created at AMEC's Wallsend yard on Tyneside with a further 1,100 going to subcontractors in the north east including 750 at Heerema's yard at Hartlepool. </p> <p>Other jobs will be spread around the country. Mr Byers said: \"It will put the UK in an excellent position when it comes to winning future contracts in the country [Nigeria] as well as other deep water projects.\" </p> <p>Shell officials agreed that if the contract was performed well it should provide a springboard for AMEC and others to win contracts in other burgeoning offshore areas in west Africa and South America. </p> <p>Japanese car maker Toyota said it would start making diesel engines at its Deeside plant from 2003 with the creation of 250 jobs. </p> <p>The north Wales plant produces petrol engines and plans to export engine components to other Toyota plants in South Africa and South America. </p> <p>Toyota's news follows recently announced car investment in Britain including Nissan's decision to produce the new Primera and Micra models in Sunderland, safeguarding 4,000 jobs. </p> <p>It was not all good news from the industrial sector yesterday. European Telecom, the mobile phone distributor based in Slough, Berkshire, said it would make \"significant\" redundancies from its 600 staff. </p> <p>The company said it would record a substantial loss this financial year because of worsening conditions in the mobile phones sector.</p>",

This encouraged the trade and industry secretary, Stephen Byers, to declare the Shell deal \"an important step towards achieving full employment in all regions of the UK\". More than 4,000 of the new positions will be created with AMEC which has won the \u00a3300m contract to build a floating production system for the use in the Bonga field in Nigeria. The deal is the largest export contract of its kind and was won against ferocious competition from engineering group ABB which planned to use low cost Korean construction yards. Britain has found it difficult to land big deals outside the UK North Sea but Shell said AMEC had put together the best all-round package. Some industry experts suggested the oil group might have come under pressure from British politicians to place the contract in Britain but Shell insiders dismissed this. About 1,000 jobs will be created at AMEC's Wallsend yard on Tyneside with a further 1,100 going to subcontractors in the north east including 750 at Heerema's yard at Hartlepool. Other jobs will be spread around the country. Mr Byers said: \"It will put the UK in an excellent position when it comes to winning future contracts in the country [Nigeria] as well as other deep water projects.\" Shell officials agreed that if the contract was performed well it should provide a springboard for AMEC and others to win contracts in other burgeoning offshore areas in west Africa and South America. Japanese car maker Toyota said it would start making diesel engines at its Deeside plant from 2003 with the creation of 250 jobs. The north Wales plant produces petrol engines and plans to export engine components to other Toyota plants in South Africa and South America. Toyota's news follows recently announced car investment in Britain including Nissan's decision to produce the new Primera and Micra models in Sunderland, safeguarding 4,000 jobs. It was not all good news from the industrial sector yesterday. European Telecom, the mobile phone distributor based in Slough, Berkshire, said it would make \"significant\" redundancies from its 600 staff. The company said it would record a substantial loss this financial year because of worsening conditions in the mobile phones sector.",

But his poor health has seen this job go while he retains his better paid but less demanding posts at Westminster and in the European parliament. Even before his health sagged, Mr Hume had always wielded a broad brush, like a Renaissance painter leaving the filling in of details to his apprentices.

But with his party's 1997 defeat behind him, he has spoken regularly from the backbenches with authority and assurance, and been received with the warmth his personality demands.</p> <p>And that is not the only oddity about Mr Major. He is not unique in reaching high office from a humble background, but he is certainly rare in combining the feat with a troubled childhood and basic education. Born into a south London family and trapped in debt, he went to Rutlish grammar school in a secondhand blazer when his former trapeze artist father lost his garden ornament business.</p> <p>He left at 15, with the complex of an underdog but local politics provided an escape route. Elected to Lambeth council in 1968, he eventually reached the Commons in 1979 as MP for Huntingdonshire.</p> <p>Once there his rise was quiet but unmistakable. He was made a parliamentary private secretary at the Home Office in 1981, and became a minister at the Department of Health in 1986.</p> <p>From there he was a favourite of Margaret Thatcher, becoming first chief secretary to the Treasury after the 1987 election, and replaced Sir Geoffrey Howe as foreign secretary in a shock promotion by a prime minister in trouble. By the end of the year he achieved his life's dream, becoming the chancellor of the exchequer in the wake of Nigel Lawson's resignation.</p> <p>In November 1990 he won the Conservative party leadership after Mrs Thatcher's fall.

      "bodyText": "No postwar former prime minister has made the transition from power to backbench impotence as gracefully as John Major. In office he was troubled, angry and constantly under fire. But with his party's 1997 defeat behind him, he has spoken regularly from the backbenches with authority and assurance, and been received with the warmth his personality demands. And that is not the only oddity about Mr Major. He is not unique in reaching high office from a humble background, but he is certainly rare in combining the feat with a troubled childhood and basic education. Born into a south London family and trapped in debt, he went to Rutlish grammar school in a secondhand blazer when his former trapeze artist father lost his garden ornament business. He left at 15, with the complex of an underdog but local politics provided an escape route. Elected to Lambeth council in 1968, he eventually reached the Commons in 1979 as MP for Huntingdonshire. Once there his rise was quiet but unmistakable. He was made a parliamentary private secretary at the Home Office in 1981, and became a minister at the Department of Health in 1986. From there he was a favourite of Margaret Thatcher, becoming first chief secretary to the Treasury after the 1987 election, and replaced Sir Geoffrey Howe as foreign secretary in a shock promotion by a prime minister in trouble. By the end of the year he achieved his life's dream, becoming the chancellor of the exchequer in the wake of Nigel Lawson's resignation. In November 1990 he won the Conservative party leadership after Mrs Thatcher's fall. Initial success, in the Gulf war and the 1992 general election, gave way to decline in the face of economic troubles - especially Black Wednesday - and growing hostility to Europe within his party and cabinet. Slipping behind in the polls, the election defeat in 1997 was inevitable. Heavily criticised for his inept leadership, he left office on May 2 1997, with his party's reputation for probity in tatters. But he, at least, retained some of his famed decency. His personal popularity was also intact, shown by the unexpected sale of more than 150,000 copies of his autobiography, the \u00a325,000 he commands for lectures, and his comfortable selection of boardroom jobs. Although his speeches since the election have often offered sensible advice, they are not always heeded - certainly not his warning to William Hague that moving further to the right spelled Tory \"ruin\".

Gone are the nightmares of trying to run a government around party splits and with the constant threats of revolts from both inside and outside of the cabinet. He no longer seems to feel the long-evident insecurity he revealed when, on his appointment as foreign secretary by Mrs Thatcher, he said: \"The only people [at the Foreign Office] without a degree were the porter and me.\" Out of government his confidence has grown while the hostility in the Tory party towards him diminished.

She was a crusader for civil liberties as the legal officer for the national council for civil liberties (1978-82), now called Liberty. She married into the Labour establishment when she walked down the aisle with Jack Dromey, a senior official at the T&amp;G.</p> <p>When she first entered the Commons as the MP for Peckham in 1982 she had the reputation of being a hard-leftist and endorsed \"extra-parliamentary action\". She claimed that Mrs Thatcher's mass unemployment was designed to drive down wages.</p> <p>She was later to be seen as a \"slavish Blairite\" who was close to Gordon Brown after having served as his deputy in the shadow Treasury team from 1992-1994.</p> <p>The aura of that early left reputation still hung over her when she joined the Blair camp in 1994, enabling her to be elected both to Labour's NEC and the shadow cabinet where she became health spokesperson.</p> <p>Upon entering the cabinet in 1997 she turned her back on her leftist roots and while secretary of state for social security pushed through cuts in benefits for lone parents, insisting they \"wanted to work\", whether their children were under five or over 10. She had shown this same lack of political touch in sending her children to distant selective secondary schools rather than local Southwark comprehensives, without clearing it with Blair.</p> <p>Her outspoken colleague Gwyneth Dunwoody said Ms Harman was one of those \"women who were of the opinion that they had a God-given right to be amongst the chosen\".</p> <p>Since the shock of her sacking she has returned to her roots campaigning for women and children. She was thrown into the spotlight following the murder in her constituency of Nigerian 10-year-old Damilola Taylor in November 2000. She handled the situation with dignity and avoided the opportunity to exploit his death for an attempted political comeback.

      "bodyText": "Harriet Harman was once the chilly beautiful face of New Labour, a middle class moderniser. Mr Blair consistently protected her until a series of blunders, including cutting lone parent benefits in 1997, led to her fall from grace in July 1998 when she was sacked from the cabinet as social security secretary after just 14 months. Born into a professional background, she followed her mother's footsteps and trained as a solicitor. She was a crusader for civil liberties as the legal officer for the national council for civil liberties (1978-82), now called Liberty. She married into the Labour establishment when she walked down the aisle with Jack Dromey, a senior official at the T&amp;G. When she first entered the Commons as the MP for Peckham in 1982 she had the reputation of being a hard-leftist and endorsed \"extra-parliamentary action\". She claimed that Mrs Thatcher's mass unemployment was designed to drive down wages. She was later to be seen as a \"slavish Blairite\" who was close to Gordon Brown after having served as his deputy in the shadow Treasury team from 1992-1994. The aura of that early left reputation still hung over her when she joined the Blair camp in 1994, enabling her to be elected both to Labour's NEC and the shadow cabinet where she became health spokesperson. Upon entering the cabinet in 1997 she turned her back on her leftist roots and while secretary of state for social security pushed through cuts in benefits for lone parents, insisting they \"wanted to work\", whether their children were under five or over 10. She had shown this same lack of political touch in sending her children to distant selective secondary schools rather than local Southwark comprehensives, without clearing it with Blair. Her outspoken colleague Gwyneth Dunwoody said Ms Harman was one of those \"women who were of the opinion that they had a God-given right to be amongst the chosen\". Since the shock of her sacking she has returned to her roots campaigning for women and children. She was thrown into the spotlight following the murder in her constituency of Nigerian 10-year-old Damilola Taylor in November 2000. She handled the situation with dignity and avoided the opportunity to exploit his death for an attempted political comeback. Although Ms Harman remains ambitious, she is not tasteless.

      "bodyText": "The agriculture minister, Nick Brown, has apologised for a statement he made yesterday to the Commons that led hundreds of farmers to believe their cattle would be slaughtered. Mr Brown said he accepted the statement was ambiguous and reassured farmers that the policy of three-kilometre wide slaughter zones around outbreak in Cumbria and Dumfries and Galloway would only apply automatically to pigs and sheep. Speaking at the ministry of agriculture, fisheries and food in central London, he said: \"I want to apologise on my own behalf and behalf of the ministry for any hurt this has caused farmers.\" The number of infected farms and abattoirs today rose to 260, but some farmers warned of a \"rural revolt\" if the killings go ahead. A farmers' lobby group announced it would mount a legal challenge to the government over its handling of the outbreak. Farmers For Action said it was \"all out war\" after the government announced the mass slaughter. A spokesman for the group described the cull as \"nothing more than a sinister way of ethnically cleansing the British countryside\". He said it was \"absolutely ludicrous\" that just two days ago Britain was importing meat from countries affected by foot and mouth, such as Argentina and Zimbabwe. \"They do not want British agriculture and this is their way of doing it.\" Guns were today confiscated at the home of a farmer from Penrith, Cumbria, who allegedly threatened Maff officials about to cull his herd. A spokesman for Cumbria police confirmed the incident had happened but would not specify the type or number of weapons. No other legal action was being taken against the farmer. Mr Brown urged everyone involved in the livestock industry to support the government in its bid to stamp out the virus. \"The war we should be fighting is against the virus. To be fighting each other is a ridiculous thing to do,\" he said. \"I appeal to everyone to work with the government and to work together to defeat this virus.\" The National Farmer's Union president, Ben Gill, said that Britain's farming industry faces months of torture as the toll from the disease continues to rise. He said the key objective for farmers was to wipe out the disease, but he warned that parts of the countryside would be \"idle\" for the next six months. About 90 countries, including the United States and Australia, have now banned EU live animal imports, meat and dairy products, after the disease spread to mainland Europe earlier in the week. Already 205,000 of Britain's pig, cattle and sheep population have been condemned, 75% of which have been slaughtered.

Telephone votes for Celebrity Big Brother will generate around \u00a3450,000 for the charity but also about \u00a3280,000, excluding VAT, for BT. Each eviction phone vote costs 25p, of which 15.5p goes to Comic Relief. The remaining 9.5p is split between BT and the taxman, who takes a slice through VAT. Celebrity Big Brother has been a phenomenal TV ratings success with up to 10m viewers a night hooked on the strife at the east London house. And viewers have been phoning in eviction votes in their droves. An astonishing 742,885 calls were made the night Chris Eubank was evicted. This raised \u00a3115,147 for Comic Relief and \u00a370,574 for BT. The eviction of Vanessa Feltz raised \u00a3108,857 for the charity and \u00a366,719 for BT and Anthea Turner's raised \u00a3112,651 for the charity and \u00a369,044 for BT, all excluding VAT. It is estimated that at least as many viewers will be phoning in today for the final vote which will decide who wins out of Jack Dee, Boyzone's Keith Duffy or Brookside's Claire Sweeney. This will generate at least \u00a3100,000 but if the nation's interest in the show is reflected in the phone vote the final figure could be closer to \u00a3150,000 or even \u00a3200,000. Celebrity Big Brother is just one of many premium rate phone-ins for Comic Relief. Radio 4's The Funniest Thing I Ever Heard phone vote costs callers \u00a31, of which 66p goes to Comic Relief and BT keeps between 15p and 23p to cover network running costs. BT is prevented from offering the charity a discount on premium rate numbers by the telecoms regulator Oftel. Because of BT's monopoly it must treat all users the same and exceptions cannot be made for good causes, according to an Oftel spokeswoman. A BT spokeswoman said: \"We are not allowed to give a free service or a discount. But we do give a very considerable amount in different ways.\" This year the company has made a \u00a365,000 donation to Comic Relief, purchased \u00a325,000-worth of vehicle red noses and has donated volunteers to set up and run telephone lines. A spokeswoman for Comic Relief said the charity was aware of the cost involved in running the premium rate lines. \"Comic Relief recognises the disruption such a major appeal has to BT's network and that significant resource and expense is incurred by BT in managing the network,\" she said. \"BT has been supporting Comic Relief since the very first Red Nose Day; without their support, advice and assistance, Red Nose Day simply could not happen,\" she said.",

Two men and a woman were killed and several others were injured, paramedics at Medina airport said.</p> <p>Two men and a woman were killed in the operation, which lasted a few minutes. The standoff between Saudi authorities and hijackers, who were armed with knives, had lasted several hours.</p> <p>Paramedics said a woman was stabbed to death and two men were gunned down. \"As soon as the woman opened the door, she was both stabbed and shot to death,\" a paramedic, who wished to remain anonymous, said.</p> <p>There were conflicting reports over the identity of those killed. The number of hijackers was not immediately clear either. Earlier reports put the number between two and four men.</p> <p>In Moscow, aides to Kremlin envoy Sergei Yastrzhembsky said one Turkish passenger, one hijacker - \"apparently the younger one\" - and one stewardess were killed.</p> <p>One man was handcuffed and led away by Saudi security forces, said the paramedics.</p> <p>A statement from the Saudi interior ministry statement said that \"an anti-terrorism force from the special forces was able to storm the Russian plane ... and was able to free all the passengers in a swift operation and controlled the hijackers\".</p> <p>A surgeon who boarded the plane after the rescue operation said seven people were injured, and most of them were being treated for minor cuts and bruises.</p> <p>Earlier, as many as 46 of the 174 people aboard the plane were freed or escaped from the plane.</p> <p>The hostage drama began yesterday afternoon shortly after the plane took off from Istanbul.</p> <p>Minutes before the plane was stormed, more than 30 members of the Saudi army's special forces unit in full battle gear, armed with semiautomatic rifles and wearing helmets and bullet proof vests, were loaded into an army bus.</p> <p>About six ambulances and fire engines surrounded the plane, which was parked in an isolated area on the tarmac while Medina airport remained open to commercial flights. Two Saudi air force cargo planes were parked a few hundred meters away.</p> <p>Other members of the special forces unit were huddled in tents in the services area of the airport, out of sight of the plane. Four army vehicles and four armored personnel carriers were parked behind the tents.</p> <p>A passenger with bloody trousers was seen being carried away from the plane. Paramedics were on hand to offer first aid and medical assistance to other passengers.</p> <p>Topa Bilgetin Toker, general director of Turkish civilian aviation, said Saudi forces had stormed the plane after the pilots managed to escape from the aircraft.</p> <p>He said the decision came after the hijackers failed to establish further contact with the Saudis.</p> <p>Russia's Interfax news agency quoted Mr Yastrzhembsky as saying the storming had received the approval of Russian authorities.</p> <p>Aftayeva Fariza, a representative of the breakaway Chechen republic, who is based in Amman, Jordan, identified the hijackers as Aslambek Artsayev, the former Chechen interior minister, and his brother, Sufian. She said the information comes from a third brother, Adam, who was not among the hijackers.</p> <p>She said the reason for the hijacking was not terrorism or money, but to attract world attention to the situation in Chechnya.</p> <p>\"Adam Arsayev, the brother of Aslambek, told me over the phone that he urges the Saudi authorities not to extradite the hijackers to Moscow,\" Ms Aftayeva said.</p> <p>She also said the hijacker's brother felt sorry that people had lost their lives in the operation.

      "bodyText": "Saudi security forces stormed a hijacked Russian plane today, ending a hostage drama that left three people dead. Chechen men armed with knives had commandeered the Moscow-bound plane after takeoff from Istanbul. Two men and a woman were killed and several others were injured, paramedics at Medina airport said. Two men and a woman were killed in the operation, which lasted a few minutes. The standoff between Saudi authorities and hijackers, who were armed with knives, had lasted several hours. Paramedics said a woman was stabbed to death and two men were gunned down. \"As soon as the woman opened the door, she was both stabbed and shot to death,\" a paramedic, who wished to remain anonymous, said. There were conflicting reports over the identity of those killed. The number of hijackers was not immediately clear either. Earlier reports put the number between two and four men. In Moscow, aides to Kremlin envoy Sergei Yastrzhembsky said one Turkish passenger, one hijacker - \"apparently the younger one\" - and one stewardess were killed. One man was handcuffed and led away by Saudi security forces, said the paramedics. A statement from the Saudi interior ministry statement said that \"an anti-terrorism force from the special forces was able to storm the Russian plane ... and was able to free all the passengers in a swift operation and controlled the hijackers\". A surgeon who boarded the plane after the rescue operation said seven people were injured, and most of them were being treated for minor cuts and bruises. Earlier, as many as 46 of the 174 people aboard the plane were freed or escaped from the plane. The hostage drama began yesterday afternoon shortly after the plane took off from Istanbul. Minutes before the plane was stormed, more than 30 members of the Saudi army's special forces unit in full battle gear, armed with semiautomatic rifles and wearing helmets and bullet proof vests, were loaded into an army bus. About six ambulances and fire engines surrounded the plane, which was parked in an isolated area on the tarmac while Medina airport remained open to commercial flights. Two Saudi air force cargo planes were parked a few hundred meters away. Other members of the special forces unit were huddled in tents in the services area of the airport, out of sight of the plane. Four army vehicles and four armored personnel carriers were parked behind the tents. A passenger with bloody trousers was seen being carried away from the plane. Paramedics were on hand to offer first aid and medical assistance to other passengers. Topa Bilgetin Toker, general director of Turkish civilian aviation, said Saudi forces had stormed the plane after the pilots managed to escape from the aircraft. He said the decision came after the hijackers failed to establish further contact with the Saudis. Russia's Interfax news agency quoted Mr Yastrzhembsky as saying the storming had received the approval of Russian authorities. Aftayeva Fariza, a representative of the breakaway Chechen republic, who is based in Amman, Jordan, identified the hijackers as Aslambek Artsayev, the former Chechen interior minister, and his brother, Sufian. She said the information comes from a third brother, Adam, who was not among the hijackers. She said the reason for the hijacking was not terrorism or money, but to attract world attention to the situation in Chechnya. \"Adam Arsayev, the brother of Aslambek, told me over the phone that he urges the Saudi authorities not to extradite the hijackers to Moscow,\" Ms Aftayeva said. She also said the hijacker's brother felt sorry that people had lost their lives in the operation. That was \"not the aim of the hijackers\". An official at Medina airport, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the hijackers had earlier asked authorities to refuel the plane and prepare it for a long flight, but later changed their minds. He did not say where the hijackers had wanted to go. Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, returned from his ski vacation in Siberia today because of the hijacking. Mr Putin had planned to stay through the weekend in the republic of Khakasia, but left for Moscow as Saudi Arabian officials prepared to storm the plane in Medina.

      "bodyText": "Anthea Turner has told how OK! magazine cruelly stitched her up after signing away photographic rights to her wedding. Just hours before she was evicted from the Big Brother house, she revealed how somebody from the magazine had innocently asked her to try a Cadbury's Snowflake. The picture turned into a PR disaster for the former Breakfast TV presenter. Ms Turner was accused of being so money-grabbing as to make even her own wedding into a cash-making venture after cheesy shots of her munching the Cadbury's chocolate bar were splashed over the front page of the tabloids. Her career has since taken a downward turn. But on last night's Comic Relief Celebrity Big Brother, Turner was given the chance to vindicate herself. Asked about the famous incident by fellow contestant Jack Dee, Ms Turner protested her innocence, claiming she had known nothing about planned promotion when she allowed herself to be photographed by OK! magazine, which had exclusive rights to the wedding, eating the Snowflake bar. \"Someone from OK! asked if they could bring the chocolate along and we had a sweet stall at the wedding with jelly babies and things so we said yes, put them on there,\" said Ms Turner. \"Then at 1.30am.

Grant and I just assumed they would pick a nice photo,\" she said, adding that she had been naive. The Sun newspaper ran a highly critical piece about Ms Turner on its front page the day after the photo was released. Under the headline \"Sickener. Anthea's wedding photo is so, so sad\", the paper said: \"This is the most sickening wedding photo ever - showing Anthea Turner and Grant Bovey plugging a new chocolate bar. The picture is the only one released to newspapers by the greedy newlyweds.\" But Ms Turner last night got her own back on the promoters of the chocolate bar, who she claims duped her into the publicity shot. Asked by Mr Dee whether she liked the Snowflake she turned up her nose and said it was \"a bit sickly\". Keith Duffy then asked whether she had at least got \"a few bob\" out of it. When she replied that she had not, Mr Duffy joked: \"Jaysus, isn't that terrible when that happens and you don't even get a few bob for it?\". Ms Turner also talked about how she and husband Grant Bovey had \"wrestled\" with the fact they both had committed adultery with their respective spouses. She married Mr Bovey after she divorced her husband Peter Powell and he divorced his wife Della.",

The bank has cut Emap's valuation to within 9% of its share price to 724p. This is 75p below this morning's share price of 799p. The bank has urged the publishing and radio group to carry out \"corporate liposuction\". Commerzbank is concerned about Emap's retention of the loss-making Petersen division, which it acquired in 1999 for \u00a3900m. Recent industry speculation has estimated Petersen's disposal value at \u00a3450m. \"Since its acquisition, profit expectations have virtually halved,\" Commerzbank analysts noted in a report on Emap. \"Not only has Petersen been a significant drag on the company's earnings - missing all nine of the market's forecasts - but it has also been a major drain on the management's time. \"We are particularly concerned about the fundamental lack of top-line growth in the core magazine businesses. \"Margins have been squeezed and the launch culture has been eroded,\" the analysts added. Commerzbank has also questioned Emap's short-term prospects. It is seeking clarification as to \"the extent to which the current slowdown in growth is a cyclical [advertising] issue and therefore temporary, or whether the group's current woes are predominantly a structural problem\". The devaluation comes after several months of turmoil for Emap, fulled by speculation it may have to sell its business titles to survive. Relegation from the FTSE-100 index late last year also came as a blow, following the crash of Emap's share price from a high of 1800p to 774p.",

As the hype surrounding the show escalated, Channel 4 broadcast a whole hour of Big Brother in two half-hour segments last night. This was followed by a late-night broadcast on BBC1. The first episode, in which Anthea left the Big Brother house to be reunited with her husband Grant Bovey, hooked in 5.2m viewers to give Channel 4 21 % share of the audience, according to unofficial overnight figures. A second edition of the programme on Channel 4, at 10.30pm was watched by 4.8m viewers - a 31% audience share. The BBC programme pulled in 2m viewers, 28% of audience share. However, Big Brother's first showing on Channel 4 at 9pm had fewer viewers than the previous night's instalment, which took 6.9m and 27% of the audience. But last night's early edition was not helped by aggressive scheduling from the BBC and ITV. Peak Practice gained 7.2m viewers and a 30% audience share on ITV. Meanwhile, the tail-end of Match of the Day Live's coverage of Liverpool v Porto in the UEFA cup on BBC1 pulled in 7.3m viewers and 30% of the audience. Elsewhere, 800,000 viewers tuned in to see the final of Touching the Truck on Channel 5. The endurance show gained a 3% audience share - a drop of 200,000 from the programme's first-night high of 1m viewers.

      "main": "<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-330402796\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2001/03/16/EdwardBernays1.jpg\" alt=\"Edward Bernays\" width=\"128\" height=\"128\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>",
      "body": "<p>When Edward Bernays, who has died aged 103, ran the first course in public relations at New York University in 1923, he spoke on \"the technique and method of reaching the public, with particular emphasis on the newspaper, the periodic press, the pulpit, the motion picture, and other avenues of approach to the public\". </p> <p>The same year, Bernays wrote the first book on public relations, Crystallising Public Opinion. In counselling clients on their public relations he left behind the one-way ideas of propaganda or publicity. He took into account \"all the relations you had with all of your publics\". He moved rapidly from mass communication to targeting specific audiences: he added the \"s\" to public. </p> <p>By 1965, he was writing in his autobiography, Biography Of An Idea: \"From a one-way street of information and persuasion from client to public, it became a two-way street, with the element of adjustment added... Counsel on public relations was based on dealing with interaction between client and public.\" He wrote 14 books in all, one called The Engineering Of Consent raising the problem of who adapts - client or public. </p> <p>Bernays was born in Vienna but was taken to New York as a small child. He married Doris Fleischman, whom he met when he was 16, in 1922, having formed his business with her three years earlier. A feminist, she kept her maiden name and was the first American woman to use it on her passport. They were in business together until she died in 1980. </p> <p>Bernays linked public relations studies closely to social science, and to the importance of influencing \"group leaders\" or \"opinion formers\".

      "bodyText": "When Edward Bernays, who has died aged 103, ran the first course in public relations at New York University in 1923, he spoke on \"the technique and method of reaching the public, with particular emphasis on the newspaper, the periodic press, the pulpit, the motion picture, and other avenues of approach to the public\". The same year, Bernays wrote the first book on public relations, Crystallising Public Opinion. In counselling clients on their public relations he left behind the one-way ideas of propaganda or publicity. He took into account \"all the relations you had with all of your publics\". He moved rapidly from mass communication to targeting specific audiences: he added the \"s\" to public. By 1965, he was writing in his autobiography, Biography Of An Idea: \"From a one-way street of information and persuasion from client to public, it became a two-way street, with the element of adjustment added... Counsel on public relations was based on dealing with interaction between client and public.\" He wrote 14 books in all, one called The Engineering Of Consent raising the problem of who adapts - client or public. Bernays was born in Vienna but was taken to New York as a small child. He married Doris Fleischman, whom he met when he was 16, in 1922, having formed his business with her three years earlier. A feminist, she kept her maiden name and was the first American woman to use it on her passport. They were in business together until she died in 1980. Bernays linked public relations studies closely to social science, and to the importance of influencing \"group leaders\" or \"opinion formers\". Thus he persuaded a nomadic labour force of Indians to eat a new type of corn by having the shaman of the tribe bless it - solving a company's labour problem. And he persuaded Americans to eat more (of his client's) bacon by publishing a survey of 5,000 doctors who confirmed the need for a more substantial breakfast than coffee and rolls. The nephew of Sigmund Freud, he was aware of psychology. \"Never attack the ego of your superior by stating that he is wrong and you are right... it is much easier to gain acceptance by quoting authority, giving reasons for your point of view or referring to tradition, than telling someone that he is wrong.' His creative imagination in countering poor images became legend at the highest levels. \"(President) Coolidge looks as though he had been weaned on a pickle,\" said Alice Roosevelt Longworth.

      "bodyText": "Europe minister Keith Vaz was clinging on to his political career by his fingertips today after the publication of document detailing how he obstructed a Commons inquiry into his constituency. Earlier this week, the Commons standards commissioner, Elizabeth Filkin, was forced to clear the Leicester East MP over allegations into election donations due to a lack of evidence. Today she published the appendix to her report laying out correspondence between her committee and the minister. The 291-page report publishes 20 letters between Mr Vaz and the inquiry, plus a transcript of oral evidence given to the investigation. The document reveals that in evidence given to the committee behind closed doors, Mr Vaz suggested that Ms Filkin may have had a conflict of interest in the investigation because of her personal acquaintance with the former Leicester city council leader, Sir Peter Soulsby. Mr Vaz said: \"It is a matter of fact that he is the only witness that she knows personally. One should just bear this fact in mind on the issue of conflict of interest.\" Mr Vaz also told the committee he believed that the investigations into him were at least in part motivated by his race. \"I think that people do not understand the Asian community and the way in which they operate.

Today the Conservative party chairman, Michael Ancram, said: \"He is saying he has been cleared because he hasn't been found guilty. \"But all the evidence we have heard so far, particularly from Ms Filkin, suggests that the reason he hasn't been found guilty is because he wasn't prepared to cooperate with the committee and give sufficient information.\" At this week's prime minister's questions, William Hague taunted Tony Blair: \"You can keep your reputation, or you can keep your minister - but you cannot do both.\" The original report from the standards and privileges committee cleared the MP of all but one of the allegations made against him - but criticised his reluctance to cooperate with Ms Filkin's investigation. Her own inquiry had concluded that she could not fully investigate eight of the charges because of problems getting evidence from Mr Vaz and other witnesses. One complaint - that he should have declared a financial link to a constituent he nominated for an honour - was upheld. Mr Ancram went on to say that it was not just Mr Vaz's judgment at stake but the prime minister's. \"We have seen him turning his back on accusations against his foreign secretary for misleading parliament,\" he said. \"We now see him supporting Mr Vaz.

      "body": "<p>Trinity Mirror yesterday became the latest traditional media firm to scale back its investment in the internet when it announced the closure of several websites and the loss of 60 jobs. </p> <p>The company, owner of the Mirror newspapers and the largest publisher of regional titles in Britain, has reduced its online spend from the \u00a3150m flagged 12 months ago to \u00a390m in the next three years. </p> <p>It is closing the icShowbiz and icSport websites and has abandoned the launch of lifestyle site icChoice. Trinity Mirror confirmed that talks have opened for the sale of its internet service provider, ic24, which has 240,000 active users. </p> <p>The shake-up is part of a wider review of the group formed from the merger of Trinity and Mirror Group more than 18 months ago. The review began in November and will see the sale of the magazines and exhibitions division which includes specialist medical and housebuilding titles. PA Sporting Life which comprises Sportinglife.com and Totalbet will also be sold. </p> <p>Analysts estimate the magazines will fetch around \u00a350m, Sportinglife another \u00a325m and ic24 about \u00a312m. </p> <p>Philip Graf, the chief executive, said Trinity Mirror had learned a lot from its experiences with the internet and underlined the group's commitment to a network of regional websites using the \"ic\" brand. </p> <p>He said: \"Some of the early predictions of the shift of revenues from newspapers to the internet were clearly overdone. We had thought it would be enough to be a top five player but with the advertising market online not as big as some had anticipated you really need to be top three.\" </p> <p>Mr Graf added: \"We are still very confident of the opportunity provided by the internet where we have a distinctive capability, like the regional network.\" </p> <p>The online division, which employs around 400 people, is forecast to record revenues of around \u00a325m this year and will have 12 regional sites up by the end of the month. </p> <p>Despite the retrenchment, Trinity Mirror pleased investors with a strong set of full year results for 2000. Pretax profits before internet losses of \u00a342m were 12.2% higher at \u00a3196m. Revenues were 5.3% better and just exceeded \u00a31bn. </p> <p>The company also provided positive news of the present trading environment. Mr Graf said advertising revenues across the national titles were 9% higher in the first two months of the year, while the regional titles were 7% higher. </p> <p>The shares climbed 27.5p to 486p.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Trinity Mirror yesterday became the latest traditional media firm to scale back its investment in the internet when it announced the closure of several websites and the loss of 60 jobs. The company, owner of the Mirror newspapers and the largest publisher of regional titles in Britain, has reduced its online spend from the \u00a3150m flagged 12 months ago to \u00a390m in the next three years. It is closing the icShowbiz and icSport websites and has abandoned the launch of lifestyle site icChoice. Trinity Mirror confirmed that talks have opened for the sale of its internet service provider, ic24, which has 240,000 active users. The shake-up is part of a wider review of the group formed from the merger of Trinity and Mirror Group more than 18 months ago. The review began in November and will see the sale of the magazines and exhibitions division which includes specialist medical and housebuilding titles. PA Sporting Life which comprises Sportinglife.com and Totalbet will also be sold. Analysts estimate the magazines will fetch around \u00a350m, Sportinglife another \u00a325m and ic24 about \u00a312m. Philip Graf, the chief executive, said Trinity Mirror had learned a lot from its experiences with the internet and underlined the group's commitment to a network of regional websites using the \"ic\" brand. He said: \"Some of the early predictions of the shift of revenues from newspapers to the internet were clearly overdone. We had thought it would be enough to be a top five player but with the advertising market online not as big as some had anticipated you really need to be top three.\" Mr Graf added: \"We are still very confident of the opportunity provided by the internet where we have a distinctive capability, like the regional network.\" The online division, which employs around 400 people, is forecast to record revenues of around \u00a325m this year and will have 12 regional sites up by the end of the month. Despite the retrenchment, Trinity Mirror pleased investors with a strong set of full year results for 2000. Pretax profits before internet losses of \u00a342m were 12.2% higher at \u00a3196m. Revenues were 5.3% better and just exceeded \u00a31bn. The company also provided positive news of the present trading environment. Mr Graf said advertising revenues across the national titles were 9% higher in the first two months of the year, while the regional titles were 7% higher. The shares climbed 27.5p to 486p.",

But in the past couple of years he has become even better known for his relationship with Lis Murdoch, which ended earlier this year shortly after the birth of their child. Mr Freud has provided endless tabloid story fodder with a client list that has included Chris Evans, Geri Halliwell and Zoe Ball. His company's less high-profile but more lucrative corporate business has featured names including Planet Hollywood, Pepsi, BT, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Unilever and BSkyB. Freud Communications was set up in 1985. Nine years later, Mr Freud sold it to Abbott Mead Vickers for \u00a310m. It has recently been reported that he and the firm's other directors are keen to buy it back. It is now said to be valued at around \u00a315m. In recent years Mr Freud has branched out from media and showbiz PR, befriending Peter Mandelson and getting involved as an adviser to the Millennium Dome. He also put money into Hartford, owner of a string of fashionable restaurants including Pharmacy, and dot.com incubator Oxygen. But Mr Freud quit the Hartford board last November after the firm incurred heavy losses. And one of Oxygen's main investments, online retailer Toyzone.co.uk, closed at the beginning of the month. His most recent entrepreneurial scheme is a bid to take over Soho's Groucho Club. Mr Freud has two sons by his ex-wife, Caroline Hutton. He is the son of writer and former Liberal MP Sir Clement Freud, sister of broadcaster Emma and nephew of artist Lucian.

But not to act in this way would be even more disastrous for Britain's livestock farmers. If we do not try to cull ahead of the disease then even more animals will be affected.\"</p> <p>The most dramatic measures are being taken in the worst centres of the disease in Cumbria and across the Scottish border in Dumfries and Galloway. The disease is spreading from farm to farm and to stop it \"fire breaks\" will be created 3km around each outbreak where all animals will be killed. Outbreaks are already so frequent that the exclusion zones overlap. Whole swaths of countryside currently dotted with sheep and cattle will have all animals removed.</p> <p>Elsewhere all sheep which have been through Longtown in Cumbria, Welshpool in mid-Wales and Northampton markets from mid-February will be killed, and thousands of animals handled by the two main sheep dealers, Willy Cleave, of Burdon Farm, Highampton in Devon, and Kevin Feakins, of Llancloudy, Ross-on-Wye, will be destroyed. Both men have already lost all their own animals.</p> <p>All animals taken into the current disease-free areas of mid and northern Scotland, west Wales and East Anglia since mid-February will be traced and slaughtered as a precaution. The idea is to save the tourist industry in those areas and prevent further spread of the infection.</p> <p>With the disease still spreading yesterday the number of animals to be killed under existing measures rose to more than 219,000. This is already half the total number killed in the six months of the 1967 epidemic. Mr Brown, in a statement to the House of Commons, did not mention the vast numbers of animals involved in the new cull - about 2% of the 55m farm animals in the country - partly because precise figures are hard to obtain.</p> <p>In Scotland, the rural affairs minister, Ross Finnie, put the figure in Dumfries and Galloway at 200,000 sheep in 500 farms, with a smaller number of cattle, probably 20,000. Cumbria is expected to lose at least as many sheep.</p> <p>The restrictions on movement elsewhere have trapped up to half a million animals, mostly sheep in winter pastures. They need to be moved to summer pastures but have been forced to stay put because of movement restrictions. A licence scheme to move some of them will be in operation over the weekend but many will not qualify because they are trapped in exclusion zones and farmers who decide to have sheep and their lambs put down on welfare grounds will get compensation.</p> <p>Mr Brown said: \"I want to express my deepest sympathy for those farmers who have lost their herds and their flocks, and to wider farming communities who are going through a terrible time of uncertainty and distress. If the whole country works together and works constructively then we will get through this.\"</p> <p>William Hague welcomed the new measures, saying they were \"sensible\".</p> <p>More support came from James Black, chairman of the National Pig Association, whose members are still recovering from the classical swine fever outbreak last autumn. He said: \"The trauma experienced by our members, both financial and emotional, is too hard to contemplate, and this epidemic will have an incalculable effect upon British agriculture.</p> <p>\"We support the difficult veterinary judgments that have to be made and we shall continue to work and support all those who are working to bring this disease under control.\" <br><br></p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,443686,00.html\">Full list: outbreaks and precautionary measures</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\">Causes and effects</a></p> <p><b>The front line</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html\">06.03.2001: Meet our panel</a><br>What is the situation on the ground?

Mr Brown, in a statement to the House of Commons, did not mention the vast numbers of animals involved in the new cull - about 2% of the 55m farm animals in the country - partly because precise figures are hard to obtain. In Scotland, the rural affairs minister, Ross Finnie, put the figure in Dumfries and Galloway at 200,000 sheep in 500 farms, with a smaller number of cattle, probably 20,000. Cumbria is expected to lose at least as many sheep. The restrictions on movement elsewhere have trapped up to half a million animals, mostly sheep in winter pastures. They need to be moved to summer pastures but have been forced to stay put because of movement restrictions. A licence scheme to move some of them will be in operation over the weekend but many will not qualify because they are trapped in exclusion zones and farmers who decide to have sheep and their lambs put down on welfare grounds will get compensation. Mr Brown said: \"I want to express my deepest sympathy for those farmers who have lost their herds and their flocks, and to wider farming communities who are going through a terrible time of uncertainty and distress. If the whole country works together and works constructively then we will get through this.\" William Hague welcomed the new measures, saying they were \"sensible\". More support came from James Black, chairman of the National Pig Association, whose members are still recovering from the classical swine fever outbreak last autumn. He said: \"The trauma experienced by our members, both financial and emotional, is too hard to contemplate, and this epidemic will have an incalculable effect upon British agriculture. \"We support the difficult veterinary judgments that have to be made and we shall continue to work and support all those who are working to bring this disease under control.\" What's going on?

      "bodyText": "Department heads at the Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday have been asked to trim 10% from their budgets over the course of the next financial year - and some editorial staff may face redundancy. For news and features reporters, the cuts so far have only meant a tightening of the expenses purse strings. Staff have been asked to be more frugal with hospitality and the use of taxis. But the subs desk has already felt the cuts. At least one senior sub-editor has been made redundant in the past week and insiders say further cuts are possible. Sources say the department has been asked to scale back the use of freelances and more redundancies have not been ruled out. Associated Newspapers was unavailable for comment. News of cuts at Associated - a cash-rich business with a reputation for being one of the industry's best-resourced newspaper publishers - is likely to be received with some surprise. The move by the Mail and Mail on Sunday, which are known to spend more on editorial than most of their rivals, suggests newspapers across the board are bracing themselves for a downturn. Rising paper costs and an advertising slowdown are curtailing some of the spending excesses of the past few years. At least two newspapers have imposed a recruitment freeze. And insiders say that although the Mail is outwardly confident as it squares up to take on the Express, the cost of price-cutting and promotion will run into millions.

      "bodyText": "Council tax bills in England and Wales are set to rise by more than twice the rate of inflation, busting government targets designed to keep increases low in the run up to the general election. Local government minister Hilary Armstrong told councils in January that she expected most of them to keep tax rises below last year's average band D increase of 6.1%. Today, however, research from the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (Cipfa) reveals that local authorities in England and Wales have missed that target, and predicts average band D increases of 6.4%, bringing the average band D bill to \u00a3891. Council tax bills will hit the nation's doormats at the height of campaigning for the expected May general election, and ministers have been keen to ensure large increases do not damage Labour's prospects. In January, they unveiled nearly \u00a3190m in targeted funding to help local authorities dampen their tax rises. The figure is doubly embarrassing for ministers because it bucks an overall downward trend in increases, which have been falling since Labour came to power. It comes despite an overall increase of more than 7% in this year's local government finance settlement. The government is currently refusing to accept that Cipfa's figures are definitive, saying that the Department of the Environment does not yet have budget information from all authorities, and so will not comment in depth on what the final figures might be. A government spokesman did say: \"With inflation low and stable and with the big increase in central government grant this year, ministers will be disappointed if the overall downward trend has not continued.\" Ministers still have powers to cap council tax increases, and the spokesman said they would look carefully at whether any individual authority had set an excessive figure. The Conservatives, who had predicted that tax increases could reach as high as 9%, leapt on the figures as proof that Labour was hiking up so-called \"stealth taxes\". Shadow environment secretary Archie Norman said: \"Under Labour, council tax has become the ultimate stealth tax, piled onto taxpayers without any improvement in services. Their fuel taxes, pension taxes, extra regulations and bureaucracy have all pushed up the costs of local councils.\" London topped the increases, posting an average band D rise of 8.5%, a figure that has been inflated by the precept increase imposed by the Greater London Authority, which put nearly \u00a330 on band D bills. The traditionally high taxing metropolitan authorities posted the lowest increases, averaging 5.4%, but their bills remain the highest in the country at an average \u00a3968. Four out five of those authorities which bill for council tax responded to the survey, and Cipfa says it does not expect the final outcome to be significantly different from today's figures.",

      "bodyText": "The Indian coalition government descended further into further crisis last night when the defence minister, George Fernandes, was forced by a deepening arms bribery scandal to resign. Three days ago an internet site claimed that he presided over a ministry riddled with corruption. His resignation came after a key member left the coalition in protest. Three other ministers from his Samata party also resigned. In a halting speech broadcast last night on state television, Mr Fernandes said he was innocent and resigning only to preserve the morale of the armed forces. The president of Samata, Jaya Jaitly, also quit yesterday after being secretly filmed accepting more than \u00a33,000 at Mr Fernandes's residence from journalists posing as representatives of a fictitious London arms company, West End. They also obtained video footage of generals, politicians and senior officials accepting large amounts of cash to help secure an arms contract. It was not clear last night whether the government can ride out the storm. Most worrying to the prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, is the fact that the videotapes appear to implicate both his private office and his most trusted aide, the national security adviser Brajesh Mishra, in the defence scandal. The website which carried out the expos\u00e9, www.tehelka.com, continued to pile on the pressure yesterday. It released a tape of Bangara Laxman, president of Mr Vajpayee's party, the Bharatiya Janata party, saying that Mr Mishra played a crucial role in \"defence issues\", and adding: \"We normally turn to him.\" Mr Laxman resigned on Tuesday after being filmed putting a \u00a31,500 bribe in his desk drawer. Last night observers were speculating whether Mr Fernandes would reveal further offences at the heart of government. Hours before Mr Fernandes left, the leader of the Trinamool Congress party, Mamata Banerjee - who had demanded a corruption inquiry - announced that she and her nine MPs were leaving the coalition. The government still has a majority of 19 in the 545-seat lower house. Both houses were adjourned in uproar for a second day yesterday. The normally divided opposition, led by the Congress party, has called on the government to quit. The defence ministry has suspended four officials featured in the documentary.",

The meat business has also stabilised, with stocks plentiful and prices, if anything, easing back towards pre-crisis levels.</p> <p>It would be tempting to fall back on the old saw, that no news is good news. But the foot and mouth news, even if it is not being generated in our West Oxfordshire backyard, is as grim as it could be.</p> <p><b>The farmers</b></p> <p>The farmer Marilyn Ivings, even in the midst of the crisis, is unfailingly cheerful. But today her voice breaks, as she tells of watching a Cumbrian farmer friend on the television news last night.</p> <p>\"I was very upset. I'm afraid I had to cry. Oh dear, I think I'm going to cry again now, it was so awful,\" she said. Les Armstrong, her friend, had just seen his sheep and cattle slaughtered.</p> <p>\"He's a big man, very strong, a natural leader,\" Marilyn went on. \"But when I saw him last night, he looked bent, doubled up. He looked grey...\" Her voice tails off.</p> <p>The 'what if it happened here?' factor is a inescapable part of farming these days. For non-farmers, it's an unimaginable anxiety. \"Even for me - and I am a farmer - it' impossible to think what it must be like,\" said Marilyn.</p> <p>\"They asked the man's wife at Chesterton [where the disease has been confirmed, in the south of the county] what it was like after the animals had all been killed, and she said the thing she noticed most was the silence.\"</p> <p>Marilyn paused. \"No more animal noises. No, I can't imagine that.\"</p> <p>For the moment, happily, the 35 suckler cows Marilyn and husband Ted look after at Mill Farm, Church Enstone, are perfectly healthy.</p> <p>No thanks, though, to the walkers who still insist on using the footpaths and bridleways in the area.</p> <p>Marilyn saw two women this morning, walking their dog along the footpath that runs through their farmhouse yard. Fortunately, the cattle are kept some distance away, and the only animals in the yard - chickens, ducks, dogs and cats - are non-susceptible to foot and mouth.</p> <p>Still, it seems incredible that there are still countryside users who believe their 'rights' are more important than the deadly risk of spreading the disease.</p> <p><b>The caterers</b></p> <p>Most people are aware of the risks, and are keeping away. That's bad news for Brian Galbraith and partner Jan Blackburn, who run the smart bar-restaurant, Stones, in the heart of Chipping Norton.</p> <p>The pattern of business has altered completely in the past two weeks, with lunchtime deadly quiet and predominantly local trade in the evening.</p> <p>\"We have done a little better this week than last, and we are keeping our heads above water,\" said Brian. \"But in financial terms, the point is that we had a good December, and January was okay - but it is now that we are having to pay our December and January bills.\"</p> <p>Jan, more used to producing home-cooked meals for a steady stream of lunchtime customers, now has time to talk in the pleasant restaurant.</p> <p>\"It's the lunchtimes I can't stand. I like to be busy, but this\" - she nods at the handful of customers - \"it's just dreadful.\"</p> <p>The Cheltenham Festival, if it goes ahead, should bring back some cheer to the local tourist trade, and provide a fillip for Brian's other business, a chauffeur service.</p> <p>But looking ahead to Easter, when a rising tide of tourists normally comes through the town on its way to the Cotswolds, the outlook remains clouded with uncertainty.</p> <p><b>The butcher</b></p> <p>Businesses geared to the tourist trade are clearly feeling the pinch, but others have weathered the immediate crisis. After a difficult first week, in which supplies were tricky and prices under pressure, butcher John Kench is noticing some interesting new trends.</p> <p>\"I can't be certain of course, but I am fairly sure we are getting some customers in who normally go to the supermarkets. People are becoming ever more aware of things like food hygiene and quality and above all, traceability - ie is it British produced?</p> <p>\"I have certificates in my window about my Orkney beef and a lot of people are stopping and reading them. They want to know where the goods are from,\" he said.</p> <p>Early fears about panic buying have ebbed, and there is certainly no sign of it on John's well-stocked counters. Nor is there any evidence that consumers are turning away from meat.</p> <p>\"My sales have been strong. I'm probably doing better than this time last year, but it's difficult to say why exactly because the business is building up anyway,\" he said.</p> <p>On prices, most lines are stable and there could even be a slackening of bacon and pork prices, which rose sharply in the early days of the crisis.</p> <p><b>The Co-op</b></p> <p>It's much the same story at the Chipping Norton Co-op supermarket, where shelves are healthily stocked with most kinds of meat, fresh and frozen.</p> <p>\"Prices haven't changed at all, although we have cut back on some of our promotions. Where we used to offer chicken fillets on a buy one get one free basis, now we are saying buy one, get another one at half price,\" said duty manager Mark Corbett.</p> <p>The Co-op's buy-British policy is under pressure, though Mark says most of the meat on display is still UK-produced. \"It's very frustrating for the buyers.</p> <p>\"The company is trying to keep British, but if it comes to it, we will have to look elsewhere to keep the customers supplied.\"</p> <p><a href=\"MAIL TO:DBROWN445@AOL.COM\">dbrown445@aol.com</a></p> <p><b>The front line</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html\">06.03.2001: Meet our panel</a><br>The first in our front line series.<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,451194,00.html\">13.03.01: The town is 'uncannily quiet'</a></p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,443686,00.html\">Full list: outbreaks and precautionary measures</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\">Causes and effects</a></p> <p><b>The issue explained</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theissues/article/0,6512,441031,00.html  \">Foot and mouth</a></p> <p><b>Farmer's diary</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,450988,00.html\">13.03.2001: Lambing looms - and we could be working for nothing</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,457611,00.htm\">16.03.01: Ministers gamble on mass cull</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,457612,00.html\">16.03.01: New battle for a family under siege</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,457584,00.html\">16.03.01: Voters cool over plan for May poll</a><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,457597,00.html\">16.03.01: Slaughter policy brings fresh problems</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,457610,00.html\">16.03.01: Debate rages over rights of way policy</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,457466,00.html\">16.03.01: All doing our bit</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,457468,00.html\">16.03.01: On the farm</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,457607,00.html\">16.03.01: Overseas measures</a></p> <p><b>Interactive guides</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/flash/0,7365,443772,00.html\">How the virus spread across Britain</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/country/flash/0,6189,191473,00.html\">The countryside in crisis</a></p> <p><b>Graphics</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,443231,00.html\">Map of confirmed cases so far</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,441929,00.html\">Computerised image of the virus</a><br></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,443237,00.html\">The story in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br><a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7f681\">What do you think?</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/food/\">What's wrong with our food?</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/bse/\">BSE</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/country/0,2759,181093,00.html\">Countryside in crisis</a></p> <p><b>NetNotes</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/netnotes/article/0,6729,440983,00.html\">Pigs - the story in links</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.maff.gov.uk\" target=\"_new\">Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</a><br><a href=\"http://www.maff.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/fmd\" target=\"_new\">Maff information and factsheets</a><br> <a href=\"http://europa.eu.int/eur-lex/en/lif/dat/1985/en_385L0511.html\" target=\"_new\">EU legislation on the disease</a><br><a href=\"http://www.nfu.org.uk/info/f&amp;ml.asp\" target=\"_new\">National Farmers' Union</a><br><a href=\"http://www.mlc.org.uk\" target=\"_new\">Meat and livestock commission</a><br><a href=\"http://www.npa-uk.net\" target=\"_new\">National Pig Association</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.oie.int/eng/maladies/fiches/A_A010.HTM\" target=\"_new\">World organisation for animal health: foot and mouth disease</a><br><a href=\"http://www.equine-world.co.uk/equestrian_news\\footandmouth.htm\" target=\"_new&quot;\">Advice for horse owners - Equine World</a></p>",

I'm probably doing better than this time last year, but it's difficult to say why exactly because the business is building up anyway,\" he said. On prices, most lines are stable and there could even be a slackening of bacon and pork prices, which rose sharply in the early days of the crisis. The Co-op It's much the same story at the Chipping Norton Co-op supermarket, where shelves are healthily stocked with most kinds of meat, fresh and frozen. \"Prices haven't changed at all, although we have cut back on some of our promotions. Where we used to offer chicken fillets on a buy one get one free basis, now we are saying buy one, get another one at half price,\" said duty manager Mark Corbett. The Co-op's buy-British policy is under pressure, though Mark says most of the meat on display is still UK-produced. \"It's very frustrating for the buyers. \"The company is trying to keep British, but if it comes to it, we will have to look elsewhere to keep the customers supplied.\" dbrown445@aol.com The front line 06.03.2001: Meet our panel The first in our front line series.13.03.01: The town is 'uncannily quiet' What's going on?

The two 45-minute programmes will go out in Channel 5's regular Oprah 1pm slot on Monday and Tuesday. The shows brought the two couples involved in the internet baby adoption row, the Kilshaws and the Allens, face to face for the first time. The US couple, the Allens, originally adopted the twin girls at the centre of the row, but they were then brought to England by the Kilshaws. The eight-month-old twins are now in foster care in the UK, while the adoption issue is settled in the US courts. The Oprah shows on the affair went out in the US at the beginning of February. Channel 5's lawyers have been looking at the shows and have now decided they can be transmitted in the UK, according to a spokesman. \"We have decided to broadcast the show because we feel it is a matter of interest to the public,\" he said. \"It shows the dangers of adopting babies from abroad and over the internet,\" he added. \"People all over the world have seen the programme, so should people in the UK. \"We are confident the programmes can in no way harm the young babies involved or the proper administration of the court proceedings in the US.\"",

      "body": "<p>There are ominous signs that old-fashioned \"Nimbyism\" has taken a nasty turn for the worse and is being entangled with sheer prejudice and misinformation into local campaigns that could make it almost impossible to develop new mental health facilities in many parts of the country.</p> <p>The Unison branch at the south London and Maudsley mental health trust (Slam) has recently been caught up in a particularly vicious \"not in my back yard\" battle. The trust planned to expand the services on the Cane Hill hospital site near Croydon to include a new medium secure unit (MSU).</p> <p>Slam has seen huge holes blown through its budgets because of the costs of outplacements into beds in the private sector, and Unison has been campaigning for years for an expansion of in-house provision to cut costs and improve the quality of care. Unison, then, was 100% behind the plan to expand the services on the neglected Cane Hill site to create 200 new beds, including the MSU.</p> <p>In these circumstances, you expect some public fears to surface and the trust worked flat out to deal with them and to offer the safeguards and reassurances people needed. But it's impossible to engage in a rational debate when the opposition campaign pitches itself along the lines of \"Gangs of paedophiles set to descend on local schools\" - which is what the Cane Hill proposal found itself up against.</p> <p>The climate was not a million miles away from the vigilantism in Portsmouth and other towns last year surrounding the anti-paedophile campaign. </p> <p>Pictures of managers from the trust were posted on the anti-Cane Hill campaign's website alongside torrents of personal abuse. Caught in the middle of the battle was staff. At least one nurse was assaulted by local youths who mistook him for a patient and kids took to driving up to the isolated hospital buildings and hurling stones before speeding off into the night.</p> <p>The whole episode proved just how easily genuine fears and concerns can be hijacked by mob rule, and just before Christmas the council threw out the planning application for the new unit. At least one Labour councillor received anonymous threats of physical violence as the ugly mood was whipped up to fever pitch.</p> <p>So what next? Slam may appeal against the decision but it still leaves it in limbo. Meanwhile, the trust's budget is being bled dry by private outplacements and many managers are wondering whether they would have any prospect of getting a similar proposal approved elsewhere if a mirror-image campaign were to spring into life.</p> <p>The nonsense is that the same people who will fight dirty to stop a new unit being built in their area would be the first to demand that people with severe mental health problems be swept from the streets as long as it isn't into their back yard. The growth of the internet, and the anonymity that goes with it, means opposition campaigns can set the pace and whip up fear with virtual impunity.</p> <p>The only solution is a campaign led from the top to break down the prejudice that can so easily be ignited against people with mental health problems and the services they so desperately need. Until that happens, and at a level that can have a real impact, the Nimby's and the vigilantes will continue to control the local planning agenda.</p>",

      "bodyText": "There are ominous signs that old-fashioned \"Nimbyism\" has taken a nasty turn for the worse and is being entangled with sheer prejudice and misinformation into local campaigns that could make it almost impossible to develop new mental health facilities in many parts of the country. The Unison branch at the south London and Maudsley mental health trust (Slam) has recently been caught up in a particularly vicious \"not in my back yard\" battle. The trust planned to expand the services on the Cane Hill hospital site near Croydon to include a new medium secure unit (MSU). Slam has seen huge holes blown through its budgets because of the costs of outplacements into beds in the private sector, and Unison has been campaigning for years for an expansion of in-house provision to cut costs and improve the quality of care. Unison, then, was 100% behind the plan to expand the services on the neglected Cane Hill site to create 200 new beds, including the MSU. In these circumstances, you expect some public fears to surface and the trust worked flat out to deal with them and to offer the safeguards and reassurances people needed. But it's impossible to engage in a rational debate when the opposition campaign pitches itself along the lines of \"Gangs of paedophiles set to descend on local schools\" - which is what the Cane Hill proposal found itself up against. The climate was not a million miles away from the vigilantism in Portsmouth and other towns last year surrounding the anti-paedophile campaign. Pictures of managers from the trust were posted on the anti-Cane Hill campaign's website alongside torrents of personal abuse. Caught in the middle of the battle was staff. At least one nurse was assaulted by local youths who mistook him for a patient and kids took to driving up to the isolated hospital buildings and hurling stones before speeding off into the night. The whole episode proved just how easily genuine fears and concerns can be hijacked by mob rule, and just before Christmas the council threw out the planning application for the new unit. At least one Labour councillor received anonymous threats of physical violence as the ugly mood was whipped up to fever pitch. So what next? Slam may appeal against the decision but it still leaves it in limbo. Meanwhile, the trust's budget is being bled dry by private outplacements and many managers are wondering whether they would have any prospect of getting a similar proposal approved elsewhere if a mirror-image campaign were to spring into life. The nonsense is that the same people who will fight dirty to stop a new unit being built in their area would be the first to demand that people with severe mental health problems be swept from the streets as long as it isn't into their back yard. The growth of the internet, and the anonymity that goes with it, means opposition campaigns can set the pace and whip up fear with virtual impunity. The only solution is a campaign led from the top to break down the prejudice that can so easily be ignited against people with mental health problems and the services they so desperately need. Until that happens, and at a level that can have a real impact, the Nimby's and the vigilantes will continue to control the local planning agenda.",

Where to eat out for under \u00a315</strong></p> <p><strong> Willows Wine Bar, 81 Denmark Hill, Camberwell, SE5, Tel: 020-7701 0188</strong> <br>Mention of the words \"wine bar\" may dredge up uncomfortable memories of harooshing City wide boys, knocking back the vino after a hard day's wheeler-dealing. Thankfully, Willows is an altogether mellower sort of place, with heavy wooden tables and long glass windows lending a proto-Parisian air. The wine is the thing, but devoted guzzlers need a solid as well as liquid diet. Starters are around the \u00a34 mark, and main dishes stretch from about \u00a37 to \u00a310.95. The menu is hardly radical, but the food itself - penne with salmon, pine nuts and a mushroom sauce; warm goat's cheese salad, potato skins with cheese and salsa; pitta with humus and taramasalata - is pretty spot on. More than enough to soak up the Chardonnay. </p> <p>\u0095 <strong> Quick bites... Where to eat out in 15 minutes </strong></p> <p><strong> 4 Grove Lane, Camberwell, London, SE5, Tel: 020-7701 4944</strong> <br>Tucked snugly off the main road, away from Camberwell's fried chicken joints and greasy spoons, 4 Grove Lane is a sandwich shop plying the sort of ciabatta rolls that come plumply stuffed like hamsters' cheeks. At 6.30pm, the place is magicked, Bugsy Malone-style, into a pizzeria. May not be authentic enough to please pizza snobs, but the bases are whippet-thin, and the toppings toothsome, all sinewy cheese and crisp, buckled edges. The menu is a glorious inventory of Mediterranean feelgood goodies: feta, olives, anchovies and the like. And the staff are snake-hipped funksters who serve with a swagger. </p> <p>\u0095 <strong>On the menu: Nagiri Bocho </strong> </p> <p><strong>Sounds delicious. What is it?</strong> You can't eat it. You can't smell it. You can't hear it. </p> <p><strong> Cut it out. What can I do with it?</strong> Cut it out. Literally. </p> <p><strong> Cut to the quick? </strong> Exactly. It's a knife. </p> <p><strong> Any old knife?</strong> A Japanese knife that is used by the kitchen samurai in that country for cutting vegetables. </p> <p><strong> What's so special about a nagiri bocho?</strong> Western knives are forged from steel. Japanese knives are made by forge-welding steel and iron together to give strength without brittleness and long-lasting sharpness. </p> <p><strong> I'll rush out and get one right away.</strong>Don't get a deba bocho (for poultry and fish), unagisaki bocho (eel), or a sashimi bocho by mistake. </p> <p>\u0095 <strong> On the net: </strong><a href=\"http://www.vegweb.com\">www.vegweb.com</a></p> <p> Meat-eaters might be feeling a little edgy at the moment, so now might very well be the time to start improving your vegetarian culinary know-how - and vegweb gives you a wealth of meat-free recipes at your fingertips. True, I'm not too sure about the Congo Tofu, or even the Pina Colada Tofu Shake, but the Bean and Pumpkin Curry has a certain allure. Vegweb has a dozen recipes for French toast, and a culinary dictionary telling us all about the nutritional merits of dandelions (high in iron and vitamin A, apparently) and explaining precisely what spatzles are (noodles, as if you didn't know). And yes, fret not, there's even a recipe for vegan bacon. </p> <p>\u0095 <strong>Just out: Duchy Originals Organic Creamy Mature Stilton </strong></p> <p><strong>Form: </strong> chunky wedge; good creamy colour; decent bluing; a little wet </p> <p><strong> Flavour:</strong> lovely texture; very strong; blue predominates; verges on ammoniac; creaminess lost completely. </p> <p><strong> Verdict:</strong> \"Made with the milk from the rare breed of shorthorn cows.\" Ah, yes, well. The milk may be great, and the cheese, potentially, is very good (though not unpasteurised, as one might wish), but the marketing rather does for it.

      "bodyText": "\u0095 Cheapskate... Where to eat out for under \u00a315 Willows Wine Bar, 81 Denmark Hill, Camberwell, SE5, Tel: 020-7701 0188 Mention of the words \"wine bar\" may dredge up uncomfortable memories of harooshing City wide boys, knocking back the vino after a hard day's wheeler-dealing. Thankfully, Willows is an altogether mellower sort of place, with heavy wooden tables and long glass windows lending a proto-Parisian air. The wine is the thing, but devoted guzzlers need a solid as well as liquid diet. Starters are around the \u00a34 mark, and main dishes stretch from about \u00a37 to \u00a310.95. The menu is hardly radical, but the food itself - penne with salmon, pine nuts and a mushroom sauce; warm goat's cheese salad, potato skins with cheese and salsa; pitta with humus and taramasalata - is pretty spot on. More than enough to soak up the Chardonnay. \u0095 Quick bites... Where to eat out in 15 minutes 4 Grove Lane, Camberwell, London, SE5, Tel: 020-7701 4944 Tucked snugly off the main road, away from Camberwell's fried chicken joints and greasy spoons, 4 Grove Lane is a sandwich shop plying the sort of ciabatta rolls that come plumply stuffed like hamsters' cheeks. At 6.30pm, the place is magicked, Bugsy Malone-style, into a pizzeria. May not be authentic enough to please pizza snobs, but the bases are whippet-thin, and the toppings toothsome, all sinewy cheese and crisp, buckled edges. The menu is a glorious inventory of Mediterranean feelgood goodies: feta, olives, anchovies and the like. And the staff are snake-hipped funksters who serve with a swagger. \u0095 On the menu: Nagiri Bocho Sounds delicious. What is it? You can't eat it. You can't smell it. You can't hear it. Cut it out. What can I do with it? Cut it out. Literally. Cut to the quick? Exactly. It's a knife. Any old knife? A Japanese knife that is used by the kitchen samurai in that country for cutting vegetables. What's so special about a nagiri bocho? Western knives are forged from steel. Japanese knives are made by forge-welding steel and iron together to give strength without brittleness and long-lasting sharpness. I'll rush out and get one right away.Don't get a deba bocho (for poultry and fish), unagisaki bocho (eel), or a sashimi bocho by mistake. \u0095 On the net: www.vegweb.com Meat-eaters might be feeling a little edgy at the moment, so now might very well be the time to start improving your vegetarian culinary know-how - and vegweb gives you a wealth of meat-free recipes at your fingertips. True, I'm not too sure about the Congo Tofu, or even the Pina Colada Tofu Shake, but the Bean and Pumpkin Curry has a certain allure. Vegweb has a dozen recipes for French toast, and a culinary dictionary telling us all about the nutritional merits of dandelions (high in iron and vitamin A, apparently) and explaining precisely what spatzles are (noodles, as if you didn't know). And yes, fret not, there's even a recipe for vegan bacon. \u0095 Just out: Duchy Originals Organic Creamy Mature Stilton Form: chunky wedge; good creamy colour; decent bluing; a little wet Flavour: lovely texture; very strong; blue predominates; verges on ammoniac; creaminess lost completely. Verdict: \"Made with the milk from the rare breed of shorthorn cows.\" Ah, yes, well. The milk may be great, and the cheese, potentially, is very good (though not unpasteurised, as one might wish), but the marketing rather does for it. Classy packaging, as ever, but plastic wrap around the cheese itself means the cheese can't breathe properly, so it tastes more acidic and pungent than it should. Cost: \u00a311.56 per kg or \u00a32.96 for 256g. \u0095 The taste test: dark chocolate Or plain, as we might call it. The kind that sorts out chocoholics from mere choccieluvvies. We're looking for a refinement-and-purity high, so those with less than 65% cocoa solids got relegated to the bin (after tasting).

These shrubs can, indeed, be reduced in size without their objecting. But let's take a look at them in greater detail. After all, they may prove more of a disappointment than an asset. </p> <p>The main appeal of pyracanthas is their showy crops of orange or yellow berries in the autumn. White blossom in spring is a pleasant extra. When I see pyracanthas at their best, I wonder why I don't grow any. But, considered year-round, I find them a bit sordid. They are evergreen, but their leaves are without character and their way of growing has little attraction - a point that is of small importance once they have to be clipped back, generally to a wall, on a regular basis. But, in the course of time, clipping back makes them a lumpy feature, and is also apt to reduce their berry production. They are tolerant of shade, which is an advantage, but our huge one used to get scab on its fruit. I was greatly relieved when we got rid of it, but don't let me put you off. If you have the space, a free-standing pyracantha that needs no pruning can look splendid. They are not 100% hardy, but with global warming I suppose it will be of less notice. </p> <p>When viburnum was mentioned, I imagine the writer had the ubiquitous Viburnum tinus in mind, popularly known as laurustinus. This is an incredibly generous shrub, often flowering abundantly both in autumn and spring; sometimes in winter, too, if that is mild. The evergreen foliage is sombre but pleasing. If you need to clip it to fit into a space, do this in spring when it has finished flowering. </p> <p>'Eve Price' is a popular clone, reasonably dwarf and very pink in the bud, though the flowers are always white. 'Gwenllian' is another good one, larger growing but again a good pink in the bud. It also fruits freely, these being blue. The fruits are even more conspicuous in V. davidii, which is a lower-growing shrub, almost a ground-coverer (you can cut it back when it gets too big). Its leathery leaves with deeply grooved parallel veining are its main point. Most nurseries sell it unsexed but some do specify and it is certainly worth having a male among your females, the fruit being a definite bonus. This is what I should describe as a thoroughly worthy, good-tempered shrub, but if, after many years, you become bored with it, you have my sympathy. An end to the relationship is far cheaper and less messy than divorce. I admired Garrya elliptica for many years, and it thrived on a sunless wall. You can cut it back quite severely in spring and it will flower abundantly the next winter on its young shoots. January is its season and its long, grey-green catkins make a great display (if not frosted) for a few weeks. But for the rest of the year it is a big yawn, with leathery, evergreen foliage of no character. Even in January you may feel that there are enough grey skies without a garrya to emphasise them. </p> <p>What you really should be growing, to flower from late February well into April, is Daphne odora, generally marketed in the 'Aureomarginata' clone. It is highly lime-tolerant. Its evergreen leaves are generally a rather sickly yellowish-green colour, but don't let that worry you, because its flowering is prodigious - clusters of blossom that are rosy purple on the outside, near-white within - and the powerful, airborne scent is incredible. It's great for picking, too. The shrub is only 0.5m high, as a rule, but more spreading. In southern counties, it will flower well in shade, but in the north, even in sunshine, it may not flower at all. </p> <p>An evergreen ceanothus is such an exciting feature that it should not be passed over without an effort. Generally, it will flower in May-June, though some species are earlier, and its blossom, in globe-shaped pouffes, is genuinely blue (in the best kinds) and totally different from anything else you can flower at that time. Hardiness is a little dubious, but it is an admirable wall shrub on any reasonably sunny aspect (east, south, west). It can (should, indeed) be kept into the wall, first by tying in growths to cover the area, then on a regular basis by clipping it over immediately after flowering. Branches that jut inconveniently forwards should be removed but anticipate later trouble and do this regularly. Ceanothus of this kind does not enjoy being pruned into old wood. </p> <p>I would choose a small and neat-leaved variety such as 'Puget Blue' or 'Cynthia Postan'. These really are show-stoppers, and you'll have the public gawping over your gate in unbelieving admiration. Sudden death is only to be expected, sooner or later, in such a paragon, but don't be put off by that. Plant another. And this is the time to be planting, as it is for all slightly dubiously hardy shrubs. </p> <p>This type of ceanothus is not to be confused with the much hardier, deciduous, summer- flowering kinds, which are of looser growth and less pure or intense colouring. They are a lot easier to manage - 'Gloire de Versailles' is the best known of them - but less rewarding. Such is life</p>",

      "body": "<p>Suppose you were a prisoner in the \"hell hole\" - to use the prison director general's description - of Winson Green, Birmingham, in 1998. How would you feel about the system today? In 1998 the chief inspector of prisons produced one of his most scathing reports. Similar reports in that year were filed on Wandsworth, Wormwood Scrubs and Feltham, which led to taskforces and action plans that earned the respect of the chief inspector. But at Winson Green, a bad prison has got even worse, as yesterday's report makes abundantly clear.</p> <p>It is no longer just failing but \"sick\". The report documents a catalogue of appalling conditions: filth, overcrowding, the least amount of association of any prison (less than an hour a day) and low numbers in education and work, with half the prison idle every day. One mentally ill prisoner had not washed or changed his clothes for weeks. Now think of the 730 days spent by an inmate in the two years between the chief inspector's visits. Is it any wonder prisons generate such anger among their inmates?</p> <p>Why is it the chief inspector uncovers conditions that area managers have failed to expose? Lord Laming was supposed to have answered this question, but failed lamentably. Who was it who sent in management consultants who proposed cuts - in already the cheapest prison - of almost \u00a31m?

      "bodyText": "Suppose you were a prisoner in the \"hell hole\" - to use the prison director general's description - of Winson Green, Birmingham, in 1998. How would you feel about the system today? In 1998 the chief inspector of prisons produced one of his most scathing reports. Similar reports in that year were filed on Wandsworth, Wormwood Scrubs and Feltham, which led to taskforces and action plans that earned the respect of the chief inspector. But at Winson Green, a bad prison has got even worse, as yesterday's report makes abundantly clear. It is no longer just failing but \"sick\". The report documents a catalogue of appalling conditions: filth, overcrowding, the least amount of association of any prison (less than an hour a day) and low numbers in education and work, with half the prison idle every day. One mentally ill prisoner had not washed or changed his clothes for weeks. Now think of the 730 days spent by an inmate in the two years between the chief inspector's visits. Is it any wonder prisons generate such anger among their inmates? Why is it the chief inspector uncovers conditions that area managers have failed to expose? Lord Laming was supposed to have answered this question, but failed lamentably. Who was it who sent in management consultants who proposed cuts - in already the cheapest prison - of almost \u00a31m? And why have ministers failed to resolve the conflict between the chief inspector and director general? Both agree on the appalling conditions, but disagree about solutions. The inspector wants identified individuals to be responsible for conditions which different categories of inmates face. Paul Boateng, the prison minister, is notorious for his knee-jerk condemnations of public service failings. Why is he not facing the sack? There can be no excuse for his failure to resolve the dispute - or his failure to insist on the chief inspector's reappointment. The protection of prisoners makes this imperative.

The removal of the Apaches, tanks, armoured cars and their crews had been agreed between Nato and the Clinton administration in December as part of a six-monthly review. But many strategists in the Bush administration favour a switch from a \"presence mission\" in Bosnia - large enough to control any outbreak in hostilities - to a \"deterrence mission\" - a much smaller presence made up mainly of police with military forces ready to move in in the event of trouble. Such a switch has been discussed for some time by Nato planners, but many in the Bush team, including the national security advisor, Condoleezza Rice, want it to take place almost immediately. \"For the US to float this idea that we can now pull out is just wrong,\" said Ivo Daalder, an expert on Nato and the Balkans at the Brookings Institution. \"These problems in Presevo [in Serbia] and in Macedonia are in part because people there don't believe the US is going to stay.

      "body": "<p>Extrapolating trends from fashion shows is an imprecise science. Sometimes it works: if nine out of 10 designers show miniskirts, we can safely assume that miniskirts are In. At other times, however, it can feel like trying to read social trends from soap operas: \"bullying is the new bulimia\", you might deduce, or \"murder is so last season\". In real life, it doesn't work like that. This season has no pithy, wipe-the-slate-clean New Look. There are some items that are likely to translate on to the high street - boots to just over the knee, for instance - but which will not deliver a new image singlehandedly. </p> <p>That's not to say it's been a dull week. Far from it: Paris has been full of ideas. But these shows have not been about sudden, sweeping trends; rather they have been about the more gradual shifts in fashion, the ones that mould and shape your wardrobe over seasons. For instance, reading between the headline pieces, it becomes clear that one of the major shifts of the past year has been to a new dressing-up formula: the pretty, draped blouse in a luxurious fabric, worn with trousers either skintight or straight. </p> <p>As a \"modern evening\" look, this is taking over from the beaded-skirt-and-cashmere-cardigan combination that swept the board a few years ago. It is a way of dealing with increasingly relaxed sartorial rules. As Celine designer Michael Kors put it this week: \"The time of day is disappearing.\" </p> <p>At Chloe, Stella McCartney has a sure eye for outfits that are a little too chichi and glossy for day but not quite proper enough for night - and therefore always look cool. Using the motifs of Paris fashion but with a light touch, she added pearls as dangling epaulettes on off-the-shoulder blouses, worn with slouchy trousers. </p> <p>Emanuel Ungaro went a similar route. This label has bounced back from naffness, bringing up to date the prettiness with which it has always been associated: butterfly appliqu\u00e9s are beautiful and feminine but always asym metrically placed, always a little outsized, so look modern rather than prissy. The dresses were gorgeous - black silk chiffon, bare at one shoulder, bias-cut to the knee, decorated with branches and buds in ivory and scarlet velvet - but for more relaxed glamour there was a red silk chiffon blouse with silk crepe trousers, or a black asymmetric top with softly tailored jade silk trousers. </p> <p>Valentino is never a designer who pays attention to trends, so this was a perfect season for him. His customers know what suits them and are not about to be distracted by bumblebee stripes or distressed fabrics, however fashionable they might be. The eveningwear inspires awe as to these women's lifestyles (to what event exactly would one wear a black tulle sequined dress coat with double layer in lace?) and the daywear is dressier than most designers' evening gowns. Mink-trimmed ivory lace blouses with satin trousers gave a moneyed look to the blouse-and-trouser idea. </p> <p>Dries van Noten's was a strong collection: clean-lined, light, wearable, never frumpy. Colour combinations centred on white with peach, cream with sky blue. Elegant trousers and printed silks were teamed with pale, luxurious boots and coats. At Celine, lingerie-esque garments were worn with outdoorsy fabrics: a lace-trim satin camisole with tight jeans, a tartan jacket, fur collar and tiny, shiny handbag. The look was Lumberjack Luxe: Kors' favourite all-American staples of denim, knits and leather given an uptown gloss. </p> <p>At Yves Saint Laurent, Tom Ford combined a diplomatic reverence for the YSL heritage with his own keen eye for what works now. Using a moody black and purple palette, he took elements from Saint Laurent's bohemian-ethnic era but made them sleek rather than folky. </p> <p>Sculptured, elegant tailoring abounded this week. Jackets featured curving hems, cutaway at the front to make the silhouette barer. Coats were streamlined and striking, with funnel necklines and sleek, straight shapes: high-necked and military at Vuitton, cosy in cream at Dries van Noten and Chloe. There were excellent dresses, from Dries van Noten's 30s print silks, which wrap around the neck like a silk scarf, to Chloe's asymmetric, curvy lacquered satin.

      "bodyText": "Extrapolating trends from fashion shows is an imprecise science. Sometimes it works: if nine out of 10 designers show miniskirts, we can safely assume that miniskirts are In. At other times, however, it can feel like trying to read social trends from soap operas: \"bullying is the new bulimia\", you might deduce, or \"murder is so last season\". In real life, it doesn't work like that. This season has no pithy, wipe-the-slate-clean New Look. There are some items that are likely to translate on to the high street - boots to just over the knee, for instance - but which will not deliver a new image singlehandedly. That's not to say it's been a dull week. Far from it: Paris has been full of ideas. But these shows have not been about sudden, sweeping trends; rather they have been about the more gradual shifts in fashion, the ones that mould and shape your wardrobe over seasons. For instance, reading between the headline pieces, it becomes clear that one of the major shifts of the past year has been to a new dressing-up formula: the pretty, draped blouse in a luxurious fabric, worn with trousers either skintight or straight. As a \"modern evening\" look, this is taking over from the beaded-skirt-and-cashmere-cardigan combination that swept the board a few years ago. It is a way of dealing with increasingly relaxed sartorial rules. As Celine designer Michael Kors put it this week: \"The time of day is disappearing.\" At Chloe, Stella McCartney has a sure eye for outfits that are a little too chichi and glossy for day but not quite proper enough for night - and therefore always look cool. Using the motifs of Paris fashion but with a light touch, she added pearls as dangling epaulettes on off-the-shoulder blouses, worn with slouchy trousers. Emanuel Ungaro went a similar route. This label has bounced back from naffness, bringing up to date the prettiness with which it has always been associated: butterfly appliqu\u00e9s are beautiful and feminine but always asym metrically placed, always a little outsized, so look modern rather than prissy. The dresses were gorgeous - black silk chiffon, bare at one shoulder, bias-cut to the knee, decorated with branches and buds in ivory and scarlet velvet - but for more relaxed glamour there was a red silk chiffon blouse with silk crepe trousers, or a black asymmetric top with softly tailored jade silk trousers. Valentino is never a designer who pays attention to trends, so this was a perfect season for him. His customers know what suits them and are not about to be distracted by bumblebee stripes or distressed fabrics, however fashionable they might be. The eveningwear inspires awe as to these women's lifestyles (to what event exactly would one wear a black tulle sequined dress coat with double layer in lace?) and the daywear is dressier than most designers' evening gowns. Mink-trimmed ivory lace blouses with satin trousers gave a moneyed look to the blouse-and-trouser idea. Dries van Noten's was a strong collection: clean-lined, light, wearable, never frumpy. Colour combinations centred on white with peach, cream with sky blue. Elegant trousers and printed silks were teamed with pale, luxurious boots and coats. At Celine, lingerie-esque garments were worn with outdoorsy fabrics: a lace-trim satin camisole with tight jeans, a tartan jacket, fur collar and tiny, shiny handbag. The look was Lumberjack Luxe: Kors' favourite all-American staples of denim, knits and leather given an uptown gloss. At Yves Saint Laurent, Tom Ford combined a diplomatic reverence for the YSL heritage with his own keen eye for what works now. Using a moody black and purple palette, he took elements from Saint Laurent's bohemian-ethnic era but made them sleek rather than folky. Sculptured, elegant tailoring abounded this week. Jackets featured curving hems, cutaway at the front to make the silhouette barer. Coats were streamlined and striking, with funnel necklines and sleek, straight shapes: high-necked and military at Vuitton, cosy in cream at Dries van Noten and Chloe. There were excellent dresses, from Dries van Noten's 30s print silks, which wrap around the neck like a silk scarf, to Chloe's asymmetric, curvy lacquered satin. Asymmetry was everywhere, in fact: knee-length has been usurped by knee-length with a bit trailing down the calf.

      "body": "<p>The sudden outburst of fighting by Albanian gunmen near Macedonia's second city, Tetovo, has caught Balkan politicians by surprise, not least the main Albanian political leaders in Macedonia and nearby Kosovo.</p> <p>Macedonia has until now been the most peaceful of the former Yugoslav republics which became independent in the early 1990s. It has an Albanian minority of 22.9%, according to a 1994 census, though the true current figure could be up to one-third. The Macedonian majority is Slav.</p> <p>Since Macedonia's independence, Albanian political demands have largely centred on language and cultural rights. They want the Macedonian constitution to be changed to drop the preamble that Macedonia is \"the national state of the Macedonian people\" and recognise that it is multiracial, with equal rights for all peoples, including Albanians, Turks, and Roma.</p> <p>Unusually for a Balkan state, Macedonia has a bi-ethnic coalition government. In an act of ethnic tolerance and political wisdom, the more radical of the two Albanian political parties, the Democratic Party of Albanians (DPA), was invited into government after the 1998 election. It has engineered some key changes. The Macedonian government has agreed to recognise the private Albanian-language EU-funded university in Tetovo, which has a large Albanian majority. An Albanian was appointed to be chief of police for the first time in Tetovo.</p> <p>All this makes the current crisis doubly unexpected. It suggests that the fighting is the work of a handful of marginal men. It is not part of a general upsurge in favour of changing Balkan borders and creating a so-called greater Albania. The Albanian government is as alarmed as western politicians and Ilir Meta, its prime minister, yesterday condemned the gunmen and urged restraint.</p> <p>Although ethnic feelings are close to the surface in Macedonia, where Albanians and Macedonians tend to lead separate lives, this does not mean that every Albanian wants independence or secession, or to join Kosovo or Albania.</p> <p>The fighting is not connected to the trouble in the Presevo valley of southern Serbia, where Albanian gunmen took control of the buffer zone imposed when Nato forced Yugoslav troops to leave Kosovo in 1999. \"Unlike the commanders in Presevo, who have come forward and are well known, no one here is sure who the commander of the extremists in Macedonia is,\" an editor at Koha Ditore, a leading Albanian newspaper in Pristina said.</p> <p>One of their political masterminds is thought to be Emrush Xhemaili, the leader of the People's Movement of Kosovo (LPK). The LPK is a tiny party which won less than 1% of the vote in last autumn's elections in Kosovo. Its motive in supporting the fighting in Macedonia could be a mistaken belief that it will win more backing than at the ballot box.</p> <p>The US Balkans envoy, James Pardew, met Mr Xhemaili on Wednesday to warn him not to support the gunmen. \"All of these actions outside of Kosovo coming from Kosovo undermine the international community, and we're urging these leaders to be leaders, to express within the local community how much damage this is causing,\" Mr Pardew said. \"We were very direct with Mr Xhemaili and the LPK that people should be focused internally on Kosovo.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The sudden outburst of fighting by Albanian gunmen near Macedonia's second city, Tetovo, has caught Balkan politicians by surprise, not least the main Albanian political leaders in Macedonia and nearby Kosovo. Macedonia has until now been the most peaceful of the former Yugoslav republics which became independent in the early 1990s. It has an Albanian minority of 22.9%, according to a 1994 census, though the true current figure could be up to one-third. The Macedonian majority is Slav. Since Macedonia's independence, Albanian political demands have largely centred on language and cultural rights. They want the Macedonian constitution to be changed to drop the preamble that Macedonia is \"the national state of the Macedonian people\" and recognise that it is multiracial, with equal rights for all peoples, including Albanians, Turks, and Roma. Unusually for a Balkan state, Macedonia has a bi-ethnic coalition government. In an act of ethnic tolerance and political wisdom, the more radical of the two Albanian political parties, the Democratic Party of Albanians (DPA), was invited into government after the 1998 election. It has engineered some key changes. The Macedonian government has agreed to recognise the private Albanian-language EU-funded university in Tetovo, which has a large Albanian majority. An Albanian was appointed to be chief of police for the first time in Tetovo. All this makes the current crisis doubly unexpected. It suggests that the fighting is the work of a handful of marginal men. It is not part of a general upsurge in favour of changing Balkan borders and creating a so-called greater Albania. The Albanian government is as alarmed as western politicians and Ilir Meta, its prime minister, yesterday condemned the gunmen and urged restraint. Although ethnic feelings are close to the surface in Macedonia, where Albanians and Macedonians tend to lead separate lives, this does not mean that every Albanian wants independence or secession, or to join Kosovo or Albania. The fighting is not connected to the trouble in the Presevo valley of southern Serbia, where Albanian gunmen took control of the buffer zone imposed when Nato forced Yugoslav troops to leave Kosovo in 1999. \"Unlike the commanders in Presevo, who have come forward and are well known, no one here is sure who the commander of the extremists in Macedonia is,\" an editor at Koha Ditore, a leading Albanian newspaper in Pristina said. One of their political masterminds is thought to be Emrush Xhemaili, the leader of the People's Movement of Kosovo (LPK). The LPK is a tiny party which won less than 1% of the vote in last autumn's elections in Kosovo. Its motive in supporting the fighting in Macedonia could be a mistaken belief that it will win more backing than at the ballot box. The US Balkans envoy, James Pardew, met Mr Xhemaili on Wednesday to warn him not to support the gunmen. \"All of these actions outside of Kosovo coming from Kosovo undermine the international community, and we're urging these leaders to be leaders, to express within the local community how much damage this is causing,\" Mr Pardew said. \"We were very direct with Mr Xhemaili and the LPK that people should be focused internally on Kosovo.\"",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>There is little doubt that the Bush administration wants to get out of the Balkans, first from Bosnia and then from Kosovo. That is why this week's not very widely reported announcement that the administration is planning to pull out some tanks and around 750 troops from Bosnia has to be taken seriously.</p> <p>It is the first step in fulfilling a wish that many Republicans have shared ever since Bill Clinton committed the US in the region as part of the Dayton accords. It will be followed by others, and together they will present a major challenge for Europe.</p> <p>To understand why the US wants out, it is important to recognise the depth of contempt among Republicans for the Clinton administration's Balkans policy. The Republicans are sceptical about the existence of a clear US interest in the region and are downright angry about what they see as the absence of an obvious US aim in maintaining some 9,000 US troops there for peacekeeping duties that could continue for many years.</p> <p>As modern Republicans tend to, they also believe their own rhetoric, which claims that the US is carrying the military weight of a policy that is rightfully Europe's responsibility. That 85% of the Nato forces in Kosovo are European is a fact not often mentioned, or even acknowledged, in the US.</p> <p>During the election campaign, George Bush was careful not to say outright that he would bring the boys home from the Balkans. However, he repeatedly attacked the over-commitment of US troops in local conflicts, and he and his advisers regularly denounced the idea of using US troops for what they called \"nation-building\".</p> <p>One adviser, Condoleezza Rice, now the White House national security adviser, actually went on the record during the campaign to say the troops should and would come out.</p> <p>Some Europeans have convinced themselves that they have succeeded in dissuading the administration from such a pull out. But they are wrong. The views expressed by Rice on the campaign trail were not an aberration; they were an unguarded reflection of the Bush camp's true views.</p> <p>They are widely shared, including by vice president Dick Cheney and defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld. The signs point overwhelmingly to a will to withdraw. Anyone who listened to Rumsfeld in his press conference in Washington last week with Lord Robertson, the Nato secretary general, would have heard a man who plainly sees the Balkans as nothing but trouble.</p> <p>When he took over at the Pentagon two months ago, the new defence secretary circulated his subordinates with a document entitled Rumsfeld's Rules, a collection of aphorisms and commonplaces that Rumsfeld has collected over the years. And there, on page one of Rumsfeld's Rules is the observation that sums up post-Vietnam US defence thinking: \"It is easier to get into something than to get out of it\".</p> <p>In the Balkans, the Bush administration believes that Clinton has dumped them in a situation that they want to get out of. As Rumsfeld's rule reminds us, however, that is easy to say and hard to do. But that in turn is why this week's latest Bosnia pullout move is significant and why further reports in the US yesterday, that the administration has decided to reduce its Bosnia troop commitment from the present 4,400 to under 1,000 within months, are also credible.</p> <p>For the moment, these planned withdrawals do not affect Kosovo. But there are signs of a basic lack of US will there, too. Rumsfeld has conspicuously not used the sorts of words that the secretary of state Colin Powell has used - like \"stay the course\" - and he has prevented US troops from becoming too involved in the current problems on the Kosovo-Serbia-Macedonia borders. Every day of fierce fighting there increases Washington's resolve not to stick around.</p> <p>Nowadays the official US position is that it will not make a precipitous withdrawal - hardly the most ringing declaration of solidarity that one has ever heard.</p> <p>It is by no means the case that even Powell is as committed to the continuing US presence as he has been interpreted as being.

      "bodyText": "There is little doubt that the Bush administration wants to get out of the Balkans, first from Bosnia and then from Kosovo. That is why this week's not very widely reported announcement that the administration is planning to pull out some tanks and around 750 troops from Bosnia has to be taken seriously. It is the first step in fulfilling a wish that many Republicans have shared ever since Bill Clinton committed the US in the region as part of the Dayton accords. It will be followed by others, and together they will present a major challenge for Europe. To understand why the US wants out, it is important to recognise the depth of contempt among Republicans for the Clinton administration's Balkans policy. The Republicans are sceptical about the existence of a clear US interest in the region and are downright angry about what they see as the absence of an obvious US aim in maintaining some 9,000 US troops there for peacekeeping duties that could continue for many years. As modern Republicans tend to, they also believe their own rhetoric, which claims that the US is carrying the military weight of a policy that is rightfully Europe's responsibility. That 85% of the Nato forces in Kosovo are European is a fact not often mentioned, or even acknowledged, in the US. During the election campaign, George Bush was careful not to say outright that he would bring the boys home from the Balkans. However, he repeatedly attacked the over-commitment of US troops in local conflicts, and he and his advisers regularly denounced the idea of using US troops for what they called \"nation-building\". One adviser, Condoleezza Rice, now the White House national security adviser, actually went on the record during the campaign to say the troops should and would come out. Some Europeans have convinced themselves that they have succeeded in dissuading the administration from such a pull out. But they are wrong. The views expressed by Rice on the campaign trail were not an aberration; they were an unguarded reflection of the Bush camp's true views. They are widely shared, including by vice president Dick Cheney and defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld. The signs point overwhelmingly to a will to withdraw. Anyone who listened to Rumsfeld in his press conference in Washington last week with Lord Robertson, the Nato secretary general, would have heard a man who plainly sees the Balkans as nothing but trouble. When he took over at the Pentagon two months ago, the new defence secretary circulated his subordinates with a document entitled Rumsfeld's Rules, a collection of aphorisms and commonplaces that Rumsfeld has collected over the years. And there, on page one of Rumsfeld's Rules is the observation that sums up post-Vietnam US defence thinking: \"It is easier to get into something than to get out of it\". In the Balkans, the Bush administration believes that Clinton has dumped them in a situation that they want to get out of. As Rumsfeld's rule reminds us, however, that is easy to say and hard to do. But that in turn is why this week's latest Bosnia pullout move is significant and why further reports in the US yesterday, that the administration has decided to reduce its Bosnia troop commitment from the present 4,400 to under 1,000 within months, are also credible. For the moment, these planned withdrawals do not affect Kosovo. But there are signs of a basic lack of US will there, too. Rumsfeld has conspicuously not used the sorts of words that the secretary of state Colin Powell has used - like \"stay the course\" - and he has prevented US troops from becoming too involved in the current problems on the Kosovo-Serbia-Macedonia borders. Every day of fierce fighting there increases Washington's resolve not to stick around. Nowadays the official US position is that it will not make a precipitous withdrawal - hardly the most ringing declaration of solidarity that one has ever heard. It is by no means the case that even Powell is as committed to the continuing US presence as he has been interpreted as being. Anyone who has read Powell's memoirs will remember the blistering indictments of \"the pseudopolicy of establishing a US 'presence' without a defined mission in trouble spots\", as he described the Clinton administration's Bosnia policy. It was Powell's reluctance to get involved in Bosnia that sparked Madeleine Albright's angry comment to him: \"What's the point of having this superb military that you're always talking about if we can't use it?\" If the situation on the Macedonian border continues to deteriorate, Washington will come under pressure to increase its involvement. The signs are that its response will be the exact opposite. This administration does not seek an extended role in Europe. Its concerns are in the Middle East and in Asia. Not having wanted to be in the Balkans in the first place, the Bush administration may even welcome the latest crisis in Macedonia as a catalyst in the process of accelerated withdrawal that began this week. As another of Rumsfeld's Rules puts it: \"If in doubt - don't.\" Email martin.kettle@theguardian.com Related special reports George W Bush's America Bush pulls out troops from Balkans Balkans crisis Other articles More articles by Martin Kettle Useful links The Washington Post George W Bush official site The White House Capitol Steps political satire",

      "body": "<p>Enough of this nonsense, says number 10 with its usual robustness: elections will go ahead on May 3 as planned, despite foot and mouth. Some of the neighbours are not so sure. As we reported yesterday, Gordon Brown, Labour's chief election strategist, thinks the decision is on a knife edge. It is right that this tension is there. There are solid arguments both for going ahead and for postponing - and time for the picture to change before the final decision day, 10 days from now. </p> <p>The immediate issue is what to do about the local elections due to take place on the traditional date, the first Thursday in May. Few governments have departed from that, except in wartime; the most recent was the Conservatives in 1986, scrapping the elections to the doomed GLC. Only in very exceptional circumstances, when substantial numbers are likely to be effectively disenfranchised, should the usual rules be rescinded. There are parts of the countryside where that point is approaching, though the problems are much less formidable than they once would have been. Much canvassing is by telephone. The right to vote by post has been widely extended. Even in local contests, media coverage is more likely to sway the outcome than traditional doorstep canvassing. Yet some areas feel besieged. People are holding back from making all but the most necessary journeys - and resent those who make them. How much of the country is in this psychological state is hard to measure. But if the blight continues to spread in these next 10 days, the case for postponement will grow. </p> <p>But May 3 is also the almost unchallenged date for the general election. Here the date is not fixed. It will happen when Tony Blair thinks it suits his party advantage. The Tories fear May 3. They now especially fear that Labour may go ahead on the basis that the Tories would lose more from having the election during the outbreak than Labour would. Mr Hague, who does not want to seem chicken, has held back from demanding postponement, but his cheerleader newspapers are doing it for him, asserting that to ask the nation to make its choice in conditions like these would be fundamentally indecent and undemocratic. The Telegraph is even trying to tag it \"the carcass election\". It is argued in terms of principle, but here too the case is all about party advantage. </p> <p>One might have hoped that the new electoral commission would have some part in holding the ring. In fact it is given no right to dispute the prime minister's choice of date. The most it has done so far is to signal its likely concern should voters be effectively disenfranchised. Though powerless to stop that happening, it would have the right to declare in its post-election report that this had occurred and that the election, to this extent, had fallen below desirable levels of fairness. (What joy that judgment would bring to governments like Zimbabwe's!) </p> <p>There is, too, a further judge of how the government handles this issue: the electorate. If the sense develops in rural Britain that this government has for party advantage cheated the rural voter and tilted the balance still further towards the urban majority, Labour's vote in its 180 rural or semi-rural seats is likely to suffer. Some of its MPs fear this already. So whatever the hardline rulings, these matters are not yet settled. As things stand today, it is probably right to press on with the local elections - which would clearly open the way for a May 3 general election too. But issues of taste and propriety will also come in to the final balance. Though harder to quantify, they are a central part of politics too.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Enough of this nonsense, says number 10 with its usual robustness: elections will go ahead on May 3 as planned, despite foot and mouth. Some of the neighbours are not so sure. As we reported yesterday, Gordon Brown, Labour's chief election strategist, thinks the decision is on a knife edge. It is right that this tension is there. There are solid arguments both for going ahead and for postponing - and time for the picture to change before the final decision day, 10 days from now. The immediate issue is what to do about the local elections due to take place on the traditional date, the first Thursday in May. Few governments have departed from that, except in wartime; the most recent was the Conservatives in 1986, scrapping the elections to the doomed GLC. Only in very exceptional circumstances, when substantial numbers are likely to be effectively disenfranchised, should the usual rules be rescinded. There are parts of the countryside where that point is approaching, though the problems are much less formidable than they once would have been. Much canvassing is by telephone. The right to vote by post has been widely extended. Even in local contests, media coverage is more likely to sway the outcome than traditional doorstep canvassing. Yet some areas feel besieged. People are holding back from making all but the most necessary journeys - and resent those who make them. How much of the country is in this psychological state is hard to measure. But if the blight continues to spread in these next 10 days, the case for postponement will grow. But May 3 is also the almost unchallenged date for the general election. Here the date is not fixed. It will happen when Tony Blair thinks it suits his party advantage. The Tories fear May 3. They now especially fear that Labour may go ahead on the basis that the Tories would lose more from having the election during the outbreak than Labour would. Mr Hague, who does not want to seem chicken, has held back from demanding postponement, but his cheerleader newspapers are doing it for him, asserting that to ask the nation to make its choice in conditions like these would be fundamentally indecent and undemocratic. The Telegraph is even trying to tag it \"the carcass election\". It is argued in terms of principle, but here too the case is all about party advantage. One might have hoped that the new electoral commission would have some part in holding the ring. In fact it is given no right to dispute the prime minister's choice of date. The most it has done so far is to signal its likely concern should voters be effectively disenfranchised. Though powerless to stop that happening, it would have the right to declare in its post-election report that this had occurred and that the election, to this extent, had fallen below desirable levels of fairness. (What joy that judgment would bring to governments like Zimbabwe's!) There is, too, a further judge of how the government handles this issue: the electorate. If the sense develops in rural Britain that this government has for party advantage cheated the rural voter and tilted the balance still further towards the urban majority, Labour's vote in its 180 rural or semi-rural seats is likely to suffer. Some of its MPs fear this already. So whatever the hardline rulings, these matters are not yet settled. As things stand today, it is probably right to press on with the local elections - which would clearly open the way for a May 3 general election too. But issues of taste and propriety will also come in to the final balance. Though harder to quantify, they are a central part of politics too.",

And why have ministers failed to resolve the conflict between the chief inspector and director general? Both agree on the appalling conditions, but disagree about solutions. The inspector wants identified individuals to be responsible for conditions which different categories of inmates face. Paul Boateng, the prison minister, is notorious for his knee-jerk condemnations of public service failings. Why is he not facing the sack? There can be no excuse for his failure to resolve the dispute - or his failure to insist on the chief inspector's reappointment. The protection of prisoners makes this imperative.</p>",

And why have ministers failed to resolve the conflict between the chief inspector and director general? Both agree on the appalling conditions, but disagree about solutions. The inspector wants identified individuals to be responsible for conditions which different categories of inmates face. Paul Boateng, the prison minister, is notorious for his knee-jerk condemnations of public service failings. Why is he not facing the sack? There can be no excuse for his failure to resolve the dispute - or his failure to insist on the chief inspector's reappointment. The protection of prisoners makes this imperative.",

      "body": "<p>A hospital health care assistant has been arrested by police investigating the \"unexpected\" deaths of four children on a paediatric ward at a hospital in Berkshire. </p> <p>The unnamed woman, who worked on ward 24 at the Wexham Park hospital in Slough, was questioned by officers from Thames Valley police after consultant paediatricians became concerned about the number of deaths on the ward. </p> <p>Four children, who were all being treated for non life-threatening illnesses, have died on the ward in the last eight months, compared with the usual average of two or three unexpected deaths a year. </p> <p>The hospital yesterday refused to confirm if the health care assistant, who has been released on police bail pending further inquiries, was the last member of staff with the children before they died or whether they shared the same cause of death. </p> <p>Margaret Edwards, chief executive of the Heatherwood and Wexham Park Hospitals Trust, said the deaths could all just be \"coincidence\". </p> <p>\"Taken in isolation all these deaths don't give us any reason for concern. Concern has been raised because we experienced more deaths than we expected. </p> <p>\"It may just be a statistical cluster, a coincidence. But we have taken it seriously and asked the police to investigate.\" </p> <p>Ms Edwards said the circumstances surrounding the death of each child had been reviewed at the time as a matter of routine and nothing suspicious had been found. Postmortem examinations to determine the cause of death proved inconclusive. </p> <p>The hospital and the police refused to reveal the identities of the children to protect their families. But the coroner, Peter Bedford, confirmed the last alleged victim, who is understood to have died very recently, was a baby. </p> <p>Ms Edwards said she had first been alerted to the fact there might be a problem on Monday night when consultant paediatricians who work on the ward had gone to see her and expressed concern at the number of unexpected deaths. Thames Valley police were called in, and on Wednesday evening they arrested the nursing assistant. She has also been suspended. </p> <p>Detective Superintendent Steve Morrison, of Thames Valley police murder squad, said the parents of the children, who were all aged under 16, were distressed by news of the arrest and investigation. </p> <p>\"Clearly, they are very concerned to see that the truth of what has happened is established. We can sympathise with how traumatic this must be for them.\" </p> <p>A family liaison officer had been drafted in to to keep the families informed about the progress of the investigation. </p> <p>Mr Morrison confirmed his officers would be working closely with other constabularies, including Essex, which investigated a nurse over similar allegations last year.

      "bodyText": "A hospital health care assistant has been arrested by police investigating the \"unexpected\" deaths of four children on a paediatric ward at a hospital in Berkshire. The unnamed woman, who worked on ward 24 at the Wexham Park hospital in Slough, was questioned by officers from Thames Valley police after consultant paediatricians became concerned about the number of deaths on the ward. Four children, who were all being treated for non life-threatening illnesses, have died on the ward in the last eight months, compared with the usual average of two or three unexpected deaths a year. The hospital yesterday refused to confirm if the health care assistant, who has been released on police bail pending further inquiries, was the last member of staff with the children before they died or whether they shared the same cause of death. Margaret Edwards, chief executive of the Heatherwood and Wexham Park Hospitals Trust, said the deaths could all just be \"coincidence\". \"Taken in isolation all these deaths don't give us any reason for concern. Concern has been raised because we experienced more deaths than we expected. \"It may just be a statistical cluster, a coincidence. But we have taken it seriously and asked the police to investigate.\" Ms Edwards said the circumstances surrounding the death of each child had been reviewed at the time as a matter of routine and nothing suspicious had been found. Postmortem examinations to determine the cause of death proved inconclusive. The hospital and the police refused to reveal the identities of the children to protect their families. But the coroner, Peter Bedford, confirmed the last alleged victim, who is understood to have died very recently, was a baby. Ms Edwards said she had first been alerted to the fact there might be a problem on Monday night when consultant paediatricians who work on the ward had gone to see her and expressed concern at the number of unexpected deaths. Thames Valley police were called in, and on Wednesday evening they arrested the nursing assistant. She has also been suspended. Detective Superintendent Steve Morrison, of Thames Valley police murder squad, said the parents of the children, who were all aged under 16, were distressed by news of the arrest and investigation. \"Clearly, they are very concerned to see that the truth of what has happened is established. We can sympathise with how traumatic this must be for them.\" A family liaison officer had been drafted in to to keep the families informed about the progress of the investigation. Mr Morrison confirmed his officers would be working closely with other constabularies, including Essex, which investigated a nurse over similar allegations last year. He said there were no immediate plans to exhume bodies of any buried children. \"This is a very early stage in the inquiry. Clearly, a number of people will be interviewed immediately and we will interview anyone who can help us with our inquiry. \"It will take weeks and months to get a clear picture of what is happening.\" Mr Morrison emphasised that all the deaths had occurred on ward 24, which is staffed by 40 nurses and cares for up to 30 children. He said none of the trust's other wards or children's services were under investigation. An incident room has been set up at Maidenhead police station and 15 detectives have been assigned to investigate. Staff at the hospital, which is in parkland on the outskirts of Slough, were said to be \"very distressed\" over the allegations about their colleague.",

Care orders in the community would ensure people continued to comply with treat- ment and cut reduce suicides by 32% a year. Cliff Prior, chief executive of the National Schizophrenia Fellowship, said: \"Deaths in railway crashes are rightly recognised as preventable, but too often suicides involving people with mental illness are seen as inevitable.\"",

      "bodyText": "The real ale drinker, so long maligned for his woolly jumper and beard, is set to get his revenge: ale and stout are about to become the trendiest drinks at the bar. Premium lager and pre-mixed spirit drinks have dominated the \u00a316.8bn drinks industry over the past five years at the expense of traditional stout and ale. But a new report by Datamonitor says stouts and ales are to benefit from a renaissance driven by Belgium brewing giant Interbrew. \"If Interbrew supports and develops real ale brands within its portfolio, such as Flowers and Trophy, it could provide the figurehead brands that renew interest in the ale sector,\" said Neil Broome, Datamonitor consumer markets analyst. Mr Broome said the popularity in the UK of Belgian speciality beers - such as Hoegaarden and Leffe - will open up a market for drinks that require a more discerning palate. The volume of speciality beer sold in the UK between 1995 and 2000 has increased by 1.8m litres. However, the volume of ales and stouts has fallen by 1.1% to just over 3,000m litres over the same period. British consumers drank 6.7bn litres of beer last year, the lowest volume for the past five years. The focus of pub estate owners on branded bars and pubs, family pubs and pub restaurants is paying off. Interbrew is contesting the British competition authorities' ruling that requires it to sell off the Bass business it acquired last year. Even if it retains the Scottish and Irish Bass businesses, there will be room in for a new global player to enter the UK market. Heineken, Carlsberg, SAB and Anheuser-Busch are all likely contenders.",

The boards, which were set up under the Tories 11 years ago, will begin to be amalgamated into the Arts Council next month, and will cease to exist by the end of the year. The move was immediately attacked by the Liberal Democrats, who accused the Arts Council chairman, Gerry Robinson, of trying to \"bounce this outrageous retrograde proposal\" through before the general election. Lib Dem MP Robert Maclennan compared the regional officials who will replace the boards to Nazi provincial \"gauleiters\" who would enforce the Arts Council's \"autocratic whims\" on the regions. He said these \"commercially driven\" changes went against the spirit of the government's drive towards devolution. Mr Robinson, who with the culture secretary, Chris Smith, is credited with last week's \u00a370m rescue package for theatre, used the announcement to reveal he would be staying on for a further three years to push the reforms through.

From 1957 to 1976, he was professor of surgery at Edinburgh University and consultant surgeon to the city's Royal Infirmary. There, on October 30 1960, he performed the first successful organ transplant operation in this country.</p> <p>He had discovered that one of his patients, a miner named Lewis Abbot, had an identical twin brother, and realised that a kidney transplant between twins would minimise the risk of rejection. The operation was hazardous, and post-operative care was problematic, but it eventually proved successful. Woodruff later developed a drug that helped prevent the rejection of transplanted organs by the body's immune system.</p> <p>He was born in London, but two years later, following his father's appointment to the chair of veterinary pathology at the University of Melbourne, the family emigrated to Australia, where Woodruff was brought up. After schooling at Wesley College, Melbourne, he read electrical engineering at the university, where he distinguished himself both as an oarsman and an organist before graduating with first-class honours in 1932.</p> <p>Then he decided to embark on a career in medicine, and graduated in surgery, again with first-class honours, in 1937. During the next four years, he not only began his surgical training at the Royal Melbourne Hospital, but also obtained the higher degrees of doctor of medicine and master of surgery.</p> <p>In 1941, Woodruff volunteered for military service with the Australian Army Medical Corps and joined the 10th general hospital in Malaya, where, the following year, he was taken prisoner by the Japanese. He spent the remainder of the war incarcerated in the notorious prisoner-of-war camp at Changi, Singapore, where he distinguished himself by his efforts to reduce vitamin deficiency diseases among the inadequately fed prisoners - work that formed the basis of the report Deficiency Diseases in Japanese Prison Camps (1951), of which he was co-author.</p> <p>Woodruff came to Britain in 1946 and, while working as tutor in surgery at Sheffield University, was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. Two years later, he was appointed senior lecturer in surgery at the University of Aberdeen, and consultant surgeon to both Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and the Aberdeen Hospital for Sick Children. In 1952, he moved to New Zealand to become professor of surgery at the University of Otago. Five years later, he succeeded Sir James Learmonth at Edinburgh.</p> <p>Woodruff already had an international reputation as an expert in transplant immunology, and his move to Edinburgh opportunely coincided with the commencement of clinical organ transplantation. Under his direction, the university's Wilkie surgical research laboratory became a department dedicated to the study of the immunological aspects of transplant surgery, and was chosen by the Medical Research Council to be the MRC research group on transplantation.</p> <p>Woodruff's book Transplantation Of Tissues and Organs (1960), a monumental text that received international acclaim, was the standard work on the subject for many years. His other publications included The Interaction Of Cancer And Host (1980) and an autobiography, Nothing Venture Nothing Win (1997).</p> <p>In 1968, the clinical renal transplant service, which until then had been based at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, was transferred to the newly-opened Nuffield transplant surgery unit, which had been built to Woodruff's personal specification at the Western General Hospital, although he continued to perform the rest of his surgical work -including responsibility for most of the peripheral vascular surgery carried out in south-east Scotland - at the Royal Infirmary.</p> <p>The University of Melbourne awarded him the degree of doctor of science in 1962. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1968, and became its vice-president in 1979. A knighthood in 1969 was followed by his election to the presidency of the International Transplantation Society and the council of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, and many other British and international honours.</p> <p>Michael Woodruff earned the respect of all who worked with him, both in the research and clinical fields. He possessed a unique capacity for instilling enthusiasm in those who did research work under his direction, and often brought visiting academics to see the laboratory work in action. He was quite unperturbed when a visiting European professor once unwisely disposed of his cigar in a laboratory container holding discarded ether-soaked swabs. The resulting column of fire, quickly contained, simply produced the often-used comment, \"How bizarre\".</p> <p>Woodruff expected his own high standards to be reflected in those who worked under him. His clinical ward rounds were famous as a source of stress for those who unwisely came inadequately prepared, but, if the required high standards had been achieved, he was unstinting in his praise.</p> <p>For nearly 15 years after retirement in 1976, he continued to carry out his studies on cancer immunology, in addition to participating in his lifelong interests of music, sailing and tennis. He was a member of the Royal Forth Yacht Club, and his yachts, Therapist and Therapist II, were familiar sights both in the Firth of Forth and in the Mediterranean.</p> <p>In 1946, he married Hazel Ashby, a botanical scientist from Adelaide. He is survived by her, their two sons (one of whom is a surgeon), and a daughter.</p> <p>\u0095 Michael Francis Addison Woodruff, surgeon, born April 3 1911; died March 10 2001</p>",

After schooling at Wesley College, Melbourne, he read electrical engineering at the university, where he distinguished himself both as an oarsman and an organist before graduating with first-class honours in 1932. Then he decided to embark on a career in medicine, and graduated in surgery, again with first-class honours, in 1937. During the next four years, he not only began his surgical training at the Royal Melbourne Hospital, but also obtained the higher degrees of doctor of medicine and master of surgery. In 1941, Woodruff volunteered for military service with the Australian Army Medical Corps and joined the 10th general hospital in Malaya, where, the following year, he was taken prisoner by the Japanese. He spent the remainder of the war incarcerated in the notorious prisoner-of-war camp at Changi, Singapore, where he distinguished himself by his efforts to reduce vitamin deficiency diseases among the inadequately fed prisoners - work that formed the basis of the report Deficiency Diseases in Japanese Prison Camps (1951), of which he was co-author. Woodruff came to Britain in 1946 and, while working as tutor in surgery at Sheffield University, was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. Two years later, he was appointed senior lecturer in surgery at the University of Aberdeen, and consultant surgeon to both Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and the Aberdeen Hospital for Sick Children. In 1952, he moved to New Zealand to become professor of surgery at the University of Otago. Five years later, he succeeded Sir James Learmonth at Edinburgh. Woodruff already had an international reputation as an expert in transplant immunology, and his move to Edinburgh opportunely coincided with the commencement of clinical organ transplantation. Under his direction, the university's Wilkie surgical research laboratory became a department dedicated to the study of the immunological aspects of transplant surgery, and was chosen by the Medical Research Council to be the MRC research group on transplantation. Woodruff's book Transplantation Of Tissues and Organs (1960), a monumental text that received international acclaim, was the standard work on the subject for many years. His other publications included The Interaction Of Cancer And Host (1980) and an autobiography, Nothing Venture Nothing Win (1997). In 1968, the clinical renal transplant service, which until then had been based at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, was transferred to the newly-opened Nuffield transplant surgery unit, which had been built to Woodruff's personal specification at the Western General Hospital, although he continued to perform the rest of his surgical work -including responsibility for most of the peripheral vascular surgery carried out in south-east Scotland - at the Royal Infirmary. The University of Melbourne awarded him the degree of doctor of science in 1962. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1968, and became its vice-president in 1979. A knighthood in 1969 was followed by his election to the presidency of the International Transplantation Society and the council of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, and many other British and international honours. Michael Woodruff earned the respect of all who worked with him, both in the research and clinical fields. He possessed a unique capacity for instilling enthusiasm in those who did research work under his direction, and often brought visiting academics to see the laboratory work in action. He was quite unperturbed when a visiting European professor once unwisely disposed of his cigar in a laboratory container holding discarded ether-soaked swabs. The resulting column of fire, quickly contained, simply produced the often-used comment, \"How bizarre\". Woodruff expected his own high standards to be reflected in those who worked under him. His clinical ward rounds were famous as a source of stress for those who unwisely came inadequately prepared, but, if the required high standards had been achieved, he was unstinting in his praise. For nearly 15 years after retirement in 1976, he continued to carry out his studies on cancer immunology, in addition to participating in his lifelong interests of music, sailing and tennis. He was a member of the Royal Forth Yacht Club, and his yachts, Therapist and Therapist II, were familiar sights both in the Firth of Forth and in the Mediterranean. In 1946, he married Hazel Ashby, a botanical scientist from Adelaide. He is survived by her, their two sons (one of whom is a surgeon), and a daughter. \u0095 Michael Francis Addison Woodruff, surgeon, born April 3 1911; died March 10 2001",

      "body": "<p>George Simon, who has died aged 88, was one of the pioneer jazz critics. He stood out as champion of the decade or so during which large jazz and dance orchestras, and their singers, were accorded the kind of coverage now devoted to rappers and rockers. For Simon's Glenn Miller And His Orchestra (1974), Bing Crosby wrote the introduction; for his The Big Bands (1974) - he covered more than 400 and gives 72 their own chapters - Frank Sinatra did the honours.</p> <p>In 1935, Simon left Harvard University to become an associate editor on the music magazine Metronome. While lacking the power to make or break, he did wield influence, and the reputation of some tyro bandleaders could rise after a few favourable mentions. He recommended pianist Mel Powell to Benny Goodman, and Woody Herman's bands were known as herds following a Simon review.</p> <p>Ironically, perhaps, his most-quoted critique was the slating he gave the Count Basie band in 1937; though he recognised the swing, he continued on the lines of, \"If you think that the sax section is out of tune, catch the brass.\" Commenting on this in later years, he pointed out that musicians in many black bands could not afford to buy the best instruments.</p> <p>Simon described himself as the lowbrow member of an upper middle-class Jewish family. While his eldest brother, who founded the publishers Simon &amp; Schuster, practised piano concertos, and another brother reviewed classical music, George would be in the basement with his jazz records and his drum kit.</p> <p>His job with Metronome put him in touch with several musicians, including Glenn Miller, then playing trombone for Ray Noble. Simon helped organise the personnel of the original Miller band, and played drums on their first recording. During the second world war, he once more helped to organise, and occasionally drummed in, early versions of Miller's army air force band. He was eventually put in charge of V Discs, 12-inch vinyl 78rpm records sent to the troops - and, not surprisingly, recorded many stars of the swing era.</p> <p>The postwar shift to small, bebop-influenced groups was not entirely to Simon's tastes. After 20 years with Metronome, the last 15 as editor-in-chief, he worked mainly in and around the record industry, though he had spells covering jazz for the New York Herald Tribune and the New York Post.</p> <p>In between writing books, he produced albums for different companies, and acted as a consultant on TV programmes, including the acclaimed Timex jazz series. For several years, he was executive director of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, which runs the Grammy awards.</p> <p>Instead of attempting to keep pace with every musical development, Simon's books reflect his unique and invaluable role as eyewitness to, and chronicler of, the 1935-45 decade. He won an ASCAP award for The Big Bands and, some years later, won a Grammy award himself for his sleeve note to a Bing Crosby album, written at Crosby's request.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife, two children and three grandchildren.</p> <p>\u0095 George Thomas Simon, journalist, born May 9 1912; died February 13 2001</p>",

      "bodyText": "George Simon, who has died aged 88, was one of the pioneer jazz critics. He stood out as champion of the decade or so during which large jazz and dance orchestras, and their singers, were accorded the kind of coverage now devoted to rappers and rockers. For Simon's Glenn Miller And His Orchestra (1974), Bing Crosby wrote the introduction; for his The Big Bands (1974) - he covered more than 400 and gives 72 their own chapters - Frank Sinatra did the honours. In 1935, Simon left Harvard University to become an associate editor on the music magazine Metronome. While lacking the power to make or break, he did wield influence, and the reputation of some tyro bandleaders could rise after a few favourable mentions. He recommended pianist Mel Powell to Benny Goodman, and Woody Herman's bands were known as herds following a Simon review. Ironically, perhaps, his most-quoted critique was the slating he gave the Count Basie band in 1937; though he recognised the swing, he continued on the lines of, \"If you think that the sax section is out of tune, catch the brass.\" Commenting on this in later years, he pointed out that musicians in many black bands could not afford to buy the best instruments. Simon described himself as the lowbrow member of an upper middle-class Jewish family. While his eldest brother, who founded the publishers Simon &amp; Schuster, practised piano concertos, and another brother reviewed classical music, George would be in the basement with his jazz records and his drum kit. His job with Metronome put him in touch with several musicians, including Glenn Miller, then playing trombone for Ray Noble. Simon helped organise the personnel of the original Miller band, and played drums on their first recording. During the second world war, he once more helped to organise, and occasionally drummed in, early versions of Miller's army air force band. He was eventually put in charge of V Discs, 12-inch vinyl 78rpm records sent to the troops - and, not surprisingly, recorded many stars of the swing era. The postwar shift to small, bebop-influenced groups was not entirely to Simon's tastes. After 20 years with Metronome, the last 15 as editor-in-chief, he worked mainly in and around the record industry, though he had spells covering jazz for the New York Herald Tribune and the New York Post. In between writing books, he produced albums for different companies, and acted as a consultant on TV programmes, including the acclaimed Timex jazz series. For several years, he was executive director of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, which runs the Grammy awards. Instead of attempting to keep pace with every musical development, Simon's books reflect his unique and invaluable role as eyewitness to, and chronicler of, the 1935-45 decade. He won an ASCAP award for The Big Bands and, some years later, won a Grammy award himself for his sleeve note to a Bing Crosby album, written at Crosby's request. He is survived by his wife, two children and three grandchildren. \u0095 George Thomas Simon, journalist, born May 9 1912; died February 13 2001",

As honorary chairman, Mr Berlusconi has watched the club's increasingly dismal performances with alarm. On Tuesday it crashed out of the Champions League. On Wednesday, Mr Berlusconi watched as the conflict of interest between his politics and business was the subject of a satirical show on state-run RAI television. The comedy show, Satyricon, provided the unusual setting for the presentation of a book detailing the alleged links between Mr Berlusconi's entourage and the Mafia, culled from court papers, Bank of Italy investigations and an interview with a magistrate. Among the claims in The Odour of Money is that Mr Berlusconi's 1994 government made tax changes under which his Mediaset broadcasting group gained \u00a365m. Mr Berlusconi's success in the 1994 general election coincided with trophies for AC Milan both in Italy's Serie A and in Europe. But the team is now languishing in mid-table. Mr Berlusconi decided that enough was enough: coach Alberto Zaccheroni, who is also suspected of harbouring leftwing sympathies, had to go. His trusted pollsters say the team's bad results have been eroding his advantage over the centre-left candidate, the former mayor of Rome, Francesco Rutelli. The media magnate distanced himself from the club management, insisting that he was just the honorary chairman and that he could not take time off from politics to pay closer attention to the team's flagging fortunes. This was the first time that the coach of a major Italian club had been sacked by a passer-by, scoffed the Left Democrat MP Giuseppe Giulietti. Mr Berlusconi's political rivals have been quick to exploit his sporting discomfiture and are fielding the former AC Milan star Gianni Rivera to run against him in his Milan seat. \"When Milan was top of the league he was the architect of the victories. Now that the results are lacking he has nothing to do with it,\" said the Rome daily, La Repubblica. Mr Rivera, who is now undersecretary of defence, said he intended to emphasise Mr Berlusconi's intolerable conflict of interests. \"It's to be hoped that Berlusconi decides to take a real interest in the fortunes of Milan,\" Mr Rivera told the Turin daily, La Stampa. \"In that way we would resolve two problems in one go: his conflict of interests in politics would end and Milan would return to its ancient splendour. Perhaps.\"",

The unnamed woman, who worked on ward 24 at the Wexham Park hospital in Slough, was questioned by officers from Thames Valley police after consultant paediatricians became concerned about the number of deaths on the ward. Four children, who were all being treated for non life-threatening illnesses, have died on the ward in the last eight months, compared with the usual average of two or three unexpected deaths a year. The hospital yesterday refused to confirm if the health care assistant, who has been released on police bail pending further inquiries, was the last member of staff with the children before they died or whether they shared the same cause of death. Margaret Edwards, chief executive of the Heatherwood and Wexham Park Hospitals Trust, said the deaths could all just be \"coincidence\". \"Taken in isolation all these deaths don't give us any reason for concern. Concern has been raised because we experienced more deaths than we expected. \"It may just be a statistical cluster, a coincidence.

Mr Ollila said the company had maintained margins and earnings growth by quickening the pace of its continuing programmes to wring further efficiencies and cost savings from the business. The statement also said Nokia had managed to increase its market share during the downturn. Ericsson said on Monday that it would post a loss in the first quarter, while last month Motorola warned of a dramatic slowdown in sales and announced its intention to cut some 7,000 jobs.",

We know the disease has been spreading faster than Maff can run, and we know that a conscious effort must be made to get in front of it. So all sheep classed as dangerous contacts from two livestock markets - Welshpool on February 19, and Northampton on February 15 and 22 - if found, will be culled. But where will it all end?

Hardly ever have western governments asked themselves what was the most effective way of dealing with the crises in that region with which they were confronted. Their question was always different: what was the least risky and least costly way of responding?</p> <p>And, almost invariably, this approach, at once timorous and unrealistic, has led on to new emergencies, as it has in Kosovo and now in Macedonia. Yesterday's decision by the US to wind down its Bosnian forces will not help. While it will probably not make Bosnia itself a more dangerous place, it sends signals that could further weaken international efforts to keep the peace elsewhere in former Yugoslavia.</p> <p>It would be too much to say that the victory in Kosovo has been thrown away. As an indirect result of that operation, Serbia is back on the road toward normal national life. Croatia was already following that route and continues to do so. Bosnia remains a fragmented place, but violence has ended and nationalist madness is in check. In Kosovo, the lives of ordinary Albanians, although not of Serbs, are better than they would have been in other circumstances, and many useful and worthwhile things have been done. But the way in which Kosovo has been administered by its international protectors over the past 20 months has been deeply flawed. A lack of political courage and a failure of military will means that those who are supposedly in charge of Kosovo are temporising with the forces of political extremism and organised crime.</p> <p>It is truly a shameful thing that the Kosovo Force should be watching as Serbian soldiers return to the buffer zone to do the job of keeping guerrillas out of Serbian territory which the international forces were unwilling to do. It is equally shameful that K-For should have permitted guerrillas to cross into Macedonia and cause increasingly serious trouble there.

      "bodyText": "The Balkan wars have, over the past 10 years, constituted one long series of lessons in the foolishness of taking the easy way out. Hardly ever have western governments asked themselves what was the most effective way of dealing with the crises in that region with which they were confronted. Their question was always different: what was the least risky and least costly way of responding? And, almost invariably, this approach, at once timorous and unrealistic, has led on to new emergencies, as it has in Kosovo and now in Macedonia. Yesterday's decision by the US to wind down its Bosnian forces will not help. While it will probably not make Bosnia itself a more dangerous place, it sends signals that could further weaken international efforts to keep the peace elsewhere in former Yugoslavia. It would be too much to say that the victory in Kosovo has been thrown away. As an indirect result of that operation, Serbia is back on the road toward normal national life. Croatia was already following that route and continues to do so. Bosnia remains a fragmented place, but violence has ended and nationalist madness is in check. In Kosovo, the lives of ordinary Albanians, although not of Serbs, are better than they would have been in other circumstances, and many useful and worthwhile things have been done. But the way in which Kosovo has been administered by its international protectors over the past 20 months has been deeply flawed. A lack of political courage and a failure of military will means that those who are supposedly in charge of Kosovo are temporising with the forces of political extremism and organised crime. It is truly a shameful thing that the Kosovo Force should be watching as Serbian soldiers return to the buffer zone to do the job of keeping guerrillas out of Serbian territory which the international forces were unwilling to do. It is equally shameful that K-For should have permitted guerrillas to cross into Macedonia and cause increasingly serious trouble there. This is not to expect perfect control in remote border areas but rather to ask where is the evidence, not just of effective surveillance, but of effective interdiction? Where were the ambushes, the arrests, and the detentions? With a few exceptions they never happened, because K-For, and particularly its American contingent, did not want to fight or, more accurately, were under instructions from their home capitals to avoid fighting.

      "body": "<p>There are few more uncomfortable places for a foreign correspondent to be posted than Israel. Opinions are so polarised that it is almost impossible to write a line on the conflict without outraging someone.</p> <p>Since the second intifada exploded last October, as criticism of Israel has escalated and casualties mounted towards the 400 mark, this fact has been brought home especially to those who deal sympathetically with the plight of the Palestinians. All have found themselves deluged with complaints, which not infrequently include innuendoes - or outright accusations - of anti-semitism.</p> <p>No one has been more ready to use this weapon than Conrad Black. Black is the proprietor of the Hollinger Group, whose British publications include the Daily and Sunday Telegraphs and the Spectator, and who also owns the Jerusalem Post. The different papers all reflect Black's notably rightwing brand of Zionism which tends to regard the Palestinians, like their leader Yasser Arafat (to quote from an article he wrote in the Post in 1993,) as \"vile and primitive\".</p> <p>As a result, uniquely among British papers, the foreign pages of the Daily and Sunday Telegraphs have contained a notable absence of clear, critical reporting of Israel's deadly methods of suppressing Palestinian dissent. Their comment pages have been even more extreme.</p> <p>Recent highlights have included Edward Luttwack, a former Israeli tank commander and friend of Black, writing to celebrate the election of Sharon whom he praised as \"a master of outwitting his opponents\", and a \"raging bull who is really a matador\" - as if he were some sort of jolly sporting hero rather than the man who failed to stop the single most gruesome massacre in the entire Arab-Israeli conflict.

      "bodyText": "There are few more uncomfortable places for a foreign correspondent to be posted than Israel. Opinions are so polarised that it is almost impossible to write a line on the conflict without outraging someone. Since the second intifada exploded last October, as criticism of Israel has escalated and casualties mounted towards the 400 mark, this fact has been brought home especially to those who deal sympathetically with the plight of the Palestinians. All have found themselves deluged with complaints, which not infrequently include innuendoes - or outright accusations - of anti-semitism. No one has been more ready to use this weapon than Conrad Black. Black is the proprietor of the Hollinger Group, whose British publications include the Daily and Sunday Telegraphs and the Spectator, and who also owns the Jerusalem Post. The different papers all reflect Black's notably rightwing brand of Zionism which tends to regard the Palestinians, like their leader Yasser Arafat (to quote from an article he wrote in the Post in 1993,) as \"vile and primitive\". As a result, uniquely among British papers, the foreign pages of the Daily and Sunday Telegraphs have contained a notable absence of clear, critical reporting of Israel's deadly methods of suppressing Palestinian dissent. Their comment pages have been even more extreme. Recent highlights have included Edward Luttwack, a former Israeli tank commander and friend of Black, writing to celebrate the election of Sharon whom he praised as \"a master of outwitting his opponents\", and a \"raging bull who is really a matador\" - as if he were some sort of jolly sporting hero rather than the man who failed to stop the single most gruesome massacre in the entire Arab-Israeli conflict. Then there are the regular appearances of Black's wife, Barbara Amiel, who recently concluded a two-page spread in the Telegraph by comparing the Palestinians to \"animals\". It was against this background that a major row erupted three weeks ago when the Spectator columnist Taki (familiar to Guardian readers from his frequent appearances as a runaway waiter in Matthew Norman's diary) broke the unspoken ban on criticising Israel in a Black paper by writing a piece which Black described, in an emotional 3,000-word retort, as \"almost worthy of Goebbels\". Since then the Spectator letters page has been like a war zone, with Black flinging increasingly hysterical accusations at anyone who dissents from his views. Lord Gilmour, who had written to defend Taki, was accused of \"seeming like a common or garden Jew baiter\".

In fact, while anti-Jewish writing is today more or less confined to a few neo-Nazi hate rags, straightforwardly racist depictions of the Arabs are still widespread and relatively acceptable: in the past few months we have had Congressional candidates calling the Palestinians \"lower than pond scum\" and a senior Israeli rabbi denouncing them as \"snakes and scorpions\", quite apart from the epithets Black and his wife have thrown at them.

      "body": "<p>My relationship with my mother is abysmal and I'm considering severing links. I do not believe she loves me at all. For as long as I can recall she has periodically stopped speaking to me, without provocation. Eventually she comes around, without apology. She presented herself as attentive at my wedding four years ago, having shown no interest in the preparations. Then I decided to withdraw, as I realised that the more I hope for love, the more she disappoints me. However, I contacted her after my son's birth last year and during her three subsequent visits her interest has focused upon him. My husband believes we should not deny her a relationship with our son. Should I put up with such treatment for the sake of my mother's relationship with her grandchild?</p> <p><b> Put your happiness first</b><br></p> <p>Speaking as someone who has been the grandchild in a similar situation, I think your happiness as your son's mother should come before your son's relationship with his grandmother. My mother had a dreadful relationship with her own mother, but endured years of family visits to me and my two siblings so we could have a relationship with our grandmother. As we got older, we became increasingly aware of the tension in the house every time these visits took place, which was unpleasant and upsetting for us all.</p> <p>Eventually, when I was about 10, the visits stopped and my mum cut off all contact with my grandmother. The relationship was never re-established, and my grandmother has since died. I didn't miss the contact with her at all, and it was obvious that our mother was relieved not to have to endure her presence any longer.</p> <p>Do not feel guilty for depriving your son of his grandmother - she is responsible for her behaviour and the loss of her relationship with you, and he will not thank you for having to play piggy in the middle between his mother and grandmother. Tell her what you intend to do (ie sever links) and why. It is up to her to make amends.</p> <p>Name and address withheld</p> <p><b> Tell her how you feel</b><br></p> <p>Don't even consider severing links with your mother. She will probably become your best friend. My mother died nearly 30 years ago, so she never knew my three daughters and didn't have the opportunity to tell me how they should be brought up or whether I should return to work when the youngest started school etc. In spite of that, I miss her dreadfully and now that my daughters are leaving home after university, I wish I could ask her how she felt when I left home.</p> <p>It seems, from speaking to friends whose mothers are still alive, that they become increasingly close the older they become and the more experiences they share. I sometimes feel I am being fitted in to my daughters' busy lives and that there is no time to talk. It would be easy for me to just slip out of their lives. Make time to talk to your mother and tell her how you feel.</p> <p>Name and address withheld</p> <p><b> Don't waste your time</b><br></p> <p>Trust your instincts and feelings - if you believe that your mother does not love you, you are probably right. It happens, despite what many will tell you. If you can come to accept this while you are a young woman with much to look forward to, you have a good chance of being happy.</p> <p>Don't spend the rest of your mother's life in an almost certainly hopeless attempt to persuade her to love you through your son or by whatever other means, as I did to my cost. Your mother's lack of love for you is not your fault; it is her loss. You may well find in the future that other family members and close friends will confirm what you already suspect - that your mother is incapable of loving anyone. Given this, what does she have to offer your son in a relationship with him? It will lead only to grief and rifts within your potentially happy home. Your son will understand later on when you explain things to him honestly. Be brave - cut your ties!</p> <p>Helen Young, Halifax</p> <p><b> Let your son stay in touch</b><br></p> <p>My relationship with my mother was abysmal too, and for years I fantasised about severing connections with her, until I found the courage two years ago, in my late 30s. My mother was manipulative and critical, and did not really love me. Despite this I continued a relationship with her in the hope that one day I would get the love and praise I craved from her.</p> <p>Eventually I realised this would never happen and brought matters to a close. My sister chose the same path for the same reasons. She kept lines of communication open so that her two children could have contact with their grandmother, but sadly she has shown little interest in them. We both feel relieved and liberated by ending the farce that was our relationship with the woman who gave birth to us.</p> <p>By all means break off contact with her for your own sake, but leave the possibility for her to have contact with your child.

      "bodyText": "The FTSE 100 entered the official closing period last night 43 points higher; 10 minutes later it was 103.3 points better at 5,729.2. The London Stock Exchange insists nothing untoward went on but traders were bemused. The exchange introduced the controversial system, which calculates the end-of-day prices for all stocks traded in the electronic order book, Sets, last year to afford investors the opportunity to deal at the closing price. When the order book closes at 4.30pm, all Sets stocks go into the \"auction\", where buyers and sellers can enter a price at which they are prepared to deal. Using a complex formula, the auction then comes up with one price that satisfies greatest numbers of orders. This becomes the closing price. According the exchange, yesterday's spike reflected the strong buying demand in the market at the end of the session. This seemed at odds with events elsewhere.

      "body": "<p>Beleaguered frozen food group Iceland yesterday delivered its third profits alert this year and said that higher one-off costs will push the group deep into the red. </p> <p>Only four months ago analysts believed the company was on track to make a \u00a3130m profit this year. Six weeks ago, new chief executive Bill Grimsey said they would be no more than \u00a362m, and yesterday he said the true figure for the 15 months to the end of March would be no more than \u00a340m - and that would be wiped out by \u00a366m of exceptional costs. </p> <p>The group, which was a City favourite last year, has been battered by the departure of executives including founder and chairman Malcolm Walker, who resigned after selling 4m shares, netting \u00a313m, just before the first signs of any problems emerged. </p> <p>The chain has been stung by its high profile switch into organic food - which customers did not buy. </p> <p>Yesterday Mr Grimsey, who was hired in December to run what he thought was a booming business, revealed that the move into organics, which had been championed by Mr Walker, would wipe \u00a38m off the bottom line this year, \u00a34m next year and \u00a32m in 2003. </p> <p>Mr Grimsey, who previously ran the Wickes DIY business, has ditched organics to return to the firm's old strength of cheap deals and \"bogof\" - buy one, get one free - promotions. </p> <p>Sales are still on the slide.

      "bodyText": "Beleaguered frozen food group Iceland yesterday delivered its third profits alert this year and said that higher one-off costs will push the group deep into the red. Only four months ago analysts believed the company was on track to make a \u00a3130m profit this year. Six weeks ago, new chief executive Bill Grimsey said they would be no more than \u00a362m, and yesterday he said the true figure for the 15 months to the end of March would be no more than \u00a340m - and that would be wiped out by \u00a366m of exceptional costs. The group, which was a City favourite last year, has been battered by the departure of executives including founder and chairman Malcolm Walker, who resigned after selling 4m shares, netting \u00a313m, just before the first signs of any problems emerged. The chain has been stung by its high profile switch into organic food - which customers did not buy. Yesterday Mr Grimsey, who was hired in December to run what he thought was a booming business, revealed that the move into organics, which had been championed by Mr Walker, would wipe \u00a38m off the bottom line this year, \u00a34m next year and \u00a32m in 2003. Mr Grimsey, who previously ran the Wickes DIY business, has ditched organics to return to the firm's old strength of cheap deals and \"bogof\" - buy one, get one free - promotions. Sales are still on the slide. In the three months to the end of March, they are expected to be down 3.7%. Six weeks ago Mr Grimsey estimated a 2.5% downturn. Iceland has \u00a3530m of debt, which it took on last year when it merged with the Booker cash and carry and catering supplies business. Rumours had been circulating that the group was in danger of breaching its banking covenants and was considering a rescue rights issue. Yesterday, Mr Grimsey denied the rumours, and insisted Iceland had no problems with servicing its debt. \"We have now had enough time to go over the books and I'm confident as I can be that we have now uncovered everything and am comfortable that we have a base on which to build an outlook for the group,\" he said. \"My most immediate concern is current trading. I'll be working very hard to restore sales growth and am confident I can do it.\" Mr Grimsey has hired several ex-Wickes executives and 21 senior managers are to benefit from an incentive scheme, though the details have yet to be finalised. A strategic plan is to be announced in June which will detail \" a lengthy process of rehabilitation\". The \u00a366m of one-off costs include a hefty \u00a320m to pull out of organic food supply deals. Another \u00a37m relates to banking fees relating to the Booker deal. He refused to blame his predecessors for the company's appalling figures. A source close to the company said: \"He is not going to point the finger, but clearly the internal controls were completely inadequate and the financial reporting system was grossly inadequate if the board thought the business was going to make \u00a3130m and the real figure is \u00a340m\". Iceland's shares - which have fallen by more than 50% since Christmas - rose 10p to 162.5p, despite the grim news.

The Frenchman brought in by the government to run the Greenwich project announced that he was withdrawing a bid to take over the giant tent. He pulled out of the race as ministers admitted that a buyer is unlikely to be selected before the end of the year; Mr Gerbeau claimed it could take as long as 18 months. Mr Gerbeau's \"very sad\" decision risks triggering further embarrassment for Tony Blair over a dome fiasco that has already seen negotiations fail with two previous bidders. \"I want to get on with my life and I want to stay in Britain,\" said Mr Gerbeau. \"I want to go and find a business to run, anything that's got a strong brand and is pretty much in trouble. I'm a pretty good brand promoter and a fixer.\" The favourite to take the dome off the government's hands is a consortium that in cludes the BBC, Madame Tussaud's and the Duke of Westminster's Grosvenor Estates property company. But Mr Gerbeau, the former chief executive, could yet return as a member of another consortium as he seeks to retain the structure as an entertainment venture. Mr Gerbeau's New Dome Partners group was backed by Ministry of Sound nightclub owner James Palumbo, a friend of ex-dome minister Peter Mandelson, but his bid was dogged by doubts over his ability to finance and operate the complex. David James, the troubleshooter brought in after Mr Gerbeau to prevent it collapsing in a financial crisis, dismissed the Frenchman's bid as \"puff\" and suggested the dome would never be a success as an entertainment venue. The Japanese bank Nomura pulled out of the race before Christmas, while in February ministers rejected an offer from the Legacy consortium now threatening to sue over its costs. Mr Gerbeau, a former French ice hockey international, was arguably one of the few people involved with the dome to come out of it reasonably well, his bonhomie helping save the project after initial criticism that he had overplayed his previous position in Disneyland Paris. He is still waiting to learn whether an estimated \u00a345,000 bonus is to be paid, despite being promised that he would receive the money in February. Mr Blair had promised the dome would be the \"envy of the world\" though Prince Charles, who never visited the site, dismissed it as a \"monstrous blancmange\".

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The slaughter of up to a million animals and, worse, the disposal of their carcasses without risk of further spreading foot and mouth infection is both a terrible task and a daunting logistical problem.</p> <p>Jim Scudamore, the chief veterinary surgeon, estimated it would take three weeks to a month to clear the infected areas of Dumfries and Galloway in southern Scotland and Cumbria of all farm animals. Every animal inside each 3km exclusion zone will be destroyed, and where zones overlap and thousands of sheep and cattle roam, the landscape will be emptied of livestock.</p> <p>Trained slaughtermen will today start killing healthy animals and will work their way through herds of cattle most susceptible to the disease. Priority will be given to killing and disposing of animals closest to existing outbreaks.</p> <p>To cope with the vast numbers involved, the ministry is having to set up new ways to kill and dispose of animals. The army has been asked to help plan the logistics but not provide people to kill the animals; disposal of the carcasses is the main problem.</p> <p>Up to now, the ministry has been burning most animals but this is proving time-consuming and thousands of tonnes of straw and coal have to be shifted to infected farms. A flock of sheep 1,000 strong requires a fire a kilometre long, 2,000 bales of straw and 300 tonnes of coal.</p> <p>A second method, favoured during the 1967 epidemic, is to bury the carcasses. This is a relatively quick and easy operation which prevents the virus spreading. But it is not possible in many areas of the country where the ground water is pumped from wells. Water companies and the environment agency are consulted each time burying is suggested. Most schemes have been rejected.</p> <p>Criticism of carcasses left lying in fields has already led the ministry to step up its efforts at quicker disposal of decomposing bodies. Rather than burn carcasses, lorries capable of being sealed are being hired to take them to rendering plants.</p> <p><b> Boiled down</b><br></p> <p>Vets are so nervous of spreading the disease that lorries are filled with water and tipped up to make sure there are no leaks. Last week, despite objection from farmers, a rendering plant was opened in Widnes, Cheshire. Its sole purpose is to boil down carcasses 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p> <p>The dead animals are chopped up and boiled down, leaving bonemeal and tallow - a form of hard fat. Though heat kills the virus, leaving the residue harmless, it is still being fed into incinerators to be certain.</p> <p>But the Widnes incinerator cannot cope alone and yesterday a second plant began operation in Exeter to try to catch up with the backlog of dead animals in Devon. Yesterday, the ministry said it was negotiating with two more rendering plants, which it also hoped would work continuously.</p> <p>Even so, after yesterday's announcement, these measures will be inadequate.</p> <p>Nick Brown, the agriculture minister, acting on veterinary advice, wants all animals disposed of as quickly as possible. Priority will still be given to disposing of animals in new outbreaks but slaughtermen will systematically work their way through the rest.</p> <p>Using lessons learned in the BSE crisis when thousands of apparently healthy animals had to be slaughtered and removed from the food chain, the ministry is to open a number of abattoirs to kill and freeze animals.</p> <p>All abattoirs in the existing infected areas have been shut since the restrictions were imposed on movement of animals on February 23. Now they will be busy again killing healthy animals which will never reach the food chain.</p> <p>Many abattoirs have large cold stores which will freeze the meat until there is capacity in rendering plants to dispose of them. If they become full, as they rapidly will, the ministry will hire further cold stores.</p> <p>In Dumfries and Galloway alone, 200,000 animals are expected to be slaughtered under the clearance scheme - at least as many again will be killed in Cumbria.</p> <p>Elsewhere, similar schemes will also be needed. In Devon, the slaughter of entire infected areas is not planned at present but to prevent the continued spread of the disease, inspections of all farm animals will take place every two days. If there is any sign of infection, all animals will be killed.</p> <p>The entire stock that went through three markets, 21,000 at Longtown, near Carlisle, 8,000 in Welshpool and 3,300 in Northampton will be killed, although some have already been destroyed because they have been infected.</p> <p>Any animals from anywhere in the country which have been moved into west Wales, mid and northern Scotland and East Anglia will be traced and slaughtered. This is not thought to be very many, otherwise these areas would have already developed some cases.</p> <p>Healthy animals, mostly sheep, stranded away from home farms and unable to return to lamb, present another distressing problem. Estimates of numbers vary from 250,000 to 500,000. Yesterday, Mr Brown proposed a new licence scheme, to be carefully policed, which would enable some sheep to be moved to home farms provided they were not in infected areas or being moved from infected areas to disease free areas. Farmers will be able to apply to licences to move them over the weekend.</p> <p>Farmers in parts of the country subject to movement bans, and faced with seeing many of their lambs die because sheep are left to give birth in exposed areas, can apply to the ministry to kill flocks on welfare grounds. They will be paid around 70% of the market value of the stock. <br><br><b>What's going on?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,443686,00.html\">Full list: outbreaks and precautionary measures</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\">Causes and effects</a></p> <p><b>The front line</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html\">06.03.2001: Meet our panel</a><br>What is the situation on the ground?

      "bodyText": "The slaughter of up to a million animals and, worse, the disposal of their carcasses without risk of further spreading foot and mouth infection is both a terrible task and a daunting logistical problem. Jim Scudamore, the chief veterinary surgeon, estimated it would take three weeks to a month to clear the infected areas of Dumfries and Galloway in southern Scotland and Cumbria of all farm animals. Every animal inside each 3km exclusion zone will be destroyed, and where zones overlap and thousands of sheep and cattle roam, the landscape will be emptied of livestock. Trained slaughtermen will today start killing healthy animals and will work their way through herds of cattle most susceptible to the disease. Priority will be given to killing and disposing of animals closest to existing outbreaks. To cope with the vast numbers involved, the ministry is having to set up new ways to kill and dispose of animals. The army has been asked to help plan the logistics but not provide people to kill the animals; disposal of the carcasses is the main problem. Up to now, the ministry has been burning most animals but this is proving time-consuming and thousands of tonnes of straw and coal have to be shifted to infected farms. A flock of sheep 1,000 strong requires a fire a kilometre long, 2,000 bales of straw and 300 tonnes of coal. A second method, favoured during the 1967 epidemic, is to bury the carcasses. This is a relatively quick and easy operation which prevents the virus spreading. But it is not possible in many areas of the country where the ground water is pumped from wells. Water companies and the environment agency are consulted each time burying is suggested. Most schemes have been rejected. Criticism of carcasses left lying in fields has already led the ministry to step up its efforts at quicker disposal of decomposing bodies. Rather than burn carcasses, lorries capable of being sealed are being hired to take them to rendering plants. Boiled down Vets are so nervous of spreading the disease that lorries are filled with water and tipped up to make sure there are no leaks. Last week, despite objection from farmers, a rendering plant was opened in Widnes, Cheshire. Its sole purpose is to boil down carcasses 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The dead animals are chopped up and boiled down, leaving bonemeal and tallow - a form of hard fat. Though heat kills the virus, leaving the residue harmless, it is still being fed into incinerators to be certain. But the Widnes incinerator cannot cope alone and yesterday a second plant began operation in Exeter to try to catch up with the backlog of dead animals in Devon. Yesterday, the ministry said it was negotiating with two more rendering plants, which it also hoped would work continuously. Even so, after yesterday's announcement, these measures will be inadequate. Nick Brown, the agriculture minister, acting on veterinary advice, wants all animals disposed of as quickly as possible. Priority will still be given to disposing of animals in new outbreaks but slaughtermen will systematically work their way through the rest. Using lessons learned in the BSE crisis when thousands of apparently healthy animals had to be slaughtered and removed from the food chain, the ministry is to open a number of abattoirs to kill and freeze animals. All abattoirs in the existing infected areas have been shut since the restrictions were imposed on movement of animals on February 23. Now they will be busy again killing healthy animals which will never reach the food chain. Many abattoirs have large cold stores which will freeze the meat until there is capacity in rendering plants to dispose of them. If they become full, as they rapidly will, the ministry will hire further cold stores. In Dumfries and Galloway alone, 200,000 animals are expected to be slaughtered under the clearance scheme - at least as many again will be killed in Cumbria. Elsewhere, similar schemes will also be needed. In Devon, the slaughter of entire infected areas is not planned at present but to prevent the continued spread of the disease, inspections of all farm animals will take place every two days. If there is any sign of infection, all animals will be killed. The entire stock that went through three markets, 21,000 at Longtown, near Carlisle, 8,000 in Welshpool and 3,300 in Northampton will be killed, although some have already been destroyed because they have been infected. Any animals from anywhere in the country which have been moved into west Wales, mid and northern Scotland and East Anglia will be traced and slaughtered. This is not thought to be very many, otherwise these areas would have already developed some cases. Healthy animals, mostly sheep, stranded away from home farms and unable to return to lamb, present another distressing problem. Estimates of numbers vary from 250,000 to 500,000. Yesterday, Mr Brown proposed a new licence scheme, to be carefully policed, which would enable some sheep to be moved to home farms provided they were not in infected areas or being moved from infected areas to disease free areas. Farmers will be able to apply to licences to move them over the weekend. Farmers in parts of the country subject to movement bans, and faced with seeing many of their lambs die because sheep are left to give birth in exposed areas, can apply to the ministry to kill flocks on welfare grounds. They will be paid around 70% of the market value of the stock. What's going on?

So will their ewes, whose calls - all the same to the human ear but distinctive to the lambs - are now muffled inside Totteridge's barns.</p> <p>Remembering his experiences in the 1967 outbreak - \"It came very close that time,\" he says - Mr Wells is looking after the 150 adult flock in one shed, the lambs in another and the rams out in the fields. On this, and on a pastoral regime as strict as in an ebola ward, depend his hopes of the fifth generation - his son Anthony - taking over the Totteridge sheep when he retires.</p> <p>\"We've done all that we can,\" said Mr Wells, taking a break in the kitchen with his wife Pat and a helper, Clare Giles, who has joined the besieged, mellow stone buildings to help the isolation system work. She looks after the horses while Mr Wells feeds seven cows on an outstation of the farm and his wife takes care of the sheep.</p> <p>Dividing the tasks by animal is the family's best hope of keeping the work of more than a century going, reinforced by strict precautions for anyone approaching the little dip beneath the downs. Post is left in a barrel and the very few visitors not only drive across two belts of disinfectant-soused straw but stand in a bath of the chemical and change into new clothes at the farmhouse.</p> <p>\"If it's all for nothing, and they have to cull animals which are healthy but at 'too high risk', we'll accept it,\" said Mr Wells wearily, hoping that the flock and his little dairy herd will be spared, but acknowledging the wider good.</p> <p>\"We know it's essential that animals are culled to deal with foot and mouth. It is the only way. Vaccination would just be covering up the fact that we'd accepted the disease is here to stay.

      "bodyText": "The Wells family started rearing sheep in Milton Lilbourne not long after William Cobbett spurred his pony across the Wiltshire Downs and approvingly noted the rich grassland in his great political tract, the Rural Rides. But a telephone call at any time could end the four generations of patient lambing and over-wintering at Totteridge farm, where precautions on the scale of a fortress could collapse in the face of the government's draconian new precautions. \"It's like the wartime - which I remember well,\" said David Wells, 67, whose 265 acres form the centre of an island surrounded by three big dairy farms, with foot and mouth's front line less than 10 miles away as the crow flies. \"I sit here looking out of the window and hoping for a great clap of thunder which'll sweep the wretched thing away.\" If ministry vets decide that their 'firebreak barriers' against the infection have got to be widened the phone call might come, and 120 healthy lambs which have lived for less than half a year will be shot. So will their ewes, whose calls - all the same to the human ear but distinctive to the lambs - are now muffled inside Totteridge's barns. Remembering his experiences in the 1967 outbreak - \"It came very close that time,\" he says - Mr Wells is looking after the 150 adult flock in one shed, the lambs in another and the rams out in the fields. On this, and on a pastoral regime as strict as in an ebola ward, depend his hopes of the fifth generation - his son Anthony - taking over the Totteridge sheep when he retires. \"We've done all that we can,\" said Mr Wells, taking a break in the kitchen with his wife Pat and a helper, Clare Giles, who has joined the besieged, mellow stone buildings to help the isolation system work. She looks after the horses while Mr Wells feeds seven cows on an outstation of the farm and his wife takes care of the sheep. Dividing the tasks by animal is the family's best hope of keeping the work of more than a century going, reinforced by strict precautions for anyone approaching the little dip beneath the downs. Post is left in a barrel and the very few visitors not only drive across two belts of disinfectant-soused straw but stand in a bath of the chemical and change into new clothes at the farmhouse. \"If it's all for nothing, and they have to cull animals which are healthy but at 'too high risk', we'll accept it,\" said Mr Wells wearily, hoping that the flock and his little dairy herd will be spared, but acknowledging the wider good. \"We know it's essential that animals are culled to deal with foot and mouth. It is the only way. Vaccination would just be covering up the fact that we'd accepted the disease is here to stay. It has to be wiped out.\" Anthony Wells still wants to inherit Totteridge, a land-holding which was there when King Alfred manoeuvred around Salisbury Plain against the Danes (and had his own disaster nearby, involving cakes). Slaughter or not, his father still hopes for the best, partly thanks to diversification into horse-stabling and carriage-riding - another part of the business which is temporarily paralysed. \"Other farmers are talking of abandoning animals and going back to cereal,\" he said, \"and that'll mean lower quality imported meat in the shops and the end of a lot of high standards which we've maybe come to take for granted.\" If Cobbett rode down again from the high land, with his notebook and power of invective against bad practice, he would find even more to absorb him than he did in 1830.

      "bodyText": "The biggest appeal since the Three Graces was launched yesterday to stop a Michelangelo drawing, potentially the most expensive piece of paper in the world, going abroad. The drawing, one of three by the Renaissance master in private hands, was found in a scrapbook that Simon Howard kept next to his extensive collection of Eric Clapton CDs in the private wing of Castle Howard, the vast family pile in North Yorkshire used for the TV adaptation of Brideshead Revisited. Unless \u00a37.5m can be raised in a few months, the 10in by 6in three-quarter length drawing of a woman in mourning garb will almost certainly go abroad - where it might even break the world record of \u00a38.1m set by Michelangelo's Study for the Risen Christ. Yesterday the National Art Collections Fund pledged \u00a3500,000 towards a campaign led by the National Galleries of Scotland to keep the drawing in Britain - its biggest grant ever for acquiring a drawing. It believes it is important that it goes to a Scottish gallery because there is no Michelangelo in any gallery north of Cambridge. Sir Nicholas Goodison, the fund's chairman, took the highly unusual step of going public with the gift, in order to prompt other possible donors. \"A campaign such as this requires a rapid response,\" he said. \"The fund's \u00a3500,000 gift, one of the largest in our 98-year history, reflects our desire to see this noble and exquisite drawing saved for Scotland.\" A large portion of the asking price needs to be raised in the next five weeks for the bid to succeed. The next step would be to ask the government to place a bar on the export of the drawing to give more time, though that could not happen until it was formally sold. The fund contributed a similar amount to start the \u00a37.6m appeal to keep Canova's Three Graces, the most expensive statue in the world, seven years ago. The drawing's discovery in October was described by the auctioneers Sotheby's as \"the most significant Michelangelo find in living memory; like finding part of the Holy Grail\". One of its specialists, Julien Stock, chanced on it while flicking through the scrapbook of Old Master drawings for a routine insurance evaluation. \"What I thought when I first saw the drawing is unprintable,\" he said. \"I immediately realised this was a major drawing by Michelangelo - and no one had any idea it was here.\" The drawing is thought to have been bought by Henry Howard, 4th Earl of Carlisle, at a London auction in 1747. However, neither he nor anyone else who saw it during the next 250 years realised that it was by Michelangelo. When Mr Stock went through the album into which it had been pasted, he was struck by its superb quality. Tests on the ink and paper were carried out before it was confirmed as a Michelangelo, although its precise dating is unclear. Mr Howard, 44, decided to sell partly because it would be prohibitively expensive to insure the drawing. \"Clearly this is a drawing of importance which has been accepted by all the experts as being by Michelangelo, and as such it should be on display in a national gallery or museum where everyone can enjoy it,\" he said. The money raised by the sale will also help maintain Castle Howard and its 10,000 acre estate. Four years ago the family sold a painting by the Italian artist Il Guercino for \u00a32m. Strictly speaking the drawing belongs not to Mr Howard but to the trustees of his late father, Lord Howard of Henderskelfe, who died in 1983 aged 64.",

      "bodyText": "Key figures in the regime of the former Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic kept high-grade heroin worth tens of millions of pounds in bank vaults in Belgrade for several years, according to the Serbian police, who suspect that they were engaged in trafficking. Following a tip-off from an unnamed source, a team of police officers raided a city centre bank last week and found more than 600kg of 93% pure heroin in the safe deposit boxes. The drugs have a street value of about \u00a340m in western Europe. The Serbian interior minister, Dusan Mihailovic, who exhibited the sealed bricks of heroin before overseeing their burning in furnaces outside Belgrade, said they had been seized from smugglers by Mr Milosevic's customs officers. He said the contract for the bank safe had been taken out by the old regime's state security service. Rade Markovic, a key Milosevic henchman and former state security chief, is in custody awaiting murder charges. Mihalj Kertes, another senior aide to Mr Milosevic throughout his 13-year rule, was the head of the customs service until Serbia's street revolution last October toppled Mr Milosevic. Police sources told a Belgrade newspaper yesterday that a small amount of heroin identical to that discovered last week was found in Mr Kertes's office after Mr Milosevic was overthrown. While the heavily criminal character of the Milosevic regime has long been common knowledge, the drugs disclosure provides evidence of the interaction between Belgrade politics and the underworld in the past 10 years. While Mr Milosevic, in his final year in power, sought to make propaganda out of the fact that Kosovan and Albanian mafias were playing an increasing role in the European drugs rackets, Serbian investigators examining the activities of the old regime are concluding that senior government figures were implicated in organised crime. In a separate case, a former Yugoslav diplomat went on trial in Belgrade on Wednesday on charges of smuggling 33kg of cocaine from Latin America. On Sunday evening a prominent underworld figure, Milan Djordjevic, died in Belgrade in a hail of automatic gunfire. Nicknamed Sweetie, he was a close associate of the late warlord and gangster Arkan. Both men had close connections with the Milosevic regime and could have provided damaging evidence to the new authorities of the corruption and criminality rampant under Mr Milosevic. The heroin saga goes back to 1997 when Yugoslav customs officers impounded 625kg of heroin crossing the Bulgarian border in two lorries, one Slovene, the other Bulgarian. Legally, the drugs haul should have been publicised, the public prosecutor's office given control of the shipment and the drugs burned. But Mr Kertes's customs office gave the heroin to Mr Markovic's state security department, which lodged it in the bank vault. Milos Vasic, an investigative reporter at the weekly magazine Vreme, described the heroin disclosure as the biggest scandal to emerge in Belgrade since last October, and demanded to know whether the Milosevic regime was supplying heroin to Serbian youth or the drug addicts of western Europe. Mr Kertes's relationship with Mr Milosevic goes back to the 1980s, when he organised mass demonstrations in his support as Serbia's new strongman. As a senior police official he later played a central role in supplying arms and funds to Serb rebels in Croatia and Bosnia in the run-up to the wars of 1991-95. And as the head of the customs service, he orchestrated the smuggling and arms-trade rackets devised to beat the United Nations sanc tions imposed on Belgrade in 1992. When Serbia's democratic rulers evicted Mr Kertes from his office last October, they found automatic weapons, explosives and 3m German marks in cash.",

      "bodyText": "The European Union yesterday took its war against people-traffickers into the Balkans from where thousands of illegal immigrants are smuggled into western Europe. Justice and interior ministers, including Britain's home secretary, Jack Straw, pledged in Brussels to send 30 police and immigration officers to help Croatia and Bosnia control their own porous borders and stop the racketeering. According to an internal EU report, up to 200,000 Chinese could be in the former Yugoslavia waiting to be smuggled into the EU - using similar routes to the one used by the 58 Chinese who suffocated to death in a truck bound for Dover last summer. Britain pledged 10 officers, the largest contribution of any member state, and a reflection of the priority that the Blair government now attaches to immigration and asylum. \"The Balkans are the single most important source of illegal immigration into western Europe,\" Mr Straw told fellow ministers. \"If we can close it off or restrict it we are on the way to winning the battle.\" But having responded to an Anglo-Italian initiative to send EU personnel to the front line, ministers found it harder to agree upon common penalties for trafficking. Britain has the toughest maximum sentence of 10 years, while other countries impose terms of up to four years. Mr Straw was criticised for leading an effort to reach agreement with the EU's bigger states, but excluding Sweden, the current holder of the rotating presidency. Mr Straw met colleagues from Germany, France, Italy and Spain in London last week, angering those who want to see EU-wide action, not individual initiatives by some member states. \"This kind of carve-up is an insult to the Swedish presidency and will damage rela tions between the big and smaller EU players,\" protested the Liberal Democrat MEP Graham Watson. \"Why is Jack Straw looking for a back road for policy coordination when the Treaty of Amsterdam has given him a motorway?\" Ministers also agreed that a Swedish-led team should go to Belgrade and Sarajevo, the Serbian and Bosnian capitals respectively, later this month to press for more cooperation from governments there. The 30 police and immigration officers from Britain, Italy, Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands and Austria will advise and train their counterparts in checking visa validity and finding forged passports. In a related move, Britain also proposed that convicted drug traffickers in Europe should have their passports confiscated and be banned from travelling. Britain's minister for immigration, Barbara Roche, outlined a package which includes tough penalties for drug traffickers - a minimum of seven years in jail for a third conviction. It also involves working to improve the anti-drug campaigns of states wanting to join the EU and a \"scoreboard\" approach to make sure that the EU Drugs Action Plan stays on track. Immigration, asylum and criminal and judicial matters - once national concerns - are now a high priority. Last month more than 900 Iraqi Kurds were shipwrecked on the French Riviera, fuelling demands for tighter controls. Dozens of aspiring immigrants drown off Italy and Spain each year crossing from Albania or Morocco. Immigrants are often forced into prostitution or sweated labour to pay debts to traffickers. Today the EU ministers will discuss how to coordinate the fight against trafficking with ministers from the 12 candidate countries in eastern and southern Europe, which also suffer from weak external border controls.",

Her cheeks give off a soft reddish glow. Her demeanour is the opposite of Erin Brockovich, the headstrong, foul-mouthed upstart role that made Roberts the clear favourite to win the best actress award on March 25. She seems more like Mary Reilly, the mousy, English waif she played in 1996 who found herself face to face with Dr Jekyll's Mr Hyde. </p> <p>Somewhere in this room, high up in LA's Regent Beverly Wilshire, some unsuspecting journalist is going to ask the inevitable question. Roberts is Hollywood's premier actress and, at 33, she has weathered more than a dozen years of prying and dumb press questions. </p> <p>She's here promoting The Mexican, her new $35m DreamWorks action comedy with Brad Pitt and James Gandolfini, and she explains how she tries to avoid repeating herself in back-to-back movies. Then one of those questions comes. It always does. Can she explain the differences, a Latino reporter wants to know, between The Mexican and the movie she's filming now, America's Sweethearts? \"Well, you know,\" Roberts replies quickly, lowering her head and then looking up with focused brown eyes. \"The Mexican. Mexican. America's Sweethearts. American. So right there I'm going down the right path.\" </p> <p>Roberts has never exactly enjoyed a great relationship with the media. In an episode of The Simpsons, Homer finds himself trapped in a cinema showing a fake Julia Roberts movie entitled Love is Nice, and loathing every minute of it. And there are heaps of magazines sporting glorious, glossy photos of her in glorious, glossy fashions and replete with words like \"hugely famous\" and wondering \"ain't her life grand?\" But here, long before Roberts enters, some of the reporters are labelling her \"catty\". Even mean. No one asks what her responses might be if she was asked more thought-provoking questions. </p> <p>That messy private life has fuelled a lot of the past press attention she clearly despises. Breaking her engagement to Kiefer Sutherland. Anxiety in the park with Jason Patric. Marrying and then divorcing Lyle Lovett. Living with Liam Neeson. Dating Daniel Day-Lewis. That friendship with Matthew Perry. </p> <p>A German interviewer at the Brockovich press junket asked: \"Did that [performance as Brockovich, a mother of three] make you think of children, imagine yourself as a single mother?\" Roberts replied: \"Doing Pretty Woman didn't make me want to hit the streets! It's as if people are wanting me to procreate . . . This is something I ponder when I go home at night all weary. Why do people keep checking if I'm ovulating?\" </p> <p>Ask a Julia Roberts fan which of her nearly 30 film performances is her best work and, quite often, you'll hear Pretty Woman or My Best Friend's Wedding. Ask Roberts and she'll name neither. \"I guess specifically I could find the good and bad in all the movies,\" she has said. \"But I suppose Erin Brockovich, just in the most general sense, I'm the best in. It was the most challenging, the most well-rounded, had the widest scope of a person to play.\" </p> <p>Brockovich herself says that the film's opening-scene car wreck in LA, a startling, grab-the-moviegoer's-gut crash, actually happened in Las Vegas. It set in motion an odd turn of events that ultimately led to the filming of her story and five Oscar nominations, including Roberts's high-profile race for an award after 10 years without an Academy nomination. </p> <p>Following the wreck, Brockovich went to Los Angeles chiropractor Pamela DuMond. DuMond related the story to another client, Carla Santos Shamberg. She happens to be married to Michael Shamberg. He happens to be a producing partner with Danny DeVito. \"I was pitching Michael something every day of my life,\" Shamberg says. \"On that day I told him I found something.\" Shamberg, who eventually became Brockovich's executive producer, knew that she wanted Roberts to play Brockovich. Her husband's thoughts were, she says: \"I don't get [the story] and you won't get Julia Roberts.\" Roberts not only \"got\" the story but, after reading the script, asked for the part. She also asked for $20m, a salary that only top male actors had commanded. \"I was so happy to give this girl $20m,\" Shamberg says. \"Why shouldn't she make what the boys make?\" </p> <p>In The Mexican, Roberts plays the high-strung, in-your-face girlfriend of Brad Pitt, sent by thugs south of the border to recover a legendary handmade pistol. Roberts's performance often crackles with the same ferocity as the movie's frequent gunfire. </p> <p>With gun in hand, and a willingness to pull the trigger, Roberts is shedding her perceived Melanie Wilkes image for a fully-fledged Scarlett O'Hara. \"It was really original,\" she says of the script. \"Introduce two people in a relationship and then half a minute later separate them - put them in two different countries, in fact.\" Roberts's co-stars praise her and her work ethic. \"She's such a laugh, a charm, a wit,\" Pitt says. \"I liked putting us into a run-and-gun movie.\" </p> <p>Exactly 24 hours after her west coast press interviews, Roberts is striding across the New York stage of David Letterman's chat show. It's one more interview, and Roberts knows that the Late Show host is going to try to rattle her, as she says, \"in the name of fun\". He starts with the Oscars. \"Uh, well, yeah, yeah,\" Roberts says, shifting uncomfortably. \"You know what it is? I'm a grown-up person now. So on that level, it has a different kind of effect on me.\" </p> <p>Letterman keeps on. \"This is what I find myself thinking - and I'm so pleased you asked about the Oscars,\" she says. \"It doesn't rattle my nerves at all. Everybody talks about, you know, uh, 'Do you want to win?' 'What will you say if you win?' And really that bypasses to me a huge step - the excitement and 12-year-old giddiness of, 'I got nominated for an Oscar!' So that's what I'm doing for the next five weeks.\" </p> <p>Letterman keeps on, wondering if, \"as a professional\", she shouldn't be ready with an Oscar speech? Finally, Roberts musters up her most revelatory statement. Words from a woman who's risen to the top of her field, matured in front of our eyes. Words that, perhaps better than most, reflect what she is like now on-screen and off. \"Yes,\" she says. \"However, I think one must be hopeful but expect to remain seated.\" </p> <p>And - who knows - if she does win an Oscar, perhaps even Homer Simpson will become a Julia Roberts fan. </p> <p>\u00a9 New York Times.

Now it's a wealthy white suburb of Los Angeles. Most of the well-tended lawns carry an \"armed response\" sign, a genial death threat to warn off any potential intruders. Little do the residents realise on this sunny Saturday morning that the stocky, debonair man pacing their streets is the embodiment of armed response at its most spectacular. </p> <p>But Yamamoto is just a character in a film. Brother, which tells the story of a yakuza (a gangster) transported to the United States, is the first foreign venture for one of Japan's most celebrated film-makers - Takeshi Kitano, who has also cast himself in the main role. Kitano is rehearsing a brief scene with American actor Omar Epps. Recently seen on screen in Spike Lee's Love and Basketball, The Wood and Breakfast of Champions, Epps is riding a bicycle. This is significant: neither black people nor cyclists are a common sight around these parts. But then, neither are Japanese film-makers - although film production in general is nothing to get excited about. The scene in question is taking place outside a villa which represents the mobster's home. A knife flashes, someone lies dead - it's all over with the minimum of fuss. Kitano works with the speed and efficiency of a contract killer. </p> <p>That was a year ago. After seven weeks of shooting and a few more of editing, Brother is now complete and Kitano is back in LA to talk about this, his ninth film. His first, Violent Cop, was made in 1989, although it was not released in the UK until 1993. At that point, he was best known in Europe for playing a PoW camp guard in Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence, but since then has garnered a fanatical western following for elegantly violent films such as Hana-Bi (Fireworks), which won the Golden Lion at the Venice film festival in 1997, and the earlier Sonatine. </p> <p>On the other hand, the 53-year-old Kitano remains hugely famous in Japan as Beat Takeshi, a stand-up comedian and television personality with seven shows a week. Did he find that humour translated well between cultures? \"I used to think that because of the language I might not be able to understand, but I checked out first of all the ancient comic actors like Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton and the Marx brothers, and then your Mr Bean, and I get the joke. In the 1980s, I used to watch Eddie Murphy [doing stand-up on film] and I found that the subject matter was the same as I used to do in the 1970s in my routine.\" </p> <p>Today he is wearing a black crew-neck jersey and smoking Frontier cigarettes in impressive defiance of the ubiquitous LA nicotine police. Speaking through an interpreter, he tells me: \"When I went to film festivals in Europe and elsewhere, many journalists asked me about the yakuza. I was impressed by how intrigued they were, so I thought, why not make a film about an old-fashioned yakuza and show it to them? Then I thought it would make a greater contrast to set the story outside Japan. His behaviour would have a greater impact, so I had the idea of the yakuza guy going to a foreign country. I happened to write down Los Angeles in the script but without any real significance.\" </p> <p>Then five years ago, at the Toronto film festival, Kitano was having dinner with the British producer Jeremy Thomas (The Last Emperor, The Sheltering Sky, The Hit, Crash, Bad Timing), who produced Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence in 1983. By chance, Thomas asked Kitano if he was interested in making a film outside Japan. </p> <p>The resulting script involves a yakuza gangster, Yamamoto, who is forced to leave Tokyo and travels to LA to meet up with his half-brother Ken (Claude Maki), who is involved in the LA drug world along with Denny (Omar Epps). Yamamoto soon finds himself back in the violent world of gang warfare, taking on LA gangsters of varying ethnic backgrounds. What follows is strictly not for the squeamish: with everything from auto-disembowelment to graphic yakuza-style finger amputation to rat-tat-tat desert massacres, there is enough gore to make Reservoir Dogs look like chihuahuas. Not for nothing does Quentin Tarantino's Rolling Thunder Pictures distribute Kitano's work on video in America, and Tarantino lists Sonatine as one of his five favourite films. </p> <p>Kitano says that he thinks the yakuza do operate in LA but more surreptitiously than in Japan. He says he was wary of making a crime film in a different culture. \"I did not want to make the same mistake as American films which have a yakuza character in them. They are so untrue compared to the reality and as a Japanese person I just have to laugh at the way they are depicted. I was careful because I did not have much knowledge of American gangsters so I decided to treat them as symbolic, not as individual characters. What I did was depersonalise them.\" </p> <p>When Yamamoto and his half- brother collide with American characters, they sometimes provoke predictable responses. One character tells Yamamoto: \"You Japanese are so inscrutable,\" and another talks about \"fucking Jap assholes\". The Japanese, he says, are still often portrayed in the west as stereotypes. \"When people include Japanese characters in films, they are usually the sidekicks of the main character and they use kung fu - which is Chinese - and are depicted in an inaccurate fashion. So I thought, 'If we are going to be treated like that anyway, why not make one film in which the Japanese character was more brutal - and more cool - than any of the American characters?' That was part of my motivation.\" </p> <p>Taiwanese director Ang Lee had just had his film, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, nominated for 10 Oscars when we spoke - a record for a foreign-language film. As Kitano explains: \"In the last 10 or 20 years, American films have globally dominated the market, so whether as a film-maker you live in Tokyo or Taiwan or Hong Kong, you grew up watching American films. So perhaps those kids who grew up watching those movies are now directors and are reproducing what they had acquired. There is now a generation which can make typical American films and certainly there are many Japanese directors who are heavily influenced.\" </p> <p>Before Kitano started shooting in the US, he was prepared to make many compromises. So he was surprised by how little he had to change, although he did discover that there were large differences between the two film cultures.\"I think that the biggest difference is that the American film industry is oriented more towards business than towards artistic considerations. My idea is that, if the film is three hours long and of good quality, it is worth releasing the three-hour version. But in America I was told to cut it to within two hours. It seems that the directors who work in America have to fit this tradition and the whole idea is much more like a business than in Japan. That has a good side to it because it creates a professionalism amongst the crew. They are not sentimental - they don't look on the crew as a family. But they do have a strong pride in their professionalism and a desire not to make any mistakes and that was quite impressive.\" </p> <p>The violence was not a major problem, he says. \"The initial promise from Jeremy Thomas was that I could make the film however I wanted and I was not given any pressure. I had the creative freedom I had been promised.\" Violence in his movies was not an issue in his home country. \"I don't get criticism for it in Japan because in all my films the yakuza is exterminated - what goes around comes around and those who commit violence eventually receive violence from other people as a kind of retribution.\" </p> <p>Despite a serious motorcycle accident in 1994, Kitano's output remains driven and prolific. He hopes that Brother is the first of many films to be shot abroad: \"I have a rough script about boxing which could be shot outside Japan but my most immediate project for which I have almost completed the script is a double suicide love story and the setting will be in modern Japan... I'm thinking of taking a break from violence for a while.\" </p> <p>Brother is released on March 23.</p>",

      "bodyText": "On the coast between Santa Monica and Malibu is Pacific Palisades, where a Methodist group formed a colony in the 1920s \"for moral and cultural betterment\", and where artists and writers lived bohemian-style in the 1940s. Now it's a wealthy white suburb of Los Angeles. Most of the well-tended lawns carry an \"armed response\" sign, a genial death threat to warn off any potential intruders. Little do the residents realise on this sunny Saturday morning that the stocky, debonair man pacing their streets is the embodiment of armed response at its most spectacular. But Yamamoto is just a character in a film. Brother, which tells the story of a yakuza (a gangster) transported to the United States, is the first foreign venture for one of Japan's most celebrated film-makers - Takeshi Kitano, who has also cast himself in the main role. Kitano is rehearsing a brief scene with American actor Omar Epps. Recently seen on screen in Spike Lee's Love and Basketball, The Wood and Breakfast of Champions, Epps is riding a bicycle. This is significant: neither black people nor cyclists are a common sight around these parts. But then, neither are Japanese film-makers - although film production in general is nothing to get excited about. The scene in question is taking place outside a villa which represents the mobster's home. A knife flashes, someone lies dead - it's all over with the minimum of fuss.

      "body": "<p>This is not your usual movie-premiere crowd. Crunched into the American embassy in London's Grosvenor Square, trading insider talk over white wine and stylish canapes, are neither Tara Palmer-Tomkinson nor Caggy off Big Brother, but the rarely glimpsed top brass of transatlantic government. Why, there's the head of the civil service, Sir Richard Wilson. And isn't that Tony Blair's media-shy chief of staff, Jonathan Powell? And look - Francis Richards, the director of GCHQ, inches away from Peter Ricketts, the intelligence coordinator at the Cabinet Office, both rubbing shoulders with Rear Admiral Stanley Bryant, deputy commander of US naval forces in Europe. </p> <p>What movie could possibly have drawn this crowd out? Surely only an MoD information film would warrant the formal attendance of both the defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, and the vice chief of the defence staff? </p> <p>Not so. For this was the London premiere of Thirteen Days, a 145-minute account of 1962's Cuban missile crisis - when John F Kennedy's White House battled Nikita Khrushchev's Kremlin in a game of nuclear chess - from the moment the US spotted Soviet warheads in Cuba, close enough to nuke Washington, until the backroom deal that allowed the world to breathe again. The film, meticulously compiled from memoirs, histories and transcripts garnered from the White House secret taping system (the same one that would eventually trip up Richard Nixon over Watergate), reconstructs at length and in detail the deliberations of the diplomats, advisers and military chiefs who navigated America through the cold war's gravest stand-off. It is a movie where the lead protagonists are white men in suits, all of them government officials. Is it any wonder the Grosvenor Square crowd loved it? </p> <p>Not that politicos have been short of on-screen glamorisation recently. No doubt Wilson, Powell and Co had the home videos whirring last night, taping the West Wing, the White House soap that turns harried and overworked aides into TV heroes. Their counterparts in Washington have long been treated to the likes of Air Force One, Independence Day and The American President - blockbuster films in which the prez is the all-purpose action hero and number-one good guy. </p> <p>But Thirteen Days is different. For one thing, not all the Americans in the movie are goodies. On the contrary, while the Soviet adversary in Moscow is never seen - his presence is felt only in the communiques and secret messages decoded by Kennedy and his team - the president's on-screen opponents are the hardmen of his own military. It is air force General Curtis LeMay the audience wants to boo and hiss when he appears, he and the rest of the uniformed brass who pound the table in their determination to make war. The conflict of Thirteen Days is not Kennedy v Khrushchev, but the dove-ish Kennedy brothers against the hawks of the American military machine. </p> <p>Second, the film-makers have resisted the obvious temptation to make an action thriller in favour of a cerebral one. There are a few whizz-bang shots of US planes in flight but none of the pyrotechnics of other president-as-hero movies. Instead, most of the action takes place in the close, tense rooms of Washington, DC: the Oval Office, the Cabinet Room, the Pentagon, back to the Oval Office. The result is a cinematic claustrophobia that makes for good suspense, but a decidedly old-fashioned film. It's like 12 Angry Men: white guys debating in their shirtsleeves. </p> <p>Third, this movie is pretty accurate. Scholars have noted that Robert Kennedy, shown here as sharing JFK's desire for a negotiated solution, was by the end as much of a hawk as everyone else around the crisis table. Others have questioned whether Kevin Costner's character, Kenny O'Donnell, a trusted retainer and political adviser of the Kennedys, would really have had such a prominent role since his official job was as the president's appointments secretary. But these are niggles. Mostly the film stays scrupulously faithful to the record. </p> <p>Last, and crucially given Costner's involvement, Thirteen Days offers not a single conspiracy theory. This is significant since Hollywood's chief presidential historian until now has been Oliver Stone. It was his JFK, starring Costner as the truth-seeking New Orleans prosecutor Jim Garrison, that injected conspiracy theories into the American mainstream. His Nixon played the same game, rearing a new generation of US cinemagoers on the belief that their country is run by a shadow government of oil men who meet secretly in Texas. (Come to think of it, a glance at the new Bush cabinet suggests Stone may not have been so off the money.) Now Thirteen Days has appeared to offer American audiences a solid slab of history served straight. </p> <p>The result has been a clutch of top-drawer plaudits. The op-ed pages of America's serious papers have been full of praise, with veterans of the Kennedy White House first in the chorus. Historians have welcomed it as a useful and accessible teaching aid; the film-makers say they hope it will soon gain a place on the college curriculum. If the military-diplomatic elite could turn movies into hits, Thirteen Days would be the runaway smash of the year. (As it is, the movie has enjoyed only a modest box office, grossing a moderate $35m so far in the US, less than half of the $75m it cost to make.) </p> <p>So how come? How did Hollywood come to make a film of which Kennedy biographer Richard Reeves says, \"Compared with most of the junk being made these days, Thirteen Days is practically Thucydides\"? </p> <p>The answer may lie with the film's star. Kevin Costner lobbied hard to get this film made, served as its co-producer and is now acting as its chief promoter. In a conversation with him this week, it became clear that Thirteen Days is the film it is partly because Costner is the man he is. </p> <p>Central to it is his attachment to the Kennedys. \"I still chase stories,\" he says in a voice softer and more twangily American than expected. \"And it's not surprising that lives as full as their's would be full of stories.\" But, Costner adds swiftly, it was not the \"tabloid\" tales of Kennedy lore he wanted to tell. </p> <p>\"That family's suffered a lot of pain from being talked about that way,\" he says. \"It never interested me to talk about their personal lives... All of us have feet of clay, all of us would have things that, under a harsh light, we wouldn't want revealed.\" </p> <p>But Costner denies he's trying to restore the Camelot magic, so tarnished by the revelations of JFK's womanising and mafia links. (There are, for example, none of the usual JFK-tossing-a-football shots, no drooling depictions of the beautiful Jackie either.) Nor is Costner a personal friend of the family, doing volunteer PR work. \"I knew Bobby Jnr, Michael and Joseph. We're not pen pals, but I've met them and they know that I've tried to take a professional approach to their family.\" </p> <p>Still, surely the Kennedy clan cannot be too grateful for Costner's JFK, which turned the trade in conspiracy theory into a full blown industry? \"We had the footage, the Zapruder film, so obviously it wasn't a comfortable film for them. But I think that last speech [setting out the great loss America suffered through Kennedy's assassination in 1963], I think they took pride in that.\" </p> <p>So Costner denies a Kennedy fixation, despite playing two men who, in different ways, dedicate their lives to keeping the Kennedy flame. But he does admit to a related motive, one that would explain his reluctance to expose the sleazier underside of the period: a desire to show America's leaders as heroic. </p> <p>\"I hope people who see the film will see a decision-making process that was not about being re-elected or taking the easy decision. The easy decision was not to negotiate - the easy one was to go in and fight. And at the time people were giving [Kennedy] a hard time for not fighting. Yet now, 40 years later, we see that as a highlight. Now we live in a time of instant gratification, you know, 'What will appeal to this demographic or that.' But then they decided to do what was true and what was right.\" </p> <p>Cinematically the result is an uphill climb. For the movie's Kennedy, played expertly by the Canadian actor Bruce Greenwood, is not a conventional hero. He does not growl \"deploy\" as American President Michael Douglas did when he bombed Libya. Nor does he get to fry aliens like Bill Pullman in Independence Day. Instead he is shown weighing conflicting opinions, clutching his aching back as he grapples with indecision. His greatest bravery comes in restraint. This the heroics of hesitancy. </p> <p>To Costner this is the greatest courage of all. For, it turns out, the actor believes in that least fashionable of causes: total nuclear disarmament. </p> <p>\"We still live with this unbelievable threat over our heads of nuclear war,\" he says, his voice rising in both certainty and volume. \"I mean, are we stupid? Do we think that the nuclear threat has gone, that the nuclear destruction of the planet is not imminent? It's a delusion to think it's gone away.\" </p> <p>He hopes the movie will not just be a history lesson, but a wake-up call for the present. \"I hope that people realise the threat is still there - unless we're so numb that we're under some illusion that we're safer now than we were then.\" He cites CNN founder Ted Turner's $250m grant toward global efforts at total disarmament. Does Costner support that? \"Is anybody against it?\" </p> <p>It's an unusual view, especially in America where the consensus holds that the existence of nuclear arsenals on both sides has kept the peace. \"We've been able to stand up to dictators because we can swing for the world. We haven't always known when to swing - we had dumb interests in Vietnam - but I just wish that, when we swing, it isn't with a nuclear right arm.\" </p> <p>To him it's all very obvious. \"I'd like to go to Egypt, but I don't feel it's safe. I'd like to go to Israel or Beirut, or to Yugoslavia the way it used to be. Or Moscow, or the South Pacific. But it's not a safe world, it's a dangerous world.\" (Later, on hearing of this exchange, Thirteen Days co-producer Peter Almond remarks drily: \"We're the only movie in the world with a foreign policy.\") </p> <p>If Kevin Costner, peacenik, is a surprise, the rest of his world view should not be. For there is something in that soft voice, warm tan and freshly gelled hair that suggests a wide-eyed, almost Pollyanna-ish outlook on life. He is, after all, the star of Field of Dreams - the man who told the folk at the US embassy of his pride and heart-felt love of his country. </p> <p>The Costner philosophy is influenced by California - he speaks about being an \"evolved human being\" - but it is quintessentially all-American. It is nostalgic for a simpler era, the days of baseball greats and noble presidents. But it is also, even naively, full of faith and optimism. </p> <p>So the actor refuses to accept that the Kennedy era might have been the golden age of political leadership. He does not believe what some might infer from his new film: that those were the days of giants and today we are ruled by pygmies. </p> <p>\"I think there are good men and women in all decades. You know, we've grown cynical. And look at what we do to all our heroes: Churchill, FDR, Kennedy, they all had affairs. But heroic things happen every day. I believe people who go into politics want to do the right thing. And then they hit a big wall of re-election and the pettiness of politics. In the end, politics gets in the way of the business of people.\" </p> <p>But if the heroic era is not behind us, what about the new man in Kennedy's chair? If George W faced a Cuban missile crisis today, would he act like JFK, weighing all the advice before coming to the wisest, safest decision? </p> <p>\"I'd like to believe that he would. We've had 43 presidents from all across the board. But a good president, a good leader, is not always the smartest man in the room. John [he refers to Kennedy by his first name] combined being a philosopher and a great leader. And George [Bush gets the first-name treatment too] he's leaning heavily on his ability to judge the character of the people in his cabinet. He's going to be more of a delegator.\" </p> <p>But surely the lesson of Thirteen Days is that delegating is not good enough. Ultimately the president must decide alone. \"I'm not about to go tearing [Bush] down. I'm just hoping for the best.\" </p> <p>This Pollyanna-ism extends to his personal politics. Costner won't say how he voted in November, but he does admit to giving money to the campaigns of both Bush and Al Gore. Hedging his bets? \"I wanted to see the debates and I believe in the quality of the argument.\" Plus, he says, he didn't want either candidate thinking he was in the bag. \"I don't vote party line. I vote for the best person.\" It all sounds rather purist. \"I am a purist.\" </p> <p>If Costner is very California and very all-American, he is also very Hollywood. The movie town has always had this attitude to politics: a yearning for purity. You can see it today in West Wing, with Martin Sheen playing Hollywood's dream president - a liberal, ethical good man. But it was there 62 years ago when Jimmy Stewart starred in Frank Capra's Mr Smith Goes to Washington, the story of an outsider who takes on the corruption of Capitol Hill. Perhaps that's the best description of Costner's world-view: Capra-esque. He says he does not see himself as an actor, but as \"a citizen of the world\". </p> <p>Still, that need not be an obstacle. Plenty of Hollywood dreamers have swapped LA for DC, from Ronald Reagan to Sonny Bono. If politics is showbusiness for ugly people, might Kevin Costner ever turn the maxim on his head - and trade movies for elected office? </p> <p>\"No. I want to move faster than that would allow. And the pettiness that has slipped into politics, the 24-hour-a-day process of being re-elected, doesn't appeal to me. And the gridlock, that if something's a good idea for you then it must be a bad idea for the other side.\" </p> <p>So, we shouldn't hold our breath for President Costner just yet. After all, he didn't even grab his chance at playing a president, ceding the Kennedy role in Thirteen Days to Greenwood. Why? \"I don't think I'd have been as good as Bruce was. He was a better JFK than I would have been.\" He's right - but isn't that hard to admit? \"Did you see me stutter?\" he smiles. \"If you don't understand your limitations you won't achieve much in your life.\" Besides, Costner as JFK would have been a distraction: audiences would have been waiting for an impersonation, not a performance. </p> <p>Given all this - the apparent awareness of his own limitations, the apple pie idealism - why is it that Costner has eluded the affection ladled out to the father of Capra-ism, James Stewart, and his modern descendant, Tom Hanks? Why is it that the name Costner prompts as many sniggers as bouquets? Why does he seem to attract so much schadenfreude? Witness the clear pleasure that greeted the bellyflop that was Waterworld or the wave of ignominy currently descending on his latest US release, 3000 Miles to Graceland, a caper movie in which Costner teams with Kurt Russell as a pair of criminal Elvis impersonators. One critic wrote that \"3000 Miles is one of those movies that makes you want to throw up your hands in despair, disgust or maybe both\".

      "bodyText": "This is not your usual movie-premiere crowd. Crunched into the American embassy in London's Grosvenor Square, trading insider talk over white wine and stylish canapes, are neither Tara Palmer-Tomkinson nor Caggy off Big Brother, but the rarely glimpsed top brass of transatlantic government. Why, there's the head of the civil service, Sir Richard Wilson. And isn't that Tony Blair's media-shy chief of staff, Jonathan Powell? And look - Francis Richards, the director of GCHQ, inches away from Peter Ricketts, the intelligence coordinator at the Cabinet Office, both rubbing shoulders with Rear Admiral Stanley Bryant, deputy commander of US naval forces in Europe. What movie could possibly have drawn this crowd out? Surely only an MoD information film would warrant the formal attendance of both the defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, and the vice chief of the defence staff? Not so. For this was the London premiere of Thirteen Days, a 145-minute account of 1962's Cuban missile crisis - when John F Kennedy's White House battled Nikita Khrushchev's Kremlin in a game of nuclear chess - from the moment the US spotted Soviet warheads in Cuba, close enough to nuke Washington, until the backroom deal that allowed the world to breathe again. The film, meticulously compiled from memoirs, histories and transcripts garnered from the White House secret taping system (the same one that would eventually trip up Richard Nixon over Watergate), reconstructs at length and in detail the deliberations of the diplomats, advisers and military chiefs who navigated America through the cold war's gravest stand-off. It is a movie where the lead protagonists are white men in suits, all of them government officials. Is it any wonder the Grosvenor Square crowd loved it? Not that politicos have been short of on-screen glamorisation recently. No doubt Wilson, Powell and Co had the home videos whirring last night, taping the West Wing, the White House soap that turns harried and overworked aides into TV heroes. Their counterparts in Washington have long been treated to the likes of Air Force One, Independence Day and The American President - blockbuster films in which the prez is the all-purpose action hero and number-one good guy. But Thirteen Days is different. For one thing, not all the Americans in the movie are goodies. On the contrary, while the Soviet adversary in Moscow is never seen - his presence is felt only in the communiques and secret messages decoded by Kennedy and his team - the president's on-screen opponents are the hardmen of his own military. It is air force General Curtis LeMay the audience wants to boo and hiss when he appears, he and the rest of the uniformed brass who pound the table in their determination to make war. The conflict of Thirteen Days is not Kennedy v Khrushchev, but the dove-ish Kennedy brothers against the hawks of the American military machine. Second, the film-makers have resisted the obvious temptation to make an action thriller in favour of a cerebral one. There are a few whizz-bang shots of US planes in flight but none of the pyrotechnics of other president-as-hero movies. Instead, most of the action takes place in the close, tense rooms of Washington, DC: the Oval Office, the Cabinet Room, the Pentagon, back to the Oval Office. The result is a cinematic claustrophobia that makes for good suspense, but a decidedly old-fashioned film. It's like 12 Angry Men: white guys debating in their shirtsleeves. Third, this movie is pretty accurate. Scholars have noted that Robert Kennedy, shown here as sharing JFK's desire for a negotiated solution, was by the end as much of a hawk as everyone else around the crisis table. Others have questioned whether Kevin Costner's character, Kenny O'Donnell, a trusted retainer and political adviser of the Kennedys, would really have had such a prominent role since his official job was as the president's appointments secretary. But these are niggles. Mostly the film stays scrupulously faithful to the record. Last, and crucially given Costner's involvement, Thirteen Days offers not a single conspiracy theory. This is significant since Hollywood's chief presidential historian until now has been Oliver Stone. It was his JFK, starring Costner as the truth-seeking New Orleans prosecutor Jim Garrison, that injected conspiracy theories into the American mainstream. His Nixon played the same game, rearing a new generation of US cinemagoers on the belief that their country is run by a shadow government of oil men who meet secretly in Texas. (Come to think of it, a glance at the new Bush cabinet suggests Stone may not have been so off the money.) Now Thirteen Days has appeared to offer American audiences a solid slab of history served straight. The result has been a clutch of top-drawer plaudits. The op-ed pages of America's serious papers have been full of praise, with veterans of the Kennedy White House first in the chorus. Historians have welcomed it as a useful and accessible teaching aid; the film-makers say they hope it will soon gain a place on the college curriculum. If the military-diplomatic elite could turn movies into hits, Thirteen Days would be the runaway smash of the year. (As it is, the movie has enjoyed only a modest box office, grossing a moderate $35m so far in the US, less than half of the $75m it cost to make.) So how come? How did Hollywood come to make a film of which Kennedy biographer Richard Reeves says, \"Compared with most of the junk being made these days, Thirteen Days is practically Thucydides\"? The answer may lie with the film's star. Kevin Costner lobbied hard to get this film made, served as its co-producer and is now acting as its chief promoter. In a conversation with him this week, it became clear that Thirteen Days is the film it is partly because Costner is the man he is. Central to it is his attachment to the Kennedys. \"I still chase stories,\" he says in a voice softer and more twangily American than expected. \"And it's not surprising that lives as full as their's would be full of stories.\" But, Costner adds swiftly, it was not the \"tabloid\" tales of Kennedy lore he wanted to tell. \"That family's suffered a lot of pain from being talked about that way,\" he says. \"It never interested me to talk about their personal lives... All of us have feet of clay, all of us would have things that, under a harsh light, we wouldn't want revealed.\" But Costner denies he's trying to restore the Camelot magic, so tarnished by the revelations of JFK's womanising and mafia links. (There are, for example, none of the usual JFK-tossing-a-football shots, no drooling depictions of the beautiful Jackie either.) Nor is Costner a personal friend of the family, doing volunteer PR work. \"I knew Bobby Jnr, Michael and Joseph. We're not pen pals, but I've met them and they know that I've tried to take a professional approach to their family.\" Still, surely the Kennedy clan cannot be too grateful for Costner's JFK, which turned the trade in conspiracy theory into a full blown industry? \"We had the footage, the Zapruder film, so obviously it wasn't a comfortable film for them. But I think that last speech [setting out the great loss America suffered through Kennedy's assassination in 1963], I think they took pride in that.\" So Costner denies a Kennedy fixation, despite playing two men who, in different ways, dedicate their lives to keeping the Kennedy flame. But he does admit to a related motive, one that would explain his reluctance to expose the sleazier underside of the period: a desire to show America's leaders as heroic. \"I hope people who see the film will see a decision-making process that was not about being re-elected or taking the easy decision. The easy decision was not to negotiate - the easy one was to go in and fight. And at the time people were giving [Kennedy] a hard time for not fighting. Yet now, 40 years later, we see that as a highlight. Now we live in a time of instant gratification, you know, 'What will appeal to this demographic or that.' But then they decided to do what was true and what was right.\" Cinematically the result is an uphill climb. For the movie's Kennedy, played expertly by the Canadian actor Bruce Greenwood, is not a conventional hero. He does not growl \"deploy\" as American President Michael Douglas did when he bombed Libya. Nor does he get to fry aliens like Bill Pullman in Independence Day. Instead he is shown weighing conflicting opinions, clutching his aching back as he grapples with indecision. His greatest bravery comes in restraint. This the heroics of hesitancy. To Costner this is the greatest courage of all. For, it turns out, the actor believes in that least fashionable of causes: total nuclear disarmament. \"We still live with this unbelievable threat over our heads of nuclear war,\" he says, his voice rising in both certainty and volume. \"I mean, are we stupid? Do we think that the nuclear threat has gone, that the nuclear destruction of the planet is not imminent? It's a delusion to think it's gone away.\" He hopes the movie will not just be a history lesson, but a wake-up call for the present. \"I hope that people realise the threat is still there - unless we're so numb that we're under some illusion that we're safer now than we were then.\" He cites CNN founder Ted Turner's $250m grant toward global efforts at total disarmament. Does Costner support that? \"Is anybody against it?\" It's an unusual view, especially in America where the consensus holds that the existence of nuclear arsenals on both sides has kept the peace. \"We've been able to stand up to dictators because we can swing for the world. We haven't always known when to swing - we had dumb interests in Vietnam - but I just wish that, when we swing, it isn't with a nuclear right arm.\" To him it's all very obvious. \"I'd like to go to Egypt, but I don't feel it's safe. I'd like to go to Israel or Beirut, or to Yugoslavia the way it used to be. Or Moscow, or the South Pacific. But it's not a safe world, it's a dangerous world.\" (Later, on hearing of this exchange, Thirteen Days co-producer Peter Almond remarks drily: \"We're the only movie in the world with a foreign policy.\") If Kevin Costner, peacenik, is a surprise, the rest of his world view should not be. For there is something in that soft voice, warm tan and freshly gelled hair that suggests a wide-eyed, almost Pollyanna-ish outlook on life. He is, after all, the star of Field of Dreams - the man who told the folk at the US embassy of his pride and heart-felt love of his country. The Costner philosophy is influenced by California - he speaks about being an \"evolved human being\" - but it is quintessentially all-American. It is nostalgic for a simpler era, the days of baseball greats and noble presidents. But it is also, even naively, full of faith and optimism. So the actor refuses to accept that the Kennedy era might have been the golden age of political leadership. He does not believe what some might infer from his new film: that those were the days of giants and today we are ruled by pygmies. \"I think there are good men and women in all decades. You know, we've grown cynical. And look at what we do to all our heroes: Churchill, FDR, Kennedy, they all had affairs. But heroic things happen every day. I believe people who go into politics want to do the right thing. And then they hit a big wall of re-election and the pettiness of politics. In the end, politics gets in the way of the business of people.\" But if the heroic era is not behind us, what about the new man in Kennedy's chair? If George W faced a Cuban missile crisis today, would he act like JFK, weighing all the advice before coming to the wisest, safest decision? \"I'd like to believe that he would. We've had 43 presidents from all across the board. But a good president, a good leader, is not always the smartest man in the room. John [he refers to Kennedy by his first name] combined being a philosopher and a great leader. And George [Bush gets the first-name treatment too] he's leaning heavily on his ability to judge the character of the people in his cabinet. He's going to be more of a delegator.\" But surely the lesson of Thirteen Days is that delegating is not good enough. Ultimately the president must decide alone. \"I'm not about to go tearing [Bush] down. I'm just hoping for the best.\" This Pollyanna-ism extends to his personal politics. Costner won't say how he voted in November, but he does admit to giving money to the campaigns of both Bush and Al Gore. Hedging his bets? \"I wanted to see the debates and I believe in the quality of the argument.\" Plus, he says, he didn't want either candidate thinking he was in the bag. \"I don't vote party line. I vote for the best person.\" It all sounds rather purist. \"I am a purist.\" If Costner is very California and very all-American, he is also very Hollywood. The movie town has always had this attitude to politics: a yearning for purity. You can see it today in West Wing, with Martin Sheen playing Hollywood's dream president - a liberal, ethical good man. But it was there 62 years ago when Jimmy Stewart starred in Frank Capra's Mr Smith Goes to Washington, the story of an outsider who takes on the corruption of Capitol Hill. Perhaps that's the best description of Costner's world-view: Capra-esque. He says he does not see himself as an actor, but as \"a citizen of the world\". Still, that need not be an obstacle. Plenty of Hollywood dreamers have swapped LA for DC, from Ronald Reagan to Sonny Bono. If politics is showbusiness for ugly people, might Kevin Costner ever turn the maxim on his head - and trade movies for elected office? \"No. I want to move faster than that would allow. And the pettiness that has slipped into politics, the 24-hour-a-day process of being re-elected, doesn't appeal to me. And the gridlock, that if something's a good idea for you then it must be a bad idea for the other side.\" So, we shouldn't hold our breath for President Costner just yet. After all, he didn't even grab his chance at playing a president, ceding the Kennedy role in Thirteen Days to Greenwood. Why? \"I don't think I'd have been as good as Bruce was. He was a better JFK than I would have been.\" He's right - but isn't that hard to admit? \"Did you see me stutter?\" he smiles. \"If you don't understand your limitations you won't achieve much in your life.\" Besides, Costner as JFK would have been a distraction: audiences would have been waiting for an impersonation, not a performance. Given all this - the apparent awareness of his own limitations, the apple pie idealism - why is it that Costner has eluded the affection ladled out to the father of Capra-ism, James Stewart, and his modern descendant, Tom Hanks? Why is it that the name Costner prompts as many sniggers as bouquets? Why does he seem to attract so much schadenfreude? Witness the clear pleasure that greeted the bellyflop that was Waterworld or the wave of ignominy currently descending on his latest US release, 3000 Miles to Graceland, a caper movie in which Costner teams with Kurt Russell as a pair of criminal Elvis impersonators. One critic wrote that \"3000 Miles is one of those movies that makes you want to throw up your hands in despair, disgust or maybe both\". Another declared: \"The picture feels longer than Presley's career and as irrelevant as he was by the end.\" The key to this lack of kindness may lie somewhere in the black-and-white sequences of In Bed with Madonna, the singer's fly-on-the-wall documentary about her world tour of 1990. One scene shows Costner, fresh from his multiple-Oscar winning triumph with Dances with Wolves, popping backstage after catching her show. He tells the star he thought it was \"neat\" - at which Madonna sticks a finger down her throat in a mock barf. Madonna tends to have a good instinct for popular feeling. Did she know that most of her audience would feel the same way as she did about Costner, that there is something about him just a little uncool? Costner is not taking the bait. He refuses to ape the director of the new Russell Crowe-Meg Ryan vehicle and diss his own film. \"It's kind of a B-movie. And I helped a young director get it made and I'm very proud of that. I'm proud of all the movies I've made. They're not sequels, they're not franchises. And the reason I pick my films carefully is that I don't want to spit on my life.

But what if you've grown up and the ex-best friend still sucks lollipops and plays kids' records? And what if he just wants to hang out with you and do what you used to do? And what if that was \"Chuck &amp; Buck, Suck &amp; Fuck\", as Buck reminds Chuck? This is a funny, disarmingly simple film dominated by the permanent, bland smile of Mike White, whose emotionally stunted protagonist sets off to LA to be near his best buddy (now a successful record executive) and takes his disappointments out by writing an autobiographical play, Hank &amp; Frank. White, who also wrote the film, and Chris Weitz (a bit of a Tom Cruise lookalike, which makes it funnier) don't put a foot wrong, and Miguel Arteta's film is not like anything you've seen: imagine Fatal Attraction rewritten by a benign gay 12-year-old. I haven't been this exquisitely embarrassed since Happiness. </p> <p><strong>Dirty Pictures</strong> <br> Rental MGM Cert 18<br> Perfect timing for this intelligently argued TV movie about the trial of a Cincinnati art centre director for obscenity following the 1990 exhibition of Robert Mapplethorpe's photos. The arguments closely mirror those of the current Saatchi exhibition hoo-ha. This is no dry discussion programme on obscenity v art, but an intelligently written and argued reconstruction with James Woods in top form as the gallery owner forced unhappily into the role of defender of art and free speech amid threats, intimidation and bribery. He is no straight-arrow hero figure, but a flawed and self-doubting character which, like Russell Crowe's whistleblower in The Insider, makes him an unusually lifelike kind of hero: this, you feel, is the best you might do in an awful situation, muddling through and getting it right some of the time. Craig T Nelson is equally uncaricatured as the sheriff taking the expected stance in an election year. You get to see the photos and the usual rightwing suspects - Jesse Helms, Pat Buchanan and George Bush - appear in TV footage while Salman Rushdie is interviewed on the side of freedom of expression. Dirty Pictures won the Golden Globe for best TV movie. Many of Woods's finest performances never make it to the cinema - if you spot Citizen Cohn (tautly directed, like this, by Frank Pierson) or Promise in the racks, do yourself a favour. </p> <p><strong>Liberty Heights</strong><br> Rental Warner Cert 15<br></p> <p>This is writer-director Barry Levinson back in Baltimore, a positive recommendation for fans of Diner, Tin Men and Avalon. Levinson goes back to 1954 (five years before Diner) - \"No Jews, dogs or coloreds\" is the sign on the local swimming pool. \"Burlesk\" is dying but Joe Mantegna's head of the family is still eking out a living from presenting it, augmented by running an illegal numbers racket. His sons are getting interested in girls outside the tight little Jewish community that gives the film its title. This lets Levinson compare black life with the Wasp well-to-do. Even if it's all a little too schematic for its own good and the dialogue doesn't quite have the snap of his best work, it's still an enjoyable, bittersweet experience that never drags at two hours. Mantegna is typically unfussy and authoritative.</p>",

Aoyama can then casually approach the one he likes best for a date.</p> <p>Of course, the casting-couch try-out is hardly a novelty, and the audition scene here is shot like every audition scene in every film you\u2019ve ever seen: with a jokey collage of clips of all the desperately unsuitable hopefuls. But what makes the audition here interesting is the elaborate, almost glacial formality with which Aoyama and Yoshikawa devise a plan which pleasingly matches the power relations between director and actress with those between husband and wife. Earnestly, and with no sense that what they are doing is in any sense disreputable, Miike\u2019s director and producer have scripted what they hope is a happy beginning and a happy ending to Aoyama\u2019s second marriage.</p> <p>But it isn\u2019t long before Yoshikawa senses something wrong with the tall, willowy beauty with whom Aoyama falls head over heels in love. She is an ex-dancer, Asami Yamasaki, played by the former Benetton model Eihi Shiina.

What his doomed hero experiences is not eros, but thanatos - Freud\u2019s \u201cdeath instinct\u201d. He is unbearably moved, and obscurely excited by her tale of having had to give up dance because of an injury to her hips and ecstatically tells her in the fateful audition that her stoic acceptance of this was like accepting death itself.</p> <p>All of this is an unsettling augury - and Asami is a terrifying avenger, making manifest the pain and death that Aoyama senses in the audition process and visiting it on Aoyama himself, not merely as a punishment for the male sexual triumphalism inherent in Japanese society, but a gratification of his dark masochism of the spirit.</p> <p>And it really is pretty scary stuff.

But somewhere within it is the screech of pain and the cry of pleasure: a lurid nightmare in which the power relations between women and men are acted out in the most barbarously extreme way.

Mr Klimov could not confirm the nationality of the hijackers, but said: \"We are guiding ourselves by the fact that one of the demands was an end to the war in Chechnya.\" The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, remained at an exclusive ski resort in southern Siberia where he has been with his family since Tuesday. His spokesman on Chechnya, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, said the president had asked for a crisis team to be set up in Moscow. Another aide said the president had stressed that the priority in negotiations was to secure the safe release of the passengers. Attention-grabbing tactics were used by Chechen rebels and their sympathisers in the years leading up to and during the 1994-96 war. The most bloody event was the 1995 siege of a hospital in the southern Russia town of Budyonnovsk, where around 1,500 people were taken hostage by Chechen warlord Shamil Basayev and a band of fighters. Around 150 people were killed in the standoff. Picture gallery Hijacked plane",

HSBC believes \"the group's growth profile is clearly superior to that of the general food sector\". If you like things already cleaned and chopped, this is probably a stock for you.",

Whether it was his burgeoning reputation or the colourful, popular programme (Ravel, Rodrigo, Respighi) that drew the crowds is hard to say. Perhaps it was a bit of both. Zanetti has been attracting some eye-catching reviews, especially since his recent appointment as music director of Antwerp's Vlaamse Opera. The news can hardly have failed to reach CBSO regulars. </p> <p>Zanetti began with Ravel's Rhapsodie Espagnole. This was a brave choice: the velvety nocturnal textures of the opening Pr\u00e9lude \u00e0 la Nuit don't always work in large concert halls - especially not at the top of a concert programme. The magic is fragile, and a conductor needs to create a really riveting hush if the sounds aren't to be drowned out by programme-rustling, coughing and behinds settling noisily in seats. Zanetti did just that. The silky string tone, the subtle but intense phrasing - you just had to listen. The auditorium was silent. Living up to a beginning like that is quite a challenge though, and it wasn't until the final virtuosic Feria that Zanetti was able to create atmosphere and excitement to match that enticing beginning. </p> <p>There was one unusual offering in this Mediterranean-based programme: Contemplazione by Alfredo Catalani, a contemporary of Puccini's, and composer of the once-popular opera La Wally. The programme note compared it to Wagner and Mahler, but in Zanetti's performance it sounded closer to Ravel: refined, langorous but emotionally reserved. </p> <p>Respighi's noisy, garish Feste Romane made an excellent finale, though. In Zanetti's performance there was plenty of energy, sweeping phrasing and spectacular colour, matched by technical precision. The whole thing was like a gloriously over-the-top Hollywood film-score, with all the opulent vulgarity and skill expected of the genre. It made me keen to hear what he can do in the opera house.</p>",

Singer Melanie Pappenheim demonstrates her remarkable gift for singing poetry backwards in Butterfly Song, a deconstruction of a text by James I that Pook wrote for the TV film Butterfly Collectors. The concert opens with an engaging fantasy on messages left on Pook's answerphone, in which tiny fragments of speech are turned into sumptuous instrumental melodies. But Pook's most audacious use of sampling comes in Arsenal: Trevor's Conversion, in which she crafts a serene charm from the earthy vigour of recorded football chants. </p> <p>But even here, Pook's music is reflective rather than dramatic. Attractive for four or five numbers, a whole concert of this music requires the sweetest of sweet tooths. Each number begins to sound like an epilogue for an action that never happens. It's a music that demands passivity from its audience, something that is emphasised by the deliberate obscurity of the texts sung in the concert.
